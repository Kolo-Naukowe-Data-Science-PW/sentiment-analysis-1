"Ran",2014-04-27,"nonspoiler discussion of the show goes here for those whove not read the books or those who have but are happy to not actually reference them at all in discussion taking each episode as it comes this topic should open automatically when the show begins airing"
"AryaSansa",2014-04-28,"great episodeâ i like the part with margerys grandmother and finding out she was part of the plot with little finger â my guess is little finger kills who hes going to marry then hits on sansaâ â afterwards hound and arya meet up with sansa then the hound kills little finger for sansa and marries sansa â stannis will march on the wall then punish locke by cutting off his hand like locke did with jaimeâ eventually jaime and locke will fight each other both with one hand eachâ stannis is pretty evil so maybe hell imprison jon snow because he was robb starks brotherâ maybe have jon snow burned to death jon will eventually come out alive because hes too important of a character  no one else seems important up north â bran will escape somehow too early for him to dieâ if he dies his whole storyline will be a wasteâ also that little boy will shoot ygritte and kill her for revenge â margery will marry tommen but cersei will eventually find out and punish herâ or perhaps margery will get tommen to execute cersei firstâ but tywin is still in control so there will be a power struggle between margery and tywinâ i expect tywin to lose and possibly die â as for danaerys i dont really care too much about their plot its taking forever to reach westerosâ i hope that gray worm and the translator hook up though they seem to be such a cute couple â also i expect jaime to fight for tyrion as his champion at his trialâ but tywin and cersei wont let him so tyrion will probably need to find a new champion  maybe the dornish guy who likes to have sex a lotâ i hope the dornish guy dies all he does is have sex hes getting annoyingâ hope jaime dies for raping cersei too among other despicable deeds  like killling his nephew trying to kill bran and injuring ned starkâ maybe cersei will have him executedâ â or maybe the horny dude oberyn will be cerseis champion while jaime will be tyrions and jaime will die to oberyn â the rape at crasters keep was a bit much but the best part of game of thrones is its realismâ rape incest and misogyny were very common in european culture throughout history even today â cant wait for next episode edited by aryasansa 28 april 2014  0858 am"
"piles",2014-04-28,"â the rape at crasters keep was a bit much but the best part of game of thrones is its realismâ â i particularly enjoy its neorealistic depiction of dragons  white walkers"
"Bastard of the Dreadfort",2014-04-28,"â stannis will march on the wall then punish locke by cutting off his hand like locke did with jaimeâ eventually jaime and locke will fight each other both with one hand each â â â i wish"
"lessassin",2014-04-28,"â also i expect jaime to fight for tyrion as his champion at his trialâ but tywin and cersei wont let him â â i dont believe that possible jaime is not left handed he cant fight i believe the only chance tyrion has is to run awayâ"
"Petyr Patter",2014-04-28,"â i particularly enjoy its neorealistic depiction of dragons  white walkers â well aryasansa did say the best parts were the realistic onesâ which is an opinion i can appreciate"
"Jennelyn",2014-04-28,"â â as for danaerys i dont really care too much about their plot its taking forever to reach westerosâ i hope that gray worm and the translator hook up though they seem to be such a cute coupleâ â â except that gray worm has no cock so i hope hes good at other things"
"SerArthurHeath",2014-04-29,"bit harsh on modern europe"
"The brown snake",2014-04-29,"no dragons no greyjoys no martells but pod was preety awesome it was good to find out once for all who killed joffery"
"AryaSansa",2014-04-29,"â i particularly enjoy its neorealistic depiction of dragons  white walkers â to me realism in a fantasy show is less about science but more about consistency in the rules of the universe and the character motivations â â â i dont believe that possible jaime is not left handed he cant fight i believe the only chance tyrion has is to run awayâ â true but why else would they devote so much time to jaimes swordtraining unless he is to fight someone later onâ â â it seems odd that the lannisters were so forgiving of jaimes hand being cut off  i would have expected them to seek retributionâ â another possible plotline could be lockes journey to redemption and make him into a good guy  slim chance but it would be cool to see him change into a good person by being around jon snowâ maybe jon snow saves his life â â â â â except that gray worm has no cock so i hope hes good at other things â well he still has his tongue and his fingers so as long as he knows how to use them â â â"
"lessassin",2014-04-29,"true but why else would they devote so much time to jaimes swordtraining unless he is to fight someone later onâ â â it seems odd that the lannisters were so forgiving of jaimes hand being cut off  i would have expected them to seek retributionâ â another possible plotline could be lockes journey to redemption and make him into a good guy  slim chance but it would be cool to see him change into a good person by being around jon snowâ maybe jon snow saves his life â i believe jaime would fight but not for tyrion cersei would do anything to kill tyrion and probably use a humungus knight or something like that and jaime can bearly fight bronn it would take him years to learn tyrion has like a month tops besides in the trailer of the season theres a fight between the prince oberyn and some enourmous guy my guess is the mountain maybe thats tyrions trial the training of jaime is all about hes ashamed he cant do the only thing he was good at fighting i dont believe theres any redemption from locke its quite clear that guy is some manipulative sadistic asshole he would do anything to bring the stark boys to the boltons keep"
"AryaSansa",2014-04-30,"â i believe jaime would fight but not for tyrion cersei would do anything to kill tyrion and probably use a humungus knight or something like that and jaime can bearly fight bronn it would take him years to learn tyrion has like a month tops besides in the trailer of the season theres a fight between the prince oberyn and some enourmous guy my guess is the mountain maybe thats tyrions trial the training of jaime is all about hes ashamed he cant do the only thing he was good at fighting i dont believe theres any redemption from locke its quite clear that guy is some manipulative sadistic asshole he would do anything to bring the stark boys to the boltons keep â oh that would be a good fightâ finally somthing for oberyn to do besides have sexâ â â i wonder why tommen doesnt just pardon tyrionâ or at least talk to him they should at least show tommen being denied by cerseiâ tyrion is a popular character so i doubt hell die  sean bean died but the shock value of execution is gone now so his chances of survival will be higher â maybe locke becomes a spy for bolton when he cant kill branâ bran will definitely make it out alive or else his whole storyline will be a waste â i still think jaime will fight with his left againâ seems like such a waste of a storyline jaime loses a fight almost dies but uses a dirty trick taught by bronn to save himself and kill his opponent â i wish he didnt give his sword away though what will he use nowâ â maybe he can use joffreys sword â would have been nice to see margary let tommen touch her exposed breast just to show that theres no social boundary shes wont cross to achieve her goalâ margary feels too wholesome now would be nice to give her a dark side"
"Thrones123",2014-04-30,"in kings landing â you can tell that jaime and cersei are not as close as they used to be even more so after the rape â weird to see jaime do many things the opposite of what she wanted him to do â she wanted him to kill tyrion  he goes and talks to him believes he didnt kill joffery seems like he wants to help him somehow and tells him he wont kill him she wants sansa to be killed he sends of briennewith his sword and pod to go and protect sansa â seems like there is now way tyrion survives the whole ordeal but just got a feeling he prolly will â at the wall â jon seems to be getting respect from the fellow nights watch except for the higher ups who still dont seem to like them they think they are sending him to his death but sure jon will be able to pull it out i guess locke isnt a highbornnoble if no one is able to recognize him pretty fancy coincidence that he was set by bolton to kill bran and rickon and bran just happens to be going the place where him and jon are heading why would he volunteer for the mission north of the wall if he was sent to kill bran he has no clue they are north of the wall is he just going to try and kill jon no news from the wildlings they have to be getting closer â mereen no big surprise dany is able to take over the city feel like she is starting to bite off more than she can chew only a matter of time before the slaves start acting up is this the last city she takes over before she heads west â no sign of theon or ramsey guess they are still on mission to take over whatever castle it was that bolton said also no sign of theons sister this season as she is still supposed to be on the way to save theon â little finger still has something up his sleeve for sansa no way he is doing it just to do it unless the martells told him they wanted her safe which is possible"
"SheRa Seastar",2014-04-30,"i liked the swirly valerian steel in oathkeeper didnt notice it in joffreys sword â i also liked danys new hairdo those meereenese know how to do a nice braid"
"Jennelyn",2014-04-30,"â at the wall â jon seems to be getting respect from the fellow nights watch except for the higher ups who still dont seem to like them they think they are sending him to his death but sure jon will be able to pull it out i guess locke isnt a highbornnoble if no one is able to recognize him pretty fancy coincidence that he was set by bolton to kill bran and rickon and bran just happens to be going the place where him and jon are heading why would he volunteer for the mission north of the wall if he was sent to kill bran he has no clue they are north of the wall is he just going to try and kill jon no news from the wildlings they have to be getting closer â didnt locke overhear jon talking to sam about bran even if he didnt hear anything hes probably sticking close to jon in order to find out if hes hiding his brothers somewhere"
"Thrones123",2014-05-01,"â didnt locke overhear jon talking to sam about bran even if he didnt hear anything hes probably sticking close to jon in order to find out if hes hiding his brothers somewhere â yeah i think he at least showed up in the room when they were talking at the end of when they were talking so he might of overheard something any chance you think locke turns good maybe if hes north of the wall and they run into a white walker and realizes the potential danger the whole realm is in he sides with jon"
"MockingbirdSpider",2014-05-01,"this is episode had some insanely good scenes and unfortunately some rather cheesy ones what i would particularly like to comment on is danys storyline whenever shes on screen i feel a bit bored and that usually never is the case when got is on tv to me her scenes are definitely the weakest part of an otherwise outstanding season 04 that is shaping up to be the best of this show so far â while danys storyline was easily one of the most fascinating ones back when the show started it has become less and less interesting to me throughout season 3 and season 4 so far i find it somewhat repetitive to see her free one slave city after another while it was rather epic when she killed kraznys freed astapor and acquired the army of unsullied the rest of the slave cities were pretty stereotypical and the scenes in which she freed them somewhat anticlimactic kill the masters written in a language that the slaves apparently dont even speak  i mean seriously the problem with danys storyline is that although im sure what shes doing now  getting armies watching as her dragons grow stronger with every day  will have major implications in the future its so detached from whats going on in westeros all the other storylines seem interwoven at least to a certain extent but danys is almost like an entirely separate story i think its time she heads to westeros i dont necessarily expect her to actually get there anytime soon but ive had enough of slave cities friendzoned mr mormont and smoothtalking dario her storyline needs a new twist a new direction she also needs to experience some major setback  a dragon could get ill one of her counselors mormont maybe dies etc something upsetting so far its been all smooth sailing for her ever since she left qarthâ"

"Thrones123",2014-05-02,"i think dany will start seeing some opposition over the next couple of episodes think she is starting to outkick her coverage she willshould have trouble controlling however many slaves it is 2 cities worth 200000ish think she has too much power comparative to what she actually does her armies and generals for lack of a better term do all the work"
"Eire",2014-06-24,"spoilers hello my name is eire and i am new here i have read got 14 and have started on book 5 i wanted to post on this topic to write about the white walkers and my opinion on seeing them in a kingdom after picking up the baby this is just me speculating so bear with me and not everyone has to agree rather than have a white walker kingdom with a king and so on i always thought the white walkers were something more primitive the white walkers are not human anatomically they have humanoid featuresexcept their exterior integumentay system  but they are not humans while the show may want to make them have a king city and palace is up to the show and gr martin and that is okay but i think it is comparing them too much to the other houses of westeros i always thought that the whitewalkers were more primitive in nature and acted similar in some ways to a tribe or a pack maybe they do not have an alpha  beta omega gamma  or zeta like a wolf pack does but psychology wise they lack fear  mercy and bliss that makes a human instead for the others these emotions are replaced with insticts that weigh heavily on dominance  and submissiveness an example of this episode was the first season of the first episode when they let that guy go because he submitted the white walkers understandor sense that humans are different in their way of thinking  and so they exploit it  by acting on their fear tell me what you think please i welcome all comments i love the whitewalkersâ they are mysterious and evil  and i love it i liked the entire episode and everything that we learned about the whitewalkers from it until i saw a kingdom  and a ruler like they can have a god and a king but i hope the showbooks remembers they are not humans and not to make them too general and less mysterious otherwise everything would feel very anticlamatic â"

"averde",2014-04-27,"this was my favorite episode so far this season like come on ser pounce was in it in all seriousness though pretty good episode with a lot of interesting material that im happy to have on the show that tied in nicely with the books the whole others thing at end was interesting i guess im not sure how i feel about it horse guy potentially coldhands"
"Jabronius Maximus",2014-04-27,"hmm im really not liking where the bran story id going it seems as though they altered it to make him seem relevant but that might come back to bite them either that or it ends up being a small detour as ghost and summer free them still not a fan of it decent episode otherwise and crasters sonsbecome others i wasnt expecting to find that out from the show"

"Zman1863",2014-04-27,"very good episode the book deviations in the north are a bit contrived but i think its working so far they did a good job of building up the tension in that story line i liked the kl stuff also the jaime stuff is presented as if nothing unusual happened last episode which tells me they totally failed to convey what they thought in the rape scene if you pretend the scene happens as it did in the books it all works"
"of man and wolf",2014-04-27,"how is this show uneventful things are happening that havent even happened in the books and we got glimpses into the future perhaps â dont mind the changes its the tv show creative license and all â â the fact we have the direwolves back and looking big and mean is great not sure how theyd be captured so easily though they are going to be big trouble for the mutineers soon"

"Cyvasse Khal",2014-04-28,"8 for me this week thought it was a really good move the story along kind of episode and found myself liking the book deviations â positives  lfsansa lf getting sansa to talk through his moves was a great step in immediately showing that sansa is about to start learning the game  locke what great use of him this is just the kind of plan roose would make and locke made castle black so much more interesting  olennamargaerytommen from olenna schooling margaery in feminine manipulation to the bedroom visit so margaery can lure tommen away from cerseis grasp all very well executed and ser pounce  bran i might be disagreeing with most here but liking he has a bit of extra danger to deal with his story was really flatlining but business has picked up now  thorneslynt may be only a small part of it but janos just reminding thorne that jon is pretty popular and an election needs to be held so they gotta do something about that was good because that was pretty important info there and it was nice to see these two actually strategising instead of being asses  whitewalkers it felt like the right time to show these guys again i also love that they are pushing this ambiguity of good or evil they are scary as hell but we havent seen them do anything evil and them being referred to as godlike beings by crasters wives really shows we cant see them as villains or monsters  podbrienne pods 30 seconds shows real promise to get some houndarya style comedy moments in the future â negatives  tyrionjaime i wasnt feeling that conversation it felt too soap operalike with the constant reminder of the sonbrothersisterunclefather intertwined family stuff we get it you guys are in a screwed up family  samjon so sick of sam glad he wasnt in it for long his trip to oldtown better be a lot more riveting  meereen i found the whole sequence weird the grey worm opening was odd they went straight from 1 master about to be killed to oh dany won again usual dany speech  crasters keep ive seen that actor before in a couple of other things but he was way ott in his delivery i just found him weird instead of finding him intimidating edited by cyvasse khal 28 april 2014  1007 am"

"darksellsword",2014-04-28,"this is the first time ive given an episode a 10  just fantastic episode 4 has been the best at least these last seasons this episode spun my head around like something from the exorcist it just blew my mind at first i had a huge problem with the ghost being captured scene like other people i was sure it couldnt happen and was confused about why they would keep ghost alive but after i thought about the changes they had already made with ghost not being with jon when he went with the wildlings and instead fighting with lord commander mormont at the fist even saving sam from a white walker my explanation for what we saw last night is the self proclaimed fucking legend of gin alley saw what ghost can do to a white and thought rather have it around than dead at the very least it might give us a signal if there are whites around i think sam put ghost in the cage before the mutiny happened it might also be possible that some of the mutineers like jon he had his run in with craster too they could also be scared of him he has after all been smacking the shit out of them in training anyway i think there are more reasons to keep ghost alive than to just stab him especially if he was in the cage before the mutiny my only problems with this episode were danys scenes being rushed i have always liked emilia clarkes portrayal of dany however last nights i will answer injustice with justice â  was cringe worthy to say the least and the scene with greyworm learning the common tongue was irritating and pointless whoever posted about the queen of thorns saying it was all the rage thanks because now it really bugs me too its been a while since i was able to sit on the edge of my seat with the other viewers like i did the first season before i read the books so thanks for that dd i did laugh to myself during the jaime and tyrion scene because they are supposed to be brothers but their accents are nothing alike i think peter dinklage is great as tyrion but his accent does veer off into the austin powers impersonation territory i had noticed that tywin and jaime have very similar accents perhaps they should of sent peter dinklage to the same dialect coach or just sat him down with a boxset of everything charles dance has ever been in although they should really do that with every actor on the show to be fairi am going to say it the margery visiting tommen in his bedroom scene was hot i can just imagine what it would of been like for me at his age to have a hot woman like margery coming to my bed at night and telling me that i will own her soonit was made even more sexually charged by the margery scene that preceded it with the queen of thorns stories of her sexploits and then encouraging margery to do the same with tommen the reveal of the nights king at the end transforming one of crasters babies into a white walker will have us all theorizing for months at least until the next book comes out cough after the end of this season edited by darksellsword 28 april 2014  1215 pm"

harbinger of chaos anarchy and ruinâ and it makes for someâ fucked up television viewing when you area in a room with two pregnant womanâ that shit is fuckedâ<U+0080><U+009D>â  jon snow in my mindâ â so when i watched the dumpy guy take the last of crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s sons out to die in the snow it almost made me wretchâ â watching a helpless baby be left in the snow to die listening to it cry watching it struggle to stay warm was a heartwrenching physically uncomfortable thing for me to watchâ and as i was watching it â<U+0080><U+0093> with friends two of whom are pregnant women i was almost shivering not from the cold â<U+0080><U+0093>but from my nerves not wanting to listen to a little baby die in the cold aloneâ â and that was powerfulâ deeply gutwrenchingly powerful â maybe a tad unnecessary though but i admire the guts it took to stay on that sound of the baby crying â i like the pushtheenvelope way of making that scene â â and it made me realize that whether or not the enemies on the other side of the wall are the walkers depraved wildinglings or the barbarism that comes from living without any rules the â<U+0080><U+009C>realms of menâ<U+0080><U+009D> has to stand for somethingâ and a society that allows its babies to die in the snow or that allows its men to rape or that allows any form of slavery or that allows rules rights and property to be eradicated so cavalierly where itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s the hound last week or cersei with tyrion this one if we root for anyone in this show it has to be the people that will stand up against that kind of lawlessness cruelty depravity and ruinâ that person can be dany stannis or maybe even tommenâ but westeroes needs that person fast i think the show made a strong case for this worlds need for those kinds of people â â the redemption in order to read this you almost have to ignore the butcher job the show did on jaime last weekâ you have to ignore the fact that jaime raped cersei last week and just do what i did just pretend they left the part where cersei said â<U+0080><U+009C>yesâ<U+0080><U+009D> on the cutting room floor because the director and show runners apparently donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know

jaime is pretending is his nephew while his father tries to be the one man to rule them all â the actor and the writing for jaime have been with one open obvious and troubling exception exceptionalâ he is becoming a different man not because itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a cheap way to get the actor some facetime though the man owns it when heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s onscreen it is a detailed and hard look at a man who must â<U+0080><U+009C>reinventâ<U+0080><U+009D> himself in a world where that does not happen much at allâ he does the right thingsâ and for the right reasons and none of it is easy fuck jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s easiest decision was probably whether or not to kill aerysâ â the scene with him and tyrion was as good as a scene between two witty and intelligent men can be

came to dany too easilyâ i can see thatâ but you know whatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s worseâ having to stand around reading needless chapters about something that you know is going to happen anywayâ just â<U+0080> where is the chase and how do i cut to itâ dd cut to the chase and gave people a good duality between â<U+0080><U+009C>freedomâ<U+0080><U+009D> and â<U+0080><U+009C>slaveryâ<U+0080><U+009D> â people want to be free even though they may have been conditioned to or even born into slaveryâ they may be told day after day â<U+0080><U+0093> that their lives belong to others and worse that they should be grateful for their chainsâ and that has been true for the united states circa 1858 to sparta 444bcâ slaveowners have made an artform of declaring that their slaves not only should be slaves but want to be slaves there are a host of bullshit stories from sparta to south carolina that describe this condition itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a loadâ but given the choiceâ â better to live a day free than a lifetime in chains â even if that one day was at crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s keepâ<U+0080> a baby born who becomes a white walkerâ how much better is that than being a slave your whole lifeâ â and what of the woman who freed themâ the show kept the nailedslave masters and showed how brutal she can be and how she refuses to stepoutside her own cycle of crueltyâ this is while barristan looks on and wonders to himself wisely â<U+0080><U+009C>is she just or madâ or bothâ<U+0080><U+009D>â â â and all the while dany is putting more and more people on her back leading them toâ<U+0080> whatâ salvationâ freedom westeroes to me those few scenes encapsulated the fight for danyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s soul she is bringing freedom to people and in doing so may be chaining herself to their misery dany is the only character we look at and must think â<U+0080><U+009C>areâ<U+0080> are we watching the birth of a villainâ<U+0080><U+009D>â and in this world can we tell the difference anymore â the future killer sansaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s education is off to a perfect start and i like how the show unveiled not only her understanding but that the show didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t beat around the bush to reveal who killed joffâ regardless tyrionâ<U+0080><U+0099>s one line about sansa â<U+0080><U+009C>sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not a killerâ<U+0080> not yet anywayâ<U+0080>â<U+0080><U+009D> was the perfect blend of honesty and foreshadowingâ â the king and the queen third timeâ<U+0080><U+0099>sâ a charm good scene utterly unrealistic but i can live with itâ showed that maergery can play the game a number of different waysâ well doneâ and i was so grateful they did not have sex because that would have spawned a â<U+0080><U+009C>pointcounterpointâ<U+0080><U+009D> on this weekâ<U+0080><U+0099>s rape scene v last weekâ<U+0080><U+0099>s rape sceneâ â jon snow now with a pulse i liked that jon in the show has more life and more complexity than the emmofuck in the booksâ i think his speech to his brothers was legit and it sets up his promotion nicely and i really like that he knows about bran â much better than the alternative which was in the book and makes no sense not even a little â â what i am on the fence about â the atlanta of the world beyond the wall the city of atlanta georgia is a gigantic airline hub almost every flight that crosses into that area stops in atlantaâ there is a saying among people in the south â<U+0080><U+009C>when you die you may be going to heaven or you may be going to hell but you will sure have to stop to change flights in atlantaâ<U+0080><U+009D>â â soâ<U+0080> does everyone is the great vast arctic hell that is the land beyond the wall have to stop at crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s keepâ letâ<U+0080><U+0099>s seeâ<U+0080> jon snow bran the nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s watch the white walkers who use it as the worst takeout joint in westeroes etc â<U+0080><U+0093> they all stop into this placeâ<U+0080> in a world that has been described as so vast you cannot keep track of anythingâ but now we have â<U+0080> everyone â<U+0080> hereâ<U+0080> jojen rast ghostâ<U+0080> the gang is all hereâ<U+0080> â and why are the blackbrother mutineers keeping ghostâ who the fuck knows other than as a convenient plot devise which has me concernedâ â now the question is will this be a useful plot point or a shameless plot deviseâ martin has said repeatedly â<U+0080><U+0093>that the hardest character for him to write was bran and this is true in the books where bran does very very littleâ the shoe cannot keep paying these actors to walk around for 10 episodes and have all of 3 scenesâ they have to do somethingâ and â<U+0080> now they are â and it looks so painfully contrivedâ so utterly contrived to get the actors in the show to do somethingâ its taken 4 episodes to doâ<U+0080> that and it â<U+0080> looks terribleâ the only thing holding it together are bran and the reedsâ the actors are nailing it and thank god for that because the story looks terribleâ â i know that i will be accused of being a â<U+0080><U+009C>book puristâ<U+0080><U+009D> but if you are going to go offscriptâ<U+0080> fucking have a point donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t do it just to do itâ going offbook can pay huge dividends robert and cersei tywin and arya but if done badly it can be ludicrously awkward the brotherhood without banners being a tight groupâ<U+0080> unless a hot red woman wants to buy one of you shae a waste of time dany in qath or prove to be the worst scene in the showâ<U+0080><U+0099>s 35year run cerseiâ and jaime in the sept â this is feeling eerily like rozâ i always felt roz was there because you needed somebody to true together all the loose disparate parts of the showâ and it always smacked of lazy writingâ â thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s what i feel about thisâ that bran at crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s is just a lazy way to try to coagulate a pretty diffused storyâ in the book its not a problemâ in the showâ itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a problemâ but this is not how to solve itâ they went offbook and did it in the most hamfisted and clumsy way possibleâ and its so obvious and so unnecessaryâ i know dd are â<U+0080><U+009C>geniusesâ<U+0080><U+009D> and they now apparently believe itâ they think they can do no wrong â and that may be correct but right now bran at crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s seems forced sloppy lazy and convolutedâ â prove me wrongâ â borg 20 so when star trek tng released their movie with the borg 100 years ago they used the borg as the bad guys a civilization based on the fact that every borg was exactly the same as every other and there was no individualityâ and then in the movie they introduced â<U+0080><U+009C>the first borgâ<U+0080><U+009D> and it looked contrived and silly and turned what made the borg so interesting their lack of individuality backwards thus destroying the villainy of themâ cut to last nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s episode with the introduction of the night king and i am getting the same feelingâ a lame â<U+0080><U+009C>headâ<U+0080><U+009D> of a seemingly headless enemyâ the king seems very human and seems to be there for one purpose to eventually be destroyed so the white walkers can be defeatedâ this was probably something martin had in mind and i really donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have a problem with it either wayâ but in the show and the book it always seemed a little â<U+0080> pedestrianâ like itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s the part of the books that is a bad fantasy trope and we are all looking the other wayâ â what i did not like â not been here not done that so this episode was the most offbook to dtae and i will not repeat what i wrote aboveâ butâ<U+0080> its also the weakest episode in a while and the weakest parts were â<U+0080> the new ones see aboveâ where was stannis tywin aryaâ are they not interesting enough for you so we â<U+0080> have to learn about the shitty people who are raping and raping and fucking raping we get it no need to show us again in the background these womenâ we have to watch branâ see ghost chained up why againâ whatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s the pointâ i mean other than to get your moneyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s worth from their contractsâ â look go offbookâ its fine and at times has been done very wellâ even last night meargery  tommen was goodâ but last night was a very uneven allovertheplace episode that seemed only

"Alia Atreides",2014-04-28,"new here usually i just lurk and read the other comments and after reading through everyones interesting in some aspects opinions on last nights episode i would like to add my own as well  â at first when the hubby and i watched we were like wtf in the whole thing of jon knowing bran was alive already i hold the books in a way scared and for me their changing that hurt samwells character at least within the books but as is being shown for whatever reasons so far things are being changed in someways small changes weve not encountered coldhands yet nor did sam vow not to tell jon that bran was alive which for me brought even more strength to samwell in the books to hold back from jon his brother took a real courage he could of ended his pain but took his vow to not tell more seriousâ â i am enjoying that i now think of it in hindsight the capture of my beloved ghost another change i was not expecting but as i said last night we dont know what ghost was up to when he was on the other side of the wall and jon and him were separated jon could not feel him at all and he had no idea perhaps he had been captured and ripped apart the black brothers who betrayed them all it would not of been something that could of in a way been told in the books or perhaps it is a foretelling of what is going to happen in wow that we will go back and then go forward once again in the timeframe â i disagree to a point in this whole new branjon storyline etc and the boltons sending in someone to the wall i am quite curious as to how this will now play out and where it will leave stannis  the lord of light but we still have six more episodes to go to find out â i loved sir pounce simply adorable to have him we need a bit of love in a series so froth with war betrayal and death â i think i despise littleprick even more now as he makes my skin crawl everytime he is near sansa as he does within the books i am trying to take it in a way even thought i am a book purist in a lot of series to try and remember that within the books we only have pov of that particular character and other perceive them â and not what their true thoughts are but i still think even if we ever get a pov of littleprick it will still be slimy etc â â i know a lot has been said of the whole raping etc but i find the truth in this and not so much disturbing as it being the realities of war or simply being a savage animal at timesâ â i am really curious to see if they will have any sort of a kissing scene with margarey and tommen even thought they aged him up he still is a baby  the actor playing him etc â i enjoyed the whole thing as well with the white walkers and remember its magic so yea that is why the baby didnt die of any frostbite before he got to the altar i think that is about it from me sorry it it is long winded"

"QueenSansa2",2014-04-29,"hey all just got registered for this forum ive been waiting to be confirmed and have a lot pent up so this is a bit longâ i went through this whole topic and am surprised i didnt find what i was looking for to be discussed so new points and be easy on me ive only read the books once so i may have missed a few things 1 brienne and jaime interaction the last thing we know in the books is that brienne was being hung for not returning the daughters to catelyn one of the biggest debates among fans is whether brienne is alive or not her last word was jaime people think she lived because she would promise to catelyn that she would avenge her and kill jaime so the debate is  would brienne kill jaime or would she not kill him and would she just be a sad woman who died with many unfulfilled oaths i was really interested in the interaction between them on the show and watched closely when brienne took the sword and named it oathkeeper did anyone else notice the eye contact language when that happened there were several awkward seconds of it they both seem kind of sad and afraid of what that meant to call her sword oathkeeper to me that meant an understanding that if it came to it she would keep the oath she first kept with catelyn meaning jaimie understood that meant that he could die by her oath and that brienne was sadly letting him know that i mean that several awkward seconds of eye contact language could mean nothing or it could mean exactly that i was just disappointed that the show would hint to the answer of that mystery that martin hasnt told yet 2 margaery and tommen along the same lines tommen was described as a nice little boy who liked to play with his kittens and that he got along well with margary correct me if im wrong but i think she got him those kittens she was using tactics in the book to appeal to a child when cersei wants to know who margaery is fing she does all that she can to find out who marg gets alone with and she is told that marg is never alone and always with her friends and girl friends she wouldnt even believe that it would be tommen that she was sleeping with it was never implied that marg would be sneaking around and having sexual relations with tommen so that could mean that marg actually lost her virginity to tommen and not anyone else meaning she would win the trial and cersei had it all wrong duh i thought the show pointing into this relationship that is secret even in the book destroyed that mystery cersei will never know their little secret until the coming books but we do now so that mystery untold by martin is now destroyed not surprising again and im not crying over it but still disappointing that we have to find out from the show before we can read it i was kind of intrigued at the idea that marg had lied about being a virgin 3 margaery varys and the children people have been asking how did marg get into tommens room i am almost definitely certain marg varys and the orphan children are all working together marg appeared from the shadows and i think she came through a secret path that varys showed her the last sentence of the last book really had me asking questions i had forgotten that the children were his birds varys is an orphan those children are orphans and when i was rewatching some episodes from previous got seasons and watching marg stop her cart in the streets to go talk to the children i forgot the episode made orphans by the war she makes them like her and then says that if they need anything to go straight to her her connection with orphan children really has me suspecting shes working with varys when varys in the last books says for the children it makes me think that he killed kevan because he was about to start another war making more orphans 4 i mean we all know now who poisoned joffrey this was debated before this episode 5 sansas not a killer yet ok thanks for that obvious foreshadowing 6 you all have already talked about the others in depth is anyone else peeved about all this changes with the show i can grudgingly accept because they are two separate entities and they can take creative license to condense a complex story but telling us what martin hasnt told us yet the things i listed are considerably minor but its only just begun hbo is just getting started with telling us what happens in the next books"

"Seneti",2014-04-28,"i like a lot that they have bran  co doing something although i am fearful of jon meeting up with bran in the books the starks have been separated so long and it doesnt make much sense to me thematically at least to have them get together would jon really let him continue on which we know that hed have to that aside terrific episode â i dont think hes going to have much of a choice i think either â 1 bran and co will escape in the middle of the fight between jon5 and the mutineers and jon wont be able to stop him â 2 locke will reveal himself to be a traitor by trying to kill bran and jon will realize that here is no safe place for his brother that  duty will make him let bran go â sooooowho what the hell was that thing and what did he do to the baby obviously he is a maker of white walkers but who is he what is he did you notice how he was dressed wowthis episode was awesome they arent going by the book for sure on many arcs but i gotta say i dont mind its damned fine storytelling visually beautiful and fun not knowing exactly what is gonna happen ive also heard a ton of hype on some alleged very disturbing scene that was possibly on tonight maybe the rape fest and drinking from mormonts skull going on at crasters i personally would like to see bran and jon meet would definitely help expose us and the charachters to more of the magical elements and maybe help jon make better decisions at the wall at some point the arcs are going to have to start acknowledging the magical elements that are showing up guess i have to wait til next week to see about the jon  bran meeting  loved this episode though â apparently hbo credited the horned ww as the night king and has a graphic violence warning for next weeks episode i shudder to think what that means â i think its more likely that were going to find that the hbo show and the books are starting to tell two different stories using the same characters and settings its my understanding from my wife that this happened with the show true blood the show and the books became substantially different as the series went along grrm knows the series will probably end before the books i doubt that he is going to have the series ruin surprises he has in store for us in the books â actually grrm has already told dd all the ends to all the major plot lines who  if anyone  will set the it what will the starks targs and lannisters end up being and doing whats going to happen with the ww so we can assume that the ending is going to be roughly the same but lots of details along the road will be different"

"metr0man",2014-04-28,"i frikken loved it the whole second half the episode was one holy shift moment after another as a book reader im very happy the show is letting paths intersect more since this is probably only a seven season show they need to get on with the endgame oh wow what if jon meets meera and jojen they are reeds they might know what howland knows omg what if we find out rlj this season edited by metr0man 28 april 2014  0118 am"

"Niboosmik",2014-04-28,"im not pleased with the fact that it seems the tv show just spoiled the unreleased book with martins comments about going deeper into the north than we ever have before in twow i imagine we find out where crasters sons go or what happens to themwelp now i already knowâ â the show is good the books are better if that is a spoler i may have to stop watching the show i love the show but i cant have an altered adapation ruin a story thats been in the making for twenty years my thoughts exactly as much as i drool over those cgi direwolves"

"The Anti-Targ",2014-04-28,"most of the additions are just make work to keep bran from getting too far ahead while everyone elses plots are still trying to get to the end of asos all that is fine and necessary but jon knowing about bran is bad bad bad not a good adaptational change at all â and how the fork did ghost get captured and why would the traitors keep him locked up instead of killing him stupid and why hasnt jon been fretting about ghost youd think he would be expecting to see ghost back at the wall by the time he returned and wondering where he is but no not even a mention about how odd it is that ghost isnt there this is just silly and lazy writing but not a criminal departure from the books so in the end the only maddening aspect of tonights episode is jon knowing about bran well also disappointed about how mereen went down when is ser jorahs treachery going to be revealed"

"jarl the climber",2014-04-28,"ive said i disapprove of the missandeigrey worm storyline because the shows already following so many to add a new one thats not even in the bookâ thats my major nitpick â going after the craster mutineers is a departure from the books but it seems like a natural oneâ the same as the scene with stannis sentencing davos to death after he freed gendryâ it seems these were logical things to happen even if the book didnt cover them â but at this point you have to say the shows gone off on a lot of tangents from the book thats going to lead to different endingsâ at least for some of the characters i actually liked the grey wormmissandei scene it added a dimension to the characters that we have not gotten in the books i like how their attitude changed when dany walked into the tent they sort of put their masks back on they do not completely trust dany and are following her for now for their own reasons â the whole thing with crasters is interesting i sort of thought it was possible that thorne and the other five rangers that jon sent out might have gone after the mutineers at crasters on their own iniative and now they sort of flipped things with thorne sending jonâ"

"W1NT3RF3LL",2014-04-28,"really i get more frustrated each episode everything is wrong some things get us to the same point  have to be changed to film  i get that butgilly in moles town the wildlings are insane jon knows bran is alive  is going to crasters bran is at crasters the whole thing is a mess one of my favorite things about the books is that things are not always fair good people die  it isnt fair the characters are not purely good or evil save a few  for me the show is ruining that the whole reason jon snow thinks its possible to make good with the wildlings is because he realizes they are just people some are good some are bad the show has painted them all as some savage lunatics i suppose in an attempt for us to root for their deaths no way those chumps at crasters couldve captured ghost im just afraid they are going to change the whole story line are the show  the books going to end up in the same place if not it will be very disappointing for me im glad you all enjoyed the episode but for me its just moving too far away from the booksah i think you are going a little overboard really in the books until jon allows them to come through we see them as bunch of savages even jon has his own motives to as why he allows them through one of them being that he doesnt want them to turn into ww the other is he grew fond of them while he was with them i think it will all come together"
"rocksniffer",2014-04-28,"maybe if jon does meet up with bran and co theyll even teach jon how to use his powers of warging that so far he hasnt even touched just a thought â i am curious about this too after all that talent might prove invaluable in the futurewouldnt the rest of the sullied herein agree â â i just watched the ep so ill need some more time to let it sink in but yeah i agree that oathkeeper turned out interestingly i was shocked about everything related to bran in this ep but not outraged and right now im dying to find out what this seed theyve planted will grow to be like â i just love the element of surprise they gave in this episode as a book reader i miss that a lot so for me deviating from the books is certainly a positive thing ive quit whining about what theyre doing to the show since it became clear its going to outrun the books id choose surprise over spoiler anytime so im not that worried about what dd are planning to do next â my thoughts exactlymost of the changes from the beginning have really just tightened up the story and made it both a great book series and a great tv series â â its a little weird isnt it were so used to knowing what will happen or how deviations can string back together in the future but a scene like the end of this episode is a reminder of how fun it must be to watch this show as an unsullied mind you i still enjoy the show immensely but that sense of uncertainty suspense and mystery is lost a lot of the time because of our knowledge of the source material â didnt think it was possible but im even more excited for twow now â and perhaps having a different take on things we thought we knew will make the reveals coming in twow more exciting rather than ruining the story a some believe â im not sure why book fans like this episode so much â we already knew what was happening at crasters keep after the mutiny ghost hunted down and killed some of the perpetrators getting bran mired in everything there is nothing more than pointless filler plain and simple gods help us if he and jon are reunited the titular scene  oathkeeper  seemed shorter than grey worms completely superfluous language lesson from missandei the overthrow of meereen was anticlimactic and danys masscrucifixion of people she thought might have crucified the slave girls coming soon to a westeros near you was glossed over that cheap cgi targaryen flag was atrocious too â thankfully at least saint tyrion of house whitewashing didnt give jaime the idea to send brienne after sansa with oathkeeper and pod â a week after the outrage over gratuitously and grotesquely mutilating a major character arc by having him rape one of the only persons in the world whom he loves and is loyal if it wasnt supposed to be rape then why did the writers and directors describe it as rape and forcing himself on her hm we have loads of gruesome rape at crasters keep totally necessary im sure its not like theres more story to tell â i get that many were disturbed by the last epi and the sex on the alter scene and even though i respect everyones right to an opinion mine is that rape child abuse and murder are part of this story in the books as well as the showso why did it shock anyonein addition although ghost avenging the mutiny was ok for the books really getting to see what was going on and how the women were chanting for example made that whole part of the story a fuller representation of things i had only imagined â what about the hours of gratuitous sex this show throws in our face the split second rape scene at crasters least has a point in by showing us how utterly despicable those traitorous pieces of excrement are whats the point of all the sex  nudity this show is known for 99 of the time it does nothing to advance the story or develop the characters â as a fan of gratuitous sex on hbo for more than 30 years anyone else remember that hbo used to only show rrated films after 9 pm what shocks me is that people are outraged by seeing things that the books never shrink fromgrrm describes sex in vivid detail throughout the books so whats wrong with seeing it â â on one hand thats a fair comment but on the other hand the whole reason dd were allowed to make the series was because they proved to george that they loved the books they got the books they understood george â so when we all were given this explanation while we understand and expect that there will be variations some have been mind blowing some have been just plain annoying and some have made people bloody angry â or at the least unhappy â when robbs marriage arc was totally changed for example you immediately knew it was because the rest of jeynes story would be a cipher â i would have rather read that in the next book â my dearest fragile bird i find myself disagreeing with the premise that making changes somehow lessens dds respect and understanding of the storysure people always get annoyedmyself includedwhen a filmmaker changes important parts of a story  i am reminded of cujo and the fate of the boybut i do not think the books are inviolate in fact i am of the opinion that several of the changes have enhanced my appreciation for the story and its rich textureâ â as for robb and jeyne i didnt get that change but in the grand scheme i guess it hasnt impacted me that much and like you i also believe the journey is at least as important as the end result if not more so â that being said i am not sure that my desire to read the final books has been lessened by what the show has changed or revealed about the paths taken by the main characters â just more mutterings from your favorite salty old asshole â"

"Miodrag",2014-04-28,"what i will always fail to understand is why certain people believe deviations from the novel lessen the quality of the show â it probably has to do with the fact that the vast majority of changes was for the worse for example danydrogo wedding night in the show was criticized only not because it happened before jaime pushing bran which wouldve been nothing but pointless nitpicking but because the scene was significantly altered and the change made the scene more cliched and predictable and a layer in their story was lost were only criticizing the deviations there are actually damaging to the story it is not our responsibility that every single change  save a few  made the story much weaker than it couldve been had dd stayed close to the novels â a the books arent perfect â bookadmirers actually know that therefore when books are discussed criticizers usually dont get attacked and ridiculed and educated on the nature of the medium in question complaints get challenged of course just like they should instead of simply being dismissed as trolling but its not books imperfections that are problematic because even with imperfections asoiaf novels are great literature tv shows imperfections are the actual trouble because some apparently think tv show is perfect or at the very least not to be criticized â b they are separate entities â has anyone denied that â c some of this stuff is really really cool â for you perhaps for me not so much but anyway cool is not the attribute i respect that much id rather for characters and twists and developments and plotlines to be meaningful and deep and skillful than cool"

sam made a promise in the book not to tell anyone that bran was still alive â now im worried about how this will change everything in the north â all of the battles etc  including rooses claim to the north is that all of the starks are dead â rooses claim stems from tywin making him warden of the north and demotion of the house stark by the lannisters after the death of king robb technically bran is king in the north but he isnt actively taking part in the liberation movement so the movement is still squashed and as others say the watch takes no part until the bastard letter â im not pleased with the fact that it seems the tv show just spoiled the unreleased book with martins comments about going deeper into the north than we ever have before in twow i imagine we find out where crasters sons go or what happens to themwelp now i already knowâ â the show is good the books are better if that is a spoler i may have to stop watching the show i love the show but i cant have an altered adapation ruin a story thats been in the making for twenty years â i agree ive never downloaded a gotepisode i honestly didnt know about it when the show came on saw the first episode in a college course liked it bought the first season dvdbox and when i finished that the second season came out on dvd i started reading the books waited a year and bought the season 3 dvdbox now theres a hbodiscount special for 4 months half price so im on with that you cant retake the offer if youve had it less then a year ago and im not willing to pay full price meaning that ill have to wait two years until the season 5 dvd box comes out by that time my patience will have grown thin but twow will have come out â bran at crasters is a good arc that i dont mind but goddamnit that others spoiler â completely agree the bran plot doesnt really change anything aside from coldhands taking care of the rogue mutineers if bran and jon dont meet up and it explains why ghost took so long to get to castle black who knows the mutineers may scatter after bran wargs into hodor and breaks free then they may meet with chs and they have that moment in which bran realizes that chs has picked off the remaining mutineers seeing their corpses through summer â the last scene was an unnessary additionâ i really loathe it â i didnt dislike the episode but after every week i start to feel more and more like a book snob i dont like that feeling since almost everyone i know are show only so i just hope the payoff works out well enough with the story heres to hoping â i feel the same i really loved the simple changes they made to jaimesbriennespods storyline this week everything jaime this week was spot on even if it didnt correlate with the books â â noâ in the books coldhands only kills wrights to

better had the scene been in the books iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d have also thought it contrived â no in the books coldhands deals with foes he refuses to name and goes looking for food while the reeds bran and hodor are shivering in a hut somewhere near a lake bran wargs into summer and finds dead nights watch bodies eats that and thats when coldhands returns with meat of dubious origin himself â its because theres no point to it thats why its called gratuitous and the fact that im a grown ass man who has seen a p or 2 in his life im looking for something more with my dramas like moving the story forward as well as developing 1 of the 100 characters this show has brought into the fold rather than staring at boobies  wieners every episode if i wanted that id pop in a porno which has more of a point than got sex scenes gdammit â you didnt answer the question its gratuitous in the books as well so apparently despite your claim of being a grown ass man you have an issue with visual sex but not written sex while both are gratuitous you dont want gratuitous sex just say so go read 50shades of grey or whatever â ive got two points to make in regardes to the common criticisms im seeing in this thread sam broke his promise to bran and told jon he is alive sam never made a promise to bran in the show in the books he made his promise to coldhands and coldhands isnt in the show not yet at least nobody ever asked sam to keep it a secret so there is no reason to expect him to not tell jon that his younger brother whom is believed dead is in fact alive this doesnt mean roose is going to find out you guys are saying that because jon knows bran is alive rooses claim to the north is lessened and stannis jon stark plan is pointless why would either jon or sam tell roose that bran is alive and stannis plan was turned down anyways i doubt jon will be sending ravens across westeros to let everyone know that my crippled little brother is on the other side of the wall so please dont try to steal winterfell thats ludacris and nobody would believe it besides the watch takes no part there is nothing important in the books regarding jon not knowing about bran they made the wildlings evil im going to preface my point by saying that the cannibalism thing is quite cheesy and i dont like it however youre still incorrect the wildlings werent made to be bad guys at all the thenns were never good guys anyways they arent free folk the thenns are organized and ruthless tormen wasnt made evil he clearly doesnt like the nasty shit thenns do and neither does ygritte rattleshirt is an ass in the show but he is one in the books and mance wasnt made very evil either this complaint just confuses me â i think a lot of the criticism towards this episode stems from book readers not being able to cope with change somebody earlier said that jon going to crasters and bran being at crasters was a mess its not a mess its called a story its not convoluted at all and everything makes sense the mutineers at crasters were completely forgotten about in the books jon wanting to deal with them makes sense bran hearing a baby in the woods and wanting to investigate makes sense the mutineers being total douchebags makes sense theyre criminals sent to the wall that betrayed their lord commander this adds more danger and excitement to brans story since he doesnt do much for a good long while and even by the end of a dance with dragons he hasnt done muchâ jon doesnt do much either right now hes basically just waiting for stannis granted ygritte and companys attack on castle black has yet to happen but you know its coming â as for the white walker at the end we all knew the show was going to go past the books the show is slated for 7 seasons thats three and a half more after next week to cover the rest of a storm of swords a feast for crows a dance with dragons the winds of winter and the final book things are going to get condensed fat is going to get trimmed and winter is likely going to come a little quicker you cant honestly expect the show to put itself on hold to wait for grrm to take another 10 years to finish the series â im sorry but with the rate their going through asosp2 it is clear that they are fully able to condense whatever storylines of feastdance in season 5 leaving whatever comes in winds and dream for s67 there was no need at all to bring in the nights king of all things at this point in time theyre covering the stuff from book 3 and parts of 45 theres no need to jump from a scene that happened in book 3 to a scene that has direct relevance to book 6 the gap theyre jumping is far far too wide and it will only make the storylines more disjointed then they already are"
"Rockroi",2014-04-28,"â â i think a lot of the criticism towards this episode stems from book readers not being able to cope with change somebody earlier said that jon going to crasters and bran being at crasters was a mess its not a mess its called a story its not convoluted at all and everything makes sense the mutineers at crasters were completely forgotten about in the books jon wanting to deal with them makes sense bran hearing a baby in the woods and wanting to investigate makes sense the mutineers being total douchebags makes sense theyre criminals sent to the wall that betrayed their lord commander this adds more danger and excitement to brans story since he doesnt do much for a good long while and even by the end of a dance with dragons he hasnt done muchâ jon doesnt do much either right now hes basically just waiting for stannis granted ygritte and companys attack on castle black has yet to happen but you know its coming â as for the white walker at the end we all knew the show was going to go past the books the show is slated for 7 seasons thats three and a half more after next week to cover the rest of a storm of swords a feast for crows a dance with dragons the winds of winter and the final book things are going to get condensed fat is going to get trimmed and winter is likely going to come a little quicker you cant honestly expect the show to put itself on hold to wait for grrm to take another 10 years to finish the series â no â plenty of changes from the book have been worthwhile its when the changes are dead or convoluted that draws ire â yeah sure some people are just the ultrapurists and you cant satisfy them they want a 50 hour season with a virtually unlimited budget â â my complaint is when the story is overrun by contrivance â here its having bran end up at this place that  just so happens to be where jon wanted the nw to attack â quelle supriseâ and it just so happens that bran was right thereâ â and that ghost is there â why â howd they catch him for what purpose â any idea â anyone anyone â bueler â â it makes no sense â it only makes sense if the goal was to get everyone there because well you are paying these people anyway and you need to put something on that screen â so  you sort of contrive to put all these pieces together â and for me thats pedestrian lowlevel storytelling that i would expect out of say the last two seasons of bsg or lost â â now i agree and i am with you on the deserters being a bunch of horrible people who do horrible things â i think that showing the depravity that can be letloose when the rules no longer apply when laws even customs are tossed aside in favor of the pure anarchy of strongest man makes the rules can create a type of barbarism and chaos â that i thought was fine â in fact i think it set the right tone the realms of man needs to defend itself not only from others and ww but from the type of anarchy â â but why involve bran other than because  well you gotta do something with himâ â its forced â contrived hamfisted storytelling â its lazy and lacks depth prospective and creativity â it turned a complex story into a story that relies on well whos in the general area its something i would expect from a network show â â but other than that it was fineâ"
"Bimmerella",2014-04-28,"i think we need to keep in mind that there are things that develop in the tv series that are organic and require adjustments by that i mean some of the brilliant performances by the actors that bring depth and interest to these characters that just didnt happen in the book brans arc at least for the show definitely needed to be altered a bit in order to make it more interesting for the tv screen im looking for some of the same for arya and jon then there are other unexpected performances that have become fan pets bronn davos grey worm pod the hound little finger varys as for the last scene of this episode im not feeling all butt hurt like some are i guess because as far as the others and the land of always winter we have had information about this through different stories so that we have had a clue about and this scene at the end is just a visual and it still leaves a ton of questions the tv only people dont have nearly as much of a clue about that last scene as we readers do all my friends that know ive read the books blew up my phone wanting clues"
"Jennelyn",2014-04-28,"i agree this was a really good episode i was gaping at the ending but honestly i like it when the show keeps me guessing when i think i know whats going to happen the ww scene was not a spoiler in my opinion this is nothing that has not been hinted at in the books the show just has a way of hitting us upside the head with it is all â i also am fine with jon snow going after the mutineers at crasters and i dont see sam telling jon about bran as being all that altering either i dont think he swore anything to bran on the show just the books i also dont think they will meet it seems more likely that they will just miss each other perhaps coldhands will finally make an entrance whatever happens well anticipate a meeting and be afraid of locke getting his grubby hands on bran but it wont quite happen â as for ghost i have no idea how they caught him and it did come out of nowhere but im interested to see whos throat he tears out when he gets free"

"Miodrag",2014-04-29,"well for one thing oberyn sex shows us how different dornish culture is to westerosi culture and this is consistent with the books and other dornish characters we will meet it also cements the passionate nature of oberyn and most of his kin their approach to multipartner relationships that could even be an important plot point should certain theories be true and this is just off the cuff id say it has at least as much right to exist as a useful scene as cersei and taena or in fact most of the written sex scenes in the show that arent bran catching the twins in the act â but all of that could be depicted through his dialogues with tyrion dornish culture emphasized by oberyns suggestion that myrcella can be crowned passionate nature of oberyn i think it was very obvious from the books even though he didnt have a single sex scene there  every word of his was passionate regardless of was he talking about his murdered sister or about whores with big tits and by the way the show didnt portray him as a passionate so much as a pervert also how many brothel scenes the show needs to portray oberyns relationship to his paramour â again its not about anyones rights to write or like whatever one wants but the fact is that cerseis powerobsessed lust is instrumental for both her character and the story in general that is undoubtedly influenced by her character actually her frustration at not being a man is possibly the one thing that started everything while on the other hand oberyns lust plays no part whatsoever hes described as lustful in the books and it does help with picturing him in readers head but its not instrumental for the depiction of his character â now i dont mean to say that only those aspects that are instrumental should be depicted in the show in the contrary the show is often devoid of that kind of little things that make the universe richer and more relatable but in hindsight it looks like the show allows only two kinds of those little things 1 how dangerous and wicked these people are and 2 how lustful they are and it does get boring in some other adaptation of asoiaf perhaps oberyns brothel adventures wouldnt be a problem at all but after three seasons of sex and gore tuned up to 11 it is quite another story"

they fucked that up so bad but say replacing roose at harrenhall with tywin made for a much more interesting dynamic between arya and her captor â â i agree with these pointsâ i also think that having tywin interface with arya was geniusâ why because it was done well and it fused together two compelling characters in a relatively creative way â â that cannot be confused with bran and jon â â but no more contrived than jon and his free folk just happening to cross paths with bran at that tower which does happen in the books â â but in the book and to a degree in the show itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a complete freak of nature that the two groups get so close â also the two sides never actually cross and are unaware of each other until very late in the game â and to me it sort of makes the second contrived crossing or nearcrossing even worse just how many times are these people â<U+0080><U+009C>almostâ<U+0080><U+009D> going to meet up because well they are sort of close â i find that specific device to be really  lame no pun intended â â and they are reallyâ<U+0080> not that closeâ jon himself says its 60 miles from castle black to crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>sâ i mean thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s the distance from berlin to dresden to say that somebody in berlin has a reasonable chance to run into somebody in dresden is pushing it and this is modern earth with transportation advances etc as far as where bran ended up he was at the nightfort the wall has like 20 towers all but three abandonedâ in a line from west to east nightfort would be 8 and castle black would be 11 in the middleâ so they are â<U+0080> closeish but hardly thatâ by clues given its been months since bran was at the wall â bran has a huge head start on jon â even if you factor in how hard it is for hodor to traverse the area carrying him thats a huge head start â if bran can do even a pedestrian 5 miles a day for two months  thats 300 miles â is jons horse a jet â â characters happening to cross paths realizing it or not is very common in the books its one of grrms favourite tricks â â yeah and if it annoyed me in the books i usually said soâ frankly i grow tired of the contrivance even in the booksâ see i am not a strict â<U+0080><U+009C>book puristâ<U+0080><U+009D> insofar as just because something was in the books does not mean i like itâ sometimes it worked brienne running into that fuckedup jester and killing him in affc the hound running into the ticklerâ sometimes its bad such as arya running into sam but then not saying anything or mormont running into tyrion in dwd and other times its fucking baffling arya running into one of her fatherâ<U+0080><U+0099>s men in sosâ<U+0080> who then decides â<U+0080><U+009C>no wait iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m a â<U+0080>kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s manâ<U+0080><U+0099> nowâ<U+0080>â<U+0080><U+009D> whatever the fuck that means â not everything in the books met my approval for whatever thats worth so if i didnt like something in the books chances are if the show improved on it i have said so â â all ill say to this is do you really want to bring up something lacking a sense of direction in a song of ice and fire do you reeeeeeally want to do that â â i think i doâ â because it annoys me both in the books and in the showâ the booksâ<U+0080> holy fuckballsâ<U+0080> dwd lacks directionâ affcâ<U+0080> lacks direction to put it mildlyâ and i have said soâ lack of direction has been killing this story forâ<U+0080> fuckâ<U+0080> 14 years nowâ<U+0080>â â i think youre overreacting i dont see how replacing the chapters of bran being cold hungry and day dreaming about meeras bum with him being captured by the mutineers which in the books were practically forgotten turns a complex story into a simple one â â i could be overreacting would not be the first timeâ â  but i respect martinâ<U+0080><U+0099>s dilemma one he has stated publicly many timesâ<U+0080><U+0093> he wrote bran too young and has no place to write himâ so he did the responsible thing he squirreled bran away iirc he has like 3 chapters in dwd so we donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have to pay attention to his â<U+0080><U+009C>educationâ<U+0080><U+009D> because it may be well like most educational experiences fucking boringâ soâ<U+0080> donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t show itâ â i know its extreme butâ<U+0080> maybe the show had to bite the bullet and stuff bran into a corner for 2 seasons and not really focus on him then come season 6 or 7 get a new actor to play bran hbo has done it in the past most notably with rome and game of thrones itself is on its 2nd tommen and 3rd mountain the show can handle that and have a reintroductionâ i think that may have workedâ â but to insert these small contrived forced stories are not helpingâ"

"Miodrag",2014-04-30,"i think that showsfilms are very rarely improvements over their source material thats the nature of an adaptation and i dont think game of thrones is any exception the show was also never really in a possession to be an improvement on the books theyre too vast there are too many characters too much action and too many ridiculously vast locations it would be virtually impossible to improve on them in a visual medium without unlimited time and money and an ageless cast none of which can be provided as to your second question i honestly dont know i think most book people would agree that some changes have been for the better and some for the worse which is true of basically every adaptation overall i do wish they would stick a little closer to the source material sometimes but i also wont get bitter about them wanting to put a bit of their own stamp into their adaptation i think theyve done a pretty impressive job with this show so far and it only appears to be getting prettier and better with age this season has been visually phenomenal thus far and we feel miles beyond the cramped spaces and general lack of setpiece moments and beautiful vistas from the first season its not a perfect show by any means but it is a generally good one â honestly im glad you arent defensive about the show like many showlovers tend to be which in turn makes them aggressive and rude even if you and i mostly disagree i have nothing but respect for you attitude unfortunately many showlover react angrily on the criticism of the show so i usually dont have the opportunity to say this but i do respect people who like the show for whatever reasons it should go without saying but i respect their opinion enough to debate it to challenge it just like i expect from them to challenge mine alas some of them just dont want to and instead they turn into personal attacks its as if the criticism endangers their love for the show and if thats really the case then their love is not so strong most probably no matter how loudly they proclaim it â that being said i respectfully disagree that the show is generally a good one id put it into the same category with lost the xfiles 24 homeland dexter meaning certainly watchable but far from masterpiece such products are always dependent on a personal taste if they satisfy the personal taste of a large number of viewers they are successful if not they arent but in my eyes thats not good enough especially if youre adapting the source material that already transcended the genre boundaries asoiaf is read and adored by numerous readers that arent big on fantasy im one of those it offers so much more than crazy action and various settings just like the sopranos caught the attention of many viewers that arent interested in mafia sagas and just like true detective attracted viewers that doesnt care about serial killers the author himself said he isnt interested in the genre at all and just like the wire is adored even by those viewers that dont particularly like cop dramas thats what i think an adaptation of asoiaf should be and even better because honestly no story of this strength and quality ever hit the screens not by a large margin if your ambition is to create the best tv show ever then asoiaf is the source material from your dreams and the best part is the audience would love it no need for those some things dont look so good on screen excuses i hear all the time the budget can be limiting of course but some often cited adaptation rules arent even if you take all the notscreenfriendly stuff out of asoiaf youre still left with more than enough for a tv show that would end tv shows and im pretty sure a lot of stuff that people like to peg as inappropriate for screens is actually very screenfriendly and definitely more screenfriendly than many of the changes we saw as i said in some other thread aryas harrenhal days are very cinematic much more so than what we got in the show her conversation with roose is certainly not a bit less cinematic than her tv conversations with tywin and its much more important for the narrative and themes â so i cant put got into the same category with the sopranos the wire and true detective in fact were having this conversation only because of the books without them i dont think id watch the show after the second season cant be sure of course but based on my experience with other shows id quit after so much subpar writing in that season thats about the quality as for the faithfulness im honestly surprised when people say the show is faithful to the books it simply isnt ever since the first season you have like 34 scenes taken from the books per episode the rest is either heavily changed or completely invented not to mention how many iconic lines they cut even in the first season all in all probably more than the half of show time is authentic tv material whatever this adaptation is it isnt faithful and the reason for that is not money nor time nor what works on screen rules but what you rightfully recognize dds desire to put a bit of their own stamp but there we also disagree because i strongly dislike the way theyre putting their stamp here there are other ways to do the same cogman managed to do it in his episode in season 2 with theons burning the letter scene and with tyrions trick on pycelle varys and littlefinger  he adapted the stuff from the book into something more suited for tv but he preserved the tone and the spirit of the book thats what smart adapting

"SoManyVows",2014-04-29,"i would like to see bran and jon reunite even if its only for a brief moment at the absolute least i would like them to catch a glimpse of one another before bran escapes into the woods the possibility certainly exists for the show to repeat the queenscrown scenario once again but i except that jon openly wondering if bran might make his way to crasters keep was foreshadowing their eventual encounter some people here are upset that sam told jon that bran is alive and traveling beyond the wall even though bran never made sam promise not to tell jon im happy with it because i believe that the writers made this change for a reason â obviously bran being captured by the mutineers serves primarily as a way to inject some drama and a sense of danger into his storyline  otherwise he wouldnt have anything to do until the finale but say all thats happens is that jons attack inadvertently provides the distraction that bran and the reeds need to escape and the two of them never cross paths then from a storytelling perspective it actually works better if jon doesnt know that bran is beyond the wall because it plays into the tragedy of the unknown once again these characters were so close and yet so far from one anotherâ jon knowing about bran and unknowingly heading to the very place where his brother is being held captive creates a set of expectations that viewers justly or not will be expecting the show to meet the nearmiss at queenscrown can be explained away as a coincidence as it was in the book this convergence is being constructed by the writers specifically for the show and i expect that it will pay off â i also think that the show has to be careful here lest this particular trope becomes a running joke which it already kind of is  the starks havent really been dealt a good hand by this world benioff and weiss have already employed the soclosebutyetsofar device twice when it comes to potential stark family reunions the aforementioned queenscrown and arya at the red wedding theyre also setting up yet another potential convergence with sansa and arya at the vale and we know for certain that one isnt going to come to fruition but all of those nearmisses are lifted directly from the book this is new material and theyve set up several clues that lead me to believe that this particular encounter is going to play out differently â locke is the key to this i think hes an original character for the show and hes currently been tasked by roose bolton to find the stark boys and kill them well this is his chance he knows that bran is beyond the wall because he overheard jons conversation with sam  its the reason that he volunteered to go with jon in the first place even if jon doesnt encounter bran locke has to because otherwise what was the purpose of sending him to the wall rickon isnt there and jon is a secondary priority for the boltons because he isnt considered legitimate isâ the show just going to discard the entire sense of menace that theyve cultivated around locke have him forget his original mission and decide to join the nights watch for real that seems highly unlikely â if locke discovers that bran is a captive at crasters keep during the attack as seems likely then he will have to make his move right then and there because he might never get another chance to kill the boy then hell have to be dealt with and who is going to kill him meera summer bran by warging into hodor why not jon hell be initially preoccupied with leading the attack but if and when he realizes lockes true purpose then i have to assume that hell drop everything else to save his brother so during the chaos of the battle locke finds bran hes about to kill him when jon intervenes the two duel and jon kills locke he then shares a moment with his brother â i think that this could actually turn out to be a very sweet and effective scene jon talks to bran after saving him and begs him to return with him to the relative safety of the wall so that jon can protect him he wasnt able to help ned or robb but he can help bran and thats important bran can explain the necessity of his journey and in doing so remind jon of the duty that he has to uphold  the new set of brothers that he has to protect eventually jon reluctantly allows bran to go on and the two of them reaffirm their brotherly love for one another and their hopes that the stark family will be whole again one day things are pretty much pitch black right now but this would offer up just a glimmer of hope a candle in the darkness â such a scene would provide a nice sense of closure as the characters return to their own separate storylines i hope that we get to see it edited by somanyvows 29 april 2014  1238 pm"

"Ironclaw",2014-04-29,"imo and i repeat imo i do not want there to be a bj rendezvous lol in the near future there is good chance chance but little need for brans company to meet with jon for as many have stated for plot reasons the show has obviously deviated from the books giving away unconfirmed theories about the novels lf and qot involvement in the death of kj and glimpses towards things we have yet to see in the novels the reveal of the others stronghold of you wanna call it that and a reveal of what is really done with crasters boys then theres the deviations from the novels with character story lines theres so many examples i dont even want to start on those examples however all these minor plot changes have not so far changed the fabric of the story so far however the sandorarya plot change irked me for reasons involving their character relationship however thats not what we are here to discuss my reason for not wanting and not believing that bran company and jon will meet is simple it will significantly shape how the plot of the story goes there is a reason that none of the starks have met it drives the plot of other characters significantly throughout the rest of the novel and will change the course of how essential plots unfold the biggest book betrayal the show has done so far imo is of sam telling jon of his bran encounter jon knows the dangers beyond the wall and has love for bran book jon would have rode north all day to rescue bran because a he can ride beyond north of the wall and would not let bran go by himself thus forever changing jons destiny as lc but if you look at jon and bran company meeting it will utterly destroy the book plot and kill a major burning question for all the readers what is jons true parentage i think this setup is an obvious ploy to get asoiaf readers to be put on the edge of their seats its the question most readers have and to keep us interested you need to have us fearfulbegging of the possibility of that reveal and how it will shape the show obviously db and dw know jons true parentage most of us believe the r  l j for good reason but jon running into the reeds and bran will change how jon transforms and betray who his character is if he lets them ride north without him and the knowledge they may or may not have about his parentage would be given away by a run in that would ruin something grrm would wanna reveal himself and not be casually dropped into a midseason episode too early on in the progression of the story it really should be nothing more than a tease if it leads to more than that it will severely ruin the integrity of the story the novels tell as a whole they may switch things up in the show but i dont believe they will diverge onto a different road completely"

sam and hasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t been out since before the mutinyâ a stretch i know but it is an explanationâ karl sees value in keeping ghost around since a giant direwolf would be a good weapon against the othersâ the trap that summer fell into wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t necessarily for another direwolf â plus bran was in summerâ<U+0080><U+0099>s mind when summer hit the trap so that is technically branâ<U+0080><U+0099>s carelessnessâ â what made me say â<U+0080><U+009C>wtfâ<U+0080><U+009D> was when karl hinted towards a ransomâ to whoâ â on the nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s king â thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s no indication the white walker went as far as the land of always winter with the babyâ north of the wall encompasses a huge area as george rr martin says â<U+0080><U+009C>probably the size of canadaâ itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s possible he went somewhere much closer the frost fangs for example still a good ways from crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s but not nearly as far as the land of always winter and the white walkers could have several hangoutsâ plus as others have pointed out the white walkers were really gentle and careful with the babyâ itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s possible the white walker fed it and kept it alive for a four or five day journeyâ they could have ridden non stop too cutting the journey to two or three days â â on top of that the fist of the first men in the books is actually in the middle the haunted forestâ there would be trees close to it in the show it wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t portrayed as such so the geography beyond the wall could be quite differentâ more barren and covered in snow so crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s keep could be closer to the edge of the haunted forest rather than in the middle of itâ again not an excellent explanation but itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s something â â on margaery â margaery is the same game player we saw in season two but she just may not be as crafty as we originally thoughtâ what do i mean by thatâ thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a difference between being crafty enough to know renly and loras were doing it as if it was a secret anyway and knowing that your grandmother was plotting to kill joffreyâ margaery as manipulative as she is she still in her third season doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t seem overly evil or genius â â she wants powerâ opportunity in the storm lands pointed towards marrying her brotherâ<U+0080><U+0099>s lover who happened to be a kingâ when littlefinger was there and it became possible to be betrothed to the bachelor king in the capital she jumped on that opportunityâ she will do whatever it takes if it means putting up with a husband who likes men or trying to appeal to a psycho and make the best of itâ renly wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t a real king and she wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t really in any position to rule as queen anyway when joffrey died and the marriage wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t consummated she didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have any reason to assume she would just be marrying his younger brother â â iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m rambling a little i guess iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m saying i disagree with the idea that margaery has been portrayed as dumbing down from season to seasonâ i think everything sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s done has been consistent with her season 2 and 3 portrayalâ as far as getting into tommenâ<U+0080><U+0099>s room her family is allied with the guy who knows every secret passageway in kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s landing varysâ she didnt necessarily have to get past the guards â â on latin text in mereen â i imagine the masters spoke the common tongue and it seems plausible the text was written in the common tongue to further taunt them before they were killedâ they know dany was waiting outside their gates but showing that the idea of rebellion had crept inside their wallsâ thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s an â<U+0080><U+009C>oh shitâ<U+0080><U+009D> momentâ the slaves didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t necessarily have to read it it was meant to be seen by the masters i think â â locke stormlands overhearing sam and jon â he said he was a game warden in the storm lands not that he was from thereâ being raised in winterfell and being a bastard too i doubt jon had too much interaction with northerners who werenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t his own family people of winterfellâ even if he did they were probably highborn something locke is notâ maybe he didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know the accents definitively enough to differentiate a northern lowborn from any other low bornâ the wallâ<U+0080><U+0099>s full of low borns from all over westeros i imagine itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a challenge to keep accents straight anywayâ â all locke would have found out from overhearing jon and sam is that bran and rickon were not at the wall which he probably had figured out alreadyâ he knew from ramsay that bran and rickon were alive â on sam breaking his oath â by this season jon has learned â ghost is potentially dead his brother robb is dead the old bear is dead his sisters are probably dead edmure spent his wedding night in a dungeon and alliser thorne is acting lord commander of the nights watch â i imagine sam would have probably told jon about bran and rickon being alive just so he could have some optimism â edited by younggriff89 29 april 2014  0332 pm"

"Khal-a-bunga",2014-04-30,"theres a thread over at imdb not too dissimilar to the unsullied thread in the general forum where they are laughing their asses off at the absurdity of the hate and the ridiculousness of many of the complaints bandied about at this forum specifically the nitpick thread and all i could think about when i saw it was the posters atâ imdb of all places are laughing about these posts â craziness besides so much of the hate seems to be due to this kind of cognitive dissonance where people just cant seem to separate the show from the book series which leads to complaints being leveled against the show that simply dont make sense in the context of the show itself its understandable i guess but its becoming pointless to even hang around this forum if youre looking to have good interesting conversations about the show in general and even as an adaptation some of the complaints are just soâ stupid my main reason for posting anymore is simply to read and speculate on whats going to happen with the show going forwardâ â whatever â ontopic loved the directing during the scene between tommen and margaery the lighting gave it a very fireandice visual palette â among a number of other things about the episodeâ"

"Bear Island",2014-04-28,"at first i thought that it was likely they would just miss crossing paths like they did earlier in the story however with summer trapped and hodor shackled that kind of eliminates the possibility of bran warging them to kill off the mutineers so they can leave before jon arrives i have a kind of crackpot theory that coldhands will show up and free them and theyll leave together with all of the mutineers dead just before jon and his party arrivethat way coldhands could be introduced and jon wouldnt have to know bran was still alive which preserves the stannis plot i cant help but think that if dd are happy to change the timeline significantly it means they have an endgame in mind and they know what sideplots will and will not figure into the bigger picture that said they do seem to like neglecting stannis so it wouldnt shock me if they massively change this so davos can head off on the quest to find rickon sooner and they can cut out the jon stark bargaining chip i suppose its not such a huge plot point since jon rejects the offer edited by bear island 28 april 2014  0315 am"

"Ser Oromus Locke",2014-04-28,"the formost complaint i have with these changes is that sam shouldnt have told jon it felt like we missed a very very important scene and then the others what the twowspoilers not to mention completely unnecessary â sam not telling jon was something that always angered me in the books the guys sams best friend and in all likelihood saved his life besides all that hes jons brother he has a right to know â the fact that sam is willing to so blindly trust cold hands in the novel never made sense to me it seemed to be something simply done for plot convenience â uhm because coldhands saved sams life when he and gilly were surrounded by wights in whitetree led them safely to a secret passageway under the wall known to men of the nights watch only â its pretty darn hard to not trust a guy after he magically appeared out of nothing on an elk and saved your chickbaby life and led you back to safety through a gate that only your sworn brothers know about  indicating that he at least once was a sworn brother â except grrm writes 10 of the episodes â so basically 1 episode of a 10 episode season which was the second episode this season â ok my turn to complain first of all i need to say that im not a book purist nerdi understand that book adaptations on screen need some changes or else they would have been rather boring in most cases â now in order to take things from the beginningwhen theon told about the starks being alive i thought this would have lead to a rickonosha chasewe never learned how rick ended in the cannibals isle and it could have been a fine addition â no people having the starks reunite is not coolthe series is not some fairy tale where in the end everyone lives happily ever afteri dont think i wanna see a cliche reunion where some typical emotion will kick inalso as someone else mentioned the alternative of having repeatedly almost there reunion scenes will also lead to opposite results for the viewers â as for the stanis offer thing i dont think the knowledge of bran being alive changes that muchbut it does change in terms of who jon snow has becomethe belief that all his family are dead has played a significant role to the shaping of his characterand when he learns about arya he goes from one mistake to the next since hes desperate to secure his only sistera jon snow who knows that at least 3 of his brotherssisters are alive is a completely different person and his story becomes far less dramatic â as for lrj that some people mentioned i dont think that martin would have let the show writers spoil his upcoming book like thatmost probably only the final season will be a huge spoiler for the readers since its impossible that martin will have finished the seventh book by than finally i must say that the final scene with the others was nice since we got some insight about them never mentioned before â osha is a wildling and skagos is probably more akin to wildling culture then anything else in the north â but grrm keeps pulling on those almost theremeetings arya wants to go to her family too bad your family just died jaime returns to kl too bad your kid just died brienne is looking for sansa too bad a hedge kniggit you met up with on your travels that was also looking for sansa but whom you snuck away from because he was a bit shady got to her first and doesnt even realize who she is jaime is in the riverlands and brienne tells him that she has found sansa in the hounds captivity but needs him for something too bad thats a bwbambush â at this point its completely fabricated that all of aryas hitlistees suddenly appear right in front of her the whole damn time because whenever somebody is actively looking for somebody else they find them either dead or they die themselves  â as for lrj i think the reeds are either dead and should only come back into play later when bran gets the heck out of that cave somehow â but who cares dropping the branrickon is alivebomb so casually is just about as bad in my eyes very vastly changes who jon snow is i mean his conversation with mel changes completely i dont have a sister very much inspired by living with the guilt of knowing of all the losses in his family the following rescue mission is a direct consequence of that but were now getting it with bran instead so are we going to get it with both bran and farya as thorne acknowledges this mission is clearly with the nws survival in mind so jon gets away with it on d very bad terms though but the faryamission isnt which leads to well you know â theres this weird thought in my mind thinking though that theyre condensing this plot with a future plotline in which jon does find bran jon is revived somehow and leads the ranging towards hardhome for some reason i expect that bran at that point has left the cave or that the underwater river ends up in hardhome leading to jon and bran meeting up at hardhome with bran having one final message from jojen jon youre not my brother youre my cousin â so here is to hoping that bran will get out before actually meeting with jon where are you coldhands or more realistically warg into hodor and free them and wolves in the chaos that will happen when jon will attack crasters keep â also my hope for this season that locke gets killed not by jon but by direwolf jon will have his fill of â killing and fighting scenes at the end of season time for the wolves i started to hope about thisâ from the moment roose sent locke after stark boys i was hoping hell go after osha and rickon and shaggydog will get them but i will take summer andor ghost action anytime now â pretty much agree with the first part i snipped so i got nothing to add to that â the only thing that i liked from these scenes in the episode is that it couldve explained why ghost took so long to get back warging into hodor seems like the most obvious choice for dd at this point and i think they alluded to it with hodor being picketed in the scene in which they were caught he looked even more helpless then normal and what better way to break out then to use that surprise factor â i want to see hodor take a blade and smack it through lockes skull while both summer and ghost are tearing at his arms the only problem is why should the wolf get revenge for the lion symbolical sorry for catelyn holding tyrion accused for the assassination attempt â also i still dont enjoy locke why couldnt we have vargo hoat but i guess this will work i like the goatee though xd edited by ser oromus locke 28 april 2014

"Dorne Sand",2014-04-30,"â how can they botch up a story that grrm himself is producing and helping to write â surely he would have been like oh wait that would screw it all up if you did that â they arent botching the story they are making the changes necessary to bring it to screen grrm is no god i liked the wall arc and what goes beyond just as it was in the book i fully agree with botched comment that changes has to be done ok but i just dont like the changes theyhe made and i think even for a tv show they are badly made it begun in the previous episode with sam sending gilly to moles town when he knows that they are wildlings on the wrong side of the wall to say the next episode oh shit  they are wildlings on the wrong side of the wall attacking villages and gilly is now in danger the casual oh by the way one of you brother is alive the training in the yard stopped by allister without any mention of how that could be usefull against armed wildlings oh by the way i dont see any kind of preparation of a fight coming on castle blackâ and the excuse of allister to send john away is very lame while the danger is very much present and that they mention the obvious lack of men to defend it oh and look what a coincidence just when john will attack the mutiners in crasters the same that kept his wolf alive for what the hell reason his wolf that apparently in all previous episodes he dont give a fig about just then bran is captured by the same mutiners who has set up a trap for some strange reason trap in which haha summer falls in and now look they are captured â as if they didnt have a guy that had green dreams travelling with them â up until now i didnt mind any of the changes some even i found great â not this is it about ressources no the changes they made imply more action than needed about time no the sam gilly part is absurd as the crasters scene could have saved some precious time on the contrary they needed to show the characters and needed some action to do so well personally i think it is wrong i loved low paced show with a lot of dialogues in just like true detective or the wire for instance what the hell you are bringing to screen a 10000 thousand pages book surely you cant need to add plots that are not there and i dont speak about scenes but full plots â â could we have some beautifully written dialogues involving sam john aemon some dialogues where we could have felt the missed wolf and sam telling john about bran if you need him to know for any reason at all couldnt we have built up the tension on the wall with john and allister arguing about the defenses of castle black for exemple or made the watch pardon to john going wildling longuer  any other plot with more sense and logic a plot where just as they made with jaime showed us some character insigths and changes â i dont know where they are going but since the former episode i didnt understand and really i understand less and less i always looked at the bran arc north of the wall as some kind of homage to frodon trip a lonely trip yes boring but poetic on his own with the always present and creepy feeling of someone travelling to his own doom the johns arc was one of my favorite with his guilt about being a double turncloack his rise in the watch etc etc â and worst of all i dont see any kind of benefit for the changes they made even on a tv show adaptation necessity side they added complexity where the book is straigth forward they added incoherent plots and moves that even without reading the book seem stupid and some non reader i know just found this episode plainly boring â"

"Tixu Oty",2014-05-03,"it seems like a really long ride from crasters to wherever one would expect the hq of the white walkers to beâ presumably its in the lands of always winter hundreds of miles from crasters across a forbidding mountain rangeâ even if we stipulate the ww have magic dont get frostbite powers with their affinity to cold a baby would die of dehydration and starvation before reaching itâ unless wws can also nurse newborns â im glad someone brought that up i was thinking the exact same thing â it looksâ like things are being set up for the mutineers to use bran against jon â i can live with that im also eager to see where this goes â he probably will tell him cuts out the whole wex pyke thing stannis can just send davos to pick him up saves time introducing the manderlysdavos being killed etc they can be brought in some other way â stannis offers jon winterfell but jon refuses saying rickon is still aliveâ so stannis sends davos after rickon davos looks for him at white harbor seeing as house manderly is loyal to the starksand wyman gives him the leads towards finding him on skagos he also talks about some northern vengeance â yes i suppose they could do that if so i sure hope they find ways to make it super interesting because the whole davos and manderly thing was one of my favorite moments in affcadwd it works if jon has no idea where rickon is he could advise that stannis try to hook up with manderly who is loyal and has boats two birds with one stone with rickon being a side mission but theres no way manderly would send davos to skagos in the show since tv rickon is headed for last hearth and if manderly plays his part in a convincing way the umbers would not trust him with that information i think â karl reminds me of some of the more redneck types ive met down here in the southâ i think a person like karl might just get a huge ego boost knowing he now has a big ferocious direwolf to call his own â youre right i think no further explanation is needed really â now jon snow knows something thats ddlevel character assassination â aha â yea its like if you are going to make a major change like this dont we at least deserve to see an emotional scene where jon finds out his brother wasnt murdered by his foster brother â except jon didnt get that memo to start with and neither did robb and cat in the show â if that is the case dd will be eliminating yet another great stannis line who better to command the black cloaks than a man who once commanded the gold sire any of you i would think even the cook but who am i kidding showstannis has zero sense of humor and dd go out of their way to make him as unlikeable as humanly possibleâ nah theyll keep that in id say theyve already reminded us of where slynt came from and established that thorne isnt liked by the men which sets slynt up to be the compromise candidate to oppose jon which leads into that quote â it would go along with the raid the pantry line which was perfectly in line with the sardonic humour of stannisâ â i agree no reason to assume that will be changed just yet â now in order to take things from the beginningwhen theon told about the starks being alive i thought this would have lead to a rickonosha chasewe never learned how rick ended in the cannibals isle and it could have been a fine addition â no people having the starks reunite is not coolthe series is not some fairy tale where in the end everyone lives happily ever afteri dont think i wanna see a cliche reunion where some typical emotion will kick inalso as someone else mentioned the alternative of having repeatedly almost there reunion scenes will also lead to opposite results for the viewers as for the stanis offer thing i dont think the knowledge of bran being alive changes that muchbut it does change in terms of who jon snow has becomethe belief that all his family are dead has played a significant role to the shaping of his characterand when he learns about arya he goes from one mistake to the next since hes desperate to secure his only sistera jon snow who knows that at least 3 of his brotherssisters are alive is a completely different person and his story becomes far less dramatic â i have two things to say about that first im like you i liked the tragic aspect of jon not knowing all his siblings but robb were really alive i even liked that he could have figured it out with his wolf dreams but he had other problems on his plate and just like the other stark kids we never really get much of his thoughts about the loss of his family however i think its ok to cut back on this for the show only people some of these could definitely deal with just a little bit more of hope and good things for the good people in this show i believe its also part of what keeps people watching sure it aint becoming a fairytale but no need to go all out gloom either â the second thing i want to see and it occured to me while reading this thread is that theon has been whitewashed in a way in the show we really dont know to what extent the false information that he killed the stark boys has been spread robb and cat never heard that story and if jon hasnt heard it maybe not so many people believe that correct me if im wrong my memory might be failing me there but have we ever heard someone say that theon killed the stark boys i really cant remember if not then maybe the reason for that is the show wants to make a future redemption easier for theon maybe theon ends up meeting jon snow and the show needs jon not to be super mad at theon at this time i really dont know â i dont know if anyones suggested this yet on this thread but i think its possible that if bran escapes ck before jon and co arrive that karl could justâ lie to jon and say he killed bran just to be a spiteful prick this would put everything back to how it is in the books and would actually make jon feel even shittier about his brothers supposed death â hey that could definitely work for me it would be a bit repetitive to have another nearmiss if you ask me but then again it could serve to put the blame for brans supposed death on somebody else than theon â it has been mentioned but i think thats the best possible outcomeâ i really really dont want bran and jon to meet at this pointâ if anything i would find it satisfying if jojen sensed or had a vision of jons warging abilitiesâ as ive said before given that jon and ghost were separated by the wall at queenscrown and jons link with his direwolf was severed at least in the books jojens ability to sense another warg in the stark family was probably hamperedâ alternatively the greenseer3ec wasnt concerned with pointing out brans familys abilities to jojen but i like the idea of jojen sussing

"Chebyshov",2014-04-29,"the other thing about that quote is that sophie turner describes the sansatyrion relationship as one of the most important in got thats a pretty tall order considering how many relationships there are in got and it also seems at odds with what weve seen of the books to date where sansa and tyrions relationship is not particularly important to them let alone the narrative very curious where thats goingâ exactly in the books tyrion represents everything that sansa has come to hate the lannisters and doesnt place much significance on the marriage in post she dreams of him often but replaces him with the hound in almost every situation so its hard to argue that tyrion himself had any lasting impact she does think of him as kind at times but given the men shes generally around i think this may have been faint praiseâ â â<U+0080><U+009C>yesâ<U+0080><U+009D> sansa knew the truth of her flowering could not be long hidden in the eyrieâ â<U+0080><U+009C>tyrion didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t    he never    â<U+0080><U+009D> she could feel the blush creeping up her cheeks â<U+0080><U+009C>i amstill a maidâ<U+0080><U+009D>â â<U+0080><U+009C>was the dwarf incapableâ<U+0080><U+009D>â â<U+0080><U+009C>no he was only    he was    â<U+0080><U+009D> kind she could not say that not here not to this auntwho hated him so â<U+0080><U+009C>he    he had whores my lady he told me soâ<U+0080><U+009D>â however sophie seems to be hinting that sansa may come to trust tyrion which would have significant consequences leading forward im â very curious to see if and how she talks about tyrion to lysa we might get something a bit deeper than her i never wanted to marry him that we get in the books edited by chebyshov 29 april 2014  0124 pm"

"Woman of War",2014-04-29,"it is interesting to note that sansa is not afraid at all of baelish since she rather bluntly threw accusations marked as questions into his face there is no facial body language or verbal restrainment towards him compared to being at court before only tyrion got hbo sansas contrary to book sansa honest emotions of sadness and fury so much more dignified than the mousy silence in the books but then sophie turners sansa is much more mature than book sansa and see quotes above tyrion is the one she trusts so far not to betray her does she trust baelish not to harm her does baelish please his own sense of grandeur by sharing his awesomeness with sansa seeing her as powerless and yet she feels safe enough to be sharp towards him maybe showmakers dont want to make it easy for baelish to draw her on his side dont want to present her as naive any longer when she asked the right questions a true task for baelish not an easy prey they may keep it open for a while if sansa will side with lf nothing is spoiled so far since it is very much open in the books as well but this sansa wont stumble naively into baelishs traps she may make conscious decisions to side with him or not so she may follow baelishs plans in whatever way and become a killer or hbo sansa may truly become an active sherlock find out some things and be the end of baelish revenge served cold"

"Newstar",2014-04-29,"woman of war i noticed sansa being blunt and pointed with lf as well although she was still somewhat guarded she didnt shrug off lf when he ran his hand down her arm although she was clearly uncomfortable lf is also much more openly creepy and handsy with sansa than he was at this point in the books i didnt think they would do the lfsansa kiss but after the most recent episodes i think a kiss would hardly be shocking one thing id forgotten is that sophie turner usually misses two or three episodes a season 4x09 is out but its probably a safe bet that shes appearing in 4x10 and 4x07 if she sits out 4x06 then 4x07 seems a very unlikely candidate for only cat i agree the only thing about putting only cat in the finale is that i think that the snow scene has to be in the same episode as the confrontation with lysa and that seems like a lot for an episode thats going to be crammed to the gills with other things on the other hand if not 4x10 where would it go edited by newstar 29 april 2014  0207 pm"

"TeamLemonCakeBraavos",2014-04-30,"the writers have known the characters final plot resolutions from the beginning even if they only recently got more details so i really dont see why you would suddenly see this as them writing endgame sansa or endgame anybodyâ as for her being more distant from baelish given that the tv baelish never acts like a creepy sociopath nonstop whereas the book version is meant to be charming if also a bit unsettling to her the difference in attitudes is kind of necessary â id actually say this is more of a problem since the plot requires sansa to be taken in by this guy to a considerable extent going forward â i thought the producers recently sat down with grrm and went into depth about what happens with each character regardless the reason i think they would be wring endgame sansa now as opposed to before is because they had a lot more material to work with before they still had 3 booksand 3 chapters of affcto go through they dont have that anymore theyre vastly approaching the end of her chapters in the books so if theyre going to take her somewhere theyd best start setting her up for it now which i think is exactly what theyre doing"

"Annara Snow",2014-04-30,"i dont understand how sansa isnt dying her hair has lead to the conclusion sansa will not be hiding her identity the latter makes no sense at all and would torpedo every storyline she has from now on for at least a season and a half if not more â the former really isnt a big deal that some book fans make it out to be in the book it wasnt some incredible disguiseâ i just thought that the reasoning was petyr baelishs dark haired bastard daughter appears at the same time that sansa goes missing would be a tiny bit less suspicious than petyr baelishs auburn haired bastard daughter appears at the same time sansa goes missing however the unsullied wont be wondering why she isnt dying her hair  i dont think its been established how good if any hair dye exists inuniverse and there can be other reasons not to do it inuniverse dark hair may not look convincingly natural on her blonde makes little sense since it would make her look even less like her father she may run out of hair dye or someone may notice the roots showing  and a bastard daughter with dyed hair would look more suspicious than ginger bastard daughter and if its supposed to be a tully trait would anyone be surprised that lf went for a woman with similar hair colour to cat tyrion never tried to dye his hair or otherwise change his appearance to pass as yollohugor and he should be far more recognizable than sansa especially in the books im sure that there are many more maids of three and ten or around that age auburn hair blue eyes beautiful than there are incredibly ugly dwarfs with eyes of different hair colors and half a nose missing â â  which may be one of the reasons theyre dropping it in the show sophie is a natural blonde so dark hair may not look convincing on her which may also be why her hair is lighter than michellescatelyns in the first place in addition to that the show is not known for overestimating its audience and their ability to keep track of characters oshaashayara robertrobin and maybe theyre right if its actually true that there are quite a few casual viewers who know sansa as ginger stark â true chebyshov but he did nothing came only well after lf explained that tyrion in fact did nothing it was hardly something that she just knew i wouldnt think that much of it were it not for this quote from a spanish language magazine interview with sophie turner the april issue i think where sophie turner says the following when asked about the influence of tyrion and sansas relationship on sansa translated from spanish cutting out some stuff about joffrey tyrion is her only and true friend hes the only one whos been honest with her well she has shae but shaes not completely sincere with sansa she could trust tyrion completely if she wished to its one of the most important relationships in game of thrones especially for my character i didnt think that much of it at the time blah blah blah whitewashing but after 4x04 and alex graves recent revelation that he is spoiled for postadwd books and spoils the actors so that they know how to act in certain scenes im starting to wonder about the possibilities for sansa and tyrion becoming platonic to be clear allies in the future postadwd the hbo viewers guide talking all about tyrion treating sansa with the utmost respect could be whitewashing or it could be setting something up down the line for a reasonably amicable alliance â there are three possibilities for that quote â 1 its been wrongly translated 2 sophie was misquoted in the article 3 sophie didnt express herself well â i can see her saying that its one of the most important relationships for sansa but one of the most important relationships in got as a whole that makes no sense from anything seen in the books or in the show  especially considering the fact that it also goes against everything shes said in every other interview just going by her interviews shes singled out margaery not tyrion as her biggest influence in kl in becoming a player tyrion got mentioned but only as one of the people in kl she observed and soaked things from together with cersei and margaery and shes also categorically ruled out the possibility of sansa developing any genuine romantic interest in tyrion in every interview and made a face to express how she or sansa feels about the marriage in general so how exactly would tyrion become the most important relationship in her story trumping her parents her siblings anyone she has or will have romantic interest in littlefinger joffrey cersei sweetrobin anyone else she will get to interact while shes in vale in near future or how is sansa going to become the most important or one of the most important relationships in tyrions story trumping tywin cersei jaime tysha shae anyone he does or will interact in essos especially since they arent even likely to meet again until late in winds of winterâ even in the unlikely outcome that they end up ruling westeros together that still wouldnt be the case â regarding the differences between sansas behavior to lftyrion i think its most likely the result of the following â 1 the show being generally less subtle than the books and making everything more obvious unless theyre completely ignoring it because of the lack of internal monologue  so instead of hinting that sansa does not trust lf and does not hate tyrion they do their best to hammer it home 2 lf being a lot more obviously creepy and villainous in the show see point 1 3 tyrion being portrayed as a much nicer guy and having treated sansa better than he did in the book 4 the shows attempts to minimize every conflict between the good guys as colonel green pointed out  therefore in order to make sure the audience likes sansa the logic goes it has to be spelled out that she trusts the shows good guy and distrusts the shows bad guy â there is nothing in the books that prevents sansa and tyrion from forming an amicable alliance down the line whenever they see each other again without the context of sansa being in lannister hands and forced into marriage with him  they dont hate each other and even their negative thoughts about each other are very mild therefore changes really arent necessary to make that work especially if were assuming that the show is being faithful to georges synopsis he gave dd if george thinks that the characters could conceivably form amicable relations the way theyve been so far i dont see why they would have to be changed for the show to make the exact same thing possible edited by annara snow 30 april 2014

"Annara Snow",2014-05-01,"while im no tyrionsansa shipper i think that the ambivalent nature of their relationship is going to be really important later for good or ill so yeah i seriously agree with you here for onceâ sophie is saying sansa could have trusted tyrion and even found common ground with him if she wanted to but she didnt and really can anyone blame sansa my mum doesnt astute viewers dontâ i think sophie turner came a little close to severe spoiler country with that quote because its really hinting that there could be some sort of interaction with sansa and tyrion later on and im really thinking it has nothing to do with romanceâ and that would make sansa and tyrion one of the most important relationships in got overall how exactly it could make it one of the most important relationships for sansa but not one of the most important overall which would imply its the single most important relationship in her life and the most or one of the couple of most important in tyrions i dont doubt that there will be interaction between them but how would that make it one of the most important relationships in the series unless they are two heads of the dragon or azor again reborn and nissa nissa or something equally unlikely â â or sansa could eventually escape into the vale and encounter the barbarian tribes shagga likes axes and her status as tyrions wife might prove helpful in getting their helpprotection â â and again how would that make sansatyrion one of the most important relationships in got its not even about him just her status as his legal wife edited by annara snow 01 may 2014  0751 am"

"Annara Snow",2014-05-01,"director alex graves mentioned in a recent interview  see httpwwwhitfixcofreyswedding2  that he told a number of actors what would happen to their character in later seasons he in turn picked this up from david andor dan because he felt it would affect how certain scenes should be acted andor directed so allthough we dont know if sophie turner is one of those who was told certain info about later developments its a possibility to keep in mindâ â one possible reason why this could turn into a very important relationship  and why dd have made sure tyrion was quite a bit nicer than he was in the books  is that they remain married maybe for political reasons as i could see tyrion being in a position to be danys andor jons heir in the end since martin also wrote the marriage between the durrandon heir and orys baratheon which came to be in even worse circumstances for the unwilling bride it wouldnt be impossible for him to intend thatâ â â â how â the only thing that tyrion can be the heir to is casterly rock â as for sansa and tyrion remaining married for political reasons i can only see them remaining married ie officially but not really  and only for a while because its convenient for sansa to be unable to marry anyone else as long as she doesnt have to live with and have sex with tyrion but in the long run if she wants to be a political force a marriage to tyrion lannister has no advantages for sansa and only has disadvantages the north and the riverlands are never going to accept her if she is married to a lannister â  as for the idea that they could actually be married and live as husband and wife for political reasons thats completely out of the question imo it goes against everything in sansas arc and everything in tyrions arc sansas arc has shown her being disillusioned with arranged marriages and people wanting her for her claim slowly starting to develop an acceptance of nonconventional behavior bastards women who have sexual relationships outside of marriage like ellaria or mya and generally changing her views on social conventions as well as developing her sexuality which in the books where we are in her head has been focusing on a completely socially inappropriate object of desire who would not be a suitable husband for a highborn lady in any way and the theme of sexual agency  and being denied it by others  are very prominent in her arc deciding to be a good wife in a political marriage would not fit with her character development deciding to be a good wife in a political marriage that she was forced into by her captors not gonna happen â yes grrm wrote a story where a girl ended up falling in love with a man she was forced to marry  but 1 that was the start of danys story and the beginning of her journey from powerlessness to power and ended up with dany being widowed hatching dragons and becoming a powerful queen  in book 1 rather than the ending of danys story 2 the fact that theres one story of one of the main female characters ending up falling in love with a man she was forced to marry is an additional reason why it wont happen with another female character aside from grrm making sure to show that this female character sansa has no romantic interest and sexual attraction to that guy at all despite having some rather positive views about his otherwise i also dont think that any of the main female characters will get an ending where theyre happily married and live ever after with the guy they were forced to marry because really  do you think grrm is writing these books to say hey forced marriages are awesome you young girls just have to learn to like it â it also goes completely against everything in tyrions arc while sansa wants someone who will love her for herself which is definitely not tyrion tyrion wants most of all someone who will really want him which is definitely not sansa there was never anything satisfying in that marriage for either of them and neither of them even wanted it unless you think that grrm was really always planning for a sudden twist in which sansa implausibly 100 changes her feelings and falls in lovefinds herself incredibly attracted with tyrion without any setup at all which would serve the narrative purpose of what tyrions wishfulfillment in the most unlikely way possible where instead of genuinely exploring tyrions personal issues with women and having tyrion grow as a person sansa becomes tyrions prize  a beautiful highborn virginal young trophy wife with a great claim who has come to see the light and fall for him for being such an awesome dude even though his character arc since they last met has been about him getting darker and darker â not gonna happen â â one possible reason why this could turn into a very important relationship  and why dd have made sure tyrion was quite a bit nicer than he was in the books  â the reason why they made sure tyrion was quite a bit nicer with sansa than he was in the books is the same reason why they made sure tyrion was quite a bit nicer with shae why he doesnt have a singer killed and made into a stew and why they made sure he was quite a bit nicer in every other situation because they want to make sure that the viewers like tyrion whether its because of how much they like tyrion or because they think that the tv audiences need an unambiguously likable main character to invest in after ned starks death or both â â since martin also wrote the marriage between the durrandon heir and orys baratheon which came to be in even worse circumstances for the unwilling bride it wouldnt be impossible for him to intend thatâ â â thats a part of the historical background from 300 years before and neither orys nor his wife are anywhere close to being major characters in the series  theyre barely characters â thats like saying that dany will end up becoming a slaver because her ancestors were slavers in valyria edited by annara snow 01 may 2014  0228

"Chebyshov",2014-05-01,"snip really well put it would absolutely undermine both sansa and tyrion as characters and this is also why im hoping the whole harry the heir thing is a big bust for sansaher ending up playing the good wife in a political marriage would be a huge regression maybe she could end up being friendly with tyrion but definitely not his wife"
"Pod The Impaler",2014-05-01,"i agree with everyone who said that splitting the snow scene and the moon door sequence would be a terrible decision â â"
"Wouter",2014-05-01,"â how â the only thing that tyrion can be the heir to is casterly rock dany and her forces are the likely victors in the fight for the iron throne  such as it will be by the

alone in a position of power dany and jon together or jon alone of course there are other possibilities like stannis or shireen or faegon â or even tommen but im going with the ones that seem more likely to me theres the question of survival and heirs jon and dany are main characters both have aspects of a messiah hell there are entire subsections of the fans on the forum devoted to push one or the other as azor ahai candidate and it would seem that one or both will play a decisive role in the conflict with the others messianic figures often end up paying a price for their heroic acts and

he lost something each time and was consumed by his mission at the time of death or victarion with his fiery unnatural hand or melisandre who doesnt really need to eat or to sleep he also swore a vow to not take lands and father no children and while he could break that in the interests of the defence against the others it could come back into play once the threat is defeated for now bottom line i doubt jon will end up being the father of a long line of heirs for the iron throne he may die in the war he may refuse to sit the throne he may decide to rule while needed but withdraw as soon as possible depending on how the resurrection works he may not even be strictly human anymore â for dany on the other hand we have the problem of heirs ever since the stillbirth of rhaego there is doubt about her fertility she has no immediate family and she will likely end up proving aegon is not rhaegars son and may well end up getting him killed marriages to hizdahr or to a greyjoy the latter suggested in the house of the undying are unlikely to yield a heir or to survive for long if she is attracted to jon he may not return the feeling or circumstances may be against them should dany not be able to give birth whatever the reason she has the problem of naming a heir the martells and baratheons are her closest kin i suppose but both stannis and arianne have likely been opposing her if not she could name stannisshireen or arianne as heir another option would be to look at her own followers and here is where tyrion could come into play especially if by this time he has proven his worth to her seems possible and has become a dragonrider viserion may be reserved for himâ and should it turn out he is aerys bastard or that dany believes him to be then he would even get a weak blood claim which may be enough in the absence of other targaryens â â â â as for the idea that they could actually be married and live as husband and wife for political reasons thats completely out of the question imo it goes against everything in sansas arc and everything in tyrions arc sansas arc has shown her being disillusioned with arranged marriages and people wanting her for her claim slowly starting to develop an acceptance of nonconventional behavior bastards women who have sexual relationships outside of marriage like ellaria or mya and generally changing her views on social conventions as well as developing her sexuality which in the books where we are in her head has been focusing on a completely socially inappropriate object of desire who would not be a suitable husband for a highborn lady in any way and the theme of sexual agency  and being denied it by others  are very prominent in her arc deciding to be a good wife in a political marriage would not fit with her character development deciding to be a good wife in a political marriageâ that she was forced into by her captors not gonna happen the marriage that she was forced into by her captors is finished except as a vehicle for sansas defense against other unwanted marriages i agree on that front however that doesnt mean that resuming the marriage cannot be renegotiated between the starks and those who would want the marriage tyrion andor dany in order to keep the north glued to the south essentially sansa would be sold  or would sell herself  for political gain not unlike what happened with the hizdahrdany marriage the marriage would then resemble lysa tullyjon arryn rather than arya starkramsay bolton â i see where you are coming from wrt sansas arc but that sansa has become disillusioned with arranged marriages doesnt have to mean that she will definitely end up avoiding those alltogether we dont know the mind of the author and as reader we have certain ideas about the overarching plot for each character but grrm may have other plans sansas mother entered a political marriage and i got the impression catelyn wasnt under any illusions about what was happening â agency is all well and good but this is a story about a culturetimeplace where it isnt the norm  especially for highborn women  to get much of a say in who they have to marry arya is more likely to just be able to chose her husband or to not enter any marriage at all because she is living outside the norms of her society sansa still seems to conform to the general social norms of westeros as of affc â â â i also dont think that any of the main female characters will get an ending where theyre happily married and live ever after with the guy they were forced to marry because really  do you think grrm is writing these books to say hey forced marriages are awesome you young girls just have to learn to like it â grrm has said that he hates allegories he is telling a story its not a political pamphlet and not necessarily meant as a source for life lessons i doubt he is saying hey assassins are awesone young girls just have to learn how to become that yet he is doing the arya arc the way he isâ â this is also why i mentioned the durrandon girl while we dont know if she ever got to like orys even a little bit certain is that this 100 forced marriage in circumstances that were even more humilating for the girl than sansatyrion ended up kickstarting the baratheon line i can hardly imagine that was a pleasant marriage but from a political pov apparently it was succesful aegon targaryen got away with it unlike tywin lannister â it also goes completely against everything in tyrions arc while sansa wants someone who will love her for herself which is definitely not tyrion tyrion wants most of all someone who will really want him which is definitely not sansa there was never anything satisfying in that marriage for either of them and neither of them even wanted itâ sansa never wanted it but tyrion  in books and show  really wanted it to work and tried to make it work in adwd there are signs that tyrion is irritated that sansa wasnt loyal to him im far from certain that tyrion would prefer penny who probably really wants him over sansa there is an intriguing line in his last adwd chapter where he mentions that he misses his wife and the context is deliberately kept vague enough to make it unclear whether he means sansa or tysha â â â â the reason why they made sure tyrion was quite a bit nicer with sansa than he was in the books is the same reason why they made sure tyrion was quite a bit nicer with shae why he doesnt have a singer killed and made into a stew and why they made sure he was quite a bit nicer in every other situation because they want to make sure that the viewers like tyrion whether its because of how much they like tyrion or because they think that the tv audiences need an unambiguously likable main character to invest to after ned starks death or both and by the same reasoning they would want to prepare the ground for acceptance of an eventual sansatyrion marriage and not just a mockery this time if they know this as endgame the show is already under fire for alleged sexism imagine the uproar in that case if they dont play their cards very carefully â i guess they will tone down tyrions behaviour in essos by the same token allthough he is probably going to kill shae this season â edited by wouter 01 may 2014  0333 pm"

out so well didnt they â suffice to say we seem to have completely different ideas about what this series is about i dont see it as a story about the three main heroes defeating the bad guys others dividing the land between them and installing a new dynasty with everyone else accepting their lot in life and the traditional roles that the society has imposed on them in order for the heroes to make this thing work â in any case your above scenario shows that you need a really complicated and convoluted scenario to justify why tyrion of all people would be named danys or jons heir to the iron throne in particular your scenario comes off as some really unlikely wish fulfillment stuff for tyrion including the tyrion is a targ theory if youre going to use the well grrm is describing the society the way it is and every character must accept their fate argument  then lets also accept the fact that that society is extremely prejudiced against disabled people especially those with congenital disabilities something that tyrions storyline has been all about and that tyrion would be the last person they would turn to as a biological father of future heirs to the throne your scenario is basically ways in which tyrion can get all sorts of awesome stuff and sansa doesnt get anything she wants well tyrion wouldnt get a wife who wants him but as a man in power he could still have mistresses â â i see where you are coming from wrt sansas arc but that sansa has become disillusioned with arranged marriages doesnt have to mean that she will definitely end up avoiding those alltogether we dont know the mind of the author and as reader we have certain ideas about the overarching plot for each character but grrm may have other plans sansas mother entered a political marriage and i got the impression catelyn wasnt under any illusions about what was happening â sansa is not catelyn the different main characters are actually different people with different motivations developments and arcs  and that goes for women as well as men if sansa is going to end up as a political pawn and an obedient wife in an arranged political marriage something people have been trying to make her be since book 1 then her entire arc and character development has been a colossal waste of time â â â agency is all well and good but this is a story about a culturetimeplace where it isnt the norm  especially for highborn women  to get much of a say in who they have to marry arya is more likely to just be able to chose her husband or to not enter any marriage at all

slavery like her forefathers were in any case she should not be acting like a revolutionary and freeing slaves jon shouldnt have been trying to makeâ wildlings a part of the realm theyre going against the norm of culturetimeplace and tyrion should not hope for any highborn marriage let alone to be chosen as a father of future heirs he should have been content with taking care of those drains and pipes if everyone is going to stick to the norm of their culturetimeplace what are we reading the story for martin is writing fantasy not historical fiction and heck even in historical fiction people have proven that they can go against the norm including women  whether it was choosing to make an inappropriate marriage out of love and ending tragically mary queen of scots or choosing to never marry and ending up ruling successfully for years elizabeth i â sansa never wanted it but tyrion  in books and show  really wanted it to work and tried to make it work in adwd there are signs that

he mentions that he misses his wife and the context is deliberately kept vague enough to make it unclear whether he means sansa or tysha â â tyrion never wanted it before his father cowed him into accepting it before that he had never considered sansa that way when he thought that sansa was going to be his wife for the rest of his life thats when he started wanting to make it work ironically contrary to what people like to claim sansa was far more rebellious as she never thought she should make it work or do her duty tyrion was the one who said come on sansa lets do our duty on their wedding night sansa was only thinking about obeying because she had no choice he never had any genuine interest in sansa as a person and was never really able to understand her she was reading him much better than he was able to read her he was just physically attracted to her liked the idea of being the lord of winterfell and started fantasizing about her coming willingly to his bed  like tysha 30  since her lack of desire for him hurt him because of his deep insecurities and yes youre right that he probably wouldnt want penny  just like he didnt want lollys who didnt want him like penny does but never made clear that she definitely didnt want him as sansa did  because tyrion is allowed to not marry people he doesnt find sexually attractive while sansa did not have that luxuryâ he didnt want sansa for herself he wanted his young beautiful virginal trophy wife with a claim to winterfell to want him it was pure wishfulfillment focused on making tyrion feel better about himself â which is  as far as tyrions arc goes  exactly why he didnt get it and is unlikely to ever get it â â and by the same reasoning they would want to prepare the ground for acceptance of an eventual sansatyrion marriage and not just a mockery this time if they know this as endgame the show is already under fire for alleged sexism imagine the uproar in that case if they dont play their cards very carefully â i guess they will tone down tyrions behaviour in essos by the same token allthough he is probably going to kill shae this season â â id really love to know how you made the logical leap from they made tyrion nicer overall so the audience could have a completely likable main character to invest in to and this is why they made tyrion more likable  so the audience would accept the sansatyrion marriage which is evidence that sansa will end up married to tyrion â so now youre saying that dd knew from the beginning of the show that there is a sansatyrion endgame and that all the changes to tyrion  whitewashing as many call it  from day one was in order to prepare the audience for his allimportant sansatyrion endgame as evidenced by the fact that tyrion is generally nicer who would think that the whole purpose of tyrions portrayal on the show has been to make him a better match for sansa and people were complaining that they were making sansa a prop in tyrions story â the show is already under fire for alleged sexism imagine the uproar in that case if they dont play their cards very carefully â â oh i have news for you if the show ends with that sansatyrion endgame it will be accused of sexism in any case and rightfully so if there is this sansatyrion endgame that the entire show has been preparing for you know which change they should have made not have sansa forcibly married to tyrion if youre changing everything about the characters and their dynamics then instead of making shae a genuine love story make sansa fall for tyrion and choose tyrion on her own

"CaptainTheo",2014-05-04,"about the wedding ring  i noticed sansa actually does take it off at least once as she isnt wearing it when she gets out of bed the morning after she marries tyrion this might be a pointless observation admittedly simply that she takes it off when sleeping i really hope that they dont drop the bit about sansa pretending to be alayne it would be a real shame to omit this as i find this alterego fascinating like just about everything else in sansas storyline â apologies for commenting about a point of discussion much earlier in this thread  i didnt look at this thread until today edited by captaintheo 04 may 2014  0709 pm"

"mjc5156",2014-04-30,"ive been reading this forum for a few years now figured it was about time to finally make my first post ive seen a few posts about the possibility of sandor clegane living beyond his book expiration date if you in fact believe that he is dead but this is another topic for another post and wanted to throw my theory out there â instead of suffering a mortal wound in one of the upcoming episodes to which arya responds with the gift of mercy i think its a feasible modification to keep him alive to aid arya in her travels to bravos he mentions to arya i believe s4e01 that he intends to make for bravos and join up with the second sons he stays alive and assists arya in getting to bravos at which point they split up arya will not want to leave bravos as she has the coin from jacquen and will not agree to join up with a company of sell swords instead the hound will continue on to meet up with and join the second sons both as a form of work to keep him alive and as a mechanism for vengeance by fighting for the opposite side of the lannisters and in turn the mountain â the hound becoming a second son could serve a couple purposes in the show first since barristan the bold was identified by jorah almost immediately and thus no retaliation from barristan telling dany that jorah has been spying on her for varys the hound can replace barristan as the one to reveal jorahs spying to dany â this would also serve to replace some of strong belwasâ<U+0080><U+0099>s role â<U+0080><U+0093> first when belwas smashes in the teeth of ghael the envoy from astapor due to his similarly massive size and strength sandor can also replace strong belwas by eating the poisoned locusts intended for dany once dany leaves he can remain in mereen with ser barristan setting up a potential meeting between the hound and tyrion down the road â weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve seen multiple instances on the show of dd replacing actions of a minor character with a major character that we have already been introduced to eg gendry replacing edric storm and this change could serve as a similar mechanism since we have no strong belwas l in the show â what are everyoneâ<U+0080><U+0099>s thoughts"
"JonSnow1234",2014-05-02,"if arya leaves for bravos in the last few episodes of the season then there will not be time for him to make it to mereen for the jorah reveal as that is likely to come at the end of this season as well apart from that i quite like the idea mostly because i dont want the hound to lose screen time"

"Kaspiro",2014-05-03,"so at this point there are two ways sandors storyline could continue he does not die at all which i find possible but unlikely given how significant a deviation from the books it or that the show creates a new death for him akin to rakharos new death in the red wasteâ the hound joining the second sons would be interesting given that he could join daenerys im not sure i see it happening because a it is a significant deviation like i said above and bit seems like daenerys would already be fairly prejudiced against house clegane but i could definitely see the appeal and thought process behind it â thinking of potential new deaths for sandor i cant help remembering that sandor is currently journeying to ransom arya to lysa arryn in the eyrie though he definitely wont be making this transaction to get to the eyrie he would have to travel through the mountains of the moonâ my personal theory is that sandor and arya travel through the mountains of the moon and meet with shagga and his stone crows or some other clan chief and clanâ im pretty sure a fair portion of the showonly audience still recall the unique comical mountain clans from seasons 1 and 2 i dont think at this point reintroducing them would be particularly difficultâ â sandor is unable or unwilling to negotiate with them and wins the fight against them but is wounded arya leaves him to die as before and the story continues on as normal arya could easily travel to some vale town perhaps gulltown even to get on a ship to braavos and sandor could plausibly make his way to the quiet isle from the vale it would be a fairly good opportunity to bring back some wellliked characters im sure more than a few people wouldnt be adverse to seeing shagga again and stay consistent with the storylineâ"
"CandleWisps",2014-05-03,"if snador did travel with arya across the narrow sea then continue on to the second sons it would be a nice tietogether factor of westerosessos and minimize multiple roles down into one to prevent having to cast more people with an already tightish budget personally i dont see it happening because of the reasons mentioned above fear of fire dany will in no way be positively predisposed towards a clegane etc that doesnt mean its impossible and imo it might be better than following book canon after the hound dies we just have the gravedigger and nothing else so far in the book material he doesnt do anything and we just have theories as to when hell go off to rescue sansa or what have you if they were going to follow book canon and assuming gravediggersandor it would be probably be a waste of budget to follow around the guy with a suspicious identity for awhile with no plot direction imo theyll either completely deviate his storymix it with anotheror the ops second sons theory or they will kill him off for good they cant really just have him sort of hang around not when there are other people to cast and spend money on etc so i wouldnt necessarily mind you sellsword idea as it gives him screentime and ties the different continents together but i also wouldnt mind or be surprised if they give him another purpose"
"FNF",2014-05-03,"i would like the hound to stay onscreen i dont know how they can do that though but this doesnt sound like a bad idea the only problem is the timing as the jorah was a spy reveal will happen pretty much when arya sets sail for braavos imo"
"Newstar",2014-05-03,"i feel it was mentioned as a reminder to the audience about mercenary companies across the narrow sea following this scene was davos mentioning the golden company also acts as a way to have arya mention that she wants to go to braavos â same bryan cogman mentioned that he threw in olennas little anecdote about her targaryen betrothed to remind the audience about the absolute power the targaryens once held in westeros i expect that the writers were trying to do something similar with the mention of braavos and the mercenary companies because the storylines are so disparate i think the writers will do whatever they can to draw connections where possible"

"HairGrowsBack",2014-05-01," annar snow  dont get me wrong im really interested in what happened to her and think it would be nice to find itâ out and im definitely empathetic towards her and what shes been through however yes i dont think grrm meant for her to be thought outside of tyrions narrative not unlike shae it can be seen as yet another case of women suffering for the benefit of male tears which it is but it being tyrions story and tysha having nothing to do with other aspects of the narration lead to her beingâ under developed thats the problem  having small folk pov would be nice but completely unrelated to the general narrative as they never mingle with highborn characters who comprise most of the main characters â if we ever see her all i hope is that she isnt getting back in any way with tyrion that would be just plain wrong imo"
"acosta",2014-05-01,"shes an interesting character for sure but at some point you really do just need to let rosencrantz and guildenstern disappear into the periphery where they belong you cant fully explore and develop every single minor character the story is bloated enough as is its time to go ahead and kill off a few more povs and tighten the focus he already has to resolve the major storylines that matter brans continued training and the answer to what his purpose is the resolution to littlefingers plot to retake the north in sansas name the battle for the north between stannis and bolton and davos returning with rickon cerseis trial and the future of the crown aegons attack through the stormlands where the martells are going to finally find an alliance whether or not the dragonhorn works is daenerys ever heading west those are just big plot points and he has barely even begun to introduce the single more important plotline the attack of the others then you have a whole bunch of loose ends to tie up that probably matter but we dont know why like what the hell is a faceless man doing in the citadel why is tom osevenstrings in riverrun pretending to serve the lannisters and freys then he has to resolve all the storylines that probably dont matter but we want to know anyway just because the characters has been around forever and we want to know what happens like is stoneheart going to kill jaime lannister what becomes of all the red wedding hostages is randyl tarly up to no goodâ and frankly even tyrion himself is not a player any more the second sons were turning for daenery with or without him its not clear he is still going to have any meaningful impact on a major plotline at this point we just want to know what happens to him because hes an original pov and popular with the readers but he probably could have been executed back in storm of swords without it making any difference to who ultimately sits the throne who ultimately controls winterfell and whether or not the wall fails and whether humanity survives winter and the others thats the story at this point not what becomes of tyrions exwife from twenty years ago theres already way too much to wrap up and as far as we know grrm is already still introducing new povs and new geographical settings it has to end eventuallyâ"

"Modesty Lannister",2014-05-01,"â that implies godly involvement maybe north of the wall the great other can do this if he is even real but that means craster himself should have been taken away as a child unless the others came seeking his blood only when he was an adult and he cut a deal with them interesting theory â one thought i had is why has bloodraven allowed craster to live for so long coldhands or a murder of ravens would have easily taken care of the bastard even if craster was his son bloodraven is not above kinslaying nor would he care that craster offers a shelter to rangers from time to time when i think of it now and i never thought of that before so do not expect any deep thoughts bloodraven can be involved anyway first of all he was lc of the nw so if we follow the logic of the icy 13 being former lcs of the nw he would qualify to join them at some point why didnt he though is it because of his targaryen blood that he somehow cannot be turned due to the fire element that annuls the icy nature of the others where does his sorcery come from i didnt read the original book where bloodraven appears so i cannot say much why did he side with cotf if craster is indeed his son he would be 14 targaryen wouldnt the same rule of incompatibility with others apply to him and his children i am not saying it would im thinking while writing lets consider this craster died in 299ac he is described as an old man lets say he was around 70 that would mean he was born in 220s who was the lc of the nw then bloodraven was born in 175ac and sent to the wall in 233ac so he was 58 when he joined the nw not young at all and he did not become a lc the same year anyway it is still possible that he is indeed crasters father if we consider craster to be around 60 years old we dont know who bloodravens predecessor as lc was do we i couldnt find it that predecessor may be the strongest candidate for fathering craster him or bloodraven â however we may look at this from another angle if the icy 13 are indeed former lc of the nw they would ensure that all oathbreakers are punished starks do it south of the wall the others would do it north of the wall so the punishment for desertion is death what would a punishment for taking a wife or fathering a child be maybe taking the offspring from the realms of men and turning them into others since women took no oath there should be no punishment for them so as long as a brother of the nw keeps producing offspring they will be taken and turned but just boys so that the oathbreakers line cannot continue girls will continue someone elses line â craster was not taken thats an anomaly why maybe because bloodraven as his father protected him with his sorcery and powers learned from cotf by producing offspring with his own daughters craster ensures his bloodline stays pure and he offers his sons to others sounds like some deal and penance for being spared to me â consequently if we agree on all previous assumptions mance rayder should be killed by others as a deserter and his son taken and turned unless he is also protected by bloodraven for some reason note that mance wears a helmet with raven wings that may suggest some connection there he also wears a targaryen coloured cloak black with three streaks of red silk â whatever we may conclude from this it would seem the others may show up at the wall to take gillys son jons decision to remove mances son from the wall may have interesting consequences then thoughts edited by modesty lannister 01 may 2014  1054 am"

"Dan Bingler",2014-05-01,"i read most of the posts and responses of this thread and many theories are interesting it was definitely a provocative episode and as someone who has read the books more than a couple times and has perused the forum speculation to no end there were parts i really resisted at first bran and jon seemingly being drawn to meet at crasters and parts that blew me away immediately the mostmentioned part the final scene ive reread all of the books recently so its pretty fresh in my mind so hopefully my opinion will be met with something less than apprehension as for the people complaining about show reveals from the future books sorry you feel inconvenienced but get over yourselves you knew going into this show series that it would be a slippery slope and now halfway through youre upset dont watch or do and accept the consequences i thought brans weirwood vision revealed more about future books than this scene did the hbo synopsis gaffe aside anyhow â what the last scene suggested to me upon watching nothing at all about coldhands at all an important ritual allows the white walkers to bolster their ranks in some way whether the result is a bastard halfhuman halfwhite walker creature is unknown the ritual is not a method to create wights the proximity of white walkers to dead humans and other living creatures as evidenced in book and show is enough to create wights this ritual could only bewould only be performed ceremoniously and with a specific individual  with distinctive head markings differentiating him from others  doing the turning so to speak a total of 13 white walkers attended this ceremony â now heres my speculation since i finished watching thought about the books and read what you kindgenerally informed folks have discussed  and i think its worth mentioning that my context is one in which the show runners know a lot more about the story than people seem to give them credit for here its just my assumption of course but i think that they dont just know the ending but are frequently in discussion with grrm about how the story is shaping up i dont know that of course but it sure makes sense to me more than them mostly making things up between books 5 and 7 so basically if the books strongly point to the significance of something im going to assume that the show will also do so and i dare say to you all the other way around continuing â  while at the time of watching it was obvious to me that the white walker who was performing the ritual was in some way distinguished that it is the nights king which i fully believe is accurate but a mistaken reveal by stoned interns filling out the website changes things a bit in that it is someone who per the books was not a white walker and became a white walker or again some facsimile or bastardization i think this is enough to prove that the nights king cannot also be the great other to address that speculation of contraction for the show we know a woman matching the description of a white walker albeit a cutenonbony one seduced the 13th lord commander and turned him and that he was sacrificing to the others  now we basically see how that was done this suggests to me that the great other sent her  and needed the nights king or a human to be turned in some specific way in order for that person to be able to afflict other humans perhaps in a different way which is why they need babies obviously a person in power was a better target since he would have a means to defend his practices his defeat at the hands of the king of the north and the king beyond the wall apparently either did not destroy him and we see him now continuing those practices in order to continue to fill the white walker not wight ranks out or a new nights king has taken his place the last hero who was mentioned once in tale and never again is an intriguing thought because of the number 13 he and his 12 companions and a dog set off on a lastditch effort against the others all his friends died and he seemed doomed but we dont know the result of the tale but the significance of 13 the nights king was the 13th lord commander he reigned for 13 years the last hero was one of 13 companions what does this all mean who knows it doesnt mean anything right now thats for sure but it does make you wonder â i cant really speculate much more than that because it didnt really answer anything but i wanted to address some of the better and worse speculations i read through here in the past few daysâ i think its also important to remind ourselves that were a tiny segment of curious individuals who really really enjoy this series and that if grrm or anyone involved in the show were making story decisions based upon anything we say or think theyd be fools lets just enjoy the books enjoy the shows realize theyre different and alike at the same time and not take ourselves too seriously when we want to guess at what may or may not be happening in the future of westeros i personally love to speculate and wonder and read everyone elses constructive thoughts its really a fun thing to do and i was excited to find out what people thought about such a interesting

"Zman1863",2014-04-29,"â â â abolition of chattel slavery was accomplished peacefully throughout most of the world in america however emancipation was a bloody nightmare the incidental outcome of an invasion launched for the enrichment of the conquerors at the expense of the conquered a century after emancipation racism still afflicted the country and in many ways had actually gotten worse by overthrowing the consent of the governed the shield of liberty with force of arms the sword of tyranny the union was preserved in name but destroyed in spirit and the emancipation of the chattel slaves came at the cost of the political enslavement of all free men the ends dont justify the means two wrongs dont make a right etc of course ceteris paribus emancipation was a positive outcome of the socalled civil war but the point is that it could have been achieved without any devastating loss of life and liberty of all the emancipations in the world american emancipation came at the greatest cost and with the worst results â ironically secession by the north or south would have hastened slaverys demise because the constitution provided for the rendition of fugitive slaves and arguably permitted the expansion of slavery into american territory slavery was safer in the union than an independent confederacy by depriving the south of these constitutional protections the stability of slavery  particularly concerning runaway slaves  would have been seriously undermined abolitionists such as william garrison supported northern secession in order to destabilize slavery as well as disassociate themselves from the institution others such as george bassett and lysander spooner supported southern secession on principle if governments truly are consensual rather than coercive then the people have the sovereign right to dissolve their union with a government to which they no longer consent regardless of their reasons â â its unconvincing to argue that the loss of the protections of slavery in the us constitution by the seceded states would have hastened the end of slaveryâ â first the fugitive slave acts in congress were being actively resisted and in some cases outright ignored in northern states in other words the south wasnt getting anywhere near the benefit of the fugitive slave clauseâ beforeâ the south seceded â with regard to slaverys expansion being a sovereign nation or nations or whatever the confederacy claimed to be would have given them more freedom to expand slavery than they ever had in the union while in the union the slave states had to tangle with the resistance of the free states with regard to the status of slavery in acquired territories out of the union they no longer had this resistance the evidence is overwhelming that southern leaders envisioned more territorial acquisitions in mexico the caribbean and even south america and of course such moves would have certainly increased tensions with their northern neighbor and probably would have precipitated a war â finally those territorial acquisitions for more slave territory wouldnt have been exactly peaceful it would have been like dany conquering slavers bay only you know for slaveryâ â â â"

"Thelastactionhero",2014-04-30,"oh my gosh a voice of reason in this fast becoming sea of silly notions and the continual idea of people trying to put modern day moral standards into a fantasy world set in the medieval like times wmagic â â i personally dont have all that many qualms regarding her crucifying the 163 masters it makes sense given the established cultural ideology of this fictional period my problem is simply that in any of these three slave revolts dany has led in season 3 and 4 we only ever see slavers getting murked during the conflict honestly can you ever imagine sacking a city without having a substantial amount of innocent life destroyed in the process hell it even conflicts with jorahs speech back in astapor where he talks about the day tywin sacked kings landing its not about whether its right or wrong for her to invade these cities i think her intentions are noble though too idealistic and misguided but rather that because these visual representations fail to show us the brutality of the conflicts in terms of how they effect the smallfolk were left with dany the superhero killing bad guys rather than dany the liberator freeing slaves though at great cost like seriously a bunch of slaves without armor leading an internal revolt in mereen without even a single on screen casuality i dont think budgetary reasons are a proper excuse because we at least see the aftermath of plenty of battles throughout the series dany needed to be confronted with the brutal reality of sacking these cities so that she can confront her own selfdoubts so that she can become a fully threedimensional character instead of an immaculate white messiah figure which personally is making me increasingly uncomfortable in the books she has members of her own army guilty of looting and raping executed and gelded which shows that these invasions are not supposed to go as incredibly smoothly as they do on television its not even about just about making danys arc more grey so much as its about staying true to the gritty realism of martins world â now granted i think the crucifying in this episode was done quite well and it was given to us in a way that is nuanced yet still a darker turn for the character i honestly think scenes like this are the sorts that i would have liked to see with stannis rather than burning an innocent alive for bullshit reasons we have stannis of the books burning alester florent for trying to broker peace with the lannisters and sell them back shireen as well as establish prosperous winds in order to reach the wall in time he may well deserve to be executed but does he deserve to be burned alive not in my view and yet this conflict sets us in a place where we sympathize with both stannis and the man that hes condemned rather than the televisions rendition of stannis the religous puppet burning infidels willy nilly in danys case it would have been just to execute those responsible but she goes a step further by having them crucified without any sort of trial or second thought barristan understands that these slavers may well in fact deserve to die but sees the potential ramifications of these actions which are driven in no small degree by vengeance not that you can blame her after seeing all those murdered children the reason that i take issue with the series adaptation as of late is because the showrunners have displayed the ability to convey moral ambiguity fantastically but the nuance just doesnt seem consistent enough across character arcs this is where the charges of bias come from because whenever they streamline something with stannis its in a way that makes him look utterly evil whenever they streamline something with dany its in a way that makes her look like clark kentjesus i absolutely love both characters in the novels which is why im disappointed that the series has cheapened them both by giving us such lopsided depictions rather than working harder to sustain the atmosphere of nuance that makes them both so fascinating"

"Seneti",2014-04-25,"i really hope not i can completely accept bronn refusing to be tyrions champion who could blame him but if he actively betrayed tyrion well as a lover of all things bronn that particular deviation would really piss me off â i think it would be completely incharacter for bronn remember what he said to tyrion before hes not his friend bronns loyalty is connected to gold and while tyrion may have lots of it tywin as head of the lannister has much more of it thats the difficulty with sellswords just look at what happened to the masters of astapor â im starting to understand why they made the changes to shaes characterâ since show shae is actually in love with tyrion her betrayal will be much more shocking to the audience and much more devastating to tyrion also by slightly whitewashing tyrion they are setting him up for a steeper collapse into darkness this new dynamic should make the scene where tyrion does finally kill shae much more dark twisted and heart breaking than it was in the booksâ if they handle it correctly then this should make for great tv â exactly this this is what they have been going for since season 2 personally the death of book shae was more of a meh moment for me i did not care for her at all but whether you love her or hate her  people care about show shae â in episode 2 tywin said bring her to the tower of the hand before the wedding or something like that i think shae never leave kl and tywin have her all this time im not sure if bronn goes along with it and betrayed tyrion or if shae and tywin manage to fool him tooâ â i think it went something like this â 1 varys warning tyrion that hes not going to lie about shae 2 cersei tells tywin about shae tywin orders her brought to the tower of the hand 3 tyrion sends shae away 4 bronn takes shae to the docks â at this point there are two options of what could have happened once bronn tries to put shae on that boat â 5a  bronn was still there when the guards showed up for shae and he betrayed tyrion because he knows that tywin has more power and money than tyrion 5b  bronn left shae at the boat but not on the boat the guards showed up and either arrested shae against her will or she decided to go with them to spitedefy tyrion and in doing so underestimated just how powerful and cruel tywin can be â either way shae most likely ended up at the tower of the hand by episode 3 â â haha well obv id love for them to do it just dont know if even dd will be able to i mean the chronology is gonna be nuts episode 8 oberyn gets killed seemingly ending tyrions hopes the duel will probably take up like 810 minutes with the before and after then in episode 9 the wall gets defended ygritte dies the wildlings attack again and stannis saves the day given how much stuff they still have to do in episode 10dany locks up her dragons tyrion escapes and kills tywin bran reaches the cave jon maybe gets elected lc or in true got the show fashion has toâ choose between becoming lc or lord of winterfell because of course the show would pull something stupid like that arya arrives in braavos and uncat to end the seasoneven with 65 minutes thats a lot of big stuff already do you think the unsullied will be able to handle all that stuff plus the knowledge that ygritte probably a big favorite for them and oberyn probably a new favorite for them bite the dust in the previous eps theyre going to break the internet over tywins death i really really would love to see lysa fly this season as well but just have doubts that its going to happen and if i have to pick between that and uncat this year well you know which one is going to win â honestly yes i do think almost all of that is going to be in â episode 8  oberyn dies  hound will most likely receive his wound leading to arya leaving him  lysas jealousy will be fleshed out at that point â episode 9  battle of the wall north and south including ygrittes death and stannis stannis stannis â episode 10 scenes not necessarily in the order listed â essos 7 minutes  dead farmers girl  2 minutes  dany chaining her dragons  5 minutes â beyond the wall 10 minutes  bran and co arriving at bloodravens cave  fight with wights 10 minutes tops â at the wall 5 to 15 minutes  stannis offering winterfell to jon in vain  about 5 minutes  possibly jons election as lord commander which  from a dramatic standpoint  would contrast very well with stanniss offer giving him the choice between honorduty to the realm and honorduty to one wannabe king  about 7 to 10 minutes split between different scenes beginning of election possibly sams manipulations result â kings landing 10 to 14 minutes  jaimetyrion convo in which tyrion revels cerseis secrets and jaime reveals his tysha  about 5 to 7 minutes tops  tyrion kills shae and tywin  5 to 7 minutes tops â eyrie 5 to 7 minutes  struggle between lysa and sansa only cat  5 to 7 minutes tops â riverlands 5 minutes  ls reveal 5 minutes  arya leaving for bravos 3 to 5 minutes â this would make 58 minutes total and since we have 65 that would make it even more likely and yes i do think the viewers will be able to handle it anybody who can handle

"Metopheles",2014-04-27,"well given the sheer amount of characters and the necessity to prevent things from being and asspull yes its not about alzheimer or bad memory its just that the show is huge yeah but when reading the books you dont have that problem do you and the show covers one book in 10 hours reading a book takes longer and all i dont know how to explain this but why would there be such a need to reintroduce characters that often â if i remember correctly in breaking bad they did not have to reintroduce characters that much especially the vacuum guy he was mentioned very early in the second or third season and then in the fifth after countless of months between it â book readers give the tv guys way too few credit â and i hope it doesnt become to a yellow umbrella thing like in himym where literally every episode states how the mother will look and all as if the viewer forgets it every time"
"Arkash",2014-04-27,"yeah but in the books you have the name written quite anytime the character speaks and photographic memory of the written name is stronger than auditive memory of just hearing it once or twice"
"King Tommen",2014-04-27,"the books mention character names in each scene which is why book readers have no issue remembering who anyone is thats just how books work they have to set the scene so every single time we switch to a different scene and every time somebody speaks we get to read what their name is â a tv show has a scene with lots of characters in it but rarely do we actually get their names mentioned unless it can be brought up somewhat organically thats why if you ask a showonly viewer who a minor character is theyre much more likely to be able to give you a physical description guy with the eye patch or their defining character trait danys translator girl it doesnt mean they understand the show any less but in any tv show names are going to be hard to come up with unless you pay attention religiously to the recaps so sometimes the show has to cheat and bring up a persons name and what theyre motivation is occasionally to remind the audience especially a show that literally has almost a hundred characters going at the same time"
