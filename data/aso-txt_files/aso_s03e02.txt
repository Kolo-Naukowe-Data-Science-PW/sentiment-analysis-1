"Stallion That Mounts Texas",2013-04-07,"so many changes i gave it a 6 1 i like being able to see the breaking of theon from the start he has no idea he being set up by ramsay 2 i like how marg is manipulating joff and i loved the queen of thornes i missed butterbumps 3 the fight between brienne and jaime was awful i know the first four episodes are setup but this one was kind of ordinary"
"Lord Godric",2013-04-07,"i knew people would hate the jon snow scene but i dont see why exactly it didnt change catelyn it reinforced that she could never love jon no matter what"
"Darth Pipes",2013-04-07,"i thought it was good i liked jaime and briennes scenes a lot the duel was good although i really wish it had ended the way it did in the book with them fighting in the river the reeds made a good first impression and rigg was terrific as olenna joffrey is one disturbed piece of  who just cant function like a normal human beingjack gleason does a great job with him and i like how maegarey manipulated him thoros was not how i expected him to look but the character was quite entertaining im not trusting talisasomething seems off the cat scene didnt bother me believing that her treatment of jon is the reason shes having all her problems i dont agree with but the scenario she laid out i can buy oh dolorus eddlove that scene"

"Zman1863",2013-04-07,"liked it quite a bit however i had a problem with two scenes hated the scene with catelyn talking about jon snow im not a huge fan in the books but i cant see what the point of inventing all this maudlin sentimentality they do seem to pile the blame for the travails of the starks on her and now they have her screen version admitting guilt because of a failing the book character would never have acknowledged the scene with tyrion and shae didnt work for me either a rare instance when a tyrion scene fell flat for me"

"ServantOnIce",2013-04-07,"10 up there with blackwater and better than any episode other than blackwater last season"
"Bride of Winter",2013-04-07,"the best episode ive seen in a long time possibly since season 1 imo would have been a 10 im giving it a 9 because of weird timing  some scenes were too drawn out where others were cut too short the scenes with the reeds seemed a bit awkwardly short considering it was their time to be introduced and im also a little peeved they cut the discussion of marrying willas from the sansamargolenna scene"

"Mark Antony",2013-04-07,"i gave it a 7 the sansaqueen of thorns scene was awesome i really enjoyed the branreeds and jaimebrienne scenes as well nothing else really stood out to me the catelyn scene was hard to watch i just started petting my dog oh thoros was pretty good i guess but i felt the arya scenes were just okay edit forgot about the theon scenes i thought they were really well done think i might change my score to a 8 edited by mark antony 07 april 2013  0918 pm"

"teemo",2013-04-07,"i really did not enjoy this episodeit felt about 4 hours long and lots of unnecessary stuff the i love jon snow monologue is terrible from every aspectthe writing was piss poor and cheesy not something that grrm would ever write it sounded like talisas sob story about her brotherwhere its so contrived my eyes start to glaze over i fail to see the point of all of the cerseijoffrey tension this was such a downgrade from last week sadpng classbbcemoticon alt "

"go joff go",2013-04-07,"i gave it a 95 not much i didnt like i cant believe how many scenes they got in there without it feeling jumpy it was kind of the opposite of last weeks episode which felt slow paced"
"cybobbie",2013-04-07,"well i really liked and i justify my high score simply because of some great scenes specially jaime and brienne and the queen of thorns with sansa jaimes and olennas lines were brilliant i also loved the brotherhood appearance and the reeds i only could not give a better score because shae still is too painful to watch and of course cats scene was something that im still digesting"

"Linda",2013-04-07,"mostly a pretty lacklustre episode i actually found it very hard to remember much about it at all when we sat down to work on the reviews nothing really stood out except the awful awful catelyn scene awful in the sense of the complete mess they made of the character i suppose the acting was alright i continue to find margaery nothing but annoying the way dormer portrays her miscast for sure"

"Ser Creighton",2013-04-08,"not really a fan of the episode i didnt love or hate it so i gave it a five not sure why the hate for the cat scene i didnt like it but i can understand the logic in her train of thought what really preplexed me was why they even shot it didnt really feel like it was needed they complain about having to much material to shoot but keep making up scenes and cutting out meteriali get why they do it sometimes but sometimes they just dont need to do it same for tyrion this week i like the dink and he is a hell of an actor but that was by far the worst scene i have seen in the series the acting was flat and the writing boardered on a sitcom thought sophie turner was excellent this week and her scene with the queen of thornes was pretty much pitch perfect love the fact that she got across that she would never have said anything but they brought up her father and you can catch that flash of anger once that was out there was no point in her holding back i love the cat and mouse game marg is playing with joff and the fact joff has no clue he is the mouse jack was once again outstanding i think the woman playing marg is doing a good job considering she does not really fit the part i always found her annoying in the books and here she still annoys me not really in a bad way though thought the fight with jamie and bree needed more build up and would have liked to have seen the two actors more this week but god forbid the dink is not in an episode also would have prefered a closer adaptation from the books the fight in the books had more tension frustration and anger it also felt a little like some strange form of for lack of a better word flirting also she beat jamie way to easily it boardered on humiliation that fight ends up setting up some common respect between the two and not one person destroying the other they became much more like peers because of that fight in this case it felt like hbo was changing brees name to little miss mary sue the reeds what a waste they skipped the intro so we could see dink get a an old fashioned as a reader of the books i know who those characters are like the back of my hand but for the people who have not read the books they saw two total strangers from god knows where walk up and all of a sudden they are just going with bran who are they why are they there how did they find bran what is there purpose nothing it was just like hey were going with you jon snow when are they going to actually put jon on the show he is about as pivitol a character as you will find in the series and his story is by and large abscent from the show you know take out the very unnecessary and pointless cat and dink scenes and you could of had more bree and jamie more jon more arya and the merry men and and actually introduce the reeds that was a pure hack job also reek is better as a surprise but this should be an intresting journey to watch get rid of the added scenes and the show is going to flow betten and you will get a little more time with the none tyrion characters to develop their stories and characters i thought sansa and the queen saved the show this week from being a total mess it was all over the place had horrible pacing and just about every actor not playing tyrion is getting cut short by a lack of time and development its a 5 all five belonging to sophie and jack"

"Gregg",2013-04-08,"i actually thought the cat scene was ok minus the last line if anything it hammered home her hatred of jon she wished him dead the fact that she momentarily felt bad for wishing that did not change anything for me i also think it was also a subtle way to remind viewers that the issue of jons parentage is still outstanding and that there may be some ironies involved with it with jon at the wall and beyond i think it is needed to remind the viewer nonreader that his character may have a role in the big picture i think overall we are starting to see the difficulties of translating so many story lines into a tv series 1 hour at a time the tyrionshae scene had the feel of can we really leave him completely out of an episode no weve got to give him at least one scene so yes i thought that was dumb scene i wonder how confused the nonreader is at this point"

"WinterWarrior",2013-04-08,"i gave it a 7 and i am usually much more upbeat about the episodes for some reason this one did not hang together well in my opinion too many story lines i am really glad i have read the books multiple times or i would have had a difficult time following it i think the cat scene was to keep jon snow front and center hbo is focused on jon and dany which is good in my opinion i am wondering how they will do the scene where she argues against robb making jon his heir after this scene maybe robb will do it and she will agree the actor who plays bran has grown up so much over one year it was startling his deep voice i love the reeds but not sure if i liked the way they were written in last night they were sort of creepy and in the book they are warm and supportive also what happened to rickon i am sure they did not have him go off with shaggy doghe better show up later i can see a split happening though with osha and rickon going off as they do in the book too much time wasted on shae and tyrioni think the shae story line will play out much differently in the hbo series i think she will be hung margaery is excellent as was olenna i hate joff but the actor is amazing and i love the hound"
"Sansa in the North",2013-04-08,"the cat thing was just wrong the fact that she was making one of these thingies for jon in the first place when only a mother can make one for her child sort of implies like she thought she was jons mother or at least stepmothersurrogate mother which she never did and the rest of westeros never thought that either if dd did this to make cat more likeable like people are suggesting then i dont understand them because in my opinion it actually makes her less likeable cat is one of my favourites and she doesnt need to be a mother archetype and coddle jon snow in order to be likeablealso hot pie fat shaming not cool funny but still it was too muchother than that wow what en episode the jamiebrienne banter was priceless and the olenna scene was perfect exactly as i imagined it theyve really done a good job on the tyrells the arrival of the reeds was pretty kickass toofemale rivalries osha vs meera catelyn vs talisa shae vs rosamen i hated those too most women dont act like that towards other women outside of sitcoms i also just dont like this jealousshae angel they seme to be takingall in all 710 i enjoyed this episode less than the premier which i understand is not a popular opinion or is it edited by sansa in the north 08 april 2013  0915 am"
"Serr Parker",2013-04-08,"810 for me lots of people abusing it saying it doesnt stay true to the books well if youve read the books it would make a pretty boring series wouldnt it much better than the first too many different angles though i think well often see episodes without 23 main character view points ayra bran jamie in ep1 daenerys stannis ep 2 im going to watch it again now edit this when ive seen it again"
"house of no sigil",2013-04-08,"710 i gave a 6 to 301 mostly because they previewed the wights in 210 and then didnt deliver them this episode was a lot like that one minus that huge letdown great acting all around and a couple bits of good drama but mostly just advancing storylines for bigger things later on which is necessary and i am good with that i really liked jaimes banter with brienne and i thought the fight was done ok served its purpose well enough the sansamargeryqot scene was great like everyone else i am really liking marg and it seems that the edition of the qot will only make that line better it was good to see the arya storyline back and i thought thoros was good too the reeds also did not disappoint and the theon scenes were done very well the joffcersei and joffmarg scenes served their purpose of character developement and the struggle for power and influence the nw and wildlings scenes felt like just a bit of filler kind of like hey nothing much is really going on with us this week but dont forget about us maybe next week youll get to see some giants or zombies glad they didnt do that same type of thing with the dany or stannis lines that brings us to tyrionshae and cats monologue i thought one was annoying and one was new and interesting i think its pretty obvious that peter is the iconic image of got and i understand that hbo wants to get him on screen whenever they can but the love story thing is flat hes much better as a whoring drinking manipulator i understand how the scene fit into the developement of the story but it was highly unnecessary i just found it boring cats jon snow revelation on the other hand was excellent i know thats a minority opinion here on this forum but i really thought it brought a new nuance to her character although not as big of one as everybody else seems to think shes always been pious so i dont think her believing that she is being punished for not upholding a promise she made to the gods is such a giant stretch and i really dont think it will have much effect on her future story so im a bit confused with all the handwringing over it next week i expect dragons and whitewalkers edited by house of no sigil 08 april 2013  0912 am"

"insertname",2013-04-08,"im going to give it a seven because i like most introduced characters but it wasnt that strong of an episode"
"MisunderstoodFrey",2013-04-08,"okay a little disappointed having looked at the many very positive reactions here before watching it i feel like two episodes of almost entirely scenesetting to start the season is a bit heavy but fine necessary i guess few problems jaime  brienne sword fight should have been way more badass as many people seem to also think  i never thought id be this guy but two episodes without much violence except the brief torture scenes of course actually seems to lose part of the grimness of the show  queen of thorns should have been funnier  i feel like they may be going in the direction of making joffrey too ridiculous was he getting turned on my marg wanting to kill things and big problem ive never been bothered by the acting in this show as in some actors may not be as enthralling as others but i never found anyone to be notably bad but the actress who plays sansa was terrible in the qot scene ehk i was a little confused by the apparently despised cat talking about jon scene  doesnt really make sense  but hey i dont mind them trying to make cat more likeable for the rw livin up to the got rep still lots of good things happy to see the reeds happy at the introduction of warging happy to see the boltons finally coming into the game and absolutely overjoyed at the brotherhood coming in at long last i was a bit sad that dondarrion didnt pop up but it can only mean that his entrance will be appropriately epic when it does happen"
"Alboin",2013-04-08,"voted 7 thats two points improvement since ep1  jojeen and meera are weirdly likeable and fun i liked qot herself didnt like how the scene was staged at all since it couldnt be as long as in the book writers and director had to invent some device to make sanda trust marg and qot they kinda skipped it liked whole arya sequence although i wish she would start to develop her badassoness more intensively  jon snow and sam stuff is still boring when you kill all the events because of budget you kinda have to invent other more cheaper events sam falling down for 5 minutes is not one of them theon at this point i sense 8 episodes of whining i guess they are heading towards shay being asansa savior over lf plot to abduct her she will convince tyrion to marry sansa to save her i donlike that one bit robb and karstark can rent a room cat and talisa scene came to us straight from days of our lives"

"TheEvilKing",2013-04-08,"gave it eight really solid if not spectacular episode that delivered in terms of both plot and character best parts  reeds introduction was great im not particularly a fan of them in the books but jojen in particular was excellent  lots of focus on house bolton  cats monologue was really good wonderful acting by michelle fairley and the claims of supposed character assassination have proved quite unfounded  queen of thorns and margaery are both brilliant  nice intro with the bwb and showed aryas fearlessness cant wait to see beric worst part  two eps and no sign of varys"
"Abaddon",2013-04-08,"moreover you literally have her taking the view that maybe this is all her fault those who are inclined to believe that either through latent misgoyny a lack of empathy or a preference for simplistic narratives are just going to latch onto it thats not what i think the writers expected but its what theyre going to getwell lets be fair here a lot of readers of the books hate catelyn i think thats bizarre personally and i know thats not what george intended but it hardly seems fair to blame the show for making many showonly viewers blame catelyn without acknowledging the book did the same thing albeit very differentlyat this point i dont really think of them as the same character and while i certainly wasnt a catelyn hater i didnt love her character either i wish they had stuck to the book catelyn and i dont know why they didnt but while its a shame there are other alterations that bother me a lot more jon  quorin at the top of the list edited by abaddon 08 april 2013  0929 am"

"Sword of the Morning Wood",2013-04-08,"liked  theons torture scenes hearing about it was pretty harrowing in the books and it looks like itll be the same on the show i loved the setting up of ramsey to fuck with theon  jamie and brienne i think theyve caught the dynamic between those two perfectly brienne was even caught having a wee look at jamies goods when he was taking a piss the fight was fine imo jamie still exudes danger even when hes in chains but i liked how they showed that brienne is good enough to overcome an out of shape kingslayer still in chains  i liked the introduction of the bob thoros was different to how i imagined but i liked it i thought they adapted that part of the story very well so far  sansaa meeting the marg and qot rigg was excellent and again i thought they caught the spirit of a fairly important scene very well soso  i thought the introducation of the reeds could have been better my only real problem is that it felt rushed and the explanation of green dreams and brans importance felt rushed given that its pretty important liked the casting though and this can all be fixed in the next few episodes  north of the wall they were just moving the story along scenes for me  marg and joff it was quite funny to see margarey wrapping joffrey round her little finger with all her double entendres i half expected jack gleeson to walk across the room john wayne style dindt like  robbs scenes i feel like robbs becoming more unlikable than he was in the books and in earlier series hes lost a bit of energy  cat and tulisa im not as opposed to the change in itself as some people just found the scene boring  shae and tyrion shaes already a well established character and their relationship is already well set up i found that scene unnessesary i suppose that makes it a 710 for me then im just itching to get past the setting up the story phase and get to the action"

"WinterWarrior",2013-04-08,"as an addendum to my previous post no one portrays the queen of thorns as well as roy dotrice does in the audiobooks even an actress as amazing as diana rigg who did an excellent job and is perfect for the role is not as good as roy dotrice in the audiobooks maybe they should have dressed him in drag for the role my not so humble opinion dotrice is a master"

"Stormcatcher",2013-04-09,"i loved this episode i think various scenes were adapted well from the books and the pacing seems good actually it got to some storylines earlier than i expected aryasandor and jaimebrienne i liked the bit with olenna margaery and sansa sansas actress was marvellous in that scene jaime and briennes scenes were just marvellous i really like how they captured the spirit of banter from the books the conversation with catelyn and whatsherface about jon snow was also interesting and i enjoyed seeing the reeds and the scene where sams about to give up but dolorous edd and forgottenhisname come back for him only thing i didnt like was the constant oh by the way renly was gay comments it wasnt very subtle with the references to camp gays is that even a stereotype in westeros especially adding bits like joffrey going im thinking of making homosexuality a crime there are already a multitude of reasons for hating joffrey we dont need to add attitudes to samesex relationships that westeros doesnt seem to have they find it funny and weird sure but not agh no kill them in the same way as medieval europe"

"Lucifer Lightbringer",2013-04-10,"so far i am not enjoying this season as much as the first two i can understand that they need to change a lot of things to adapt the novels to a ten hour tv season but some of the deviations seem unnecessary and fundamentally change characters or plot lines at this rate of deviation the entire series could end up being radically different from the books perhaps more importantly most of the scenes they do include do not live up to the potential of the material the worst thing to me is that there are so many things they could remain more faithful on if they just allowed a small amount of set up ahead of time but instead they have to have invented tit scenes thus they are always springing things into the story unannounced which diminishes the subtle relationships in the books and makes many things seem very clumsyfor clarification the things that i dislike most are the differences in the mechanics or behaviors of the world things like the powers of rhllor worshipers clairvoyance and skinchanging are crucial details that are barely glazed over or totally changed in the tv series ironically the things that i liked most in this episode were the invented scenes other than the horrible shaetyrion scene and catelyns descent into simpering idiocy and the things that continue to disappoint me are how the original scenes and plot lines are being interpreted here are things that i am disappointed aboutthe total change in characterization of berics outlaws in the books they are like pious merry men when they first meet arya with thoros being a reformed or born again priest in the service of rhllor i cant remember if they have mentioned berics special properties yet but his relationship to thoros and his somewhat unique condition are both extremely remarkable things that serve to validate the actions of rhllor worshipers and serve as an important pivot point in the story plus the selfperceived righteousness and religious tendencies of the outlaws are most of their motivation and set the stage for their darker turn further onthe sansa arc seems to be very sloppy and convoluted shae and tyrion dont need to be involved at all at this point and using baelish up front removes a lot of suspense and a chance for a good reveal later on it also makes him appear much much less cunning and forces an extra level of complexity because now we have to openly watch his plan come into place shaes involvement is unnecessary and ham fisted as is ros entire existencethe handling of brans and jons stories and their included elements of skinchanging and visions is pretty iffy its a little early to tell at this point but the fact that osha and rickon are still present reed implies that the three eyed crow is not a distinct thing and that the other stark children havent experienced their abilities all makes drastic variation seem more likely in the future this is really one of those things that could have been so easy to do but they just didnt how hard would it have been to show a couple of minutes of extra exposition on skinchanging even having jon kill orell wouldnt have been difficult and having a rogue eagle with a person trapped inside is a really cool detail also sixskins was a much cooler character than orell seems to be so farcatelyn robb and robbs wife  are god awful they dont think that bran and rickon are dead which was supposed to be the motivation for much of what they do including ultimately robbs marriage catelyn is less a stern bitter and tired matriarch and more a simpering superstitious idiot and her motivations are entirely differentim also pretty disappointed that there will be no goatlike the fist of the first men the fight between brienne and jaime was extremely anticlimactic and a hugely wasted opportunityhere are things that i likedi think that the margjoff scene was very well done and fleshes out each character in a way that the book couldnt have done because of pov joffs actor is excellent and i really like margs as well overall this was my favorite scene this episodei think the queen of thorns was well introduced though i wish she were more of a hamthe reeds were well cast even though the plotline they are a part of is miles off at this pointi think that aside from making thoros and the brotherhood completely unlike their book versions they did a good job of condensing aryas story by bringing in the hound early and cutting out so much of the travelingthe banter between brienne and jaime was well done even if it was out of character from their book versions and the resulting fight was totally lackluster"
"Joyful Union",2013-04-10,"the badjaime and briennes fight scene was slow their walking scenes were pretty arduous to watcharya being 100 inept with a sword and acting all a tremble where is our little spitfirethe boringthoross unburning swordi suppose that you didnt like any of the back and forth between j and b thenyou expect a little girl to do a well against a hardened champion fighter with an unfamiliar sword she hasnt trained withwhy would thoross sword be on fire"

"K1T",2013-04-10,"the fight between jaime and brenie wasnt convincing at all i mean they spend so much money on effects actors and accessories but cant make a proper duel scene except this even after i read all books i liked everything including boltons domination over everything in the episode"
"SwordInDaDarkness",2013-04-10,"i thought the cat scene was fine if you look at it from the point of view of someone who hasnt read the books its quite a nice story i understand that there is absolutely no obligation for cat to be motherly towards jon but i dont see how anything she said completely changes her character she hated jons existence so she prayed for him to be dead when it looks like hes going to die she felt guilty and makes a lot of promises to her gods that she couldnt keep she knows that jon does not deserve to be treated the way she treats him but did it anyway only because shes reminded of her husbands infidelity ill admit that the whole gods wrath thing was unnecessary but i dont see any problem with the story per se"
"boojam",2013-04-10,"the fight between jaime and brenie wasnt convincing at all i mean they spend so much money on effects actors and accessories but cant make a proper duel scene except this even after i read all books i liked everything including boltons domination over everything in the episodewell i knew that they had only so much time blocked out for each scene and it seemed to go on for about the length that episode could budgetin the book it was kind of engaging because even in chains jamie got the best of brienne for a long time until he realized he could not wear her down and then she rallied and got the best of him  well jamie was surprised in fact i got the impression even without chains and in the best of condition  in the book jamie had unexpectedly met his matchin the thick of the battle several time brienne might have killed jamie i dont think she wanted thatas i said i didnt think the sword play was lame but had heard that gwen has practiced for weeks and she and nikolaj had rehearsed it for about a week like i said i have no real complaints but expected a little more imagination in that scenein the book it was an important chemistry dynamic between the twolord  we have drawings of long sword fighting but i can never figure out how it really came off"
"DolorousKim",2013-04-10,"i agree with a lot of what you have written but it seems like lots of people think that rickon ran off for good with summer i didnt get that impression at all he just ran down a hill and bran sent summer to watch out for him i am sure we will see rickon and osha go off together soon now that the reeds are here they are awesomei didnt really express myself too clearly on this point i also dont think that rickon has run off forever but it seems to me that the reeds well jojen at any rate were in the books very very cautious regarding not meeting up with anyone who could later disclose the fact that the stark boys were still alive so it seems peculiar that they would just let little rickon arbitrarily run off by himself of course in the books rickon and osha didnt travel with the reeds hodor and bran and we have no idea how stealthy their approach was to traveling in the north but i still find it hard to believe that even osha would allow rickon free reign to wander off alone also im assuming that summer went with rickon and shaggydog in order for bran to be able to watch out for rickon via summer but it still strikes me as somewhat of a false note the books did a very good job of depicting how deep unique and mystical the bond was between each stark and their direwolf i dont think that the nonbookreading viewer is able to get any sense of the true nature of this bond thus far in the show and i feel that this is too important a point to be glossed over my nonbookreading husband for example thinks of the direwolves almost as pet dogs at this juncture"
"Original Username",2013-04-10,"i gave it a 7 about the same level as 3x01 felt the pacing was a bit off at the start of the episode a bit too much jumping around while not much was really happening liked pretty much all the new characters are cast perfectly hodor gendry  arya arguing about the three deaths tyrells brotherhood without banners didnt like tyrion  shae felt pointless and the acting was kind of off even with the dink catelyn  talisa scene i just did not care about not that i cared much about cat in the books either jaime  brienne duel was over too fast and bri won too easily didnt bother me as much when i watched the scene again though"

"brinson2000",2013-04-12,"910 much much better than the first episode for all those of you causing an uproar over the tyrionshae scene where the hell were you on the episode one discussion bronns scene with the stupid whore was just as long had no dialogue and showed no character development yet the scene was barely complained about on the board for episode one i think you people were just looking for something to complain about in this episode because it was actually really good even the tyrionshae scene served a purpose to show shaes possibility for jealously giving her motive for her actions in events later to come loved the orell scene even though it was very short giving a visual and verbal explanation for warging the reeds introduction was outstanding and i love the two characters i think at this point in the show situations have already been put into place where they cannot follow the storyline in the book ie the reeds never came to winterfell and met bran there so the show has to come up with their own scenarios for how to introduce characters and this was a great introduction i guess they are going to let osha stay along with bran the rest of the way instead of going with rickon which i was disappointed in but i would imagine natalia tena osha is one of the higher paid actors and they need to give her screen time to justify using her as osha so rickon had to go it alone the cateyln scene i didnt find nearly as bad as most people on here are saying yes her talking about john snow was out of the ordinary but the actingemotion porttrayed by michelle fairley is really what captured my attention there is a progression starting in her character towards a much more darkdowntroddenpissed off cat as opposed to the quietermore solemn cat from the first two seasons she is starting to show more anger and resentment than she ever has my point being that while watching this scene and not getting too overconcerned with her dialogue the whole time all i could think was i was watching lady stoneheart incarnate theons scenes now this is where the show can be better than the books it gives us a visual for theons torture scenes that the books could only explain as having been past events it allows us to see the emotions and horror theon goes through to become the character he will eventually be the sneaking in of ramsay was also excellent and sets up an awesome future scene for theon and his bitches sansalady olena 1010 nuff said"

"Lord Godric",2013-04-07,"3 what did you think of the treatment of homosexuality in the joffmargery scene which was excellent in my view joff says hes considering punishing homosexuality by death which seems a bit too onthenose and topical for me on the other hand grrm never explicitly explores what the religiousmoral position on homosexuality is in westeros reading the books i sort of get the idea that homosexuals are mocked not unlike how jaime mocks the late renly in this episode but not that they are considered abominations before the gods the way those who commit incest are its interesting to think abouti wasnt sure what to make of joffreys comments about homosexuality either it is a deviation from the books because i agree with you that homosexuality is something that is snickered at in the books but it never seems like an abomination or anything of the sorts there is also the explanation that it is just joffrey being joffrey clearly everyone knew about renly and loras and we never see anyone besides joffrey make a comment about being a degenerate its always a joke like jaimes iron throne of cocks or littlefingers when will you have your friend so for my own personal canon i think ill just interpret it as joffrey being himself"

could hardly breathe her worlds jumbled as the truth came tumbling unwanted out for hear that was masterful sansas struggle is about as good as i have seen it a complex story of how to survive a death sentencerhymes with technique keeping theon present so we can witness his absolute and tital desintigration is great i know that watching torture is horrible but it was placed perfectly here we see the depravity of the boltons and how to break a man down flap of skin by flap of skin i thought the decision to include theon in season 3 when he is mia in books 3 and 4 was great  it shows a good insight into continuity of story and keeping around the things that work well alfie is amazingto win it while i thought the scene went on far far far far far too long i really enjoyed how it ended since she first smoldered on stage margery tyrell has been a gigantic win for the series and what she did well in season 2 she improves upon in season 3 how to play men who want to play with you margery tyrell completely outmaneuvered and disarmed joff whose whole plan was to do just that to her and in her deft motions she turned joff away parried his clumsy shows and then emerged as the won holding the weapon she told him what she needed to disarm him and now shes the one in control in it to win itthe lion and the maid gotta love it when a plan comes together jaime and brienne are a great tandum two good actors a great outline from the books some great dialog and writing and you have 3 knockout scenes and it didnt hurt that swords were involved let loose the hound of war i like it when a story does not get bogged down in needless details or minutia getting the hound to arya that fast was great and you lose the utterly incomprehensible part of the books where somehow a northern man honor duty blah blah blah somehow justifies to arya why he cannot take her to robb his liege lord you get arya and sandor in a room together and the story takes care of itself good workwhat i am not sold onbrans dream storyline and the utter unlikeability of the reeds tied in the middle of this unwieldy episode and its utter lack of momentum was the okaywehavetoputbranonscreensoletsthroweverythingabouthisstoryintothepotrightnowbecauseitsobvioushesnotlittleanymore so we get thrown at us jojen reed more on him later and meera reed as these pompous arrogant little shits who basically have the run of the north is there any sense that they are talking to their liege lord i mean i am grateful that it only took the series 22 seasons to mention howland reed it took them 7 episodes to mentions stannis so but to introduce the reeds as basically a trumped up version of every duo we have ever seen jojens the brains of the outfit see and im the brawn  said every character from every bad 1930s gangster movie ever reeks of cliche and rudimentary thinking did they even bother to try to make it interestinghonorbale mention is it physically possible for the woman playing osha to keep her head straight and not look like shes carrying a 400 pound gorilla on her back at all times if it turns out she has scoliosis or something my apologies but it<U+0080><U+0099>s just annoyingwhy cant we just not like her in my mind cat stark doesnt like jon snow and for obvious reasons that include loyalty fear of a split in her house the potential death to her own children the affection of her husband and the cruelty of a war i have no qualms about that i accept it and think it helps make her a complete and full character so why does she have to be nice about it why did the writers have to come up with this terrible hollow vacant  story about how cat stark nurtured this son she never really loved back to life how she stayed up with him and prayed to the gods and blamed herself and yadda yadda yadda  why do we change storylines to make audiences like people more i know some people are saying that oh no the story actually makes you like her less thats not what i got what i got was that when push comes to shove cat will be there for jon snow that her hatred can be mended and that<U+0080><U+0099>s not what i ever got from her in the books and that  well before the season is out so to speak we have to keep cat likable shakes headi cant possibly go on in this sunny temperate day where its clearly not that cold out at all i didnt buy for a second that sam was that tired or it was that cold or hard or deadly if you are going to try to copypaste a scene from the books into the story for fucks sake make it seem like you didnt just tack it on at the end watching sam tarly fall to his knees and not go on is really really hard to swallow when its on a bright sunny day its clearly warm out hardly any mist coming off the breath of the actors the snow is melted down to the grass hint we got more snow in massachusetts in february than the wildings got this year apparently and everyone looks fine seriously that scene lacked depth setting atmosphere realism and soul in other words vacant i dont believe anyone was that tired on that trek never bought it for a second that it was that cold out again if you just want to play copypaste from book to show thats fine just make it seem like you gave a shithonorable mention though edds part and mormonts part were both really great i thought they saved an otherwise unwatchable scenewhat was just badi think it was sartre who said hell is watching shae i know i am a broken record at this point but alas the women playing shae cannot act i buy nothing she is saying and i know that makes me shallow and foolish but that would be bad enough why is she fucking talking what is she saying she feels the need to belittle tyrion tell us she has a good heart all the while telling us a whole bunch of poop we already know like nails on a blackboard only instead of nails it was dying puppies i mean fine let<U+0080><U+0099>s say i am wrong about her acting ability and i will say that maybe i just dont get her fine but tell me what she did in that scene that we could not have inferred already through prior acts actions and dialog that whole scene did not need to be here except that we need peter dinklidge or everyone will stop watching the show still vacantbut hey at least she talked about roz so that way we could be saved from that somehow you made me hate jojen reed more i didnt think it was possible in the books jojen suffers from alwaysrightitis basically it<U+0080><U+0099>s a character that is always right but nobody in the book can get their brain around this utterly obvious fact so he gets to be all superior and all and because nobody like that exists on the planet earth it always reminds me that <U+0080><U+009C>this is the part of the book that is unrealistic and reminds me i am reading a fantasy trope<U+0080><U+009D> and that was terrible and jojen remains one of the characters i do not enjoy reading thankfully though got did the books one better at least bookjojen could glide by on not being pompous and arrogant about it at least he never seemed to be thrilled with being able to hold knowledge over others heads but show jojen is just an insufferable shit that petulant smile that knowitall demeanor well done hbo you made my least liked character somehow less likableand you may have ruined meera as well but there may be time to salvage that wreckoverall this may have been the worst episode of the series an empty hollow episode with few things to make it stand out wasted time wasted opportunities and a whole bunch of why am i watching this now i could be wrong i think that sometimes the show sets itself up on the slow side for a big revealthen again"

"Mladen",2013-04-08,"ok great episode with some small flaws but nothing that would ruin the day as a guy who think that adaptation should remain loyal to source material but to bring something fresh i can say this episode made me thinking about my attitude towards it all changes in this episode were somewhat great on one level and yet so problematic on anotherbut let me first focus on great things sansa and qot scene was perfectly acted sophie and dame diana had done superb job in bringing one of the most memorable scenes of the series on the screen although i believe that tv olenna should be a bit harsher in tone of her comments something maggie smith hellen mirren and judi dench are well known for i am so in love with her looks and her portrayal on acting part we also have to give a credit to thomas brodiesangster man he is perfect jojen not the way i imagined him but this was one i think is genuinly great and lastly the most controversial michelle fairley as an actress she did a great job i will discuss the scene later and i have to say her pain made such impression on meand now scene by scene emotional beginning was something i really enjoyed bran was so lovely in this episode that i have no words for it introduction of jojen and later meera was done smoothly although i blame writers for exclusion of the most impressive vows in westeros now focusing on kl i have to admit all scenes are done brilliantly from cerseis loss of control to qot and sansa all the way to classic tyrion humor with a bit notch to book tyrion and margaery forshadowing purple wedding everything about kl storyarc in this episode was nicely done and i appreciate the absence of naked whores theons storyarc is part of something bigger and i cant wait to see the hunt and its consequences orell scene was fine but not too impressive and as for nw i have to say i am a bit disappointed on the use of i forbid you to die line so early but it wasnt something too badand now let start with controversies stark camp storyarc catelyn is a mother never forget that and her role in both the books and the show is to be a loving mother who does everything in her power for her children and perhaps mentioning jon was a bad idea and i hate that catelyn became significantly less grey and more white but in some way i love how her sorrow is overtaking her and the line i couldnt love motherless child as much as it is wrong and as someone said character suicide is one of the most heartbreaking moments and michelle pulled it with highest honors the thing i am confused is those news from winterfell and the fact that the scene perhaps just like in the books is toned down a bitalso aryas story very deftly executed especially sandoraryas meeting i would like to have seen aryas appeal to harwin to recognize her and her enjoyment when sandor is hunted but for obvious reasons they cut it and i understand it i love thoros but its not book thoros this thoros isnt some ruggedly drunken man who partied with robert this thoros is different occasionally funny especially concerning hot pie but also crashed aryas confidence and showed her how powerless she is in a way he taught her how much she has to learnfor the end this episode has a bit faster pace but i like the new recipe concentrating on less arcs in one episode than stuffing it all in one this episode wasnt perfect but it was one indeed great episode and having watched these 2 episodes i can tell we can expect much better season this year the one in which changes will work for the show and its characters and not against it edited by mladen 08 april 2013  0300 am"

"Warhawk137",2013-04-08,"what i find weird about the rickard karstark scene is i totally buy this dialog but what did robb say to it i dont know its not normal for someone to be told he made a huge mistake getting married to someone and have him just shrug about it seemed odd to me that we didnt at least get somethingi had no problem with that because i think robbs reaction to the statement may be conflicted  robb is smart enough to know objectively that his marriage could damage his cause even if he doesnt want to admit that so he says nothing because on one hand he wants his decision to be the right one and its still a decision thats seems right to him in his heart but on the other hand he probably knows he has no rational argument to present to richard karstark against what karstark saysit was quite a difference between bran last year and bran this year in looks and in his voice but i dont think itll be a problem the events in the tv show do not need to be as compressed as they appear in the books it doesnt need to be a story told across only three years  it can and will since they have aged a lot since the pilot feel like much more time is passing i personally would be much more upset if they sought to recast the rolesyeah i think the biggest issue is going to be in terms of how you reconcile filming with the particular scenes because you run into a problem where the actors will tend to age up between seasons but the characters may age up within a season based on the timeline tbh if anything i think they could do a better job signifying passage of time which is always a difficult thing to do in this form of media especially when there are multiple plot threads you cant just put a subtitle saying 3 months since we last saw this character and then go onto the next scene with one saying 1 month before that but 5 months since we last saw this characterjumbled unrelated thoughts1 was anyone disappointed they didnt have the dreadfort in the opening credits given that a couple scenes from episode 2 take place there i wanted to see how they would render that terrible place i liked the first glimpse of ramsay snow he looks the part2 ran quoted a critic who called one catelyns scenes in episode 2 character assassination was this referring to the scene where she admitted to praying for jon snows death when he was a baby i didnt mind that at all she always hated jon in the booksyet she has a conscience so her sin of praying for an innocent babes death has always gnawed at her i think it was moreorless true to the books perhaps the assassination was something else something i missed3 what did you think of the treatment of homosexuality in the joffmargery scene which was excellent in my view joff says hes considering punishing homosexuality by death which seems a bit too onthenose and topical for me on the other hand grrm never explicitly explores what the religiousmoral position on homosexuality is in westeros reading the books i sort of get the idea that homosexuals are mocked not unlike how jaime mocks the late renly in this episode but not that they are considered abominations before the gods the way those who commit incest are its interesting to think about1 might come up sooner or later if i recall correctly they dont always change the map the first episode a place appears in order to keep things slightly surprising i could be wrong though2 i really have no problem with that scene look tvcat is and has been at least to some extent different than bookcat and i think we have to accept that to a certain extent the question then becomes is tvcat a good character irrespective of the comparison with the book  is she an objectively good character on her own i wasnt sure about it before but i actually think that the scene in question is a positive development because now theyre starting to make a clear statement as to who tvcat is in any case i think that tvcat still moreorless follows the spirit of bookcat and i think were largely going to end up in the same places with most of these characters  i dont think minor tweaks to motivations and backgrounds really hurt anything this is not to say that i dont think comparisons with the books are valid because its absolutely fine to compare differences maybe discuss how things might have been adapted better i just think its a bit shortsighted to use the level of strict adherence to the books as a proxy for quality3 explaning in rational terms anything joffrey does is a futile exercise plus that scene does quite nicely in showing joffs hypocrisy when you consider his own proclivities degenerate eh nice choice of words thereahh but loras is no jaimeand jaime is no barristan look ive got all the respect in the world for jaimes combat prowess but i do think the fans tend to overstate it somewhat hes among the best to be sure but hes not some unstoppable force and factoring in that he wasnt at his best its not all that surprising brienne got the upper hand there not to mention that jaime started out pretty hot in that fight and brienne basically let him wear himself out which is certainly the proper strategy against someone whos been held captive for quite some time and probably lacks for endurance edited by warhawk137 08 april 2013  0839 am"

"David Selig",2013-04-08,"of course it adds something to cats character just read some nonreader reviews and youll probably find a few that even whishes that this scene was in the last season so they could have had more sympathy for her when she released jaime because they felt that the scene put her in a new light it for examples explains her scene with jon for the first time adding more sympathy is also a pretty crucial thing to do to her in this season for very obvious reasons to everyone reading a book spoiler thread it might not add things that were in the book but thats a completely different thing i am frankly at a loss why this scene makes catelyn looks more sympathetic its revealed she prayed for the death of a baby and later on didnt make good on a serious promise to the gods even though shes very religious yes she feels bad about this now but so what"
"DisraeliGears",2013-04-08,"1 we already knew thishelps to be reminded occasionally when you consider the fact that especially in the show cat is the only good mother figure we really see and most of the parental figures are dead anyhow it becomes very easy to forget about her dislike of jon2 no it doesnt and it also isnt actually truethat is one of the major currents of the speech as a whole basically cat was lamenting that one reason for all this tragedy befalling her family is that she broke her oath to the gods to accept jon cat is essentially saying that if accepting jon as a stark would bring back ned arya sansa bran and rickon shed do it and she regrets not doing so honestly it shows the motherly side of cat more willing to sacrifice her own feelings about jonneds infidelity to keep her family intact finally it emphasizes cats losses so far cat was unwilling to love a motherless child but she can see soon that she may very well be a childless mother considering every stark aside from robb could be dead and robb has her locked up 3 what evidence of there is this we know sansa wouldnt call him her brother he couldnt sit with the family at feasts even his best friend robb made it clear he wasnt a legitimate stark this is a totally false statementnot gonna get into this one as jons bastard status does seem to be held against him numerous times4 in the book she hates jon for what he represents in the show she tells him she wishes he was hurt instead of bran and that she wished for him to die again as a young boy it doesnt make her sympathetic at all what does make her sympathetic in the books is how her love for eddard and her family overshadows her opinion of who jon is a fine young man because of what he represents and means to her and eddards relationshipthat is exactly what this speech is supposed to emphasize it just seems that people who interpret long fantasy novels cant interpret tv scenes this whole speech was basically i love my family more than i hate jon and if i could go back and redo things i would final comment about cat i hear a lot of complaining that she only thinks branrickon are dead instead of knowing it like the books and how that damages her character i can virtually promise you that she will find out about their death sometime in episode 5 or 6 probably im sorry but every ep is gonna check in with catrobb and 7 episodes of cat moping over their death would be extremely tiring which is why dd are holding it back cat is going to lose everything and it will have more resonance if it happens closer to the rw"

"DisraeliGears",2013-04-08,"im also surprised by the immense shae hate i see here because the actress really brings something to the role part of the problem i think people have with her is the odd cadence she uses but it helps emphasize the exotic nature of shae and is probably part of the reason tyrion falls for her unlike numerous other foreign characters who may as well be westerosi in the show talisa or thoros for example there is a definite sense of otherness with shae in fact comparing shae with talisa shows exactly why shae is a good character in the show while talisa is one of the biggest missteps in the adaptationbasically shae and talisa are flipped from the books in the books shae is a onenote gold digger who somehow takes in tyrion while in the show talisa is a onenote romantic love character in the books the shae character detracts from tyrion because a he shouldnt fall for that kind of thing and b why does it affect him so much during dance i dont buy how hung up he is in the books over a golddigger but i do buy him being so hung up over this shae characters betrayal however it happenson the other end of the spectrum the jeyne character adds to robb in the book showing he has the same flaw as his father his honor in the show however her substitute talisa really dumbs down his characterization into a simple doomed love story kind of thingi understand why dd decided to emphasize shae over jeynetalisa tyrion is much more important long run than robb basically so if you have to pick which one is going to be more fleshed out it ought to be tyrion but it still majorly damages robbs characterso can someone explain to me why the show shae is so terrible aside from bad acting the worst part about show shae is that the actress doesnt sell her connection to sansa all that well but her connection with tyrion is much more important and in that respect she does a fine job showing why she isnt just another whore to tyrionbut its more sympathetic not to have serious flaws and make serious mistakes than to feel regret over them right so logically if cat never prayed for jons death and never broken her promise to the gods she shouldbe more sympatheticum no having no serious flaws makes your character alien and unrelatable one crucial piece to being sympathetic is being human and being human means making mistakes edited by disraeligears 08 april 2013  0101 pm"

"Ser Greguh",2013-04-08,"actually not so she has done a lot of stupid things which have caused this war the war is more on her than almost any other character and she did all this out of love for her children but she cant face that thousands are dying and many more thousands will die because of her impulsive decisions it is easier for her to boil it all down to something simple like not loving jon i think this scene demonstrates how deluded cat is about her role in the larger story it also gives us a little insight into her interior battles re jon people often think something relatively trivial they did is the cause for their tragedies when it was some other flaw which lead to the tragedy this is because we cant see our true flaws most of the time i do not think it makes sense to think she knows about jons true parentage all of her other emotional conflicts dont make sense if that is the case ned kept the secret because too many lives were at stake had he not ned probably realized that cat was as impulsive as we see her in the books when they were first married therefore he knew she couldnt be trusted to share the big secretum no this is kind of insane really first off the only action that can realistically be laid at catelyns doing that helped cause the war was her kidnapping of tyrion the degree to which that was a true seminal moment versus an action that sped up the inevitable is debatable littlefinger was plotting to cause chaos in any case and had already set the starks and lannisters at each others throats via the killing of jon arryn and the letter sent to catelyn cersei was already plotting against robert and tywin lannisters reaction to tyrions arrest while possibly predictable wasnt lawful his son is accused of an assassination attempt and so quite naturally he launches a fucking invasion of the riverlands in responsejons cover was strengthened by cats dislike of himthis much i agree with if rlj neds cover story to protect jon from roberts wrath is quite flimsy and only really held in place because nobody has bothered inuniverse to ask the right questions catelyns enmity lends credance to the story"

"DisraeliGears",2013-04-08,"the idea of creating a street smart prostitute that might have more in common with tyrion isnt on the surface a bad idea but shae on the show is a complete cipher even after 13 episodes do we have any single idea what motivates this character why does she care about sansa why is she constantly putting herself at risk helping sansa continuing to see tyrion etc if she loves tyrion  why what was that out of the blue sudden bout of jealousy she had which she promptly forgot and then gave tyrion a blowjob what the hell that isnt a character a human being its a body filling up space and making noiseyou say she has a connection to tyrion what is the connectionshe felt bad for how he was treated as a kid we need something anything to understand where she is coming fromthe character is horribly underwritten if shae isnt the onenote gold digger give us a scene a line of dialouge something that hints at her motivations aspirations or feelings of couse that will require some acting and the actress isnt helping matters at all in that regardputting aside the sansa stuff isnt the fact that shae is a cipher the reason tyrion finds her so interesting she is one of the few people along with varys most likely that tyrion cant see through if he could then shed be just another whore at some point before the end of the shaetyrion plot i expect well get an idea what motivates her but for now tyrion is continually kept intrigued by actions and loyalty to him that he cant understand the jealousy bout has a few angles but is impossible to fully decipher at this point first it could be sowing the seeds for the tyrionshae falling out over sansa it could very well be shae simply teasing tyrion which she has done before though not in that specific way or it could also be shae keeping tyrion off balance which is one of the reason he is so fascinated by herthe sansa stuff id need to rewatch a couple s2 episodes to really interpret well though so im going to avoid getting into that for the moment and it really is less important anyhow"

"total1402",2013-04-09,"bit torn on this one but then again it does mainly concern characters ive less interest in and were still setting things up  sansa and olenna i quite liked that scene and i actually thought olenna was pretty true to the character however i felt it was bizarre that sansa mentioned being shown her fathers head and not he had his kingsguard strip and beat me in the middle of court whilst he pointed a crossbow at my head that kind of seems a lot more direct and to the point  theon i think the actor and the setting really captures just how terrible a fate is in store for theon the whole ruse about whose got him is a little bad since i ve read the books and it seems a touch bizarre since theyre asking him questions they shouldnt care about unless their goal is sadism in which case i find the absence of a certain character telling i would have preferred to have ramsey introduced then rather than maintain that ruse also its pretty clear that yaras man is just a dupe to get theon hunted down by ramsey and recaptured but yeah the bolton men dressing as ironborn feels really forced since its pretty obvious who burnt winterfell given that we saw the ironborn leaving  jamie and brienne  pretty funny and i was really surprised how much renly is brought up in all the different scenes for the characters this episode in general their fight maybe went on a little longer than it should though and the two swords thing was more than a little ehh arya i loved gendry being such a lad and bitching about arya not using jaqens deaths thank you so much the brotherhood certainly seemed colourful as did thoros i didnt like how the hound recognised arya and not the other way around like in the books in that she runs up and screams you killed mica at which the hound is shocked to see her this establishes her hatred and desire to see the hound dead from the beginning plus his shock is quite funny in the book in the show hes sort of like oh its you and that just isnt good cerseimargeryjoffrey these were quite good scenes showing the really tense relationship between them as joffery is woefully ignorant of the need to win margery over and his mothers warning clearly foreshadows things ironically we also almost see margery try to see how things work in private and they even seem to enjoy talking about the crossbow even if it only demonstrates further his psychopathic tendencies so margery is finding this out for herself joffery also emphasises that intelligent women do what they are told as a quip at cersei and represents her insecurities over position which are important this series and her behavior in affc as well in fact i quite like that theyre setting up the cersei vs margery thing early on cat this didnt really bother me the way it has for some the bit where she talks about jon seems pretty plausable for the character to have done her saying that this is the source of all their woes is a touch odd language to use i dont see how legitimising jon would have prevented ned being dead or winterfell falling overall this was a very slow episode which was mainly about finishing off introducing all of the other characters and continuing to set the stage this is something which is irritating because for a tv series you mainly just want to be able to roll through successive seasons without these slow starts where we introduce all the new characters across a dozen seperate ministories again by introducing the hound to arya and getting briennejamie captured theyre actually a good chunk through several character arcs i do hope things pick up from here though"

"protar",2013-04-10,"ok so bad acting not going to try and argue that point because it will simply go in circles i believe shes doing a good job distinguishing shae from a common whore or even an uncommon whore like rosfair enough agree to disagreeyes how silly in a world where people are commonly killed where the king slaughters innocent babes where thousands of men are burnt to death in a single battle that tyrion would get so hung up over killing a whore he rather liked instead of his father lets say in the books shae doesnt make a sufficient impact that a character so supposedly smart as tyrion should get caught up with her this shae adds enough depth for it to be believable so that in season 4 and onward when he has issues with love and women itll be believable thats why we get so much shae material why shes so important more so than jeynetalisa and why the actress is actually doing something with what was a one note character in the booksim sorry but youre just missing the subtleties of tyrions character plain and simple hes smart about books stupid about women lots of people are like that im like that it is in no way unrealistickilling shae in the books affects tyrion so much because1 his personal kill count isnt that high prior to this hes only directly killed people in battle when his life depended on it2 he was in love with shae the fact that she was a whore all along and didnt love him makes it all the more tragic to meequally worse is laughable and shae gets much more screen time it is a matter of choice you get 550 minutes for a season how to allocate those minutes are crucialshae gets more screentime yes but my point is that both could have been written much better in the time they gotso tyrions major flaw is that he gets fucked over by women guess what thats not a character flaw if he was too obsessed with women then itd be a character flaw but really shae is the only woman aside from his first whore yadda yadda hes developed a weakness for indeed shae keeps him on the straight and narrow rather well tyrions flaw is hubris in his own intellectual talent he thinks he plays the game better than he does which gets him screwed over imprisoned and exiled to essos because he believes in his own intellectual superiority he continues to indulge shae as she is the only person he doesnt understand you are still assuming that shae is entirely genuine and wont turn away from tyrion really if she was genuine and turned away it would be even more emotionally wrenching while i wont saying i know what dd are doing exactly i understand how their approaching this and they are doing an excellent jobtyrions flaw ruining things for himself because he has an unhealthy relationship with women he also displays intellectual hubris because guess what characters can have multiple flawstyrion is not necessarily obsessed with women in that he cant keep it in his pants hes obsessed because he lost the love of his life early on and is looking to fill that void he uses prostitutes for that but once he believes hes found love again hes entirely monogamousreally his musings on her in the book could be read as him still not understanding her motivations hes not so much torn up weeping about his lost love as thinking why i dont understand why she did this and im usually so good at understanding everything why does a whore do what she doeswhich again is part of the entire dynamic they have its not the entire thingbottom line is that dd have vastly simplified what was a very complex and messy relationship into a stereotypical tragic love story the nuance has been lost imo"

"ebevan91",2013-04-07,"i didnt mind the scene i think the scene was there to set up the legitimization of jon and robb naming him his heir also jon snow is one of the most beloved characters on the show so maybe viewers will start liking catelyn more so the rw will be more devastating edited by ebevan91 07 april 2013  0957 pm"

"Bastard of Boston",2013-04-07,"its a different tone of cat than the book ever utilizes and in that sense yes its a departure i think the accusations of character assassination are a little drastic though she wished he was dead he almost died she felt guilt over it and promised shed do better  she never didcue more guilt it sounds like the ups and downs of a complicated relationship hate is a tricky thing some days you feel entitled to it and others you wonder if youre the assholei just read rans review of the episode and he notes the idea that cat would ever fathom a mothering role with jon is the real problem forgive me if im missing the point while i always eagerly anticipate and value westeros reviews above anyone elses i still dont see a problem i think cat promising to be the mother jon never had was akin to making any other number of grandiose promises when in a fit of guilt its just the lengths we go to in those moments at the end of the day cat never followed through on any of her promises and i think thats the point we all go to different extremes in fits of hatred and guilt but when those fits are over we all tend to nestle back into our comfort zone and for cat she never had any wantneed nor did she ever feel any obligation to mother jon  it was just words a guiltstricken girl said to appease her godshe has no mother i will be his mother just dont take him"

"Rouge et Bleu",2013-04-08,"my initial reaction when she said jon snow was all like wtf however the more i thought about the scene and rewatched it several times the more i enjoyed it at the end of the monologue it still came back to her being unable to love jon because she wasnt his true mother and represented neds greatest act of infidelity to her i agree with several other posters on this thread who commented upon the extreme thoughts we often have in moments of overwhelming guilt  anguish  anger cat made a promise in a moment of guilt and it was one that deep down she probably knew that she could never fulfill this was not a character assassination by any stretch of the imagination it was an insight into cats emotions at the absurdity that has befallen her family since ned became the kings hand and a sense of shame at her own actions nobody can hate a child for their entire existence and there had to have been moments in book cats life where she questioned her feelings towards jon i think that this brought those unspoken moments to life also as many astute posters have already pointed out this was a great moment of possible foreshadowing for the series ala jons potential legitimization by robb and inducing sympathy for cat prerw plus the scene was incredibly well acted edited by rouge et bleu 08 april 2013  1207 am"

"kingkiller",2013-04-08,"i think its a bit ridiculous to assume that throughout the 1516 probably more in the show years that jon snow lived at winterfell that cat never felt sorry for him once ever hear the expression i wouldnt wish that on my worst enemy well that is all this scene is really portraying cat as a mother felt sympathy for a sick and dying boy with no mother if you feel like that betrays who cat is then i dont know what to tell you all the stuff about being a mother to him and making him a stark well obviously that was all fantasy since she went right back to hating him once he got better are you telling me that you guys have never considered making a conscious effort to change your attitude towards a person just seems to me that a lot of supposed cat lovers would rather have her relationship with jon remain a onenote unwarranted hatred rather than something she actually does feel guilty about"
"JonCon's Red Beard",2013-04-08,"i think its a bit ridiculous to assume that throughout the 1516 probably more in the show years that jon snow lived at winterfell that cat never felt sorry for him onceshe did ask ned about him i doubt it was just plain curiosity about the mother had ned said something like yes i felt tempted by some woman and jon is the consequence maybe cat could have been a bit more accepting or at least less resented towards the kid it was neds stark  npi  answer that completely killed any intention of caring for the child as far as young and newlywed cat knew ned brought him home because he reminded him of his only true love or the mother was still alive and ned was just taking care of jon until the time they got together again"
"Haymaker",2013-04-08,"have no problem what so ever with this scene and liked it i think it actually adds to the character in real life we would equate this emotion as catholic guilt and it works perfectly with the religion cat follows which is equated to christianity basically i personally dont think shes all that different from book cat shes just not as fleshed out as in the books due to time leading to shortcuts taken in her story disclaimer i was never a big fan of catelyn in the books to begin with so maybe thats why i dont get the hate toward tv cat and especially this scene"
"Lily Valley",2013-04-08,"i appreciated this scene like all of the ones we have gotten from margaery the scene breaks to the wall and then a mirror of the pilot with bran trying to shoot an arrow and all of his brothers there with jojens first appearance this is really good editing i dont think this is an accidentthis is cats whole relationship with john in a nutshell and a curse on the starks ala hollywood but still good data"
"kingkiller",2013-04-08,"she did ask ned about him i doubt it was just plain curiosity about the mother had ned said something like yes i felt tempted by some woman and jon is the consequence maybe cat could have been a bit more accepting or at least less resented towards the kid it was neds stark  npi  answer that completely killed any intention of caring for the child as far as young and newlywed cat knew ned brought him home because he reminded him of his only true love or the mother was still alive and ned was just taking care of jon until the time they got together againcat having those fears early in their marriage totally makes sense but ned proved to her time and time again that he was true to her she still took it out on jon and not ned i mean im sure there were nights where she might have told ned im too tired or to go sleep in the godswood because of him being good to jon but for the most part she completely got over neds infidelity it was a nonfactor in their marriage any fears she had early on turned to dust yet she still hated jon its not fair that she forgave ned but hates jon for something he had no part in and she knows it"
"bluemoon",2013-04-08,"didnt bother me but i dont seem to get as upset about changes as some dothis "
"Faint",2013-04-08,"my first thought as i was watching the scene was how this would affect the future scene concerning robbs will provided they include it in the show will catelyn still be opposed"
"JonCon's Red Beard",2013-04-08,"cat having those fears early in their marriage totally makes sense but ned proved to her time and time again that he was true to her she still took it out on jon and not ned i mean im sure there were nights where she might have told ned im too tired or to go sleep in the godswood because of him being good to jon but for the most part she completely got over neds infidelity it was a nonfactor in their marriage any fears she had early on turned to dust yet she still hated jon its not fair that she forgave ned but hates jon for something he had no part in and she knows iti understand but its easier to forgive ned as he as you said proved himself to never fall again while all her negativity was targeted towards jon who was a walking reminder of what ned didi think its not only that though one of jons memories of his childhood is to have innocently hinted that he was lord of winterfell and robb saying he would never be because hes a bastard they were about five years old so cats mind was maybe still worried about jon being a threat to robbs claim even when there is nothing for her to fear or it was cats way to remind young jon that although ned treated him like a legitimate son he wasnt nor would ever be this i can understand i can understand cat not wanting to share what belongs to her natural children with some boy she had no idea where he came from specially if at some point ned could have casually mentioned to legitimize himalso this is in the app but it says that cat and robb arrived winterfell after ned and jon i can imagine cat being all exited about showing ned their son for the first time while ned was already there with a baby who looked more like him than his legitimate son lets use a bit our imagination ned orders that the kid should be treated like hes a stark everybody gets crazy with a baby who probably was a minined and cat arrives with a baby who is a tully people talk and make awkward comments or remarks"
"Xerox in 4 Parts",2013-04-08,"its not character assassination but it wasnt a good scene either catelyn did wish jon dead in the books but in an atypically stressful moment the show made it seem like she wanted jon dead all the time which just sounds like fanboy hyperbole also the books never make catelyn apologize all that much for her inability to accept much less be a mother to jon this is because martin fundamentally believes that catelyn was put in unfair situation even if she didnt handle it perfectly and her refusal to let go of her anger is much like sansas refusal to kneel at her wedding why should she when nobody cares about her feelings the show makes no acknowledgment about how the situation was unfair to catelyn and how that informs her anger the show thinks its just about catelyn being a jealous insecure little wife and doesnt ever acknowledge that most women in westeros are not even asked by their husbands to raise their illegitimate children in the first place the shows mo is if shes humble enough then boys will like her im not here for that for all the good things the show does its handling of catelyn stark is not one of them"
"TomBadgerlock",2013-04-08,"it was awful its obvious why they did it with robbs legitimising of jon to follow but wow it was a mess as far as im concerned the scene with robb  jon in s1e2 was all they needed as foreshadowing leading up to robb legitimising him we saw for a brief moment how close they were"
"Delmas",2013-04-08,"i enjoyed the scene much better than the shae scene"
"Myrish Swamp Thing",2013-04-08,"definitely enjoyed the scene it wasnt nearly as bad as people feared i think people are carrying their bookcat prejudices to the show and seeking validation from it"
"lannistergold",2013-04-08,"i watched it and knew it would cause outrage but i had no problem with it at all im a catelyn fan i understand her hatred and treatment of jon but dont condone it obviously this scene just seemed to fill in one page of their long history together catelyn still hated jon after this but had a moment of weakness we see her regretting what she said to jon later in got so i dont think its unreasonable or out of character for her to have had previous moments of weakness with jonqftif cat had nothing but contempt for jon it would reflect badly on her even the relatively good characters have character flaws of course but this is one that rankled a lot of fans clarifying that she had some compassion for him is something id always wanted tbh and it doesnt feel like a divergence from the character as martin imagined her shes pretty highminded even if she has some understandable chips on her shoulder"
"JMJ",2013-04-08,"i had no problem with how cat was portrayed i think its in line with cats persona in the books however the problem i had was talisa first she comes off as a headstrong modernminded woman who is robbs equal when they meet now shes a meek daughterinlaw afraid to offend cat i never liked the talisajeyne changeup ill admit but at least keep the character consistent"
"metr0man",2013-04-08,"im pretty sure this scene exists at least in part to plant the idea that jon snow could be legitimized as a stark considering the writers met with grrm during the hiatus to find out where the story was going so they could start setting up character arcsthreads it is curious"
"Keep Shelly in Athens",2013-04-08,"cat seems way too hard on herself the dialogue would have worked better in neds cell back in season 1 something similar but with ned thinking about how his actions have brought ruin on his house in other words it seems like cats regret in this scene should really have been neds eg regret at putting cat in a difficult situation keeping jon at arms length ect all because i couldnt love a motherless child sounds very maudlin geez cat youll run yourself ragged if you think that you have to be a mom to all the orphans in the world motherhood isnt a always a labor of love sometimes its just labor"
"Honey Badger",2013-04-08,"i didnt like the pox story as cat could have just delivered the it should have been you line when jon visited bran now theres a bit of back tracking to cover the dynamic her blaming herself for house stark makes sense shes religious and thinks theres a karmic price that the starks are paying because she couldnt love fine even in the books i blame her for most of house starks problems anyways she touched off most of the drama by going after the lannisters while the murder plot with lady arynn was started by littlefinger"
"Tall Tyrion Lannister!",2013-04-08,"i had no problem with the scene"
"lannistergold",2013-04-08,"her blaming herself for house stark makes sense shes religious and thinks theres a karmic price that the starks are paying because she couldnt love finei think this was the one part of the exchange that was a bum note for me but while it seems awfully melodramatic it might be consistent with her belief system assuming that her gods punish malicious prayers and oathbreaking as many would otherwise the whole scene felt right to me i can see myself going through the same thought process in her shoes because im a guy of course that takes quite an act of imagination"
"iYT",2013-04-08,"what the crap was my initial thought when cat reveled the second son was jon snow but as she continued it was a return to normalcy for me i do enjoy disliking her as much as i enjoy liking daenerys and arya as far as the changes from book to tv seriesmovie go although they may be disappointingpleasant surprise at times i have always tried to view them as a retelling of a retelling while the book is the original account the showsmovies are similar to stories handed down orally allowing minor characters to be added or taken out and have their story arcs changed to the story tellers liking the producers have done a good job with this story in getting it out to those of us that had not read the books and creating a desire to know the original storyimo"
"Mr Smith",2013-04-08,"i think i might be the first book fan to say this but i really enjoyed it does it really hurt giving cat a bit of guilt about jon i think it humanises her more and adds a lot more depth to the way she treated jon in the few scenes we saw them together and we know shes a religious woman so why not make her feel like her tragedies are punishment from the gods the speculation about it being relevant to future plot developments that we dont know about but martin and the writers do is also valid"

"Raksha the Demon",2013-04-08,"i agree the scene did not bother me at all except for catelyn feeling guilt about her arrogance that seems out of character for herits a bit of a stretch but catelyns speech did not bother me as much as some of the other booktotv changes  such as the existence of talisa and her becoming robbs wife or sansas refusing to go with the hound because kings landing was her home now rather than the hound being an unstable drunk who held a knife to her neck or ros being a supporting character who is now littlefingers executive assistant or whateverim looking forward to catelyns return to riverrun"
"Tenlaar",2013-04-08,"im another book reader who liked the scene ill even go so far as to admit that it was something about book cats character that i really didnt like she was a practical just devout caring woman it never sat well with me that she would have a burning lifelong hatred of somebody over something that they had absolutely no control over as others have said you cant believe that she absolutely hated jon every moment of his life she prayed for his death out of anger he came close to death she prayed for his salvation out of guilt i think that displaying conflicted emotions if even for a night was good to me it showed that she knew in her heart that jon had never done anything to deserve her treatment of him but her head wouldnt allow her to change it and i think it was about the only deviation from book cat that improved her character in a way"
"Dicer",2013-04-08,"werent some people in the books shocked that jon snow was allowed to eat with the family thats why i mentioned thati dont remember this in the one scene that we got in agot benjen stark asks jon why he is sitting at the lower tables and not with the family at the feast held for robert and jon says that cat did not want to insult the royals by seating a bastard with them and later he uses that excuse to join mance raydar and the wildlings other than that i cant recall anything special made of jon eating at the table with the rest of the starks ned brought up jon in the same manner as the rest of his kidsi did not have any issues with the cat monologue in this episode i think its more about her faith than jon it may have added some layers to the character but i still think it was unnecessary and they could have used this screen time elsewhere"

"KoishNoish",2013-04-08,"to be honest i was ok with this scene it felt a little out of place but i could run with it i think the point is to bring through that cat is someone who cares a lot for all her children even jon snow a very little bit so then when lady stoneheart comes much later it will seem all the greater"
"Dicer",2013-04-08,"i dont think she treated jon like garbage but yeah she hated him if she was indifferent towards him she would not have cared if jon stayed at wf or not but she was absolutely insistent that jon leave along with ned and would rather prefer some distant lord in the vale get wf than neds own son i would say she was indifferent towards theon but that she hated jon which is understandable considering he looked like ned was a reminder of neds infidelity and could be a threat to her childrens inheritance i can understand her hatred but i cant justify her hating a kid for no fault of his own i dont see anything wrong in knowing that she could show some love and kindness to a motherless child when he was sick nothing wrong with that and its far from character assassination edited by dicer 08 april 2013  0453 am"

"KhalFrodo",2013-04-08,"thought it was good i had more of a problem with the shae and tyrion scene reallythis i thought this was the best scene cat has had in the series thus far the shae and tyrion scene isnt really a good thing for their story arc i really dont know how theyre going to pull off the plot line between those two if they stay on this path of building shae into a hooker with a heart of gold its been suggested that they may replace tyrions exwife with shae in the showi still think this season has been leaps and bounds better than last season thus far and hope they keep on this path they tied up some slipups from last season robb is headed to riverrun and bolton is in harrenhall jaime back in captivity while also cutting out some unneccessary story barristan as arstan hopefully they stay on this apparent attempt to reconnect with the source material"
"Archana The Brown Walker",2013-04-08,"edit im quoting francis buck from another thread because i think its interestingcatelyns story about jon wasweird it doesnt bother me necessarily but it was definitely a strange addition its one of those instances like danys vision of the iron throne destroyed and covered in snow where i feel like the showrunners know important things about the end of the series and thus are purposely foreshadowing events that the book readers could have no inkling to i really dont think they just make up random shit like that for the sake of it though thats how many book readers seem to feelshowrunners were stating the obvious with iron throne destroyed and covered in snow except for the fact that maybe dany will return to westeros if she does return westeros will be deep into winter and possibly in the middle of the long night v20 by the time she reaches kings landing"

"Pugsley",2013-04-08,"i took this scene to be more about cats relationship with the seven than her relationship with jon she feels the gods are punishing her for breaking a promise she made to them i think when a series of tragic things happens its natural for a person as religious as cat to ask why their god is punishing them in her case this may be the only time where she essentially bargained with the gods  to relieve her guilt at wishing a child dead not out of a sudden wave of compassion  and then reneged on her promise to them once she got what she had prayed for i dont think this scene in any way implies that her life is defined by her relationship with jon i do think her religious devotion is an important aspect of her character however for that reason i wasnt bothered by this scene at all in fact i found it quite emotional"
"Warrior Queen",2013-04-08,"i though it was a good scene it made cat more likeable i hate her in the book and this made me like her a little better imo it makes her more like a real person except the fact that she states that she would beg ned to give jon the stark name jon could be older than robb they are born in the same year and this would make him then heir to winterfell very unlikely that she would want him to be legitimized i like the fact that she basically says that she tried to love a motherless child but just couldnt do it it made her more real in the books she is just a overly religious woman that hates a little baby for reasons he cant change in the show she at least tried to love him edited by warrior queen 08 april 2013  0742 am"

"Mother of Mini Dragons",2013-04-08,"i really liked this scene partially because michelle fairley is so excellent as cat i felt the emotion and i thought it was a chance to depict cats guilt towards jon which you only get a glimpse of in the books and only because shes a pov character it also reveals cats relationship with the seven gods which is important because her faith is such an essential part of her character as well i found it to be a very moving scene i think cat gets a lot of grief but people continually forget what a state of depression and sadness she is in throughout the series edited by mother of mini dragons 08 april 2013  0745 am"

"Ran",2013-04-08,"flowand regardless of whether or not ned could have done things differently doesnt justify book catelyns actions towards jonoutside of brans bedchamber incident there were no catelyns actions towards jon winterfells a big place and she had no reason or desire to interact with him no more than random guardsman 2 had to go out of their way to hang out with him if they didnt feel like itits ned who creates the expectation in jon that maybe catelyn should act like a mother to him perhaps but thats on nedthats not saying she needed to treat jon as well as if he were her natural born son but some of her cruelty towards him was rather nonseven likeshe was never cruel to him outside of that said incident edited by ran 08 april 2013  0819 am"

"Ran",2013-04-08,"the problem is that she says only a mother can make one of those things for her child ergo she understands that she has an obligation to jon as his stepmother this makes her a bad mother in an objective way in the novels she has no such obligation she isnt his mother or stepmother and judgments of her do not rest on the notion that she bore that sort of obligation edited by ran 08 april 2013  0821 am"

"Tywin's bastard",2013-04-08,"i dont think its quite as much of a deviation from the character as the westeros analysis said i think that analysis put a bit too much emphasis on catelyn disliking jon while i personally think her dislike for him is in a significant part misdirected anger towards what he becomes a representation of as for the obligation to him i see it as more of a moral thing as she came to love ned and in order to accept him fully family and duty she somewhere feels that she should accept his choice with jon naming him a stark might be a bit much since that affects her children through laws but when just looking at the sentiment i think you can draw conclusions that stay a little bit closer to the original"

"freetickles",2013-04-08,"i thought this scene was great most of the critiques seem to center around the idea that as ran said in his review cat does not have a social or moral obligation to be his mother under the norms of westerosi culture so what as much as we all love asoiaf westeros is not a real place and its culture was invented entirely by grrm this show is not historical fiction and it isnt the bible that its trying to recreate it may be that some westerosi customs arent absolutely necessary to be translated to the tv show when the show deviates from the books in a way that wouldnt quite work in the books from what we know of the books it doesnt mean its inconsistent within the show and therefore isnt necessarily a problem in this case the change doesnt detract from the story whatsoever and if the viewer doesnt understand that cat doesnt have an obligation to jon snow this doesnt hurt her character if anything a viewer that doesnt completely understand the laws and customs regarding parentage in the seven kingdoms has probably always wondered why catelyn hates him so much this revelation gives us an insight into what has really been a black hole for us as viewers just as it remains a black hole for us as readers  what were catelyns and jon snows interactions at winterfell really like over the past 14 years we know that jon grew up with his halfsiblingcousins and we know that jon and robb fully understand how jon is different and that robb probably learned that from catelyn but we dont know a lot more than that based on the scene in the book and the show when jon visits brans bedside we have a sense that cats and jons relationship is awkward as hell if not nonexistent but its strange to think of what that was like on a daytoday basis for the entirety of jons life"

"Nymeria's pup",2013-04-08,"at first when i watched this scene i was thinking what the hell but as i have thought about it i think it makes sense the writers have to condense so much into 10 episodes that they are forced to collapse multiple characters into one character eg thoros and tom o seven and write scenes that while not in the books do follow along with the spirit of the books i can absolutely imagine cat having this kind of back and forth in her mind over the years about jon one day hating him and the next wondering how she can hate him so much for something that is not his fault still being the person she is she cannot ever bring herself to love jon she is in anguish during this scene and playing the what if card that so many of us do when tragedy strikes she is trying to make sense of events that cannot be explained so she begins to blame herself for her inability to keep her promises to the gods if only i could have loved him the gods would not have punished me by taking my children my father my husband away etc i think the point is that cat recognizes it is perhaps a defect on her part that she cannot love jon but that is who she is her duty is to her children first and foremost above all others how could she ever advance jons interest ie treating him as a son giving him the stark name when it could be to the detriment of her own this is why she could not keep her promise the brilliance of this is that grrm has cat die believing that all her children are dead except sansa and that jon is the likely heir it makes you wonder if uncats head would explode should she ever learn the truth about her children and jons parentage edited by nymerias pup 08 april 2013  0115 pm"

"David Selig",2013-04-08,"but isnt that kind of the point she didnt do that to me catelyns speech was not intended to be her speaking logically and rationally i think it was intended to show her growing emotional distress at what was happening to her own childrencatelyn is both religious and emotional i dont see anything implausible about an emotional religious catelyn who prayed for jon to die suddenly freaking out when it looks like it may come true what kind of a mother prays for the death of a child and if the prayer is granted what might the gods ask for in return but this is just not who catelyn is at all in the books iirc she never prays for the death of anyone not even the likes of joff and cersei after neds death look at the sept scene before renly was killed  she only prays for as many people as possible to be spared and if shes ever does pray for death i really dont see her changing her mind when it looks like the prayer is about to be fulfilled thats not her personality at all  when she decides on a course of actions she sticks with ithowever when he recovers her natural animosity takes over and she doesnt follow through with any of that particularly the legitimacy part because that really would affect her blood children this doesnt sound like catelyn from the books either she always keeps her word given the customs in westeros any noblewoman promising such a thing under any circumstances just doesnt ring true to me accepting a your husbands bastard as your stepson and giving him the same kind of love as your children is just not done ever"
"The Wolves",2013-04-08,"all of that combined with the unusual treatment jon gets even for a bastard i think cat does have enough reasons to dislike himno cat doesnt have any legitimate reasons not to like jon jon has never done any harm towards her children her or the tullys in any way so any dislike she has of jon is irrational now she has the right to feel the way she does but there is really no real reason or justification for her to dislike jon or talk about him to others like she did with the blackfish and robb and i get that she has no obligation towards jon cause he is not her childthank gawdbut cat doesnt know jon and never tried to know him and her view of him was irrational so just because he looked like ned more than her own children besides arya is not a reason she should dislike him catelyn was really wrong in that situation especially in her opinion of jon"
"Ororo727 Jon Snow Fangirl",2013-04-08,"i am sure tywin would have graciously accepted the idea that his grandson was an incest born bastard that holds no right to the throne and would have accepted the exile of both his beloved daughter and son if not executionor do you mean that without tyrions capture that ned would never have put 2  2 togetherjon arryn was dead and stannis ran off to dragonstone who else would have spread that rumor at the time of tyrions abduction nobody from the north was in the know about it"
"Har!",2013-04-08,"thats the biggest problem i have with it also they tend to magnify catelyns mistakes on the show the reader knows a lot of the mistakes cat makes as she makes them because the reader has inside information but in general shes a prudent person who makes decent decisions with the information she has she might be the cause in fact of many of the war etc but her heart was in the right place and she certainly isnt being punished for resenting the presence of jon snowi think that is why they added the scene because the mistakes she makes are whoppers and cant be avoided in serializing the book but in the book they are leavened by many many small instances where she is right on so i dont think they magnify her mistakes as much as the mistakes appear much more stark when there is so little canvas air time on which to sketch a characterher redeemingcharacteristicdominant qualities cannot be depicted effectively in a tv serialization so they have to go shorthand with some direct exposition from the character to show her human side and allow her mistakes to look like that  mistakesflaws and not the dominant impression you might come away with if you just saw the serializationthis scene will help make her character more sympathetic as it is in the book as built up thru many small interactions without a major plot changeeta this scene will also make it much more poignant when she argues with robb about legitimizing jon if all the other starks are dead excepting sansa married to the imp and assumed to be dead as soon as she gives him an heir cat will have acknowledged how unfair to jon she has been in the scene from s3e2 and yet still will not be able to get past her hateresentment of jon edited by har 08 april 2013  0217 pm"
"Former Lord of Winterfell",2013-04-08,"but this is just not who catelyn is at all in the books iirc she never prays for the death of anyoneshe actually told jon it should have been you which is a lot worse than just thinking it and the phrasing is a touch odd  she didnt say i wish it was you but rather it should have been you thats consistent with  though not proof of  a past prayer that he dieso the question is whether the time she said it publicly was also the first time shed even thought or prayed for it iand those two things are close enough that i dont see a contradiction its an expansion or elaboration on a backstory that is not inconsistent with something that happened in the book at least thats how i see itand if shes ever does pray for death i really dont see her changing her mind when it looks like the prayer is about to be fulfilled thats not her personality at all  when she decides on a course of actions she sticks with itlike when she told ned that he had to take the position as hand and then did a 180 and what about the guilt she feels after meeting mya stone a person who always stands by whatever theyve done before doesnt feel guilt i dont see the basis for your rigid view of catelyn as never questioning or doubting anything shes donegiven the customs in westeros any noblewoman promising such a thing under any circumstances just doesnt ring true to me accepting a your husbands bastard as your stepson and giving him the same kind of love as your children is just not done everi think thats going a bit far but its unproveable either way in any case as ive said i dont take the scene as catelyn being 100 rational on her causes and effects i think shes getting very scared about what is happening and is perhaps playing a version of pascals wager in her head edited by former lord of winterfell 08 april 2013  0244 pm"

"iceandfireking",2013-04-08,"i actually think this is one of the most briliant scence that this show have created it might appears to the viewers at first sight that this show wants us to be more sympathy towards cat by showing her complex feeling towards jon however if we consider the future event that will unfold around her you will feel that there is something more dark around her dialog she tried to find a reason to explain the misery she was eduring by looking back to a totally unrelevent past event in the past two seasons she was portrayed as a compassionamte and reasonable women who was ready to look forward to settle the dispute rather than add more hatred this scence subtlelly captured the impact of the deaths of ned and their children on her and now she is unforgiving at herself burrying in past memory and yielding to totally unresonable argument for book readers we all know where this path will lead to edited by iceandfireking 08 april 2013  0304 pm"
"Tuor",2013-04-08,"what i found interesting is that jon snow had pox targaryens are imune to this kind of sickness we get that from dany when she remembers that she never was sick are they telling us that rlj isnt true"
"JMJ",2013-04-08,"well this thread has devolved into yet another pro vs anti catelyn thread for me suffice it to say that cat like almost every other character in the series has both good and bad aspects to her persona her treatment of jon was less well clarified in the books but was probably ambivalent at best whilst in the show there are more overtly negative interactions with jon add that this scene in question is quite ambivalent but does clearly make cat out to be ambivalent about her feelings towards jon whether this significantly deviates from the book cat i believe is still up for debate i will say though that claiming cat is the sole reason the wot5k started is hogwash she was one part in a cascade of events leading to war one could argue the real start was robert killing rhaegar on the trident and claiming the it from house targ as well as the whole rlj these events not only set up robert as a neglectful king that let lannister ill will fester but also started varys and lfs plottings more recently cats capture of tyrion was only one step there was jon arryn discovering the twincest lflysa plotting to kill jon arryn jaime pushing bran out the window ned confronting cersei about the twincest lf betraying ned and joff beheading ned one could make a reasonable argument that if any one of these steps did not happen war could have been averted or on the flip side these may have been steps that accelerated the inevitable degeneration of it rule due to roberts years of neglect"
"David Selig",2013-04-08,"she actually told jon it should have been you which is a lot worse than just thinking it usually thats true but if you are a believer in the power of prayer praying for someones death is worse at least thats how i see it and of course the circumstances were far different the extreme grief the guilt over the prayers for bran to stay the lack of sleep all of this made it shouldve been you possible when she prayed for jons death there were no such circumstances she just hated him a lot thats it as far as we knowlike when she told ned that he had to take the position as hand and then did a 180 the circumstances changed significantly not the case with the pray for jons death storyand what about the guilt she feels after meeting mya stone a person who always stands by whatever theyve done before doesnt feel guilt i dont see the basis for your rigid view of catelyn as never questioning or doubting anything shes done i didnt claim this thats obviously not true my point was catelyn is not the kind of person who changes easily her mind and for her praying for someones death is a serious step if she prays for someones death shed really mean it and wont back out when its about to come through reversing her position when the circumstances stayed the same is really not like her imo"
"SelaBela",2013-04-08,"i really enjoyed this scene i actually said awwwwwwwwwwww out loud when she said jon snow it was a sweet moment for me im not really angered by this scene and i dont necessarily think the writers are foreshadowing events we dont know about but like other posters have said just setting up the depth of emotion shes going to feel when robb names jon snow his heiri think that this is one of the less intrusive changes that dd has made on the character of catelyn her letting jaime go before finding out about bran and rikon and her telling ned stark not to go to kings landing were far greater changes in my opinionthis story while completely made up seemed to stay consistent with what we know of her from the books she is compassionate worships the seven and doesnt love jon snowthe only issue i took with the dialog is when she tried to blame everything that had happened on not being able to love jon that is an incredibly illogical leap of conclusionthere isnt much that is logical about grief"
"protar",2013-04-08,"im not a great fan of cat so while the alterations to her character are undoubtedly unnecessary ive never been too bothered by them but this has been the worst so far as i was watching it i just got to telling myself that it was just a past lapse in cats character that didnt effect her present characterisation  but then she goes and blames everything directly on herself theres no doubt in my mind that that dd are deliberately doing this to cat"
"TalalOfDorne",2013-04-08,"i just dont know what to say teat was a very bad scene imo yes i am aware that the show isnt the novels and there is an understandable amount of change that happens in every adaption but this they made it look like she had to love jon or be a mother to him and catelyn never wished for him to die anyone who brings up the it should have been you argument against this is basically telling martin how to write her character because shes not cruel enough as long as im writing this i may as well add that that im not very satisfied with how different tv cat is from book cat they just constantly show her crying fro her kids and staining robbs kingly image in the series she grieves over her husband and kids and actually does something to help save them and their cause whether its giving robb advice or being an envoy i think part of my anger as well has to be the fact that i hated the jeynetalisa change actually talisas character in general edited by talalofdorne 08 april 2013  0317 pm"

"TalalOfDorne",2013-04-08,"for all the good things the show does its handling of catelyn stark is not one of themyoure really really really wrong it shows catelyn is a bad mother because she identifies herself as jons mother meaning she failed as a mother to him in contrast bookcatelyn knows that shes not jons mother and therefore has no obligations towards himthis fandom is really living up to its reputation todaythe catelyntalisa scene was absolutely horrible it felt like badly written fanfictiongreat ep all around loved lady olenna so much nice to see the hound back as well the intro of the reed kids was just perfect i agree the catelyn scene stunk ill give them the benefit of the doubt that they put that in to setup something else later on but really didnt care for it one bitjust a big fat agreegif classbbcemoticon altagree  agreegif classbbcemoticon altagree  on all these"
"Former Lord of Winterfell",2013-04-08,"usually thats true but if you are a believer in the power of prayer praying for someones death is worse at least thats how i see iti get that point i didnt take it as though thats what she did every day  more a confession that she had slipped and let her anger get the better of her on occasionand of course the circumstances were far different the extreme grief the guilt over the prayers for bran to stay the lack of sleep all of this made it shouldve been you possible when she prayed for jons death there were no such circumstances she just hated him a lot thats it as far as we knowwell i agree with that to some extent obviously anytime they go outside the strict confines of textual dialogue the reasonableness is based on an extrapolation but i think most people harbor some pretty nasty thoughts on occasion even if they dont really wish for it to come true catelyn having occasionally gotten angry and wishing jon dead in that anger is plausible to me i can understand why everyone wouldnt feel the same though theres enough ambiguity in her speech that i think you can draw different things from itthe circumstances changed significantly not the case with the pray for jons death storysure they did isnt a little boy or baby actually being on a deathbed and about to die a different circumstance from hurt feelings leading to a theoretical wish that a healthy kid might die one is more fantasy the other realityif she prays for someones death shed really mean it and wont back out when its about to come through reversing her position when the circumstances stayed the same is really not like her imoas i said i think there is a great difference between wishing something bad on someone else and then pushing for it when it seems about to come true the former can be hurt feelings and emotion the latter takes true hatred anyway didnt catelyn express some guilt over jon what could she have felt guilty about"
"JonCon's Red Beard",2013-04-08,"again its not because cat didnt love jon is because she made a promise to the gods and she couldnt keep it probably in some twisted corner of her mind she might be thinking is all jons fault for exist and get sick and cause her to make such a promise but in general speaking its not about her relationship with jon but the fact that she failed to her gods and theyre using her children and family to get even at her failing to try to love jonwhat i found interesting is that jon snow had pox targaryens are imune to this kind of sickness we get that from dany when she remembers that she never was sick are they telling us that rlj isnt truedragon pox"
"Ser Greguh",2013-04-08,"another reason for the story may have been that dd are choosing to play up the notion that the ability to warg and magical abilities in general are often tied to neardeath experiences something that the books have hinted at but not stated explicitly including a story where jon nearly died may be setting up jons ability to warg thatd be a big deviation from bookcanon but i have a sneaking suspicion that dd may be simplifying the warging ability down to that and not having any of the stark children except for bran and jon be wargs thats just a wildass guess but i thought it was suspicious that they introduce warging as a concept and have orell give jon a dirty look probably setting up the wargscanseeotherwargs bit in the same episode that they expanded jons backstory to include a neardeath experience"

"David Selig",2013-04-08,"of course its ridiculous but you missed the point she would never consider it in her right mind but she was horrified that she believed her actions directly led to the potential death of an innocent infant thats why when the child lived and her guilt and selfloathing subsided she realized well no im not going through with that i didnt miss anything horrified or not this idea is just not something a noblewoman in westeros would ever consider seriously its just not done period the idea that someone as devout and honorable as catelyn would backtrack on a serious promise to the gods is equally implausible"

"David Selig",2013-04-08,"the honorable cat also held the heir of a major westerosi house captive with impunity for a crime with basically no proof after her husband begs her not to do anything rash there was no honor in that whatsoever this had nothing whatsoever to do to do with honori guess i dont think cat is as perfect as you do i dont think she is perfect at all but she always keeps her word  thats a fact even her last action before her death emphasised this trait which is one of the reasons why this scene is a major deviation from the books and the show until now and doesnt work for me"

"jotabe1789",2013-04-09,"i enjoyed this scene quite a bit makes her a bit more sympathetic than in the books a person who suffers so much as she does should be given moments where we can connect with her feelings i dont think she really hated jon it was ned she hated she had been a good and proper lady she had given up her beloved riverlands and gone to that stark cold place where even her own gods hardly had a place and ned repaid her by not giving her even the first chance to show how good a wife she could be the honorable eddard stark had cheated on her the first occasion he had and would insult her by keeping his bastard with him and her but she couldnt hate ned because she had grown to love him she saw that ned was really honorable and caring so she had to redirect her hidden bitteness redirect it to someone whom she wasnt required to love and then she thought that if the child just died then there would be no reason anymore for her to keep her hatred for jon for ned alive and she wouldnt have to bear those conflicting emotions any longer about her promises specially the promise to ask ned to legitimize jon she says she was the whole night by his side awake a whole night is many hours an awful lot of minutes the child doesnt seem to get better so she tries to bargain with the gods she starts small promising that shell treat him better but he still doesnt get better so her bargaining scalates she will love him she will be a mother to him and the child is still not getting better and desperate to get rid of her guilt no longer believing it will work she even promises to to tell ned that he could be legitimized and then the kid gets better and she realizes she has just made a promise to the gods and she cannot take it back because the gods kept their part of the bargain but she doesnt intend to keep hers"
"LadyMary",2013-04-09,"i watched it and knew it would cause outrage but i had no problem with it at all im a catelyn fan i understand her hatred and treatment of jon but dont condone it obviously this scene just seemed to fill in one page of their long history together catelyn still hated jon after this but had a moment of weakness we see her regretting what she said to jon later in got so i dont think its unreasonable or out of character for her to have had previous moments of weakness with jonsome people think the scene was a kind of character assassination but i thought it was the opposite i loved the scene there i said it  loved it i always thought cats unrelenting anger and resentment at a boy who had no control over his fate was very offputting i dont think it shows weakness to admit her fault or feel regret and guilt for the way she treated him even if her guilt was kind of extreme because she blames all of her familys troubles on reneging on a promise she made to the seven really it was jon arryns death that set all the subsequent events in motioni think the whole scene made cat more relatable and real good people have flaws and blind spots that can cause setbacks in their lives admitting them is the first step to moving beyond them in this case she cant make it up to jon but maybe there will be some payoff for her confession down the road"
"Buckwheat",2013-04-09,"i think i learned to differentiate between cat in the books and cat in the show i was angry with her presentation most of the season 2 but i really appreciated that scene minus the fact that talisa was there i still cannot stand that one mostly due to michelle fairley being such a great actress i love how she manages to act cats sadness"
"Northbound",2013-04-09,"i have a question about what cat said in the episode did she say if the gods let jon live that she would ask ned to give jon the stark name or that she did ask him of course the reason i ask leads more in to who jon potentially is now most of us who have read the books have brought up the fact there is a lot of back story being left out of the show it seems at this point we are going to get very little of itif at all now back to last nights episode if cat said that she did ask ned to give jon a stark name and he refused that could leds us to one conclusion that ned didnt want to draw attention to jon assuming rlj is true could this be a way that the show creators are trying to bridge the back story"

"Stark@heart",2013-04-09,"so what did you think of this scene i know most people hated it  but what is the point of it is it to to really emphasize that connection jon still has to the starks and that he can be legitimized at one point i personally didnt like the change because it didnt feel like something that cat would ever think but im curious what others thinkedit here is the whole dialoguei prayed for my son bran to survive his fall many years before that one of the boys came down with the pox maester luwin said if he made it through the night hed live it would be a very long night so i sat with him all through the darkness listened to his ragged little breathes his coughing his whimperingwhich boyjon snow when my husband brought that baby home from the war i couldnt bear to look at him i didnt want to see those brown strangers eyes staring up at me so i prayed to the gods take him away make him die he got the pox and i knew i was the worst woman who ever lived a murderer id condemned this poor innocent child to a to a horrible death all because i was jealous of his mother a woman he didnt even know so i pray to all seven gods let the boy live let him live and illl love him ill be a mother to him ill beg my husband to give him a true name to call him stark and be done with it to make him one of us and he livedand he lived and i couldnt keep my promise and everything thats happened since then all this horror thats come to my family its all because i couldnt love a motherless childedit im quoting francis buck from another thread because i think its interestingcatelyns story about jon wasweird it doesnt bother me necessarily but it was definitely a strange addition its one of those instances like danys vision of the iron throne destroyed and covered in snow where i feel like the showrunners know important things about the end of the series and thus are purposely foreshadowing events that the book readers could have no inkling to i really dont think they just make up random shit like that for the sake of it though thats how many book readers seem to feeli loved it it came out of no where or did it i like your thinking on thati just love the fact that they finally made her say it thats been my feelings about cat from the start shes caught up on family duty honor in a bad way and it keeps her from making jon a part of her family and even pretending to like him a duty in that society that could have been expected of her because neds bastard affronted her sense of honorit was also cat who insisted ned to go south with the king because it suited her purpose  idea of family duty honor after the letter was received from her sister family lysaand it was cat who listened to littelfinger and never questioned the motive of a man she spurred years ago and hasnt seen or spoke to since who took tyrion out of her own sense of fulfilling the motto of family duty honor yes cat is much more complex and shrewd in some instances in the book but i think the show is doing a great job getting across the truth behind the characters almost everyone who reads the books has that feeling about cat that she should have accepted and loved jon it might not have changed anything but you never know the readers get to have those moments of wondering after reading the words on the page the viewer has to see italot of things have and will be changed thats the nature of it but it can also add to the experience  meaning in the books i think that will happen with the others too l think the show will reveal some background that will answer or at least address some of the question surrounding the wall and others and wrights and ice magic etci was never a cat fan more like  hate and i can see why the show needed to make her more likeable and use her character to explain some things like what happens when she dies will also tell alot cant wait"

him wanted only to fleesomething cold moved in her eyes  i told you to leave  we dont want you here  who is the we is she speaking for bran stark as well this is symbolic of jons later dreams of the crypt where cold eyes stare at him and say you do not belong hereonce that would have sent him running once that might have even made him cry  pattern of earlier times with catelyn starki prayed for my special boy i prayed for it she said dully  he was my special boy i went to the sept and prayed seven times to seven faces of gods that ned would change his mind adn leave him here with me sometimes prayers are answered catelyn praying to god and in her mind the gods answered her with brans fall and being close to death this i think is where the tv producers took the idea that catelyn stark believes the gods are punishing her but they twisted it to refer to jon snow the book certainly has not yet done this in agotjon tries to comfort her  it wasnt your fault he mangaged after an awkward silence  the irony of jon snow trying to give comfort to a woman who has hated him and made him feel unwanted his entire lifeher eyes found him they were full of poison i need none of your absolution bastard further down in the chapter martin tells us that never one time has catelyn tully stark ever called jon by his name just this onceshe says jon so that he turns around so she can deliver the stinging words it should have been you that is not only a stabbing in the heart but a twisting the blade she deliberatley used his name for the first time in his life so that she could utter  it should have been youthe tv show upset me but sometimes i think the people who have read the book upset me morelol go read that pov once againunderline the adjectives and think about the history martin is giving us subtly in how catelyn has treated jon through the yearsthis was not a distant neglect from this womanit was nasty and sometimes in jons face never using his name once so are we to imply she called him bastard daily or snow  martin does not tell ushe only gives the character catelyn the linebastardcatelyn stark is a character that i admire for many reason her love for her children however i am not giving her a pass on this entire scene i do like the idea that the tv writers are trying to make her more sympathetic and trying to show that she has struggled with guilt over her treatment and feelings towards jon snow and perhaps rob making jon his heirmartins work is subjective in the sense that when we read his wordswe each have emotional responses to the characters and stories i am an older woman with a strong traditional religious faith i am sure this colors my feelings regarding characters but i do try to actually go back and read each word written by martin to objectively try to understand the charactergreat post all aroundthe idea that she was really just sort of neutral towards him crashes completely on the fact that she had never called him by his name his entire life i mean thats quite a concept to get your head around and the emphasis on her prayers to the seven then the it should have been you makes her having prayed for his death at some point in the past seem like barely a stretch at alland i also think your point about being a parent is important my view of other peoples kids annoying babies crying etc all changed once i had kids of my own being a parent somehow brings you closer to all children not just your own catelyn i think was torn between who she is as a motherperson and her resentment of jon its why she later felt guilt even in the books for the way she treated him and i think the scene on tv makes perfect sense completely consistent with how youd expect a normally very caring and devoted mother to feel about the way she treated another childincidentally martin does clarify how catelyn behaved around jon for most of those 15 yearsright she didnt make a habit of telling jon she wished he was dead and she didnt do whatever grrm meant by abuse whether hes talking physical abuse or whatever we dont know at the same time she never called him by his name once his entire life except the time she told him she wishes it had been him i suppose snow probably makes the most sense i dont care what label you put on that but that is some pretty nasty shit ive got stepkids and deliberately never calling one of them by their actual name would be a pretty nasty piece of businessi do think martin was a bit surprised by the negative reaction to catelyn and has made an effort to soften that reaction among fandom to avoid painting a picture of her he didnt intend and honestly i think what the writers did with catelyns speech pointing out that she wasnt good to him but also that she is a good person who regrets

"Sun",2013-04-10,"incidentally martin does clarify how catelyn behaved around jon for most of those 15 yearsthus the question i have is if catelyn went out of her way to mistreat jon in the past  and which form this might have taken  or if she rather tried to avoid and ignore himmistreatment is a loaded word did catelyn beat jon bloody no did she distance herself from him yes did she verbally abuse and attack him no the instance in brans bedroom was obviously a very special case but i am sure she was very protective of the rights of her own children and in that sense always drew the line sharply between bastard and trueborn where issues like seating on the high table for the kings visit were at issueand jon surely knew that she would have preferred to have him elsewhereif thats how he intended to present catelyns treatment of jon then he failed in writing it at least he failed with me the text is quoted by a poster above and it does suggest a pattern a history if you will of emotional rejection resentment and even hate not mere distanceon to the scene in the show the reason i found fault in it is because theres plenty for catelyn to blame herself for but to pin it all on a broken promise to the gods seems too irrational even for catelynrather than blame herself for her role in precipitating the war by kidnapping tyrion or for not not returning north to winterfell once the war has started or for releasing jaime lannister and engendering the resentment and possible rebellion among robbs ranks and possibly risking her only surviving sons life she has to go as far back as a broken promise to the gods to find a responsible act it just does not make sensethe scene was emotionally potent it made me cry but it was logically flawed imo edited by sun 10 april 2013  0408 pm"

lacking one i wanted to see whether the poster who claimed is a hypocrite in this respectfirst the point isnt whether youd choose to adopt the analogy would be if you were forced to accept a child into your home against your will how would you treat that child so whether the particular poster actually adopted a child isnt relevant more importantly adoption entails a slew of duties and responsibilities  something of which you might be aware if you are a parent financial responsibilities feeding clothing changing staying home or getting day care etc etc etc all the ways in which children suck up massive amounts of time and committment can you even afford to provide for it when youre talking about a poster adopting a child in rl those are all huge real world factors that a poster has to considercatelyn had to consider none of those things which is why asking a poster if heshe has adopted children makes no sense jon was going to be raised in winterfell as neds son no matter what so all those adoption issues are irrelevant the only question is how she would choose to treat that guiltless babychild who is going to be raised in her home a halfbrothersister to her own

contention and the contention of others is that most adults have a basic parental instinct that includes how you treat babies and small children who are in your presence even those who are not your own it may not kick into gear until you actually have children of your own but for most people who do have children its there and by extension how youd view others who failed to meet that standard there are likely innumerable instances in human history where a couple has taken care of an abandoned baby not out of any cultural expecation but simply because something within them thought it was wrong not to and its also been pointed out that this instinct has even extended across species id add that i think many nonadults also have a sense of how babies should be treated and not because theyve attended a seminar on the subjectbut you object to this your argument is either 1 that parental instinct either doesnt exist  or 2 that catelyn and everyone else in westeros is somehow immune to it what i dont think you are grasping is that while you are arguing show me where this mothering instinct thingy exists in the text the rest of us are saying this is something that most parents inherently feel and expect from others as part of being a human beingcat stood up to ned by often asking him to send jon to be fostered away and later refusing to be one in charge of him when ned left to become handin what respect was her treatment of jon standing up to ned ned likely wasnt even aware of it he certainly wasnt aware of that final commentnot mothering jon was completely justified imo he was not her kid he had others to take care of him and it wouldve caused cat problems  major humiliation shed have been considered the biggest doormat in westeros rightly or not and increase in the chance of jon causing trouble in the succession with this added bit of legitimacywhat is interesting about that justification is that it all would still apply even if ned had told her the truth after all if ned had told her shed still have to keep it secret so the major humiliation would exist to the same degree theres be the same succession issues etc but actually i do disagree with you here on the major humiliation the vast majority of westeros is going to have no clue as to exactly what is happening at that level within the stark family at winterfell id guess very few people outside winterfell knew that she never called him by his name why would they its not exactly the type of thing you send a raven about to the extent there was embarassment it would be based on the existence of jon in winterfell as neds bastard and that wasnt changing no matter how she treated himi also dont agree that everyone would have viewed her negatively sure it is not normally done to bring a bastard back but thats a different thing from saying it is okay for the wife to take out her resentments on the child if that should happen i could imagine the qot having an interesting conversation with cat on this so you exclude him from table where possible you never call him by his own name deliberately avoided showing him any affection despite him not having a mother what did he do to you that warranted this oh you treat the child this way because his father fucked some maid i hope your natural children grow up with better sense than youor better yet what would the mother say catelyn prays to the seven and particularly the mother the asoiaf wiki has an interesting entry on that the last line of the song to the mother is teach us all a kinder way is that something she followed with jon

someone of the good guys showing dislike of the chosen saviour super special one jon snow for once were wrong but not really a big dealwell thats a disagreement again to use the example of an adoptive child in a family of otherwise natural children i think the mother never calling that child by its own name while doing that for the other children deliberately being cold to the child for its entire life etc would be a very big deal at least to the child"

"SeanF",2013-04-11,"i take it that is a nofirst the point isnt whether youd choose to adopt the analogy would be if you were forced to accept a child into your home against your will how would you treat that child so whether the particular poster actually adopted a child isnt relevantmore importantly adoption entails a slew of duties and responsibilities  something of which you might be aware if you are a parent financial responsibilities feeding clothing changing staying home or getting day care etc etc etc all the ways in which children suck up massive amounts of time and committment can you even afford to provide for it when youre talking about a poster adopting a child in rl those are all huge real world factors that a poster has to considercatelyn had to consider none of those things which is why asking a poster if heshe has adopted children makes no sense jon was going to be raised in winterfell as neds son no matter what so all those adoption issues are irrelevant the

"SeanF",2013-04-11,"uh does that mean youd agree that catelyn would think her treatment of jon was less that the mother would have wanted because if so then that goes a long way towards explaining what she said to salisa particularly since shes now praying to the mother again to save her own children essentially her speech is please forgive me for falling short of what you expected of me as a mother i know i should have done betterunfortunately i edited my post slightly after you had postedi dont doubt for one moment that catelyn would feel remorse for having prayed for jons death and then for having made promises to the gods that she didnt keepbook catelyn of course did not pray for jons death or make promises to the gods so she certainly wouldnt feel that remorse if the religion of the seven required her to set aside any feelings of resentment which she had as a result of having had neds illegitimate son foisted on her and to treat him like one of her own children then i imagine that she would acknowledge during her prayers that shed fallen short of the standards that the mother expectedwhile the religion of the seven has similarities to christianity i dont think we know enough about its theology to answer that question one significant difference between the two religions is that while christianity requires its adherents to forgive wrongs that have been done to them the religion of the seven allows revenge edited by seanf 11 april 2013  1121 am"

"AliKat",2013-04-11,"i know this scene has had a lot of people up in arms i was mainly confused by it then i realized catelyns totally depressed she has nothing right now and often when everything is going wrong you look for reasons why is this happening talisa asked her if she had ever made that scary craft thing before and she remembered she had made one for jon thats what brought the incident to mind and since shes depressed she was just like thats probably why everything bad is happening to my family because i broke my word to the seven when robb told her about her father she made a comment about wearing manicles to his funeral shes just broken right now and everything reminds her of something else horrible going onim curious whether the nonbook readers who only watched the show felt more sympathy for her or less because im not sure if it was meant to make her look better or worse one thing i noticed is that when talisa approached her and offered her help she gave her the evil death glare she gave jon in episode 1 so in my mind lady stark is not even attempting to be civil to talisa either where in the books she was kind to jeyne i think this shows that catelyn  right now  is so depressed she doesnt know what to do with herself to make anything better shes not even attempting to make things better with robb the only child with her by being kind to his new wife shes just hopeless right now and i dont think anything she really says out of that hopelessness is a character trait its just depression and morbid thoughts"

"Former Lord of Winterfell",2013-04-12,"thats shocking whod have thought that a character admitting to praying for a babys death because she was jealous of his probably dead already mum would make people dislike the character morebut you have to factor into that nonreader calculus that they omitted the it should have been you line from the books that was a very big deal for a lot of readers who have essentially hated her character because of the it should have been you line by omitting that line the show made catelyn a more sympathetic less vindictive character than in the books so its hardly a surprise that when nonreaders see a side of catelyn they never saw before they may see her less sympathetically than they did beforereally what the show did was show that side of catelyn a bit differently and later in the narrative that may have been a deliberate decision because even martin was surprised by the vitriol directed at catelyn because of that im guessing the showrunners skippe that line because they didnt want to scar catelyns character in the mind of viewers who wouldnt have the benefit of martins later clarification that this was a unique event theyd just hate her for it and that wasnt martins intent in presenting the characterso they wait until the 3rd season to show the depth of animosity she had towards jon at times but balance that past cruelty by showing that she knows it was wrong and regrets ithow each of us readers interprets that compared to the books is likely to be vary as much as the individual reactions we all had to book catelyn some of us really liked her im one of those and some really really hated her given the variance in reactions to book cat its natural that there is disagreement over whether hbo cat is generally consistent with book cat and i dont think there is a right or wrong answer to that edited by former lord of winterfell 12 april 2013  0153 pm"

"Jojosh",2013-04-14,"it made cat really sympathetic because look how down she is hating jon snow and putting it in the context of how its led her here in the show is brilliant"
"HouseLark",2013-04-14,"im kind of late to this party but i cant go along with those that think this scene killed cats character tv cat is just a fundamentally different character from the books she has been from the start my reading of cat has always been as a sort of rational cersei in that she knows she could be a good lord and is somewhat frustrated by the limitations that westerosi society places on women but where cersei rails against that catelyn accepts it as the way of things and tries to make her way in the world through accepted methods and so we see how she influences ned quietly and im assuming wisely since ned readily accepts cats advice we later see her doing the same with robb and its also apparent that the other northern lords accept cat as an authority figure and dont dismiss her input now thats only part of her character as well as the standard mother daughter wife roles but its arguably the most interesting unfortunately the show has discarded almost all of that and the only scene that i can remembering which tv cat acted in accordance with book cat is in that first meeting with renly when she administers a dressing down first to the whole baratheontyrell entourage then to renly himself this new jon snow with the pox scene doesnt really damage cat it is in fact quite inkeeping with how the show has portrayed the character so far by turns it softens cat and hardens her for the viewer and ultimately it papers over the crack made by the omission of the it should have been you line from the first season i suppose what im saying in short is that this new scene did not remove a layer of complexity from cat she has just never been a particularly complex character in the show and its late in the game to expect anything different now i do obviously miss book cat but ive accepted from pretty early on that got is an adaptation with all that implies some characters were always going to suffer on the positive side michelle fairley is doing a great job with the material she has been given"

"Keishi of Oldstones",2013-04-15,"so what did you think of this scene i know most people hated it  but what is the point of it is it to to really emphasize that connection jon still has to the starks and that he can be legitimized at one point i personally didnt like the change because it didnt feel like something that cat would ever think but im curious what others thinkedit here is the whole dialoguei prayed for my son bran to survive his fall many years before that one of the boys came down with the pox maester luwin said if he made it through the night hed live it would be a very long night so i sat with him all through the darkness listened to his ragged little breathes his coughing his whimperingwhich boyjon snow when my husband brought that baby home from the war i couldnt bear to look at him i didnt want to see those brown strangers eyes staring up at me so i prayed to the gods take him away make him die he got the pox and i knew i was the worst woman who ever lived a murderer id condemned this poor innocent child to a to a horrible death all because i was jealous of his mother a woman he didnt even know so i pray to all seven gods let the boy live let him live and illl love him ill be a mother to him ill beg my husband to give him a true name to call him stark and be done with it to make him one of us and he livedand he lived and i couldnt keep my promise and everything thats happened since then all this horror thats come to my family its all because i couldnt love a motherless childedit im quoting francis buck from another thread because i think its interestingcatelyns story about jon wasweird it doesnt bother me necessarily but it was definitely a strange addition its one of those instances like danys vision of the iron throne destroyed and covered in snow where i feel like the showrunners know important things about the end of the series and thus are purposely foreshadowing events that the book readers could have no inkling to i really dont think they just make up random shit like that for the sake of it though thats how many book readers seem to feelthats how i took that moment as a foreshadowing things to come like maybe lady stoneheart will want jon as her champion and that jon may finally get the love and recognition he always wanted from lady stoneheart he never got from cat"

"Lord Barristan",2013-04-09,"hey guys storm of swords is one of my favorite books of alltime and when they said they would be splitting it into two season i thought for certain this would mean they would fit more in my favorite storyline in the book is by far jaimes in the book he and brienne have 3 full chapter which a pretty long at that before they are captured by lord vargo in this season we were given one scene that was masterful and the duel that was underwhelming why not flesh out these two before being captured i know they had some scenes at the end of last season but i feel shortchanged on the best duo in the series i also love arya and the brotherhood without banners i knwo we cant expect them to cast all the member of the brotherhood but i really wish they would have kept around tom osevens and thoros greenbeard lem the huntsman and some of the others may have been too much but certainly harwin being a winterfell man should have been included and they have already captured the hound this takes fairly later in aryas journey i hope we get to see more of the brotherhood"

"~Shiera Seastar~",2013-04-09,"yeah its rushed because there are too many characters locations and events needed to be shown and the show only got 50something minutes per episode to cover everything leaving me wanting more obviously there are a lot of great scenes from that book so as long as they wont leave them out to squeezed ros in ill be okay i hope we get to see more of the brotherhoodi hope so too they are my new favorite gangplus i would gladly trade some of the minor arya stuff for those gold scenes between arya and the hound i am looking forward to that odd couple just as much as jaime and briennethe show better not cut my favorite arya and the hound scenes  they provide one of the best conversations and interactions from the book i want to see how maisie and rory bring those book scenes on the screen"

"Tywin's bastard",2013-04-11,"you really think so i mean some things in the first season couldve been better paced if it was more episodes but about the same amount of jon and dany scenes spread out wed have a real sense that dany was seven months pregnant and that jon had been training at the wall a long time  in the show we kind of feel like danys only two months pregnant and jons been there a week and then other things like arya chasing a cat one episode and then still chasing the cat the next episodedespite it being weeks lol and also the almost awkwardly fast pace of some eventstourney everything postneds imprisonment war wisebut as a whole i feel like the first season did a pretty solid job making season one perfection simply wouldve been a matter of1 higher budget therefore better effects fights more actors to cast important roles now rather than laterroose bolton edmure and brynden etc and all that jazz2 no gratuitous sexnudity scenes for shits and giggles3 two or three more episodes4 not assuming the audience is idiots and cutting out all militarystrategic discussionif they had done all this i think season one would have been perfect obviously its not what happened thoughyes i do id even go so far to say that it seemed to be the prevailing opinion since my biggest memory of the discussions about the early part of season 2 was that that people thought the pacing and transitions between storylines were so much better not that it gives the opinion any more credence opinions are opinions im just showing that its not an uncommon one1 higher budget is something you can always wish for but its pretty pointless since it just wont happen the show was already hugely expensive2 the nudity didnt bother me theres lots of it in the books actually more detailed than on the show and i dont get neither upset or very aroused by that i just take it as another context among many others3 again a nice wish that just wont happen dd has said many times that they would like more time but they cant keep the same quality of production if they stretch it further4 apart from that they hid some surprises i guess they go less on it due to that they arent showing that much of the battles i dont get the conclusion that they would supposedly do this because they think the audience is stupid that make no sense to me given how much they expect the audience to piece together in the overall story a nonreader really needs to be alert to grasp everything looking on this board even readers fail to get a good deal of ithe had a lot to sayhe had a lot of nothing to say eulogy by toolin a literal sense those episodes were pretty much 95 talkingbut was anything truly discussed everything was shallow all the meat was cut from the bone and there was no substance etc my nonbook reading friends are confused they thought stannis was killed and completely out of the pictureapparently forgetting the last ep of season 2 they have no idea if robb stark is winning or losing they have no idea what the bloody hell is happening in the northwith the ironmen in general and theonwinterfell specifically etcso much is discussed but so little is actually said in the context of the show but the story isnt supposed to be a soapopera with loads of romanticism and tits and hilariously unrealistic goredeath scenes a song of ice  fire is at its core about war and how war affects everyone and at the end of the day doesnt matter the shows 100 neglect of everything and anything militarystrategy talk is seriously negatively affecting everyones view of the showthe thing i love with dialogue in these books especially in a clash of kings is that there really isnt that much dialogue but damn near everything that is said from one character to another is essential in some way or another but the show waters down everything for whatever reason they think shocking homosexual blowjob scenes tits constant swearing and overly cheesy gore is appropriate yet they think toning down everything plot wise and completely removing all discussion of war is a good move they need to get their priorities rightdo you understand me now you dont have to agree i just want to make sure im being cleari see what youre saying but i dont agree the nonreaders i know dont have any problems following the things you mention either even your own description of them makes it look like they just arent paying attention to whats being presented stannis was very obviously not killed robbs success is supposed to be hard to get because he doesnt even get it himself i win every battle but somehow im losing the war whats going on in the north is mostly said right out even theon says exactly what hes done and why he does it even with this season theres tons of hints that show where theon is and who has him but it requires you to think a bit which is mostly exactly how the books tend to work with mysteriesi dont think you can watch a show like this and dont really try to grasp everything again this goes even for readers although they might be foiling themselves by being bad at adapting their thinking from what the book says to what they are actually being shown for example i dont know if i saw anyone in the discussion about littlefinger talking to sansa actually grasp the fact that they are making a parallel to littlefinger and eddard hopefully some did and i just didnt read it all some were just so stuck on that littlefinger talked himself instead of using pawns like in the booksthis so much this between davids horrible xmen movieshardcore xmen fan here and game of thrones im under the impression that dd are the definition of incompetent oh well shame theres enough quality to keep me coming back for morethis wasnt directed to me but it made me wonder what has david written more than wolverine when it comes to xmen as far as i know that was his only thing plus that his script was apparently mutilated quite severely from what he actually wrote before it got usedas for them being incompetent id say that its a pretty hard thing to say seeing how this adaptation is one of the hardest to do that ive ever come across and theyve managed to make it a huge hit thats known for quality unlike for example true blood which is also a big hit but doesnt have that general quality image not that popularity says much in terms of individual taste but it is related to competence and its imo at least as relevant as using friends that dont pay attention as arguments"

think how affcadwd will fairasos is easily the fastest paced book in the series by far but to be fair its not the books fault its the shows fault for being so fucking stupid in season twothe only character who imo meandered and was slow in the whole of the first three books was arya in asosher bwb chapters werent anywhere nearly as rewarding as id hoped theyd be and her nonred wedding chapters with sandor were mih aside from the last oneeven in affcadwd the only characters who really feel to me as meandering and tiresome are arya and samwell but opinionsthen the story might not be for those people even in the books you have several battles not being described or being described very briefly and it will of course be more so in a tv show the point behind that is that the violence isnt the important part in itself its the result thats the real point that doesnt mean that i completely dismiss your point as it has relevance im just showing that the original story isnt very different if you count the differences of the mediums the battle at the fist isnt described much at all in the book its mainly recollected in hindsight and theres no budget issues going onits not the violence or the climax thats important its the suspense of who is where with whom where are they moving next will they win oh what happens now that the ironmen are attacking the north oh i wonder if dorne will side with renly or what etci find anything militaristic and strategic in the books to be the most suspenseful aspect of the entire series and even if we only learn a few details about specific battles i have enough imagination to make it even better in my own mind than reading about it except when necessary like the blackwater and the nw battlesthats just like my opinion though if a show entirely centered around a story about war being horrible and pointless decides to complete bypass everything you know war in exchange for soap opera tyrionandshae robbandwhatsherface rosandlittlefinger scenes then i guess the show just never understood the books to begin withas for brienne and jaime i dont have a clue what you mean two scenes in every episode they werent even in the first episode the two scenes they had this time were also not at all similar the first one was them walking around and talking and they meet a farmer where brienne has to make a choice between honorably risking security or doing a bad thing the second has jaime trying to kill her in a fight scene and they get caught due to briennes previous choice how you can describe those two as identical and just containing jaime being mean and brienne telling him to walk is completely beyond meto be fair those scenes were rather long and dreary and were just jaime japping around also lol  some random villager having seen jaime lannister before and running into locke and knowing where jaime was exactly just all around lol to that whole thingevery jaime lannister scene from season two was awful though great acting and such just terrible writingyes i do id even go so far to say that it seemed to be the prevailing opinion since my biggest memory of the discussions about the early part of season 2 was that that people thought the pacing and transitions between storylines were so much better not that it gives the opinion any more credence opinions are opinions im just showing that its not an uncommon onereally from a scene transition standpoint it really feels like theres no flow in season twoor three to me but when it comes to like the scenes themselves in the first season every episode had its own ark for select scenes by a certain character secondthird seasons theres no inepisode ark its just random scenesfrom both a cinematic standpoint and a plot standpoint i see no way it flows better now1 higher budget is something you can always wish for but its pretty pointless since it just wont happen the show was already hugely expensive2 the nudity didnt bother me theres lots of it in the books actually more detailed than on the show and i dont get neither upset or very aroused by that i just take it as another context among many others3 again a nice wish that just wont happen dd has said many times that they would like more time but they cant keep the same quality of production if they stretch it furtherthese are all wishful thinking obviously whats done is done and obviously it wasnt my show but still i can dream as for the nudity theres definitely more of it in the show than in all five of the books put together as to the descriptiveness youre right some of the sex scenes are definitely more vivid than whats shown in the show  but with text comes metaphors symbolism insight into characters thoughts etc so sex sceneswhether tragic horrifying or lovely can all be quite beautiful in their own way sex scenes in tv or film can be as well but i dont believe there has been a single nudity scene in the show thus far that i consider artistic except perhaps theon on the boat with the wench that scene was brilliantly done and well acted and gave us a good insight into theon and an excellent parallel as he gets bitched slapped around for the rest of the season4 apart from that they hid some surprises i guess they go less on it due to that they arent showing that much of the battles i dont get the conclusion that they would supposedly do this because they think the audience is stupid that make no sense to me given how much they expect the audience to piece together in the overall story a nonreader really needs to be alert to grasp everything looking on this board even readers fail to get a good deal of itdd and grrm have all stated that the reasons theyve pretty much canceled out strategic talk in the show was because according to ddit wouldnt be as interesting to viewers as other things and according to grrm we all agreed that the military plots could be a bit thick for some viewers at home to follow especially if theyre only watching once a weeknot direct quotes but pretty close ill find the sources tonight and edit them into this posti see what youre saying but i dont agree the nonreaders i know dont have any problems following the things you mention either even your own description of them makes it look like they just arent paying attention to whats being presented stannis was very obviously not killed robbs success is supposed to be hard to get

even with this season theres tons of hints that show where theon is and who has him but it requires you to think a bit which is mostly exactly how the books tend to work with mysteriesim just basing this all off my roomies who only watched the show havent rewatched the show since last year and havent read the books well one read the first 400 pages of agot and got bored and stopped but he doesnt countpeople just dont understand who is who what is what as easily as people whove watched the show multiple times through thus far and read the books hell it wasnt until i was at the very end of season two before i realized who roose bolton was in the show i just thought it was some nameless generalthis wasnt directed to me but it made me wonder what has david written more than wolverine when it comes to xmen as far as i know that was his only thing plus that his script was apparently mutilated quite severely from what he actually wrote before it got usedwasnt david behind both wolverine and the last stand wolverine was decent but really not worth the watch and the last stand was fucking atrocious in about a million different waysi could be misremembering though i dont know much about what went on to make those movies and whatnot other than that hugh jackson is a beastarya is my favourite character in the show and maisie williams is my fave actor so i really want to see her featured a lot this year i just hope they dont have him standing around during the scenes with the brotherhood i actually want to see her interact with thoros and beric instead of standing in the background as they talk to each otherthis is perhaps why they brought the hound back so early edit to add so they know who she is and therefore theres the drama of the bwb not wanting to let them go or anythingi also hope they dont have the hound take over her scenes with the brotherhood obviously he will take centre stage during his trial and hope melisandre shows up after she has gone instead of taking over her storyi doubt it i expect the next episode will consist of him revealing who she is getting his ass kicked and then leaving and then the hound not reappearing again till the end of the sixth episode or so just my predictioni would also love to see her at the twins and would love for the episode to end with the hound hitting her so everyone thinks she has been killed if they dont feature her at the rw then i will be very disappointedagreed on her being there she doesnt have to get hit though i dont think otherwise audiences will wonder why shes been a pov character for so long to begin with if they suspect her deadif a certain story arc doesnt translate to tv very well they should cut it i feel like the whole jonnights watch story has been way too overemphazised at this point because it has not been very rewarding lacks a sense of direction and is basicly just there so we can have the battle of castle black and jon becoming the commander in the next season sams scene in this episode was another great example of a scene that lacked tone and purpose did we need another scene where sam is belittled for being fat it had the potential to expand the relationships between the characters when sam started to cry and asked why the left him i thought it was going to lead to a genuine moment of character bonding but instead it ends with ed or whats his name again cracking another youre fat and useless line so was this scene supposed to make us laught i dont know what to feel give me a tone ddyeah my three nonbook readers at the end of season one were all super pumped for dany and jons arks in season two more than any seven kingdoms plots yet throughout the second season and the first two episodes of season 3 they all took those jon and dany scenes as their break to check their cell phones and rest their eyes no jokeplus not to mention the laughability of jon assimilating into the wildlings being so unbelievable and the pointless waste of time ygritte flrting with jon was and how hilarious every dany scene ever was in how awful they all wereand now i have stumbled upon another problem it feels like the characters are repeating themselves way too much i have never heard ed deliver a single line that is not basicly yo sam you suck and i tell you this because were bros delivered with the exact same tone and speechrythm it was funny the first couple of times now its just starting to feel annoying and old this even applies to central characters like joffery since he became king i dont think we have had a single scene between him and cerscei and some other characters namely tyrion in s2 that doesnt end with him saying something that translates to im am teh king i can do what i want dont tell me what to do ok i know this is intentional to show us how cerscei is losing control over joffery and realizing that she has created a monster that she cant control but it becomes repetitive and leaves the impression that the character only has one note to playi am so fucking bored with joffreythe problem with the show and jack is jack is such a phenomenal actor that he just owns the role and makes everyone hate him but since hes older and since hes such an amazing actor the show has to make him be more the driving evil in kl and not cersei but this is counterproductive to the plot since all joffrey really does in acok and asos is throw pissyfits beat sansa and shoot his crossbow and die in hindsight joffrey was mainly just a puppet and was more or less a decoy antagonist in the same way viserys was in the first bookid be fine if the show managed to write around it to keep older show joffrey in control instead of his mother and if he did stuff but he doesnt i think there may have been more of joff in the first two eps of season 3 than any other character in that two episode period which is not rightas for sam yeah no fucks given about that plot there were about ten fb statuses that appeared on my newsfeed about the major da fuck game of thrones regarding that cliffhanger  opening no one was pleased with that cop outin season 2 i felt like i was going to throw up everytime daenerys went into a dramatic rant about being the blood of the dragon and how she would conquer the world whenever someone didnt give her what she wantedyeah fuck anything and everything dany in the second season including dany herself winkpng

"Maester Ruin",2013-04-11,"i dont know if this was supposed to be an answer to my post ive seen you respond to people without quoting them when youre posting after them but the post seems to not contain responses to a lot of what i wroteas for what you wrote here i think you skip over a lot of important things that happen jon becoming commander is not more relevant than that we learn that the wildlings have united for fear of the white walkers or that the white walkers represent a threat that a big part of the nights watch was just slaughtered by them weve also learned that the wws arent just killing everything jon will be learning new things breaking new vows and viewers will wonder whether hell be returning to the nw at all sam is shown to be the coward that will ultimately fail for the first time since first season unless i forgot something in season 2 its a natural set up for whats to come for him as he will prove himself later onif you havent heard edd say something thats not bad about sam then youre not paying any attention that could be a significant part in why you have trouble enjoying it as for joffrey he is pretty much all about doing exactly what he wants because hes king in the novels but still apart from his sadistic and entitled side the show is showing us his fearful and insecure side as welland if you have such overly dramatic reactions like in your last sentence im not really sure why youre watching id never watch anything that i found to be that bad so i have a hard time relatingi know that these scenes exist to give us information or set things up for coming events and that is my entire issue if you study screenwriting you learn pretty early on that you want to avoid creating scenes that only exist to provide expositional dialogue if a scene is there simply to feed us with information and keep the plot going without being able to stand on its own as an interestingemotional scene the audience will get bored very quickly and stop caring about whatever you are trying to tell them that is my issue with the jon arc in the series and especially the scenes in this episode they are just expositional dialogue there to tell us whats going on or in the case of orell teach us more about warging but the scenes themselves arent very interesting or engaging"

"Tywin's bastard",2013-04-11,"its not the violence or the climax thats important its the suspense of who is where with whom where are they moving next will they win oh what happens now that the ironmen are attacking the north oh i wonder if dorne will side with renly or what etci find anything militaristic and strategic in the books to be the most suspenseful aspect of the entire series and even if we only learn a few details about specific battles i have enough imagination to make it even better in my own mind than reading about it except when necessary like the blackwater and the nw battlesthats just like my opinion though if a show entirely centered around a story about war being horrible and pointless decides to complete bypass everything you know war in exchange for soap opera tyrionandshae robbandwhatsherface rosandlittlefinger scenes then i guess the show just never understood the books to begin withof course it will be a bigger sense of lacking in the show if thats your favorite parts of the books personally i think the story is all about the characters and that the overall story is just background for them to develop in i of course enjoy a lot of facets of the books and i think everyone can decide for themselves what the books are aboutto be fair those scenes were rather long and dreary and were just jaime japping around also lol  some random villager having seen jaime lannister before and running into locke and knowing where jaime was exactly just all around lol to that whole thingevery jaime lannister scene from season two was awful though great acting and such just terrible writingthats pretty much exactly what it was in the books but longer their conversations tell you a lot about the characters as well so theres a lot going on unless you cant sit still during the parts without actionas for your comments about the villager i dont see the strange part at all if youre a party out searching for someone you will of course ask everyone you meet if theyve seen who youre looking for locke will of course have figured out which areas they will most likely travel through and because he is in the area its not completely unlikely that hell run into a villager that isnt hiding from them who could tell you where he saw them and in which direction they were travelling at the time why do you think that the villager knew exactly where they were that seems like a pretty dumb conclusion to draw instead of that locke boltons best tracker used his information to find themwhat do you think would have made more sense that locke actually was tracking their footprints that its more likely that he runs into the two thats trying to hide from armed men than a villager i find no other option more likely some about equal but they dont necessarily present any moral choices like this one didreally from a scene transition standpoint it really feels like theres no flow in season twoor three to me but when it comes to like the scenes themselves in the first season every episode had its own ark for select scenes by a certain character secondthird seasons theres no inepisode ark its just random scenesfrom both a cinematic standpoint and a plot standpoint i see no way it flows better nowyes really not much to say if you dont even remember the most obvious ones like how season 2 used the comet to bring a more coherent line between the different places i also think that more scenes get the time to breathe after the first season and this is despite that i think the first season is better than the second that goes mainly because i think the story in the first is better and more easily told but i think the craftsmanship in the second beats the first pretty clearlythese are all wishful thinking obviously whats done is done and obviously it wasnt my show but still i can dream as for the nudity theres definitely more of it in the show than in all five of the books put together as to the descriptiveness youre right some of the sex scenes are definitely more vivid than whats shown in the show  but with text comes metaphors symbolism insight into characters thoughts etc so sex sceneswhether tragic horrifying or lovely can all be quite beautiful in their own way sex scenes in tv or film can be as well but i dont believe there has been a single nudity scene in the show thus far that i consider artistic except perhaps theon on the boat with the wench that scene was brilliantly done and well acted and gave us a good insight into theon and an excellent parallel as he gets bitched slapped around for the rest of the seasonwe can dream but i dont really see the point of dragging up impossible dreams in discussions seems like a road to nowhereas for the sex scenes there has hardly been any in two seasons that were to just show sextwo people wanting each other as many movies and shows do nearly all scenes with nudity in got were about something completely different some people arent comfortable with nudity so they can get jarred out of what the scene is really about but for me that was never a problem hence that the show gave birth to the term sexposition because it was never about the sexim just basing this all off my roomies who only watched the show havent rewatched the show since last year and havent read the books well one read the first 400 pages of agot and got bored and stopped but he doesnt countpeople just dont understand who is who what is what as easily as people whove watched the show multiple times through thus far and read the books hell it wasnt until i was at the very end of season two before i realized who roose bolton was in the show i just thought it was some nameless generalnaturally not all people will be able to keep up something that also goes for the books i dont see it as a general problem with that the show doesnt tell us things though i just think that the show assumes that the audience can think and forces them to make a bit of an effort to get everything it should be an aspect you like since you felt that it was dumbed down with the strategic thingsas for roose bolton they both name him and he has his sigil on his armor so i think the show presented him well especially as he wasnt very important that seasonwasnt david behind both wolverine and the last stand wolverine was decent but really not worth the watch and the last stand was fucking atrocious in about a million different waysi could be misremembering though i dont know much about what went on to make those movies and whatnot other than that hugh jackson is a beastno he hasnt had anything to do with the xmen series i dont remember where i read that his script was changed very significantly by others before being used but ive seen it at a few places as for the movies i liked

time to breath though much shorter scenes in a spuratic order and moving at a super lightning face pace for no reason and not focusing on individual characters undermine the whole experience that last bit is something you should appreciate particularly since you like characterswe can dream but i dont really see the point of dragging up impossible dreams in discussions seems like a road to

the last stand more than wolverine neither was very good but i enjoyed some parts of tls mainly ian mckellen as magnetodidnt really enjoy much of either but the acting in wolverine was very good the last stand was an all around joke making rogue give up her powers really ugh thats just the peak of my disgust with that movie which is hilarious since xmen united and first class were fucking brilliantbut yeah dont really know much about davids involvement with the xmen movies other than that he was involved somehowanyone that knows arya can identify her why is she got to be betrayed by someone from winterfell that she knows be so importantarya has 9 chapters in sos before the rw all these chapters take place over weeks and often multiple locations like acorn hill high heart lady of leaves place etc id expect some of her story to have to be cut if shes going to do the important stuff in her arcall this exactly besides introducing arya early and getting the duel done nice and early it means sandor can disappear for a few episodes after next episode before returning whereas in the book he returned the very next chapter all around agree with this creative choiceas for mel ill have to see how they handle this before making an opinionyou and i disagree wildly regarding the books so diametric are our opinions that i doubt we could ever reach a middle ground but since all opinions are subjective im quite happy to leave it at thatfair enough hahabut the series doesnt follow the strict pov narrative of the books she is still a pretty central character in the story even if we only see her through other characters eyes in the books so it makes sense to give her a proper introduction if we were to follow the strict narratives from the books we would have missed out on a ton of great sceneseh only a handful of great scenesi agree about season 1 but i do think season 2 had some engaging scenes the scenes between cerscei and tyrion were very well acted and had some emotional depth to them and i thought theons faceoff with balon you gave me away remember the day you bent the knee to robert baratheon after he crushed you did he take what was yours then was intense

"lostinwesteros",2013-04-11,"i think that the action is being rushed with the result that much of the essential information is omitted thus causing the action to be a bit all over the place some of the additions i liked margaery and joff with the cross bow  loved how she played him but not the bit with tyrion and shae or the bit with cat and talisa definitely two of my least favority characters liked the way they handled jojen and meeras introduction  thought they quickly and succinctly provided much needed material even a great setup for later on via the rebellion discussion but thought that aryas scenes were rushed and i really really hope they dont do that with the aryasandor scenes or with the rest of the jaimebrienne scenes"
"Tywin's bastard",2013-04-11,"the show guts everything military they gut more or less all sense of what the commoners and soldiers are dealing with it guts all prophecies it alters nearly every damn character it omits major plot points and game players and historical details etc etcthe only thing the show goes all out on is terrible soap opera romancewhich nobody likes and shitloads of nudity for shtis and giggles which most people disapprove of at least some ofand yet this is one of the more faithful adaptations ive seen when taken into context how extremely difficult this story is to translate into a different medium a lot of complaints seem to rely very much on unrealistic expectations and being too attached to the original work and its always a shame to foil yourself i absolutely love the book series but ive felt it natural not to expect too much from an adaptation since even simple stories are never as good as a good book in my viewas for the specifics it feels pretty natural to not focus that much on what happens to those that arent important characters when they dont have even remotely enough time to spend on those do show whats in the books the story needs to be abbreviated which at some times mean shortening things and at other times removing things entirely as for prophecies weve already been told that they are pushed closer to when they matter but they will still be in although im guessing not all of them of courseyour last sentence reminds me that you seem pretty inclined to write your opinions as if they were facts which they are notshowing brienne this way was kind of weird though they had no problem with brienne slaying two of renlys guards and random northern mendespite her never killing anyone yet at this point in the show yet she was willing to let a villager live despite her oaths and the dangers the show has depicted bri one way then turned back and painted her the original wayits contradictary and frustrating the villager dilema id like more if brienne was obviously against killing and such in the show too shrugso you mean that its strange that shes willing to kill men that are actively trying to kill her after trying to avoid it first when it comes to the northmen but that she isnt willing to kill someone for just walking by and being nice i dont see any contradiction or lack of logic here in fact id say that most humans would be willing to fight for their lives but not be willing to murder someone in cold bloodi actually wish it was the way it was tywins former bannerman run into them by chance jaime is convinced hes saved only to be absolutely devasted when he was so wrong and when he loses his armbeing hunted is kind of lolzie since its a whole continent and all and while their destination is obviously south theylocke have no idea how theyre going to get thereagain we reach the point of pretty irrelevant wishes they arent going to spend the time showing a sellsword company to establish them and how they are switching sides so that part just never had any real chance of happeningwhy would being hunted be strange they know where they are going and they know what paths are the most probable making the argument that theres a whole continent pretty moot they can travel a lot faster and they can ask people who might have seen them its not an easy task but a lot stranger things and coincidences happen in this storyi actually found the red commet to be horribly jarring and vastly no where nearly as cool or creative as it was in the book i appreciate what they were trying but ehi dont know what you mean by giving scenes time to breath though much shorter scenes in a spuratic order and moving at a super lightning face pace for no reason and not focusing on individual characters undermine the whole experience that last bit is something you should appreciate particularly since you like charactersi dont think well come any closer on this point as i said it was common to see reviews talking about the better flow and coherence of the second season so its been noted by a lot of people if you didnt like it thats just how it is as its about tastesome people like hypothetical situations especially myself since im an aspiring author and screenwriter and i like to think about what i dodont like in stories what i wouldve done different if i could etcit is a road to no where but its a good way to examine whether or not a story actually makes sense or not and good practice for storycrafting in your headtheres nothing bad about it in itself i just dont think it adds anything to the discussion about whats actually in therei dont agree with the second sentence though comparing it to the book doesnt show anything in particular about making sense the scenes must be taken into the context of what the show has told usit was about tits and pointless exposition together as one in some cases it worked like with the tyrion intro scene in the absolute first episode or in viserys tub scene most of the time it was terrible particularly awful was littlefingers storytime to two lesbiansagain a matter of opinion and i disagree but of course nudity is used deliberately as everything else thats shown watching true blood made me realize even more how little got sex scenes try to arouse the viewer in comparison theres a show that really shows sex for the sole purpose of showing sexi would like it if this is the way it was outside of the fact that it results in the show making it seem like theres a major war going on and that everyones sitting around doing nothingthats not the impression im gettingnone of my room mates know his name his sigil or what where his seat is located its obvious for book readers but nonreaders dont have any fucking cluei wrote about roose because you said that you didnt figure out who he was until late in the season i just showed that the information was there and you shouldnt be lumping all nonreaders into the same category i know a couple who got his name and understood that he was a bannerman to robb its not easy to get since theres a ton of information coming in a steady stream but its not the same thing as to say that no one has a clue about who he isdidnt really enjoy much of either but the acting in wolverine was very good the last stand was an all around joke making rogue give up her powers really ugh thats just the peak of my disgust with that movie which is hilarious since xmen united and first class were fucking brilliantbut yeah dont really know much about davids involvement with the xmen movies other than that he was involved somehowi think killing xavier was far worse than the rogue thing at least parts of he hate her powers while the other thing was just killing one of the best acted characters i agree that xmen 2 and first class were really good magneto is one of the best acted characters in superhero movies despite being portrayed by two different peopleits a bit fun that david is somewhat known as a writer for wolverine and troy and from what ive heard both of those scripts were altered quite a bit by others before used and in both cases the rumors seem to be that it was for the worse likely due to the studio demanding thingsas a final note i do get a bit surprised that youre still watching the show since you seem to mainly have gripes with it and you use quite strong language to describe those so they seem to be really significant im not telling you what to do or anything i just personally dont think it seems really worth it to watch something that actively annoys me there can of course also just be a difference in focus between you and me i dont like everything on the show either but i tend to focus mostly on what i do like since that kind of thinking makes it easier to be entertained edited by tywins bastard 11 april 2013  0303 pm"

"Maester Ruin",2013-04-11,"it couldve happened if they had more episodes did roose boltonramsay correctly did arya correct etc but yeah i see your pointi have to point out that the scenes between arya and tywin were simply brilliant one of the better changesdevations the show has made the acting was wonderful williams and dance are two of my favourites and to put them togheter was amazing and it felt like the audience got to know tywin who lets face it was a much more important character than roose at the time and they even managed to squeeze in a little bit about his childhood and tythos without making it feel like forced exposition it was one of the highpoints of the season in my opinion"
"The Mountain That Posts",2013-04-11,"they were great scenes well executed the lines were well done and brilliantly acted but as a whole theyre quite detrimental to the arya and even tywin arks imo shrugs"
"PetyrPunkinhead",2013-04-11,"hey guysstorm of swords is one of my favorite books of alltime and when they said they would be splitting it into two season i thought for certain this would mean they would fit more inmy favorite storyline in the book is by far jaimes in the book he and brienne have 3 full chapter which a pretty long at that before they are captured by lord vargo in this season we were given one scene that was masterful and the duel that was underwhelming why not flesh out these two before being captured i know they had some scenes at the end of last season but i feel shortchanged on the best duo in the seriesi also love arya and the brotherhood without banners i knwo we cant expect them to cast all the member of the brotherhood but i really wish they would have kept around tom osevens and thoros greenbeard lem the huntsman and some of the others may have been too much but certainly harwin being a winterfell man should have been includedand they have already captured the hound this takes fairly later in aryas journey i hope we get to see more of the brotherhoodmy thoughts exactly people are already thinking jaimes injury at the hands of vargo are coming in episode 3 thats just crazy to me arya coming in to contact w the hound earlier is a bit more forgivable to me seeing as how their relationship progresses in the book"

the plot and characters workit depends on how you view it that it will naturally be worse than the books if the books are good isnt really a negative unless you fail to set your expectations according to thati also disagree on the goal of adaptations its not in any way necessary to expand on the original id actually say that most adaptations do the opposite i dont think ive ever read a book and then seen a movieshow on it that didnt cut things if you have some examples of books whos story got bigger and more complex in the translation id be interested to hear it the main goal as i see it is to provide a different experience something that can both provide variety to those already familiar with it and reach a completely new audience that arent readers even though you dont seem to think so theres millions of people that do seem to think this adaptation worksi wouldnt say im too attached to the original books specifically hell there are loads that if i was grrm i myself wouldve done differently shrugsthat was a general comment of mine not really directed toward you that said youve made it sound like you are pretty attached to it in some arguments being very focused on what happened in the book when discussing certain events despite that its highly unlikely that it would have been used that waylol  prophecies in the show zomg seas coming to wash us away next episode theon smooth show almost fooled methats quite clearly not part of what i was talking about not that i see whats wrong with that it serves as nothing more than a little hint about whats to come and given what you say your nonreader friends have missed or even yourself this is still far more subtle than those and why would they need to drag it out longer in the book pacing translated into ten episodes it would have happened in consecutive episodes as well not to mention that two chapters after the bran chapter in question theres a theon chapter where the cliffhanger is how he tells his men that its not torrhens square he means to take if you get the symbolism of the dream you get whats happening in the span of three chapters in the bookoh not true at all while i do think it is near factual that everyone is disgusted by the existence of ros and nearly every littlefinger brothel scene doesnt mean i consider anything im saying as factual its all subjective and hypothetical and all thatits obviously not near factual mainly it would be book readers that are annoyed with her not nonreaders and not all of them are annoyed either im not as i understand that shes there to create opportunities to tell things that are only shown through thought in the books thats pretty obvious to me and what im referring to is that you write this is how it is rather than stating opinions it gets a bit tiresome especially together with your derogatory attitude to everything you dont like if i had done the same and had an attitude where i laugh at and insult the viewers youve mentioned etc i think this discussion would have been less productivein the book she avoided to kill renlys guards or anyone who came after her postleaving riverrun i swear people who make tv shows need to go watch

life its a pretty big deal and yes for all intents and purposes killing a peaceful man is the same as killing armed assailants because either way you risk your life ending because of itlets just say we strongly disagree then if you think people react the same way in stress while someone armed is actively trying to kill them as they do when they calmly assess if they should kill an unarmed man that has a slight chance of posing a threat then i just dont know what to say my experiences as a martial artist and mandatory military service dont agree with you as would i say that the laws of most countries would look different if people didnt react differently in such situations we have self defense laws etcjaime and brienne just left riverrun while there are select paths they were likely to take and their ultimate destination could be casterly rock could be highgarden or could be kings landing theres simply too many fucking directions from riverrun they couldve went in so one hunting party and happening to track them down hilariously unbelievablethey know jaime was freed to be traded for sansa and arya in that situation it makes the most sense that he was taken to kings landing or at least tywins army who would be about on the road to kl thats just going by what were shown for all we know robb could have gotten catelyn to say right out that she sent brienne with jaime to kings landingtheres nothing saying that theres just one hunting party either we only hear from bolton and he says he has his best hunter on it if you just go by his words theres only one man looking for him but we see that its obviously not the case that means that he can be in charge of a hunting force thats spread out in various locations as you say we arent really getting the tactical and strategic details on the show the way you argue you sound like someone that actively tries to find fault rather than possible solutionsand even in context many scenes simply dont make sense everything samwell hasnt been making sense the battle of blackwater makes zero sense littlefingers jetpack from place to place makes no sense everything dany makes no sense etcnot much point in answering this since you dont go into any specifics i can just say that i think youre wrong againand the scene of theon fucking a chick followed by ittlefinger watching like half a dozen whores in his house all naked followed

"callmedodge",2013-04-15,"its funny to see people say they want more complete character arcs intraepisode and then go on to complain thats its moving too quickly seasons 2 main problem is that we got sporadic scenes not really moving the plot along a lot in that episode for too many characters so far this season i feel theyve done a much better job of focusing on fewer characters per episode and actually moving along their arcs and then go on to complain that you cant have certain characters missing for 3 or 4 episodes would you rather have them in there with a pointless talking scene  something theres been a lot of complaining about with a show this size it is simply not possible to include everyone in each episode and have complete character arcs in each episode and have it feel like it isnt progressing quickly some things come at the sacrifice of others im afraid and as soon as bookviewers get that into their head the quicker theyll be able to enjoy the damned show"

"Iotun",2013-04-09,"i dont understand people who say that the pw doesnt make any sense to be in season 3 and that it wont fit the plot i actually think its the other way round the pw makes perfect sense because it neatly serves as a scense change climax and start of a different chapter for all the characters in kli think people who think the pw should be in season 4 dont really think of the show as a tv product and the seasons as distinct entities in themselves but rather think of season 3 and season 4 as the seasons to throw things into from the books in tv seasons must be self contained and complete an arc in themselves for their characters a season is typically structured to have an introduction where things move onwards from the old season and the characters take a step into a new direction and find themselves in new and interesting circumstances then a buildup a climax for the characters then a chapter close where the characters take a next move into the new situation they will find themselves in at the next seasons start you cant have characters who dont build up to anything all season and sort of stay there doing nothing at the season climax you cant have a new season start with the characters being pretty much exactly where they were you cant have a season climax in episode 3 or 4 of a new season having been build up over one and a half years with a years break in between then a slowdown for major characters again so that you build a second climax in episodes 8 and 9 of the same season having the pw in season 4 makes the storylines of cercei tyrion sansa jaime margaery the qot very awkard really think of this what will jaime be doing for the first half of season 4 jaime can only arrive in kings landing after joffrey has been killed so what can he be doing for the first hallf of the season doesnt it make much more sense for him to finish his story 3 arc right as hes coming into kings landing and then start season 4 with him right when he comes into the city the only reason to have it in season 4 seems to be some obsessive purist concern to have oberyns introduction play exactly as it did in the books when it can be handled so much better otherwisewe had a long thread on the subject back in the general discussion so as not to retype my arguments again ill just quote my post from that thread below written just after the end of season 2 i actually think that so far with what little we are seeing of season 3 my predictions in it are coming trueim so confident that the pw will be in season 3 im willing to bet money on it thats right and im dead serious anybody who think itll be season 4 ill gladly take that bet on and im confident ill wini think people who think itll be in season 4 think too much in book terms and that s3 and s4 are just two vehicles to staff material from the book into but each season must be a complete entity in itself thats no longer just part of the season that must contain the events of book 3 it all boils down to this  the pw in season 4 makes for very convoluted and jarring story arcs in season 4 and very unsatisfactory ones in season 3 with it in season 3 it all fits togetherthe arguments against the pw in season 3 are artificial and book centeredoberyn martell needs to be in the pw and he doesnt come in until season 4 no not really this is the same argument that the burning of winterfell would not have happened in season 2 because reek wasnt introduced it is silly this is the show that has taken 2 seasons to introduce edmure and the tullys that hasnt introduced the greyjoy brothers yet who removed reek from winterfell who is giving us the reeds in season 3 at the end of the day oberyn is important for one thing  to champion tyrion not for being at the wedding oberyn may had been coming to kings landing to review dornes fealty to the crown as a gesture of goodwill after receiving myrcella in a random visit theres no need whatsoever for him to be coming for the wedding and his reception could simply be given to jaime rather than tyriontoo much will be shoved into season 3 if the pw is in it too again not really id argue to the contrary  not too much will be in season 3 a season which dd have stated theyve been waiting for to do and thered be too much in season 4 that makes sense looking at the arguments why itd be in season 3why season 3it simply makes sense as an overall story arc and overriding theme for season 3 with the main theme being the weddings from the aftermath of robbs wedding to talysa to the 3 weddings at the end without the pw the season just feels flat for many of the characters with loras and margaery having been build up as major chracters what will they be doing and building up to the whole season what will cersei and joffrey you have a fairly significant actress coming in to play the queen of thorns who comes into the season and ends up doing nothing much these are all major characters and their storylines will just kinda<U+0080> stay there just because the robb camp has a major event doesnt mean the kl camp has to stay in one place even tyrion and sansa you could argue that their big moment is their own wedding<U+0080> but you cant have their story climax in episode 8 and then have nothing for them in the last 2 episodes especially given that theyre primary characters in the show their own wedding is also an unsatifactory conclusion for them if the wedding between tyrion and sansa is meant to be the climax for their story and an important point then just voiding that in the first 2 or 3 episodes of season 4 just makes it fall flat on its face so much<U+0080> neater for their arc to end with sansa escaping the red keep and tyrion being accused for joffreys murder it just so better points to the ridiculousness of the whole charade of them being married just two episodes back and gives a climax to all stories margaery and loras have actual arc which end with them killing the king the queen of thorns ends on a high as she is revealed to be the person orchestrating the murder behind the scenes cerceis arc ends with the loss of her son and effectively her loss against the tyrellss in the game joffreys ends with him well dying etcit also parallels so beautifully with the rw  the dual tragedy in both camps it makes sense dramatically both camps have been preparing for important weddings that would seal alliances the whole season both end in tragedy joffrey boasting about the events that happened in just the previous episode finally gets what happens to him at the season end with the rw causing an uproar in episode 9 and a probably very vocal outrage from the fans who havent read the books how can dd not go for the double punch  and end with yet another big event as the season finisher on the one hand they have the chance to do tv history to do a truly dramatic two episode punch to the face and on the other hand episode 10 just sort of ties things together and whats there to tie in kings landing the outcome of a deflated wedding for tyrion and the other parties doing nothing much joffreys death is a very big and very emotionally satisfying event  but theyll just leave it for an episode 2 or episode 3 of the next season and then if it is season 4 are the interested parties lannisters and tyrrells going to be preparing for the wedding for just the first one or two episodes of season 4 given that margaery arrived in kl at the end of season 2 its expected there will be talk of her wedding all through season 3 this will parallel the talk of the wedding with the freys the queen of thorns in season 3 is almost definitely going to have her scene with sansa where she confides to her that joffrey is a monster which will become the seed for the tyrell resolution that joffrey must die so are dd just going to be saying oh weve been talking about and building up to this big event in kl the whole of season 3 but you know actually were just not going to show it well just show it in episode 3 of the next season it just doesnt make dramatic sense after the wedding is the audience expected to recall the conversation between the qot and sansa from the previous season and ties things together or are the two events more likely to be put together in the same season the only reason to keep it in season 4 is for some pure adherence to book timelines which theyve shown they dont care aboutin a similar way jaimes storyline otherwise makes no sense for season 3 jaimes season 3 storyline makes much more sense with him ending his journey both physically and emotionally with him arriving in kings landing but jaime must arrive after joffrey has died if not because of the book plotline simply because it goes against jaimes character to be at the wedding where joffrey dies and then allow joffrey to mock tyrion or tyrion to be arrested so if we put joffrey dying in the start of season 4 then jaimes story in season 3 just ends<U+0080> somewhere but not really anywhereand yes it is true that otherwise the season will end up just being to depressing and make fans angry who only see the bad guys win remember we wont just have the rw were also likely to have ygritte dying in episode 9 or 10 which will also be a major depressing event and theon who granted is not a very sympathetic character but is still much more likeable than the bastard of bolton facing some unspeakable torture at the hands of the latter dd will be seriously in risk of losing viewers if they just end the whole season with most of the good guys having depressing losses people being tortured at the hands of sadists love pairings being torn apart and all the bad guys winning even in danys storyline we risk seeing it end with her exiling jorah though personally i think thatll be the climax of season 4similarly putting the pw in season 4 makes that season very confusing story arcs will just come and go sansas cerceis and tyrions storyline will have a massive spike two episodes in then kind of deflate then just have another spike joffrey rather than having an arc will just show up for 2 episodes then die off and thatll be it  as if joffrey is not one of the key characters of the show that deserves his death with all the emotional appeal that will have to be featured prominently in a season finale all these characters dont have proper beginning middle and end points in their arcs for season 4 instead their real starts will be a few episodes into the season with the first episodes just sort of not really that important instead so much more neater to start cercei right after shes lost joffrey tyrion in prison and sansa arriving at the vale and see their stories from that point its also so much neater for jaimes story as well right at the start we get introduced to the martells in dorne and oberyn arriving in kl for<U+0080> whatever reason ive listed several possible ones above and is met by a recently arrived jaime the main season thread i see for s4 is  people leaving and converging together arya will finish s4 leaving for braavos tyrion will be leaving for pentos doran will reveal that hes been plotting the targaryen return and has send his son to find dany sam will be leaving for oldtown and well be starting to see the threads of the stories from east and west finally starting convergingand to all those who think theres just not enough to fit in s4  i beg to disagree for jon i think season 3 will end with ygritte dying in his arms and season 4 will have the battle for the wall the arrival of stannis and mel and him being voted commander of the watch plenty there including a major battle for tyrion cercei jaime theres the emotional triangle between the three which only really works as a major point if the season starts with it jaime just coming into the city just as tyrion is put in prison based on cerceis accusations jaimes conflicting loyalties leading to his helping his brother rather than staying loyal to his sister the interactions of all 3 with oberyn the trial the murder of tywin the escape if jaime could spend most of season 2 in a cell so can tyrion and in fact tyrion has a lot more chance for interactions with other characters than jaime did in season 4 plenty there for all characters and not even getting into cerceis chapters from book 4 arya who i believe will end season 3 with being captured by the hound at the end of season 3 can have her travels with the hound expanded on in season 4 and her story ending with her leaving westeros to be trained as a fm plenty there and for dany  actually my theory is that mereen and astapor will not in fact be merged and that in fact meereen its siege and capture will be expanded on and cover the entirety of season 4 i believe n season 3 meereen will be build up as the capital of slaver bay strong and impenetrable and dany will be convinced not to attack it but at the final episode as she is marching with her army she sees the first of the children crucified with its hand pointing to meereen and the season will end with her turning her horse around and riding with her army away as a crucified child points to her the way where season 3 was dany builds her army season 4 will be dany the conqueror and only season 5 will be dany the leasder and season 4 will end with her at the top of the great pyramid of meereen while exiling jorah a lot there as well including a major battle edited by iotun 09 april 2013  0413 am"

"Iotun",2013-04-09,"pw could well be in the same episode as the rw leaving mhyssa and uncat in episode 10 they would have to tweak the timelines and plot logic a bit but i think it would be pretty awesome by the way there were comments at the start of the season that book readers would be very surprised this season as well and that there will be some deviations from the books actually the more i think of this the more i like it from the trailers i take it that joeffreys everybody is miine to torment will be made before he learns of the red wedding so the only other significant event that needs to happen in kings landing before the pw but after the rw is i think just tywin having a converstation with somebody explaining the lannister involvement in the rw lots of people could fill that role tyrion in the cells cercei lady olenna theres a long list and it could happen after the pw i think it would make for one awesome episode 9 what if paralleling blackwater they had one episode that was centred strictly on the two weddings and strictly on two locations the twins and kings landing i think if handled well it would make for awesome television edited to add this is what will happen im feeling really confident about it now edited by iotun 09 april 2013  0458 am"

"Lord Varys",2013-04-09,"its obvious that the show runners are intending to create a new dynamic in kl this season they are highlighting margaery and establish not only her rivalry with cersei but also her relationship with joffrey which means that they may either show us some final fallout between margaery and joffrey or much more likely we are going to see how joffrey falls for margaery and is still murdered lady olennas a pity strongly suggests that joffreys fate was sealed in that very moment just as it was in the book more importantly they seem to set up the eventual tyrionsansa marriage as huge game changer in the shaesansa and the shaetyrion relationship combine this with the aftermath of the red wedding and its pretty obvious that they are going to stretch out the unhappy sansatyrion marriage for as long as they can would the pw happen this season there would be only one episode between tyrions marriage and his incarceration and separation from sansa this is not going to happen and by the way who wants tyrion to meet with oberyn in the dungeon who wants tyrion in prison for most of a season no one if the purple wedding is going to happen this season there will be no oberyn in season 4 of that im sure"

"RememberTheNorth",2013-04-09,"a death at a wedding again cant the show think of something new weve seen the same thing last year are we expected to be surprised again i would have to disagree as someone else said on here it would be far more ridiculous for two death weddings to happen back to back also the other comment about the oberyn scene being not needed because it is 1015 minutes is interesting although this is not an issue either i remember someone on another thread putting it beautuflly basically the writers on this show are put to a tremendous task of being able to put huge book conversations into a few simple lines that are watched and fully understood by show viewers qots scene with sansa was a great example it went into tremendous detail and lasted for a large pov chapter but the show scene was barely a few lines structurally speaking if the wedding is put in this season im sure the writers will have a good reason although this is an end which i cannot rationalize as being entirely logical"
"MoAt",2013-04-09,"i dont understand people who say that the pw doesnt make any sense to be in season 3 and that it wont fit the plot i actually think its the other way round the pw makes perfect sense because it neatly serves as a scense change climax and start of a different chapter for all the characters in kli think people who think the pw should be in season 4 dont really think of the show as a tv product and the seasons as distinct entities in themselves but rather think of season 3 and season 4 as the seasons to throw things into from the books in tv seasons must be self contained and complete an arc in themselves for their characters a season is typically structured to have an introduction where things move onwards from the old season and the characters take a step into a new direction and find themselves in new and interesting circumstances then a buildup a climax for the characters then a chapter close where the characters take a next move into the new situation they will find themselves in at the next seasons start you cant have characters who dont build up to anything all season and sort of stay there doing nothing at the season climax you cant have a new season start with the characters being pretty much exactly where they were you cant have a season climax in episode 3 or 4 of a new season having been build up over one and a half years with a years break in between then a slowdown for major characters again so that you build a second climax in episodes 8 and 9 of the same season having the pw in season 4 makes the storylines of cercei tyrion sansa jaime margaery the qot very awkard really think of this what will jaime be doing for the first half of season 4 jaime can only arrive in kings landing after joffrey has been killed so what can he be doing for the first hallf of the season doesnt it make much more sense for him to finish his story 3 arc right as hes coming into kings landing and then start season 4 with him right when he comes into the city the only reason to have it in season 4 seems to be some obsessive purist concern to have oberyns introduction play exactly as it did in the books when it can be handled so much better otherwisewe had a long thread on the subject back in the general discussion so as not to retype my arguments again ill just quote my post from that thread below written just after the end of season 2 i actually think that so far with what little we are seeing of season 3 my predictions in it are coming trueim so confident that the pw will be in season 3 im willing to bet money on it thats right and im dead serious anybody who think itll be season 4 ill gladly take that bet on and im confident ill wini think people who think itll be in season 4 think too much in book terms and that s3 and s4 are just two vehicles to staff material from the book into but each season must be a complete entity in itself thats no longer just part of the season that must contain the events of book 3 it all boils down to this  the pw in season 4 makes for very convoluted and jarring story arcs in season 4 and very unsatisfactory ones in season 3 with it in season 3 it all fits togetherthe arguments against the pw in season 3 are artificial and book centeredoberyn martell needs to be in the pw and he doesnt come in until season 4 no not really this is the same argument that the burning of winterfell would not have happened in season 2 because reek wasnt introduced it is silly this is the show that has taken 2 seasons to introduce edmure and the tullys that hasnt introduced the greyjoy brothers yet who removed reek from winterfell who is giving us the reeds in season 3 at the end of the day oberyn is important for one thing  to champion tyrion not for being at the wedding oberyn may had been coming to kings landing to review dornes fealty to the crown as a gesture of goodwill after receiving myrcella in a random visit theres no need whatsoever for him to be coming for the wedding and his reception could simply be given to jaime rather than tyriontoo much will be shoved into season 3 if the pw is in it too again not really id argue to the contrary  not too much will be in season 3 a season which dd have stated theyve been waiting for to do and thered be too much in season 4 that makes sense looking at the arguments why itd be in season 3why season 3it simply makes sense as an overall story arc and overriding theme for season 3 with the main theme being the weddings from the aftermath of robbs wedding to talysa to the 3 weddings at the end without the pw the season just feels flat for many of the characters with loras and margaery having been build up as major chracters what will they be doing and building up to the whole season what will cersei and joffrey you have a fairly significant actress coming in to play the queen of thorns who comes into the season and ends up doing nothing much these are all major characters and their storylines will just kinda<U+0080> stay there just because the robb camp has a major event doesnt mean the kl camp has to stay in one place even tyrion and sansa you could argue that their big moment is their own wedding<U+0080> but you cant have their story climax in episode 8 and then have nothing for them in the last 2 episodes especially given that theyre primary characters in the show their own wedding is also an unsatifactory conclusion for them if the wedding between tyrion and sansa is meant to be the climax for their story and an important point then just voiding that in the first 2 or 3 episodes of season 4 just makes it fall flat on its face so much<U+0080> neater for their arc to end with sansa escaping the red keep and tyrion being accused for joffreys murder it just so better points to the ridiculousness of the whole charade of them being married just two episodes back and gives a climax to all stories margaery and loras have actual arc which end with them killing the king the queen of thorns ends on a high as she is revealed to be the person orchestrating the murder behind the scenes cerceis arc ends with the loss of her son and effectively her loss against the tyrellss in the game joffreys ends with him well dying etcit also parallels so beautifully with the rw  the dual tragedy in both camps it makes sense dramatically both camps have been preparing for important weddings that would seal alliances the whole season both end in tragedy joffrey boasting about the events that happened in just the previous episode finally gets what happens to him at the season end with the rw causing an uproar in episode 9 and a probably very vocal outrage from the fans who havent read the books how can dd not go for the double punch  and end with yet another big event as the season finisher on the one hand they have the chance to do tv history to do a truly dramatic two episode punch to the face and on the other hand episode 10 just sort of ties things together and whats there to tie in kings landing the outcome of a deflated wedding for tyrion and the other parties doing nothing much joffreys death is a very big and very emotionally satisfying event  but theyll just leave it for an episode 2 or episode 3 of the next season and then if it is season 4 are the interested parties lannisters and tyrrells going to be preparing for the wedding for just the first one or two episodes of season 4 given that margaery arrived in kl at the end of season 2 its expected there will be talk of her wedding all through season 3 this will parallel the talk of the wedding with the freys the queen of thorns in season 3 is almost definitely going to have her scene with sansa where she confides to her that joffrey is a monster which will become the seed for the tyrell resolution that joffrey must die so are dd just going to be saying oh weve been talking about and building up to this big event in kl the whole of season 3 but you know actually were just not going to show it well just show it in episode 3 of the next season it just doesnt make dramatic sense after the wedding is the audience expected to recall the conversation between the qot and sansa from the previous season and ties things together or are the two events more likely to be put together in the same season the only reason to keep it in season 4 is for some pure adherence to book timelines which theyve shown they dont care aboutin a similar way jaimes storyline otherwise makes no sense for season 3 jaimes season 3 storyline makes much more sense with him ending his journey both physically and emotionally with him arriving in kings landing but jaime must arrive after joffrey has died if not because of the book plotline simply because it goes against jaimes character to be at the wedding where joffrey dies and then allow joffrey to mock tyrion or tyrion to be arrested so if we put joffrey dying in the start of season 4 then jaimes story in season 3 just ends<U+0080> somewhere but not really anywhereand yes it is true that otherwise the season will end up just being to depressing and make fans angry who only see the bad guys win remember we wont just have the rw were also likely to have ygritte dying in episode 9 or 10 which will also be a major depressing event and theon who granted is not a very sympathetic character but is still much more likeable than the bastard of bolton facing some unspeakable torture at the hands of the latter dd will be seriously in risk of losing viewers if they just end the whole season with most of the good guys having depressing losses people being tortured at the hands of sadists love pairings being torn apart and all the bad guys winning even in danys storyline we risk seeing it end with her exiling jorah though personally i think thatll be the climax of season 4similarly putting the pw in season 4 makes that season very confusing story arcs will just come and go sansas cerceis and tyrions storyline will have a massive spike two episodes in then kind of deflate then just have another spike joffrey rather than having an arc will just show up for 2 episodes then die off and thatll be it  as if joffrey is not one of the key characters of the show that deserves his death with all the emotional appeal that will have to be featured prominently in a season finale all these characters dont have proper beginning middle and end points in their arcs for season 4 instead their real starts will be a few episodes into the season with the first episodes just sort of not really that important instead so much more neater to start cercei right after shes lost joffrey tyrion in prison and sansa arriving at the vale and see their stories from that point its also so much neater for jaimes story as well right at the start we get introduced to the martells in dorne and oberyn arriving in kl for<U+0080> whatever reason ive listed several possible ones above and is met by a recently arrived jaime the main season thread i see for s4 is  people leaving and converging together arya will finish s4 leaving for braavos tyrion will be leaving for pentos doran will reveal that hes been plotting the targaryen return and has send his son to find dany sam will be leaving for oldtown and well be starting to see the threads of the stories from east and west finally starting convergingand to all those who think theres just not enough to fit in s4  i beg to disagree for jon i think season 3 will end with ygritte dying in his arms and season 4 will have the battle for the wall the arrival of stannis and mel and him being voted commander of the watch plenty there including a major battle for tyrion cercei jaime theres the emotional triangle between the three which only really works as a major point if the season starts with it jaime just coming into the city just as tyrion is put in prison based on cerceis accusations jaimes conflicting loyalties leading to his helping his brother rather than staying loyal to his sister the interactions of all 3 with oberyn the trial the murder of tywin the escape if jaime could spend most of season 2 in a cell so can tyrion and in fact tyrion has a lot more chance for interactions with other characters than jaime did in season 4 plenty there for all characters and not even getting into cerceis chapters from book 4 arya who i believe will end season 3 with being captured by the hound at the end of season 3 can have her travels with the hound expanded on in season 4 and her story ending with her leaving westeros to be trained as a fm plenty there and for dany  actually my theory is that mereen and astapor will not in fact be merged and that in fact meereen its siege and capture will be expanded on and cover the entirety of season 4 i believe n season 3 meereen will be build up as the capital of slaver bay strong and impenetrable and dany will be convinced not to attack it but at the final episode as she is marching with her army she sees the first of the children crucified with its hand pointing to meereen and the season will end with her turning her horse around and riding with her army away as a crucified child points to her the way where season 3 was dany builds her army season 4 will be dany the conqueror and only season 5 will be dany the leasder and season 4 will end with her at the top of the great pyramid of meereen while exiling jorah a lot there as well including a major battle agreegif classbbcemoticon altagree  bowdowngif classbbcemoticon altbowdown although i think one of the cliffhangers this season will be sansa just disappearing from

124 pages after the rw in my copy the rw ends at page 703 why cover 703 pages in 9 episodes at a rate of 78 pages per episode and then cover 124 pages in the final episode thats terrible pacing  its called character arc  thats no defense at all why not put rw episode 8 and spread pages more evenly character arc would be even betteroberyn and mace tyrell are not in season 3  they dont need to be see the reeds  oberyn is an important suspect for the poisoning of joffrey and his arc is very important in season 4aiden gillen says he gets a boat next season  no one is saying the aftermath happens this season were saying joffrey hits the floor this season lf doesnt need to take sansa anywhere until after the pw which would mean next season  the quote eliminates some ways in which the pw can unfold although not all of thempeter dinklage says this season breathes more deeplly  haaaa are you saying that means it cant happen because joffrey cant breathe  lol no i meant that he gave no hint that anything particularly drastic or exciting would happen this season unlike robb in interview who sounded pumped subjective but perhaps a useful clue in contextpw is a major event with loads of extras but yet no one near the sets mentions it happening whereas the rw was easily leaked  youre saying their production company cant keep a secret see lost and tons of other shows  but book readers already know what to expect in advance and so are looking out much more carefully for hints of the pw didnt watch lostwhy split asos in two only to have two major events back to back with little left for season 4  because theres lots more that happens in asos as well as the two other books whose events happen simultaneously theres more than enough left for season 4  but the natural arc of tywin dying to conclude season 4 would have to be pushed earlier and season 4 would likely end in affcadwd with plots unresolved why would hbo rush through the story when theyre onto a winnerwhy rush ahead to affc and adwd material when it is generally seen as weaker and difficult to work on tv  seen by whom you do you write for the show do you write for television or film for a living  ive read affcadwd combined it will be very difficult to adapt because of the vast number of viewpoints asos is a lot easier and more dramatic and has a much higher density of pivotal momentswhy have we not seen any clips of the pw in any trailer despite having seen the rw  because theyre not five year olds who cant keep a secret  its not easy to keep secrets about something this big its possible  but not easywhy put tyrions marriage in episode 8 making it a big thing unless if youre using it as a substitute for a major plot arc  youre assuming its in 8 but it could be in 7 either way it doesnt matter theyre two different events that happen very quickly in the books joffreys wedding is a bigger plot arc than tyrions which is much more of a lastminute personal arc than a multicharacter arc that has been planned since last season  we were told it is in episode 8 unless they moved it last minute itll be there theyre making a big song and dance about tyrions marriage whereas that never happened in the books so i think its a substitute pw isnt really a multicharacter arc as the significant role the tyrells play is best presented as a mystery imowhy is the pacing in kl not more urgent than it is given the need to fit such a major event in with the necessary foreshadowing and discussion  weve only had two epeisodes dragging it out to ep 10 is a long time why should there be any more foreshadowing and discussion when the moment joffrey choking is going to be a surprise as for foreshadowing and discussion did you miss the scene with lady olenna this week how much more do you want the wedding itself has been discussed every episode so far  fair point on foreshadowing however i think the pacing was the key point here i dont see why they would waste so much time focusing on tyrions marriage if the pw were inwhy not resolve uncat now providing a nice conclusion to cat and berics stories instead of leaving them for next season and replacing it with the pw  no one is discussing that here and it has no bearing on the pw at all of course most people would like to see it happen at the end of this season but one has nothing to do with the other they are relevant because they affect the business of the final episode if cat gets resurrected its definitely a seasonending worthy moment but if pw happens that should end the season if both are in they will need to cram the reaction in kings landing to the red wedding the reaction of stannis to robbs death the conclusion of jons arc at the wall the conclusion of aryas arc with the hound the taking of yunkai with dany being proclaimed mhysa the conclusion of brans arc  probably meeting samwell in well the well and the whole purple wedding itself into a single episode thats madnessgotta goedit ok finished but

"MoAt",2013-04-10,"anyway why do you want the pw in season 3like i and many have said repeatedly in this thread  its joffreys arc and the momentum of the season which would be lost moving to the first half of s4 but lotun says besttoo many issues with having the pw in season 4 lets say episode 3 jaime has nothing to do from around episode 7 seaon 3 to episode 3 of season 4 in the pw the stories of all the tyrells and lannisters in kl in season 3 have no climax the stories of all the tyrells and lannisters in kl in season 3 have no forward momentum as they enter season 4 they have not moved forward they are still carrying out marriage preparations they are still in effectively the same position as they were at the end of season 3 the story of tyrion and sansa climax too soon during season 3 if we treat their wedding as the climax of their season 3 storyline then it is an unsatisfactory climax as it becomes void when the pw comes in the middle of season 4 the stories of all tyrells and lannisters including tyrion and sansa as a stark have a weird plot movement in season 4 they start with no forward momentum and at the same place as at the end of season 3 when season 4 starts they have a very early climax by say episode 3 they have a very rapid change of scenery in terms of their position in the plot in the middle of the season and another climax and another rapid change at the end of the season minor plot turns introduced in season 3 are unresolved ie littlefinger tells sansa he wants to take her away margaery joeffrey and cercei prepare for a wedding the queen of thorns and margaery hint that they have a plot to deal with joffrey jaime is on a journey to kl but hasnt yet arrived there as he can only do so after the pw in tv you have large show wide arcs that take place throughout the seasons and you have smaller seasonwide arcs that spun an entire season examples of season wide arcs in previous seasons jon snow travels with qhorin halfhand until he is forced to kill him to infiltrate the wildlings daenerys travels to qarth and has her dragons stolen there tyrion is captured by catelyn stark and has to figure out how to escape and travel all the way back to kings landing jaime is imprisoned by robb and has to find a way to start his escape theon plots to capture winterfell and eventually fails arya stark is imprisoned in harrengall and has to arrange her escape all the season wide arcs listed here have proper and neat beginnings buildups climaxes and ends that span an entire season you cant start a minor arc at the start of a season leave it hanging midway by the end of the season tell the audience to wait and remember everything that happened for a year and then end that arc a third of the way into the next season thats bad storytelling and it leaves the audience unfulfilled the show cant introduce joffs wedding sansas escape attempt margs and the qots plots and then tells the audience well weve been hinting at all these things for a season but well just leave them hanging try and remember what happened for a year and check back next season where well close these arcs quickly in the first three episodes of the new season and introduce you to new story arcs instead if the pw closes all these story arcs it creates new story arcs that start neatly at the start of season 4 tyrion is imprisoned and must face a trial and plan his escape jaime arrives in kings landing and must decide between his sister and his brother oberyn arrives in kings landing to renew dornes fealty to the crown and must plot his revenge against the mountain and tywin cercei and margaery must fight for tommens affections sansa arrives in the vale and must handle her aunt and littlefinger the pw loses its impact if its not paired with the rw pairing the two together at the same time or very near to each other creates a theme and allows the viewer to contrast the two separating them by a year and having them some 5 episodes apart will actually make the tvonly viewer feel that the show is getting unimaginative the tvonly viewer will start thinking a death at a wedding again cant the show think of something new weve seen the same thing last year are we expected to be surprised againthere are more than enough big events to fit into season 4 two big battles meereen and the wall one cool new character with a fully fleshed out story arc oberyn a big trial by combat scene the meeting of two of the major characters in the series jon and stannis a very emotional murder scene tyrion and shaetywin a road adventure with arya and the hound possibly the conclusion of brans storyline assuming they push it forward from dwd thats more than enough material for a seasoni agree with thisif youre robb stark ill be rickard karstark tonguepng classbbcemoticon altp i was quoting robb im not robb im tyene sand or janna tyrelli would just like to say that i feel it is ridiculous to use book chronology as a reference for tv chronology for example the tvreeds who are major characters showed up much later than they did in the books so to say that there was x amount of time between two events in the book and use that as a valid reason for why they wont happen in the series is illogical the show deviates quite a bit from the booksalso i rather feel that since mace tyrell is not the schemer in the tyrell family in both book and show he will not be given as much precedence as people think especially since its already been estabilished that qot is the gameplayer in the show thus his official appearance is unnecessary at this pointjust for fun i would love if they had both weddings in one episode they show how everything is going well in both weddings then suddenly the tullyfrey wedding gets bloody which is then contrasted with the celebration shots of joff and marg then after you see cats bloody last moments you see the celebration at kl and suddenly as all the nonbook readers are screaming at their televisions about how unfair and cruel the world is they see joff clawing at his neck boom end of episode this is what i want but even if pw is in this season i doubt that theyll do it my way dwhile

"RememberTheNorth",2013-04-11,"im fairly interested in this theory care to share how you think this may go down it would be an interesting twista lot of people ive talked to have read the books and watch the show generally agree that the two shaes are very different tv shae is much kinder and more sympathetic that book one in fact if im not mistaken book shae was generally not so much in the forefront and remained behind the scenes for much of the time however the hbo adaptation has included a lot of extra material such as shae being sansas handmaiden a deviation from the booksi may be wrong on that point dont quote me on ithavent read sos in a while however the fact that shae cares so very much about sansa is interesting in a lot of ways book shae would have never shown such devotion and while grrm likes to throw everything we hold for granted out the window i dont think they would destroy the character arc that this character has been built up to by betraying tyrion the dock scene in the premiere was interesting as well clearly ros and shae hold some sort of unseen rivalry that has not been fully realized yet why does shae press tyrion so when asking how many times he had sex with her why does she care so much if it was in the past and he says hes over her another pointif shae is so caring for sansa that she would threaten to kill another maid before she told cersei that sansa had gotten her period this gives shae many honorable qualities in my eyes although this could mean nothing at all the reason as to why ros is in the adaption is a question no one can really answer yet at first several people i know who watched got called her the miscellaneous whore filing the places of many book whores the season finale scene with varys is unexplainable in a lot of ways as welldoes he really want to simply know more about littlefinger or is there an underlying motive there ros to me is appearing more sketchy by the minute and is almost emulating varys mysterious behavior to some degree we do not know her true motives just as we dont know varys or littlefingers to be honest i do not know yet how her part in tyrions downfall will unfold because there is nothing in the books to reference besides the placement of book shae i just have this feeling that its going to happen somehow varys as we may know is in all likelihood a targaryen loyalist who would see anything to help danys return to the throne perhaps he has a part to play in tyrion becoming a pariah in kl and moving on to meet up with dany i dont know but what i do know is that ros has much looser standards than other characters in the story she is a whore after all although not with a heart of gold as shae has however this creates another problem what about the bed scene with tywin i do find it unlikely he would out of the blue sleep with ros and thats how tyrion kills her this is messy and makes no sense at all to the viewers i also found it painfully unrealistic in the books although dramatic nonetheless what would be entertaining is to have ros payed by cersei or whoever to lie at the trial actually she wouldnt even have to lie she has slept with tyrion on more than one occasion thus pushing forth the conviction of tyrion thus causing shae to murder ros out of complete revenge and hatred for what she did simply because tyrion kills his father in a bedchamber does not mean that ros has to be there as well i know this theory is totally insane but this is the only way i can rationalize in my mind ros place in the story besides i have heard even more farfetched rumors such as lf for no reason murdering ros that totally discredits my theory no one really knows what will happen though its too far off to say edited by rememberthenorth 11 april 2013  1239 pm"

"Sasha Steelsong",2013-04-11,"pehaps we get both weddings this season i doubt it though it would be interesting tematically with pw being the last episode and tyrions arrest a cliffhanger then the next season is centered around tyrions trial etcwell actually it will be three weddings if we get them all this season not just two since well also be getting tyrionsansa  this episode in particular seemed to be foreshaddowing that a lot i really do hope we get all three weddings especially if we get the leaches scene it will be nice to see all the kings die in the same season and that s4 focuses on tyrions trialescape and all that fun with that said im not holding my breath that well get to the pw as much as i think ending the season on tryions arrest will be a good thing i wont be surprised if they save that for the second or even third though that would be pushing it episode in season 4"
"Sasha Steelsong",2013-04-11,"im not saying the pw this season is impossible im just saying it would be extremely illogical in fact the entire reason that the martells are showing up in the first place was an act of goodwill by tywin if i remember correctly hoping to mend relations after the mountain raped that one girl that oberyn will eventually kill him over in the combat scene sorryi dont remember her name right now its been a long time since i read the books anyway it should be realized that they are not just strolling into kings landing for no reason getting to the wedding is the only reason theyd show up thereforei think it will be next season not saying thats set in stone but its just my personal opinion and what i would do if i were a writerno it isnt getting to the wedding is actually an afterthought they show up because oberyn is going to take the seat on the small council that was part of the whole myrcella deal with dorne so it would be very easy to have the martells show up next season and have oberyn go find tyrion in a cell out of curiosity mirroring what they did as kids when he went to casterly rock to get them to bond"

"The Mountain That Posts",2013-04-11,"ive talked to many people on many forums who purposefully chose not to read the books but instead watch the show and that alone this is hilarious to me because a lot of it is like wah i dont have time to read books but you have time to watch over 20 hours of a television show most likely twice since everyone has watched game of thrones through at least twice wah i dont want the books to ruin the show for me thatd be like not listening to an original song because you like the cover version by a different band wut i dont like fantasy  i have better things to be reading  yadada but you like the show if anything the show is much more unrealistic and obviously set in a fantasy than most of the books this is just my opinion though ive also met plenty of people who hated the show because of the stupidest reasons too many characters i hate nudity too much talking terrible pacing and too much emphasis on cliffhangers and plot twists etc these reasons are all valid i suppose to not liking the show shrug the fact of the matter is im sure more people have watched the first season of game of throneswhether on dvdbluray on tv or on the internet than the collective total of sales between all five books i cant back this up or anything but it really wouldnt surprise me so does it stand on its own as a really popular show yes does it stand out on its own and make total sense to near everyone who didnt read the books no i dont think so ive found that most nonbook readers tend to ask me or the internet a lot of questions that arent made clear in the show hell i showed someone the entire first episode and he didnt even realize that cersei and jaime were siblings at the end  nor why it was a big enough dealcesting up the queen to warrant pushing a kid out a window or the possible implications that the queens children are all bastards of course this is just one silly example that comes to my mind but ive heard horror stories most recently people thinking robbboltonkarstark were at the ruins of winterfell and that the boat scenes dany was on obviously meant she had landed in westeros wtf of course even people who arent morons get confused sometimes my mother kept forgetting that lysa arryn was cats sisterand thus being confused why cat brought tyrion to the eyrie ive had to explain to a roommate that rhaegar was never a king but the mad kings first prince who died etc i think as a whole we wont really know if the show stands on its own until its absolutely finished that way we can measure all the plot progression foreshadowing character development etc without any book biasokay less book bias and that way we can also look at every question reference or statement made and see if it makes sense or not in a totally showonlynofriendsorbooksorinternethelping way"

which he does and bran does too which is what im guessing theyre going to call greendreams for the show jojen doesnt claim to be a greenseer or a warg he calls the three eyed crow something deeperi believe the show will probably explain it more as jojen tries to teach bran how to control summer while hes awaketheres a long way before they get to where theyre headedi wonder why robb didnt receive word that bran and rickon were dead  maybe the boltons just didnt find out about the fake deathstheon ordered the bodies taken down since their heads werent on spikes the siege army had no idea they were killed i suppose theyre going to have to get the truth or fake truth out of theon now what they tell robb is going to be interesting because obviously hes not getting the truth about winterfell at this pointshe wasnt a pussy she tried to fight a grown manthoros was a melee champion even book arya would have gotten splatted if that fight happened its consistent with the logic of the booksand the sword she carries is not a braavo blade like she was practicing to use in the books she comments to the lady on acorn hill about how she lost her needle and her new one isnt as goodif you look at what i said my point was that she should have been able to do something other than have the sword knocked out of her hand immediately i also was referring to the general toning down of her character over the past two seasons but this episode really took it to another levelwhere are you coming up with this idea from from your imagination arya never fights anyone in the books in a situation like that she starts to try to pick a fight with gendry before the gold cloaks interrupted would she have poked holes in him or would gendry just simply knock needle out of her hand theres no way to knowi dont think its unreasonable to think thoros could do what he did thinking arya was suppose to do more than she did is completely wrong shes not even holding the sword correctly she should be using two hands but syrio never taught her to use a longswordeta i also found it completely against character that she told gendry and hot pie about jaqen getting them out of harrenhal that really bothered me because arya would have known about the need for secrecy she doesnt just go blab everything that happensthe books and the show they both know that she saved jaqen biter and rorge from the fire in the show before they walked out the gate last season arya clearly explains to hot pie and gendry that jaqen is helping them escape or else why would they have came in the first place it seems more differentiated from the books for her to explain her deal that jaqen gave her with the three deaths but it was hilariously funny dialogue straight out of a message board on the internetyou couldve named anyone joffrey tywin lannisterhe helped us escape i dont see why youre complainingbut you couldve ended the waralso did you notice that arya has revealed that her grandfather is lord of riverrun to hot pie this is definitely not something she did in the booksya this kinda troubled me toj kept popping up several times in got and wasnt mentioned at all in the s1it popped up in eddards mind a couple times he never spoke a word about it to anyonewhen jojen said howland cried and stuff i was like theyre finally gonna talk about it then nothing now its breaking my heart because i believe in

"shiola",2013-04-09,"but the point is he should be just like the whole harrenhal plot has been twisted and morphed into something completely unrecognizableand vis i watch the show because i love the books and i want to see my characters onscreen i cant help that the writers are purposely effing up on a weekly basis i mean they do know that they just can make up sht and call it an episode and no one will complain rightthe theon plot this season is beyond dumbi mean its completely laughable but hey we get a few powerful scenes here and there maegary and joffrey plus sansa  the queen of thorns so ill continue to tune in1 why should he be because he was right away in the books maybe theyre going to use him instead of willas for the marriage proposal and as a result he will be made a kingsgaurd to prevent that 2 they are not your characters the fact that you said that makes me think i shouldnt even try to have a discussion with you so maybe this is in vain they are martins characters and he gave dd the right to use them for an adaptation an adaptation not a clone its not the same thing it was never meant to be the same thing it could never be the same thing because books and visual media are completely different 3 they can make up whatever they want because its their interpretation of the story4 from the 5 minutes of theons arc you have concluded its beyond dumb you realize it is so far the same as what he went through in the books 5 margaery and joffreys scene was not in the book yet you like it i fail to see your logic hereand i didnt ask why you watch it i asked why you came in the thread specifically to say that its crap and the writers are purposely effing up  and all of that i just dont understand why you would come in here just to say you hate something seems silly edited by vis 09 april 2013  0602 pm"

"Envie",2013-04-09,"yeah those scenes in particular have been more of a writers extrapolation rather than invention the margaery they have presented in the series so far is a bit different from how shes portrayed in the books but how shes portrayed in the books is presented largely through the lens of highly subjective pov characters sansa thinks very highly of her and sees her as a true friend though she does note that she seemed more alert and worldly than her handmaidens tyrion the only other major pov in kings landing in book 3 doesnt think much of her at all her charity and popularity with the commoners certainly comes through but any prewedding interaction she had with joffrey was not revealed what david  dan have come up with is not far off from what a lot of fan consensus regarding what her true nature must be a highly intelligent player and very much her grandmothers protege whose primary talent is acting this is made more clear in the books in book 4 where she plays cersei as thoroughly and easily as the show has her playing joffrey hereas far as renlys character it hasnt been changed at all with this scene with regard to the backdoor incident margaery was lying with renly she was frank and overtly not concerned with decorum in private to the point where she was to renlys shock suggesting that they have a threesome involving her brother if thats what it took to get him started its highly unlikely that she would have turned down an offer for any form of intercourse with renly but with joffrey the speed and ease with which she throws renly under the bus is remarkable she invents a scene that plays up both her innocence and renlys perversion knowing full well that it will play to joffreys inclinations and worm her way into his good graces which of course is her intent from the starti really appreciated your views on this and wanted to thank you for such a great explanation since we have no pov chapters for margaery or joffrey in the books its somewhat easy to argue their motivations and personalities for the series i think the creators have done a spectacular job of bringing both characters to life as well as the fine acting skills of the actors portraying them i appreciate these characters a lot more in the hbo series because im now seeing them from a different perspective that better displays some terrific motivation exposition for the tyrells and lannisters bothalso i agree with you completely about the sex  renly scene i could tell immediately she was playing every card possible to win joffreys favor even lying about renly straight up while still alluding to just enough of the truth to show her innocence this was masterfully well played and joffrey ate it up all of it including the degenerate remarks margaerys willingness to back his sadistic pleasures as well as any laws he would pass to kill said degenerates even if it includes her own brother was fairly obvious even to nonbook readers as just manipulative talk once margaery learned joffreys true nature thanks to confessions from sansa it was simple for her with grandmas coaching to use that exact thing as a tool and joffrey is a very easily used tool"
"Envie",2013-04-09,"also in reading the pages of analysis about joffreys particular sadistic tendencies i think the impact of the end scene where hes holding the crossbow with margaery was very powerful and ominous as intended but may have distracted some viewers from the way the scene opened do not forget that when margaery first walked into the room she was nervous and joffrey quickly pinned her to the corner by asking outright what her loyalty  respect was for a dead man renly who was a traitor he boldly asked if it had been no place for a woman at the bedside of a known traitor and then point blank asks why she failed to get pregnant by renly remember that i think this was possibly joffreys carefully veiled threat of knowledge of renlys and therefore loras too true inclinations the look on gleasons face at that moment was really scary and well acted margaery falters for the briefest moment before going onward to parry the remark and recover by admitting renlys particular perversions did not make him a suitable bed partner for making children together and she then gave a perfect confession which won joffrey over to her side he was clearly testing her show joffrey is older and much more cunning than book joffrey i love him"

"Envie",2013-04-10,"thank you mladen and i agree  the scene could very well have played out similarly in the books if wed had a pov from either characters margaery doesnt seem that scheming in in the book only because we only hear of her from other characters perspectives and they have no idea its not obvious until we hear through sansa that the tyrells are very crafty and clever at all well the women are anyways the writers of the series took this and ran with it flawlesslyenvie you really gave a new perspective on the scene and i have to say it i like it this scene serves many purposes first as i have already pointed out is foreshadowing of pw but we have so much more to discuss here we were already told by jaime that renlys proclivity was worst kept secret at the court so logically joffrey would know about renlyloras affair margaery here isnt just being tested about renly she is tested where he loyalties lie between her brother and her king and she wisely gone under joffreys skin and told him that he can do whatever he needs to do  snipyes exactly i think too many people missed the point that joffrey very much already knew about renly and loras hes lived at court all his life and he heard the usual gossip everyone else did why else would he already have plans to make it punishable by death if he hadnt already heard to me that scene is very much about joffrey testing margaerys loyalty and margaery passing with flying colors even though shes lying  so much so that by the end scene where hes holding her and the crossbow we get to see just how deviant his sexual nature is  hes only turned on by sadistic controlled violence margaery knew this because of sansas confessions and knew how to play him olenna and margaery already know at this point that it does not matter whether or not joffrey is a monster or not because theyre already making plans to eliminate him regardless so margaerys support lie of joffreys desire to kill all degenerates even if it includes her brother doesnt matter  she doesnt think hes really in any danger since they dont intend for joffrey to remain king by saying pity and eyerolling at the end of the luncheon with sansa viewers are clued in to the fact they dont really care if joffreys a bad king or a good king they would prefer a kind hearted person easier to manipulate like the male tyrells are apparently but since hes not they have to go another route to overcome the political obstacle"
"aedalia",2013-04-10,"i hadnt thought about the foreshadowing thank you i just thought it was clever and was a good way to show how cruel joff is since in the show they reallyjust had to hit the high points as it were with his depravity it was also a good way to show how smart margaery is it was like a little test to see if they could work with him"
"Frey Pie a la Mode",2013-04-10,"upon further reflection i wonder why so much effort was put into margaery winning joffrey over the wedding is set and as the qots pity comment shows its already a done deal that it will be purple his fate is sealed so why work so hard to manipulate him and make him so besotted if he was going to remain the king and her husband that would make more sense i suppose it would help ensure that he doesnt try and do anything really nasty to marg before the wedding which might have been the case if he thought she was another potential victim like sansa"
"Envie",2013-04-10,"that is probably exactly the intentions we may be reading too much into it  maybe it was just a simple scene to show she was capable of being more politcally savvy than sansa who was innocent and victimized i think the scene was far more complex then that and thats why i keep writing a lot about it the forshadowing and predictions revealed are far better hints than we ever got in the books"
"Mladen",2013-04-10,"to me that scene is very much about joffrey testing margaerys loyalty and margaery passing with flying colors even though shes lying  so much so that by the end scene where hes holding her and the crossbow we get to see just how deviant his sexual nature is  hes only turned on by sadistic controlled violence margaery knew this because of sansas confessions and knew how to play him olenna and margaery already know at this point that it does not matter whether or not joffrey is a monster or not because theyre already making plans to eliminate him regardless so margaerys support lie of joffreys desire to kill all degenerates even if it includes her brother doesnt matter  she doesnt think hes really in any danger since they dont intend for joffrey to remain kingwhen you mix up a bit books and tv show you get a great picture of tyrells they already knew the truth about joffrey but not in extent sansa could tell the thats why they needed sansa to interogate her and find out whether what lf told them is actually true so when they get their confirmation they proceed and after they realized its true they turned to the only solution they had  kill joffrey and use tommenby saying pity and eyerolling at the end of the luncheon with sansa viewers are clued in to the fact they dont really care if joffreys a bad king or a good king they would prefer a kind hearted person easier to manipulate like the male tyrells are apparently but since hes not they have to go another route to overcome the political obstaclei wouldnt be so certain male tyrells are more naive than female loras played his game quite a lot of time and garlan was suspiciously close to joffreys cup even closer than olenna and god knows what happened between willas and oberynupon further reflection i wonder why so much effort was put into margaery winning joffrey over the wedding is set and as the qots pity comment shows its already a done deal that it will be purple his fate is sealed so why work so hard to manipulate him and make him so besotted if he was going to remain the king and her husband that would make more sensebecause this wasnt about margaery this was about lorass safety to keep him away of joffrey margaery manipulated him to do what he wants and secured herself but now they had to protect loras for if joffrey starts killing degenerates loras will be at the top of the list so they are dancing to joffreys tune while they arrange sansaloras marriage edited by mladen 10 april 2013  0255 pm"
"Envie",2013-04-10,"i wouldnt be so certain male tyrells are more naive than female loras played his game quite a lot of time and garlan was suspiciously close to joffreys cup even closer than olenna and god knows what happened between willas and oberynits true loras is quite good at the game and managed to remain popular because of his jousting skills and has oodles more personality than his elder male tyrell counterparts perhaps the image of the older men being big oafs was just part of the rose illusion too its hard to tell with so few details about them given in the books we have lady olennas outspoken opinions and not much elsewhats key important to me is that were given some insight in these scenes that we did not get in the books while yes certain details and characters have been changed a lot most of the major plots have remained true to writing subplots around them support alternative views again since we didnt have pov thoughts from many of the book characters if lady olenna reveals that she thinks her late husband and son are idiots then thats the opinion viewers are getting leaving everyone to suspect her involvement because she herself admits shes far more interesting then the rest of them and margaery has already clearly displayed complete willingness to do whatever it takes to become queen from season 3 with renly doing whatever it takes even risking her own brothers life to appease an insanely dangerous boy king like joffrey is definitely clear indication that assassination is not off the table for them at all"
"Mladen",2013-04-10,"sizeits true loras is quite good at the game and managed to remain popular because of his jousting skills and has oodles more personality than his elder male tyrell counterparts perhaps the image of the older men being big oafs was just part of the rose illusion too its hard to tell with so few details about them given in the books we have lady olennas outspoken opinions and not much elsewhats key important to me is that were given some insight in these scenes that we did not get in the books while yes certain details and characters have been changed a lot most of the major plots have remained true to writing subplots around them support alternative views again since we didnt have pov thoughts from many of the book characters if lady olenna reveals that she thinks her late husband and son are idiots then thats the opinion viewers are getting leaving everyone to suspect her involvement because she herself admits shes far more interesting then the rest of them and margaery has already clearly displayed complete willingness to do whatever it takes to become queen from season 3 with renly doing whatever it takes even risking her own brothers life to appease an insanely dangerous boy king like joffrey is definitely clear indication that assassination is not off the table for them at alltyrells are like rose i think grrm had carefully chosen their sigil and words and he uses that as their philosophy they are epiphany of beauty and manners they can enchant anyone and they are certainly quite capable in making people love them but for all that beauty rose hides the thorns and if you squeeze it hard you will feel thorns piercing your hand they are unite as starks rich as lannisters dangerous as martells thats why they are growing strong from conquest all the way till nowunlike last season when there were some questionable changes i like this years changes especially concerning tyrells it is a fresh air of danger and political smartness that tops everyone else also we have deepening characters and creating more drama which is for tv much neededand as you said in the last line they are not above assasination and this scene wonderfully portrays it they will play around do necessery courtship but above all they will do what must be done to ensure their growth for exchanging joffrey with tommen is ensuring that they prosper and beside winter and the fact almost every major house is failing tyrells are growing stronger and are in misummers eve"

"Gonzalo",2013-04-08,"so this episode we had our first peek at locke a tv character who is supposed to be playing the role of vargo hoathowever if you think about it this isnt quite rightvargo hoat and co were a mercenary band who switched sides and had no loyalty to anyone they were also criminal and depravedlocke is boltons own bannerman why would he cut off jamies handroose cant do it he needs the alliance with tywin atleast book roose wouldnt do such a thingi cant see robb not finding out about roose sending jamie free  hand cut off or otherwise i am really curious to see how this will all work out do you think they will manage to find plausible explanations and motivations for all sides or as i think  and i really hope i am wrong  they will make an epic screw up like jamie killing alton last season in a scene that made no sense whatsoeverdont forget that lord rickard had promised the hand of his daughter to whoever captured the kingthlayer"
"Big Daddy Dave",2013-04-08,"seems simple enough to me have jaime try to escape and locke cuts his hand off either in a fight or to teach him a lesson roose bolton comes along later and tries to play it up like locke was going too far he may even kill locke in front of jaime to try to make amends with jaimetywin and then lets him go roose wont have to worry about what robb thinks about the whole affair for much longer anyway the timing will be close enough for him edited by big daddy dave 08 april 2013  0103 pm"

"Khal-a-bunga",2013-04-08,"another thing i should mention is that locke already exists in the books hes called steelshanks waltonits not about being a kinslayer its the way they went about it the whole scenewhy is a noblemans son on guard duty by himselfwhy does that moron enter the cage when he saw one prisoner kill anotherdoes jamie really expect to escape when surrounded by thousands of northern soldiersand yes i did find it out of character for jamie to kill not only one of his kin but someone who hero worshipped him a minute ago for basically no reason he could just have told alton to pretend dead instead perhaps the son of a noble man was on guard duty because the prisoner is the kingslayer just a thought i believe lord karstark mentions that another of his sons was killed in a battle against the lannister forces so perhaps the moron enters the cage after seeing what jaime has done because he wants to give out a beating to this captive who he clearly underestimates  i think its pretty clear that survive or not jaime is done being a complacent captive through dialogue he has mentioned several times in the show that he would prefer death to being shamed crippled so his entire escape attempt felt vaguely suicidal though im sure jaime would prefer to escape with his life as any same person likely would  i think this played into the mind set of either escaping or being killed a kingslayer and a kinslayer  how could they possibly allow him to live after what hed done which is exactly why catelyn lets him go seeing as littlefinger came to her with the deal tyrion proposed jaime for sansa  arya though as we know arya isnt really a part of the deal and she had every right to believe that jaime wouldnt last another night in the camp without robb there all of this taken from the show itself all of it requiring little more than a bit of empathy and common sense i dont see how and why some changes are so confusing to people its as if they arent capable of reconciling with they already know from the books with how things can occur on the show and of the two dont match up then it often makes no sense at all not specifically referring to you op whom i quoted above just speaking more generally"

"Bolton's Bastard",2013-04-10,"exactly if lord tywin can have loose cannons such as gregor clegane smashing elia and her children why cant roose bolton have exactly the same problem dont forget that book roose knows nothing about hoat chopping off jaimes hand until hoat brings jaime and brienne back to harrenhal and their journey lasts nearly a week hoat in turn doesnt know of the roosetywin plot so he has no idea that returning a maimed kinglsayer is going to cause problems when he finds out what has been done roose worries about tywins reaction because in the meantime he has jumped ship so we get that delicate dinner table conversation where jaime assures roose that if he is returned safely to kl he will tell his father whatever story roose wants i cant see why that basic scenario shouldnt play out just as well with a loose cannon locke instead of hoat simplifying the story this way is probably one of the easiest and most sensible alterations from book to screeni thought hoat had jaimes hand sliced off to create tension between tywin and roose because he suspected that roose was planning to defect"

"Dove",2013-04-13,"hopefully they keep jaime being forced to wear his rotting hand around his neck its unpleasant as hell and intensely jacked up and really showed the brave companions warped sense of humor along with their reenactment of the bear and maiden fair later jaime jumping into the pit with brienne even though he knew he didnt have a chance in hell without his hand was a fantastic moment im pretty sure theyll keep it in changing locke to a bolton man is a little odd considering how events go down but if they show roose having a negative reaction to his treatment of jaime and punishing him itll probably be understandable that roose still gets a pardon"
"I'll pay the iron price",2013-04-13,"i like the suggestion of karstark hacking jaimes hand off which gives robb reason to behead him trouble is karstark is going to riverrun with robb and roose is hanging back at harrenhal i cant see locke going to karstark instead of his master bolton"

"MisunderstoodFrey",2013-04-13,"later jamie could use the fact that a bolton bannerman cut his hand off as direct bargaining leverage to trigger rooses decision to1 release him and2 switch sides in an attempt to save themselves from tywins wrathi dont think so i think roose will offer locke to the lannisters the mountain and have the same brutal demise that his source character had i think this would work better firstly because roose is the definition of a cold and calculating character so i cant imagine him fearing tywin in the same way everyone does and secondly because it shows that roose is ready to sacrifice just about anyone if it works to his own advantage an idea which would make another later action of his make more sense to show watchers"
"The Fourth Head",2013-04-14,"thats a good extra detail misunderstoodfrey roose sells locke out to the lannisters to do as they see fit though im not sure when they would do this considering jamie has to be released then go back to save brienne from the bear if locke has been sold out already who is tormenting brienne with the bear i take your point that roose wouldnt fear tywin he says so in the books but selling locke may not be enough to ensure tywin recognises the boltons as the wardens of the north after rebelling against him and cutting off his sons hand without doing something more to ensure future recognition having jaimie plant the seed of betrayal by asking who will rule in the north once the starks are defeated and then implying tywin wouldnt recognise the boltons after what they did to his hand"
"therustman",2013-04-14,"i think locke may survive  primarily it gives bolton a recognised second when he gets to winterfell"

"LordStoneheart",2013-04-08,"when i saw he was sweeping and promised to help theon i instantly thought it was one of the games ramsay plays i think its just the writers way of putting the kyra story line in without having to cast her only to have her not be part of the show after very little time hes going to set theon free and then hunt him and i do think with all the secrecy its a bit obvious now edited by lordstoneheart 08 april 2013  0910 am"

"Jamie Lannister",2013-04-08,"im pretty sure hes going to be revealed as ramsay later in the season  i know a lot of ppl picture ramsay older but wouldnt he be around the same age as theonrobbjonetc also iwan rheon is pretty famous and has been super secretive about his role in game of thrones  and has even kiiinnnda let things slip w twitter actions lol im 100 sure that its ramsayramsays pretty young in the books too early to mid twenties most likely hes described as a young man by bran in his first appearance edited by jamie lannister 08 april 2013  0912 am"
"velki",2013-04-08,"i like the storyline so far personally obviously boy is who we all think but i like the idea of him as a figure who continually provides theon with hope a man without hope can hardly be broken further  hes already given up before long a man with hope can horrifically suffer unendingly sounds right up ramsays alley especially the idea of him spitting on that hope in the end edit  plus he has a perfect position for himself to watch all of theons torture maybe not as handson as bookramsay would like but still amazingly awful and voyeuristic once his true nature is revealed edited by velki 08 april 2013  0916 am"
"freetickles",2013-04-08,"i like the positioning as a kid sweepingcleaning up instead of as a fellow prisoner as it allows the whole letting him escape angle if theon had his wits about him hed question why the torturers would let some stable boy who just showed up there hang out while theyre torturing a valuable prisoner but theon is obviously not in the mindset to think of that as to flaying theyve definitely played up the boltons affinity for flaying too much both through rooses comments last season and the mentions of the flayed man sigil to not have him get flayed probably after hes recaptured i dont think well see flaying onscreen but will probably get a gruesome view of his fingers once theyre flayed"
"Ferrum Aeternum",2013-04-08,"i thought i was weird how he left the door to the dungeon open the way he did seemed like he wasnt trying to conceal his actions at allmy interpretation was that was done purposely to drive home the symbolism of the xshaped cross which appears prominently in the bolton heraldry on the show perhaps to give casual viewers an idea of theons location without actually giving it away since the torturer doesnt answer theon when he asks where he isi too cant wait to see where this story is headed in the coming weeks the hunt sequence has a lot of potential to be horrifically awesome"

"BananaSpice",2013-04-11,"i actually think theyre playing up a redemption arc for theon quite well similar to jaimes yes he killed two innocent kids just like jaime threw bran out a window and killed his cousin the fact that he didnt kill bran and rickon resonates with a lot of people though and he clearly regretted his actions and felt pressured into them by his father his sister dagmer etc his scene with maester luwin begging him to take the black showed that he would have taken a way out if it were clean which he didnt think the nw would be viewers will increasingly feel sorry for him as ramsay tortures and breaks him so ramsay will indeed be seen as evilthat said as awesome as the reveal of boyasramsay will be its nothing compared to rooses betrayal of robb and i have a hard time seeing them fit it into the rw storylinei think whats bothering me is that show watchers have no reason to think that it wasnt the ironborn who killed everyone at winterfell  burned it down since those are the lies being fed to robbcat  and even though they know theon was betrayed i think they still blame him for that in their minds"

"Currawong",2013-04-10,"jaime was mostly playing with ned  you could see it in his face jaime enjoys a good fight and i dont think he would have enjoyed just killing ned so quickly as for the jb fight those swords are heavy and i agree with newstarthe fight was less blatantly sexual than in the books no jaime wounding brienne in her upper thigh no thrashing about in the mud with clothing askew but it was still great and there was subtext aplenty locke calling brienne your woman jaime saying that fighting gets the juices flowing  etc etc i didnt mind brienne giving jaime a drubbing as one review described it even if it was a departure from the books since the show seemed to make it clear that jaime was worn out very quickly gasping for breath on the ropes etc etc it made sense within the showi agree what i really loved about the whole scene was the start where they showed jaimes sheer joy at having a sword in his hand again and being able to fight which is going to be at the heart of what happens later it was also very good at portraying the way his condition quickly gave out and that he was fighting under the handicap of being manacled judging bythe reviews i dont think tv viewers missed those aspectsand yes bolivar  i know that medieval swords were only a few pounds in weight but medieval people were also a lot smaller if you look at the clothing and the armour even for wellfed nobility so if you scale things up to the size of the actors and the swords today then the slower moving action was far more appropriate i am so grateful that we didnt get a typical hollywood fancystyle swordfight straight from the swashbuckling days of errol flynn that to me would have looked completely unrealistic with brienne in armour and weakened jaime with manacled handssilverx2 i dont think bald jaime was ever a practical option because nikolaj was filming other things during and after shooting seasons 2 and 3 of got and then he and gwen had to come back earlier this year months after all the other s3 filming had finished to shoot the bearpit stuff in la with little bart making jaimencw bald would have created all sorts of continuity issues for both got and his other movies so the got writers sensibly dropped that aspect edited by currawong 10 april 2013  0125 am"

"Dove",2013-04-10,"yeah i thought the fight was fine it actually felt a lot more genuine than most swordfights on screen even in this show you have to figure that not only is brienne that good but jaime is shackled malnourished dehydrated and hes been a prisoner forever so hes out of shape too the most important part was how they captured how genuinely happy jaime was to have a sword back in his hand how in his element he is in the thick of battle even in overwhelming circumstances its gonna make it even sadder when he loses that selfassurance later"

"Darryk",2013-04-11,"yeah some really entertaining dialogue and great performances by the two just wish there had been one or two conversations showing jaimes love for his siblings and how alive he feels with a sword in his hand like there was in the book maybe theyll come later"

"jugdesh258",2013-04-11,"yeah a big point was made in the books about how despite being so weakened after his captivity and also chained at the hands jaime still gave brienne the fight of her life i was really gutted this didnt come across at all on the show it just made jaime seem like a fraud considering his comments about only 3 men in the kingdoms possibly being able to stand a chance against him in a fight  the tv fans will just think hes all talk nowwell if we take the leap that one of those 3 men might be loras tyrell then jaime was not aware that brienne bested loras when he was making that boast"

"Hodors Shlong",2013-04-08,"i think were going to get a considerable amount of gore with theon this season going forward i think they should be able to make him resemble the reek from the books because you can do a lot of that stuff without cgi tyrons nonose couldnt have been done without cgi so they did the scar with theon you can cut off as many fingers and toes as you want and just put gloves on him like with davos fake teeth would be a simple prosthetic to do i would think and an even simpler one would be scars on his face making him look like an old man as hes described in the books might be a little tougher but i think it would still be relatively cheap compared to cgi"
"Trident full of Dogs",2013-04-08,"well i liked the theon scenes so far i can however see how people who never read the book can think that hes only getting what he deserves specially since the show very likelly wont go to the point of torture they went on the books putting him right into wooby territory they must be really careful to make us root for theon again after what he did to the starkseven in the books i thought he deserved everything he got before he became basically broken losing winterfell being capture etc even if theon was executed id probably go like you looked for it pal but the torture obviously was too much for any human being if they dont get really bold real fast and show the whole mutilation thing it could look like the villain theon got what he deservedi am pretty sure they will show the mutilation and all the torture tv loves violence"

"BananaSpice",2013-04-09,"theon is constantly feeling guilty and questioning himself in acok hes also constantly trying to justify what hes doing and is convincing himself that hes being just  doing the right thing  this shows a major conscience and that he isnt an evil person at heart he has his own men whipped for raping a woman who is basically nothing to him  lowly for example his regret comes across in the show as well hes easily influenced by others which doesnt help he basically just keeps digging the hole deeper and deeper even if it werent for adwdreekramsay i would think he is sympathetic maybe thats just me though"
"Reposado",2013-04-09,"im going to be talking with my dad a lot during this season he came off last season with well good for this ramsay guy theon deserves to be tortured curious to see if he comes aroundi have more sympathy for theon in the show than in the book in the book he seemed more callous and less regretful this of course changed in adwdreeks chapters were my favorite in the whole book also i was a lot younger when i first read acok to quote dave chen from a cast of kings great show reviews showtheons almost shakespearean in the total tragedy and pathos surrounding his character i felt so sorry for him all throughout the season helped in part by alfies stellar actingso yeah im looking forward to seeing him this season poor baby itll be riveting to see him become such a broken wretchas far is flaying the us version of being human had a vampire get skinned this is what it looked like totally doable for hbogame of thrones doesnt have the budget for that"

"kevin1989",2013-04-09,"claps  i like the wanting to belong v vengeance argument i mean i dont want to make theon sound like he is a saint bc hes not but im shocked and appalled at how many people seem to really just hate him im like  were they watchingreading the same thing i wastrue im not finding him a saint but who is in the books only thing that i hate that many people judge him without even trying to understand why he did that its funny that 3 characters grrm named that are highly misunderstood by many are theon jaime and mellisandre to be fair i think in both book and show he was certainly involved in the murder of the two children in the book he was pressured by ramsay to do so theon would never have come up with that idea himself tbh in the show he did come up with the idea himself but he seems to feel guilty as evidenced by him trying to pay the farmermiller and then seeming a bit upset when he realizes that his men killed the farmermiller too in the book he has a lot of regret about killing the kids  he has a nightmare about it in facttrue but didnt ramsey not killing the boys himself and theon only gave a nod ore something like thatand about the show i had the feeling dagmer killed the boys in the showwell i guess letting himself be called king in the north could kinda be called treason to his king stannis noalso i have to say im surprised how rarely ned gets any flak people say he was always trying to do good to which i say no hes always trying to do the honorable thing but thats by far not always the same as the right thing eg letting a war with thousands of innocents killed because siding with renly or lf for the throne wouldnt be honorabletrue if he did that there wouldnt be a war and he did rebelled against the mad king even not telling robert about cerceis treason even got robert and himself killedyour right he killed 2 children and their mother i recallalright tell me im wrong tell me ramsayclef jaw talked him into it that he had no choice i love people defending children killers their excuses are always quite fun to heresimply put getting bad advice from someone is not an excuse for killing children almost nothing is reallyand you like robb you like robert you like ned"

"LordAlexOfTheWolds",2013-04-12,"httpwwwyoutubechvflmtbje2kgg  this is the video for a game of thrones new characters feature at 811 it shows thoros beric and melisandre melisandre looks shocked probably because she is looking at berics wounds and cant believe he is alive im almost certain this didnt happen in the book so there has to be a reason for such a major deviation also shell have travelled pretty fastis this so she can gain the knowledge to do something to a certain character at the end of dancestart of windsim not sure if this is the correct place to post it but seen as it is about the show i thought it was the correct place also if there is another post like this i apologize"
"jugdesh258",2013-04-12,"hmm true from what i recall melisandre and thoros never meet in the book i would have assumed that melisandre is more the master and thoros the padawan but maybe only since melisandre is more the major character nevertheless i think the majority have assumed that they have similar powers that melisandre has not yet demonstrated i think the greyjoys that were headed to mureen also had hooked with a red priest with healing power so it seems common for order everyone complains over the fast travel with certain characters i guess red priests have also mastered breeding of the gold chocobo i could never be bothered with that"
"Iotun",2013-04-12,"i think the speculation is that she is getting gendry who will take the place of edric storm also gives the stannis crew a bit more to do this season as they probably wont be at the wall by season 4 having said that im slightly disappointed that they seem to be making melisandre seem such a dark character since i particularly like her especially after her chapter in dance in the unsullied thread in twp some people want to see her burned alive by dragonfire which i find shocking does she tease davos about his sons death in the books does she burn people alive because they follow a different faith i remember the burning people but my impression was that stannis was killing traitors who were plotting to surrender to the lannisters not just anybody still following the seven and i was also disappointed that she didnt offer cressen an out back in season 2"
"jugdesh258",2013-04-12,"i think that they are always looking for someone to be a victim or sacrifice of melisnadres fires since there is a general shortage of guys condemned to deathand that she is dying to get a hold of someone with kings blood for some reason we can really figure out what is up with these red priests we know that they are supposed to be to opposite of the dark power that is behind the white walkers but they are still kind of dark characters themselves id say this is the reason the story is better then goofy star wars since there is more complicated in the good vs evil thing here it is fire and icewe dont know where the good is on that spectrum"
"Mediumjon Umber",2013-04-12,"its been a long time since i read the novels but i always got the impression that mel is ruthless and very dedicated to her faith so her portrayal on the show is in my opinion quite accurate im very eager to see the interaction between her and thoros if i can recall correctly we havent seen two red priests interacting neither in the books nor on the show and i wonder if thoros will agree on tossing gendry on the pyre i highly doubt it so it will be interesting to hear how each of them explain why their way is the way of rhllor and how they see the red god"
"teemo",2013-04-07,"so  what exactly is the deal here im confused varys hired ros to be littlefingers hand of the pimp so she could get him information aboutwhat is sansa already meeting up with littlefinger why are shae and sansa bff shaes very blatant jealousy will now be weird when tyrion and sansa get married which is obviously the point but these five seem really connected and im kind of confused as to where the show is going with it"

"KoishNoish",2013-04-08,"to be honest im slightly lost too but ill try and convey this how i think it works firstly im just going to say im kindda split on the ros character but im ok with her i think what needs to be noted is that both varys and littlefinger are very big players in the game and that only becomes more apparent after a storm of swords i believe varys may have hired ros just so he could keep an eye on lf in the tv series we have one or two scenes i think between lf and varys in which it is shown they are both very much wary of the other i think varys has planted ros there so he can keep tabs on what lf is doing i think varys is wary of lf and lf is just as wary of varys shae and sansa are bff because i dont know we know she was assigned to be a handmaiden for sansa and in season 2 she helped with the bloody sheets and all that lark so i think sansa trusts her more than others note that she didnt tell shae what lf and her talked about i dont think sansa trusts shae entirely i think shaes jealousy will become more prominent when tyrion and sansa marry it may give us a solid and coherent reason as to why shae was found in tywins bed when tyrion went there ive never been sure whether shae had always been tywins spy or not but i think in the tv series their saying shes not tywins spy and so she turns jealous and thus betrays tyrion i think what will occur is that sansa will marry tyrion like in the books and shae will get jealous for that reason then when joffs wedding comes along and he dies littlefinger will run off with sansa and ros and tyrion will get locked away for the murder of joffrey then i assume the story will continue as the books did before with tyrion finding shae in tywins bed with varys help and sansa getting dragged along with lf i think sansa and ros will probably establish a friendship at that point varys will stay loyal to the books imo and help tyrion escape with motivation from jamie will varys and ros keep in touch i dont know i hope this answers what you were thinking or what you were wondering personally i think its going to stay loyal to the books with just the addition of ros sorry if its a bit long winded"

"juanml82",2013-04-10,"ive been thinking would they use ross in the fake arya role some people is thinking but as a fake sansa instead it has the plot benefits of linking her back to theon she can really desire it until she meets ramsay that is as it will be some serious social climbing and they are much closer in age plus both of them are redheads i mean ross cant pass for arya but may pass for sansa in front of people who doesnt know sansathe weak point is that sansa would have to be officially acquitted of the charges against her regarding the pw maybe sansa gets reliable information about the lannisters wanting her extraofficially dead to cover up for ross and causes her to keep her identity hidden"
"Pinkie Baelish",2013-04-11,"we have discussed ros being a fake sansa in the past but the reason why i dont think it would work as well is because i have a feeling that aryas arc will end up being linked to the boltons and the fake arya ruse"

"Loras",2013-04-08,"so last week after the premiere i created a thread to discuss the action in the episode i felt the scenes in question sam<U+0080><U+0099>s rescue at the fist and barristan saving dany from the manticore were poorly executed with confused direction i was not having a go at the director i think that he can produce great shots and scenes but he does struggle with action the latest episode <U+0080>dark wings dark words<U+0080><U+0099> strengthens my opinion once again during this episode there are two scenes that i believe are poorly directed and poorly executed the first unsurprisingly is the large action set piece of brienne and jaime duelling on the bridge the aerial shots were expensive and reasonably impressive but the close ups during the fight were poor once again minahan seems to be the kind of director who films a scene from every angle possible and only later selects the shots for the sequence it suggests that he has little vision regarding these action sequences compare the fight scene to the beautiful shot of brienne and jaime walking through the fields from distance compare the fight scene to the opening sequence <U+0080><U+0093> my favourite in any <U+0080>thrones<U+0080><U+0099> episode so far the vision and skill that minahan demonstrates in these scenes does not pass over to his lacklustre action scenes for most of the fight scene i felt that i was a couple of seconds behind the action creating a jarring effect akin to last week<U+0080><U+0099>s climax with the manticore the other scene theon<U+0080><U+0099>s torture this scene is handled extremely poorly in my opinion this could be the worst single scene of the entire episode torture <U+0080><U+0093> i imagine never having been tortured i am not an expert on such things <U+0080><U+0093> is intimate it is about the pain within the body which would convince someone to talk if this is true please correct me if i am wrong why were we given this scene from about a million different angles <U+0080><U+0093> including an aerial shot it dragged me straight from the action and shaking my head at minahan<U+0080><U+0099>s erratic style to add to this and i am not sure if it is a hallmark of minahan or the writing but what was with the number of scenes which were shot from the perspective of someone looking into a mirror during the first episode of the season we have tyrion examining his scar <U+0080><U+0093> fine i guess he probably should then in this episode we have a massive overkill joffrey and cersei sansa and shae and joffrey and margaery all have sections where people are talking to reflections it is clumsy heavyhanded and overdone in a 55 minute episode tell me someone else noticed the overuse of this technique i was half expecting iwan rhoen<U+0080><U+0099>s boy to be told to fetch a mirror so that theon could talk to himself so what is my problem i guess it is that a man who can produce such beautiful scenes <U+0080><U+0093> the olenna scene was a feast for the eyes the framing of catelyn during her monologue was heartbreaking brandon<U+0080><U+0099>s dream <U+0080><U+0093> can drop the ball on so many occasions i almost hope that he is not invited back to direct during the 4th season <U+0080><U+0093> or that if he is he is given an episode without any action sequences at all so following on from last week how did you all feel about minahan<U+0080><U+0099>s second and final outing of the season"

"mcbrigno",2013-04-08,"with the setup scene with shae saying we need to protect her sansa im going to make a guess that tyrion rather than tywin is actually going to propose the idea of marrying sansa in order to protect her this could happen for several reasons 1 it further gives the audience reason to believe tyrion is a good man deep down 2 its consistent with tyrion helping sansa anyway even though she will likely not see it that way 3 tywin or joffrey may propose that something be done with her or she be married off to someone else and tyrion will feel bad remember shaes protect her bit and step up to help 4 it would further strike home tyrions feelings towards joffrey during the everyone is mine to torment scene did anyone else get this feeling im betting my money on it it could very well be proposed just as in the books but it seemed like they were setting up for it to happen this way given that scene"

"Iotun",2013-04-08,"its obvious to me that the show is building up a breakdown of tyrion and shaes relationship because of his marriage to sansa i actually thought that the scene was brilliant and shows some long term thinking on behalf of the showrunners and am surprised that some people seem to have found it pointless it builds up tyrion explaining to shae that sansa is a perfect match for any lord coming from an old family and having a pretty face seeming unconcerned about her fate and shae being disgusted with his attitude i think the show will also slightly move away from the direction of the book in how they handle the consummation of the marriage tyrion will not do anything but i think tywin or maybe tyrion himself will let it be known that they have which will disgust shae i definitely think the proposal for the marriage will come from tywin and will not be some kind of scheme that shae and tyrion come up with why would shae think to protect sansa by marrying her to her own lover knowing full well that marriage means consummation with her husband and her obvious disgust at tyrion seeing sansa as attractive i actually like this change quite a bit better than the books much more dramatic and it actually makes tyrion a much greyer character the show makes him seem slightly unconcerned about sansas fate even though hes been semiprotective of her up to know and has shown him a to be have ambition to become a great lord in himself given he wants casterly rock and coolpng classbbcemoticon altb  to consider sansa a great match for any lord i think the marriage will have an element of selfishness on behalf of tyrion i think shae will betray him because of it and he will kill her at the end as he did in the books and it also makes tyrions fall much more heartfelt because he kills a woman whom he actually loved and who actually loved him at one point rather than a young girl who never truly pretended to be anything other than a whore this was definitely one of my favorite scenes in the episode"

"go joff go",2013-04-08,"its obvious to me that the show is building up a breakdown of tyrion and shaes relationship because of his marriage to sansa i actually thought that the scene was brilliant and shows some long term thinking on behalf of the showrunners and am surprised that some people seem to have found it pointless it builds up tyrion explaining to shae that sansa is a perfect match for any lord coming from an old family and having a pretty face seeming unconcerned about her fate and shae being disgusted with his attitude i think the show will also slightly move away from the direction of the book in how they handle the consummation of the marriage tyrion will not do anything but i think tywin or maybe tyrion himself will let it be known that they have which will disgust shaei definitely think the proposal for the marriage will come from tywin and will not be some kind of scheme that shae and tyrion come up with why would shae think to protect sansa by marrying her to her own lover knowing full well that marriage means consummation with her husband and her obvious disgust at tyrion seeing sansa as attractivei actually like this change quite a bit better than the books much more dramatic and it actually makes tyrion a much greyer character the show makes him seem slightly unconcerned about sansas fate even though hes been semiprotective of her up to know and has shown him a to be have ambition to become a great lord in himself given he wants casterly rock and coolpng classbbcemoticon altb  to consider sansa a great match for any lord i think the marriage will have an element of selfishness on behalf of tyrion i think shae will betray him because of it and he will kill her at the end as he did in the books and it also makes tyrions fall much more heartfelt because he kills a woman whom he actually loved and who actually loved him at one point rather than a young girl who never truly pretended to be anything other than a whorethis was definitely one of my favorite scenes in the episodei think we have a winner and i hope its true as its actually a pretty intricate plot where almost everyone is in the right and wrongtywin tyrion shae sansa will all have set themselves up without really realizing it to me its a very clever way to tie up all these threads"
"crazibouncer",2013-04-08,"instead of tyrion proposing the marriage maybe shae who is cool with varys tells him about maybe marrying them because she wants her protected in a council meeting varys tells it to tywin and bam shae then can get jealous or something and lead to you know what i literally just thought f this so it is not fully though out lol"

"wolverine",2013-04-08,"the show will completely ruin sansas arc theres no doubt in that not long ago i said that tv tyrion is much lovable than book tyrion and because of that tv fans will hate sansa for her behaviour in that marriagenever forget that at the moment of his wedding tyrion has nothing and with the wedding he could gain a lot he isnt some prince charming trying to save her from some unthinkable horrorsand if producers pull that on tyrion and sansa ill be really disappointed with their shortsightness when sansas character is concernedthat is a good point i had not considered with how much more likable show tyrion has been sansa could really come off as a bitch to fans of the showeh i dunno about that in 3x02 the episode paired shaes warning to sansa about men only wanting one thing from a pretty girl with tyrion commenting on sansa being a great beauty linking shaes comment about the nefarious intentions of men towards pretty girls with tyrions noticing sansas beauty and shae expressed outrage towards tyrion referring to sansa as a great beauty calling him a pervert and sansa a childi mean it could go any number of ways but it seems like tv sansa and tv tyrion are tracking fairly close to their book selves right now sansa is starryeyed about the tyrells and tyrion views sansa as beautiful but really isnt losing any sleep worrying about her plight sounds about rightnot sure what that has to do with how likable tyrion is to fans of the showi still think they are going to change how cold blooded tyrions killing of shae is from the books maybe he wont kill her at all"
"Newstar",2013-04-08,"not sure what that has to do with how likable tyrion is to fans of the showbecause shaes lines in 3x02 underscore how gross and predatory an older man like tyrions interest in sansa would be given her age which would go some way towards undermining tyrions likability and any attempts down the line to cast him as the helpless victim in the marriage a lot will also depend on the circumstances under which tyrion agrees to the marriage unless tywin straightup coerces him his agreement to the marriage also casts him in the role of an older man preying on a young woman whom he has already identified as a great beauty that could have a big impact on tv tyrions likability as could tv tyrion entering into a marriage despite already being committed to and making protestations of love to shae so i think its relevant yes edited by newstar 08 april 2013  1018 pm"

"Juliads",2013-04-09,"how many viewers interpreted the shaetyrion scene as shae simply being jealous or shae actually feeling protective of sansa im leaning towards shae feeling protective but her delivery is always so quick and playful teasing almost because of this it can be difficult to get a sense of her primary motivations its a grossly overused cliche to have shae take the jealousy route one that most people may automatically assume just because its so commonplace in other forms of entertainment i am still holding onto some glimmer of hope that s3 will be true to tyrions character growth it will be enraging if his marriage to sansa is portrayed as anything other than the landgrabbing power play it was if the writers attempt to make him appear to be the innocent victim or some gallant noble white knight during all of this i will seriously be pissed he has been far too much of a good guy in the show so far this could be a prime moment to begin his downward spiral"
"Woman of War",2013-04-09,"i think that shae was indeed protective of sansa but at the same time i got the impression that she knows more than she tells tyrion that she already has some information concerning lf and sansa that tyrion has not therefore her point is more urgent than she can make tyrion understand so indeed he underestimates shaes concern here but while shae is protective of sansa she is as well very much aware of her personal claim on tyrion no i do not interpret her jealousy on ros as wounded soul i interpret it as erotic banter shae knows very well that it is her who is in power over tyrion in their relationship she wants to make it crystal clear that she is the better fuck compared to ros and the scene very well presents tyrions clumsiness whe it comes to personal relationships he loses his usual eloquence makes feeble excuses and does not understand at all shaes flirtatious manipulations a legitimate game between lovers that shows that tyrion is not only the weaker one here but outright dumb contrasting this with his normal shrewdness and tyrion seeing sansa as great beauty um well she is and even varys loras or some random chambermaid could have made that remark the character sansa is meant to be beautiful for all to see i do not think that this suggests a deeper erotic interest so far and a little admiring is no sin in the books pod is smitten by sansa as well i think it is only shaes remark about the child sansa who physically so obviously is not a child that makes tyrion aware of the less abstract aspects of sansas beauty and shae may be jealous of sansas untouched beauty while feeling protective this is not exclusive but on the other hand she may be legitimately furious if men prefer virginal innocence and erotic cluelessness to the skills of a qualified prostitute or an experienced woman i interpreted the remark about the child sansa as not only protective but as well as shae staking her claims a child can never be as good in bed as i can ill show you with that blowjob and tyrions relationship or marriage of sansa is so much more than land grabbing it is the desperate hopeless attempt to repeat the tysha story to find what can never be found again another tysha completely delusional how they will link tyrions nonrape of sansa to the tysha story i dont know since we never got the whole story in the beginning the way the series is going i do not see much whitewashing of tyrion here so far the impact may only come later than in the books well if it is him who kills shae since shae has feelings for him and for sansa so she may have a good reason to hate him in the end i like the character shae even in the books she is a selfmadewoman but claiming that a prostitute is entitled to perjury since she has no link to her clients is discrimating sex workers as somewhat lesser beings for whom the normal rules of society are not applicable since they are immoral per se"

"Iotun",2013-04-09,"as a man who has had no idea that this test even existed i find it fascinating that a test on feminism is basically completely centred on a measurement of the male element you would imagine that a scene or story would be judged within its own context but apparently the measure of feminism can only be measured by the presence or not of a man essentially we are told that even the measurement of female worth is reliant on the element of the male to be meaningful as if women cannot measure their own feminism without a reference to the male its fascinating you are judging a scene as feminist if it has an absence of a male element and in so doing are actually using the male in your own real life activity of measurement do women really value the worth of their interactions by whether or not men are being referenced in them edited by iotun 09 april 2013  0916 am"

"greensleeves",2013-04-09,"the bechdel test is supposed to determine if a work of fiction portrays women well or not basically a piece of fiction must have a scene in which two women have an entire conversation without mentioning menof course its a ridiculous measure of the presence or lack of sexism in a work two women in one series could pass the bechdel test by talking about how wonderful cleaning cooking and shopping is another pair of women in another series could fail because their business discussion just happened to mention pete from workthis is not what the test measures at all it was never meant to measure these thingsand i agree that the test is so pointlesstruer words have never been postedi am sorry but i have just seen the list of movies that actually passed and i disagree completely with remark that movies are too manconcentrated and sexist towards women for me galadriel in lotrhobbit is the proof that woman can have strength equal or even higher than any man

yes a lengthy debate between two women about breast enlargement botox and high heels that would pass smilepng classbbcemoticon alt  while a discussion of the theory of relativity might fail since einstein might be mentionedunfortunately protar misrepresented this test early on its not meant as a measure of sexism or the strength of female characters it is simply a measure of the presence of women in the work and how womencentered the plot is nothing more nothing less i wish you guys would give it another chancemost filmstv also fail a male bechdel testthis is not trueim not sure the premier passes with flying colours either that convo was rather insipidinsipid convos count and you also have the conversation between ros and shae about sansas birthas a man who has had no idea that this test even existed i find it fascinating that a test on feminism is basically completely centred on a measurement of the male element you would imagine that a scene or story would be judged within its own context but apparently the measure of feminism can only be measured by the presence or not of a man essentially we are told that even the measurement of female worth is reliant on the element of the male to be meaningful as if women cannot measure their own feminism without a reference to the male its fascinating you are judging a scene as feminist if it has an absence of a male element and in so doing are actually using the male in your own real life activity of measurement do women really value the worth of their interactions by whether or not men are being referenced in themagain this is not a test of a movies feminism the purpose of the bechdel test was severely and unfortunately misrepresented early on in the conversationone of the the obvious things injected into this season so far is the increased feminist overtones anyone whining about lack of gender equality on this show is grasping at straws georges books are quite prowoman but this show goes even further to push that agenda so much that it is becoming heavy handed so much so that they have done great disservices to characters like brienne shae cat jeyne talisa ugh and others in trying to weed out negative traits briennes innocence shae being largely an empty whore cat being cruel to jon and generally more assertive and of course talisa as the backtalking nurse in the very first scene she interacts with a king robb and a god damn high lord roose bolton call them simple deviations if you want but there is a clear pattern and ironically it is making these characters less complex and

work i love grrm and admire the strength and variety of his female characters and how they interact with a maledominated worldfor examples i watch homeland and shameless two shows with strong female leads in homeland the main character might be talking to another female but about a terrorist that is a man or in shameless the main character might be talking to another female about her degenerate

thingsshuddersim happy just being someone who displays common human decency thank you tonguepng classbbcemoticon altp  theres far to much baggage associated with the word feminist and the lack of a solid definition is part of the reason i think its kind of pointless  theres no direction and eventually the more extremist groups simply tear the more reasonable groups apartinterestingly grrm used to identify as a feminist until some in the feminism movement im guessing when 2nd wave was at its peak im not an expert on these things decided that only women could define what feminism is and he then thought that the more respectful thing to do would be to stop selfidentifying himself that way i think this is flawed because a patriarchal society hurts men as well as women for me the very name is in some ways flawed because at first glance it can seem to exclude men i cant think of a good alternative term though dunnogif classbbcemoticon altdunno racism doesnt have an equivalent term for examplewell fair enough i mean i dont think that it can be used as a measure of sexism so really weve been on the same side on that matter the entire time but as i like to say people are always entitled to their incorrect opinions so if people want to use it like that im not going to stop them though i will disagree with themi would go with the option that the bechdel test is simply a bit off female interactions regarding men can be meaningful to imply otherwise is to imply that men automatically make a conversation not meaningful which of course is wrongbut surely if the bechdel test is used to determine that the entire industry is sexist it must be implicating that some of the works which fail are sexist right but not all and as you say we must look at each individual film on its own merits to determine which and we also have to do that to determine if there is a meaningful female presence and if the work is female centric so if each work must be analysed in depth before we can say anything about the female presence for an individual film whats the point of the testwhen we apply the bechdel test and the reverse bechdel test to widely released movies in any given year we see a predictable outcome almost all of them will pass the reverse bechdel test and a much larger number of them fail the original bechdel test the fact that this result is consistent year after year means that the bechdel test and its reverse are measuring something if it were random the trend wouldnt be so consistentits not all that unusual for a measure to be useful to study trends in larger groups but not at the individual level the most well known example i can think of right now is bmi body mass index note that i am not a health professional from what i have heard bmi is not good at classifying at the individual level the anecdote ive heard tossed around is that it classifies george clooney as obese however bmi is useful at looking at trends across large populations why is it used in place of methods that might be more accurate for individuals because its easy and cheap it would be prohibitively expensive to use other measures on large populationsif you are a doctor however you shouldnt classify a patient as obese based solely on bmi it might be a warning flag but you should take a closer look or even just a casual looka similar logic justifies the bechdel test it would be nice to do a thorough analysis of gender in all movies and then condense that into understandable trends but its completely impractical also any results would be accused of being madeup or biased the bechdel test and its reverse are relatively easy measurements to takethe consistency of the results of the bechdel test and the reverse bechdel test mean they are definitely capturing

didnt mean for this thread to be a debate on gender issues or even a debate on the value of the bechdel test i honestly just wanted opinions from those more knowledgable than me on some details of application im pretty lenient with my interpretation and think that an exchange should count even if it is part of a larger conversation i think this is the only consistent way because a short exchange could happen outside of the context of a larger conversation and pass the third condition yet both cases would seem to be equally valid i just wanted to know about the whether this episode passed there is a large contingent of people who hang out on this board that i think could give me good answers some of them posted for which i am gratefulin the long summer of my youth last night i

"Lucifer Lightbringer",2013-04-09,"the bechdel test is not a very good metric for judging the portrayal of women in a piece of fiction female characters could pass the bechdel test by talking about how much they love to clean their homes with lemon scented lysol or conversely they could fail by having an intelligent conversation about an esteemed author or public figure it is better to ask a series of analytical questions to judge the purpose of the character within the story and the authors intent for example is the character flawed is the character only meant to represent an ideal is the character multidimensional or a stereotype most if not all of the female characters in asoiaf will prove to be well written strong and realistic that is not so surprising seeing that when asked how he writes female characters martin said something like that he writes them as people because that is what they are theres the only test that matters the show definitely fails when judged on its own because it has a bunch of invented characters whose only dimensions are ta most of the well written female characters from the source material remain intact but that is a credit to the books more than their on screen adaptation"
"karaddin",2013-04-10,"for all that people want to just dismiss it as useless id agree with the point made above about establishing trends vs using it to examine individual cases i also think that by the strict definition this episode does fail although im with you that there is a decent chunk to both the garden scene and cattalisa that would pass until later i think a more meaningful way or perhaps just alternative to look at it is rather than looking at whether a man is mentioned it should instead examine whether the scene is furthering the characterisation of or is about a man or something else under this criteria i think all of the scenes in question would be passes the catelyn scene is very much about cat if anything baby jon in that scene is being referred to just as a proper to further the characterisation of cat the garden scene was similarly about sansa and her opening up and admitting out loud what joff is with a secondary aspect being the reactions of the other two the scenes are furthering the female characters not just serving as off screen characterisation of males which another important thing to look at are the female characters in this story fleshed out realised characters of course through that lens all of got gets a resounding pass"

"greensleeves",2013-04-10,"game of thrones does pass the bechdel test its addition of shae and sansas relationship has been a success in my opinion sansa and the tyrell women were a good example of the books themselves letting female characters have interactions and the show enhances this because they have made margaery more prominent than she was in the books thus making her interactions with sansa more prominent too talisa and cat really havent gotten to the point where their interaction was anything more than exposition but that could changebut just because the show is somewhat good about giving female characters interactions with each other and they have an uphill battle here given the source material and its inspirations doesnt mean they dont have other problems a piece of fiction can be feminist in one way and sexist in another at the same time its perfectly possible that game of thrones has given us more legitimate femalefemale interactions than what we had in the books and that they have given is shitty sexposition scenes have at least on a few occasions used femalefemale interactions as mere titillation that goes back to the bechdel test being just one of many toolssansa is involved in a lot of great or interesting femalefemale relationships arya catelyn cersei shae septa mordane and now margaery and olennathe other major female protagonists have become largely isolated from other women arya hasnt really been around other women since she escaped the kings guard but even before that the most of the female interaction she had was with sansa after the the original parting at winterfell catelyn seems to only be able to have at most one current female relationship at a time season 1 lysa season 2 brienne season 3 talisa dany lost all of her female companionship in season 2 but we were introduced to a new woman in her arc this last episodeit just seems like sansas at the nexus of most of the femalefemale relationships margaery might change that thoughim not sure if i would say that the shows improved on the books in terms of femalefemale relationships they did add in shaesansa but theyve cut out or killed other female charactersi also think that by the strict definition this episode does fail although im with you that there is a decent chunk to both the garden scene and cattalisa that would pass until later i think a more meaningful way or perhaps just alternative to look at it is rather than looking at whether a man is mentioned it should instead examine whether the scene is furthering the characterisation of or is about a man or something else under this criteria i think all of the scenes in question would be passesthe catelyn scene is very much about cat if anything baby jon in that scene is being referred to just as a proper to further the characterisation of cat the garden scene was similarly about sansa and her opening up and admitting out loud what joff is with a secondary aspect being the reactions of the other two the scenes are furthering the female characters not just serving as off screen characterisation of males which another important thing to look at are the female characters in this story fleshed out realised characters of course through that lens all of got gets a resounding passthanks for the input i really liked those scenes too i understand the concern some have about how the catelyntalisa scene reflects on catelyns character as a whole but in this case i choose to view the two mediums books and tv as separate edited by greensleeves 10 april 2013  0616 pm"
"protar",2013-04-09,"to make sure the pw is in s4i say this because i dont know about anyone else but i feel like the kl arc has been a lot slower than it could and should have been so far for the first two episodes each has had one meaningful scene tyriontywin in e2 and olennasansa in e2 but then 3 or 4 other kl scenes that really serve no purpose at least in the premiere it was forgivable seeing as there was a need to recap things but pretty much every scene so far has just been covering old groundif dd had approached things with an open mind and then decided that the pw wouldnt fit then that would be fine but thats not what im feeling here it seems as though they decided from the off that the pw wouldnt be this season and changed everything else to suit thatmeeting olenna could easily have been pushed to episode 1 and then episode 2 could have the small council meeting with tyrion named master of coin and tywin brining up the idea of marrying sansa"

"Clumber",2013-04-09,"id been hoping for the longest time they would have the purple wedding in episode 10 of this season but from what ive heard and from what youve pointed out it unfortunately seems the case that it will be in season 4 i do have to say though that i thought the joffmarg scene with the crossbow was rather well done it might not have added a whole lot but it did show the progression of margs attempts to manipulate and gain a hold over joff and i really am interested to see how that plays out with the rest of the season since we didnt really get to see any of those interactions in the books"
"DragonAge93",2013-04-09,"i prefer a slower story arc in kl i mean this is really only half of asos with one big event already coming up why rush the characters and story just to throw in the pw what would tyrion do for the whole fourth season being in a cell wouldnt be very appealing pw will most likely occur in episode 4 or 5 of season 4 and maybe have the oberyngregor duel in 7 or 8 with tywins death in episode 9 i dont know but i like how we get to see more of the characters fleshed out like margaery taking control of joffrey"

"protar",2013-04-10,"regarding the joffreycersei scene i thought it did progress the plot and have a purpose we already know that the characters have a strained relationship i agree but this scene was much more about cersei than it was about her relationship with her son she is trying to find out how much influence she has lost over him or what he thought about margaeryit is different to the dinner scene because it sets up cerseis paranoia but also her insecurity regarding margaery rather than examining the differences between the two in the context of the books and assuming that the show will continue to follow them the rivalry between cersei and margaery is a driving force for the events of kings landing this scene is only the first step towards that in my opinioneh well personally i dont feel it added anything that hasnt already been added with the time constraints we have i dont think we have time to see every tiny baby step in intercharacter relationships all this can be hinted subtly throughout actual plot developments and the loss of control over joffrey which will come to a head when he outright defies commandsregarding joffreymargaery that is a massive slice of plot development this is the first time in the entire series that we have found a character that can influence joffrey that is huge in my opinion i think this could be the purpose of the mirrors that ended both scenes very clumsy  but whatever after the jc scene we see him standing alone looking in the mirror whereas at the end of the margaery scene they are entwined looking in the mirror together this is a massive shift in the goalpostsi do agree that this scene developed the plot which is why i kept it in my hypothetical outline if its just one idle talking scene that also develops the plot then thats not so bad but when its amongst 3 or 4 such scenes it just feels like wasted timebut i do see the foreshadowing and development here i liked margaerys you are the king which will undoubtedly tie directly into joffreys i am the king later on"
"Peasant Rebel Leader",2013-04-10,"its good to have one setting in the series where not every single little thing has to mean something big the kings landing setting is good for the show because there are a few characters assembled at one place its much more similar to a classical drama such as downton abbey and i feel that game of thrones needs this to be more than a clip show the next time we will have something similar is at the wall with stannis jon sam and maybe yara so these scenes are not pointless but reinforce that kings landing is the central setting and provide a more natural flow of storytelling compare that to fe the very straightforwardness of aryas story or stannisdavos and lastly to me the goal of the series is not to put all scenes from the books in but to provide a good show and in my mind the television medium needs those little scenes in kings landing"

"Lord Varys",2013-04-10,"yes because they dont want to get to the purple wedding this season and because they want to make margaery tyrell a major character the sansa plot could have easily been in season 2 in fact the whole mystery about who might be the person behind dontos if there was any could have been interesting there would have been no need to put this plot in the spotlight in season 2 all they needed to do was establish it instead they felt they had to continue the littlefingerrealcat obsession thing which was set up clumsily and had not a very good climax or resolution of any sort but we have also to keep in mind that the cast is really exploding this season rushing things along while introducing new characters could very well make it impossible for the nonbook audience to follow the story not just at kl but also in all the other locations as well"

"serconjay",2013-04-10,"possible spoiler to people who havent read the books i dunno how to use the spoiler brackets lol i think the pw might be this season is because one of the videos released before the season premiere was about the creators and storytellers discussing how they storyboard each season making sure all characters have a good arc for each season if the pw isnt this season then why would sansas first scene in the premiere be with lf plotting to escape which doesnt happen until the pw i think her escape would be a great arc and it definately sets up the lf storyline"

"protar",2013-04-10,"i find it quite difficult to comprehend that in this thread you are advocating moving the pw to episode 10 which would leave tyrion in prison for the majority of a season  but in the books 45 thread you are wanting the showrunners to press fast forward on tyrions storylineyes because each season and subplot must be taken on an individual basis tyrions adwd arc needs to be sped up i think so that we can finish of s5 with the battle of fire the situation is quite differentit is clear from how this season has been set up that the major story in kings landing is going to be about margaery exerting her influence on joffrey we agreed on this upthread the tyrells have been firmly established over these two episodes  which is very importanti think that the big turning point in episode 10 will be that margaery cannot control joffreys behaviour after the red wedding regarding sansa i think that she will see that he could turn on her which will then lead to setting up the pw in the next seasonso wouldnt the perfect climax for that be the pwthe pw is a big event leading to a climax at the end of the novel  the power shift and tyrion leaving kings landing it doesnt work well as a climax in itselfyes it does every thing in kl builds up to it its simply a climax which also creates new avenues for the story to go down which makes sense because its part way through a very long seriesand honestly given how the forum is divided pretty much evenly on the matter i think that we can assume the show only fans would be fine with either option and wouldnt miss the other one my main problem now is that dd dont seem to be pacing kings landing very well imo maybe i should have named this thread the pacing in kings landing to avoid turning this into another pw thread"
"Joyful Union",2013-04-10,"yes because each season and subplot must be taken on an individual basis tyrions adwd arc needs to be sped up i think so that we can finish of s5 with the battle of fire the situation is quite differentdefinitely you could easily cut 50 of everything tyrion does without losing anything important the greyscale men many of the pentos scenes and allow the climax of the season to take place too as an added bonus"

"Loras",2013-04-10,"yes it does every thing in kl builds up to it its simply a climax which also creates new avenues for the story to go down which makes sense because its part way through a very long seriesjoffreys death doesnt have a huge impact on the political layout of kings landing it provides the vehicle for tyrion and sansas stories through the second half of asosit is not as game changing as the red wedding because the lannisters have tommen as a back up there is still a king on the iron throne he is still a lannisterthe real change which is felt all the way through the books nearly every character arc discusses it at some point is the death of tywin lannister his death is a major event and is much more important than joffreys  both in terms of character development and plot movement after joffreys death the momentum is building to tyrions death or tyrions revengevery few people will actually care about joffs death when it looks like tyrion is going to go down for it it is instantly satisfying but has massive repercussions they shouldnt move it out of context but putting a years gap between the event and the repercussions my main problem now is that dd dont seem to be pacing kings landing very well imo maybe i should have named this thread the pacing in kings landing to avoid turning this into another pw threadthis was always going to happen when you are implying that the kl has been deliberately stalled to ensure that the pw is not in the seasonthough when you compare the opening episodes of season 2 the north remembers and the nightlands to the opening episodes of season 3 i dont think that your argument really stand upepisode 201  the north remembers tyrion arrives in kl and interrupts joffreys birthday celebrations joff is being cruel  something that was established at the end of s1 when he showed sansa poor dead ned  removing marillions tongue cersei gives tyrion an exposition recap of the climax of s1 granted i love this scene shae and tyrion settle into the tower of the hand we have come to a dangerous place cersei and littlefinger have their teteatete regarding power cersei and joffrey clash in the throne room roberts bastards are murdered really amazing sequenceepisode 202  the nightlands varystyrion relationship is established cersei refuses robbs peace terms tyrion exiles janos slynt to the wall cersei reveals that she didnt order the murder of roberts bastards and joffrey didlooking at those two episodes we see that tyrion establishes himself in kings landing and firmly in power cersei loses control of joffrey again the scene between cersei and littlefinger doesnt really go anywhere the friendship between varys and tyrion is established toocompare that to this season we are introduced properly to a whole new set of characters the tyrells ones that dont have a lot of power because they are women we see margaery deftly playing the game  with the orphans and later with joffrey we see the start of a friendship between margaery and sansa margaery has already manipulated joffrey the first time anyone has managed to do this since the beginning of the show the rivalry between cersei and margaery is established as well as the whole thing with roslittlefingersansashae tyrion knows he wont receive his birthright and cracks are showing in his relationship with shaecompared to s2 the s3 kl arc seems to be looking forward in these first two episodes rather than backwards"
"protar",2013-04-10,"joffreys death doesnt have a huge impact on the political layout of kings landing it provides the vehicle for tyrion and sansas stories through the second half of asosit is not as game changing as the red wedding because the lannisters have tommen as a back up there is still a king on the iron throne he is still a lannisterthe real change which is felt all the way through the books nearly every character arc discusses it at some point is the death of tywin lannister his death is a major event and is much more important than joffreys  both in terms of character development and plot movement after joffreys death the momentum is building to tyrions death or tyrions revengevery few people will actually care about joffs death when it looks like tyrion is going to go down for it it is instantly satisfying but has massive repercussions they shouldnt move it out of context but putting a years gap between the event and the repercussionswhen analysed more deeply joffreys death doesnt change much but that doesnt mean its not a dramatic cathartic event which would make for a very exciting finale whilst also opening up new plots it is also when all the plotting in kl comes to a head capping off the rivalry with tyrion and cersei the tyrells gaining power lfs scheming it all comes together in this scene which is why i think it would have made an excellent climaxthis was always going to happen when you are implying that the kl has been deliberately stalled to ensure that the pw is not in the seasonwhich is why im wondering if i should really have bought that up its a concern of mine but really its not so important to me what was going through dds mind which we cant really know short of them telling us but what the result is i guess i should have focused on thatthough when you compare the opening episodes of season 2 the north remembers and the nightlands to the opening episodes of season 3 i dont think that your argument really stand upepisode 201  the north remembers tyrion arrives in kl and interrupts joffreys birthday celebrations joff is being cruel  something that was established at the end of s1 when he showed sansa poor dead ned  removing marillions tongue cersei gives tyrion an exposition recap of the climax of s1 granted i love this scene shae and tyrion settle into the tower of the hand we have come to a dangerous place cersei and littlefinger have their teteatete regarding power cersei and joffrey clash in the throne room roberts bastards are murdered really amazing sequenceepisode 202  the nightlands varystyrion relationship is established cersei refuses robbs peace terms tyrion exiles janos slynt to the wall cersei reveals that she didnt order the murder of roberts bastards and joffrey didlooking at those two episodes we see that tyrion establishes himself in kings landing and firmly in power cersei loses control of joffrey again the scene between cersei and littlefinger doesnt really go anywhere the friendship between varys and tyrion is established tooto me those scenes are all much more important and move the plot along more than the s3 scenes the only scene where i would agree with you and say its pointless is the lfcersei scene though you could argue it sets up the power theme for the entire season i would argue its stupid but there we areall the other scenes are meaningful because they establish the dynamics that werent there in s1 now that were much further into the show most of the dynamics tyrionshae tyrionvarys joffreycersei not getting on have already been long established we dont need scenes reestablishing themcompare that to this season we are introduced properly to a whole new set of characters the tyrells ones that dont have a lot of power because they are women we see margaery deftly playing the game  with the orphans and later with joffrey we see the start of a friendship between margaery and sansa margaery has already manipulated joffrey the first time anyone has managed to do this since the beginning of the show the rivalry between cersei and margaery is established as well as the whole thing with roslittlefingersansashae tyrion knows he wont receive his birthright and cracks are showing in his relationship with shaecompared to s2 the s3 kl arc seems to be looking forward in these first two episodes rather than backwardsid say that with the exception of olenna weve already been thoroughly introduced to the tyrells we got to know margaery well in season 2 even if she wasnt affecting the plot too much and loras has been developed as far back as season 1 and as i say i thought that the olenna scene was good probably the best of the episode so were in agreement theremy complaint is mainly with episode 2 in case that wasnt made clear previously and by episode 2 the rivalry between cersei and margaery has already been established marg is already starting to exert control over joff and we most certainly know that lf is up to know good with sansa and that shae is sansas bff madly in love with tyrion every single scene in kl e2 is a repeat of one of these now obviously each character dynamic must be touched on multiple times to be effective but were seeing very little progression in these dynamics with each scene you can argue that this makes the show subtle and intelligent but i dont think we have time for these baby steps im always open to exceptions but my general preference in fiction is cut to the chase edited by protar 10 april 2013  0150 pm"

"oierem",2013-04-06,"i kind of wish they had left those jonsam scenes for later episodes unless there is some significant advance in their plots i dont like it when we have only one short scene for a plotline in an episode i think thats what makes it feel like it just skips aroundthe premiere didnt felt that way to me though i think its because the main focus was kl davos and dany and a lot happened in those arcs i think the premiere was meant to reintroduce all the big players so moving around those stannis arya and bran scenes was probably a good decisionthe main focus of the premiere was in kl dragonstone and dany and except for kl which will appear in every episode the other two wont appear wise move but we only saw one scene with sam jon and robb so its natural that those storylines will continue in episode 2the big scene at crasters happens in episode 4 which means that we need to see more of them before that episodethe first half of jons season is about him living with the wildlings a slowish storyline that has to establish several characters and offer some internal conflict for jon i think its appropriate that we will see a bit of him in every episode from 1 to 5 you cannot push the plot too much until they climb the wall in episode 6robb and cat should be important players this season so it was logical to appear in the premiere as well as in the second episodeon the other hand i guess well see the arrival of the qot i assume we have to see something with ther meeting with cersei tyrion tywin before the big scene with sansa right"
