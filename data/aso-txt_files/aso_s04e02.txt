6	SOSRadio	2014-04-13	Starting off with Ramsay I see.
7	Madfunkymonkey	2014-04-13	Cutting from Theon to a sausage is just wrong.
8	Warhawk137	2014-04-13	Well that was... alarming.
9	Rhasgul	2014-04-13	Starting off with Ramsay I see.


God I have been waiting for this scene for such a long time.
Â 
Also, so happy to have found a stream as it's usually a bitch finding a direct stream in Europe
10	Warhawk137	2014-04-13	Side note, there's a change that could work brilliantly.
11	Fragile Bird	2014-04-13	Who the hell was that woman hunting with Ramsay?
12	Rashtibram	2014-04-13	What's alarming?
Â 
I can't see the episode until tomorrow.

Very much yes.

15	Greywolf2375	2014-04-13	ok...so not a fan of the first two scenes.Â  We know Ramsay is a sick bastard, like to see how that adds to the characters/story.
Â 
And not really liking that it isn't Ilyn he is sparring with.Â  Bronn can still speak and that is still a risk that didn't have to be taken.
16	Rhasgul	2014-04-13	Oh my god the laughter at Locke and Ramsay being torturebuddies
17	Rhasgul	2014-04-13	What's alarming?

This is an interesting link, decent article about the new episode, might want to have a look
18	Onna Lewyys	2014-04-13	I'm actually really glad that they are revealing Ramsay in all his sadistic, evil, people-hunting glory in the same episode as killing Joffrey. It's kind of like passing the psychopathic torch.
19	MsLibby	2014-04-13	With the actor who played Ilyn being so sick, Bronn was the more logical choice I guess. Still, he can talk so it actually makes what jaime is doing more dangerous. I know a lot of people haad hoped Brienne would become his sparring partner, but that wouldÂ  have been too ......expected.
20	Lady Olenna	2014-04-13	Fat Walda is actually fat!!! 
I thought they cast a skinny actress so I'm glad to see she's not.
21	Rhasgul	2014-04-13	Fat Walda is actually fat!!!
I thought they cast a skinny actress so I'm glad to see she's not.


What... why... why would they? they'd have no reason whatsoever to make her skinny :s
22	Greywolf2375	2014-04-13	Like the look of that chalice!
23	Greywolf2375	2014-04-13	I like how everyone squints with a 'WTF did he just say?"
Â 
where is "I am no stranger..."?

24	AnotherCrannogman	2014-04-13	Shae already known by tywin?
25	Rhasgul	2014-04-13	Goddammit they had the PERFECT opportunity to have him say "I've handled Valyrian steel before, I know how to wield it!" and have all the unsullied shocked at how how far he takes it. Which would justify the end of the episode even more to them

I still don't get this. They recast The Mountain three times, and they recast Daario, but they couldn't recast Ilyn Payne?
27	Fragile Bird	2014-04-13	I don't like the way they're doing the Tyrion - Shae break.Â  So far.Â  Is she going to escape, Tyrion not's going to murder her?Â  Or does Bronn betray Tyrion, and hand over Shae?Â  Well, it will be interesting to see what happens.
28	MsLibby	2014-04-13	I still don't get this. They recast The Mountain three times, and they recast Daario, but they couldn't recast Ilyn Payne?


Â 
I'm assuming they didn't need yet another character with little or nothing to do. I think they need to give Bronn a bigger role at the beginning of this season to keep in the forefront of the story. Makes his treachery even harder in a few weeks.
29	Crazeejezza	2014-04-13	I still don't get this. They recast The Mountain three times, and they recast Daario, but they couldn't recast Ilyn Payne?


Â 
None of the other actors for The Mountain or Daario were dying. It was out of respect that they retired Ser Ilyn
30	Greywolf2375	2014-04-13	So Shae is the one who sees truly, yet is this broken up by it?Â  Granted, Tyrion took the wood to her there, but still.
31	Rhasgul	2014-04-13	I don't like the way they're doing the Tyrion - Shae break.Â  So far.Â  Is she going to escape, Tyrion not's going to murder her?Â  Or does Bronn betray Tyrion, and hand over Shae?Â  Well, it will be interesting to see what happens.


As Tywin knows, he'll make sure she doesn't get to leave i guess, would be too much of a deviation to her escape imho
32	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-04-13	Goodbye, my friend.
There's no need to cry.
We'll never see him again, will we?
Sure we will! We can just follow his footprints.
Footprints.
33	Minsc	2014-04-13	Â

Â 
Yeah, IIRC they did the same for Old Nan after her actress passed away.
34	Gran de Lys	2014-04-13	Yeah. I couldn't and still can't figure it out. It seems as if Bronn helps/makes Shae go away. Which would be super anti-climactic for certain people (me) who are waiting to see her

81	Fragile Bird	2014-04-13	Joffrey should have been coughing before he drank the wine.Â  That would have made it more ambiguous as to who murdered Joffrey.Â  Here, they seem to try to make it more clear cut that it was Tyrion, even though there doesn't seem to have been any opportunity to poison the wine.

How do you get that? We all know it's no Tyrion
86	Fragile Bird	2014-04-13	Decent death scene for Joffrey, though.
Â 
And were any of the dwarves female?Â  Have we eliminated the character of Penny?

They did have the QoT unnecessarily in the frame right before Tyrion served him, and she was the first non-family member to react. Â Subtle clues, but not nothing.
88	jons nissa	2014-04-13	yes, that was the first thing i noticed too. no girl dwarf. but that doesn't mean she won't show up later.

They do have him take a sip of the wine once with no issue. Â It wasn't until it was placed by Marg next to Olenna that Joffrey started coughing though.
95	LyrnaSnowBunnyAvenger	2014-04-13	Where do you go to see the unsullied reactions?Â  I only have one RL friend who watches GoT and she also read the books.

96	Wmarshal	2014-04-13	They killed Axell, and made him a seven worshipper, THOSE ANIMALS!!!
97	WrathOfTinyKittens	2014-04-13	Gleason really nailed the character of Joffrey, just as much as Dinklage nailed Tyrion.

Â yes, QoT could have done something, but the way they are framing the scene they are making it appear that it can only be him even though the two times he filled the goblet everyone was watching him.
Â 


Â 
How do you get that? We all know it's no Tyrion


Â no, we all don't know it's not Tyrion...some people do, some don't.Â  People watching the show who have never read the books may not have any clue there could be someone other than Tyrion - especially since (as things stand right now) there were no gems mising from Sansa's necklace.
99	Colonel Green	2014-04-13	Weirdly, the promo for next week makes it look like Margaery wasn't in on it.
100	Trebla	2014-04-13	Was that Jack Gleeson singing The Rains of Castamere during the credits???
101	E-Ro	2014-04-13	The stannis scene ruined the whole episode for me.I cant possibly think of a more effective way to demonize a character.
102	Fat Mac	2014-04-13	That was gruesome. Like his death in the books, I'm not sure I can applaud it.
Â 
The looks on several characters faces before the death were important. Tywin's, Olenna's, Margaery's, Oberyn's..... I can see that the creators are trying to keep the Unsullied guessing as to who poisoned the King.
103	Fool of a Book	2014-04-13	Â yes, QoT could have done something, but the way they are framing the scene they are making it appear that it can only be him even though the two times he filled the goblet everyone was watching him.

Ohhh you missed the part where Lady O fussed with Sansa then. Â Watch the repeat.
Â 
She clearly plucks at the necklace. Â Which isn't obvious if you aren't looking, but they did make a point of Sansa touching the cup.

Â 
yes, the way the scene was filmed really makes it look like it was tyrion. does hbo want us to think it was him? why doesn't it look like a stone is missing from sansa's necklace?
Â 
while the wedding scene was awesome and the tension, fabulous, it removes all sympathy for joffrey's murder. i know grrm has said he really tried to make us feel that a child was murdered through cersei's grief. having cersei go into bitch mode so quickly as well as joff's over the top behavior seconds before the wine made that impossible.
105	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-04-13	It appears Bronn will take the place of Ilyn Payne as Jamie's secret sword practice person.
106	MoIaF	2014-04-13	It was sad, definitely not a good death. 
They were definitely showing us the Queen of T being next to the cup.  Although they should have made Tyrion's innocence a little more ambiguous.
107	LyrnaSnowBunnyAvenger	2014-04-13	Tha little threat from Oberyn to Cersei was nice


Â 
Oberyn needs much more facetime while still among the living.Â  It's going to suck when he dies (as it did in the books), but he is just so awesome badassery - I love his threats to the Lannisters.Â  His fight against the Mountain is going to be epic.
108	Mya Stone	2014-04-13	My unspoiled sister picked up on Olenna right away.Â

111	Warhawk137	2014-04-13	Look, the point is, for the purposes of framing the story in the TV show, irrespective of what happens in the book, they sorta have to make it look like it was probably Tyrion, BUT that it's conceivable it could have been someone else.
Â 
I think they pulled it off with as many places as that cup went.
Â 
That said, if D&D really want to pull a shocking swerve on us, they'll make it so that the poison was... dun dun dun... in the PIE.
112	Moseh Khayim	2014-04-13	Best line?

113	Colonel Green	2014-04-13	while the wedding scene was awesome and the tension, fabulous, it removes all sympathy for joffrey's murder. i know grrm has said he really tried to make us feel that a child was murdered through cersei's grief. having cersei go into bitch mode so quickly as well as joff's over the top behavior seconds before the wine made that impossible.


GRRM was kidding himself there.Â  If you want people to feel a bit sad at a child being killed, don't make him a one-dimensional psychopath without a single redeeming quality.Â  Nobody was ever going to feel sad that Joffrey died.
114	jons nissa	2014-04-13	The stannis scene ruined the whole episode for me.
I cant possibly think of a more effective way to demonize a character.

but he was so clearly not happy about it! i think they're really showing he's not in the same camp as mel and selyse.Â
115	Fragile Bird	2014-04-13	Ohhh you missed the part where lady O fussed with Sansa then. Â Watch the repeat.


No one missed that scene - you could see that all the stones were still there.
Â 
Unless that was the reason they changed the stones to pale blue instead of deep purple, so we would miss the fact a stone was missing.
116	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-04-13	When Joffrey grabbed the cup away from Tyrion you could tell there was no wine in it. It was empty. Then he took a sip from it, as if wine was filled almost to the top.
117	CrypticWeirwood	2014-04-13	You're right! We COULD see all the dwarfs' faces. Huh.


Â 
So? Â One could still be Penny. Â After all, everybody knows that only another dwarf can tell the difference between male and female dwarves. : - )

120	-Ghost-	2014-04-13	So are they gonna have Oberyn and Loras hook up then? Cause they had them staring pretty hard. I hope not
121	Newstar	2014-04-13	Loving the Spanish tweets. "Y SANSA AYUNDADO A TYRION. AY, MIS FEELS" ("And Sansa helping Tyrion. Oh, my feels"). 
Â 
There wasn't that moment from the books where Tyrion deliberately poured out the rest of the wine in the cup, was there?
Â 
Did Tommen even have one line?

Yeah he looked pissed, I noticed that in the promo last week too.
123	Fat Mac	2014-04-13	The stannis scene ruined the whole episode for me.
I cant possibly think of a more effective way to demonize a character.


Â 
I think it's clear the creators want to show Stannis having a moral dilemma. Problem is, I don't think they're doing a good job of it at all.
124	Fragile Bird	2014-04-13	My unspoiled sister picked up on Olenna right away.Â 
And there was a gem missing from Sansa's necklace. On the right side (her left) by her hair.Â 
Â 


Yeah, sure, brag about that 80 inch tv set.

I was trying to watch QoT in the background after that happened but she wasn't in all the frames. I mean obviously she did it, but I'm wondering how kong they're going to keep the unsullied guessing.
Also that Jaime/Loras scene was glorious.

I can't decide. Obviously she didn't get on the boat, so has Bronn turned at this point?
132	Newstar	2014-04-13	I'm back to thinking they're going to have Tywin kill Shae and it will be a total total whitewash of the whole thing.


Â 
My impression was that Shae would go scorched earth on Tyrion for revenge.
Â 
Oooh, though, I really like Chebyshov's idea that Bronn is already bought off and is already lying to Tyrion about Shae. Nice.
Â 
Also liked Oberyn reminding Cersei that Myrcella was effectively the Martells' hostage and subtly threatening Myrcella's safety. Well done.

134	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-04-13	Was that Jack Gleeson singing The Rains of Castamere during the credits???


I'd assume it wasÂ JA3n A<U+009E>A3r Birgisson. Â I doubt Jack's voice is that good, but I know his enunciation is better. Â That sounded like someone who doesn't speak English (or is it the Common Tongue?) singing phonetically.
135	Lord Godric	2014-04-13	There's plenty of time to establish the fact that Sansa's necklace played a role in the murder. Â I don't see why D&D wouldn't do that. Â In the books it happened shortly after the wedding, so I'm hoping next week Sansa tells Dontos that the necklace is missing a stone.
136	Colonel Green	2014-04-13	They did an excellent job, once again, of writing Sansa out of her own POV chapter.Â  She had, what, two lines, and no scenes of her own?Â  And no agency whatsoever.
Â 
The death was handled fairly nicely.
Â 
The Bolton scenes were quite good, actually, which is a nice change of pace.
137	Madfunkymonkey	2014-04-13	He died, aye


well two good things then.

I will stop complaining, but man, they may as well have had him talk about his "final solution" for westeros.
139	Boggsy Cyvasse	2014-04-13	The effects/make-up department outdid themselves with Joffrey's face as he suffocated. Awesome. The tension between Tyrion and Joffrey was palpable. You could have cut it with a Valyrian steel sword.
Â 
P.S. During the credits, The Rains of Castamere, really almost sounded like it could have been Jack Gleeson singing it.
140	Chebyshov	2014-04-13	There's plenty of time to establish the fact that Sansa's necklace played a role in the murder. Â I don't see why D&D wouldn't do that. Â In the books it happened shortly after the wedding, so I'm hoping next week Sansa tells Dontos that the necklace is missing a stone.

That plus the preview showed a scene between Margery and Olenna clearly discussing the poisoning. I'm guessing they might just be explicit about it there so the audience knows Tyrion is innocent
141	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-13	Â 
Yeah he looked pissed, I noticed that in the promo last week too.


he looked like grumpy cat.
142	Hodor knows	2014-04-13	When Joffrey grabbed the cup away from Tyrion you could tell there was no wine in it. It was empty. Then he took a sip from it, as if wine was filled almost to the top.


Â Absolutely. Joff snatched the cup away and it was obviously empty.
Â 
Good episode, but I think the show might be making more deviations than I am comfortable with.
143	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-04-13	Was that Jack Gleeson singing The Rains of Castamere during the credits???

No. Sigur Ros lol. 
Btw the two unsullied I watched it with think Oberyn had something to do with the poisoning since he hates Lannisters so much.
144	Cas Stark	2014-04-13	I can't decide. Obviously she didn't get on the boat, so has Bronn turned at this point?


Â 
My guess is Varys, Bronn mentions Varys in the scene, I think.
Â 
I really disliked this. Â Back to Shae Superwoman Whore. Â She loves Tyrion and WTF? He thinks it's better to tell her he wants her to leave because she's a whore instead of to save her life? Â When did he get this stupid?
145	AugustusCaesar	2014-04-13	The Stannis scene was quite pointless. He is still portrayed as somewhat of a villain to the unsullied. I hope they change that before he marches to the Wall.
146	Scrambled Aegon	2014-04-13	Fucking hell that was great
147	Mya Stone	2014-04-13	Yeah, sure, brag about that 80 inch tv set.

Hey, it's 60 inches, not 80! Â
148	Chebyshov	2014-04-13	Also can we please talk about that awkward moment with Cersei and Brienne??
149	jons nissa	2014-04-13	Â

Oooh, though, I really like Chebyshov's idea that Bronn is already bought off and is already lying to Tyrion about Shae. Nice.


Â 
yes, i was wondering about that. "i saw her to the ship and i wasn't followed." Â  Â yeah, right.
Â 
anyway, i don't like how they played that scene, it felt really unrealistic to have shae crying while tyrion's lying. the whole thing didn't flow, imho. but they had to get shae to turn somehow.

is it possible that she did geto n the boat, but was somehow redirected or Vayrs had someone bring her back ?
154	Ser Creighton	2014-04-13	Joffrey should have been coughing before he drank the wine.Â  That would have made it more ambiguous as to who murdered Joffrey.Â  Here, they seem to try to make it more clear cut that it was Tyrion, even though there doesn't seem to have been any opportunity to poison the wine.

Well Tyrion touches the cup and wine, Sansa touches the cup and the thorn in the Lions paw is sitting right next to the cup when Tyrion picks it up off the table to give to Joff. They make sure she is in the shot.
Now for a moment of silence to honor the legendary King Joffrey Baratheon first of his name, hero of the Black water, who single handedly defeated all five Kings without breaking a sweat, who exposed and Ned Stark for the treasonous bastard he was, who gave the evil Sansa a proper beating, the god king to whom the world bent the knee. His kind heart that gave Jobs to dwarves when no one else would, who fed the belligerent peasants with a firm hand and love instead of things like pretentious food, who took in a Queen who had lost her king and made her his wife, who out smarted Tyrion the stupid evil dwarf time and time again. The man the myth the modern day warrior King Joffrey Baratheon who may now rule the seven heavens as he once ruled the seven kingdoms.
155	Chebyshov	2014-04-13	is it possible that she did geto n the boat, but was somehow redirected or Vayrs had someone bring her back ?

This would make sense if Varys really did plant her in Tywin's tower like some people suspect.
156	FNF	2014-04-13	The character assassination of Stannis is mind-blowing. Kin-slaying over a religion he is not totally devout to? Really stupid move by D&D. They should have kept the fact that Lord Florent tried to betray Stannis to the Lannisters and thus it was a justifiable execution.

Jack Gleeson ye will be missed.Â
158	Skywarpgold	2014-04-13	Ohhh you missed the part where Lady O fussed with Sansa then. Â Watch the repeat.
Â 
She clearly plucks at the necklace. Â Which isn't obvious if you aren't looking, but they did make a point of Sansa touching the cup.


Â 
And actually, there's a HUGE audio clue: As the QoT walks by the main table after touching Sansa's necklace (there's also a quick scene of the necklace WITHOUT one of the gems, you can see the empty gem holder), she drops her hand, and you can hear a "plink" as she drops the gem into something (I think it was the wine bottle itself). It's rather subtle, I had to rewind to listen again.

I'm getting worried about this too. How bad would it be if Shae was kidnapped by Cersei/Tywin and forced to testify against Tyrion and then raped by Tywin, but when Tyrion finds her he doesn't believe her? Or is that a good thing?
162	Doloorous Edd cracks me up	2014-04-13	Goddamn, I'm going to miss Jack Gleeson.

Then why did the poisoning take so long?Â
164	l2 0 5 5	2014-04-13	Bronn was a nice sub in for Ser Ilyn to practice with Jaime.
Â 
The consistent camera nods to the new Tommen were a nice indicator that the Purple Wedding was about to go down.Â 
Â 
The Ramsay/Roose/Reek (R cubed???) relationship was awesome. Â What a great clash those characters have together. Â 
Â 
I felt like Joff's coughing could've been better which is a weird thing to nitpick about I know but it just seemed really forced; however, that scene was pretty much word for word from the book which I respect and am not surprised about since GRRM wrote the episode.
165	NightStark	2014-04-13	It was good to see Ned back..albeit for 2 seconds
166	Darth Pipes	2014-04-13	GRRM's episode was a bit of a misfire last season but this one was pretty great.Â  What a horribly uncomfortable wedding peppered in with some great character interaction and performances.
Â 
Very interesting they didn't have the reveal that Joffrey was behind the plot to kill Bran.Â  I actually wondered last year if they would reveal this as they had showed Joffrey being an even greater shit on the show that revealing the Bran thing would garner no real surprise.
Â 
Looks like we're seeing the birth of Batshit Crazy Cersei.Â  Not just the end with her father but her ability to make stupid decisions by deciding that the leftovers would go to the kennels instead of the poor.
Â 
Terrific performance by Peter Dinklage but I'm getting tired of the show portraying him as a total angel.
Â 
The Bolton interaction was shown and was a good look at how the minds of Roose and Ramsay function.Â  Of course Ramsay and Locke would get along just great.Â  Very interesting that the plotting against Jon is beginning now.Â  This storyline should be good this year.Â  Alfie Allen is handling the Reek stuff well.
Loved Loras burning Jaime with the "Neither will you!" line.
Â 
No dwarves on pigs but that "War of Five Kings" bit was brutal.
Â 
Sophie Turner didn't have much dialogue tonight but did a hell of a job with her non-verbal reactions.
Â 
Given the shows lack of subtlety, it was nice that they didn't give away who had poisoned Joffrey at all.Â  Next week's preview seems to imply that Maegarey didn't know about it after all.
Â 
Best of luck to Jack Gleeson.Â  He brought his best to the role tonight, showing Joffrey in all his degenerate "glory."
167	Newstar	2014-04-13	Because we don't have the benefit of Tyrion's POV of the wedding where it's clear he has no involvement in what's happening, I think the show will clarify very quickly that Tyrion is innocent.
168	Cas Stark	2014-04-13	If he tells her it's to save her life, she'll just protest that she can protect herself etc.
Â 
He's being cruel to be kind.


Â 
I thought it was extremely stupid, and she isn't that dumb in the show. Â My sister and father will kill you, so you have to get on the boat, end of discussion is much more sensible than what they did.
169	Chebyshov	2014-04-13	I also have to remark that the Ramsey and Roose scene was nicely done. Â I was wary about spending so much time at the Dreadfort, but I liked it.Â 

It was, but I'm confused about Myranda. She was one of the girls from Theon's castration scene last year, but she can't be the same Myranda who's friends with Mya Stone, right?
170	Raksha 2014	2014-04-13	I was seriously expecting more intense grief from Cersei; it seemed like she went from numbness to rage against Tyrion without the horror and pain I would think she'd feel on the death of her firstborn.
Â 
But in general, good job with the wedding and festivities. Â Loved the Oberyn/Tywin/Cersei confrontation, Loras and Jaime (and what was going on between Oberyn and Loras - Oberyn looking at Loras like Loras was dessert). Â  Great acting from whasisname playing Ramsay when Roose introduced Fat Walda to him; that gleeful evil smile and the glint in his eyes. Â If I were Walda, I'd go home to the Twins.
Â 
Don't know what's going on with Shae; but it's likely, as others have suggested, that Tywin got a hold of her and bribed Bronn to lie to Tyrion. Â Though that makes Bronn worse than he was in the books; where he did not act for Tyrion in ASOS but he didn't double-cross him either.

Got a 70 not that size matters to a guy or anything, but mines bigger, it's bigger, hahaha seriously my tv is huge. Sometimes I have to watch stuff twice because it's so big I can only watch half the screen at one time.
172	SeventySeven	2014-04-13	hmmm, I thought it was a bit underwhelming compared to the books. The build up was good, but the actual moment... Cersei's reaction was a bit off, too. She was fine at the end, but she was just staring at Joff when he was dying, in the books she's in panic, screaming.
Â 
It was good overall, not amazing. I think they did better with the RW, despite the fact it was very different from the books.
Â 
Also, the actress who plays Shae is the most unconvincing at crying.Â
173	Stannis I	2014-04-13	I understand why they changed most of the things, including Sir Illyn, but two things I don't get:
Â 
1) Why Melisandre was burning Ser Axell Florent, instead of Ser Alester, and why he suddenly became Selyse's brother. Also, Stannis didn't command his death because he was a sinner (which would make him more of a fanatic), but because he tries to negotiate a peace treaty with Tywin Lannister behind Stannis' back.
Â 
2) Why Lady Olenna doesn't put her hands on Sansa's necklace, to remove one of the gems, possibly containing the poison that killed Joffrey.
174	Fragile Bird	2014-04-13	Well Tyrion touches the cup and wine, Sansa touches the cup and the thorn in the Lions paw is sitting right next to the cup when Tyrion picks it up off the table to give to Joff. They make sure she is in the shot.
Â 


The problem is, you can't poison someone's cup just by touching the stem or the bowl of the cup. Â If the QoT did it, she did it off screen.
Â 
But my whole original point was the fact that he should have started coughing before he drank the wine, because I belong to the faction that believes the pie was poisoned, not the wine. Â Of course, there are whole threads on that issue.
175	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-04-13	The entire wedding was great. Loved the entire build-up to the final shot. Joffrey looked like a fucking zombie.
Â 
And darkside Tyrion discarding Shae. That's going to be ugly.
Â 
Wish people would cut it out with the 'whitewashing' of Tyrion bullshit. If he doesn't end up killing Shae, complain all you want, but at least wait until the damn episode airs before you start whining.

Â 
Omg!! Bronn trains Jaime! Omg! Lord Oaf! Omg...Bran's sequence! Bloodraven voiceover! Omg everything.Â
177	Nictarion	2014-04-13	Decent episode, some good visuals. Lena and Jack were great. Joffrey's face was gruesome, pretty much how I always pictured it.
My favorite part was definitely Bran and the Weirwood tree, very cool scene. Bloodraven!!!
178	Lord Godric	2014-04-13	I also found it interesting that Bran is starting to get visions. Â In the first season the producers were so strongly against giving him dreams, for whatever reasons, but it looks like they can no longer avoid it. Â Snow on the throne, dragons over King's Landing. Â Interesting stuff.Â
179	Bluecore	2014-04-13	Because we don't have the benefit of Tyrion's POV of the wedding where it's clear he has no involvement in what's happening, I think the show will clarify very quickly that Tyrion is innocent.


Â 
Â 
You can see that is exactly what happens in the "next week on..." segment following the credits. Margaery and Olenna are having a heated discussion.Â
180	kairparavel	2014-04-13	I am convinced the new queen put the poison in the cup after getting it from grandma.
Â 
His death scene was great And bonus? Something that actually happened.
181	jons nissa	2014-04-13	I was seriously expecting more intense grief from Cersei; it seemed like she went from numbness to rage against Tyrion without the horror and pain I would think she'd feel on the death of her firstborn.
Â 


Â 
yes, i think they should have had her grieving more before she went into her rage. too rushed.
182	Chebyshov	2014-04-13	I understand why they changed most of the things, including Sir Illyn, but two things I don't get:

Â 
2) Why Lady Olenna doesn't put her hands on Sansa's necklace, to remove one of the gems, possibly containing the poison that killed Joffrey.

Number 1 who knows, but number 2 she does. Just rewatch...the far right jewel is missing and you can see Olenna briefly touch it
183	Newstar	2014-04-13	And darkside Tyrion discarding Shae. That's going to be ugly.
Â 
Wasn't it sort of the emotional equivalent of Arya chucking rocks at Nymeria to drive her off, though? I don't think he would have told her any of that unless he thought it was the only way to sever the relationship.
184	rmholt	2014-04-13	The show outdid the books in the dwarf contest and the Reek-Ramsay-Roose scenes. The War of a Five Kings was so...Joffrey
Finally someone at HBO who can do makeup for a strangling...looking at you, The Wire.
Didn't Final Joffrey look JUST LIKE FINAL JACK TORRANCE?? Only warmer.
Once again I disagree with an actor characterizing her scene even though I thought she did it just right. I interpreted Brienne's reaction to be horror in the face of such bad manners from a virtual stranger. She's all about propriety and honor. Her personal feelings re: romance aren't to be discussed, even with herself, no matter what they are.
Lady Olenna looked suspicious to me but I was watching her. So if guilt was supposed to be more ambiguous I missed it.
185	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-13	I was ready to watch the episode and a friend fainted. FAINTED. In front of me... it was awful. By the time we got her home I only managed to see the end, when Joffrey started to choke.
Â 
It
Â 
Was
Â 
AWFUL.
Â 
Â 
which mean, it was AMAZING. Long live the cunt King.
Â 
And Jack Gleeson, you will be missed, kiddo. I've never felt so much joy hating someone.
186	Trebla	2014-04-13	Then why did the poisoning take so long?Â 


It didn't take that long. The QoT slipped the poison in as Joffrey was cutting the pie. He took a drink and then cut pie. Olenna was right behind him on the dais.
187	MoIaF	2014-04-13	The word infidel has such a loaded meaning i cant even start. Its heavily linked with terrorists. I will stop complaining, but man, they may as well have had him talk about his "final solution" for westeros.

GRRM did write the episode I wonder why he choose to make the a changes he did.
188	Fool of a Book	2014-04-13	No one missed that scene - you could see that all the stones were still there.
Â 
Unless that was the reason they changed the stones to pale blue instead of deep purple, so we would miss the fact a stone was missing.


No, I saw that the necklace's stones extended under her fancy King's Landing style "hair did" so it wasn't obvious.
189	NightStark	2014-04-13	I understand why they changed most of the things, including Sir Illyn

190	Newstar	2014-04-13	There had better be some Purple Wedding Youtube reactions from Unsullied taped by their friends.
191	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-04-13	Â 
Wasn't it sort of the emotional equivalent of Arya chucking rocks at Nymeria to drive her off, though? I don't think he would have told her any of that unless he thought it was the only way to sever the relationship.


Â 
Oh I know. It's a pretty dark way of ending the relationship regardless.
192	Skywarpgold	2014-04-13	Then why did the poisoning take so long?Â 


Â 
I think it's simply because he didn't refill his wine until Tyrion did. There is definitely an audible "plink" in the episode as the QoT drops her hand though...
193	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-13	Also Olenna totally did it, come on. Tyrion grabbed the cup from in front of her. Even my mum figured it out.

Â 
Also, the actress who plays Shae is the most unconvincing at crying.Â 

Uuggghhhh i know! She cant even fake cry.
194	Nymeria's pup	2014-04-13	It looked to me like there was a stone missing from Sansa's necklace on her left side. Since it was on top of her dress it was hard to tell, but it looked like it was missing. Also was the dwarf that was playing Robb Stark actually Penny? I never saw a face and the voice sounded like a female imitating a male.
195	rmholt	2014-04-13	Â 
And actually, there's a HUGE audio clue: As the QoT walks by the main table after touching Sansa's necklace (there's also a quick scene of the necklace WITHOUT one of the gems, you can see the empty gem holder), she drops her hand, and you can hear a "plink" as she drops the gem into something (I think it was the wine bottle itself). It's rather subtle, I had to rewind to listen again.
Â 
EDIT: Grammar fixes.

Jeez and I was watching?! Have to review. What was that quick camera shot inside the pie right after Joffrey cut it? Looked like a dead pigeon.
196	Colonel Green	2014-04-13	Because we don't have the benefit of Tyrion's POV of the wedding where it's clear he has no involvement in what's happening, I think the show will clarify very quickly that Tyrion is innocent.


I can't imagine any show-only viewer thinking Tyrion was involved, considering how he's been characterized up to this point.
197	YourMomsBox	2014-04-13	I really liked the scenes at the Dreadfort. As our primary villain has now passed, they set it up well so that the Bolton's are now stepping into that role. Liked the little shoulder bump Ramsay gives to Locke. I also burst out laughing when Podrick realizes the whore being checked out by Oberyn is the same one he banged last season.
198	Lady of Dragonstone	2014-04-13	Also repeated image of the snow-covered throne room. Seems more clearly a literal prophecy than something symbolic, especially when paired with the vision of the dragon flying over KL.


I loved Bran's visions in this episode. The dragon over the city, the throne room... I hope we see a lot more of them, to be honest. I love the dream-like quality.
I am wondering what to make about some of the Shae/Tyrion tweaks, I think that's the only thing I super disliked about this episode. So after she leaves Tyrion's, she goes to the ship with Bronn where Varys is. I wonder in what manner will she get to the TotH: voluntarily or forced?
I did like the Melisandre and Shireen scene. I love TV!Shireen, I hope she keeps getting screentime.
Led to the conclusion based on the show that Bronn has turned, I think someone else mentioned that. It wouldn't surprise me if he was working for Varys.
Â 
Mace Tyrell!!!! And the sets!!! <3 This is the kind of stuff I've been waiting for
199	Nymeria's pup	2014-04-13	I do believe that was pigeon poop inside the pie.
200	The Wolves	2014-04-13	There had better be some Purple Wedding Youtube reactions from Unsullied taped by their friends.

I can't wait for the scene of Joffery dying on YouTube
201	Mya Stone	2014-04-13	Yeah, the makeup team outdid themselves with Joff's face. It was a thing of beauty.Â
202	Chebyshov	2014-04-13	Pretty sure the Oberyn/Cersei exchange was my favorite part when he talks about why Myrcella is better off in Dorne
203	Obebb	2014-04-13	Initial thoughts:
Â 
All that Roose and Ramsay and Reek stuff was awesome. I loved that scene. Even though Theon may not exactly look like Reek should, he is certainly acting like it! Also loved that Bran scene, the snow looked so beautiful for some reasonÂ   And very happy to see Meera again~Â  Â And that look Loras and Oberyn sharedÂ  Â  Â   Lovin' it.Â 
Â 
And Joffrey's face at the end. Oh god it was terrifying; perfect.
Â 
Time to watch again
204	Lord Godric	2014-04-13	It didn't take that long. The QoT slipped the poison in as Joffrey was cutting the pie. He took a drink and then cut pie. Olenna was right behind him on the dais.


The person to whom I was replying said that it was done immediately after she touched Sansa.Â
205	MoIaF	2014-04-13	Also, it was sad seeing Theon trying not to react to Robb's death.
206	Belisarius09	2014-04-13	Loved the purple wedding.Â  Although wish the necklace had been more "obvious"?
Â 
Nice character building on the Boltons, Reek, and three eyed crow.
Â 
BUT WHAT THE FUCK.Â  They have continued to Butcher Stannis... like wtf wow.Â  He burned them for TREASON, for making secret deals with the Lannisters, not for their religion.Â  WTF!!! Thats totally BS.Â  Stannis was never religious, he only uses Mel as a means to an end, he's never a believer himself.Â  WTF.Â  Fucking horrible.Â 
Â 
I think the thing that confuses me the most is that it was GRRM who wrote this episode.Â  Why would he change Stannis like that...

207	Stannis I	2014-04-13	Number 1 who knows, but number 2 she does. Just rewatch...the far right jewel is missing and you can see Olenna briefly touch it


Really? I'll have to see that again...
208	jons nissa	2014-04-13	It looked to me like there was a stone missing from Sansa's necklace on her left side. Since it was on top of her dress it was hard to tell, but it looked like it was missing.Â 


Â 
i was really staring hard at it but in the end, i wasn't sure. if i'm not sure and i know it's coming, how are the unsullied going to catch it?
209	rmholt	2014-04-13	GRRM did write the episode I wonder why he choose to make the a changes he did.

FFS I forgot he wrote it! Well kudos for the MHO improvements. Whew! Pedestal teetered a little
210	Newstar	2014-04-13	Someone on Twitter speculated that Oberyn was behind Dontos nabbing Sansa. LOL, if ONLY.
211	FNF	2014-04-13	GRRM did write the episode I wonder why he choose to make the a changes he did.


He has to roll with what D&D do, just like how he made Shae appear strong in this episode. He can't all of a sudden make Stannis appear unyielding when the show makes him dependant on Mel in every single matter. If GRRM kept the reason for executing a Florent as him betraying Stannis to the Lannisters, it would have been fine. Instead, he dun-goofed and made him into a religious zealot, like D&D do.
212	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-13	I am convinced the new queen put the poison in the cup after getting it from grandma.
Â 
His death scene was great And bonus? Something that actually happened.


I think the poison was added when margaery handed Ollena the cup while giving Joffrey the pie.
213	Colonel Green	2014-04-13	GRRM did write the episode I wonder why he choose to make the a changes he did.


The Stannis scenes were written by D&D for episode 1.

i was really staring hard at it but in the end, i wasn't sure. if i'm not sure and i know it's coming, how are the unsullied going to catch it?

I think they wanted it to be ambiguous, but is bet next episode Sansa is going to comment on a missing jewel
215	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-04-13	All 5 of the dwarf actors were male, so I wonder if this will change the future with Tyrion and the female.
216	Skywarpgold	2014-04-13	No, I saw that the necklace's stones extended under her fancy King's Landing style "hair did" so it wasn't obvious.


Â 
You can definitely see an empty stone clasp, on the far right of the necklace, in one of the closeups of Sansa after the QoT touches the necklace.
217	Mya Stone	2014-04-13	I do believe that was pigeon poop inside the pie.


Â 
I thought Joff slayed a dove, which is a bad omen...
218	rmholt	2014-04-13	I was ready to watch the episode and a friend fainted. FAINTED. In front of me... it was awful. By the time we got her home I only managed to see the end, when Joffrey started to choke.
Â 
It
Â 
Was
Â 
AWFUL.
Â 
Â 
which mean, it was AMAZING. Long live the cunt King.
Â 
And Jack Gleeson, you will be missed, kiddo. I've never felt so much joy hating someone.

Best post ever
219	Lord Godric	2014-04-13	Pretty sure the Oberyn/Cersei exchange was my favorite part when he talks about why Myrcella is better off in Dorne


It was a subtle threat and nicely done.Â
220	Syrio.Forel	2014-04-13	GRRM's episode was a bit of a misfire last season but this one was pretty great.Â  What a horribly uncomfortable wedding peppered in with some great character interaction and performances.
Â 
Very interesting they didn't have the reveal that Joffrey was behind the plot to kill Bran.Â  I actually wondered last year if they would reveal this as they had showed Joffrey being an even greater shit on the show that revealing the Bran thing would garner no real surprise.
Â 
Looks like we're seeing the birth of Batshit Crazy Cersei.Â  Not just the end with her father but her ability to make stupid decisions by deciding that the leftovers would go to the kennels instead of the poor.
Â 
Terrific performance by Peter Dinklage but I'm getting tired of the show portraying him as a total angel.
Â 
The Bolton interaction was shown and was a good look at how the minds of Roose and Ramsay function.Â  Of course Ramsay and Locke would get along just great.Â  Very interesting that the plotting against Jon is beginning now.Â  This storyline should be good this year.Â  Alfie Allen is handling the Reek stuff well.
Loved Loras burning Jaime with the "Neither will you!" line.
Â 
No dwarves on pigs but that "War of Five Kings" bit was brutal.
Â 
Sophie Turner didn't have much dialogue tonight but did a hell of a job with her non-verbal reactions.
Â 
Given the shows lack of subtlety, it was nice that they didn't give away who had poisoned Joffrey at all.Â  Next week's preview seems to imply that Maegarey didn't know about it after all.
Â 
Best of luck to Jack Gleeson.Â  He brought his best to the role tonight, showing Joffrey in all his degenerate "glory."


Nice. This is what I was looking for. Someone else who had a little more than one line to throw in. I apologize in advance if I start rambling since I'm sipping wine Cersei-style Feast of Crows time frame.
Â 
First off, I'm getting upset that the show is moving so fast (nvm the whole Arya-stabbing-Raf-in-the-throat-spoiler-the-show-did-before-the-book), but I actually liked this episode. Still think it's moving kinda fast, but.... oh well. (side note: DAMN! 14 NEW REPLIES WHILE I'M TYPING THIS!!! I'm gonna be up all night reading this thread).
Â 
Ok, 1) I didn't like the whole Reek-Ramsay POVs last season, but this episode was actually kinda cool (in my opinion), although I see the whole pink letter coming up WAY too quick.
Â 
2) Show Bronn is way more awesome than book Bronn, and I love book Bronn.
Â 
3) Tyrion breaking up with Shae. Shae is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO different from her book counterpart, it's ridiculous.
Â 
4) Up to 27 replies and I'm typing fast. This is ridiculous.
Â 
5) Did anyone else notice the scene with Oberyn saying "Hello..... Not you..." to Tyrion??? I'm loving the show Red Viper.
Â 
6) Purple wedding was actually cool BUT no word on Joff trying to kill Bran... dubz-tee-eff HBO?!?
Â 
7) I think I'm done, but all-in-all, this ep was cool. Wait... one more...
Â 
8) BRYNDEN RIVERS!!!
Â 
9) Just because it came up, 41 replies.... And might as well make it...
Â 
10) BRING BACK SYRIO FOREL!!!
221	Nymeria's pup	2014-04-13	As much as I hated Joff, I will miss Jack Gleeson. He is done acting now. He is so good I wish he would keep it up, but I totally respect his choice to leave it. He had an awesome death scene.
222	Lord Godric	2014-04-13	Â

I thought here never saw the one with the wolf's head ("Robb")'s face. And the voice sounded like it could have been a girl lowering her voice. Could be wrong though

236	Lady of Dragonstone	2014-04-13	Tommen looks well cast, he's a cute kid.
Â 
Also loved the Cersei and Oberyn showdown at the wedding. Two remaining badasses from a great generation. I like the foreshadowing about Myrcella, it reminds me how far we've gotten into the show now!
237	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-04-13	I thought here never saw the one with the wolf's head ("Robb")'s face. And the voice sounded like it could have been a girl lowering her voice. Could be wrong though


Â Possibly, although to me it looks and sounded like a man. It seems if they were going to bother putting Penny in that scene, then they would have shown her face. But hard to say for sure.
238	nara	2014-04-13	First of all, the power went out right before the start of the show.Â  Thank GOD for HBO GO and the backup battery on my modem and wireless router!
Â 


Was that Jack Gleeson singing The Rains of Castamere during the credits???


Kinda sounded like him.Â  That's what I thought too.Â  Would be really cool!
Â 


The stannis scene ruined the whole episode for me.
I cant possibly think of a more effective way to demonize a character.


I actually thought they made it clear that he felt forced to do things he didn't want to do.
Â 


Also can we please talk about that awkward moment with Cersei and Brienne??


I did love the scene of Jaime threatening Loras.Â  The ONLY good reason to have Jaime back so soon.Â  I also liked the confrontation between Cersei and Brienne.Â  Another good reason for Jaime to get her out of KL. I did think it strange that Brienne came up before anyone else did to congratulate the couple.Â  I think it would have been more realistic if others had come up first.
Â 
1.Â  I screamed out FAT WALDA when she appeared.Â  But was there a moment between her and Ramsay?Â  I wonder how that will play out/
2.Â  Didn't like the chick with Ramsay--the same one who helped him cut off Theon's penis.Â  I wanted to see Ramsay hunt the women.Â  I wish it had been someone that Theon used to sleep with like Kyra from the books.
3.Â  I don't mind Bronn replacing Ser Ilyn, but I teared up thinking of the actor's illness.Â  Anyone who his status?Â 
4.Â  Loved the War of the Five Kings.Â  Good change from the book, which I believe only had a couple of kings.Â  Really happy that Loras and Margaery were upset.Â  Finally, a reminder that Loras was genuinely in love with Renly!
5.Â  Hated Olenna's chat with Tywin and especially her calling him by his name instead of My Lord.
6.Â  I could not believe that Jaime would stand by while Joff humiliated Tyrion--but there was really no way around this since they brought him back early
7.Â  Sansa's expressions were PERFECT!Â  She has really developed well as an actress.
8.Â  I like the Shae/Tyrion scene--makes her upcoming betrayal (hopefully) more realistic.
9.Â  I hated Cersei's decision to give the foods to the dogs--was that in the book?
10.Â  I liked the Bolton/Ramsay scene, but was hoping for a "don't make me rue the day I raped your mother" line.Â  Not sure when that came in the books, but felt it could have fit it well.
11.Â  I really liked that Jaime and Cersei were both with Joff as he died.Â  Not sure why, but it seemed appropriate.Â  Great death scene by Jack Gleeson.Â  Will DEFINITELY MISS HIM.
239	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-04-13	Can someone please just screencap this already?


I can't do a screencap, but watching in slow-motion the QoT clearly plucks a stone (on Sansa's far left), palms it, and deposits it in the cup directly in front of Margaery as she returns to her seat (QoT has some mad slight-of-hand skills).
240	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-04-13	The Stannis scenes were written by D&D for episode 1.those bastards...

Imagine the uproar they would have if they made Stannis endorse Selyse's idea about beating Shireen.
Â
242	Ser Sourleaf	2014-04-13	As many times as I saw the season 4 previews, I never realized until this episode that the dragon shadow we see flying over a city, was flying over King's Landing! Â Bran's vision scene was immediately followed by the wedding scene, which showed the same aerial view of KL that we saw in Bran's vision.
243	Stannis I	2014-04-13	we are two brah... next time they ll play the star wars imperial march in his scenes.


Agreed. He's not an evil character at all and definitely not some R'hollor's Taliban. He's just a harsh man with iron fists.
244	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-04-13	The entire wedding was great. Loved the entire build-up to the final shot. Joffrey looked like a fucking zombie.
Â 
And darkside Tyrion discarding Shae. That's going to be ugly.
Â 
Wish people would cut it out with the 'whitewashing' of Tyrion bullshit. If he doesn't end up killing Shae, complain all you want, but at least wait until the damn episode airs before you start whining.

I partly agree. People complaining about the whitewashing is annoying. But speculating about if he will or won't is completely fine.
245	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-13	Â 
Imagine the uproar they would have if they made Stannis endorse Selyse's idea about beating Shireen.

Â 
Every time he called her the "former queen regent" I laughed.
Â 
I wasn't sure about the Cersei and Brienne scene but I guess it was okay. Brienne loves him! Jaime watching over them the entire time they're talking... is he curious or protective.. if so, of whom?
Â 
Sansa scenes in this episode gave me the feels...
247	Lord Godric	2014-04-13	I was really hoping Jaime would not just be an ass to Loras and invite him into the Kingsguard. Â But I think I'm the only person who cares that he isn't in a white cloak.Â

256	rmholt	2014-04-13	Loving the Spanish tweets. "Y SANSA AYUNDADO A TYRION. AY, MIS FEELS" ("And Sansa helping Tyrion. Oh, my feels"). 
Â 
There wasn't that moment from the books where Tyrion deliberately poured out the rest of the wine in the cup, was there?
Â 
Did Tommen even have one line?

It was sweet when he stopped laughing at the dwarfs at first when he noticed Tyrion and derped.  He'll get plenty of time and he's gotten even more adorable

259	ServantOnIce	2014-04-13	#StopbutcheringStannis


Â 
I agree. Even though GRRM wrote the episode, the Stannis burning his Brother In Law because he would not convert to R'hllor was foolish. The motive that Florent was a spy and planning on treason against Stannis is a lot more logical.
260	Jehanne	2014-04-13	I just rewatched the Sansa and Olenna scene at the wedding. You can actually see the gem in Olenna's hands when she takes it off the necklace. Then you do see the empty gem holder on the necklace, all the way to the right.
Â 
My question is....was the girl Ramsay, Miranda and Reek were hunting the same blonde thatÂ was in the Theon-Miranda sex scene right before Ramsay castrated Theon?
261	Boggsy Cyvasse	2014-04-13	Well Tyrion touches the cup and wine, Sansa touches the cup and the thorn in the Lions paw is sitting right next to the cup when Tyrion picks it up off the table to give to Joff. They make sure she is in the shot.
Now for a moment of silence to honor the legendary King Joffrey Baratheon first of his name, hero of the Black water, who single handedly defeated all five Kings without breaking a sweat, who exposed and Ned Stark for the treasonous bastard he was, who gave the evil Sansa a proper beating, the god king to whom the world bent the knee. His kind heart that gave Jobs to dwarves when no one else would, who fed the belligerent peasants with a firm hand and love instead of things like pretentious food, who took in a Queen who had lost her king and made her his wife, who out smarted Tyrion the stupid evil dwarf time and time again. The man the myth the modern day warrior King Joffrey Baratheon who may now rule the seven heavens as he once ruled the seven kingdoms.


Now THAT'S a spin!
262	NightStark	2014-04-13	Yeah, when will Loras join the kingsguard??


Never, they've established him as Mace's only son.
263	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-04-13	I liked the death scene, but the episode was a little underwhelming for me tbh. The premiere was better throughout. Also, is Balon Greyjoy still alive in the show? I can't remember them mentioning it yet. Funny because he dies before Robb and Joffrey in the book.
264	Chebyshov	2014-04-13	Screenshot of Olenna touching the jewel: http://i.imgur.com/bOZ4izP.jpg?1
This happens in between her touching her hair, so it's definitely subtle
265	jbent87	2014-04-13	I'm actually really glad that they are revealing Ramsay in all his sadistic, evil, people-hunting glory in the same episode as killing Joffrey. It's kind of like passing the psychopathic torch.

great call

No, she's just Myranda, a random evil chick.

Hmm...okay. Â I'll take it.Â
269	LifeRuiner	2014-04-13	I was really hoping Jaime would not just be an ass to Loras and invite him into the Kingsguard. Â But I think I'm the only person who cares that he isn't in a white cloak.Â 


Â 
You're not the only one. Their budding book relationship was more complex and interesting than what we have now.Â
270	rmholt	2014-04-13	I can't decide. Obviously she didn't get on the boat, so has Bronn turned at this point?

She's gone. She hasn't been Book Shae ever. MHO.
271	Fool of a Book	2014-04-13	Loras' dickstomp in Jaime's general direction wasÂ awesome.


"You won't marry her..."

273	Chebyshov	2014-04-13	No, she's just Myranda, a random evil chick.

Maybe she'll become a more empowered FAyra. I doubt it though...wondering her purpose
274	Jehanne	2014-04-13	No, she's just Myranda, a random evil chick.

I think these two chicks wereÂ  both in the scene right before Ramsay castrated Theon.

Top right, by Olenna's sleeve.
276	NightStark	2014-04-13	i'm not seeing the missing jewel


Far right, you can see the empty holder that clamps the top of the jewel.
277	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-04-13	Â 
I agree. Even though GRRM wrote the episode, the Stannis burning his Brother In Law because he would not convert to R'hllor was foolish. The motive that Florent was a spy and planning on treason against Stannis is a lot more logical.a burning that was not to cast a good wind to set sails or whatever...
He then quietly has supper. "the wall?...yeah...Im coming"
278	Stannis I	2014-04-13	And his female accomplice Myranda Royce? Â Did I catch that correctly?


I don't think so. She may have the same name, but why would she be someone from the Vale?
279	Colonel Green	2014-04-13	I think these two chicks wereÂ  both in the scene right before Ramsay castrated Theon.


Myranda was, but the blonde girl wasn't.
280	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-13	TV Shireen, I nominate thee for Queen of Westeros.
You take none of Mel's ****, and that is awesome.


Yiss. <3 Shireen forever
Â 


And his female accomplice Myranda Royce? Â Did I catch that correctly?


No, it was Myranda the Random Dreadette.
Â 


"You won't marry her..."
Â 
"Neither will you!" Â *FLOUNCE*

281	VeturKemur	2014-04-13	Kinda sounded like him.Â  That's what I thought too.Â  Would be really cool!


Â 
Guys, we've know about Sigur RA3s covering the song for weeks. You can listen to the full version here. It's pretty cool.
282	Strong Belwas!	2014-04-13	Far right, you can see the empty holder that clamps the top of the jewel.


ok,  don't know how i missed that
283	Doloorous Edd cracks me up	2014-04-13	I thought here never saw the one with the wolf's head ("Robb")'s face. And the voice sounded like it could have been a girl lowering her voice. Could be wrong though


Never saw the wolves face. I believe that is penny.
284	CyberKlown28	2014-04-13	I liked the death scene, but the episode was a little underwhelming for me tbh. The premiere was better throughout. Also, is Balon Greyjoy still alive in the show? I can't remember them mentioning it yet. Funny because he dies before Robb and Joffrey in the book.


Â 
Yes he is still alive!
Season 3's finale, they got Theon's manhood in the box, then the sister did the random 'I'm going to save him!!!!' thing(yeah 50 man ship vs. The Dreadfort).
285	Colonel Green	2014-04-13	I will say, it was nice that after a season plus of being a joke, Loras got to have the last laugh in his exchange with Jaime.
286	Newstar	2014-04-13	Some other moments I liked:
Â 
Jaime and Cersei being the only ones to rush to help Joffrey.
Â 
"NEITHER WILL YOU." GRRM writes the sassiest dialogue.
Â 
Tyrion putting his hand over Sansa's during the dwarf entertainment. Blah blah blah whitewashing, Book Tyrion was too far up his own ass to do anything of the sort, I know, I know. I still liked it.

293	Lady Olenna	2014-04-13	I < 3 Olenna. 
Best part of the episode was the Oberyn - Loras gaze, along with the Brienne - Jaime eye lock. 
Pycelle is such a dirty old fart. 
And we finally see Varys! 
The very saddening aspect of this episode is that we will no longer be graced with Jack's immense talent. He's said he's done with acting after this show, which is disappointing because he really, really nailed Joffrey like no one else could
294	King Zee	2014-04-13	Â 
My question is....was the girl Ramsay, Miranda and Reek were hunting the same blonde thatÂ was in the Theon-Miranda sex scene right before Ramsay castrated Theon?


I dont think it was the same actress but I do think it was meant to be the same character.
295	Stannis I	2014-04-13	Â

Â 
For anyone still looking for it, the empty slot is the rightmost one - against her dress.Â  It's not any of the stones against her skin, which makes it harder to see.
298	Tyrion Lannister	2014-04-13	Talk about horrible timing! Â After Joffrey sliced the pie, the power flickered for a second...long enough to knock out the cable, of course. Â By the time it came back, Joffrey was dead! Â I watch with a show-only person, who about ten minutes earlier said he was praying Joffrey's wedding went as well for him as the RW did for the Starks. Â The stupid storm deprived him of that moment.
Â 
I liked Oberyn's scene with the Lannisters, and his little mention of Myrcella. Â That guy is awesome, and will be taken from us far too soon for my liking. Â We got a lot more of Jack Gleeson, but I'll miss him anyhow. Â He somehow got me to hate Joffrey at least as much as I did in the books, if not more. Â Great bit of casting and acting with him.
299	Ser Sourleaf	2014-04-13	Did anyone else catch a close up of Lord Eddard in Bran's vision?;
300	Syrio.Forel	2014-04-13	Â 
My impression was that Shae would go scorched earth on Tyrion for revenge.
Â 
Oooh, though, I really like Chebyshov's idea that Bronn is already bought off and is already lying to Tyrion about Shae. Nice.
Â 
Also liked Oberyn reminding Cersei that Myrcella was effectively the Martells' hostage and subtly threatening Myrcella's safety. Well done.


If they went that route, I guess Bronn's betrayal would hurt more than Shae's (that's me personally, tho), but the whole Oberyn-Ellaria-Cersei-Tywin exchange..... Best scene in the whole episode, IMO.

i agree on the Joffrey part. He was a fantastic villain. I am sure they will start building up Ramsay and Roose to take his place. Jooffrey was such an easy character to hate.
304	Syrio.Forel	2014-04-13	He died, aye


Best. Comment. Ever.Â  (Too bad you all can't see what he was replying to)
305	nara	2014-04-13	Â 
My guess is Varys, Bronn mentions Varys in the scene, I think.
Â 
I really disliked this. Â Back to Shae Superwoman Whore. Â She loves Tyrion and WTF? He thinks it's better to tell her he wants her to leave because she's a whore instead of to save her life? Â When did he get this stupid?


Â 
Â 


Â 
I thought it was extremely stupid, and she isn't that dumb in the show. Â My sister and father will kill you, so you have to get on the boat, end of discussion is much more sensible than what they did.


Â 
I actually thought it worked because Tyrion told Varys that he had warned her several times and she wouldn't listen.Â 
Â 
Also, there are some who theorize that Shae was always Tywin's pawn/whore--because Bronn stole her from someone else in Tywin's camp and it's never mentioned who that was.Â  (Not sure where I stand on this) Anyway, if that's true, she might think that she has nothing to fear from Tywin.
Â 


I also found it interesting that Bran is starting to get visions. Â In the first season the producers were so strongly against giving him dreams, for whatever reasons, but it looks like they can no longer avoid it. Â Snow on the throne, dragons over King's Landing. Â Interesting stuff.Â 


Â 
Yes, loved the visions!Â  Need to rewatch and analyze.Â  Was anyone else reminded of the movie, The Ring, during those visions?
Â 


I was ready to watch the episode and a friend fainted. FAINTED. In front of me... it was awful. By the time we got her home I only managed to see the end, when Joffrey started to choke.
Â 


How is your friend doing?Â  Was it show-related anxiety or something else?
Â 
Â 
Forgot to mention early, Theon was AWESOME.Â  I was really pleased with his reaction to hearing about Robb's death.Â  He had to hide it from Ramsay, but I was VERY glad to see the emotion there.Â  I didn't feel we got enough of it from Jon last week and Sansa in last season's finale due to the way the scenes were written.Â

Â 
I do hope the show keeps Book Jaime's "Joffrey was a little shit and deserves to die" attitude.Â  Normally that kind of attitude would annoy me but I think everyone would understand if the son in question was Joffrey.
313	nara	2014-04-13	All 5 of the dwarf actors were male, so I wonder if this will change the future with Tyrion and the female.


Penny can still be the sister of one of those dwarves, even if she wasn't in the skit herself
314	NightStark	2014-04-13	Was it Eddard or BR?


There were scenes of Ned sharpening Ice and a shot of him in the Black cells.
315	FNF	2014-04-13	For all the Penny haters....you do know that nothing prevents Penny from being off screen Â at the Wedding. Later she can simply say she used to help her brother put on his costume.


I don't see what she can contribute to the show. I'm 99% sure she's cut.
316	King Zee	2014-04-13	apparantly everyone missed Varys saying that if confronted about Shae by Tywin, he would not lie.
317	go joff go	2014-04-13	I think the shae set up is obvious.  Bronn and Shae never went to the ship. I watched season 2 again and the scene where bronn brings shae to tyrion he asks where he got her. He say some prick two tents down. He was talking about tywin. It was a setup since season two. It's who shae was waiting to during Blackwater.  There is now no chance that Tyson kills her

Â That's true. They probably just didn't want to cast the roll this early, since she really won't come in to play until maybe mid season 5.
320	Newstar	2014-04-13	Diana Rigg's hilariously unconvincing "Someone help the poor boy!" was great.

333	Raksha 2014	2014-04-13	As much as I hated Joff, I will miss Jack Gleeson. He is done acting now. He is so good I wish he would keep it up, but I totally respect his choice to leave it. He had an awesome death scene.


Â 
Â 
That young man did an outstanding job. Â He could have made Joffrey a one-note character; but he did develop him, from an insecure boy to a king who has become dangerously, uncontrollably, vicious to almost everyone. Â His acting tonight, especially the scenes with Joffrey, were excellent as well. Â
334	boojam	2014-04-13	I didn't know they would condense the Sansa-Dontos deal that much.Are they gonna wait till dark?

After the QoT says something like "I have to return to my seat and eat some of this food I bought", they pan wide to show the whole dais, and she walks in front of Margery and Joffrey - it looks like she might drop something in the cup at the points...but it's so far panned out, it's pretty hard to see.
337	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-13	I haven't yet seen the episode but after reading all the StanFans' pain, maybe what they plan is to make him a villain or a dislikeable character so, at the end, when he actually saves the day, people is confused as fuck? Pretty much the Unsullied will have the same discussions we have here about Dany and the slavers, but instead, Stannis and the people who he got burnt.
Â 
Â

It's not a case of what else happens in the episode. It's more down to the fact that the PW portrays Balon as dead and buried when we know fine well that in the show he isn't at this point. If these scenes were filmed far apart, any change to the script and any minor mistake (like this) could have went unchecked. That's my opinion on the matter anyway. You can chalk it down to forshadowing or w/e if you want, but why distinctly mention dwarves in your reply? I can't help but feel that was some sort of veiled insult- suggesting i'm somehow prejudice against dwarves?
347	Gran de Lys	2014-04-13	I have no problem with Dwarf!Balon saying, "I'm drowning!" It is known (heh) that those salty Iron Islanders have a Drowned God and a thing for all things watery. Not sure why Mel's prophesies are playing out in the wrong order, though.Â
348	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-13	I think it will be offscreen. Otherwise they must show someone pushing him, which would take half the fun of it.


Heh i hope so. We have to have the Unsullied version of the Banana Peel.Â 
Â 


I liked that Sansa's expression seemed to indicate that she understood that Ice was now Joff's new toy 
Her ice cold stares were marvelous, as were the ever so tender moments between her and Tyrion.


Yes. Sophie has very little lines but her non-verbal acting was beautiful. <3
Â 


Yeah, that was add to. Theon never told anyone about it. So, I'm guessing, they'll remove the whole part of the fake Arya.


Oh i dont think they will. I hope not anyway cuz i find that plot fascinating. Plus it reveals how depraved the Boltons and Littlefinger are.
349	Castel	2014-04-13	Good episode. Beyond the Shae bullshit that is but then, that's been around for a while, like a bad smell you grudgingly get used to.

350	HrafntA1r	2014-04-13	For people who don't like Cersei's "feed the leftovers to the poor" intervention: I thought it was deliberate and playing with the pie-theorists (i.e. the people who think Joffrey was poisoned by the pie), since it suggested that maybe Cersei might have poisoned her own son, which would play with her instantaneous move of pointing a finger at Tyrion right after Joffrey dies.Â  Just a thought.
351	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-04-13	Little thing that I didnt like: It seams its Tywin the fool who doesnt pay the IB debt and not cersei. A dumb move not alike Tywin probably to rush Stannis loan.
352	boojam	2014-04-13	This is awesome! However I cant fin the moment where it goes in the cup. Was that offscreen?Unless someone knows different it's 'off screen' in the book too.
353	lostinwesteros	2014-04-13	Damn!  Thought I'd never catch up with this thread!  
Loved the Bran and - da da -  Bloodraven scene.  
It's kind of a shame Sansa and Tyrion are now parted, just when their empathy is building.  Great to see people's expressions as Joff's psychopathic behavior escalated.
Liked the brotherly scene with Tyrion and Jaime.  Sad to see Theon struggle with his emotions when learning of Robb's death.  I see Cersei is honing her bitch skills, but I did enjoy the scene with Pycelle.
354	Chebyshov	2014-04-13	It's going to be tough to cap - as the QoT is walking away from Sansa, you can see her bend her right arm in front of Margaery and you hear a "clink".

Just caught it, thanks! That's incredibly subtle. Also some slow-moving poison, unless Margery didn't slip it in until after the pie was brought out
355	l2 0 5 5	2014-04-13	Loved the purple wedding.Â  Although wish the necklace had been more "obvious"?
Â 
Nice character building on the Boltons, Reek, and three eyed crow.
Â 
BUT WHAT THE FUCK.Â  They have continued to Butcher Stannis... like wtf wow.Â  He burned them for TREASON, for making secret deals with the Lannisters, not for their religion.Â  WTF!!! Thats totally BS.Â  Stannis was never religious, he only uses Mel as a means to an end, he's never a believer himself.Â  WTF.Â  Fucking horrible.Â 
Â 
I think the thing that confuses me the most is that it was GRRM who wrote this episode.Â  Why would he change Stannis like that...


I agree with the Stannis comment. Â Didn't even get Alester's title right. Â No one to blame here but GRRm since he wrote the episode right? Small thing to complain about. Â The Bolton/Reek relationship was great.
356	Darth Pipes	2014-04-13	For people who don't like Cersei's "feed the leftovers to the poor" intervention: I thought it was deliberate and playing with the pie-theorists (i.e. the people who think Joffrey was poisoned by the pie), since it suggested that maybe Cersei might have poisoned her own son, which would play with her instantaneous move of pointing a finger at Tyrion right after Joffrey dies.Â  Just a thought.


Â 
I don't see a problem with that.Â  I thought it was a nod to the books where we see Cersei make these stupid and horrible decisions over petty slights, anger and jealousies.Â  That was closer to Book Cersei than we've seen for a while.
357	Stannis I	2014-04-13	I have no problem with Dwarf!Balon saying, "I'm drowning!" It is known (heh) that those salty Iron Islanders have a Drowned God and a thing for all things watery. Not sure why Mel's prophesies are playing out in the wrong order, though.Â 


Not the point. The point is: if Balon is alive, how could Joffrey claim he defeated him?Â
358	Cas Stark	2014-04-13	For people who don't like Cersei's "feed the leftovers to the poor" intervention: I thought it was deliberate and playing with the pie-theorists (i.e. the people who think Joffrey was poisoned by the pie), since it suggested that maybe Cersei might have poisoned her own son, which would play with her instantaneous move of pointing a finger at Tyrion right after Joffrey dies.Â  Just a thought.


Â 
I've never heard the pie theory, which seems crackpotish to me....I just thought it showed us some of Book Cersei--complete stupidity, counter productive move because it was someone else giving an order instead of her.
359	Newstar	2014-04-13	I know that writers now avoid this line because of the Terminator reference, but I really, really wish Dontos had actually said "Come with me if you want to live" instead of whatever variation on that he used.
360	Syrio.Forel	2014-04-13	Well Tyrion touches the cup and wine, Sansa touches the cup and the thorn in the Lions paw is sitting right next to the cup when Tyrion picks it up off the table to give to Joff. They make sure she is in the shot.
Now for a moment of silence to honor the legendary King Joffrey Baratheon first of his name, hero of the Black water, who single handedly defeated all five Kings without breaking a sweat, who exposed and Ned Stark for the treasonous bastard he was, who gave the evil Sansa a proper beating, the god king to whom the world bent the knee. His kind heart that gave Jobs to dwarves when no one else would, who fed the belligerent peasants with a firm hand and love instead of things like pretentious food, who took in a Queen who had lost her king and made her his wife, who out smarted Tyrion the stupid evil dwarf time and time again. The man the myth the modern day warrior King Joffrey Baratheon who may now rule the seven heavens as he once ruled the seven kingdoms.


FINALLY!!!! Someone who sees it how it really was! I feel this is what GRRM was really going for but ppl were so caught up in the whole, "gotta take the North from the Starks while I have a chance" that they forgot... wait... did u say Joffrey or Balon??
361	Fool of a Book	2014-04-13	Shhh repeat is back on

Â 
Â 
I've always thought that Tywin must have secretly been quite relieved that Joffrey was dead. Â Joffrey grown into adulthood with total power was a scary prospect; Joffrey would have had no qualms about killing Lannisters, including Tywin himself.
363	pantouflas	2014-04-13	&nbsp;
This was the single best episode of the series to date. Masterpiece

I thought he said exactly that.
Â 
On-topic: Great episode! Some nitpicks though:
Â 
1) Not enough Sansa. Though her non-verbal scenes were great. I wished she had mentioned about Ice to Tyrion, though I hate her talking anything with Tyrion.
Â 
2) I don't understand Margaery 'Princess of the People' Tyrell. Just seems anachronistic.
Â 
All in all, great episode. Dianna Rigg and Jack Gleeson killed it, and was that dragons in King's Landing? Might we now know something about TWOW?
369	Salad Days Saan	2014-04-13	FAT WALDA~!
Â 
MACE~!
Â 
Well, now we know how/why Locke is going to The Wall.Â  Looks like he'll be taking over the undercover/mole among the crows role instead of a King's Landing Agent.Â  Locke and Ramsay acting like BFF's and Ramsay being truly happy/congratulatory to Locke for unhanding Jaime was a nice little nugget.Â  And oh, Myranda, ignorance is bliss.Â  Hunting your ex-tag team partner through the woods, as though this is the first -- or LAST -- time that's happening.
Â 
Papa Bolton is Not Amused with Ramsay.Â  And so it begins.... 
Â 
[Ramsay trolling Reek about Robb was glorious.]
Â 
Is Tywin and Olenna hanging out canon?Â  No.Â  Is Charles Dance and Diana Rigg doing a scene together so awesome that I don't care?Â  YES.Â  Love her shutdown of Lord Oaf (it's the only time we hear his name, too).
Â 
Sorry Bran, your scene was merely Very Good this week, which means it's the low point when everything else is Pants Shittingly Awesome (and Dany takes the week off).
Â 
Shireen:Â  still adorable.Â  And she's not afraid of Melisandre.Â  You Go Girl.
Â 
Queen Selyse:Â  Still Bugfuck Crazy, never change.
Â 
Stannis The Mannis:Â  can even take a seagull dinner and leave folks saying WIE ROMANTISCHE.
Â 
Was not initially a fan of Loras moving on and not being "the sun has set no candle can replace it".Â  However, trading bedroom eyes with Oberyn?Â Â  I *knew* the Tyrells and Martells didn't really hate each other Â  And besides, Loras is a pastiche of all three book brothers.Â  Bit of Willas coming out there.Â  Also loved Loras spilling that burnsauce on Jaime.Â  About time we saw Loras show off some of his cockiness and his spine.Â  Loras ain't afraid of no kingslayer.
Â 
Jaime's secret is safe with Bronn.Â  But not because of Tyrion.Â  Given his account of Shae's departure, I think The Imp has been outbid for his services.Â  And/or it's time to remember that Tyrion's money is ultimately really his dad's money.
Â 
"In some parts of the kingdom bastards are shunned.Â  In other parts, the murder of children and the raping of their mother are considered somewhat distasteful.Â  It's a good thing your daughter is in the latter sort of place."Â  XD XD XD XD XD XD XD XD XD XD Love Oberyn so much.Â  And people doubted Pedro Pascal when the casting was first announced.Â 
Â 
Brienne and Pycelle learn that Cersei is literally incapable of not being a complete raging bitch for more than a minute.Â  Lena is amazing.
Â 
Show's Dwarf Joust > Book's Dwarf Joust.Â  That was some pro-wrestling heel level shit from the wrestling heel counterpart on the show, King Joffrey.Â  Midgets dressed as your rivals and behaving like jackasses and getting squashed.Â  Renly "taking it in the ass", Stannis being portrayed as a total pussy taking one arrow and running, and Robb saying "I'm the king in the north" in a slow drawl over and over again before getting his wolf-head knocked off.Â  Didn't notice anything about Balon but I'm sure it was in spirit.Â  Loved Loras storming out in rage at the offensive portrayal of Renly (squealing as he was repeatedly stabbed in the butt).Â  Was hopeful Sansa would deduce where the Valyrian Steel came from and give the line about "what did they do to my father's sword?" BUT Sophie had the dead-stare working overtime.
Â 
And then we have the money shot.
Â 
'Twas glorious.Â  Everything I hoped for, everything I saw in my mind's eye in the years since first reading the book.Â  A Golden Crown.Â  Dracarys.Â  These are the "money shot" scenes I've been anticipating most since this show came to air.Â  And once again Game Of Thrones hits it out of the park.Â  Jack Gleeson retires a champion.Â  Can't remember Maester Cressen's death from season 2 so I don't know if they repeated the symptoms, but this was wonderfully bloody and I love how ONLY Jaime and Cersei run to the king's side.
Â 
Horrified reaction shots during the wedding of everyone else at Joffrey's outrageous behavior.Â  Loras storming out, WTF looks from Mace and Olenna, Margaery looking to see how Sansa reacts to the worst stuff, even Tywin looks unhappy.Â  Only Cersei is amused by this parade of offensiveness.Â  And thus while Tyrion is arrested immediately, the show has effectively set up what I hoped they would, a "who shot JR?" style mystery and cliffhanger over who REALLY did it.Â  Already the reaction from the Unsullied is entertaining me as they speculate wildly (and even cleverly, sometimes.Â  One show only fan that I saw has already fingered Olenna, though they did not notice the significance of her fucking with Sansa's necklace).Â  The early leading culprit is actually Dontos, as his reappearance in the show seemingly "makes no sense" unless it's to set him up for this.Â  And of course he smuggles Sansa to safety at just the right time.Â  My favorite (somewhat joking) guess so far is that everybody wanted Joffrey dead and gave him a slow acting poison that would take days, but because so many people. were independently trying to poison him he O.D.ed and died immediately.Â  Sansa, Dontos, Oberyn and his suspicious nickname, Margaery, and Olenna have all been fingered; Tyrion being accused of it, of course, eliminates him in people's minds as a potential Real Killer.
Â 
And now I need a cigarette (even though I don't smoke)

The dwarfs were the ones re-enacting the winning of the war, and one of them said he was drowning. No offense meant

I love it.
374	pantouflas	2014-04-13	Did anyone notice if, during QoT and Tywin's chat, they said anything that might be re-construed as planning this together? I know this is crackpot, but Tywin seems awfully passive during the whole wedding...
I wouldn't mind seeing a breakdown of Bran's vision too. Did it include the Snowy Throne Room from Dani's vision back in Series 2, or were my eyes playing tricks on me?

He's going to knock over the goblet of wine!" and then he did and I burst out laughing so much I had to pause it. My husband (non-bookreader) just looked at me like I was crazy.

Â 
Didn't D&D eliminate Ros because the actress didn't want to do anymore nude scenes?Â  At least, that was the rumor.Â  Perhaps she is the new "random woman we can show nude and act as though that's part of the plot."Â  Giving her a role as Ramsay's henchwoman might be a set up for that...


Â 
She's ok now. Paramedics got her home with her family. Apparently, she wasn't eating very well these days.


Glad to hear it.Â  I hope she stays healthy.
Â 
Â 
Also, am I the only one unhappy that apparently Selyse and Stannis were already married during the siege of Storm's End?Â  It doesn't really matter since they already got rid of Edric Storm in the show, but I always liked how angry Stannis was that Robert bedded their cousin in his marriage bed and caused him not to have sons.

When Ramsay was posing as Reek in Winterfell, he killed the miller's boys and convinced Theon to pass them for Bran and Rickon.

Ramsay was the one who killed the miller's sons in the books, so he knows they weren't Bran & Rickon.
And in the show Theon did tell Ramsay that he never found the Stark boys.
379	Newstar	2014-04-13	Show's Dwarf Joust > Book's Dwarf Joust.Â  That was some pro-wrestling heel level shit from the wrestling heel counterpart on the show,

Yes, although I guess you could say that the TV joust was offensive to everyone in so many ways, whereas the book joust was more pointedly offensive to Tyrion. It was definitely an improvement on the books, though.

380	rmholt	2014-04-13	I don't recall that... Theon never tells that, if I'm not mistaken. He even thinks he's clever for that.

Book Theon has to have Ramsay shove a sackful of clothes including a wolf pin into his hands to get the concept. Ramsey knew the whole story and Roose totally pwns Ramsey. And all his men.
381	MyLittleDirewolf	2014-04-13	If they went that route, I guess Bronn's betrayal would hurt more than Shae's (that's me personally, tho), but the whole Oberyn-Ellaria-Cersei-Tywin exchange..... Best scene in the whole episode, IMO.


I never thought that Bronn betrayed Tyrion. Tyrion asked Bronn to be his champion. Bronn was like "Dude, you pay me well, and you're cool and all, but that's the fucking Mountain. I'd die." and Tyrion basically is like well, thought I'd ask and doesn't seem to see it as a betrayal. Later when Bronn messes with them and names the baby Tyrion, I took that as a sign that he's still on Tyrion's side.
So, IDK what to make of the show changes here. If they have Bronn outright betray Tyrion, I'll be annoyed. I do wonder if Tywin got a hold of Shae, he could have nabbed her on the ship. Or what Varys's role in all this is, if he never was going to help her get to Pentos.
382	Newstar	2014-04-13	It seems to have been lost in all the discussions about Joffrey and the PW, but Alfie Allen gave good Reek in this episode.
Â 
...although I cackled at the transition from Theon shuddering to Tyrion digging into a long sausage. Never gets old. 
Â 
Although I liked the Tyrion/Jaime scene and the Jaime stuff in Episode 1, I really missed Jaime and Tyrion seeing each others' injuries. (I guess "handless and noseless" doesn't really work when Tyrion still has his nose, though.)

383	Rockroi	2014-04-13	The episode many have been waiting for for a long time (at least since Joff rode into Winterfell in the Pilot).
Â 
What I Liked:
Â 
An Heir of Desperation: Stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099> situation growing more and more precarious was well documented and the dialog between Selyse and Stannis was very good.Â  Again, when Stannis is given some breath to grow, the writing tends to be very good.Â  His decency does tend to leak out (and I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t think itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a coincidence that this episode was written by Martin, who has a far far far more balanced hand with Stannis than D&D).Â  Stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099> commitment is as severe as its ever been.Â  Butâ<U+0080>¦ wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t he supposed to go North?Â 
Â 
Stark, Raving Visions: Branâ<U+0080><U+0099>s dip into the pool of the Supernatural- complete with visions similar to Dany- was very well thought out and executed.Â  Â For a quick scene, it reminded us all of the scope of this work.
Â 
A Bolton in the Snow: The strident terror of the New North was played perfectly with the cold, calculating and brutal Roose Bolton holding court over the reptilian Locke, the psychotic Ramsey and the meek Reek.Â  I thought that the show did a great job of encapsulating Reekâ<U+0080><U+0099>s demise and how pliable he is now to Ramsey.Â  It also captured perfectly the high tension and shear terror that is the North now without Starks.Â  Also, that Reek told Ramsey about the truth of the Stark boys.
Â 
The Dwarf and the Cripple: So, buried deep in this episode was the new discovery of Jaime and Tyrion, characters who have not shared a screen since the pilot.Â  Jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s training combined was great, but even better was that possibly for the first time in their relationship, it was TYRION who had to make JAIME feel safe and Jaime who had to admit to a physical limitation.Â  The complexity of that relationship was tremendous.Â 
Andâ<U+0080>¦
Â 
I have a theory.Â 
Â 
I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t think Shae is an accident.Â  I think Tywin planted Shae; I think Tywin planted Shae and paid Bronn to bring him to Tyrion so that Shae could keep tabs on Tyrion for Tywin.Â  At first, this was only for the time they were in the camp, but as time went onâ<U+0080>¦ wellâ<U+0080>¦ if you are going to make a man Hand, might as well have a tail on him.Â  This explains Shaeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s strange pedigree; Â this explains her constant complaints (gets more info from Tyrion), and it it explains her reluctance to leave.Â 
This will also explain her strange rediscovery in a few episodes.Â 
Â 
Thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s my theory.Â 
Â 
Purple People Eaters: Â Everything about the wedding was tremendous; the dialog between the players, the development of the murder, Joffâ<U+0080><U+0099>s insanity, Brienneâ<U+0080><U+0099>s silent admission that she does love Jaime (and who can blame her), the dwarf war.Â Â  95% of the wedding was absolutely perfect, but the actual murder itself was special.Â  Joffâ<U+0080><U+0099>s death was about as well done as can be (even Jaimeâ<U+0080>¦ calling him â<U+0080><U+009C>Jofferyâ<U+0080><U+009D> not â<U+0080><U+009C>Your Graceâ<U+0080><U+009D> at the critical moment).Â  Joffâ<U+0080><U+0099>s death was raw, real, terrifying, horrible and in many ways far worse than Robbâ<U+0080><U+0099>s or Nedâ<U+0080><U+0099>s.Â  It captured the terror of his end moments.Â  Many people have wanted Joff dead for so long and in many ways this was as good as they could have hoped.Â 
Â 
What I am On the Fence On:
Â 
MY Son is Deadâ<U+0080>¦ I wonder What is on TV Later: In the book, Cerseiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s scream is the defining characteristic of JOffâ<U+0080><U+0099>s murder.Â  Her wail, her shear anguish over the death of her son is spectacular and sad- the fact that the reader can actually feel sorry for the Queen of Madness was a triumph of writing and of the readerâ<U+0080><U+0099>s ability to empathize even with the horribles of the world.Â  Â The show?Â  Cersei seemed upsetâ<U+0080>¦ I mean for a second or two- her son ded, but it was almost as if the director told her, â<U+0080><U+009C>Look, Leena, babe- donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t dwell on itâ<U+0080>¦ I mean, you have TWO other kids, MIRITE?!?!â<U+0080><U+009D> CErseiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s reaction to her sonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s murder was pedestrian, sloppy and cheap.Â  Yeah, she has the ANGER down pat, but her anguish was stilted, quick and brief.Â 
Â 
What IÂ didn'tÂ Like:
Â 
Remember that Time In the Book Where they Tried to Kill Bran â<U+0080>¦. Neither did the Show!!!Â  So, last week, I postulated that on eof the best parts of the book was when Tyrion finally pieced together that JOff ordered Bran killed.Â  In the books, itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a big moment because it 1) shows us Tyrionâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Brilliance, 2) gives payoff to the audience for solving a mystery and 3) fulfills a promise to the audience that even long-passed mysteries WILL be solved.Â  Here?Â  Nah!!!!!Â  Who needs conectivityu of story and a description of past events by revealing the truths in the present?Â  Thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s for losers!Â  Who cares about solving problems and answering questions- HERE MORE BOOBIES!!!Â 
Â 
Look, I am readily and happily WITHDRAW this criticism if JOffâ<U+0080><U+0099>s culpability is revealed in short order (I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t want to wait until the end of episode 40 to find out about an attempted murder in episode 2).Â  But, if its not and if D&D just let that juicy morsel â<U+0080><U+009C>die on the vineâ<U+0080><U+009D> and convince us that Cersei ordered it â<U+0080>¦ wellâ<U+0080>¦Â  I got one word for that:
Â 
Fail.Â 
Â 
Overall, a classic episode in a long sea of classics.Â  Great success.Â
384	rmholt	2014-04-13	Not the point. The point is: if Balon is alive, how could Joffrey claim he defeated him?Â 

Well I don't know. Edmure and Blackfish are alive so I guess Frey lost that one. :/
385	Knight of Ashes	2014-04-13	For a while there in Season 1, I thought they were writing a somewhat smarter version of Joffrey. His line there in an ep of Season 2 , "We're at war, nobody's safe" seem to bear this out and I thought he suspected who his true father is 'cause of the expression on his face when Tyrion, in the heat of the moment, told him he owed "you're Uncle Jaime" a lot. Oh well.....
ETA
There are times when Stannis looks like Alaister Sim playing Scrooge.

387	jmondrag	2014-04-13	If you look at like 32.55 it seems as if there is a jewel missing from Sansa's necklace. Either that, or the jewel looks like it's tucked under here dress, but I think that's the one that is supposed to be missing.
388	The Abominable SnowOther	2014-04-13	eek watching now
389	Salad Days Saan	2014-04-13	Oh, further Unsullied speculation on whodunnit:
Â 
a few people already suspect THE PIE, not the wine, was poison, since Joffrey was the only one who ate pie.
Â 
Given how often people on here have suspected the pie was poisoned instead/as well, I thought that was interesting to see.
Â 
I have a long week of reading reaction threads ahead of me...
390	Stannis I	2014-04-13	Well I don't know. Edmure and Blackfish are alive so I guess Frey lost that one. :/


Tullys were never kings and Edmure is a hostage. That dwarf scene ("I'm drowning"), I believe, could mean nothing (foreshadowing) or everything. Could mean, for instance, that Tywin arranged for Balon to be killed, and not Euron.Â

If they poisoned the pie they would have been planning on mass murder, not just offing Joffrey
392	Madfunkymonkey	2014-04-13	Â 
Didn't D&D eliminate Ros because the actress didn't want to do anymore nude scenes?Â  At least, that was the rumor.Â  Perhaps she is the new "random woman we can show nude and act as though that's part of the plot."Â  Giving her a role as Ramsay's henchwoman might be a set up for that...
Glad to hear it.Â  I hope she stays healthy.
Â 
Â 
Also, am I the only one unhappy that apparently Selyse and Stannis were already married during the siege of Storm's End?Â  It doesn't really matter since they already got rid of Edric Storm in the show, but I always liked how angry Stannis was that Robert bedded their cousin in his marriage bed and caused him not to have sons.


I assumed that the actress is question was the actress who plays Shae. Â 
Â 
Shae hasn't been nude since that rumor came out.
393	Rockroi	2014-04-13	I actually thought the show made it "obvious" that Olenna did it. Â But then again, that's to a Â person who has known that fact for 14 years.... so ...Â
394	ebevan91	2014-04-13	Has the preview of episode 3 been uploaded anywhere? I didn't watch it on my TV so I didn't get to see the preview.
395	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-13	It seems to have been lost in all the discussions about Joffrey and the PW, but Alfie Allen gave good Reek in this episode.
Â 
Â 


yeah reek was really good in this. Theon had that "not all there" look.
396	Newstar	2014-04-13	I assumed that the actress is question was the actress who plays Shae. Â 
Â 
Shae hasn't been nude since that rumor came out.


Â 
Except that Shae is still around and that character was always doomed, as opposed to non-book Ros who could have lived past Season 3, who was offed in 3x06, and whose entire arc in Season 3 seemed to be aimed towards writing her out.

I agree, seeing him struggle with his emotions after Ramsay trolled him..The feels..
399	Vegeta_Greyjoy	2014-04-13	Holy shit Balerion???!
400	shk12344	2014-04-13	Didn't D&D eliminate Ros because the actress didn't want to do anymore nude scenes?No, far as I recall, she didn't want to die naked. She wanted to keep her clothes for her dieing scenes so the producers let her.I believe her character was always meant to die.
401	mafalda	2014-04-13	Loved EVERYTHING to do with the Dreadfort, first off. Glad to see my favorite villain (Roose) back in action, and seeing him and Ramsay interacting was amazing. Â And that was a fine bit of acting from Alfie when Ramsay told him about Robb  Oh and Fat Walda... you KNOW Roose is riiiich!
Bronn would be the next best replacement for Ser Ilyn, so I have no gripes about that.
I have no words for the Stannis scene. And not in a good way.
I do have to say I'm conflicted about the way the showrunners are handling the Tyrion-Shae conflict. Shae had no reason to betray Tyrion when the time comes, which makes it even more horrible. But now they've given her a reason, which I feel like would make it not as bad when she betrays him. But then after I thought about it, I thought maybe that might make sense? I don't know..Â  
Oh and it also brings up the interesting point of has Bronn been paid off already? Or did Shae somehow sneak her way off the ship?? Is Varys involved???
Loved the scene where Joff is presented with his gifts and proceeds to shred the daylights out of Tyrion's gift. Speaking of that part, I'm surprised they didn't put in the bit about him being used to Valyrian steel.. or have the show watchers and runners just completely forgotten about that small scene from season one?Â 
Loved Oberyn's chat with the Lannisters and how he flat out does not care that Ellaria is there, and flaunts her and all her bastardness in front of them.Â 
Overall, great episode! I'm rewatching again, because even though I saw where Olenna fussed with Sansa's necklace, I didn't see where any stones were removed. Oh and what was with that awkward, quick shot of the inside of the pie? And where any of the dwarves Penny? someone else here said that the one with the dog helmet was the only one we didn't see, but we did because it took off the helmet and started bucking up against it. Ugh. And I had to laugh at Renly "riding Loras" ugh Joff is such an asshole. On another hand, Jack Gleeson's wonderful acting will be missed.Â 
Â 
Oh and one last thing. With having Jaime and Brienne arrive in KL so early, I thought they would actually have Jaime idly stand by while Joff died. Jaime has said in the books that he shows no paternal instinct towards Joffrey and does not consider the kids his, only Cersei's. So that combined with what an asshole Joff was to him last week (about his hand, then insults him with the book), then, I can't remember at what specifically, but Joff was being Joff again, and they showed a clip of Jaime rolling his eyes or something at him. I just KNEW he was going to stand there and do nothing when Joff dies, so it was out of character for him to rush in. Regardless of if he's in the white cloaks or not, and I knew it would throw a wrench into his relationship with Cersei. HE changes their relationship by turning him down. He's on a path to redemption and the showrunners are leaving out sooo many of his redeeming qualities. So the Unsullied look at me like I'm crazy when I say I like Jaime (yes he tried to kill a child and nothing changes that, but his story is interesting!) or when I say I want Stannis to be King (because look at how they portray him on the show).Â 
Â 
Ok, back to the show!

403	Fool of a Book	2014-04-13	Why did Bronn lie about Shae being taken care of? Â After Tywin told Cersei to send Shae to the Tower of the Hand, and she ran away from Bronn? Â He said Shae was on the ship? Â is this a set up for Shae to become Tysha Â and not suffer her fate in the book?

418	Ser Wun Wun	2014-04-13	Well, that confirms that the Queen of Thorns slipped Joff the poison.Â  You can clearly see her palm the jewel off of Sansa's necklace while fiddling with her hair, which is then missing a piece.Â  And when Tyrion picked up the cup to give Joff his last drink it had been sitting right in front of her at the table.Â  LF had already hinted at it strongly in the books, but it's nice to have it confirmed.Â 
Â 
Also, that whole convo with Bran about how he'll forget Winterfell and his familiy if he stays in his wolf for too long made me worry about Jon...I think the personality changes in him after he's resurrected are going to be more drastic than some people are anticipating.Â  Maybe some Lord Beric style memory problems.

Yes. I also think the snow-covered throne room is less a symbolic representation of the destruction of the existing Westeros power structure or foreshadowing that Jon will sit the Iron Throne (SNOW on the THRONE, geddit?), and more an actual vision of something that will come to pass: winter will come to KL (well, we knew that) and the Red Keep will be destroyed.

That's a really good point. If they were going to mess with shit and have Brienne in KL early, there really should have been a scene with Brienne and Sansa re: Catelyn, how she served her mother, respected her, gives her condolences to Sansa. I mean we got the scene with Marg, and now another exchange. Would have taken all of a few minutes.

Margaery already told her not to go around expressing her grief at the deaths of 'traitors', plus Cersei already has her marked for serving them so it wouldn't be the wisest move.

The Stannis scenes were originally supposed to be in the first episode, so GRRM didn't write them, unfortunately

I think that was a vision of Aegon's Balerion the black dread. Shadow the size of a 747. When I saw the trailer I was really wondering how they could have been so off on the size of the shadow, but now it makes sense. It's a vision of the biggest and oldest dragon Westeros has ever known.

For those saying Selyse is too pretty...While she's more attractive than Book Selyse, TV Selyse still doesn't hold a candle to TV Melisandre, which seems to be the important comparison here. (Tara Fitzgerald is pretty enough, but Carice van Houten is a stunner.)
Â 
I'm pretty pressed at Selyse casually burning her brother with no mention of the kinslaying curse. That was the PERFECT opportunity to mention it!

What the fuck? I actually feel a bit... sorry for him D:
445	Newstar	2014-04-13	I don't really understand why Jaime would train with Bronn rather than Brienne.
Â 
Brienne bested him when he still had his hand and mocked him afterwards for being overrated as a swordsman. Maybe Jaime doesn't want to be reminded of that, although I'm sure Brienne would be sensitive now given their improved relationship. He seemed awfully vulnerable when talking about his hand to Tyrion.

I think that was a vision of Aegon's Balerion the black dread. Shadow the size of a 747. When I saw the trailer I was really wondering how they could have been so off on the size of the shadow, but now it makes sense. It's a vision of the biggest and oldest dragon Westeros has ever known.

I also remember how in the books it seemed to be an important point that Tyrion was really, really drunk by the time Joffrey's choking rolled around. He seemed much more in command of his senses in the show.

Balerion lived for decades after Aegon died.
454	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-04-13	Pretty disappointed they opted to not include the Black Gate. It's not a vital scene, but it made Bran's story a lot more interesting. And at this rate, Coldhands probably wont make an appearance either.
Â 
The Obery vs the Lannisters was hilarious, non-subtle burns stacked on top one another. Loras' convo with Jaime was pretty awesome as well.
Â 
The episode was solid overall. Just lacked Wildling/Night Watch action. But they're gonna make up for it later on, no doubt.
455	House Ross	2014-04-13	Overall the Ep was very pleasing.
Â 
Melisandre eating was sort of upsetting. Selyse was entertaining haha. Stannis' face was priceless. Not enough Davos.
Â 
Reek is full blown Reek. Not sure how I feel about Locke going after the Stark boys. Im guessing he runs into some not so friendly peeps from north of the Wall....
Â 
As for the wedding, damn near spot on. As expected from Mr. Martin himself. The Robb dwarf was def hooded and noted as such. Joffs face, Cercei reaction, and Jamie's reaction as well were....legit. LOVED seeing a jewel missing after Lady Olenna played with Sansa's hair.Â

457	Thelastactionhero	2014-04-13	Yes, I know it's great to laugh at us Stannis fans having a terrible night. I'm probably about the only one who found his love for Shireen important, and potentially hopeful for future arcs, but overall I felt that while they did a really terrible job with him, the episode was quite good. Purple Wedding was everything I hoped for. I even liked the Ramsy-Roose scenes, despite the odd way in which they're handling Moat Cailan.Â
458	greensleeves	2014-04-13	Â

Â 
Yeah, I forgot about how tactful Bronn is. Â He is truly the most courteous and understanding of people. Â I'm sure that after their sparring session they will go out for ice cream and have a nice heart to heart. Â Â
459	Harry Lime	2014-04-13	Â 
He needs to establish a relationship with Bronn so he can take him to the Riverlands, Brienne is going her own way as we know.


Â 
Plus she likely had her sword and armor taken away while she's a guest of the Lannisters.
460	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-13	Â Ahaha, I love her "WTF...hiiii" face. I love her voice! I hope since she's no longer sneaking with Roose that now she'll wear some pink.

True, but Jaime wouldn't know that. Nor had he ever been beaten before by Bronn when he had his hand.
462	Fool of a Book	2014-04-13	Â 



That's a really good point. If they were going to mess with shit and have Brienne in KL early, there really should have been a scene with Brienne and Sansa re: Catelyn, how she served her mother, respected her, gives her condolences to Sansa. I mean we got the scene with Marg, and now another exchange. Would have taken all of a few minutes.


Â 
Â 


Â 
Wow I didn't even realize until now. Huge oversight.


Â 
Â 
Exactly, no matter how they spin it, it was a mistake to get Jaime and Brienne back to KL so early. Â It destroys Brienne's character ANDÂ we didn't even see Jaime react to his son's death! Â Not even a look at Cersei, not even a glance of concern, just one mid shot of him from the side with no emotion. Â So what was the point of changing the timing??
463	PhoenixFlame	2014-04-13	On a sadder note, oh my god poor baby kraken Theon. Reek. My heart was in pain. His face when Ramsay revealed Robb's death...I think his silent staring was less "imma gonna cut this fucker's throat" and more his "I should've died with him" monologue. I love how Roose was so soft and calm but so obviously pissed at how Ramsay handled things. Ramsay and Locke bro-ing out was funny.Â 
Â 
Also, given his slightly less brutish characterization on the show, I don't mind Ramsay having a female playmate. His tone when complimenting her shooting reminded me of Lestat's when he was fooling around with the hooker, if a tad more sincere. She's still just a toy to him. At most a Build-a-Bear.Â

On that note, there was a rather curious vision of an Other, or at least its reflection as Cersei is heard shouting "he saw us!". Did we get a glimpse of the Others' home?

466	Stannis-the-Mannis	2014-04-13	I rewatched the Stannis scene and don't have that much of a problem with it. He's clearly displeased with the burning. When Selyse told him he hated fish, he responds, "I hate a great many things but I suffer them all the same." It's clearly directed at Mel, tho they should have had Stannis make eye contact with her to hammer the point home IMO.

Â 
I love Jaime/Bronn training. I rooted for it so hard.
469	Justin Danford	2014-04-13	So it's Tyrions fault Shae will do what she does? I don't like that. I'm also far less confident Shae's story will take the same path it does in the book. In fact, I'm quite convinced Shae will be the reason Tryion asks the quesiton "Where do whores go?" That means a less brutal close to Tyrions story this season, but I suppose it makes sense for the show . . . not sold on it though.
470	PhoenixFlame	2014-04-13	Ramsay's "Why doesn't Daddy love me??!" face after Roose stepped away from him. It was almost saddening but, well, obviously the son is a shadow of the father.Â 
Â 
I did like that shot of Jaime shoving past people to get to Joffrey--and yelling "Joffrey" instead of "Your Grace."Â 
Â 
Oh oh, shadow over King's Landing. It was a crow, not a dragon. On my big TV the wings looked more feathery than membraned. The POV of a Bloodraven crow flying overhead?Â 
Â 
So many amazing little details! Joffrey laughing so hard he spits out his wine, while Margaery glances over with disgust. Tyrion glaring at Tommen's laughter at the dwarves, and the kid immediately shutting up.Â 
Â 
Oh, the Martells! I loved Oberyn in the audience during the wedding ceremony. Then, his sick burn. It looked like Tywin was almost amused at Oberyn swatting back at Cersei after she insulted his paramour and engaging in some Olennaesque Snark-to-Snark combat...until Oberyn took it up a notch and proved he wasn't just there for the appetizers. Tywin's obsessed with legacy, but he runs circles around so many characters I think his show version is a little pleased when someone can snark right back, a la Arya. Within reason of course.Â 
Â 
Was it just me or did the blood drain from Brienne's face as Cersei continued to stare at her silently? Then you have Jaime glancing over at them and probably thinking "OMG every fantasy I ever wanted!!!"Â

483	Darth Pipes	2014-04-13	I never thought that Bronn betrayed Tyrion. Tyrion asked Bronn to be his champion. Bronn was like "Dude, you pay me well, and you're cool and all, but that's the fucking Mountain. I'd die." and Tyrion basically is like well, thought I'd ask and doesn't seem to see it as a betrayal. Later when Bronn messes with them and names the baby Tyrion, I took that as a sign that he's still on Tyrion's side.
So, IDK what to make of the show changes here. If they have Bronn outright betray Tyrion, I'll be annoyed. I do wonder if Tywin got a hold of Shae, he could have nabbed her on the ship. Or what Varys's role in all this is, if he never was going to help her get to Pentos.


Â 
I never thought of it was a betrayal either.Â  I found it surprisingly realistic, something you don't see in books/television/movies that often.
Â 
Bronn is a sellsword.Â  He sells his sword for money.Â  It made sense for him to champion Tyrion in the Vale.Â  The potential rewards for him outweighed the risk.Â  What did he have to lose?Â  When Tyrion again needs a champion, Bronn lucks has changed for the better and he's no longer willing to risk his neck for Tyrion.Â  He likes Tyrion and is probably grateful to him but he's in this business for himself.Â  Even if he could beat The Mountain, Tyrion isn't in a position to give him anything for it.Â  So the risk isn't worth it.
Â 
I kind of hope they keep this point with Bronn but somehow I doubt it.
Â 
Show Shae can't take a hint to save her life or understand what Tyrion was trying to do.

Yup. It's going to be amazing.
Â 
...On the other hand, Shae is seriously deluded. She's seen up close and personal what Tywin and Cersei are capable of, and she still thinks Tyrion can successfully take them on? Moreover, she's seen how unwilling Tyrion is to choose her over his family despite the many, many times she's begged him to do so (asking him to flee in 2x10 and in 3x07), and she still thinks that he'll choose her? Finally, she clearly suspects in 4x01 that Tyrion is losing interest in her, and she still makes her big pitch to stay and fight? There's being in love, and then there's delusion, and Shae seems to fall into the latter category.

ETA it's the same problem I had with last week's episode... a simple look of reaction between Arya and the Hound would have made that scene a million percent better, even though it was a great scene.

...Now that I think about it, TV Shireen being disturbed by the burning of her uncle might be a hint from GRRM that she'll meet the same fate. Eep.


D: Noooooooo
Â 


wtf are you asking me wtf? Â sheesh. Â "they" made a decision to get Jaime into KL early and be present for Joff's death.... and didn't even show a millisecond of emotional reaction from him while Joff's eyes were filling up with blood? Â 


Go away.
Â 


Joffrey throwing coins at Sigur Ros so they would go away was also a nice touch.

The hipster boards I read are, of course, highly amused by this

Even though this is the discussion for the book readers, I won't be specific, but in the books, we have very good reason to know she did not actually leave.

RIIIGHT? Haters to the left! I also agree with you that the show did the dwarf tilts way better. Hell, i think i like the Purple Wedding itself much better in the show. Sometimes, adaptation does some things better. Mum worked out it was Olenna from the get-go. Shes sharp.
496	Newstar	2014-04-13	Sorry if I missed this, but why is everyone so certain that she didn't leave?


Â 
Because she has to be around to give testimony condemning Tyrion in 4x0_ (4x06 or 4x07, I'm guessing), something she can hardly do if she's chilling in Pentos.

501	Son of An Other	2014-04-13	I understand why they changed most of the things, including Sir Illyn, but two things I don't get:
Â 
1) Why Melisandre was burning Ser Axell Florent, instead of Ser Alester, and why he suddenly became Selyse's brother. Also, Stannis didn't command his death because he was a sinner (which would make him more of a fanatic), but because he tries to negotiate a peace treaty with Tywin Lannister behind Stannis' back.
Â 
2) Why Lady Olenna doesn't put her hands on Sansa's necklace, to remove one of the gems, possibly containing the poison that killed Joffrey.


Â 
I haven't yet read through the entire thread so apologies in advance if someone else has said this already.
Â 
If you pause the episode at the 33:47 mark you can see the Qot playing with Sansa's hair-braid-thing and you can just detect a hint of metal in her fingers. Then if you look again at the 33:49-50 mark, you can see that the stone that's right next to her braid is missing. It's harder to tell since her dress is a much more similar color than her skin, so the stones that are against her skin stand out MUCH more. As far as I can tell, it looks like a missing stone to me. It's not something that an unsullied (I assume that's a term for those who watch the show but haven't read the books?) would catch, but knowing exactly what to look for really helped. It was quite subtlety done actually imo.Â  Â
502	Zman1863	2014-04-13	Also....
Tyron killing Shae is going to be far more controvertional now...


Â 
Â 


I dont think they will let him kill her, it might be one of the changes of the show.
If they let him kil her they will probably make shae do something terrible so the audience sees that she deserves her death


Â 
I think they'll still get there in the end. We don't see Shae boarding a ship or anything, just Bronn saying she did- the guy who is discreet for the highest bidder according to the episode. And Varys apparently is involved in getting her there- who won't lie to Tywin or Cerei according to the episode. I think they are setting it up that Shae's didn't really leave and that Tywin and Cersei end up with her, something that was also mentioned in the episode.Â
503	When Harry met Sansa	2014-04-13	Sorry if I missed this, but why is everyone so certain that she didn't leave?


There's absolutely no way Shae left. Not only do we not see her leaving and even the Unsullied are left believing that she probably didn't leave given the way the scene was handled, her presence in the Tower of the Hand is too paramount to Tyrion's rationale behind killing Tywin. It exposes Tywin--certainty not for the first but ultimately the last time--as a terrible hypocrite and the fact that Shae indeed was lying to Tyrion the whole time is foiled with the revelation that Tysha was indeed what Tyrion thought she was--only a crofter's daughter.Â
504	Jasta11	2014-04-13	Great episode once again. Maybe it's just me, but the show has really improved its pacing since the beginning of season 4. No scene is wasted.
Â 
-The Dreadfort business was pretty good. I liked Fat Walda looking like she wanted to run the hell away from Ramsay, and then Locke being buddy-buddy with the bastard. Also the addition of Theon/Reek shaving his ''master'' was classic but effective.
Â 
-Bran's visions were suitably mind-screwy. That's twice we see the IT under snow, and in an episode wrote by GRRM no less. Too much foreshadowing to ignore methinks. Also yaya bloodraven!
Â 
-Stannis... ugh. The dinner scene I liked, he took a clear dig at his wife and showed his love for Shireen. But burning the Florents because they're ''indifels''? Come on. That's just idiotic. It's like if they had Dany feed people to her dragon because they were ugly or something. I heard GRRM didn't write those scenes, which kinda shows. Also liked Shireen herself not giving a fuck about Mel.
Â 
-Jaime and Bronn is hopefully the beginning of a new (gold-fueled) friendship.
Â 
-Tyrion and Shae... well at least she's gone now, but oh lord did she overstay her welcome. But I'm pretty certain Bronn lied to Tyrion. We'll see how they manage to make it work, but I'm still convinced Tyrion will kill her in the end. I did like Tyrion spilling his wine for Jaime; it was a very brotherly and supportive thing to do.
Â 
-Oberyn had few lines, but all of them golden. Pedro Pascal is a great actor, and I liked the threat towards Myrcella. Also, ''not you''.
Â 
-Poor, poor Sansa. She also had few lines, but the non-verbal language told everything.
Â 
And for the Purple Wedding, it was masterfully handled save for a few misgivings; Brienne not talking to Sansa is weird. The Kingsguard standing there while the king chokes to death wins a prize in the ''fuck this job'' category, surely. And Cercei went too quickly from shock to rage at Tyrion.
Â 
Everything else? Splendid. The subtle way Olenna got the poison in (we saw because we know about it and watched in stop-motion). Joffrey killing a bird in the pie. The ''war of the five kings'' which is just better than in the books. Joffrey trying Widow's Wail on Tyrion's book. Joffrey acting the like piece of shit he is in general. Loras burning Jaime. Cercei being privy to Brienne's obvious secret. And all the non-verbal language! Cercei finding her son's antics funny, while Tywin is exasperated, Sansa is horrified, and Marge has a ''yep, fine husband I have'' look. Tommen laughing, looking at his uncle and shutting up. Tyrion himself looking like he wants nothing better than toss the cup at Joff's face. Definitely one of the show's finest hour.
Â 
And the little bastard is finally dead. I'll miss his actor so much, he was amazing. Loved too how Jaime called out his son's name instead of a ''your grace''.
505	lil_z	2014-04-13	Pod+Oberyn+Ellaria+Upside down girl?? *Pod's eyeballs roll to the back of his head*

Â 
Dinklage can definitely do it.Â  He's done a great job with the character despite the fact that the writers have stripped every bit of darkness and shade of gray out of the character.Â  Saint Tyrion's behavior has become so predictable and risks becoming boring.Â  At this point, I fully expect Shae to strangle herself to death while Saint Tyrion watches helplessly and cries.

I like the focus of this episode. Contrasting between Melisandre and Bran and basically concentrating on KL. The Boltons were good (Allen's Reek brought some bad memories, as the follow up with the sausages) but it was OK...

My bad, I rewatched it and just noticed the tail. The screech is mixed into the crow caws so I got confused. I guess it's D&D being "We SWEAR she'll eventually get to Westeros!!!"Â 
Â 
Ehehe, when he smiled at Walda, my first thought was "he's like a handsome shark!" Yeah, I think on screen the shifting contradictions in his looks/dialogue are more interesting than "I'm a brutish nutcase muahahahaha." Not that he isn't an evil nutcase, it just comes across on the surface with more nuance. If he's to be one of the next major villains, he needs to at least be entertaining.Â

YESSUM! Her quiet torment during the dwarf show broke my heart. But that's totally when she showed the steel in her spine. In the context of the show's continuity, I liked her handing the cup to Tyrion. It's not about "warming up to him" at all, just her innate desire for being decent, much like she told Dontos "Anyone else would've done the same."Â 
Â 
The random dwarf show moment that was gold was the tentacles bursting out of the Balon dwarf.Â

Â 
Not after this episode I think. I think that Shae will be brought back to give evidence at Tyrion's trial as in the books. Based on the show, Shae has a plenty of justification to do so. Tyrion killing her at the end of the season might actually be pretty close to the tenor of the book. How can he complain of her "betraying" him if he sent her away as he did the last time they saw each other? It makes the killing the same sort of daddy revenge that it was in the books.

Yeah, I'm not at all sure they'll do it. They're odd, these writers; it's like they have a limit to how far they can go. Kill a baby at a wedding? Sure. But have Tyrion be an asshole...nah, that's Â too much.
Â 
I'm actually curious about how this ends now just to see how the writers resolve this plot they've written.

She has no justification. You don't get to kill someone (which is what she'll be trying to do) because they tried to send you away Â to keep you safe. The book reasoning is much stronger: she has no choice Â or loyalty to Tyrion so fuck him.

Â 
Hopefully we don't see vengeful Shae though. Christ, this plot is already melodramatic and tired enough.

That's nice to see that, but I would have liked a further nod to the book readers showing how and when it got in his drink/goblet, he pours out the goblet soon after, unless it is a very slow acting poison. And I don't directly recall them mentioning that Qot was the actualy culperate, only suspicions.
526	When Harry met Sansa	2014-04-13	I agree. What really irked me about this episode wasn't just the unnecessary BS like this-it's the fact that GRRM wrote this episode and chose to include it. Do we really need to deviate from the books so much for absolutely no point when we know the tiny little interactions tonight will go nowhere?
Â 
Setting up a Brienne-loves-Jaime-arc is just stupid; it's already been established that Brienne was in love with Renly, which the viewer is reminded of in episode 1 of this season when she immediately goes to see Margery and tell her of what happened in the tent the night Renly died. On top of that, we know already that Cat meant a good deal to Brienne as she respected her greatly and her desire to eventually seek out the missing Stark girls this season should be fueled by her honor and the promise she made to Cat, not out of some misguided love for Jaime arc that I feel the show is going to go down.
Â 
The other really unnecessary wedding interaction tonight was the Jaime-Loras exchange. Not only do we have the visual exchange between Loras and Oberyn that we could really do without (Look, the show is handling Oberyn 10x better than they handled Renly; this GoT Seanzoz parody still perfectly captures how book Renly was so B.A. and the show went a little over-gay with him Â https://www.youtube....h?v=dWgCMIg-E9Y), but then we have Jaime being so much weaker than we have him in the book as well. Along with Tyrion, Jaime probably has the best arc across the series and while we're sort of always on board for Team Tyrion, getting to root for Jaime starting in ASoS and onward is a really cool experience.
Â 
Yet last week rather than have Jaime come to the realization that there is still much he hasn't accomplished, which is sort of paramount to his arc's turn, it is Joffrey who reminds him, no doubt continuing to somehow make TV Joff worse than book Joff, who was still incredibly awful. The payout this week with Joff's death makes that scene from last week better, as it establishes that he can be a real shit to even the closest of his family members (we've seen this often with Tyrion, occasionally with Cersei.) But then this week that one look between Loras and Oberyn followed by the verbal beating that Jaime takes at Loras' hands is a little too much. Loras, just like Brienne, loved only Renly and begging Jaime to take the White Cloak is one of Loras' first actions once the two are in the same scene. The show seems to have other plans, which is annoying given Loras' arc later on and why he is so hellbent on taking Dragonstone.Â

I think they are setting it up that she is both in the custody of Tywin/Cersei and that she thinks Tyrion doesn't want her anymore. That means she has a grievance and no choice either way. I suppose it makes Tyrion seem a bit sympathetic since if you look close he was protecting her in the show. But he did it in a dickish way that doesn't win him any brownie points. I think they are actually on the right track for once.

Nah, they just don't give a fuck about him.Â  Alive or dead, he is no real threat to them.

Â 
I dunno about justification, but after 4x02 I can see why Shae would testify out of revenge, assuming that she isn't being compelled or forced: TV Shae really did love Tyrion, and she really thought she could have a life with him. It's pretty cold to pull the "You're only my whore" line, when he had been treating her as something much closer to a wife prior to his marriage to Sansa. He told her he loved her several times. No wonder Shae's so devastated to have her status as a whore thrown in her face and to be lumped in with Tyrion's other prostitutes, by a man who professed to love her. I would not be surprised in the slightest if she chose to go scorched earth on Tyrion's ass after that. She feared as early as 3x02 that Tyrion would throw her over for Sansa, and now her fears have essentially been realized. For all Tyrion's protests of his abiding love for Shae and his insistences that he has no interest in Sansa, he's kicked Shae to the curb using the most painful, demeaning language possible.

534	averde	2014-04-13	As a book reader I had some huge problems with this episode. The two biggest were...
1) Tyrion and Shae's scene. Either Shae is truly gone now, which ruins so many things. If things still play out in a similar fashion how will they handle the Shae murder? I just don't see how this can play out well at all. 
2) Stannis Baratheon. This was actually my first time being upset at how show Stannis has been portrayed (I know many Stannis fans have been upset for awhile). He killed Florent in the books for betraying him by trying to make a deal with Kings Landing, still a questionable execution I disagreed with but nothing like the crazy religious reason we saw on the show, Florent remained a follower of the seven so he's killed. I don't even see a reason for the change besides to portray Stannis in an even darker light.

537	HouseHarrison	2014-04-13	Good episode, my general thoughts:
Â 
*Reek and Moat Cailin stuff is coming way too early overall, and I think in general Reek appears far less ghastly/horrifying than I imagined him as.Â 
Â 
*I really hope they don't cut Penny. She's vital to saving Tyrion from insanity. Though they can easily write her in I imagine.
Â 
*Really don't like the direction they went with Shae, I think they should have made her just another whore instead of an angry lover regarding her betrayal, it was much more soul-crushing for Tyrion.
Â 
*The Purple Wedding was great and the horrifying affects of the strangler were shown brilliantly.Â 
Â 
*Passive-Aggressive Oberyn vs. Lannister fight was lulz
Â 
*Stannis burning Florent over being an "infidel" rather than trying to make peace behind his back was stupid
Â 
*Mace Tyrell is as big a doofus as I'd expect and Olenna snapping at him to go away was great.
Â 
*Changing Jaime to dueling with Bronn over Illyn Payne?!?! Noooo.
Â 
*BriennexJaime is obvious as hell in the books too. Though I don't think Brienne is necessarily so obviously in love this early.
Â 
*Tommen looks way too old despite the new actor
Â 
*Some of the visions Bran had were quite interesting, especially the scene of King's Landing ruined during winter which is the same vision Dany saw. I think GRRM shared that future plot with D&D.

538	lil_z	2014-04-13	Â I got a kick out that line.


Was deadpan obvious, "what kind of monster kills at a wedding?"
539	Konradsmith	2014-04-13	It's fitting that Ramsay's return and Iwan Rheon's firstÂ appearance as a main cast member coincides with Joffrey's death. Obviously I'm not the first to say this but Ramsay is very much "Joffrey...but worse" in the same way that Roose is the Marlo Stanfield to Tywin's Stringer Bell.
540	Queen of Whores	2014-04-14	Stannis just used the word "infidel"
OH.MY.FUCK.


Â 
Yeah, after that bit I kind of just did a Rust Cohle on this show: "I quit. Fuck this. Fuck this world."

Actor who played Ilyn Payne has terminal cancer.
543	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-14	Funny that Joffrey is "Joffrey of houses Lannister and Baratheon". Why didn't they just say "yes, it's true, he's inbreed, fuck off".

True. In retrospect, though, they've been laying the groundwork for Shae as furious scorned lover for a while now.

Nah, they just don't give a fuck about him.Â  Alive or dead, he is no real threat to them.
Â 
Even his offensive dwarf charicature is a lazy afterthought compared to the others.Â  He just yells "I'm drowning!" at one point.


Har. We are gonna get some Banana Peel of Off Screen Doom i believe.Â
546	The Taxman	2014-04-14	The show did a pretty damn good job. I just wished they didn't focus so much on Olenna during Tyrion/Joffrey chalice scene at the end or have her call out the choke job. Made it kinda too obvious after that... and Sansa is really beautiful. Her facial expressions alone were worthy of the screentime.Â
547	Castel	2014-04-14	Â 
Erm, Brienne's love for Jaime is canon. She thinks it when Stoneheart's hanging her. She can do something for honor but still feel love for someone.Â 


Also the scene doesn't even have to mean that she definitely loves Jaime. It just means that the question has taken her aback and she's now questioning how she feels about someone she hated just a few weeks ago. She doesn't have an obvious answer and she doesn't recover quickly when questioned by his sister of all people. That has to be awkward.
Â 
Sure, she probably does but that scene doesn't have to be the final word.


I dunno about justification, but after 4x02 I can see why Shae would testify out of revenge, assuming that she isn't being compelled or forced: TV Shae really did love Tyrion, and she really thought she could have a life with him. It's pretty cold to pull the "You're only my whore" line, when he had been treating her as something much closer to a wife prior to his marriage to Sansa. He told her he loved her several times. No wonder Shae's so devastated to have her status as a whore thrown in her face and to be lumped in with Tyrion's other prostitutes, by a man who professed to love her.
Â 
Â 

Â 

It's only because Shae is a moron and has been told multiple times that shit won't work out but she's apparently too dumb to hear.You would think that a whore who was a camp follower and then a handmaiden to one of the greatest victims of the Lannisters, one who was poised to see exactly what happened in court to people who came to the attention of Joff or his family would know better.
Â 
If a guy tells you to leave for your own safety and then you refuse, then he bashes you over the head and forces you to leave then you should know what's up.
Â 
But no,still not "just".Â 
Â 
But of course, that doesn't mean it won't happen. I hope not, but it's possible. As someone said above: they could just take her at this emotional time and force her to confess. It's not like she's in a particularly good mood. It's possible she just takes up with Tywin there.


True. In retrospect, though, they've been laying the groundwork for Shae as furious scorned lover for a while now.
Â 
Â 

Yes. Block by agonizing block. Glad that's over with.

548	l2 0 5 5	2014-04-14	Mace seemed more of a klutz than I thought he'd be (that's saying something).Â
549	When Harry met Sansa	2014-04-14	I don't believe the love she has for Jaime in the books is the same love she has for Renly; with Jaime it is almost like a sibling thing, like a brother. They've been through a lot together; it is, for lack of a better comparison, a love between men who fight together, like what Robert and Ned had-brothers bound by war and hardship. The love she has for Jaime isn't the same as what she felt for Renly. I mean if that's your point I guess I see that slightly but still her honor to Cat is the main reason she heads out and she feels like she owes Jaime as well. That wasn't what Cersei meant tonight when she asked her, and her response didn't indicate that either, so it's just likely, knowing how the show operates, that they will try to make that the main motivation.Â 


Â

Was the "Renly" dwarf supposed to be riding Loras???!?
551	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-04-14	*Passive-Aggressive Oberyn vs. Lannister fight was lulz

Â 
It wasn't much of a fight. Oberyn verbally decimated the both of them. When he mentioned the murder/rape Tywin's expression went from a false smile to "Shit.. they're still angry about that."
552	The Abominable SnowOther	2014-04-14	Also the scene doesn't even have to mean that she definitely loves Jaime.

when shit like that happens on tv its LOVE
553	The Taxman	2014-04-14	Of course Bronn lied to Tyrion. They will reveal later on that Bronn is a true sellsword and whoever pays him the most is who he works for. Tywin and Cersei both have more money than Tyrion so of course Bronn will take their side.
Â 
Still, Bronn will remain bros with Tyrion since he names his son Tyrion.Â 
Â 
Tyrion will kill Shae. The show loves the omg moments so it will be asinine if they went any other route.Â

554	Raksha 2014	2014-04-14	Ramsay giving Fat Walda a nice welcome was unexpected.Â  But that's the way Ramsay operates...he'll give you a friendly first impression and gradually reveal what a monster is.Â  If something ever happened to Roose, Ramsay would eat Fat Walda alive.


Â 
Â 
Ramsay's welcome didn't look all that nice to me; there was something really odd about his face, the smile too facile and the eyes looked evil. Â Good acting by Rheon. Â If I were Walda, I'd go home to Freyville (or try to get Ramsay killed) ASAP.
555	The Taxman	2014-04-14	Ramsay is looking pretty sexy in his new gettup. He looks like some ugly Vampire in the books but show Ramsay way better. Theon looked decimated when he found out Robb died.Â
556	Lady Olenna	2014-04-14	Everyone was so focused on the necklace, didÂ anybody catch what Olenna said to Sansa:

I lol'd my butt off when she said this. 
Most people believe she's behind it but the show pretty much set it up that it was her. I always wondered if if was Garlan, but I don't think he exists in the show.
557	NOT A TARG I SWEAR	2014-04-14	They did an excellent job, once again, of writing Sansa out of her own POV chapter.Â  She had, what, two lines, and no scenes of her own?Â  And no agency whatsoever.
Â 
The death was handled fairly nicely.
Â 
The Bolton scenes were quite good, actually, which is a nice change of pace.


I'm glad they did that with Sansa, as Tyrion's perspective is far more important here. Agree with you about the Boltons. I was fearing more Ramsay after the monotony of last season, but the interactions with Roose were really good.
558	Justin Danford	2014-04-14	There's absolutely no way Shae left. Not only do we not see her leaving and even the Unsullied are left believing that she probably didn't leave given the way the scene was handled, her presence in the Tower of the Hand is too paramount to Tyrion's rationale behind killing Tywin. It exposes Tywin--certainty not for the first but ultimately the last time--as a terrible hypocrite and the fact that Shae indeed was lying to Tyrion the whole time is foiled with the revelation that Tysha was indeed what Tyrion thought she was--only a crofter's daughter.Â 


Â 
Although I'm no longer convinced the show chooses to go down the same road with Shae being a liar. In fact, the big change seems to be Tyrion lying to Shae because he think it'll save her life. I don't know how they are going to play the Tywin/Shae scene we can suspect (based on the trailers) is coming, but I get the feeling Tysha is cut, and Tyrion will go off looking for Shae in the end. This makes some sort of sense since no one is going to remember who Tysha is without the luxary of reading Tyrions inner monologue like we can in the books. This is a wobbly new direction they are taking, the only way I can see myself happy with it is if they eventually merge it with the Penny storyline. Penny needs to be cut. From the book (too late) and the show. If they send off Shae to have Tyrion find her later on in placed of Penny, that could work....maybe....
559	The Abominable SnowOther	2014-04-14	Okay... I just re-watched the wedding scene:
Â 
Was the "Renly" dwarf supposed to be riding Loras???!?


  i completely missed that, but who else? fuck it! im running with it
Â 
OMFG thats was Loras being ridden
560	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-14	Mace is epic. Â I love it.
561	Ghost from Winterfell	2014-04-14	Joffrey's face was fantastic!
Â 
Bran's visions and Bloodraven's voice was great! Hope the Unsullied start noticing that Bran is very important and his storyline is intriguing.
Â 
Glad to see they are venturing into nasty Cersei once more. She is absolutely hateful in every scene she in. Lena did a good job. Starving the poor just to spite Margaery? That's your queen.
Â 
Very disappointed with Stannis' scene. Another instance of "hapless king Stannis in Melisandre's thralls".
Â 
Will Michael McElhatton ever be promoted to main cast?  Guess we won't see him again until after Moat Caillin.
Â 
Shae and Tyrion... just 
Â 
Everyone in the Dreadfort was brilliant, specially Allen.

Â 
Actually, when Tyrion told one of the servants to pay each of the dwarfs 20 pieces of Gold during that debacle he said something along the lines of "I'll find a better way to thank the King" or something to that effect which would lead show watchers to really believe it was Tyrion... regardless, trust me, there are people out there who really think Tyrion is responsible.Â

565	Newstar	2014-04-14	It's possible she just takes up with Tywin there.
Â 
Does she need a justification to take up with Tywin? He's a total DILF (GDILF?).  (Kidding...kind of.)
Â 
Â 
Â 
It's only because Shae is a moron and has been told multiple times that shit won't work out but she's apparently too dumb to hear.
Â 
In Shae's defence, Tyrion's guilty of mixed messages. He's been warning Shae for a while now about how dangerous KL Is, but all the while he's continued his relationship with her and has made no real move to end it, even though nothing was stopping him before. Even in 3x07, his plan was to set Shae up in a nice house as his permanent mistress and support any children they might have, a view hardly compatible with someone afraid for a loved one's life. So it's no surprise that when he warns Shae about the danger in 4x01 and 4x02, she's not seeing it as a basis for ending the relationship--since the danger never led Tyrion to consider ending the relationship before--and is rightly angry that he seems to be giving up on their relationship now when he was previously prepared to maintain it in spite of the risks.

Nah...dont even bother. Shae doesnt have a defense, especially in the show where shes just completely insufferable. Im shocked people arent rooting for her death yet.Â

Would have depended on the non-readers remembering that the dagger was Valyrian steel..small enough chance of that so better leaving it out altogether.
569	Le Cygne	2014-04-14	Erm, Brienne's love for Jaime is canon. She thinks it when Stoneheart's hanging her. She can do something for honor but still feel love for someone.It sure is. Pretty classic way of writing it. Their interactions were full of romantic and sexual imagery ("fucking instead of fighting," for starters). And GRRM wrote the episode.And also... he said so! Beauty and the Beast is a love story. He's got a couple going on in the story, Sansa and the Hound is a classic version, but lots of hints about this one throughout, too.http://tvline.com/20...-brienne-jamie/

Pretty sure it was revealed already.

Nonetheless, it's all irrelevant at this point. If you think Joffrey needed anymore reasons for people to find his death satisfying then you clearly haven't been paying attention.Â
571	Konradsmith	2014-04-14	Â Queen of Whores,Â so Stannis using the word "infidel"Â makes you ignore the great family dynamics scene? Stannis was obviously not happy about what was going on, he gave his wife the cold shoulder when she babbled fervently and he plainly felt none of that fervour himself. He was allowingÂ the burning to take placeÂ which is a change to the book canon and he used religious language to rationalize it, but it seemed the guy disobeying him pissed him off more. But seriously if this episode makes you abandon the show...then we're not watching the same show.

I mean I agree that the Shae-lying part can be changed; they've done a good job of setting Shae up to be a "spurned lover" so that bit could work, but there's still no way she's not in the Tower with Tywin if that happens. Also the show does an excellent job of setting up what will happen in the coming episode in the 3-4 minutes of "Previously on Game of Thrones-look at Episode 1 with the scene from S2 where Lommy dies, then have Arya kill Polliver at the end of the episode (also thought it was hilarious GRRM released the new Arya chapter from TWoW on the same day with her saying the same words to Raff).
Â 
If the show is going to work the spurned-lover Shae theme, Tyrion will still kill her before he kills Tywin. She'll be there-we still NEED the motivation for Tywin to die and I don't think Tysha is enough. That said, if they choose to get rid of Shae completely, I almost want to guarantee they'll do a "Previously on Game of Thrones" scene from S1 when they're in the tent and Tyrion talks about Tysha, then have Jaime tell him the story when Tyrion is escaping and have that be the sole motivation for killing Tywin. They absolutely have to have one or the other, and obviously I hope they have both.
573	Le Cygne	2014-04-14	I don't believe the love she has for Jaime in the books is the same love she has for Renly; with Jaime it is almost like a sibling thing, like a brother.

She's just like a sister to him.

Â 
I think it's that it has no relevance anymore now that Joff is dead. The astute watchers of the show already know that LF encouraged the strife between the Starks and Lannisters. When GRRM reveals that Joffrey was the instigator of the attempt on Bran, it comes like two chapters before Joffrey dies. On the first reading it looks relevant because Tyrion is considering taking Sansa and leaving court ASAP. On a second reading it comes off strongly as GRRM closing the book on Joffrey and telling the reader not to think about it anymore.Â

Â 
Perhaps the former poster should re-watch the episode. Tywin explicitly stated he wanted Shae to be in the tower of the hand after the wedding.
Â 
Tyrion will kill Shae. Shae will die. It's that simple. Tysha is pretty irrelevant, even in the books imo, we all know she will never appear again in the books. Â
577	Newstar	2014-04-14	She's just like a sister to him. 


Haw! 
Â 
"Are you sure you're not a Lannister?" in 4x01 sounded an awful lot like a pickup line coming from Jaime.
Â 
Tyrion will kill Shae. Shae will die. It's that simple.
Â 
Pretty much. The show has always preserved the "major beats" of the books, even if it takes various detours between those major beats.

Har-har, very funny, but what I am trying to say is that Jaime and Brienne are like a pair of brothers; they are both masculine. Brienne's interaction with Jaime, her blushing when they're naked together in the bath and everything is because she's extremely awkward when it comes to men (virgin, hasn't really seen too many naked dudes, Jaime saves her from being raped, etc.). There is little to suggest an actual lust between Jaime and Brienne. GRRM as I'm sure most people know also was a producer on the Beauty and the Beast TV series, so the connection there is evident, but still IMO not very likely to actually happen given the overall lack of evidence.

585	Lone Star Pate	2014-04-14	Enjoyed this episode immensely.Â  The way the camera pans over to Tyrion picking up the chalice while Joffey gets coughey with both Jaime and Cersei futilely rushing over to him was masterful.
586	The Taxman	2014-04-14	Har-har, very funny, but what I am trying to say is that Jaime and Brienne are like a pair of brothers; they are both masculine. Brienne's interaction with Jaime, her blushing when they're naked together in the bath and everything is because she's extremely awkward when it comes to men (virgin, hasn't really seen too many naked dudes, Jaime saves her from being raped, etc.). There is little to suggest an actual lust between Jaime and Brienne. GRRM as I'm sure most people know also was a producer on the Beauty and the Beast TV series, so the connection there is evident, but still IMO not very likely to actually happen given the overall lack of evidence.


Â 
The whole Brienne/Cersei scene was more to actually depict how ridiculous and mad Cersei has gotten in her head. Notice after that scene she proceeds to lambast Pycelle. Just more character development for Cersei than anything to do with Brienne/Jaime really.
587	Madfunkymonkey	2014-04-14	It was rather nice to see right after the guy who married Joffery state the part about being torn apart the camera was on the Grandmother.

Perhaps the former poster should re-watch the episode. Tywin explicitly stated he wanted Shae to be in the tower of the hand after the wedding.
Â 
Tyrion will kill Shae. Shae will die. It's that simple. Tysha is pretty irrelevant, even in the books imo, we all know she will never appear again in the books. Â 


Tysha is most definitely not irrelevant for a number of reasons, but it's kind of super important in the privy scene since Tyrion literally asks Tywin one question, and that is "What did you do with Tysha?". Tywin's goading to the answer makes Tyrion pulling the trigger all the easier.Â

You're RIGHT.
596	PhoenixFlame	2014-04-14	She's just like a sister to him. 


 
Â 
Lena killed it in this episode too. Her "all out of fucks" takedown of Pycelle, lashing out at Margaery Diana, shoving Jaime away from Joffrey... They could've directed it to have her screaming, but I think that would be a too on-the-nose mirroring of the RW. Also, Cersei lashes out a lot, but she's rarely loud about it. The main time I recall is her screaming at Tyrion when Myrcella was getting shipped off.Â

Minor changes???Â Is that a joke? Stannis burning people for not converting religions is aÂ hugeÂ change to his character.

If you look carefully, "Robb" was wearing a wolf's head for most of the joust, and when it was removed, "Robb" was wearing a red skullcap and had some sort of veil partially obscuring his/her face; when "Robb" falls, it's away from the camera. Seems like a good way of futzing "Robb" being played by a female actress.

Â 
I actually just remembered that Penny is a necessity since she needs to be there with Tyrion in book 5 getting Lion chopped. I think the reason they didn't reveal the face of the KitN is because they haven't found a suitable female dwarf for Tyrion to kiss yet.Â
613	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-14	Btw, did anyone notice Penny was not part of the dwarf jousting? I saw all men and no women.

Quite annoying. He does seem a bit conflicted but in the end that just shows he doesn't have a backbone to confront Melisandre. Because that's what Stannis is all about, right? It's not like he has a strong will or anything. He is the hapless dull king and evil Melisandre is pulling all his strings.

Well, she doesn't necessarily need to be tied to the dwarf joust.

627	Epyon	2014-04-14	Some thoughts/things that bothered me:
Â 
1. Saw it twice, and while I thought there might be a stone missing from the right side (Sansa's left) of the necklace.... I never actually saw Olenna take it, let alone touch the cup...
Â 
2. There was also literally no way Tyrion could have poisoned the wine, with the entire wedding party literally staring directly at him. There should literally be a multitude of witnesses that can testify he's innocent, with the way the show framed it.
Â 
3. Margery is handed the cup from Joffery, and purposely doesn't drink from it/sets it down.Â  It's quite likely show Margery knew -something- was going to happen.
Â 
4. They don't at all run with the implication that it was Joffery who sent the assassin after Bran.... I can't for the life of me figure out why they'd leave that out.
Â 
5. Shae's storyline feels really awkard..... I'm not of the opinion that she gets whitewashed comepletely and survives, because her death is, imo, half of what really "breaks" Tyrion and sends him to that dark place for the next couple of books (the other half being the true story of Tysha)
Â 
6. The implication that Bronn, or Varys have betrayed Tyrion directly seems strange.
Â 
7. Loras and Oberyn eye****ing each other seemed odd too.... Aren't the Martells and Tyrells on very unfriendly terms?
Â 
8. Stannis being a believer.... da hell...?
Â 
9. Cersei as a -former- Queen Regeant was able to order Pycelle to directly contradict a decree from Joffery (announced by acting Queen Margery). It's the third time Cersei has -publicly- commited HIGH TREASON (The first being when she burns an official sealed letter from King Robert, and the second being when she slaps Joffery in the throne room)

Not knowing what's coming next aside from some of the major plot points is one of the main draws of this show for me too.Â  It's interesting to see how the showrunners tweak the original storyline here and there.Â  I wouldn't be surprised to see Penny show up as a character later on when Tyrion washes up on a ship bound for Essos.Â  There maybe one of the dwarf mummers from the band that was atot the wedding.Â  Guess we'll have to see.Â  Still so much show to go between now and then!

OH.MY.FUCK.


Melisandre should already have been saying "infidel" -- it's a perfectly sensible word for how she views non-believers, and fits in to our contemporary life. The audience immediately understands that the person uttering it is a religiously intolerant totalitarian.
Â 
But Stannis? Ridiculous. But, I suppose it's just more of the same thing that HBO has been doing in making his character dishonorable.

9. Cersei as a -former- Queen Regeant was able to order Pycelle to directly contradict a decree from Joffery (announced by acting Queen Margery). It's the third time Cersei has -publicly- commited HIGH TREASON (The first being when she burns an official sealed letter from King Robert, and the second being when she slaps Joffery in the throne room)
Â 
10 The Brienne and Cersei scene...just struck me as weird.


After seeing the episode for the second time you can clearly see Olenna take the stone and there are several shots of Sansa with a missing stone after Olenna takes it.
Â 
Now I didn't see Olenna pass the stone off to anyone but she had to.
642	Colonel Green	2014-04-14	4. They don't at all run with the implication that it was Joffery who sent the assassin after Bran.... I can't for the life of me figure out why they'd leave that out.
7. Loras and Oberyn eye****ing each other seemed odd too.... Aren't the Martells and Tyrells on very unfriendly terms?


4. Because that reveal is pretty much irrelevant at this point, and would just have confused people.
Â 
7. That has never been established on the show (and there's no Willas for Oberyn to have injured).
643	Newstar	2014-04-14	The "Joffrey" dwarf was somewhat memorable and im thinking he will play a part in introducing "penny" somehow.Â 


Â 
I noticed that. Very charismatic.
644	sun moon stars rain	2014-04-14	Â 
Â 
Shae's storyline feels really awkard..... I'm not of the opinion that she gets whitewashed comepletely and survives, because her death is, imo, half of what really "breaks" Tyrion and sends him to that dark place for the next couple of books (the other half being the true story of Tysha)
Â 
Her storyline was truly awkward because D&D made the mistake of changing her character in the first place. Â GRRM was right to worry that it might be a problem down the line. Â In the book, her death was still upsetting even though she was more whore than woman in love. Â She's so boring too. Â 
Â 
I felt sick inside during the whole Joff/Tyrion-Dwarf display. Â ST did some of the finest face acting I've ever seen. Â I think it was always obvious that Tyrion had nothing to do with this. Â He was railroaded from the beginning. Â
645	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-04-14	I wouldn't be surprised if Penny was cut altogether.
646	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-14	Who Dunnit?
Â

omg This is gr9. Sharing!! Tommen's is the best.
Â 


I wouldn't be surprised if Penny was cut altogether.


Pretty sure she is.Â 


The joust. Jesus... it's so... there is anybody there who wasn't either offended or disgusted?


It was so brilliant.Â
647	Darkbringer	2014-04-14	GRRM clearly stopped short of having Stannis burn people for religious reasons alone. But nooooo, D&D just went and did it anyway. It would have been just as easy to keep the traitor plotline, but they didn't. If the Battle at the wall is anything but a full rehabilitation for Stan, then D&D have a lot to answer for. First babies in jars, then the beach scene, now this.
648	darkstar95	2014-04-14	Loved Bran's visions. There's one scene of the throne room that looks like the same one from Dany's vision. Â Also, the dragon flying over king's landing was pretty awesome.
649	The Taxman	2014-04-14	After seeing the episode for the second time you can clearly see Olenna take the stone and there are several shots of Sansa with a missing stone after Olenna takes it.
Â

Â 
You can see it as the camera zooms you can she as she walks by Joffrey you hear a very distinct clink sound hitting the chalice. Can't be way too damn obvious now.Â

I listened for the clink but I didn't hear it. Â Since you are not the only one to mention a clink it must have happened.
651	When Harry met Sansa	2014-04-14	Love isn't always about lust, you know.


I mean, I kinda wrote 1 or 2 pieces on how Jaime-Brienne have a sort of "brotherly love" if you will, you know 
Â 
But seriously, the Jaime-Brienne-end-up-together theory just doesn't work for me. You have to have some element of lust to make that work and I literally don't see any. Jaime "felt his cock stir" when they're together in the bath after "he caught a glimpse of the thick blond bush at the juncture of her thighs as she climbed out. She was much hairier than his sister." His immediate thought is "Now I know I've been too long away from Cersei." Any physical response from his body in that scene, which is the extent of their physical contact with each other, is based solely on human nature I.E. Jaime hasn't seen anyone naked in a while, natural response from his body which he is immediately repulsed by as Cersei is the only one he's ever physically longed for.
Â 
Part of what makes Jaime's arc so great is that when he finally comes to grips with the fact that fucking his sister for forever actually was pretty effed-up, he begins to actually take his Kingsguard duties seriously and begins trying to become a better person. All hint of lust towards women is gone; see the Pia stuff in Feast for an example. Can Brienne and Jaime have some sort of love for each other? Sure. But it is certainly not a physically-based kind; if anything, they have a brotherly love, battle-bred warrior love for each other, as one man would have for another and that's it. The rest will be left to fan-fic.Â
652	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-14	Since Ned's beheading I haven't feel this way about a death. It was simply horrifying.
Â 
Â 
I felt terrible for Jaime. The way he ran to joffrey. Come one, this aren't the books, it was his son =(
653	Queen of Whores	2014-04-14	I mean, I kinda wrote 1 or 2 pieces on how Jaime-Brienne have a sort of "brotherly love" if you will, you know

Â 
Summed it up perfectly. It's annoying when people desperately try to come up with reasons and "evidence" that they are in love. Thinking about each other often does not automatically mean romantic love.
654	The Lady Leela	2014-04-14	Suddenly I regret reading the books before watching the show.Â 
Â 
Everything was so unsatisfying. Cersei's reaction to Joffrey's death was piss poor. Joffrey's death was piss poor. They downplayed the whole thing. As a new book reader, I was expecting this to be a two episode event at the most. I thought that since they skipped Garlan altogether, they would use Oberyn in his stead. But Oberyn was just a blur. I just... maybe I need to sleep on it.
Â 
I hated that scene between Cersei and Brienne. Come ooooooooon. Cat fight, much? I'm gonna get hell for this, but I really hate Jaime being in KL for all of this. I hate the whole "jAime n BriEnnr in luv" plot. It worked in the books, but it sucks on the show. I liked Jaime in season 3, but this season they're just trying too hard to pretty boy him, and I hate that.
Â 
Mace... what? I guess he really did live up to being a total oaf, but really? He was even more foolish than Dontos.
Â 
I know the show can't help the child actors aging, but it was really hard for me to concentrate through those Bran scenes. Same with Meera and same with Shireen. They hit the jackpot with Maisie Williams because she's an actual waif, but I could've done without sudden teenage Shireen. That was unnecessary. Stannis's entire plot in this episode was unnecessary. They should've cut that off and spent more time on the PW.
Â 
Ramsay/Theon: waste of time. I'm sorry, it's okay for them to show hookers getting murdered, children and babies being killed, women getting raped... but they need to totally vanilla Theon's storyline? Are you fucking kidding me? Also, who was that crazy bitch with Ramsay? Wow, they totally completely fucked that storyline. So I'm guessing there's gonna be no Jeyne. No thank you. I'm so pissed about this. I was so looking forward to Reek's storyline. Now I hope they don't even bother. Fucking hell.
Â 
Things I actually did like:Â 
Â 
1. Sansa still ain't having none of it. Good.Â 
Â 
2. Margaery is just wonderful.Â 
Â 
3. I know a lot of people are hating the Shae plot, but I think the show is doing a better job at it.Â 
Â 
4. Sassy Loras.Â 
Â 
5. Hodor
Â 
Â 
Sigh. What a let down. I thought this was gonna be the episode of the century. I'm so worried that the show is losing its edge.

Â 
So much about the Stannis line is different and in tonight's ep. Selyse is pretty critical of her which could suggest they could reasonably justify taking the plot in that direction at some point in the future. Shireen fits the "King's Blood" requirement that is needed. Again, I'm not suggesting that this happens, either in the books or the show, just that D&D could potentially float it out there.

Â 
Maybe because the books payed special attention to Theon's emotional and physical breakdown while simultaneously showing us what a hideously malicious creature Ramsay is. The books also treated us to third party witnesses to Ramsay's sadism and never tried to present him in a remotely human way.
Â 
But if you're okay with the show completely overseeing Theon's storyline and then only airbrushing his teeth yellow and making Ramsay kinda just this guy then hey, I respect your opinion. Maybe you could try respecting other's.

667	stunningsteve	2014-04-14	I just rewatched the Olenna and Sansa scene and you can clearly see when she takes one of the stones. I also heard the "plonk"-noiseÂ  while she was walking back to her seat. However that could not have been the moment she dropped the stone into the jar, because it happened while she was before Margaery. The jar used by Tyrion later to fill Joffreys cup was standing before Cersei. Therefore I think she dropped the stone on one of the fruit plates next to Margaery. SheÂ  took it a some point and putÂ  in the the filled cup after taking it from Joffrey just before he was cutting the pie.
Â 
Â 
Â

Actually, it seems they are confirming the opposite.
He was pissed as ***** when his wife suggested beating the "right" religion into her.Â 
And just look at the glare he gave Mel (and her priceless reaction to it) after his wife said Mel should speak to Shireen.
It screamed "I better not find one more scar or burn upon her face."

I'm not saying Stannis does anything with it and I'm not saying Stannis wouldn't be against it, because he would. I'm saying that they could have Mel suggest it; it doesn't matter that Stannis would be abhorred by it. Show Selyse, like book Selyse, is the more religiously fervent in their marriage and more likely to, in the scenario that I think D&D could create, tell Mel/Stannis it. Obviously I'd agree Stannis would be super pissed at hearing that but with how much they've already changed his plot I could see them molding it into his mind over time.
679	DornishPepper	2014-04-14	I was really hoping Jaime would not just be an ass to Loras and invite him into the Kingsguard. Â But I think I'm the only person who cares that he isn't in a white cloak.Â 

This is something I must have missed and am curious about. Is Loras not Kingsguard on the show? I guess he must not be if he is betrothed to Cersei. Wonder why they made the change.

Â 
A surprising number of them think Tywin might be behind it (apparently forgetting that bit where Tywin establishes he won't even kill Tyrion for the sake of convenience).
Â 
Sansa's suspected too, though that mostly has to do with "she's a Stark and he's put her through hell" so it's her motive/narrative satisfaction trumping all.
Â 
I actually haven't seen anyone accuse Loras, though!
Â 
I like how this, at least early on, has a "who shot JR?" quality to it.
682	ARYa_Nym	2014-04-14	Well, that confirms that the Queen of Thorns slipped Joff the poison.Â  You can clearly see her palm the jewel off of Sansa's necklace while fiddling with her hair, which is then missing a piece.Â  And when Tyrion picked up the cup to give Joff his last drink it had been sitting right in front of her at the table.Â  LF had already hinted at it strongly in the books, but it's nice to have it confirmed.Â 
Â 
Also, that whole convo with Bran about how he'll forget Winterfell and his familiy if he stays in his wolf for too long made me worry about Jon...I think the personality changes in him after he's resurrected are going to be more drastic than some people are anticipating.Â  Maybe some Lord Beric style memory problems.


Â 
I'm not surprised. I've never understood why whenever the subject of Jon or Arya possibly dying and going into Nymeria that fans say it will preserve them. Varamyr's prologue implied the opposite to me. They say you forget. They fade until there's nothing of them left.

I think they'll get to it eventually, probably within the next episode or two so Loras can opt-out of marrying Cersei. Yeah, I'm not sure why they didn't make him ask for it in the show version when he asks Joff to marry Margery, they easily could have had him do both then. But since taking the White allowed him to avoid marriage I'm sure they'll have him do it soon. That was the only good thing I took out of the Jaime-Loras conversation from the episode, that it plants that seed in Loras' mind.

1. joffers died like a bitch )))))
2. i feel so bad for theon by now. and yes. theon. i refuse to call him that other name. the shaving scene was aweful to watch. and "yes master" so sad. im curious to see what my show watcher only friends say about him.
3. whats up with shae? and whats up with bronn? is he turning on tyrion? if so, i dont like it. its one thing to not want to die for him, but openly betraying him would be much worse.
703	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-14	Sorry if it's been brought up (no doubt someone's pointed it out, but I'm not going through 30+ threads), but I noticed early on people talking about how none of Sansa's gems were missing. Pretty sure there was an empty spot on her far left, half hidden up near her collar.
Â 
You could see Olenna remove her hand as if holding something, then going to pocket it. Just my stray observation, anyway.

705	Rill Redthorn	2014-04-14	In regard to Bronn and Shae: at first I thought he only said he put her on a ship, and I thought to myself "Well, she probably got right back off again, that's how she'll end up with Tywin." But on rewatching, Tyrion specifically asks Bronn if he saw the ship set sail, and Bronn says "Yes."
Â 
However, there are a couple of ways Shae could get back without Bronn betraying Tyrion. One is she could grab one of the ship's boats (the small utility boats every large ship had in those days) and row it back by herself, and the second, more likely way, is that if someone saw Bronn and Shae leaving and saw what boat she got on, they could send a faster boat after Shae's boat, tell it to hold up on the orders of the King's Hand, and just take Shae off it and back into the city.
Â 
I'm inclined to bet on the second one myself, because we know that Cersei was watching Shae's every move that day.

I had to go back and re-watch that scene where Olenna spoke to Sansa and fiddled with her hair ... then there it was, yep - she briefly fiddled with the necklace as well. Next cut to sansa's face, you see the missing gem on the right side by her collar bone and edge of her dress.Â

- Loved Ramsey and Rooses interactions, poor Theon, even Roose seems a bit intimidated by his bastard. Still can't believe Ramsays actor thinks Joffrey is worse than him
- I didn't know Oberyn was supposed to be Gay/bi? Is that just a twist added by HBO?
- Isn't it funny that Cersei was the only one amused by Joffreys actions at the wedding and the rest were disgusted, hopefully now she starts acting like book Cersei from now on
- Loved Jack Gleeson, he went out with a bang.

Â 

Â

Yeah im thinking that. We wanna see something awesome in that but its really just..what it is.
717	setmyheartafire	2014-04-14	First, I'm chuffed by the changes GRRM made in this epi. I love that he is so versatile and can use this medium to tell his story too. I love that it gives him a chance to add to what he already put out, to show things that don't work in his narrative, and to change things up without completely re-imagining his work. 
The exchanges between the characters at the wedding were fantastic and some were even theory fodder for me.
I am so not a Dorne fan but I love this Oberyn and am completely sad to know where his plot is heading. I could definitely do with a lot more Viper. I loved how he put Cersei in her place and threatened Myrcella right in front of Tywin. He has serious balls. 
Cersei's exchange with Brienne has made me pretty sure that Jaime will be the valonqar. Like cemented it in my head. 
Jaime with Loras was great. I totally felt the burn.
Margaery's discomfort during Joff's sadistic stunts was beautiful. Natalie Dormer is a fine actress. I was worried when they cast her that all I would see is Anne Boleyn but not so. She was a fantastic Boleyn and she is a fantastic Margaery.
I really, really like the show characterization of QoT and Margaery. For all their schemes, I do think that Margaery's charity is not completely political. She seems much nicer than I thought she was in the books. Granted she is manipulative, but I don't think she's actually despicable. I think this was clear in tonight's episode. She did not seem to have an easy time schooling her expressions of disgust, disdain, and embarrassment at the cruel antics of the king. Does she seem nicer in the show to anyone else? Or is my reading way too colored by Cersei's bullshit paranoia? 
I dunno, I feel like show Margaery is very sympathetic to the less fortunate.
Hmmm what else?
Yes the QoT stole the stone off Sansa's necklace. I do think Margaery was in on it. She would never want to suffer Joffrey and the scenes from last season with the crossbow indicate her willingness to kill him herself if she has to. I kind of think she did it herself. She had the best access to the cup next to Tyrion. It was close to Olenna but wouldn't someone notice if she popped over and mucked with it? I guess perhaps the pie was the diversion though so hmm.
I was concerned going in that two episodes wouldn't do Joff's sadistic nature justice enough to make the ending satisfying. But GRRM did nicely with the script and Jack acted it perfectly. He was absolutely horrible. Beyond disgusting. Like the Hound says, he's "a talker", and what a fitting ending. All the horrible words he's said... he was the perfect victim for the strangler. 
Excellent effects at the end. That was truly gruesome. I would never ever want to die by the strangler. 
I was also underwhelmed by Cersei's reaction. I felt she did not freak out as much as I expected. Which surprised me. However, her accusation was perfect. 
The moment Tywin has always been waiting for: finally, he can be rid of the son he's embarrassed of!
I guess I'm in the minority holding out hope that Bronn doesn't shit on Tyrion because I think Varys was forced to hand Shae over. He's in a foul mood all through the wedding. I mean ALL THROUGH IT. I am thinking this is because he sees the Tyrell/Lannister union to be a stabilizer for the realm (thus in opposition to his own agenda) and maybe also because he had to betray Shae.
All I know is I don't want to hate Bronn.
Seriously, I look for Peter Dinklage to net another couple awards this season. Tyrion is so hurt by everyone in this part of his arc and Peter is already playing the hell out of it. I can't tell if they are going to keep him killing Shae... or have Tywin do it. Either way I think he's going to be miserable. Miserable. He is fantastic. Not at all what I imagined while reading but now I can't read without imagining Dinklage's Tyrion. 
Poor Tyrion. Even Oberyn and Margaery looked sorry for him tonight. 
How awful to be constantly derided and mocked by your own family.
Now... Bran.
Ummmmmm, so his visions are most interesting. There is one that looks like a statue with a crown. In ice. It looks like Joffrey to me but I've seen others say its an Other. Thoughts? 
I find this intriguing and wonder if it is an indication of what "the heart of winter" really is (souls trapped by the Others in an icy hell to power them).
Not much to say about Theon except man he reaped way more than he ever sowed. Death is so much better than degradation and torture.
Stannis I didn't feel as angry with as some seem to. He doesn't seem to enjoy the burnings at all. But of course he needs to defend his actions. He was pretty upset when Selyse's talk turned to Shireen. I like that show Stannis seems far less indifferent to his daughter than book Stannis. And I feel so bad for Shireen. She must be very lonely.
718	Onna Lewyys	2014-04-14	- I didn't know Oberyn was supposed to be Gay/bi? Is that just a twist added by HBO?

From Jaime in ASOS:
"Oberyn Martell? The man's infamous, and not just for poisoning his sword. He has more bastards than Robert, and beds with boys as well."

Based on the promo, it looks like we'll see more of her reaction at the beginning of episode 3, when it picks right back up. And she seems to freak out sufficiently.

720	Honey Badger	2014-04-14	I thought it was a really good episode.Â  As time goes on the show will probably have more and more divergences from the books, which is fine by me.Â  I'm starting to like the show better than the books, or at least Feast and Dance which were mediocre to me.Â  The first trilogy I still prefer over the show.
Â 
I like how they handled the QoT palming the gem and passing it off with a "plonk."Â  I knew as it was happening but still didn't catch the sleight of hand.Â  Really well done.Â  A second viewing caught it though.Â  It's ballsy as they could have shot that scene wrong and gave it away to viewers.Â 
Â 
Jack G as Joffrey went out like a champ.Â  Gruesome death and as I imagined it in the books.Â  Blood flowing everywhere with spittle and purple face.Â  Nice makeup effects and the actor sold it so well.Â  Good luck to him in his future exploits beyond acting.
Â 
I'm surprised at those complaining Stannis burned his brother-in-law.Â  Seems in line with him burning the fake King Beyond the Wall.Â  The Red God is pretty brutal and Stannis/Mel were willing to sacrifice people in the books, so this is just a different trajectory on the show but still somewhat similar.Â  My suspicion with the mythology is that followers of the Red God misread the omens and he is in fact the Devil, not God.Â  So even if Stannis is successful, he will have been a devil worshiper.Â

I did not know who Sigur Ros was until reading about them in these ep 02 threads.Â  When the Rains was being played over the end credits, the non-falsetto of Birgisson really has a timbre similar to Gleeson's voice. I can't speak for any other pieces JA3nsi sings but I could picture that being Jack singing.

Yeah, picked up on that too. It's too good of a line to not fit in there somehow. My guess is Varys asking what happened in the Tower of the Hand, to which Tyrion replies along the lines of "Turns out my father does not shit gold after all".

Heh. So no Pretty Pig (or Crunch), I assume. Penny and Tyrion could just do the jousts with horse costumes the way they used in them in this episode, though. Or Tyrion could learn some other kind of performing skill from Penny (there have been a few references to juggling).

I disagree with you about the overall episode though, thought everything was done at a high level. Consigning half the episode to the wedding was important as well, and they seemed to include just about everything from Tyrion's chapter in the books.
734	Bonzo	2014-04-14	I thought that scene between Locke and Ramsay was interesting. IIRC, it's noted in the books (ADwD I think) that House Locke dislike Ramsay Snow. Remember in ADwD Old Lord Locke and Wyman Manderley are eating merrily and japing together? I wonder than if Locke in the show only feigns friendship with Ramsay when in truth he actually despises him, or whether he and Ramsay are actually just two peas in a pod, and consequently will fight for and defend House Bolton no matter what. Truly an interesting development.
Â 
FWIW, from what I've gathered through the rumour mill Locke will be sent north to the wall.Â 
Â 
So...thoughts?
735	Mr. Sven	2014-04-14	Â 
My guess is Varys, Bronn mentions Varys in the scene, I think.

I really disliked this. Â Back to Shae Superwoman Whore. Â She loves Tyrion and WTF? He thinks it's better to tell her he wants her to leave because she's a whore instead of to save her life? Â When did he get this stupid?


Â 
Earlier in the episode Tywin says to bring Shae to his tower before the wedding
736	Mr. Sven	2014-04-14	Â 
yes, i was wondering about that. "i saw her to the ship and i wasn't followed." Â  Â yeah, right.
Â 
anyway, i don't like how they played that scene, it felt really unrealistic to have shae crying while tyrion's lying. the whole thing didn't flow, imho. but they had to get shae to turn somehow.

If he'd lived in the North the last 18 years, you'd think he'd have heard of Ned Stark's bastard. But if he's only been there a handful of years, maybe...Or they're just being strange.

I've heard some suggest that Locke will take the role of Bowen Marsh, but I find that extremely unlikely (and would totally undermine the Julias Caesar moment it was in the books).

747	The Taxman	2014-04-14	Did anyone else notice how in the scene with Bronn Jaime was holding Oathkeeper in his hand at the beginning, in the next scene as he is walking over to pick up the blunt practice sword it has magically disappeared? Glaring continuity error.
Â 
This episode left me a bit disappointed, so many scenes that either seemed pointless, wrong or could have been done much better.


Â 
The Oathkeeper is still there in the scene, just off to the side from where you think Jaime dropped it.Â
748	Woman of War	2014-04-14	And darkside Tyrion discarding Shae. That's going to be ugly. 
Wasn't it sort of the emotional equivalent of Arya chucking rocks at Nymeria to drive her off, though? I don't think he would have told her any of that unless he thought it was the only way to sever the relationship.You are right, Newstar, with your answer.
Would Shae have listened if once again Tyrion had talked about the danger?
And the way Tyrion did this it would have been easier for her to forget faithless Tyrion in the future, not the concerned lover sacrificing his happiness for her safety but the arrogant nobleman sending his whore away. I guess once again Tyrion was thinking around one corner too much with his attempt at being evil. 
And now we will see an Othello-like tragical misunderstanding when Shae dies, making Tyrion maybe darker than in the books because he won't listen when he should have??
I tremendously enjoyed Margaery!
You could see everything, everything in her face, disgust, false laughter, attempt at distraction and worry. That so very clever young woman! Dorner was extraordinary, just like Diana Rigg!
And I really loved Turner. I have not been a fan of Sansa so far but Turner's acting in the two first episodes has impressed me and starts to win me over for Sansa. She has a brain, she is furious, she makes her standpoint clear, is full of pity and now her play shows that she has a clear understanding of the subtleties and power games that are going on. "And now we have a new Queen", her voice got so wonderfully cynical. Her face showed every memory of her father's beheading at the dwarf jousting and shame about Tyrion's treatment.
 And the solidarity she showed to Tyrion when she passed the goblet, two victims of Joffrey and yet proud, full of understanding for each other, great acting.

749	smithy	2014-04-14	I liked the episode ,usually when a episode is hyped like this was ( among fans at least ) i'm left slightly underwhelmed but I really enjoyed this episode , I liked the Ramsay hunt , I loved Bran's visions and the wedding wasn't a let down for me at least , I really liked the Oberyn / Tywin , Cersei scene with the veiled threat to Myrcella and they nailed Joff's death ,his face made it look horrific and super painful , the only bits I didn't like were the visit to Dragonstone and what the heck happened to little cute Tommen , where did that little tubby Joffrey lookalikey come from Â :<
750	UK Mord	2014-04-14	So please fill me as i won't get to watch until it airs in the UK tonight.
Did the episode stop dead (excuse the pun) at Joffrey's choking or do we get to see a distraught Cersei? 
I'm looking forward to my friends reactions who are non book readers but love the show.
751	Funkagenda	2014-04-14	Amazing episode! _O_ Â Wedding was great, I wonder what non book readers will think of this. Dreadfort was also great and the talking metween Tywon and Oberyn as well.Â
752	Queen of Whores	2014-04-14	Did the episode stop dead (excuse the pun) at Joffrey's choking or do we get to see a distraught Cersei?

It ended with Cersei shouting for Tyrion to be arrested, and her distraught face as she looks down at Joffrey's corpse.

754	Rhasgul	2014-04-14	Do you guys reckon Pycelle was meant to return to the feast after delivering the message to the kitchens? Even tho Cersei stated he had to leave the feast, that she could do horrible things to him? Don't know exactly, noticed him sitting next to Varys and just wondered, might be an inconsistency

Â 
I noticed that too. I'm just gonna toss it up to an inconsistency. I doubt he got to the kitchens and got back in that time. I also took Cersei's threat to imply she didn't want him to come back to the feast, and Pycelle doesn't strike me as the type to outright disobey Cersei (or any Lannister) like that.

I was just about to sing praises to Natalie Dorner. Absolutely fantastic in this episode.
Â 
As for Sansa, I'm glad she and Tyrion had a slightly nice last moment (her handing him the cup). It was a good conclusion for them, and went along with the whole Show!Sansa bending at the wedding.
758	Vegeta_Greyjoy	2014-04-14	Meanwhile on Dragonstone...man, they needed to either cut 2 minutes or add a couple to those scenes. Seeing Stannis & Mel act awkward at the supper table because Selyse is a nutter does nothing for the plot, plus it's just more of the same, and undermines Mel's creepiness the following scene.
759	boojam	2014-04-14	I don't think Locke is a member of House Locke. I think it's his first name. I also am not sure he's actually supposed to be a Northman, since he has no clue who Jon Snow is.I'm tempted to think he's a sellsword from somewhether other than the North, who's only relatively recently established himself in the North and the Dreadfort. If he'd lived in the North the last 18 years, you'd think he'd have heard of Ned Stark's bastard. But if he's only been there a handful of years, maybe...Or they're just being strange.Since Locke does not exist in the book I think either D&D outlined for George or D&D flat wrote that scene.D&D inserted a scene in Blackwater that GRRM said he didn't write.Can't now figure out what Locke's plot purpose is?(Now.)He going to the most dangerous place , Castle Black, in Westeros at the worst time.I am guessing the Wilding crew south of Wall are going to kill him and his party.

763	Conchobar	2014-04-14	I still don't understand how Olenna knew Joffrey would drink from that cup and not Marg,( or anyone other than Joffrey ). It seemed like it was by chance that Tyrion picked that cup up and gave it to Joff.

769	Sun	2014-04-14	Re. the dragon vision: I believe it is likely Â an image from the past telling Bran that the dragons have returned to the world. That they exist once again and are a threat. That is all. It is not a vision from the future, it is from the past foreboding a present and future threat.Â
770	Rockroi	2014-04-14	Yeah it's a White Walker, and it looks like he's smashing up some blue crystal meth shards

Couldn't that reflection be Bloodraven? Â I think he had two (blue) eyes, but its still possible. Â
771	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-14	So did Bronn lie to Tyrion and actually hand over Shae to Cersei?


Â 
I'm curious for that as well. I didn't expect that Bronn would outright betray Tyrion like that by handing her over, however it would be a major deviation to actually send her away. The only other explanation would be that she did go, but found a way to get back onto land before the ship departed. The fact that it wasn't shown onscreen though is likely an indicator that something happened which they want us to be surprised by.

772	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-14	So did Bronn lie to Tyrion and actually hand over Shae to Cersei?


Â 
From what I gathered, no. Bronn mentioned he was followed, but he/they believed it was just Varys since he was in on the plan as well. But since we know Tywin ordered Shae to be taken after Cersei pointed her out to him, I think it's safe to say that Bronn believed Shae was safely away before Cersei's people nabbed her.
773	Nictarion	2014-04-14	Re. the dragon vision: I believe it is likely Â an image from the past telling Bran that the dragons have returned to the world. That they exist once again and are a threat. That is all. It is not a vision from the future, it is from the past foreboding a present and future threat.Â I definitely felt it was a vision of the future, as was the the throne room of the red keep being destroyed from above, and seeing snow fall through.
774	JesterX	2014-04-14	Sorry if someone mentioned this already, since this topic is so big . .Â .Â  Anyone notice the foreshadowing for Tywin when Olenna told him that he should try to enjoy things?Â  Ala Shae ending up in his bed.
Â 
I really think HBO is going to be a lot more graphic than the books.Â  We're gonna find Tywin and Shae all up in each other's arms.Â  I don't think Tyrion will be finding him on the privy.
775	White Harbors Wrath	2014-04-14	I know these threads are equally for fun and speculation as well as discussion, but man...some of you REALLY reach with the foreshadowing.
Â 
Really good episode...my biggest gripe is Brans wig doesn't seem to be growing as quickly as he is.
776	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-14	I definitely felt it was a vision of the future, as was the the throne room of the red keep being destroyed from above, and seeing snow fall through.


Â 
I'd agree with that. Interesting to see them giving very strong hints as to what will probably happen in the future books at some point.
777	pwnt	2014-04-14	I thought the episode was really well done; I loved the Dreadfort scenes with Ramsay, Roose, Reek.Â  Ramsay is badass and I can't wait until the scene where he skins Jon Snow alive.Â  I knew the scene was coming when poor Joff got poisoned, but I still cried, just like when I read it in the book.Â  He was my favorite character and part of me wishes that I had written ASOFAI because I would have made a grown up Joffrey the hero at the end of it all and he would adorn the iron throne with the heads of all the evil characters (I always pictured Dany's skull with the white hair still attached to it, lol, at the very top of the throne).Â  Anyway, it's up to Ramsay now to save Westeros!
778	Natalie Underfoot	2014-04-14	Overall a really good episode. Our HBOGO feed went out at like 40 minutes into the episode and my unsullied Husband grabbed his phone and I practically yelled at him to drop it cause I knew he was just going on twitter.
Â 
I felt like there was good reason for Brienne not to talk to Sansa, she paid her respect to the married couple and just bolted out of there. Â Until Cersei, on her rampage of verbal terror got to her. I don't mind her and Jamie being at KL earlier and I do wish we had more Jamie expression but they seemed to intent on showing the damage to Joffrey's face that I feel both him and Cersei got cheated out of having better reactions. Â I feel like they rushed through that part just to have her hurry up and accuse Tyrion.
Â 
My dad and husband are both Unsullied and they both think it was the pie and my dad has the killer as the Tyrell family and my husband just knows it's not Tyrion and even wondered if it was Tywin as he finds him tragic but competent.
Â 
I mentioned some of the deviations Â in the Stannis storyline and my husband seems to feel it comes across pretty clear that Stannis is not a believer but that he feels that if her magic works than he'll deal with it.Â 
Â 
As far as whether or not Penny exists. Since a big part in the book was that her brother was killed and she attack Tyrion my guess is that if they cut that out they may not eliminate the Penny character as much as introduce her in another way. Â Although I feel that if Shae does just end up going where whores go they may just eliminate Penny all together and play up Tyrion and Jorah. I do feel that mostly the whole point of Penny's character was to re-humanize Tyrion after her leaves Kings Landing. Â To be honest. I think I'd much prefer a Tyrion-Jorah match-up if Jorah is less melancholy and more angry and determined in the show.
779	boojam	2014-04-14	So did Bronn lie to Tyrion and actually hand over Shae to Cersei?Â I am not so sure anymore, in the promo for the next episode it looks kind of like she was not fully informed on what was going on.I don't think that is in the book.So it's odd for the QoT to take such a chance.

Because she has to be around to give testimony condemning Tyrion in 4x0_ (4x06 or 4x07, I'm guessing), something she can hardly do if she's chilling in Pentos.

785	Runaway Bunny	2014-04-14	How did Ramsay trust Theon enough to shave his neck? Doesn't Theon want to die anyway?

Geez, what are you supposed to do when someone's choking to the point of bleeding out their eyes and nose? Jaime tried to do whatever he could in that situation, while Cersei was just in pure shock. I don't know how anyone could dispute Lena's acting there; she went wild at the end of it. She literally spat at the guards to seize Tyrion.

Â 
It doesn't seem possible to tell, because the gem holder on the left is obscured by sansa's braid/outfit in all of her scenes wearing it in the episode and it could be the way the necklace was designed. There is no gem in the right holder, though, that much is certain. Mayhaps a screenshot of the necklace when Dontos offers it to her, pre-wedding?
804	White Harbors Wrath	2014-04-14	Â

The jewel on the far left could also be missing since it's obscured - so it looks like the necklace could just not have been made with gems on either side.
806	rmholt	2014-04-14	Â 
This didn't make sense to me in the show or the book. Why doesn't Olenna just keep the poison on her? What was the point of having Sansa smuggle it in? Were people being patted down as they went in? I just don't get it.

Possibly because they set up Sansa's disappearance - with the evidence - as well. Can't be too careful.  In the book and so far in the show she still has extra stones - or are they more poison?! - but not clear if GRRM did this on purpose.

Not enough visually to go on.
Â 
The jewel on the far left could also be missing since it's obscured - so it looks like the necklace could just not have been made with gems on either side.


Â 
I think it's enough to go on...especially because then as Olenna is walking to her seat, you hear an audible "plink" right as she passes Margery. The only thing that I can't find is Margery slipping into Joff's cup, but we see her handle his cup right before he cuts the cake, and she was sitting next to him all wedding. I haven't had time for a proper rewatch yet, so maybe it's in there somewhere.
Â 
I doubt the Unsullied caught any of this, which is why I'm assuming next episode it will be made explicit.

Geez, what are you supposed to do when someone's choking to the point of bleeding out their eyes and nose? Jaime tried to do whatever he could in that situation, while Cersei was just in pure shock. I don't know how anyone could dispute Lena's acting there; she went wild at the end of it. She literally spat at the guards to seize Tyrion.


Â 
Lots of comments on the lack of an anguished wail from Cersei.Â  I missed it too.Â  I feltÂ  real sympathy for her during this scene in the book.Â  I also thought it would be a good parallel with Catelyn's cry when Robb is killed--two mothers, two screams.Â  In fact, that would have been a good way to end the episode and save the accusations for episode 3.Â  However, perhaps they were trying to show the difference between Cat and Cersei.Â  Cat goes into a stupor at her son's death and Cersei springs into action/accusation to bring his "murderer" to justice.Â  Works both ways.
815	boojam	2014-04-14	Why does it arbitrarily have to be one certain dragon then?Right.Since it's just a vision why does it have to be realistic at all?

Â 
Bran's vision was a call to join the 3EC along with a an account of dangers,Â threats and calamities that have come to pass for Bran, and some that are yet to come.Â 
Â 
1- A sword and Eddard Stark (self-explanatory)
2- A crow flies through the crypts.
2- Bran pushed out of the tower with Cersie's voice in the background (Bran never knew who pushed him).
3- The Others: the child from the pilot (past), the zombie horse from season 2 (past & future), a reflection of a WW in ice (future).
4- Snow in the throne room (future).
5- Dragons over Kings Landing in summer (past vision foretelling of a present & future threat).
Â 
If this vision is relevant in anyway, I believe it is relevant in that it tells us that the 3EC sees the dragons as much of a threat as the Others.Â

I've heard some suggest that Locke will take the role of Bowen Marsh, but I find that extremely unlikely.


On Locke: after this episode, I'm assuming that he's not joining the Night's Watch, but is rather going to the Wall as a visitor, much like Tyrion back in Season 1. He'll be looking for signs of the Stark boys, and possibly hoping for a chance to assassinate Jon Snow as well. In retrospect I'm surprised this wasn't suggested as a possibility here on the forums (or if it was, I didn't notice): Bolton needs a hunt for Bran and Rickon. Locke was first introduced as his best hunter. And we saw clips of Locke at the Wall, which is after all the obvious destination for Bran and Rickon.
Â 
Lots of story potential. Barbecue opportunity for the Thenns; a chance for Alliser Throne to look badass and say something like "Yeah, we want to hang Jon Snow, but he's OURS to hang, so you can just eff off". Who knows - maybe Locke will "volunteer" to help Jon and others attack Craster's, and thereby hope to get his hands on Bran. It could affect whether or not Sam tells Jon about Bran, although for that to happen the timeline would get a bit odd (not exactly unprecedented on the show!). At the moment I like Locke's story simply because it adds an element of uncertainty in the north.
Â 
At the moment I see Locke being killed by a White Walker, but I have absolutely no reason for thinking that.
Â 
I think the shared torture congratulations with Ramsey have pretty much demonstrated we're not going to be seeing Locke as a more sympathetic character.
825	gregg22	2014-04-14	Â 
Â no, we all don't know it's not Tyrion...some people do, some don't.Â  People watching the show who have never read the books may not have any clue there could be someone other than Tyrion - especially since (as things stand right now) there were no gems mising from Sansa's necklace


Â 
We all know it wasn't Tyrion. The show clearly portrays that. He has a genuine look of shock on his face, and he would never have picked up the murder weapon after (the cup) if it was him. The best part of the scene is when he picks up the cup, not realizing what is about to happen to him, Then instantly he feels Cersei's accusatory eyes on him, and realizes, I picked up the murder weapon, I am about to become a patsy.
826	FakeJaqenH'ghar	2014-04-14	At the breakfast, what did Tywin say to Cersei after she mentioned Shae's true identity? I believe it was something along the lines of ".......in the tower of the hand" but I missed the first part of his line.

Oberyn needs much more facetime while still among the living.Â  It's going to suck when he dies (as it did in the books), but he is just so awesome badassery - I love his threats to the Lannisters.Â  His fight against the Mountain is going to be epic.Agreed! Not so much facetime yet as there was in the books.  We should see more now as I believe much of the season will be about tyrion, and oberyn and tyrion have many convos. But at this point in the book they had several as well. Surprised they didnt do those on the show.  Probably just time constraints.  This show should really be two hours long!
830	gregg22	2014-04-14	My unspoiled sister picked up on Olenna right away.Â

Â 
Exactly the gem is missing from the far right side right where Olenna touched it.
Â 
My wife hasn't read the books either, and said it was Olenna right away (or "the old lady"), but she didn't see the slight of hand.
Â 
Other non-readers I talked to all said it was obvious it wasn't Tyrion. These are people that can't even remember the characters' names. I think they tried to make it rather obvious that Tyrion is a patsy.

I don't think most non-readers will pick up on HOW it was done, but I think they have an idea as to who.Â
831	Colonel Green	2014-04-14	While there are still Shae scenes to come, at this point I can say that the writers aren't handling the downfall of the show's version of the Tyrion/Shae relationship very well. The whole thing is monumentally contrived, and the addition of the Shae/Sansa interactions has ended up being as irrelevant as I thought it was all along.

They don't want it on any of them in case things go wrong and the mission has to be aborted/gets found out before they get their chance.Â  Not only must they kill Joffrey, but they must kill him in such a way that someone else looks guilty and House Tyrell is above and beyond even the hint of suspicion.Â  [So in case they miss their chance, they can get another.]
Â 
They want it on them for as short a time as possible, and they want it in play for as short a time as possible, so that Marge doesn't have to avoid drinking from Joffrey's goblet for a conspicuous amount of time.

846	MyLittleDirewolf	2014-04-14	Yeah I think that's it.Â  The QoT and Maggie were willing to let Sansa and Tyrion get slaughtered in order to secure the throne.Â  Pretty ruthless.Â  Funny how Littlefinger had other plans.
Â 

Right? That's why I've never understood people who think Sansa and Marg were friends/will be friends in the future, write fanfics with Sansa marrying Willas, etc. The Tyrells totally threw her under the bus. Marg might have superficially liked Sansa and felt sorry for her, but still set her up (with LF's help) to take the blame for poisoning Joffrey.
847	Hath4	2014-04-14	well to be fair the situation was never presented to him in the book. Ramsay gravitates to people that share his mindset. If a girl came to him and liked his pycho style he would probably be interested in her as an assistant.Â myranda has stayed alive by being pycho.

I always read the book passages that their goal was that it appear natural, not that it be a poisoning or that Sansa be blamed, or even Tyrion. Â Of course they would arrange it so that they were not directly involved in any of the chain of events...but I don't know that this means they ever intended for Tyrion and Sansa to be accused.

859	Tori Targaryen	2014-04-14	The dragon image isn't meant to be a literal event.

Have to point out it appeared to be 'summery'). Or, it could be in relation to The Three Eyed Crow and his heritage.

861	lostinasia	2014-04-14	Honest question about books and show both: is there any possibility of a two-part poison, where two ingredients need to be combined to kill? In other stories that's often how would-be killers protect themselves. Or if there's an antidote that Margaery had already taken?
Â 
(Written as someone who still isn't quite sure what happened in the books either.)
862	darksellsword	2014-04-14	From reading the books I always suspected that It was Tywin that poisoned Joffrey , and from their interactions
in the show especially season 3 I am even more convinced.If you look at it logically who has the most to gain from
the results of his death. Joffrey was out of control and Cersei challenged Tywin to try and control him.Jaime is commander
and personal body guard to Joffrey so he would naturally assume that Cersei would blame him and a rift would form between
them.The fact Tyrion was accused could of been Â something he planned for as well, he was well aware that cersei hates him
almost as much as he does.The result he splits Jaime and cersei up returning his Son and heir to Casterley rock to marry
and continue the lannister line .He gets rid of a Tyrant king replaces him with his nicer grandson Tommen and has his dwarf son executed.Its a win win win situation for him.
863	jons nissa	2014-04-14	Â 



Â 
I've always thought that Tywin must have secretly been quite relieved that Joffrey was dead. Â Joffrey grown into adulthood with total power was a scary prospect; Joffrey would have had no qualms about killing Lannisters, including Tywin himself.


Â 
i agree that tywin was worried about joff and must have been relieved somewhat at his death given there was a second son to assume the throne. but there was the sharp lesson he was planning on teaching joff. i've always wondered about that but sharp lesson or not, in the end, tywin would have lost control of joffrey given his trajectory.
Â 


Selyse: Their souls are with our Lord now. Their sins are burned away. Did you see?
Davis: I'm sure they're more than grateful, my Queen.
And, uh . . . Was Mel sitting at the head of the table facing Stannis?


Â 
as jon said, we all know who stannis' real queen is.
Â 


Â 
Also, that whole convo with Bran about how he'll forget Winterfell and his familiy if he stays in his wolf for too long made me worry about Jon...I think the personality changes in him after he's resurrected are going to be more drastic than some people are anticipating.Â  Maybe some Lord Beric style memory problems.


Â 
i'm worried about jon too. i always expected jon's personality to change but i wonder if there haven't been a few hints that he might live in ghost too long and become a shadow of what he was.Â 
Â

Was it just me or did the blood drain from Brienne's face as Cersei continued to stare at her silently? Then you have Jaime glancing over at them and probably thinking "OMG every fantasy I ever wanted!!!"Â 


Â 
i kind of thought those glances from jaime showed worry and i doubt it was cersei he thought was getting harassed. and yes, poor brienne, but i don't believe cersei had enough on her to make that claim so she was clearly fishing and brienne bit. poor girl.

Lack of anguished wail = shock =/= not loving her child. Loved that scene, great acting, wouldn't mind something more intense, but no problem.


Â 
Agreed (on your equation).Â  I did like the wail in the books because 1) it was a reminder that even someone as evil as Joff can be loved and 2) Cersei is generally restrained in her public emotions prior to the PW, and I liked the lack of control in her reaction.Â  But yeah, I can move on now.Â  Really looking forward to the trial, etc.
865	boojam	2014-04-14	And apparently I literally need a new TV because the resolution isn't showing this, but I've seen the screen capture.Â  Still bummed though that it wasn't a purple amethyst.Yeah, that seemed such a simple thing for the prop department to come up with.
866	Cas Stark	2014-04-14	Yeah, that seemed such a simple thing for the prop department to come up with.


Â 
Â 
Agree, it's a TOTAL nitpick, but why not purple, and for that matter, why not a hairnet. Â The idea that she's going to realistically have a huge gemstone on her necklace missing and no one notice it....seems fairly unlikely.

Â 
Except that nobody's going to bother to look at Sansa.Â  She's off to the side (literally at the end of the table, nobody's on her left) and the King's speech, the joust, and the pie presentation are all happening in the center.
Â 
Except Margaery, who keeps checking out Sansa's reaction to the offensive dwarf joust.Â  Or maybe she's looking for... something else 
Â 
Security is lax at Joffrey's wedding (hence showing us that half-assed security meeting with Joff, Jaime, and Trant last week).Â  Nobody's anticipating an assassination plot, certainly not a poison one. [There's no Royal Food Taster!Â  Show or Book!Â  Talk about lax!]Â  We only know to look for a missing gem on Sansa's attire because we have foreknowledge.
Â 


The Tyrell's didn't care if she got caught after the deed was done.


Â 
Also this.Â  In fact, they're better served if she does get caught because it takes suspicion off of them.Â

869	White Harbors Wrath	2014-04-14	...and with all the stuff going on...no one on earth would be looking for peoples with missing gemstones on their necklaces, hairnets, rings or brooches. It's very likely that it would go completely unnoticed. We know it should be missing...who at the wedding is going to go "stop...nobody move!...someone here must have slipped a poison gemstone into the kings wine! check everyone's necklaces!"
Â 
They could safely assume Tyrion slipped him something but jumping to the conclusion that it was a poison gemstone?
870	Colonel Green	2014-04-14	From reading the books I always suspected that It was Tywin that poisoned Joffrey


That makes no sense whatsoever, and you would have to completely ignore the actual events.Â  If Tywin wanted rid of Joffrey, there were a million was to do it that didn't needlessly squander strategic assets like Sansa (whose loss makes a ruin of Tywin's Northern dynastic strategy).
871	Cas Stark	2014-04-14	That makes no sense whatsoever, and you would have to completely ignore the actual events.Â  If Tywin wanted rid of Joffrey, there were a million was to do it that didn't needlessly squander strategic assets like Sansa (whose loss makes a ruin of Tywin's Northern dynastic strategy).


Â 
Never mind, you know, that he started a war over the dwarf son he despises....but he's going to murder his grandson, LOL, who can quite easily dope up on milk of the poppy for the forseeable future if the sharp lesson doesn't bring him in line. Â But, people have all kinds of whacked out theories.
872	ovis alba	2014-04-14	Â 
I'm sorry. Â But I have to ask.
Â 
Why couldn't Olenna simply just carry the poison herself? Â 


Â 
In the books I always wondred if the Tyrells and Littlefinger made the plan together and Littlefinger agreed to use Sansa so she could get blamed afterwards so the Tyrells and him would be safe (she sure has enough reason to do so), but it might have fitted LF to have his very own plans in addition, which was not only killing Joffrey, but also getting Sansa out, not caring who gets blamed in the end, because he and Sansa are gone and he doesn't need the Tyrells anymore.Â
873	LifeRuiner	2014-04-14	One thing I didn't like was the girl with Ramsay. I think it detracts from his character. Ramsay does not respect women enough to have one as a partner in sadistic crime. She will probably turn out to be a great character and add to the show, which is cool and all, but they shouldn't have done that.


Â 
That's how I felt as well.Â
874	Conchobar	2014-04-14	Honest question about books and show both: is there any possibility of a two-part poison, where two ingredients need to be combined to kill? In other stories that's often how would-be killers protect themselves. Or if there's an antidote that Margaery had already taken?
Â 
(Written as someone who still isn't quite sure what happened in the books either.)


Very interesting! But I don't think so, I am sure we would have been made aware of that to some degree in the books if it was a thing.
875	MarieAntoinette	2014-04-14	Wow, I feel this episode went by really fast. First of all, Jack Gleeson did an awesome job bringingÂ  Joffrey to life throughout theÂ  seasons of GOT, he was in top form during his scenes at the wedding too, I'll miss him.The make-up department did a great job with his face, it looked quite gruesome. I was a bit underwhelmed by Cersei's display of grief, I thought she would be a little more expressive. Edit: I have just watched the preview for Episode 3, and that part with Cersei screaming is more like I expected that she would react. So maybe it was just postponed to the next episode.
Â 
Things I loved:
Loras and his reply to Jaime and him storming off at the wedding feast
Oberyn and his exchange with Cersei and Tywin. Ellaria Sand looked great.
The war of the five kings played out by the dwarfs. This was far better and more cruel than the book scence. Poor Sansa! I really felt for her when theÂ  Robb Stark dwarf lost his "head".
The QoT shouting and her unconvincing "Help poor Joffrey", this made me chuckle
Â 
The execution by fire made me very uncomfortable. I absolutely hate religious fanaticism, this scene was hard to watch. This is more a personal preference than a nitpick, but the actor playing Ramsay does nothing for me. I can't stand his voice and demeanor, and I don't like that he has a girl sidekick.Â  I was impressed with the performance of Alfie Allen though and loved that we got to see Fat Walda.

876	Impfan	2014-04-14	Please, let's stop all the nonsensical fantasies about Olenna somehow getting the poison from Sansa's necklace. Â The close up only shows her hand on a stone; it does not show the stone removed from Sansa's necklace. Â It never was. Â Removal would have required much more force than could have been done in a subtle way. Â I think the whole Sansa necklace gambit is a teaser put in by either or both of GRRM and D&D. Â I think Dontos imploring Sansa to get away to save her life is part of this con. Â How did Dontos know at this point that Joff was even dead. Â Anybody who thinks the whole "Here, Sansa, please take my mother's necklace" crap is part of some conspiracy with Olenna is out of their minds. Â She'd never trust somebody like Dontos Â as a co-conspirator. Â 
Â 
I can only imagine the Olenna?Dontos/Sanas scenario if it was cooked up by Olenna as one of two alternative strategies for get the good stuff into Joff's cup. Â It was probably a back-up to the main plot: Â put the poison into Margery's wedding necklace and get it from there at the opportune moment. Â Sansa/Dontos was just a hedge.
Â 
Why do you think the QofT was so obsessed with Margery's wedding necklace in Ep.401? Â It was so she could get one she could jury-rig it with a poisoned jewel easily removable at the right time. Â  Olenna could not have assumed she'd have a chance to get the poison into Joff's cup without involving Margery in some way. Â Margery put the cup in front of the QofT when she had the chance andÂ voila!
Â 
I watched the Sansa/OofT interaction at eh wedding many times. Â I didnt see Olenna remove one of the jewels from Sansa's necklace. Â Maybe she did but you really can't tell.
877	NightStark	2014-04-14	Â 
I watched the Sansa/OofT interaction at eh wedding many times. Â I didnt see Olenna remove one of the jewels from Sansa's necklace. Â Maybe she did but you really can't tell.

All the stones were there...she touched a stone...then that stone clearly disappeared.
Yeah you can't tell at all.
878	Conchobar	2014-04-14	Yeah for some reason I can't take Ramsay as seriously now that he has a female sidekick. It would have been better if it was a group of men around his age, his so called "buddies" who are actually just terrified of him.
879	NightStark	2014-04-14	Woman adds an extra dynamic to it because people don't expect that sort of cruelty from a woman.
880	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-04-14	...and with all the stuff going on...no one on earth would be looking for peoples with missing gemstones on their necklaces, hairnets, rings or brooches.

Â 
Precisely. Â We all knew what we were looking for, and I'm not aware of a single person who noticed the QoT pluck or plant the stone without the assistance of slo-motion instant replay.
Â 
Â 


Â 
They don't want it on any of them in case things go wrong and the mission has to be aborted/gets found out before they get their chance.Â  Not only must they kill Joffrey, but they must kill him in such a way that someone else looks guilty and House Tyrell is above and beyond even the hint of suspicion.Â  [So in case they miss their chance, they can get another.]
Â 
They want it on them for as short a time as possible, and they want it in play for as short a time as possible, so that Marge doesn't have to avoid drinking from Joffrey's goblet for a conspicuous amount of time.


Â 
Fair point, but doesn't the act of planting it on Sansa prior to and then retrieving it during the ceremony expose her to much more risk? Â It seems like the odds of her screwing up her slight-of-hand magic trick in front of thousands of people are much greater than an old lady being frisked by the completely uninterested gold cloaks. Â She can integrate a poison stone into a piece of jewelry but she can't sew a hidden pocket?
881	boojam	2014-04-14	Also this.Â  In fact, they're better served if she does get caught because it takes suspicion off of them.In the book Sansa and Dontos have this long set up of her escape, tho she apparently does not figure out what is going on.So LF HAD to know way ahead of time what was going down ... frankly I can't remember his direct involvement in the book, seems to be there.He knew that Sansa would have to be saved and what better way than the wedding poisoning riot?Anyway it was Dontos who gave Sansa (the hairnet in the book), which points to even more LF involvement.I don't think it's happened in the books yet has it?, that it is found out that Sansa is at the Eyrie with LF.Bingo! LF implicated again!

It just makes it all a bit more interesting, don't read too much into it.
883	Ho Ho Hodor	2014-04-14	I always felt that the TyrellsÂ didn't want sansa caught so they could continue the original plan and marry her to Willas.. I feel they wanted either Tyrion or Oberyn to get the blame 100% so they could get her reign in the North just my thoughts... she was just an easy way to smuggle the strangler in
Â 
Im kind of sad at how blunt theyre making the show the vagueness and open ended events are what makes me so drawn to the books... in the preview for next week it looks like QoT and Marg are talking about how they did it when in the books it was LFs suggestion (and the end of that chapter just blew my mind the first time I read it when he introduces the "game")
Â 
The Shae deal is just boring and you can see that theyre just setting her up to testify at the trial.. Bran seems so emo right now to me just brooding while he eats his bread but the weirwood tree prophecy was pretty cool
Â 
it was a great idea that they have Reek shaving Ramsay while he learns of Robbs death but I would atleast like to have seen 1 finger gone or something... at least he was limping while he ran
Â 
that scene between Tywin/Cersei and Oberyn/Elaria was so rushed and fast! I could hardly understand what they were saying... im betting they were short on time but I feel like that scene could have been awesome if they slowed it down and let Oberyn be more subtle and cool about it
Â 
Stannis loves Shereen which im glad they emphasized there and Mel is crazy but Celese is just bat shit crazy.. between her and Lysa idk who is crazier (kind of sad she doesn't have a mustache or prominent ears)Â
884	Impfan	2014-04-14	Olenna either broght the poison to the wedding on her person or she had it in Margery's necklace. Â The Sansa theory would have been far to risky and difficult. Â Margery had to be in on it.

The Lannisters wouldn't have let her go that easy, they'd have married her to Daven or somebody even though he's probably tied down to the Freys by now.
886	darksellsword	2014-04-14	That makes no sense whatsoever, and you would have to completely ignore the actual events.Â  If Tywin wanted rid of Joffrey, there were a million was to do it that didn't needlessly squander strategic assets like Sansa (whose loss makes a ruin of Tywin's Northern dynastic strategy).

Tyrion clearly wasn't willing to rape sansa as Tywin wanted or produce an heir any time soon.It is perfectly plausible that Tywin found out about the promise Tyrion Â made to Sansa. He may of intended Jaime to marry Sansa after Tyrion was killed. Â I don't think milk of the poppy would of solved the Joffrey problem he was the king you can't circumvent his Authority all of the time.

So it was a production oversight that a stone was missing.
Even though we know a stone was also gone from the hairnet in the books.
Plus the Ghost of High Heart described a young girl. with fangs dripping poison in her hair..Sansa's hairnet from the books.
A hairnet that was replaced in the show with a necklace...a necklace that is now missing a stone.

889	raj34	2014-04-14	Â 
From what I gathered, no. Bronn mentioned he was followed, but he/they believed it was just Varys since he was in on the plan as well. But since we know Tywin ordered Shae to be taken after Cersei pointed her out to him, I think it's safe to say that Bronn believed Shae was safely away before Cersei's people nabbed her.


Â 
I hope you're right. I would be seriously bummed if D&D have Bronn betray Tyrion like that.
890	gregg22	2014-04-14	Â 
I'm sorry. Â But I have to ask.
Â 
Why couldn't Olenna simply just carry the poison herself? Â 


Â 
I thought the same. The only thing i can think of is that it would be way too risky for the QoT to attempt to acquire poison in Kings Landing. Remember Littlefinger has a role in orchestrating this .
Â 
Besides, there is definitely an attempt by the show to imply that this scheme happened in this way. The first Dontos scene of season has the sole purpose of giving Sansa the necklace (no mention of him helping her escape as in the books). Olenna clearly handles the necklace, and appears to be palming something. She is the closest to the cup right before Joff gets the fatal sip, and they make point to show her face right as Tyrion grabs the cup to hand it to Joff. Joff drops dead, and Dontos suddenly appears to wisk Sansa away as if it was a moment he knew was coming.
Â 
The casual watcher (non-reader) likely won't catch it, some one who pays close attention should, and most readers should as well. Its too subtle to be a red herring, yet the connections are there. I think it is what it is.
891	King Walder	2014-04-14	Mixed feelings on the episode tbf. No doubt it was a great episode, my problems are more on book deviations.
Â 
First though on what I liked:
1) Oberyns scene with Tywin and Cersei, you could feel the tension even before he brought up the rape and murder, and his emphasis on Cersei no longer being Queen Regent was great. I hope we get to see much more of him in the next few episodes while we still can.
2) The first signs showing of crazy Cersei - really setting her up for what she will become.
3) The Ramsay/Roose/Reek scene was well done, it was sad watching Theon's reaction to the news of Robb, and Ramsay and Locke seem like new best friends.
4) The death scene was well done, albeit Cersei's reaction was underwhelming.
Â 
What I wasn't fond of:
1) The Stannis scene. Rather than be burning people who committed treason, all they've done is refuse to give up their gods, which is exactly what Davos is also doing, with no punishment.I do however like the care he appears to have for Shireen.
2) This was the perfect chance to reveal Joffrey sent the assassin. Looks like they're just going to leave that plot thread hanging.
Â 
There was another negative but its slipped my mind.
Also, Bran's vision, Snow on the throne anyone? Although it probably is less symbolic and more real
892	Impfan	2014-04-14	Why on earth would they be singing "The Rains of Castamere" at a wedding? Â 
Â 
Anybody who arranged that must have done it in respect of its playing at The Red Wedding".
Â 
Who would have had clout enough to get it into the Purple Wedding's song list? Â Joff was clearly not happy about it being played.
Â 
Did Tywin do it? Â Is he the co-conspirator with Olenna? Â Makes sense. Â Why does he need Joff? Â He's got Tommen. Â He's aware that Joff is off his nut and will bring big trouble. Â It's really a simple decision. Â He's got a ready-made scapegoat in Tyrion as well. Â Tywin's really pissed at Jaime as well. Â He's got to know that Joff is the product of his son and daughter's incest. Â This is the perfect outcome for him
Â 
I think I'm going to have to look at the QoT/Twin pre-wedding chat a few more times.
893	ovis alba	2014-04-14	Using Sansa to "deliver" the poison instead of just bringin it by yourself, to me makes just sense if Sansa can be used as a safety net (which is why a hairnet is much better than a necklace  ) afterwards to put the blame on.
Maybe it was not even the main plan, but the "in case anyone does notice", she's the one with the poison on her head.
894	Morvius	2014-04-14	There was something I found rather perplexing. Tywin's facial expressions. Was he smirking at some points? I can't recall if the books ever mentioned Tywin's expressions throughout the whole farce of the dwarven jousting (and Joffrey's tantrums) but I imagined that he would have disapproved of it (though not openly).
895	NightStark	2014-04-14	Why on earth would they be singing "The Rains of Castamere" at a wedding?Â 

It's a song which demonstrates the power and glory of the Lannisters..it's a Lannister wedding so of course they'll play it.
896	ovis alba	2014-04-14	Why on earth would they be singing "The Rains of Castamere" at a wedding? Â 
Â 


Because it's THE Lannister song, letting everyone know, how badass they are. I remember from the books its played until no one can hear it anymore. Olenna has a sentence like: I hope they play Rains of Castamere again, I have not heard it in an hour, I almost forgot how it goes.
897	Impfan	2014-04-14	The singing of "The Rains of Castamere" at the wedding is some sort of clue to who dunnit, don't you think? Â It's an understatement to say the song isn't "wedding appropriate".
Â 
What do you think it implies as far as identifying the poisoner?
Â 
It's the kind of touch Olenna would think of. Â It's also Tywin's marker, no?
898	NightStark	2014-04-14	Using Sansa to "deliver" the poison instead of just bringin it by yourself, to me makes just sense if Sansa can be used as a safety net (which is why a hairnet is much better than a necklace  ) afterwards to put the blame on.
Maybe it was not even the main plan, but the "in case anyone does notice", she's the one with the poison on her head.

The Tyrells don't care if she gets caught after he's dead.
They know that Tyrion will probably be accused and everyone will look at Sansa as co-conspirator because of what has just happened to her family, close inspection will then turn up the hairnet/necklace with a missing stone...boom..both implicated in it.

It's a Lannister song being played at a Lannister wedding. It's Tywin's greatest hour afterall.

900	Colonel Green	2014-04-14	He may of intended Jaime to marry Sansa after Tyrion was killed.


No, because if you think Tywin was in on the plan, he would have had to have been in on Littlefinger smuggling Sansa out of King's Landing (or else, known where she was afterward).Â  Moreover, Sansa would have been accused alongside Tyrion had she stayed.
Â 


I always felt that the TyrellsÂ didn't want sansa caught so they could continue the original plan and marry her to Willas.


Sansa would have been executed for treason alongside Tyrion.
901	Janicia	2014-04-14	My bet is that Cerseiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s agents followed Bronn and extracted Shae from the ship or captured Shae when she left the ship.Â  I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t think Varys or Bronn had anything to do with Shaeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s capture.Â 
Â 
Varys stuck his neck out twice to get Shae out of Kings Landing.Â  I think he feels guilty about Ros and wants to save Shae.Â  This is a big departure from book Varys, but that seems to be what the show is saying .Â  Varys probably also has been trying to prevent a Lannister meltdown for his murky political purposes.Â  Anyway, if Varys was going to hand Shae over to Tywin, he wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have given Tyrion the warning that morning.
Â 
Bronn is capable of betraying Tyrion, but I think he would have taken his betrayal payout and left town rather than returning to the wedding.Â  He didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know that Tyrion would end up a prisoner that night.Â  He had to assume that Tyrion would find out very soon about the betrayal â<U+0080><U+0093> when Tywin hanged Shae â<U+0080><U+0093> and that an enraged Tyrion would be a nasty enemy.Â

Â 
I don't think Olenna did it... You can see that the wine glass was still on Maergery and Joffrey's table. Even if it was close to Olenna, there was a night standing right behind where the glass was and Olenna would have been detected tampering with Joffrey's wine glass by the Knight. It is fairly obvious to me that Olenna gave the stone to Maergery and Maergery plopped the poison stone in the wine glass when Joffery handed his wine glass to Maergery before he cut the piegon pie, and then she set it on the table.

906	HrafntA1r	2014-04-14	Personally, I really like that there's a very similar level of ambiguity about the poisoner in the TV scene as in the books.Â  It looks like we're getting the "reveal" of the QoT involvement as early as next week (so sooner than we do in the books), at which point the avid fans can go back to the episode and caps that reveal that Olenna touched the necklace, a gem is missing, etc., in just the same way that book fans can go back to the PW chapters to find "confirmation" of LF's explanation.
Â 
But like the books, I'm not sure that what we're going to see/hear is in fact the true/full account of how things went down.Â  For example, maybe we'll see Olenna taking responsibility for the poisoning in her conversation with Margaery, but no mention of Sansa.Â  And then only later when LF talks to Sansa do we get the account that includes her necklace, which would emphasize the LF mind-fuck aspects of the necklace plan.
907	Needle's Pointy End	2014-04-14	I didn't see it either, but I thought it happened when Joffrey was cutting the pigeon pie. Everyone's attention was on that.Â

910	Bannerman918	2014-04-14	I understand why they changed most of the things, including Sir Illyn, but two things I don't get:
Â 
1) Why Melisandre was burning Ser Axell Florent, instead of Ser Alester, and why he suddenly became Selyse's brother. Also, Stannis didn't command his death because he was a sinner (which would make him more of a fanatic), but because he tries to negotiate a peace treaty with Tywin Lannister behind Stannis' back.
Â 
2) Why Lady Olenna doesn't put her hands on Sansa's necklace, to remove one of the gems, possibly containing the poison that killed Joffrey.


Â 
Â 
If you watch her right hand when she's messing with Sansa's hair, you can actually see her take one. Â You have to be looking for it though.

912	Impfan	2014-04-14	I'm sorry, but the "Rains of Castemere" was not being played at the Purple Wedding because it's a "Lannister song". Â Given Tywin's character, he probably dislikes the song. Â  Joff also dislikes the song being played. Â No, this was put in as an avatar of the forthcoming poisoning. Â It's also some sort of a clue to who did the dirty deed on old Joff. Â It's the kind of touch somebody like Olenna would think of. Â 
Â 
I'm still not buying the "she got the poison from Sansa's necklace/hairnet" BS. Â Didn't happen.
913	boojam	2014-04-14	No, because if you think Tywin was in on the plan, he would have had to have been in on Littlefinger smuggling Sansa out of King's Landing (or else, known where she was afterward).Â  Moreover, Sansa would have been accused alongside Tyrion had she stayed.I have never figured out the Tywin conspiracy end of things, from the book he just didn't seem involved, on the other hand he seemed somewhat indifferent to Joffrey death. I can't remember Tywin's expression from last episode, but don't remember much reaction.Tywin has shown more physical expression with his disgust for Tyrion than anybody else.He really would like to him whacked!Oddly, if Oberyn Martell were Machiavellian enough , and it would take some thinking thru, he could have been a co-conspirator too.He could have guessed the consequences of the act and Tryion's trial and hence his revenge... it's a nice package, but I don't thing there's enough evidence in the books.

916	Needle's Pointy End	2014-04-14	Please, let's stop all the nonsensical fantasies about Olenna somehow getting the poison from Sansa's necklace. Â The close up only shows her hand on a stone; it does not show the stone removed from Sansa's necklace. Â It never was. Â Removal would have required much more force than could have been done in a subtle way. Â I think the whole Sansa necklace gambit is a teaser put in by either or both of GRRM and D&D. Â 
Â 
I watched the Sansa/OofT interaction at eh wedding many times. Â I didnt see Olenna remove one of the jewels from Sansa's necklace. Â Maybe she did but you really can't tell.


Â 
How can you honestly say that? Why would Olenna even touch her necklace if that wasn't the case and why was a stone missing from a clasp as soon as Olenna went to go sit down. I think it is pretty obvious that Olenna knew all she had to do was turn a stone to the left or right and it would easily come off the clasp... it was all planned and the kings fool was part of the plan.Â
917	Mihai Brasoveanu	2014-04-14	I thought that the Olenna scenes were BRILLIANT. The dialogue "What kind of monster would kill someone at their one wedding?". The way she touches Sansa's necklace and how she is obviously in the shot next to the glass of wine. All of it seems like a big thumbs-up to the book readers. If you go throught it frame by frame, it's perfectly done.
Â 
She is also the first one to scream "help your king", not even Cersei reacted by then. She was the only one NOT in shock.
Â 
I'm really looking forward to see how LF will make the reveal to Sansa.

She touches both the hairnet in the books and the necklace in the show...both end up with a stone missing after.
Shortly after this, the king is killed by the Strangler...which is a crystal. 
Crystals not unlike the ones missing from the respective accessories.
Honestly, it's just joining the dots...I'd be worried about someone if that didn't click with them in about 2 seconds.

Sansa would have been executed for treason alongside Tyrion.


Thats a huge conclusion to jump to. I know from the books that people suspected it might of been Sansa but that was mainly because she disappeared after it. The fact there was a plot to rescue Sansa might of been purely Coincidental .It was an obvious distraction and the perfect
point in time for Sansa even without Joffrey's death

Dontos told Sansa that her hairnet was magical, and LF told her, it was one of the amethysts. When she examined it, she noticed that one of the purple amethysts was missing.

I still think Olenna had Maergery do it... She was the last to touch Joffery's wine glass (other than Tyrion) where it wouldnt have been obvious. There was a Knight standing right behind that wine glass and that Knight would have likely seen Olenna reach over and put something in Joffery's wine glass.Â

IMO, LF and the QoT are solely to blame, with the help of Sir Dontos the Fool and Sansa as an unknowing contributor. LF destabilizes the realm again, his constant goal, and now he gets Sansa too.

but what do you expect brienne to do? kidnap her out of the city? even talking to her could put either one of them in jeopardy. having brienne see sansa in kl doesn't mean much to be honest. she's hardly ruined since she's clearly off in a minute to find sansa and get her to safety. ironically, brienne mentions bringing sansa to the vale and that's exactly where she'll be. very grrm.
Â 


I wouldn't be surprised if Penny was cut altogether.


Â 
that would only mean someone else becomes tyrion's conscience. her role needs to happen to tyrion although since he isn't as grey on the show, it probably means less time required to find himself.Â

I've always thought that Tywin must have secretly been quite relieved that Joffrey was dead. Â Joffrey grown into adulthood with total power was a scary prospect; Joffrey would have had no qualms about killing Lannisters, including Tywin himself.


Does Tywin's underwhelming/non-reaction to Joffery's death, and the chumminess between Olenna and Tywin give any credence to the Tywin knew about the purple wedding theory?
939	NightStark	2014-04-14	Does Tywin's underwhelming/non-reaction to Joffery's death, and the chumminess between Olenna and Tywin give any credence to the Tywin knew about the purple wedding theory?

Doesn't mean he was in on it but he's probably not sorry it happened.
940	HrafntA1r	2014-04-14	Well, the logistics are easier in the show PW, since Marge isn't sharing that huge-ass goblet of wine with Joffrey.Â  It is surmised from the books that she had to have been in the know, else there'd be the risk that she'd be poisoned, too.Â  But they weren't sharing on the show, which means that they can preserve Marge's "innocence" of the plot.
941	Conchobar	2014-04-14	Does Tywin's underwhelming/non-reaction to Joffery's death, and the chumminess between Olenna and Tywin give any credence to the Tywin knew about the purple wedding theory?


Yes
942	Greywolf2375	2014-04-14	I actually thought the show made it "obvious" that Olenna did it. Â But then again, that's to a Â person who has known that fact for 14 years.... so ...Â 


Â See, that's what bothers me.Â  While I couldn't see the gem missing, it was obvious what she was doing.Â  To the point that none of Tyrions interactions with the cup are done in a way where he could have poisoned it.Â  I mean, the first pour is in front of Tywin & Cersei, the 2nd in front of everyone.Â  There's no ambiguity with the way it was done.
943	SerJeremiahLouistark	2014-04-14	It didn't take that long. The QoT slipped the poison in as Joffrey was cutting the pie. He took a drink and then cut pie. Olenna was right behind him on the dais. and notice she was first one and the second and third one to yell at people to help the king.

Â 
Margaery "Why did you make me poison Joffery with that stone"
Olenna " Your prospects are much improved with Joffery dead. Â He would have killed you for fun at some point in the near future Â "Â 
Margaery " But I would have been Queen"
Olenna " You will still be Queen. You will marry Joffery's little brother. Who isn't a mad man from incest "Â

946	A Man Has Said	2014-04-14	The stannis scene ruined the whole episode for me.
I cant possibly think of a more effective way to demonize a character.


LOLOLOLOL! You DO realize that GRRM wrote this episode, don't you?
It's HIS character, and if you and he differ on the nature of that character, who do you think is more likely to be right?
Â 
Anyway, I think the scene demonizes Melisandre and Selyse far more than it does Stannis.
He mostly just lurks in the background grinding his teeth.Â 
You could easily interpret his actions to mean that he disapproves of the burnings.
It cuts to the dinner table scene, where he feels that the meat is off, but Mel and Selyse are chowing down happily.
I would interpret that to mean that the human sacrifices turned his stomach.
Take some solace in that. He's at least not so utterly depraved as are his wife and concubine.
947	Natalie Underfoot	2014-04-14	Â See, that's what bothers me.Â  While I couldn't see the gem missing, it was obvious what she was doing.Â  To the point that none of Tyrions interactions with the cup are done in a way where he could have poisoned it.Â  I mean, the first pour is in front of Tywin & Cersei, the 2nd in front of everyone.Â  There's no ambiguity with the way it was done.


Â 
I feel like since in the book we didn't know who did it but we knew for a fact Tyrian didn't we are going to get a bit of the reverse. We will know the Tyrell's were involved so that the viewers still get to experience Tyrion being falsely accused. Â I really feel like the biggest twist is LF involvement anyway.
Â 
As far as why Sansa, I just always assumed it was a way to assure that she was completely broken away from Lannister hands. She represents the North to all the main family players. Â The Tyrell's will never get her in their family but if they can get her away from King's Landing in a way that will prevent any sort of reconciliation that's good enough. Â Plus, by Â making Sansa an accessory she's automatically involved and it forces her hand in to joining the cause against the Lannister's. Â I don't know that they expected Tyrion to be accused, my guess was that it was supposed to look like Sansa did it all along and the best way to make her as willing a participant after the fact as possible was to actually have her have a hand in it. Â 
Â 
Plus, spies everywhere, I'm sure Varys had people watching all the Tyrel's plus any of Cersei's henchmen.Â
948	Tori Targaryen	2014-04-14	It's only obvious it was Olenna if you're looking for it. Most of the Unsullied comments I've seen are thinking Tywin, Oberyn, Varys, some actually thinking it WAS Tyrion (pfft) and even Cersei! That last one is just bonkers...
949	jons nissa	2014-04-14	In Bran's vision, it seemed like Ned noticed something and looked up at the tree. Â Implication that Bran can travel to the past through the weirnet.

Â 
not implied. a fact. bran was able to travel through time in the weirnet and we saw dunk the tall and young ned and others through his visions.
Â 
Â 

I kind of like how they made it seem as if Shae escaped. It will be that much more of a shock to the non-readers when she shows up to testify against Tyrion

Â 
i agree. i doubt we'll see shae until she has to testify. the unsullied will lose it!
Â 
Â 

I always read the book passages that their goal was that it appear natural, not that it be a poisoning or that Sansa be blamed, or even Tyrion. Â Of course they would arrange it so that they were not directly involved in any of the chain of events...but I don't know that this means they ever intended for Tyrion and Sansa to be accused.

Â 
Â 
it would seem you're correct about it appearing natural according to grrm himself:
Â http://insidetv.ew.c...joffrey-killed/
Â 

Â I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know how it comes across in the show, because I havenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t actually seen it yet, but the poison that is used to kill Joffrey is one that I introduce earlier in the books and its symptoms are similar to choking. So a feast is the perfect time to use this thing. I think the intent of the murderer is not to have this become another Red Weddingâ<U+0080><U+0094>the Red Wedding was very clearly murder and butchery. I think the idea with Joffreyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s death was to make it look like an accident â<U+0080><U+0094> someoneâ<U+0080><U+0099>s out celebrating, they havenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t invented the Heimlich maneuver, so when someone gets food caught in his throat, itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s very serious.Â 

tyrion and sansa weren't meant to be framed by olenna but tyrion may have been meant to be framed by littlefinger since we know he was behind the entertainment that was bound to get a visible rile out of tyrion right before the king's "death".

951	Maester Totoro	2014-04-14	I'm a big fan of what the creators have done with the show, but I think they kinda screwed up by not mentioning Oberyn's pseudonym so far. Most of my Unsullied friends think of Oberyn as a brute stabby-maniac now, and none even considered it as a posibility for Joff's killer.
Â 
Mace's portrayal was also lacking, I thought. Even Dontos had more composure than him.
Â 
Great episode, though. Loved the Ned visions.
952	fangirl000	2014-04-14	That was gruesome. Like his death in the books, I'm not sure I can applaud it.
Â 
The looks on several characters faces before the death were important. Tywin's, Olenna's, Margaery's, Oberyn's..... I can see that the creators are trying to keep the Unsullied guessing as to who poisoned the King.


Â 
My husband is unsullied, but the placement of the cup in front of the QoT for so long tipped him off. "Well, clearly she had SOMETHING to do with it."
Â 
Edit to add:


The character assassination of Stannis is mind-blowing. Kin-slaying over a religion he is not totally devout to? Really stupid move by D&D. They should have kept the fact that Lord Florent tried to betray Stannis to the Lannisters and thus it was a justifiable execution.

Â 

Â 
The screenplay for this episode was written by GRRM. Â He made the character choices this go round.Â 
Â 
Â 


Â 
I thought it was extremely stupid, and [Shae] isn't that dumb in the show. Â My sister and father will kill you, so you have to get on the boat, end of discussion is much more sensible than what they did.

Â 

Â 
Except, as Tyrion explained to Varys, he told Shae she was in danger so many times without consequence that she just didn't believe it anymore - like he was crying wolf. Â And during their fight, Shae accuses Tyrion of letting his sister and his father drive his actions needlessly. Â Shae wasn't going to leave until Tyrion gave her a reason to reject HIM and not the King's Landing situation.

953	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-04-14	It's only obvious it was Olenna if you're looking for it. Most of the Unsullied comments I've seen are thinking Tywin, Oberyn, Varys, some actually thinking it WAS Tyrion (pfft) and even Cersei! That last one is just bonkers...


Â 
Not entirely, and not when you consider the TV as a different medium. Â Joffrey grew out of hand, she still has Tommen, we've already seen 1 compassionate killing, if the poison had been in the pie then Cersei's redirecting the leftovers was highly coincidental, she almost immediately capitalized and redirected a tragedy into an opportunity to attack Tyrion.
Â 
It seems ridiculous for Cersei in the book, but not show!Cersei, IMO. Â Her horrible acting (whether it was the performance or the editing) at the end of the episode doesn't help matters either. Â I know she didn't do it, and I'm still wondering if she did it...
954	nara	2014-04-14	Why on earth would they be singing "The Rains of Castamere" at a wedding?Â Â 


Â 
Â 


Because it's THE Lannister song, letting everyone know, how badass they are. I remember from the books its played until no one can hear it anymore. Olenna has a sentence like: I hope they play Rains of Castamere again, I have not heard it in an hour, I almost forgot how it goes. 


Â 
Â 


I'm sorry, but the "Rains of Castemere" was not being played at the Purple Wedding because it's a "Lannister song". Â Given Tywin's character, he probably dislikes the song. Â  Joff also dislikes the song being played. Â No, this was put in as an avatar of the forthcoming poisoning. Â It's also some sort of a clue to who did the dirty deed on old Joff. Â It's the kind of touch somebody like Olenna would think of.Â Â 


Â 
Although it's not clear from the books whether or not Tywin (or his children) actually likes the song, it's definitely played by musicians who are trying to kiss Lannister butt.Â  However, I was under the impression that there were several interpretations of this song, some somber, some cheerful--though I can't find textual evidence at the moment.Â  I assumed it was a cheerful version that was played at the wedding.Â  The Lannisters definitely use it to their advantage when they see fit, but I doubt they want to hear it as frequently as it's played at the wedding.

Â 
My issue is, considering GRRM wrote the majority of this episode, it just didn't have that usual buzz of 'what stuff will he throw in for the readers!?' vibe. Bran's greendreams are grand and all, but that plotline has potential t seriously stagnate. Only glimmer of hope is that my boyfriend is fairly convinced he spotted Cold Hands' horse in the green dream near the tree, so that might perk my interest up again.
Â 
Overall, though, I feel the pace has actually lulled a bit too much. Dany is as uninteresting as ever, King's Landing is going to do the same pretty soon unless they do a lot with the trial and ensuing combat between oberyn and the mountain, Arya and the Hound seem to just be meandering until she heads to Braavos.Â 
Â 
I can't quite put my finger on it but the Buzz i've had about the show before isn't really there, they've made slight changes to characters (Cersei, Stannis, Tyrion spring to mind) just enough to irk me, because there appears to be no justification for it. I worry that working with the show is changing GRRM's opinion of how he did it X number of years ago and that he's going to sway too far from whats been written already.Â

Of course I won't believe TV Shae will come back unless I see it with my own eyes. 
GRRM is tricky and his characters aren't always omniscient or truthful but he is.  
I don't agree - the Rains of Castamere was IMHO written expressly to record the fate of House Reyne, eliminated in the signature Tywin way, not nec a Lannister signature, a TYWIN Lannister signature. Recall how Maelys told Connington how Tywin would have handled Stony Sept. Tywin likes others to hear that song very much. If there were a Tarbeck song, he'd want peopl to hear that too. Where else to remind big shots of the realm than in his house with as many big shots present as guests as his son the king gets married? 
Joffrey was just bored and spoiled.

Â 
NB - GRRM talks in terms of the books - referring to Joffrey as "a thirteen year old".


Â 
Interesting comments, but they relate far more to the book than to the actual episode. Â TV-Joffrey definitely looks older than 13, he looks at least 16; I didn't see a 'young boy' dying in his mother's arms, I saw a teenager or young man. Â And I didn't see enough horror/terror in Cersei while Joffrey died, it's as if she shut down until after he died and then started to go ballistic. Â (one moment that really impressed me in the book, after Joffrey died, if I remember right, it was Tywin who pulled Cersei away from his body; it was the one time he acted like her father rather than the grand Lannister chessmaster) Â 
Â 
What brought home the horror of the death of this young king in the TV episode was not his mother's reaction, but Jaime's. Â Jaime ran toward the boy, calling him by name rather than a royal title, trying to help in some way as Joffrey was choking his life away. Â Whether Jaime reacted as a father (unlikely, since he'd never felt like a father to Joffrey) or an uncle (which he was) or Kingsguard (unlikely, or he would have called the boy "Sire" or "Your Grace") or as the one who had loved Joffrey's mother in every way since they were young children, in that moment, he was terribly afraid for Joffrey and came to his aid. Â

I would rather D+D use their own skills in making TV rather than copying every tiny little detail from the books, which presumably weren't written with a TV audience in mind.Exactly, the clawing at his throat helps you to visualise the book death, I don't think the show death needed anymore help. The makeup detail alone made it horrid.
I think some readers go overboard demanding details, it's often pretty apparent what is going on. You could see the anguish on Cat's face last year..we didn't need the face clawing for example.

Leaf, who is 200 years old, describes CH as having been killed "long ago".
Two years (?) is not a long time for a creature that's lived for two centuries.

990	Goody2shoes15	2014-04-14	Exactly, the clawing at his throat helps you to visualise the book death, I don't think the show death needed anymore help. The makeup detail alone made it horrid.
I think some readers go overboard demanding details, it's often pretty apparent what is going on. You could see the anguish on Cat's face last year..we didn't need the face clawing for example.


Â 
Â 


Â 
I don't see how it's important whether they have Joffrey clawing at his throat or not. It doesn't alter the story in any way so why does it matter? I would rather D+D use their own skills in making TV rather than copying every tiny little detail from the books, which presumably weren't written with a TV audience in mind.


Â 
Ok maybe not the clawing exactly, but there's been other moments. A better example from that exact scene is how I didn't think they handled Cersei's reaction very well. They spent a lot of time showing her inner conflict about Joffrey, the struggle of watching the monster he became vs the baby she loved so much, and i think it worked very well. She should have been more distraught than she was. For her to turn around almost instantly and go for Tyrion wasn't necessary, she didn't need to notice he was pointing at him, everyone who could see him would have noticed that, she should have been too beside herself with grief. It's is a massive turning point for her character and I think they didn't quite handle it as they should have. GRRM has been quoted as saying in several interviews he wanted viewers to realise that a child has been killed and that at that moment she is a mother grieving, but I don't think they pulled it off.
991	Aderyn	2014-04-14	Shit, I've been following the discussion here for too long and now this thread has almost doubled it's length...
Â 
Well, what can I say. I have this very empty feeling like I always do when seeing a major scene from the books played on screen. I liked the episode, it felt a bit tight-packed at first but when the focus shifted entirely to the wedding it became more balanced.
Â 
The opening was interesting. It was indeed clever of D&D to start with the Bastard of Bolton, just to remind us that here's another character to be hated. I liked the Roose-Ramsay-Theon interaction very much. It was also lovely to see Bran again, although that weirwood tree vision felt... I don't know, not subtle enough or something. But interesting, I'll have to return to that scene episode for a more meticulous watch. The Stannis part had some very interesting scenes, like the awkward dinner talk and Melisandre and Shireen's conversation. This really increased my curiousness about Shireen, what a smart little girl, and how calm she seemed in Mel's presence... Also yay, a short glimpse of Davos! been missing yah!
Â 
I didn't think there was anything weird or disturbing about Tyrion and Shae's scene. It all seemed very clear to me. Varys had been warning Tyrion for some time, he'd been thinking about getting rid of her for a long time... And when Tyrion finally told her to leave it rang so much of Tysha. He forced himself to finally admit what a fool he was for (seemingly) falling in love with a whore - again. And when Bronn told he'd take her to the ship... well, that's when it got suspicious. She's told to leave and then it's just that, she disappears. I don't think she's actually left King's Landing at all. I'm pretty sure Bronn is no longer loyal to Tyrion (if he, a sellsword every truly was), he took Shae somewhere else (to Varys, perhaps?) and she'll be found in Tywin's chambers later in this season. That seems like a scene they wouldn't leave out. At least I really, really hope so.......
Â 
Oh, the wedding... It was rather nicely done. So much delicious character interaction not seen in the books... I'm going to have to hand a trophy to Loras as well, that was one sweet burn... I was trying to keep track of every major character in the wedding ceremony, every sneaky hint about the poisoning etc. so it was a lot of fun to watch. Then finally, Joff's death -- that was very much like I had imagined! I absolutely love Jack Gleeson, this was the perfect way to end his swan song. It was tragic and really showed Joffrey as the young boy he really is. Cersei's reaction bothered me however, but since that was when all her suspicions about Tyrion reached a peak, her flashing rage was understandable. We'll see more of a mother lamenting her son in the next episode...
992	Cas Stark	2014-04-14	I just don't think that Lena was up to the acting task of the level of Book Cersei's complete emotional meltdown, I can't see why else they wouldn't have done it, as it was, a true turning point for her, where she sheds one more level of her relationship to objective reality in favor of her own version of truth.
993	Lady cut throat	2014-04-14	The beginning of the episode with Ramsay chasing that girl through the woods was so damn good in such a sadistic way. I thought it was more sinister because he had his girlfriend(?) partaking too and I think that kind of thing is always a bit more shocking when a woman is involved. Being the gentler sex and all.
The episode on a whole was generally uncomfortable viewing which was perfect! especially poor Tyrion at the wedding, you can just feel that humiliation through the TV screen.
I thought the show made the whole Tyrion/Shae break up better than the book and shows the way for Shae's betrayal of Tyrion and why (I don't think the book gave a good explanation for this really). I have to agree though, Lena didn't do Cersei any justice but then maybe it's because we are comparing the scene to the Catelyn/Robb one.

994	ovis alba	2014-04-14	I just watched the Olenna/Sansa scene again and she is clearly first going once over her hair and the second time taking a stone from the necklace, while saying "killing a man at a wedding, ... what a monster would do that", in the next shot on Sansa there is a empty "hook" on the necklace where a stone should have been, to me that part is perfectly clear.
What happens afterwards is more of a guess. Olenna could give the stone to Margaery right afterwards when she passes by her to get to her seat. To me in the show that seems likely because before Joffrey drinks out of the cup Olenna is not really close enough to the cup to put it in herself, basically Margaery is the only one that is.
(It's actually fun sorting it out  )
995	KhalDrewby	2014-04-14	I'm back to thinking they're going to have Tywin kill Shae and it will be a total total whitewash of the whole thing.


This wouldn't surprise me. I remember reading somewhere that a few changes will be made in the season to keep the book readers on their toes as well as the unsullied. Maybe this will be used as another reason for Tyrion to kinslay?Â

I think you're doing Lena a disservice. She was practically frothing at the mouth at the end of the last episode. I think we'll have to wait and see, but I have faith in her.

Â 
I think the crticism could maybe be levelled more at the director/scriptwriter (sorry GRRM!) Lena usually delivers Cersei's stuff exceptionally well, and I do think she's capable of going over that precipice that is the edge of sanity, but she needs the right words and direction to do it.
1001	The Taxman	2014-04-14	I just watched the Olenna/Sansa scene again and she is clearly first going once over her hair and the second time taking a stone from the necklace, while saying "killing a man at a wedding, ... what a monster would do that", in the next shot on Sansa there is a empty "hook" on the necklace where a stone should have been, to me that part is perfectly clear.

Â 
After Olenna takes the stone, as she is walking pass Joffrey's cup you head a distinct "Cling" sound as if something solid touched a chalice if your volume is high enough. Olenna took the stone and slipped it in the cup. I just don't know how the stone dissolved in the cup. Marg didn't do anything but she definitely knew the plan.
1002	Waylin Stark	2014-04-14	I really liked the makeup department's work.
I expected Joffrey to simply go purple and keep clawing at his face, but the blood from the nose, the red lips, and the bloody eyes were all a magnificent touch. Made it clear he was poisoned and didn't choke, which somehow seems more deadly.

I get that screentime and Â casting budget limitations are the reason, but the creepy/funny factor with each of the fools, is just the thing that gives the ASOIaF world it's depth and flavor. Â 
Â 
Little touches like Lady Olenna having her bodyguards (Left and Right) is another examples.

I know that adding ancillary characters to the biggest cast in TV history makes no sense, but everyone has their favorites, and I am just a fan of fools, I guess.

I hear the sound, I just doubt it's the stone. Before Joffrey drinks from it he pours the whole content over Tyrion, so I asume the poison had to get in there afterwards.
1005	ovis alba	2014-04-14	Something different: I read by quiet a few people that Joffreys death was not "cruel" enough for them, I however always found it extremly well fitting.
Â 
In the end, he really is just a pretty young boy that treats people however he wants to, because he feels untouchable. He is protected by his guards, by his mother, his uncle, his grandfather and just plainly by the fact he is king and everyone has to love him. That's why he dares to be the way he is, because of all the people surrounding and protecting him. For him then to die with all these people standing right there, watching him, but not being able to do anything because he might have all the power in the world but he and none of his tons of people are able to fight the very blunt and almost boring, unglamorous fact that a piece of cake (or actually a sip of wine) is making him choke, I just love it. There is probably hardly any death less heroic than this one and I think this is what would bother Joffrey a lot.

He would have died much sooner if that was the case as he was drinking wine watching the dwarfs ect...

I watched it over, and it looked like Olenna hadn't moved. It would have been terribly suspicious of her to do so.
Â 
However, notice that Joff hands Margaery his cup, and she puts it down without taking a sip. I'm thinking that it could have been her that slipped it in.

A possible problem with my theory is Margaery's discussion with her mother in the next episode, shown in the preview. She doesn't seem to happy with it.
1010	ovis alba	2014-04-14	If there is anything about Margaery it's that she is doing her duty. I think she might have not been happy with the plan, but if Olenna told her to do it, she would have done, whatever is asked of her, no matter how she feels about it.
1011	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-04-14	Â 
See this is my main issue from a book-reader's point of view. Just a little bit more attention to detail on their part would give us a bit more of a satisfaction buzz in noticing little details like that without necessarily altering a scene at all. It almost feels lazy at times.
Â 
Â 
It was always going to be hard to fill half an episode while working around the PW. They managed it better for the RW because scenes like the hound and arya were still tying into it. Â Imo there was actually too much of the wedding, it went beyond anticipation and went to the point of 'Oh my god, just show it already'


Â 
The interrelation of the various storylines (or lack thereof)Â is definitely a part of the challenge. Â I think the bigger problem, however, is that the inherent lack of storyline-resolution promotes a general lack of scene-resolution (or put another way, lazy writing). Â As a viewer I don't expect things to be tied up in a neat little bow, particularly in this genre, but I do expect some sort of fulfillment.
Â 
Case in point: Ep 1 opened with the reforging of Ice, roll VTR, then Tywin gives Jaime his sword and disowns him (sort of). Â I still have no idea what happened to the 2nd sword, I don't know if Jaime was actually disowned, and I don't really know why he's smiling about it, but I don't feel jerked around when they smash cut to KL because the scene was resolved (same thing when they cut away from Oberyn after his line about repaying debts).
Â 
I'm not a good judge of whether they resolved the opening scene last night because I've pretty much lost all interest in Ramsay Snow (I get it, he's a sadist, Theon is ruined). Â The breakfast with Jaime and Tyrion set up Bronn nicely, but when we cut away from them on the waterfront I did feel jerked around because I was still expecting to get something out of it other than some pointless dialogue and sparring. Â It was a stark contrast (Get it? Â Stark?) from the scene in Season 1 with Syrio and Arya.
Â 
Other than Tyrion sending Harry back into the woods to avoid the hunters - I mean Shae to Pentos to avoid his father - there wasn't much in the way of scene transition or resolution in Ep 2. Â I think that's what makes it feel like nothing is happening, even when sometimes something really big is happening.

I never understood this theory.
Leaf, who is 200 years old, describes CH as having been killed "long ago".
Two years (?) is not a long time for a creature that's lived for two centuries.

Also, Bran never recognizes CH as his uncle, despite hearing his voice and seeing the top of his face.

1020	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-14	I loved everyone's reactions to the mockery of the kings during the dwarves performance. Olenna wasn't amused, Loras storming away, Margaery being very displeased and Oberyn sitting stony faced in the clapping crowd obviously thinking 'how effing disrespectful...so not funny.' It's good to know some who didn't have a direct relationship with the Kings still have some respect for them....unlike Cersei who enjoyed Renly riding Loras way too much and Tywin smiling at joffreys amusement. Although, Sansa really stole that scene with her cold, yet crying inside gaze. Excellent scene and very well acted!
1021	The Taxman	2014-04-14	Â

Â 
The big misinterpretation from both unsullied and bookreaders are that they believed this poison is a rapid acting poison and that the poison was in the wine itself.
Â 
The poison is immersed into the golden chalice itself. Joffrey was already poisoned during the Dwarf jousting spectacle. After he sips his drink during the spectacle, you could already see how disoriented he was when he got up off his seat to congratulate the performers (people probably thought he was drunk, but no he was not, he was really disoriented).Â
1022	ovis alba	2014-04-14	That would be too much of of a coincidence for me as he starts choking exactly when he started drinking again. Slow poison ok, but it sets in the exact moment he starts drinking from the cup again is unlikely. And if it's in the cup to start with the stone from Sansas necklace wouldn't be needed. So, nah not really buying it.
1023	ilhanicus	2014-04-14	I clearly didn't read the book closely enough the first time, I don't remember Olenna having anything to do with Joffrey getting poisoned. I DO remember Littlefinger explaining to Sansa that a couple of the Kingsguard were in his pocket and that he got one of them to poison the King, but I'm clearly misremembering because in 50 pages no one has mentioned this. Might have to give it another read through.
1024	Opisthokont!	2014-04-14	They botched the editing of the jewel-nabbing scene quite a bit. Olenna adjusts Sansa's braids, plucks the jewel with her right hand, directly moves it to her left hand - then it cuts to a camera angle from behind her, showing her left hand resting on the table, clearly not holding anything. A couple of seconds later, after Tyrion arrives, she again moves something from her right hand to her left hand, and then it looks like she is pinching something between her left thumb and long finger (her index finger is poking out, the rest of the fingers tense). And then there are a couple of weird cuts where the camera is from her side, with her right hand on Sansa's shoulder, and from her front, with both her hands down by her waist. It cuts back and forth a couple of times, instantaneously.
Â 
Â 
They obviously did at least two takes and edited them together, missing that they were slightly different. That could definitely confuse people.

I have to say, while I can't really blame the show for this given the paucity of the source material, I find it very hard to summon up any interest in Bran's story at this point. I hope the new elements will make it more interesting in the coming episodes.Â  And they really need to make the representation of Bran's abilities more interesting.

Â 
Yeah, you're misremembering. Quick refresher: Dontos asks Sansa to wear the hairnet with the "purple amethysts from Asshai" on it. She does so. During the wedding Olenna comes over and fiddles with Sansa's hairnet. Joff dies.Â  As Sansa is escaping she notices that one of her "amethysts" has gone missing and left a powdery residue behind in the setting for the jewel. The implication in the book is clear; the "amethysts" were actually crystallized poison (the Strangler) and Sansa was used to smuggle the poison into the wedding. Littlefinger is the one who arranged for Sansa to be Olenna's "poison mule".
Â 
Why exactly LF wanted to use Sansa for this is still unclear to me, but I would guess that he was the one providing the poison and he suggested this means of delivery to Olenna because it would force Sansa to leave the city and go with Littlefinger once the deed was done -- obviously if Sansa were discovered to be the one who smuggled in the poison that killed Joff, she would be executed summarily as the Lannisters would never believe she had no knowledge of the "amethysts".

What? That's where the poison came from. The poison is ingrained within the chalice itself after Olenna dropped it in . Sublimation friend.Â
1035	Colonel Green	2014-04-14	Yeah, you're misremembering. Quick refresher: Dontos asks Sansa to wear the hairnet with the "purple amethysts from Asshai" on it. She does so. During the wedding Olenna comes over and fiddles with Sansa's hairnet. Joff dies.Â  As Sansa is escaping she notices that one of her "amethysts" has gone missing and left a powdery residue behind in the setting for the jewel. The implication in the book is clear; the "amethysts" were actually crystallized poison (the Strangler) and Sansa was used to smuggle the poison into the wedding. Littlefinger is the one who arranged for Sansa to be Olenna's "poison mule".


Also, subsequently Littlefinger knows that one of the amethysts is missing and that someone touched the hairnet, and knows that it was Olenna who did it.
Â 
As to why it was necessary, I don't think it was at all.Â  It was a literary flourish on Martin's part, more than anything else.
1036	Needle's Pointy End	2014-04-14	Â 
Why would that be unlikely? You ever been slowly poisoned before from a cup of wine before?
Â 
Then don't buy it. But that's how it went down.Â 


Â 
Um no...Â 
Â 
Olenna slipped the stone to her granddaughter who then plopped it in Joffery's wine when he gave her his wine goblet so he could cut the pigeon pie... done and done!Â

Why exactly LF wanted to use Sansa for this is still unclear to me, but I would guess that he was the one providing the poison and he suggested this means of delivery to Olenna because it would force Sansa to leave the city and go with Littlefinger once the deed was done -- obviously if Sansa were discovered to be the one who smuggled in the poison that killed Joff, she would be executed summarily as the Lannisters would never believe she had no knowledge of the "amethysts".

i agree. littlefinger wanted something to force sansa's hand and having her connected to the murder is definitely good for keeping her close to him.Â

Thing is, the hairnet doesn't connect her to the murder anymore than her fleeing the city, because nobody knows about the hairnet, and the Tyrells couldn't bring it up without inviting questions about how they know that.Â  Also, Sansa really did not need more incentive to leave the city than she already had.
Â 
To follow up on my earlier observation about Bran, what his part of the story really needs is some of the visual style of NBC's Hannibal.Â  Not in terms of gore, mind you, but Bran's visions need to be trippy, beautiful and macabre in the same way (and on a TV budget); in the show as it stands they're super-mundane, mostly either him walking and/or seeing images of a bird squawking.

To ME that does not make any sense compared to putting poison in the drink before someone actually drinks it and then chokes to death right after he drank it. Otherwise the timing of the whole thing would be way to random to play out so perfectly when he drinks from the cup, Tyrion hands him. If there is too much conincidence I rather go with what makes way more sense.

Â 
If someone really wanted or needed Sansa to go down for the crime, all it would take is an anonymous tip to Cersei to check Sansa's jewelry, and Sansa would be dead meat.Â  This might have happened if suspicion had fallen on Margaery instead of on Tyrion and the Tyrells needed a scapegoat, or at least that could be how Littlefinger sold the plan to Olenna.Â  But I don't think LF expected that Sansa would actually go down for the crime -- making her an unwilling part of the plot was his way of binding Sansa to him with no other protectors. If she tries to leave him, LF can still drop the penny on her. I bet he could even produce the "jeweler" who "made the hairnet specifically on Lady Sansa's orders" before the wedding.Â  No one would believe Sansa if she tried to explain how things really went down, not that I think Sansa would do that.Â 
Â 
In any case the greatest effect is on Sansa herself: she's terrified to know that she was a pawn in this scheme and that it will come down on her if someone (like Petyr...) needs it to do so. This keeps her under LF's thumb quite nicely.

1043	VladimirDulud	2014-04-14	Suddenly I regret reading the books before watching the show.Â 
Â 
Â 
Sigh. What a let down. I thought this was gonna be the episode of the century. I'm so worried that the show is losing its edge.


Â 
I too regret reading the books. They set quite a few bars that are quite high for a dramatic production to meet.
Â 
There is something about the way the wedding was rushed, to my mind, that was the first red flag.
Â 
There was quite a lot of hoopla surrounding the episode - everything from the lavish production to the cameos etc. - so I was surprised to see that they rushed through certain things.
Â 
I was really expecting a longer ceremony, with perhaps more scenes detailing guest star reactions, for one.
Â 
The work that went into the costumes, esp. Margaery's, would have been fantastic to spotlight - maybe a scene where we see her try it on?
Â 
That may have been a tad fetishistic for lovers of the show, but still - the production is a beautiful one and I feel like I missed quite a lot of the artistry somehow.
Â 
The scene with Ramsay and Reek were strong, but could have been included in a later episode. I would have made use of the show's penchant for sexposition to instead do some 'production-design-exposition' - using props, sigils of the various houses present, - to establish the totality of the world of the past three seasons.
Â 
The manner in which the potential poisoning was produced also seemed strange. I watched the episode with someone who had not read the books and had no idea what was going to happen - there is really no way to tell what exactly happened.
Â 
Which indicates something to do with story design, of course.Â 
Â 
Overall, it felt like a missed opportunity...

Â 
I see where you're coming from. When Joffrey pours the wine over Tyrion's head, Tyrion does taste it and it does not kill him so we can rule out the poison taking effect at any moment prior. But Olenna definitely slipped the crystal into the chalice as she walks by Joffrey's cup because we can hear a distinct chime when we see her arm does the dropping motion.
Â 
If the poison was in its crystallization state, it would readily dissolve in any solvent so how the hell do you explain that? Could Marg have taken the crystal out of the chalice? No. I did not see it and it just isn't plausible.Â 
Â 
My take is GRRM didn't completely understand the science behind the method so there will be several loopholes. Even when LF was explaining to Sansa in the books I was still confused as to how it actually went down.Â

Â 
Who had the Pigeon Pie made? The Tyrell's? Joffery could have been poisoned earlier in the episode with the stone in his wine but eating the pie created a chemical reaction with the poisoned wine he already drank. Â Notice Margaery didn't eat any pie... she just fed it to Joffery.Â
1046	Rill Redthorn	2014-04-14	But Olenna definitely slipped the crystal into the chalice as she walks by Joffrey's cup because we can hear a distinct chime when we see her arm does the dropping motion.

Â 
I went back and viewed that "chime" part several times and I don't actually think it was meant to represent the chime of the poison crystal hitting anything. The view of Olenna was across the courtyard and there were several tables of diners in the way; the "clink" sound that happens as Olenna's arm moves to me sounded like it was meant to be a wineglass knocking against silverware or a plate -- normal dining noise, basically, not an audio clue.Â  No one standing where the camera was when the chime was heard would have been able to hear anything because Olenna was too far away and there was too much else going on.
Â 
I do think that Olenna's arm going back was her dropping the crystal in the pocket of her gown, but that wouldn't make any noise of course. And it might be a coincidence: Diana Rigg might have needed to adjust her costume right at that moment by happenstance.

Â 
When Joffrey cut the pie, Olenna's ass was all the way at another table. Nowhere near the chalice.

1049	ovis alba	2014-04-14	To me it's still way to complicated this way. Yes, I do here something, but s it really the stone? I can not tell. Is it really Joffreys cup? I can not even see it clearly there? Or is it maybe Margaerys cup or plate she drops it in/on to hand it over to her? Or does she just drop it in Margaerys lap and the sound is from the musicians or someone dropping a sword?
To me putting it in Joffereys cup at that very moment seems extremly risky, which seems unlikely when a poison is hidden so well to start with. It visually and timely doesn't make any sense to me either to poison him an hour in advance just for him to spill his wine over Tyrion who tries it and doesn't get sick and then to collapse right at that moment where we actually do see him drink from that cup that went through Margaerys hands just before and was standing there unattended while the pie was brought, with the cup also standing pretty close to Olenna, who we see getting the stone before.
Â 
It just doesn't play out for me.

Â 
Agreed... I do not believe Olenna physically put the dissolving poison stone in Joffery's wine. Olenna had to have given that duty to Margaery. There is a theory that Olenna could have given the stone to a wine server employed by littlefinger to put the stone in the Joffery's wine pitcher on his table, but the wine that Tyrion pored for Joffery was from Tywin and the Mother of Madness's table.Â 
Â 
The only way Margaery didn't actually physically do it was if Olenna passed it off to a littlefinger wine server and the wine actually poisoned both Margaery and Joffery earlier, but the poison wouldn't activate unless the pigeon pie was eaten.... Olenna could have told Margaery " What ever you do, do not eat the Pigeon Pie. Your life depends on it "Â

Why does it have to be Olenna physically? Just because dearest grandma is the brain of the operation, doesn't mean her granddaughter couldn't slip it in.. Olenna protecting Margaery and Margaery making sure she gets the softer king, who is easily manipulated. Both had a reason.

Certainly possible. Â It's highly coincidental that, at the exact moment she passes the offending chalice, she makes that motion and we hear that sound, but it's definitely circumstantial.
Â 
I sincerely hope that "offending chalice" is a term I get to use many more times in my life, though I'm sadly skeptical.
1054	MoA«t	2014-04-14	As much as I hated Joff, I will miss Jack Gleeson. He is done acting now. He is so good I wish he would keep it up, but I totally respect his choice to leave it. He had an awesome death scene.

1055	CommanderBC	2014-04-14	So. It's most likely they have cut Coldhands out of the show.
He could still make an appearance, but since Sam never met him, and Bran havn't met him yet. In e02 says Bran says "I know where we have to go". I would say the chances that they cut him out is pretty good..
Â 
What would it mean? I think the mystery of who he is, and how he can be dead and a goody is one of the book's deepest secrets.
IF they have cut him out, would that be evidence that he is indeed just a dead crow, controlled by tCoTF to help important persons make their goal? I think so, even though I would be happily surprised if he turned out to be either Benjen or The Night King.

1057	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-14	LOLOLOLOL! You DO realize that GRRM wrote this episode, don't you?
It's HIS character, and if you and he differ on the nature of that character, who do you think is more likely to be right?
Â 
Anyway, I think the scene demonizes Melisandre and Selyse far more than it does Stannis.
He mostly just lurks in the background grinding his teeth.Â 
You could easily interpret his actions to mean that he disapproves of the burnings.
It cuts to the dinner table scene, where he feels that the meat is off, but Mel and Selyse are chowing down happily.
I would interpret that to mean that the human sacrifices turned his stomach.
Take some solace in that. He's at least not so utterly depraved as are his wife and concubine.


Â 
I do know they move scenes around sometimes, from one episode to the other, and I wonder how much GRRM did have to do with the writing of the Stannis scenes.Â  I do agree with your interpretation of Stannis's feelings about the burnings as shown by his attitude and yes, his dinner complaints.Â  I do think D&D, in some respects, have tied GRRM's hands with their Stannis writings, so far, anyway.Â  While I do think that Stannis turning up at the Wall will, would, and should be a turning point in the show, I still have to wonder WHY...........whoever did the damn writing, couldn't have also had Florent (Axell, Alester, whoever, LOL) send some type of offer in a letter to Tywin.Â  Irregardless of the fact that Davos is Hand and Florent wasn't at all, they could have added a bit of treasonous intent to go with the burning, it wouldn't have taken that long to explain.Â  It could have been some extra words in the sentences about infidels, the refusing to burn the idols of The Seven, AND.........attempting to send a letter to Tywin, offering peace and offering to try and convince Stannis to marry Shireen off to Tommen.Â  It would have been a few more sentences, I don't see the problem with them doing that little bit.
Â 
Still, I am one who does expect Stannis' character to be back on track by the end of the season.Â  I can understand the frustration some fans may have, but..........I'm hopeful it will start turning around soon.Â  You are right about how obvious it was that Stannis was none too pleased.Â  Now it's time to for the show to make that even more clear.....and for Stannis to start putting his foot down to burnings that are just about religion.Â  I hope so, I do think it's coming, and....I hope the Stanfans hang in there a bit longer.Â  The next couple episodes should tell us.Â

Â 
Those first scenes with Ramsey were so hard to watch. Surprisingly. I expect horror. That turned my stomach - especially Alfie's face.
Â 
I'm not having the problem with Stannis's character like so many here are. He seems very torn by this crazy path he's on. He seems to honestly believe this is his path, as horrible as it is, to save the world from itself, and thinks he really has run out of all other options. It's like a person who's made a bad decision but are in denial even to themselves, and keeps trying to convince everyone (especially themselves), that this is the only path, and if they keep going ALL-IN, it will eventually turn around.
Â 
Loved Bran's vision. (That does look like a blue rose in the ice - thanks for whomever screencapped that.) All the footage while he was Summer I think is a great setup for a very similar thing they could do when (and hopefully if) they finally get to Jon and Arya's warging abilities.... could be very similar footage, but the reveal is not Bran. Could be AWESOME
Â 
Loved the Shae/Tyrion scene. Perfect way to set up what's to come, and creating a huge shock when it does, since the Unsullied will think she's safe.
Â 
Loved everything with the Dornish. Just brilliant.
Â 
Lady Olenna and her fussing with the necklace was shot perfectly, and worked so much better (and easier to shoot) than a hair net would be, especially since no one really ever wears a snood in this world, and the only person to wear serious hair jewelry is Ellaria. Love that they made it so book readers could track it fairly easily.
Â 
I'd be perfectly fine with 86ing Penny.

Love Jack so much.Â

Â 
I wonder how they will get Stannis to the wall. Will we get to follow their journey, or will they appear first when the battle comes..


You can see Stannis's ship sailing under the Titan of Braavo's cause he's gonna visit the Iron Bank.

1078	Mark Antony	2014-04-14	When Joffrey cut the pie, Olenna's ass was all the way at another table. Nowhere near the chalice.
yeah you're correct she was at the next table down, the shot made it seem like the chalice was in front of her. Either way no way she dropped it when she was walking away from Sansa. Far to early

Put in a couple posts and got nothing.
At least I knew what I thought I saw was right though I thought Tywinn was using his arms to totally cover him.
1081	The Taxman	2014-04-14	Yeah but who knows what the heck we are looking at in that screen capture....looks like f*ck all to me. I don't see a blue rose.


Â 
Because there isn't a blue rose. If anything, it's a face. Anyone who says they see a blue rose is just grasping for straws.Â
1082	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-14	I didn't even notice Tywin covering Tommen's eyes. I'm going to ignore that because 'caring grandpa' is just too dam adorable and will conflict my 'Tywin is an evil Bastard who deserves to die on the shitter' feels. Although, to be fair he did have some softer moments with Arya in season 2 as well.      
Catelyn's eyes weren't covered when Robb was killed, Rhaenys may have covered her cats eyes and the Reynes may have tried to cover their kids eyes....Bingo! Still an evil bastard...with some fucked up morals. 
Although, it will be interesting to see if we get any Tywin giving Tommen advice/wisdom scenes.
1083	Zman1863	2014-04-14	So, um, Tywin totally covers Tommen's eyes while his brother convulses. My heart might have cracked a little bit.Â 


Â 
I didn't notice that either. On that note, I like how they handled Tywin's reaction. They show that quick moment where the armor comes off, but then the last shot of him has him back in control. I think if they had featured that shot of him covering Tommen's eyes more prominently I wouldn't be a fan. It seems a bit too much out of character.Â
1084	jons nissa	2014-04-14	Thing is, the hairnet doesn't connect her to the murder anymore than her fleeing the city,


Â 
actually her fleeing the city is her biggest connection to being guilty in the minds of those at court, especially the lannisters.
Â 
Â 



Â Also, Sansa really did not need more incentive to leave the city than she already had.

Â 


Â 


Â 
Â But I don't think LF expected that Sansa would actually go down for the crime -- making her an unwilling part of the plot was his way of binding Sansa to him with no other protectors. If she tries to leave him, LF can still drop the penny on her. I bet he could even produce the "jeweler" who "made the hairnet specifically on Lady Sansa's orders" before the wedding.Â  No one would believe Sansa if she tried to explain how things really went down, not that I think Sansa would do that.Â 
Â 
In any case the greatest effect is on Sansa herself: she's terrified to know that she was a pawn in this scheme and that it will come down on her if someone (like Petyr...) needs it to do so. This keeps her under LF's thumb quite nicely.


Â 
this. it wasn't about convincing sansa to leave king's landing, it was about convincing her not to try to leave him.
1085	MoA«t	2014-04-14	I was really hoping Jaime would not just be an ass to Loras and invite him into the Kingsguard. Â But I think I'm the only person who cares that he isn't in a white cloak.
It looked like that was his next statement to Loras, but Loras took offense and got snippy. Jamie was left standing there with that look of, "Why does everyone get offended when I'm sympathizing and trying to help?" on his face, just like when Ned got to King's Landing in season 1.
1086	kolyu	2014-04-14	Didn't like the way Cersei reacted. You can see there was something missing... realism i guess. She went from pure shock, to overwhelmed by madness. They could have done it better.
Â 
Didn't like when Summer killed the deer, i mean from pure technical point of view, he effects looked unrealistic. I felt like I can do it better if i had a camera. I know this might not be important to you guys... but it just looks unprofessional.

The little things grind my gear
1087	Cyberia	2014-04-14	I'm not sure why people think the Tyrells were scapegoating Sansa, except purely for jaded cynicism.Â  Look, the Tyrells LIKE Sansa, legitimately.Â  Straight up.Â  The QoT and Margery have had several scenes with Sansa and there has been ZERO hint that they are double-crossing her.Â  In fact there is an interview with Natalie Dormer where she explicitly says the Tyrells ARE NOT taking advantage of Sansa.Â  I think people are simply to jaded by Lannister methodology.Â  The Tyrells are not the Lannisters.Â  They are a fusion of Lannisters+Starks.Â  They are as crafty, clever and politically aware as the Lannisters, but still with a moral center of Duty and Justice like the Starks.Â  Not as "good" as the Starks, but wayyyyy less evil than the Lannisters.Â  The thing is: The Starks were too good.Â  They were so "good" that they were blind to the reality of the world, and ultimately that is what defeated them.Â  The Tyrells represent "as good as you can realistically be" in this world.
Â 
The Tyrells don't want to "Muhahahah RULE!"Â  They want to rule because they understand that they alone (at this point in history) have what it takes to actually (and justly) rule the Seven Kindgoms.Â  Remember Olenna's comment last season about "squirting the milk back up the udder"?Â  Everything's gone to pot, and Olenna realizes that if the Tyrells DON'T act to restore things, they are guilty by complicity.Â  They recognize the danger.Â  They don't want to be in this situation.Â  They wish none of this had ever happened...Joffery, the war, the Starks, the famine, etc
Â 
When they came to Kingslanding, they bid their time.Â  They studied everyone.Â  Gears were turning.Â  They even called Sansa in to talk with her... because Sansa is a wildcard.Â  It was VERY important they understood Sansa's motivation, and MOST importantly: Is Sansa a Power-player?
Â 
They realized that NO she isn't and they repeatedly tested her on this to be sure.Â  She's just an innocent daughter of a man that himself was too innocent to recognize the danger.Â  They realize Sansa is in an EXTREMELY dangerous situation, and they decide that if they can, they will try to help her.Â  Legitimately.Â  But also, helping Sansa is not their primary purpose for being here and they won't sacrifice their main goal for her...nor should they...ending Joffery's rule and the war ARE more important than the life of one girl.
Â 
So first Olenna tried to marry Sansa off to Loras.Â  This would have been a "win-win" situation.Â  Yes, the Tyrells would gain the "Keys to the North" but Sansa would get her fairytale story AND would be out of KL and out of the power-plays.Â  I don't fault the Tyrells for gaining something in this arrangement.Â  Arranged marriages are usually mutually beneficial, and the Tyrells weren't shafting the Starks.
Â 
When that fell through, Olenna worked Sansa into the main plan of killing Joffery.Â  Again not for a scapegoat, but for JUSTICE.Â  Olenna explains her motives as she's taking the jewel from Sansa.Â  Listen to Olenna talking.Â  "What sort of monster kills a man at a wedding?"Â  Notice she's condemming Joffery and also implicating herself.Â  Joffery is a monster...but so is Olenna (for what she's about to do), and as Tyrion says: "Monsters Are Dangerous."
Â 
Olenna thought the Lannister actions were so reprehinsible that the instrument of their destruction NEEDED to pass through Stark hands. But she isn't scapegoating Sansa because she's set up an escape plan for her.Â  Olenna CARES about Sansa and is getting her out of this place, but only after justice is done.
Â 
Notice several things:Â  Tyrion is being followed.Â  So is Bron.Â  The Lannisters know about Shae (Sansa's handmaiden), very likely the Tyrells do too.Â  But Dontos isn't the type the Lannisters respect or fear.Â  They AREN'T watching him, and Olenna knows this.Â  Olenna misdirected everyone with the bit about her handmaidens getting a good necklace ("Tell the who you are and tell them who I am") .Â  Noone suspects anything.Â  It just seems like she wanted a nice necklace for the wedding, but no doubt they brought back MANY necklaces for her to choose..(and modify.)Â  Then Olenna plants a necklace on Sansa via Dontos (with no one noticing) and when events transpire, Dontos (apparently stone sober) shows up to save Sansa.
Â 
The QoT is absolutely brilliant and has escalated the game to a whole new level and at the same time struck a much needed blow for the good guys AND escaped blame herself AND got Sansa out of Dodge.Â  The ONLY bad thing that happened was that Tyrion got blamed, which was not her intent, but Tyrion is probably the best equipped to get out of the situation, certainly better equipped than Sansa.

We don't actually know how the Tyrells feel about Sansa except she'd be acceptable to Book Willas. They don't really want to scapegoat her and I'm sure LF made his plan sound genius for keeping Margaery out of suspicion. Once Tyrion married Sansa they couldn't get her but they were given a plan that let them think she would be safe enough, though a pawn.
They don't give two shits about Tyrion, why should they? 
QoT is the Tyrell matriarch despite her  origins - in fact she chose the family she married into. Sort of like Walder Frey is the patriarch.
It was a nice demo of how a seemingly overdone fuss about necklaces in one episode might need a week or more to be made fully clear to the viewer.
We don't know if Bronn was followed, took Shae off as ordered, or what.  The writers could work it either way by now. TV Shae is not book Shae. I suppose someone will be high fiving if Shae returns on the back of an elk led by a guy with black hands and is strangled with Tyrion's Blackwater chain by Syrio Forel.

Â 
I think she was brilliant. Lena didn't miss a step, she had tears rolling down her cheeks after the initial shock. Cersei hates being perceived as weak and vulnerable - is it really that much of a stretch to believe she's trying to restrain herself (albeit with difficulty) in front of the public? By the looks of it the next episode picks up again from that scene, so there's still more reactions to come.

Â 
Exactly! Cersei's a champion at tamping down her visible emotions, at least in the show interpretation, in comparison to how much she wants to rip out throats and drink her foe's blood. So yeah, it's not impossible for her to hold back the screeching grief-wracked mayhem she likely feels, but it comes out in her shoving past Margaery, shoving Jaime away, and tears brimming that she forces herself to steady.Â 
Â 
I loooove all the itty-bitty acting moments!
Â 
Like, gawd, Iwan Rheon's expressions crack me up. His Ramsay isn't as Kaiju-esque brutal, but his sarcastic smile when he quips the hunted girl's created a problem says enough. Only for it to be tweaked when he's visibly on edge during Bolton's arrival, and shaken when Roose chastises him. Even his "Reek" comes out kind of hoarse at first. Plus, Theon trying not to puke when the girl's attacked by the dogs, and his flinchy little reactions when Roose says "Theon."Â

Â 
being wanted for regicidal murder limits where she can go. being a runaway hostage isn't remotely as limiting.
1095	PhoenixDark	2014-04-14	Great episode with lots of nice dialogue. You can really tell when Martin is writing, as well as Cogman. Both tend to have really compelling dialogue in their episodes.
Â 
I thought Ran's episode was kind of poorly argued this week, no offense. I too have complained about the lack of subtlety in the show but I felt it worked well in this episode. Also let us not forget that in the book Tyrion notes that Oberyn demands justice every single time he sees him. That's not what I would call subtle, and given that type of behavior I could definitely imagine Oberyn referring to Cersei as he did in the episode.
1096	nara	2014-04-14	Yeah I caught it
Put in a couple posts and got nothing.
At least I knew what I thought I saw was right though I thought Tywinn was using his arms to totally cover him.


I saw your comment, but was still not able to spot it on review.Â  I must not be looking close enough!Â 
ETA:Â  I finally saw it.Â  Wow, you must watch the show frame by frame to have caught that! 
Â 
Â 
On another note, it just occurred to me that since we don't have Taena Merrywether, there needs to be someone else who lies about seeing Tyrion put the poison in the cup.Â  In the book, Taena and Shae are the only ones who truly lie in trial--others twist the truth and tell half-truths.Â  Perhaps they will combine them for now and Shae will lie about seeing Tyrion place the poison--either out of spite/woman-scornedness (yes, I know that's not a word) or to save her own life from Cersei/Tywin.Â  That would definitely make Tyrion want to kill her!

Yes. That is correct. In the books Ramsey disguised as Reek even brought the Starks boys clothes & Brans wolf pin to dress the dead boys in. It was all his idea

Not really.Â  The world is still divided into people who support the Iron Throne, and people who are potential allies and thus either don't care or actively approve of her supposedly killing Joffrey.
Â 
And again, the hairnet makes no difference in that anyway.

1103	Spotted Cat	2014-04-14	Yes. That is correct. In the books Ramsey disguised as Reek even brought the Starks boys clothes & Brans wolf pin to dress the dead boys in. It was all his idea



oh hell yaÂ 
he didnt need to torture theon for that. ramsey torturers people for the fun of it. Â more and more slips.Â
1104	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-04-14	Jaime has too much pride to reveal who took his hand. He's not gonna run to his father like a little pussy to deal with this. If any Lannister dishes out vengeance against Locke, it'll be Jaime himself.
Â 
But I don't see that happening.
1105	kaanchanoone	2014-04-14	Did anyone catch the face that appeared in/near the throne in Bran's vision of the snow covered throne room?Â  I am re-watching the episode now and I still missed it.
Ooooh I've been wondering the same thing. Tried to rewatch it but couldn't really tell who the mystery face was. If you have any idea, will you lommy know?

Â 
Oh, Jaime's gotta eventually have at least one left-handed fight in him before this song comes to an end.Â  
Â 
At the right time, for the right reason, and it might ultimately be his heroic sacrifice, but he'll do it.Â  Wanting to "pay his debt" to Locke seems as good a reason/motivation as any, at least at first, when he's failing badly and it'd be easy to give up/I'll never be able to do this, but that'll keep him going.
Â 
Maybe he'll even kill Locke so we believe in Southpaw Jaime enough to be devastated when he falls in battle the next time.
1107	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-04-14	Well he's definitely capable but the odds of him and Locke running into each other again are slim.
1108	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-14	I think Locke will die north of the Wall, or in the Battle at The Wall.
1109	Salad Days Saan	2014-04-14	Locke trudges around the North looking for Stark Boys.
Â 
Brienne trudges around the North/Riverlands looking for Stark Girls.
Â 
Jaime follows Brienne around because why not?
Â 
Brienne and Locke chase a similar rumor, end up in the same place, cross paths.Â  Thus, Jaime runs into Locke.

[spolers]Â 
this is how it really wentÂ 
"Lord Tywin pushed himself out of his chair, breath hissing between his teeth. â<U+0080><U+009C>Who did this? If Lady Catelyn thinksâ<U+0080><U+0094>â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>Lady Catelyn held a sword to my throat and made me swear to return her daughters. This was your goatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s work. Vargo Hoat, the Lord of Harrenhal!â<U+0080><U+009D>"Â 
so jamie actually told his father. lord tywin would have tortured the goat. only that the mountain has already done the torturing .Â 
in the show though, lord tywin dosnt even ask about the hand. very carelessly done HBO Â

We know that Brienne bites someones ear off this season. Seeing as how Biter and Rorge aren't associated with her story in the show, perhaps Locke will be her confrontation? The only problem is if Locke does reach The Wall (I'm sure it's been confirmed that he does), I just can't see him leaving it alive.
1115	rmholt	2014-04-14	Great episode with lots of nice dialogue. You can really tell when Martin is writing, as well as Cogman. Both tend to have really compelling dialogue in their episodes.
Â 
... let us not forget that in the book Tyrion notes that Oberyn demands justice every single time he sees him. That's not what I would call subtle, and given that type of behavior I could definitely imagine Oberyn referring to Cersei as he did in the episode.

Generally they hope he'll get to make some contribution to the fight against the Others, and die (or else, defeat the Boltons, etc.).Â  Liking a character and believing he'd be the best choice for the throne isn't the same thing as believing he's actually going to win.Â  If anything, for a lot of people it adds to the tragic aura (how many Jaime fans really expect him to survive the series?).

One must wonder whether he will explode from the torment of a Targ returning since he had a tough time resolving the concept of a Robert being King. At least a few enamel fragments should fly out of his mouth.
He'll get North as he did in the books, via the souls of burned banner men, expell^H ^ H blowing him there so to speak

Are you TS? I understand where you're coming from. I'm team Arya, but I don't know if she'd make a great Queen. Maybe so since she doesn't want it. Honestly, Tyrion would probably be the best. I know there has to be some Stannis fans out there though that are at least holding on too a little hope that he'll be seated upon the throne in end. I'm the same way with Jon. He looks pretty much next to dead right now, but that doesn't keep me from holding out hope that he is going to make it somehow.

1154	pantouflas	2014-04-15	Reading the EW articles, I came across this:
Charlies Dance (Tywin Lannister) on how Joffreys death impacts Tywins plans: Well, it hasnt come a moment too soon, really. It does help Tywin, because Ive sorted out who I want to marry who. Its all about maintaining the status quo really  making sure the Lannisters stay up there. Whether its getting help from the Dornish or the Tyrells, the most prominent house in the seven kingdoms is the house of Lannister, so I have to do whatever it takes to make sure that that situation stays. And way over in the east theres these continuous rumors about this Targaryan girl with her dragons that Im trying not to think about  lets cross that bridge when we come to it. But now that weve got Joffrey out of the way, the young man that I want to put on the throne I can put on the throne  the death of Joffrey is fortuitous because he was kind of like a little mosquito anyway  annoying, that youre swatting all the time.
Who thinks he was in from the beginning? (I don't remember any hints in the books, but this doesn't mean he wasn't)

Oh wow. It becomes more and more difficult to blindly hate any character. I started out despising Cersei. Until her POV chapters.
Thats one reason why I love these books so much. You get an insight into the heart of every character. Even Ramsay Snow.
The only exception seems to be Gregor Clegane. He is a brute. And no one can explain why.
1156	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-15	So I finally got around to re-watching this episode, and damn - I honestly feel like Joffrey's death is the single most uncomfortable moment on the show for me thus far. Just like in the books, it's this odd mixture of "Yes, it's finally happening!" and horror of a boy choking to death in the arms of his mother, while she watches him die in fear and agony.
Â 
It's strange. I know the big story for everyone is that Joffrey is dead, and everyone's celebrating about his long overdue comeuppance; but just like in the books, it never truly felt like a victory for me. So credit (again) to GRRM, Jack Gleeson, Lena Headey, and the rest of the cast & crew who crafted that scene.
Â 
Joffrey's death is horrifying, and makes me squirm just as much as a certain child's death in The Wire. You know a book/show is good when you actually feel sorry for one of the biggest monsters in the story.

Well, he had Sansa. She didn't say much but she said everything with only her murder stare. Also, we don't see that in books but we do see here that people was pretty much horrified by Joffrey's behaviour towards his uncle.

Anyway, I just rewatched the Stannis, CrazyDee and CrazyDum scene again and
Â 
1. Some bits of Stannis deadpan humour:

"There is nothing else"
"Serve fish, we're on an island" (#1)
"You hate fish"
"I hate many others things (like you) but here we are" (#2)

Yeah, I'm the same.Â  If GRRM wanted people to really think about "this is a child dying!" or whatever (even though, in the show, he's like 17-18 at this point), he really needed to actually write Joffrey as a human being at some point, rather than a cartoonish, one-dimensional sociopath.Â  Joffrey's perfectly suited to the role of horrible villain, but he's about as much of complicated statement on the human condition as Ramsay Snow.
1162	Olvyr	2014-04-15	...Then Olenna plants a necklace on Sansa via Dontos (with no one noticing) and when events transpire, Dontos (apparently stone sober) shows up to save Sansa.
Â 
Need to recheck this, but in S04E01, the scene where the QoT throws a neclace into the bushes (dismissing it as not nice enough) couldn't that have been her way of leaving it there for Dontos to retrieve it. That way noone could have seen Qot/Donto/Sansa together with the necklace...
1163	Nictarion	2014-04-15	Â 
Yeah, I know...and it sucksÂ  


Yeah, I hadn't realised but that probably means Loras isn't going to join the KG. I dont know why, but that hadnt previously dawned on me.

Â 
You're right! Guess I was in denial about that as well. Now I wonder if they'll give him some of Willas' or Garlan's supposed big roles that GRRM mentioned or if they'll have him go to Dragonstone and get injured (or "injured")
1166	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-15	Forgot to ask. What does Stannis mean by "meat's off"?. Don't get it, me not speaks american.

Â 
I thought they were still nudging in the direction of Loras joining the Kingsguard, actually. Seemed like they were hinting at it during Loras and Jaime's confrontation, as it would also prevent the marriage from happening and allow Loras to be close to Margaery.
Â 
We'll see anyway. I'm not entirely sure how they'll handle the Tyrells moving forward into AFFC territory.

Â 
I know, I was just thinking in terms of how they'll end the marriage pact between Cersei and Loras. I suppose he can still run off for his heroic siege of Dragonstone, but it would just seem more foolhardy now that he's the heir.
1174	BlueDragon	2014-04-15	Â 
What? That's where the poison came from. The poison is ingrained within the chalice itself after Olenna dropped it in . Sublimation friend.Â 


Â You are so wrong. Â Read the book. Â Although we don't have confessions yet, Olena was clearly trying to rid her precious granddaughter of a monster husband. Â I am going to bet Margarey regrets how the poisoning went down, but Tommen is such a happy replacement Olena may convince M that she will still be queen. Â This is when Csecei goes ballistic with jealousy and just can't let the third royal marriage go forward, but I bet it does. Â Tomen is someone Margarie won't need to manipulate as much. Â If Csercei goes in for her book manipulations, Marg may have trial trouble, Â I ,Â
1175	TheReal_Rebel	2014-04-15	My stomach is in knots thinking that Rickon & Osha while heading south for the Umbers in the show (but for Skagos in the books )might run into Locke as he heads north.
Is this a possibility?

1176	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-15	But seriously...what was with that infidel line...
I don't much like Stannis even in the books (I should die, I know) but they really made him sound like a fanatic here.


I dunno if i'd say Fanatic, especially when you compare him to seleyse and Mel in the same scene. Seleyse had the crazy eyes, while Stannis looked like he was meeting his in laws.
1177	KeeperOfOaths	2014-04-15	Â 
Oh and one last thing. With having Jaime and Brienne arrive in KL so early, I thought they would actually have Jaime idly stand by while Joff died. Jaime has said in the books that he shows no paternal instinct towards Joffrey and does not consider the kids his, only Cersei's. So that combined with what an asshole Joff was to him last week (about his hand, then insults him with the book), then, I can't remember at what specifically, but Joff was being Joff again, and they showed a clip of Jaime rolling his eyes or something at him. I just KNEW he was going to stand there and do nothing when Joff dies, so it was out of character for him to rush in. Regardless of if he's in the white cloaks or not, and I knew it would throw a wrench into his relationship with Cersei. HE changes their relationship by turning him down. He's on a path to redemption and the showrunners are leaving out sooo many of his redeeming qualities. So the Unsullied look at me like I'm crazy when I say I like Jaime (yes he tried to kill a child and nothing changes that, but his story is interesting!) or when I say I want Stannis to be King (because look at how they portray him on the show).Â 
Â 
Ok, back to the show!


Â 
I am confused. You seem to say that because Jaime seems to care-at least a little- that Jeoffrey dies, he loses some of his redeeming qualities. IsnÂ´t it supossed to be the other way around? Jeoffrey is JaimeÂ´s son, afterall. WouldnÂ´t it look like Jaime is a total jerk if he doesnÂ´t care at all about his son????? Mad and horrible as this son may be.
Â 
Besides Jaime is also the Commander of the KG. He could not stay there and do nothing. I thought that him rushing to Jeoffrey was a nice touch. I didnÂ´t like the way they filmed the scene, though. The scene seemed comical. And Jaime a little bit of a fool; as in not being able to doÂ his job and protect the king.
1178	kaanchanoone	2014-04-15	I dunno if i'd say Fanatic, especially when you compare him to seleyse and Mel in the same scene. Seleyse had the crazy eyes, while Stannis looked like he was meeting his in laws.

Oh ya. True. Seleyse was almost orgasmic...
1179	Lyanna Stark	2014-04-15	Random, but did anyone else miss Garlan Tyrell? I honestly don't know how Tyrion could have made it through that entire wedding without Good Guy Garlan being extra nice to him to counterbalance all the shit Joff was throwing his way
Â 
(And bummer, I would have loved to see the "Garlan put the poison in the cup" theory confirmed in the show)


Â 
Â 
Yeah I know right? I still remember Ragnorak being saddened by the "Garlan the Not So Gallant" theory. 
Â 
Â 
Still, I normally find the difference between the novels and TV show jarring, but I do think they got most of the nuances just right with this episode.
Â 
- Sansa's grief was so obvious and it was also obvious that everyone at the wedding (minus the Lannisters perhaps) knew about it. Especially the scene where the wolf's head was lopped off the dwarf fighters was just heartbreaking.  Making Olenna's throwing Sansa under the bus together with Tyrion even colder.
Â 
-Olenna murdering Joffrey was brilliantly done, you could see her fussing over Sansa, then zoom to the necklace missing a stone and then zoom again to Olenna just before Joffrey picked up his cup. It was also plain that the murder would be pinned on Sansa+Tyrion with how they both touched the cup before Jofffey took it. Neatly explained.
Â 
- LOL to all the "Jaime and Brienne are just friends" romance haters. There must have been some teeth grinding there.
Â 
- Stannis the Kinslayer. I wonder if this is a setup so that Stannis' darker path will have a proper turn at the end of the season when he gets to rescue Jon Snow? It's also pretty clear that he is being lead by Melisandre as she is his only key to beat the odds, you might say. Even if it jarred that he called Ser Axel Florent "infidel", I still think the spirit of the burning is not all wrong. Old Stannis (pre-Mel) would not have burnt Ser Axel. Her influence on him is not all that healthy.
Â 
- Is this the end of Tyrion the white washed? Here was saw a bit of Holier Than Thou and Better Than Thou attitude a la my Lord of Lannister just like his self-deceptive relationship with Shae in the novels.
1180	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-15	I think it shows they careless. In book, there is many people around the King helping him. Here, it's only Joffrey's parents and they both pushed people aside to get him. If people kept having doubts, well, they have none now.
Â 
Also, Jaime calls him "Joffrey". Not "my King" or "Your Highness". "Joffrey". I mean, come one. He might claim he doesn't care but it's his son nevertheless. Jaime says what he says in books because he wasn't there to watch him die but now he's starting to be closer to the kids he's having feelings.

Yeah, I liked that little touch. Also having he and Cersei being the ones holding Joff, until Cersei pushes Jaime away.

Where? With Shae? Not really. I doubt that that'll be seen as anything other than him Nymeria-ing her-for her own good of course.It's not like the idea of him settling down with Sansa is even slightly credible.Â 
Â 
Joff? Nah, he's just an idiot there and has always been.

1184	Niamhikus	2014-04-15	No one missed that scene - you could see that all the stones were still there.
Â 
Unless that was the reason they changed the stones to pale blue instead of deep purple, so we would miss the fact a stone was missing.


I am fairly certain that the last blue stone, closesest to sansas left was missing, my brother and me where watching like hawks.

Thanks for this. I was looking hard in the show at the part where QoT plucked the crystal, but the TV did not show it clearly. So the years old "mystery" is solved then. Read a GRRM interview and he (kinda) confirmed it's QoT as well.
Â 
On reflection, it's really funny how GRRM decided to reveal the plot to the reader through Littlefinger's conversation to Sansa in the books. But as readers, we did not really believe Littlefinger and it became a mystery to be speculated on for years instead. Hah. I'm glad I'm getting some closure on this issue! *tears up*Â
1188	DemiNymph	2014-04-15	There was no mystery. It was all in our minds! We spectulated all these years for nothing!

I hope it was CH.Watching again last night I could finally see the necklace retainers for that gem were clearly empty.Missed that totally first viewing.I am still confused about who put the Strangler stone in the cup , I swear it looks like both Marg or Sansa could have done from hand movements. Olenna because of looks and body language , but her deed is off screen.I will note this.Huffpost TV ... Interview:Q:So you think that if we rewatch the episode, weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll be able to catch who the murderer is?Alan Taylor : No, if you watch it again you wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t catch it. But if you analyze it, and you know who did it and how they did it -- which is another whole thing -- it tracks. And thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s all I can say.
1192	KeeperOfOaths	2014-04-15	So, I have finally managed to read pretty much the entire thread (still 10 pages left ) and here are the things I liked about the episode, more or less in the order the scenes appeared in the show.
Â 
1. Ramsay/Reek/Bolton/Locke/Wanda/Miranda interaction. I am not a fan of the whole Dreadfort subplot. I care very little about book Theon and even less about show Theon-I donÂ´t understand the whole Alfie!!!!!!!! thing. And I think that Ramsey is creepy as hell. He may be even worse than Jeoffrey. But I liked the Dreadfort scenes in this episode. The chase in the woods was sinister. So was RamseyÂ´s smile when he greeted Wanda (who was actually kind of sweet). The interaction between Ramsey and Locke was very good- two creepy guys, of course they would get alone very well. The scene where Ramsey shows his power over Reek was brilliantly written and acted. And I LOVED ReekÂ´s face when he finds out Robb is dead. I loved this moment. Especially since we didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t get to see JonÂ´s first reaction to this death, I love that we at least could see ReekÂ´s reaction. And the fact that he did care about Robb. I also thought it did some more justice to RobbÂ´s character. To see that he has been loved. Miss him; beautiful, sweet boy.
2. STANNIS.
Oh yes, I know that his fans are outraged and speak of his characterÂ´s assassination. But I like him in the show. Even more than in the books. The scenes in episode 2 were very nice. I liked the expression of StannisÂ´s face during the entire scene. You could actually see that he was not into the burning stuff. It is just another thing that he has to endure because, well, he is Stannis and he is stern as hell. Has to do whatever it takes to reach his objective. I liked the part where he defends Shireen. I liked the sarcasm of Davos- simply love him. And I think that Selyse is creepy as hell. I donÂ´t like her in the books and even less in the show. So yes, Stannis was great this episode. I also find interesting how every time we move to Dragonstone everything is so dark and gloomy. And yes, Shireen rocks. Such a nice girl.
Â 
3. Jaime/Tyrion. I liked their dynamic. I liked that for all of JaimeÂ´s bravado in front of Jeoffrey and Tywin last episode, he is aware that he can no longer fight and Tyrion is the only one in whom he trusts with this piece of information. I liked seeing how depressed Jaime is because of this situation; because he is so getting down until he reaches bottom in the next episode with the sept scene and then he will start to raise again. IÂ´ve loved to see Tyrion being protective and supportive of Jaime. Because from now on we will see the exact opposite: Jaime defending Tyrion. Also, a nice parallel: Tyrion serves Jaime wine out of his own initiative. Minutes later Jeoffrey orders Tyrion to pours him wine.
Â 
4. Brienne/Jaime. I loved that she acknowledged the fact that he saved her twice. I loved her smile when she spoke of Jaime and their "adventures" as if it was a private joke they had. And I loved seeing Cercei getting jealous.
Â 
5. Loras/Jaime. I loved the interaction, although generally I want Jaime to be the one who gets the upper hand. But they have done such a terrible job with show Loras, that I liked seeing him get the final word this time. I also liked the fact that Jaime does not threaten Loras directly. he says that Cercei will be the one to murder Loras. Also, I found nice the reference to Cercei murdering any children she might have with Loras. DidnÂ´t she do the same thing with her child with Robert? I donÂ´t remember exactly.
Â 
6. OBERYN. He simply rocked.
Â 
7. Sansa. very nice acting. I felt so badly for her. And I cheered up when she managed to remain composed throughout the entire 5 kings scene.
Â 
8. Jaime/Jeoffrey. I liked that he was there when Jeoffrey died. I didnÂ´t like very much the way the "rushing to his side" scene was filmed. But it think it was a nice touch that both parents were there when he died.
Â 
9. CERCEI. So in book character during the entire episode. Finally we get to the insane Cercei part. The fact that she prefers the food being given to the dogs, just so that Margaery doesnÂ´t do what she wants- who cares about the starved people, right?. Her dialogue with Brienne. The fact that even in her pain for her sonÂ´s death, she is still overcome by hate and vanity, and jealousy. She turns immediately on Tyrion instead of just crying for her child. And she shouts to Jaime to stay away from Jeoffrey. Why was that? Such a bitch! I canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t stand her.
1193	Mithras	2014-04-15	I also liked the mention of wolfsbane as a possible name for Joffrey's sword. Wolfsbane is a poison mentioned in the books but its function is not explained. It is a real poison and I suspect we may have some uses of it in the books.
1194	Dornishwoman's Husband	2014-04-15	Two things I liked the most in this episode were the dwarf performance and Joffrey's purple face when he started to choke.
Lady Olena really exposed to risk, when she put a poison in Joffrey's cup. Margery could also drink from it. I wonder if Sansa will be accused for poisoning, too.
1195	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-15	Ha, Alan Taylor is building up the mystery of the poisoner while GRRM just spills the beans!
1196	nara	2014-04-15	Quick question. Is the blonde chap sitting beside Tyrion at the feast supposed to be Tommen or Lancel? I thought he might be too old for Tommen but have they aged him up?Â 


Â 
Tommen --new actor.Â  He does look older than the last boy, but perhaps they felt it was better to have a slightly older boy to marry Marg (particularly since she is played by an actress who is 30--I think).Â  I think he's meant to be 11-12Â  in the show.

what can Â happen in episode 10 that isso effects heavy? The stuff at The Vale?
1200	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-15	The Episode 10 stuff would have to deal with the caging of the dragons, so they may cause a bit of trouble in or around Meereen too. Also, I don't know how crazy they're going to go with Leaf and Bloodraven either, but perhaps it could have a bit to do with Bran's story - a vision maybe?
1201	ladyinblack	2014-04-15	Need to recheck this, but in S04E01, the scene where the QoT throws a neclace into the bushes (dismissing it as not nice enough) couldn't that have been her way of leaving it there for Dontos to retrieve it. That way noone could have seen Qot/Donto/Sansa together with the necklace...


I wondered about that too
1202	ovis alba	2014-04-15	Maybe it's the combination of stuff that makes it so complicated: The dragons getting out of control, probably still some Wall stuff that just involves tons of people, Bran can get very CGI-intensive I guess, also depending if they maybe open up the "door to the past" as one could call it, a certain Lady will probably also show up and should need some serious make-up  , Arya probably needs a ship, maybe the Eyrie needs to be in, too.
I can't actually think of ONE big event that would be so complicated, but I guess, getting everything in, with each of the stories being not so straight forward or some of them being CGI intensive or just a location that has not been used so far or not in a long time, might add up from the prodcution point of view
1203	Phil Sand	2014-04-15	Sansa is missing a gem from her necklace right after lady olena plays with her hair in the scene where olena tells sansa she should come to high garden, also after the pie comes out while everyone is distracted margery puts the wine intront of olena.
1204	Phil Sand	2014-04-15	Â

Thats totally BS.Â  Stannis was never religious, he only uses Mel as a means to an end, he's never a believer himself.Â  WTF.Â  Fucking horrible.Â 
Â 
I think the thing that confuses me the most is that it was GRRM who wrote this episode.Â  Why would he change Stannis like that...


To be fair Stannis executed them for not obeying his command.
You don't want to say no to stannis.
1205	Elaena Targaryen	2014-04-15	Yeah, I hadn't realised but that probably means Loras isn't going to join the KG. I dont know why, but that hadnt previously dawned on me.


Â 
Well that's one confusing thing since in the show Loras was a member of Renly's KG, wasn't he?
Â 
Then we have the scene with Tywin and the QoT where she agrees to the match with Cersei so Loras, the HGÂ heir,Â will not be forced into the KG, right?
Â 
I have no idea what they areÂ doing :shrugs:
Â 
Are they ignoring what has come before, or was the QoT just manipulating Tywin while she plots, or was the QoT too worried to have Loras that close to Joffrey considering what he thinks of Loras, or did she really not want him to give up his titles, orÂ idk...

1206	Dany's Silver	2014-04-15	I ended up really enjoying this episode, especially now that I have rewatched it without a myriad of questions from my Unsullied friends and family. [I liked the suggestion made by someone earlier than Summer Children would be a better term for non-book readers!] The biggest complaint I have is the fact that we don't see Tyrion figure out that Joffrey was responsible for the attempt on Bran's life. I get that it's more difficult to show this on TV than in the books, but a wordless glance from Tyrion after Joffrey says that he's familiar with Valyrian steel would work if Tyrion has a subsequent conversation with Varys. Otherwise, I can usually keep the book's canon separate from its televised version and not mind too much, but that was one pay off I enjoyed in the books and would like to have seen televised.
1207	Onna Lewyys	2014-04-15	Â 
Well that's one confusing thing since in the show Loras was a member of Renly's KG, wasn't he?
YES, THANK YOU. I'm so happy that someone else realized this. It makes no sense whatsoever.Â 
It really doesn't, it could easily be in the top Â left corner(her right) of her neckline hidden behind her robe + hair.Â 
Â 
So who do we think spoke to Bran? I hope it was CH.
You're looking at the wrong side. Look to our right/Sansa's left.
And it was Bloodraven, speaking to him through the weirwood.
1208	Mad Danny	2014-04-15	Ooh l kl
Lpp lo p I

1209	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-15	YES, THANK YOU. I'm so happy that someone else realized this. It makes no sense whatsoever.

yeah the Jewel is for sure missing , not hidden by hair or anything.
1210	Greywolf2375	2014-04-15	Â 
Thanks for this. I was looking hard in the show at the part where QoT plucked the crystal, but the TV did not show it clearly. So the years old "mystery" is solved then. Read a GRRM interview and he (kinda) confirmed it's QoT as well.
Â 
On reflection, it's really funny how GRRM decided to reveal the plot to the reader through Littlefinger's conversation to Sansa in the books. But as readers, we did not really believe Littlefinger and it became a mystery to be speculated on for years instead. Hah. I'm glad I'm getting some closure on this issue! *tears up*Â 


Well, not really.Â  The mystery is basically solved for the show, but for the books it isn't - there were other players (Garlan for example) that had opportunity in the books that aren't presentÂ in the show.Â  Also in the books the chalice was where the poison was and it seems unlikely QoT would have been able to reach into it.Â
1211	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-04-15	Watching again last night I could finally see the necklace retainers for that gem were clearly empty.
Missed that totally first viewing.
I am still confused about who put the Strangler stone in the cup , I swear it looks like both Marg or Sansa could have done from hand movements. Olenna because of looks and body language , but her deed is off screen.
I will note this.
Huffpost TV ... Interview:
Q:So you think that if we rewatch the episode, weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll be able to catch who the murderer is?
Alan Taylor : No, if you watch it again you wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t catch it. But if you analyze it, and you know who did it and how they did it -- which is another whole thing -- it tracks. And thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s all I can say.


Â 
I think this website summed up pretty nicely who killed Joff based on TV observations only.

1212	Talking Hodor	2014-04-15	Cutting from Theon to a sausage is just wrong.


What? That was the perfect segue! I've started to notice how intentional and logical the cuts from one scene to another are - it's especially important since the story is so fragmented over two continents.
1213	Talking Hodor	2014-04-15	Who the hell was that woman hunting with Ramsay?


I think she, and the hunted, were the two chicas that were prepping Theon for his emasculation in Season 3.
1214	Talking Hodor	2014-04-15	Fat Walda is actually fat!!!
I thought they cast a skinny actress so I'm glad to see she's not.


Yeah, it's super hard finding fat people to play parts in TV shows.
Â 
Seriously?Â  Casting a skinny person would be downright confusing and fly in the face of everything mentioned in the books and TV shows so far.
1215	Eddard the Builder	2014-04-15	Interesting that this Unsullied blog doesn't suspect the QoTs
http://metro.co.uk/2...dunnit-4698268/
1216	ovis alba	2014-04-15	It's especially interesting as they suspect basically everyone else. I mean Shae? Really? It never even occured to me?

					
					
							Edited by ovis alba, 15 April 2014 - 09:40 AM.
1217	Talking Hodor	2014-04-15	Two things I liked the most in this episode were the dwarf performance and Joffrey's purple face when he started to choke.
Lady Olena really exposed to risk, when she put a poison in Joffrey's cup. Margery could also drink from it. I wonder if Sansa will be accused for poisoning, too.


Pretty sure Margaery knows not to touch that particular cup.
1218	Talking Hodor	2014-04-15	Â 
Tommen --new actor.Â  He does look older than the last boy, but perhaps they felt it was better to have a slightly older boy to marry Marg (particularly since she is played by an actress who is 30--I think).Â  I think he's meant to be 11-12Â  in the show.


I get the impression that in the show, one year passes for each season.Â  I read somewhere that Joffrey was supposed to be 19.Â  He was like 17 two years ago. Yes, I know he was around 13 in the books.
1219	Woman of War	2014-04-15	Thing is, the hairnet doesn't connect her to the murder anymore than her fleeing the city, because nobody knows about the hairnet, and the Tyrells couldn't bring it up without inviting questions about how they know that.Â  Also, Sansa really did not need more incentive to leave the city than she already had.
.
But Sansa knows! She believes to have had a part in murdering Joffrey, she will believe that everyone knows and that makes her emotionally dependent of Baelish. She has to thank him now for giving her shelter and she has to believe that she will never be free of that murder accusation. If now Baelish might make her believe that she has a part in Robin's death then he absolutely has her in his pockets emotionally. And physically because she'd have nowhere to go. As Sansa she poisoned the king, as Alayne she believes herself to have killed the boy. Catch 22, LF's perfect tool.
1220	Talking Hodor	2014-04-15	Forgot to ask. What does Stannis mean by "meat's off"?. Don't get it, me not speaks american.


They're running out of good meat since they're kinda besieged, which means they're probably down to grilling old gym mats.
Â 
In 32 episodes, I have yet to hear one iota of American English.
1221	Onna Lewyys	2014-04-15	I get the impression that in the show, one year passes for each season.Â  I read somewhere that Joffrey was supposed to be 19.Â  He was like 17 two years ago. Yes, I know he was around 13 in the books.
That works for some storylines, like KL, but not others. Because in that case, it took Bran & co. an entire year to walk from Winterfell to the Wall.
1222	pantouflas	2014-04-15	Yes, it does mean he wasn't, because that makes no sense, and it wouldn't have any meaning at this point in the story anyway.

What makes no sense? That the best strategist in Westeros would not want to get rid of the worst king in years, who started the war by beheading Ned Stark and attempting to kill Bran? The guy who would probably get them all killed in the end, like the Mad King got all the Targaryens killed?? It's obvious even in the books that he was happy to have Tommen on the throne.
I have no idea what you mean with your second argument.

Â

Â 
Oberyn accusing the Lannister of being "slow on the draw" was an American idiom, I believe.
Â 
Given the primarily English/European cast (and crew?), American colloquialisms don't seep into the show that much.

Why doesn't Sansa just pull an Arya and shank Littlefinger a couple times with a sharp blade?
1225	The 10th Penny King	2014-04-15	A few topics of note:

Might have been addressed, but I didn't make it through all 60 pages of the thread since most of it focused on the necklace.

Do they have a reveal plan for Balon Greyjoy? Â They may touch on that when they get back to Yara or Moat Calon?

The 5 Kings mummers show - the Robb Stark dwarf has a very deep voice yelling "I'm the King of the North." Â -- doubtful that it will turn out to be Penny. Â Most likely, one of the performers will be her brother. Â The irony would be if the dwarf who played Joffrey turned out to be her brother (and subsequently killed because of Tyrion) - now she would seek vengeance for "Joff".

I'm a little disappointed that they ignored a Loras/Brienne confrontation. Â I expected a fight between them because Lora would still believe Brienne killed Renly. Â I guess that was covered by the Margaery/Brienne scene last week.

Speaking of Loras - they may wait until Cersei has complete power/control to dissolve her engagement with Loras and as a way to hurt the Tyrells - force him to join the Kingsguard to take away their only heir.
Â 
Thoughts?
1226	Eddard the Builder	2014-04-15	It's especially interesting as they suspect basically everyone else. I mean Shae? Really? It never even occured to me?

ShowLoras has already said (while looking at Renly's body) to both Margaery and LF that he doesn't believe Brienne had anything to do with Renly's death.
1229	Sam with Hooters	2014-04-15	Well, yeah, IMHO this is how Joffrey's death scene should've gone down:
Joffrey:Â  *choke,gag* (Points at Tyrion instead of vague "reaching" gesture).
Joffrey:Â  *dies*
Cersei:Â  (shriek) "He's dead!Â  My son is DEAD!" (hysterics)
(Camera pans out forÂ crowd reaction shot)
(END OF EPISODE, roll credits!).

Cersei total meltdown:Â  "You did this!! YOU KILLED MY SON!Â  Seize him!"

We've already had Viserys face melt, smash cut to credits; Ned Stark head chop, smash cut to credits; Jaime hand chop, smash cut to credits; Cat Stark throat slit, smash cut to credits; do we really need to criticize them for actually avoiding the hackneyed cliche this time around?
1240	Dany's Silver	2014-04-15	and how does Sansa fit into this? it's the sweet sleep given to Robyn on the way down to the Gates?? bc it's the only thing i can think of.

They are already giving him sweet sleep prior to the trip down from the Eyrie. The maester is worried that he has had too many doses already. I doubt that Sansa will be responsible for his death, but I think she'll know about LF's role, especially since she's heard the maester voice his concerns.

Agreed. It will be a moral dilemma for her, especially given how much she stands to gain from his death.
1242	Colonel Green	2014-04-15	What makes no sense? That the best strategist in Westeros would not want to get rid of the worst king in years, who started the war by beheading Ned Stark and attempting to kill Bran? The guy who would probably get them all killed in the end, like the Mad King got all the Targaryens killed?? It's obvious even in the books that he was happy to have Tommen on the throne.
I have no idea what you mean with your second argument.


As to the second argument, what would be the point in revealing that Tywin was involved now, at this point in the story?
Â 
As to the first, Tywin wouldn't even kill Tyrion, who he hated, until he seemed to be a regicide.Â  Even Roose Bolton fears kinslaying.Â  And if he did want to be rid of Joffrey, there were a million better ways to do it, ways that didn't squander valuable assets like Sansa.
1243	Woman of War	2014-04-15	Why doesn't Sansa just pull an Arya and shank Littlefinger a couple times with a sharp blade?Because she is Sansa and not Arya?
I'd certainly like Sansa to become more active but there are different ways of being active and I guess this would not be her approach.
Apart from that putting a character in that kind of ambiguous situation, letting said character simmer for a while and flirt with going over to the dark side simply makes a good story.
she has no reason for wanting LF death.Â  however, i don't understand why everyone believes LF wants to kill Robyn??I am not really sure if Baelish wants to kill Robin right now but I think it may happen by accident and Baelish may make use of it, morally handcuffing Sansa, or making Sansa his tool may at some point be more important than Little Lord Arryn alive.
And indeed, so far Sasa has little reason to distrust LF, she simply does not know what he did to her family. By now he is her, albeit somewhat sinister, benefactor, the man who saved her not only from a murder accusation but also from her mean aunt.
Coming back to the Arya comparison: Sansa could make use of her abilities and spy on Baelish, question people, read his letters....... whatever clever investigation could be done - if Martin wants her to become clever so soon.

1245	dbunting	2014-04-15	I can definitely see LF making sure Sweet Robin dies in the next book. His whole being wants power and if the person he is trying to use as a puppet, Sansa, is married to the Lord of the Vale, then LF is emmensely powerful. He could rally the North and use the army of the Vale to take Winterfell back. He will absolutely try to ensure Sweet Robin dies soon.
1246	kaanchanoone	2014-04-15	A few topics of note:
Might have been addressed, but I didn't make it through all 60 pages of the thread since most of it focused on the necklace.
Do they have a reveal plan for Balon Greyjoy? Â They may touch on that when they get back to Yara or Moat Calon?
The 5 Kings mummers show - the Robb Stark dwarf has a very deep voice yelling "I'm the King of the North." Â -- doubtful that it will turn out to be Penny. Â Most likely, one of the performers will be her brother. Â The irony would be if the dwarf who played Joffrey turned out to be her brother (and subsequently killed because of Tyrion) - now she would seek vengeance for "Joff".
I'm a little disappointed that they ignored a Loras/Brienne confrontation. Â I expected a fight between them because Lora would still believe Brienne killed Renly. Â I guess that was covered by the Margaery/Brienne scene last week.
Speaking of Loras - they may wait until Cersei has complete power/control to dissolve her engagement with Loras and as a way to hurt the Tyrells - force him to join the Kingsguard to take away their only heir.
Â 
Thoughts?

Regarding Loras and Brienne's confrontation -
IIRC When Renly dies Margaery says that Brienne of Tarth killed Loras and Loras says something like "I don't believe that. You don't believe that." He basically believes that Stannis killed Renly...so there wouldn't be a confrontation on the show.
1247	kaanchanoone	2014-04-15	ShowLoras has already said (while looking at Renly's body) to both Margaery and LF that he doesn't believe Brienne had anything to do with Renly's death.

Woops did not see this reply!
1248	raj34	2014-04-15	So I finally got around to re-watching this episode, and damn - I honestly feel like Joffrey's death is the single most uncomfortable moment on the show for me thus far. Just like in the books, it's this odd mixture of "Yes, it's finally happening!" and horror of a boy choking to death in the arms of his mother, while she watches him die in fear and agony.
Â 
It's strange. I know the big story for everyone is that Joffrey is dead, and everyone's celebrating about his long overdue comeuppance; but just like in the books, it never truly felt like a victory for me. So credit (again) to GRRM, Jack Gleeson, Lena Headey, and the rest of the cast & crew who crafted that scene.
Â 
Joffrey's death is horrifying, and makes me squirm just as much as a certain child's death in The Wire. You know a book/show is good when you actually feel sorry for one of the biggest monsters in the story.


Â 
Gleeson is too old to pull off the "he's a monster, but still only a child" angle. At least for me. I didn't feel uncomfortable about it at all.
1249	The 10th Penny King	2014-04-15	Regarding Loras and Brienne's confrontation -
IIRC When Renly dies Margaery says that Brienne of Tarth killed Loras and Loras says something like "I don't believe that. You don't believe that." He basically believes that Stannis killed Renly...so there wouldn't be a confrontation on the show.


Â 
Totally forgot about that scene.Â  It had such an impact in the book when they clash and Brienne was jailed, I think I ignored the show's divergence.Â
1250	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-15	Last night after I rewatched the scene in Dragonstone, I came to the conclusion that DD want us to put our eyes on Shireen and Stannis, rather than anything R'hllor or mel related. I wrote yesterday that Selyse simply looks jelous of Shireen and I think that's what DD wants us to think as well, whatever their reasons are: copypasting from another thread:
Â 
- Stannis is clearly disgusted by everything around him, including Davos. Shireen is not there, though. He probably doesn't want her around the whole mess that it's his life. Shireen's absence means to me that for Stannis, the world now is divided in two things: everything he hates and Shireen. And Shireen doesn't mix with the things he hates.
- Selyse also disgusts him. He didn't say it with words, but he's pretty much implying that she might be his wife but that's all. She even tries to recall what she might perceive as a caring act of Stannis, but he barely reacts to the memory: "of course I remember", like "well, duh, I was there".
- She changes the conversation to the lord of light and Stannis is all "meh". He pays attention when Selyse baits him with something she knows he cares: Shireen, and then she calls her a "stubborn little beast". That doesn't sound like something she would say simply because Shireen refuses to "convert". To me, it looks like she actually dislikes the girl, maybe because of the greyscale, maybe because she's a girl. Or maybe...
Â 
- Selyse states that Stannis thinks Shireen's sweet because she smiles at him. While in the previous dialogue is clear that Stannis barely pays attention to his wife besides his marital duties of feeding her and keeping her safe, Shireen doesn't need to do anything but to smile to have Stannis' attention and love, something Selyse doesn't have.
Â - Selyse also calls Shireen "sullen, subborn and sinful". She's pretty much describing Stannis right there. It's Selyse the one who doesn't know Stannis.
Â The whole scene is quite symbolic because of the dialogue and the food scenery: Selyse is starving from Stannis' favour and she's unable to provide him with anything he likes ("the meat's off, get something else"). She even got him a women who promises him being King and he's still unhappy. Stannis complains about the food while Selyse simply eats it in silence and tries to do her best with the few she has: that's their marriage. And when Melisandre speaks of suffering hunger as a child until the Lord of Light found her, that's Selyse right there, being hungry of something else (love) until Melisandre found her.

Â 
LOL, I see lots of blue reflections in there, not sure where it's coming from, though.
Â 
And Damn, Grandpa Tywin covering Tommen's eyes.Â  It's as if he knows and cares how a kid like Tommen might be effected by seeing such ugliness.Â  That is as surprising as the humanity that Roose shows on tv from time to time.Â  I do love the little empathetic look in Roose's eyes once in awhile.Â  hehehehe

Yes but Tommen is The King now.
Tywinn move is to protect The King. Tywinn knows power and knew where it is now.
1255	nara	2014-04-15	I get the impression that in the show, one year passes for each season.Â  I read somewhere that Joffrey was supposed to be 19.Â  He was like 17 two years ago. Yes, I know he was around 13 in the books.


Â 
I don't think 1 year can pass for each season because that would mean they waited over a year between Blackwater and Marg/Joff wedding, which would be unnecessary.Â  I think they just ignore the aging of the child actors--there's no good way to deal with it--and pray they don't grow as fast as Sansa and Bran have.
1256	Needle's Pointy End	2014-04-15	What do most of them think? He'll die up North?


Â 
I think Stannis will do a lot of the heavy lifting to defeat the Lannister army with help from the north. He may even take a good chunk out of Dany's army.... but he will ultimately die and clear a path for Jon Snow to take the realm.Â

Â 
very nice analysis of the scene. while everyone is focusing on the word infidel, they are really missing out on the really important stuff, i.e. what you've described here.
1260	Needle's Pointy End	2014-04-15	Sansa is missing a gem from her necklace right after lady olena plays with her hair in the scene where olena tells sansa she should come to high garden, also after the pie comes out while everyone is distracted margery puts the wine intront of olena.


Â 
Sorry but this has been rehashed a million times... Olenna is never close to the wine goblet. She is sitting down at her table and the goblet is on the Kings table. There is a knight right in front of Joffery's wine goblet and Olenna would have been caught if she leaned over and plopped something in there... The only way it happened is if Margaery slipped the stone in Joffery's wine when he gave her his wine goblet so he could cut the pie...Â

1262	Needle's Pointy End	2014-04-15	But Sansa knows! She believes to have had a part in murdering Joffrey, she will believe that everyone knows and that makes her emotionally dependent of Baelish. She has to thank him now for giving her shelter and she has to believe that she will never be free of that murder accusation. If now Baelish might make her believe that she has a part in Robin's death then he absolutely has her in his pockets emotionally. And physically because she'd have nowhere to go. As Sansa she poisoned the king, as Alayne she believes herself to have killed the boy. Catch 22, LF's perfect tool.


Â 
I don't think Sansa gives a rats a$$ that she is blamed for the murder.... All she cares is that vengeance was served. This is why it was the perfect crime for Olenna... When she had Sansa wisked away by the fool, it made Sansa look guilty and Sansa has all the motive in the world to kill Joffery, while Olenna has none, considering the wedding bill she just paid for.Â
1263	Needle's Pointy End	2014-04-15	Why doesn't Sansa just pull an Arya and shank Littlefinger a couple times with a sharp blade?


Â 
Sansa is going to Worship Petyr for having Joffery murdered.... lets not fool ourselves.Â
1264	boojam	2014-04-15	Of minor note.First Tyrion screws around with Grand Maester Pycelle.Then Twyin pounces on him for putting on decrepitude airs.Now Cersei is on his case!Time get the hell out of Dodge.

Â 
Because Sansa was a normal girl who thought Joffery was cute when the show started......... Nothing wrong with that.Â
1266	The 10th Penny King	2014-04-15	Of minor note.
First Tyrion screws around with Grand Maester Pycelle.
Then Twyin pounces on him for putting on decrepitude airs.
Now Cersei is on his case!
Time get the hell out of Dodge.


He should fear the Spider...not the Lion.
1267	Onna Lewyys	2014-04-15	What happened to make Cersei hate Pycelle so much anyway? Has she always been like that, or did I miss something?
1268	pantouflas	2014-04-15	As to the second argument, what would be the point in revealing that Tywin was involved now, at this point in the story?
As to the first, Tywin wouldn't even kill Tyrion, who he hated, until he seemed to be a regicide.Â  Even Roose Bolton fears kinslaying.Â  And if he did want to be rid of Joffrey, there were a million better ways to do it, ways that didn't squander valuable assets like Sansa.

Good points
1269	The 10th Penny King	2014-04-15	Seems to me the Iron Islands are problem for D&D, I think because they did not appear in SoS.
First the flapdoodle with the Asha - Yara thing...
And now what the hell is Yara/Asha's story in season 4?
I can't figure it out.


They also need the Greyjoy death reveal to close the loop on the Death of 3 Kings prophecy by MEL last season.Â  Two is not three!
1270	Legion of Doom	2014-04-15	Who the hell was that woman hunting with Ramsay?



I forget her name, but she was one of the two women-Tansy maybe?-who were torturing Theon last season under Ramsay's direction.
1271	Colonel Green	2014-04-15	The woman hunting with Ramsay was named Myranda, one of Ramsay's assistants in cutting off Theon's wienie last year.Â  The other girl was a new character, but was probably originally meant to be the other accomplice (whose actress got pregnant and thus couldn't return).
1272	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-04-15	What happened to make Cersei hate Pycelle so much anyway? Has she always been like that, or did I miss something?


Â 
I think that encounter was as much about the residual frustration from her conversation with Brienne than anything Pycelle specifically did. Â That being said, he's a doddering fool whom she's never tolerated him more than she had to (e.g. the contrast between Ros letting him go on about "the thing you need to understand about kings" and Cersei cutting him off with "I know what 10 drops will bring!") and now that Qyburn is in KL she seems apt to tolerate Pycelle even less than before.

This, and also because it's the first episode actuallyÂ featuring Book Cersei we've had since "Blackwater"

Â 
I imagine being in council meetings and having to deal with him in general would make anyone despise him relatively quickly.
1276	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-04-15	Sansa has been through a lot too so I hate when people compare her with Arya. I love Arya and I didn't really liked Sansa in the beggining but she grew a lot and I admire her strenght.


Â 
I would argue Arya has had it worse than Sansa. I feel like book Sansa is still in denial where as it appears show Sansa is wising up a lot quicker.Â 

Â 
Â 
Â 


Because she is Sansa and not Arya?
I'd certainly like Sansa to become more active but there are different ways of being active and I guess this would not be her approach.
Apart from that putting a character in that kind of ambiguous situation, letting said character simmer for a while and flirt with going over to the dark side simply makes a good story.
I am not really sure if Baelish wants to kill Robin right now but I think it may happen by accident and Baelish may make use of it, morally handcuffing Sansa, or making Sansa his tool may at some point be more important than Little Lord Arryn alive.
And indeed, so far Sasa has little reason to distrust LF, she simply does not know what he did to her family. By now he is her, albeit somewhat sinister, benefactor, the man who saved her not only from a murder accusation but also from her mean aunt.
Coming back to the Arya comparison: Sansa could make use of her abilities and spy on Baelish, question people, read his letters....... whatever clever investigation could be done - if Martin wants her to become clever so soon.


Â 
Ya, I was being a little bit over the top, but as you said I would like her to become a little bit more active in her own life. She definitely can learn a lot from one of the best players in the game, but eventually I'd like to see her take some control, and if in that decision she eventually kills Littlefinger, how sweet! Again as you said, hopefully Martin has her take a little more initiative and she uses her abilities in the next books.Â

This is absolutely not the case. After Joffrey drinks the wine that Tyrion pours him, the pie comes and Joffrey gives his goblet to Margery so he can grab his sword and cut the pigeon pie. Margery puts the goblet on the table in front of Queen of Thorns. That's where the goblet is when Joffrey cuts the pie. The next time he drinks from the goblet he dies.Â

I re-watched and it appears you're right about the goblet placement! The only thing I can think of now is after Olenna tinkers with Sansa's necklace you hear that drop as she is walking across the King's table. This would be an opportune time to slip the poison. If that's not the case I would think someone else must be involved. Â

I was thinking that too! But the "plink" seems to be when she's in front of Marg, and Joff dumps his wine out on Tyrion's head afterwards. It's possible it's slower moving poison (a deviation from the book), but I think it's likelier the poison goes in the cup around the time of the cake cutting. So Marg could have just done it with some good slight-of-hand, or maybe Olenna does it when the camera isn't focused on her (when he slashes the sword).
Â 
It's also possible we're completely overanalyzing...maybe there's a different shot or angle that didn't make the final edits. But yeah, just thought I'd add that screenshot to muddy the watersÂ

EDIT:
Â 
You can see Marg's hands with the goblet (as she's placing it down) are blocked by Joff for a few frames here:Â http://i.imgur.com/XxwPm9B.png?1

Very interesting. Well if Marg is the one then I'm thinking we'll find out when she talks with her grandmother next episode. Or maybe they'll just talk about it in general terms and make us crazy.Â

Is it winter in Kings Landing as of Dance with Dragons?  I must have forgotten that... I know it's snowing furiously in the North but I guess I missed that it had come to KL.

I think they are just trying to set her up as ultra-mean bitch for the show.Â  They did stuff early in series (imaginary black-haired child who died, etc.)Â to make her more sympathetic and now they have to compensate for that.Â  As far as I can tell, the only thing that Pycelle ever did to her was try to keep Jaime out of the delivery room when she was giving birth to Joffrey.Â  He's the one who told her about Myrcella going to Dorne, so she should be grateful to him.
Â 
Of course, she could just think he's a dirty old man who enjoyed examining young women (including herself) far too much.
1285	Needle's Pointy End	2014-04-15	Â 
This is absolutely not the case. After Joffrey drinks the wine that Tyrion pours him, the pie comes and Joffrey gives his goblet to Margery so he can grab his sword and cut the pigeon pie. Margery puts the goblet on the table in front of Queen of Thorns. That's where the goblet is when Joffrey cuts the pie. The next time he drinks from the goblet he dies.Â

That's plausible. Also Show!Pycelle is a super creeper, so it could be that.
1288	jet199	2014-04-15	Having just watched the episode on a slightly bigger screen I'm certain that Marg puts the cup on the edge of her and Joff's table and it only looks like it is in front of Olenna because of the camera angle. If Olenna was the one to put the poison in she would of had to get up and walked over to the table. I am starting to believe, again, that we may get a second reveal about this murder on top of the LF/QOT plot.
1289	TheRatCook	2014-04-15	Â 
I was thinking that too! But the "plink" seems to be when she's in front of Marg, and Joff dumps his wine out on Tyrion's head afterwards. It's possible it's slower moving poison (a deviation from the book), but I think it's likelier the poison goes in the cup around the time of the cake cutting. So Marg could have just done it with some good slight-of-hand, or maybe Olenna does it when the camera isn't focused on her (when he slashes the sword).
Â 
It's also possible we're completely overanalyzing...maybe there's a different shot or angle that didn't make the final edits. But yeah, just thought I'd add that screenshot to muddy the watersÂ  
Â 
EDIT:
Â 
You can see Marg's hands with the goblet (as she's placing it down) are blocked by Joff for a few frames here:Â http://i.imgur.com/XxwPm9B.png?1
Â 
And then Marg is the one pointing Tyrion towards the cup after the cake cutting, here:Â http://i.imgur.com/uKhSTQs.png?1


Interesting screen shots. Yeah, I tried to get a closer look when I re-watched the episode. Olenna takes the gem from the necklace almost 20 minutes before he actually dies. No wonder the unsullied have no idea what is going on....my husband thinks they poisoned the pie. I know what happens and still I don't see anything definitive that points to them poisoning the wine. It must happen off camera.

1290	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-15	Because Sansa was a normal girl who thought Joffery was cute when the show started......... Nothing wrong with that.Not only Sansa. Everybody thought the King was ok.Then, he proved them all wrong in the same episode.

Â 
That's my thought too. But interesting note on this subject...after Olenna "plinks" it in front of Margery, the next shot is Margery leaning her elbow on the table looking "bored" at the singers (she's too calculating to ever do that without reason), and then when she tells Joff to "make the announcement," one of her hands is below the table. My guess is that's when she swept the gem out of sight.
Â 
Unless the QoT and Marg decide to give us a play-by-play recap next episode, we may never know, but the framing is fascinating and I now can't get through that scene without watching Tyrell hands.

But how the hell did Olenna give the poison to Marg in the first place? That "plink" sound is would be from Joffrey's chalice. And how would Joffrey not see it? The drop off from Olenna to Marg I mean.Â
1298	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-04-15	The more I think it about it the more it seems Margery had to at least know.

Â 
If Margaery didn't know that would just be.. stupid. They've both been planning this for a while, and like you said, Olenna would never risk poisoning the wine without Margaery knowing. I think she's just pissed that it's taking so long for her to get her crown.
1300	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-04-15	It's never confirmed in the books though is it? When I read it I didn't really consider if she knew or not because I wasn't reanalyzing what I had just read for enjoyment (until I found Westeros), but I believe we just have confirmations about QOT and Littlefinger.
1301	Obebb	2014-04-15	About if Margaery knew or not, In the preview for 4x03 she says "but I would have been the Queen!" which seems to imply that she has no idea of Olenna's plotting. But maybe that's just weird out of contextÂ

1. joffers died like a bitch )))))
2. i feel so bad for theon by now. and yes. theon. i refuse to call him that other name. the shaving scene was aweful to watch. and "yes master" so sad. im curious to see what my show watcher only friends say about him.
3. whats up with shae? and whats up with bronn? is he turning on tyrion? if so, i dont like it. its one thing to not want to die for him, but openly betraying him would be much worse.


Â 
Bronn always describes himself as a "sell-sword." It's obvious that a mercenary will sell his "loyalty" to the highest bidder. Tywin Lannister is the richest manin the Seven Kingdoms. Surely it was only a matter of time before Bronn sold out Tyrion to Tywin?
Â 
The only question for me is how soon will we learn Shae's fate (our really, how soon in the season will Tyrion learn Shae's fate and thus learn how Bronn has deserted him.)
1303	MoA«t	2014-04-15	My bad, I rewatched it and just noticed the tail. The screech is mixed into the crow caws so I got confused. I guess it's D&D being "We SWEAR she'll eventually get to Westeros!!!"Â 
Â 
To be honest, I think it's both raven and dragon. Go back and do a frame-by-frame... 
Keep in mind that we're looking at Bran's vision. There's a frame near the beginning of the flight over KL that shows the shadow of the wings that you can see space between feathers, then it changes to solid with the dragon tail. To me it felt like it was from Bran's POV, as if he was flying over KL as the three-eyed raven, then as a dragon.

Â 
I agree. I like the ambiguity of the Tyrells - they're fun to decipher; but it would seem more plausible for Margaery to have been clued in. Seems too risky, from a practical perspective, for her not to know. If she doesn't, there had better be some genius plan we're made privy to.
1305	BlueDragon	2014-04-16	I wondered about that too


Â 
Except that it looked absolutely NOTHING like Sansa's necklace. Â I am sure we will know when it is important for everyone to know, but what is obvious is that Tyrion did not do it as he could not have controlled. Â Tyrion is wrong to think he was set up, in my opinion. Â At least in the sense that Lady Olena could not possibly know that Joffrey was going to put Tyrion at the center of that scene.
Â 
Even more importantly, Olena could not have know at what point the chance would come for her to drop that jewel into the right cup.
Â 
Neither does Tywin like the entertainment in the least a some have suggested. Â Anything which make his family look ridiculous would have never won his approval.
Â 
Joffrey's excess of sadism and impatience seems to be the result of performance anxiety.

Apparently?)We get some sketchy ideas of what the laws of succession are in Westeros , but George gives no details.I am not even sure in this Earth world we live in that consummation is a rule for succession.

I hope the show brings out Tywin's hypocrisy clearly.

And as far as I've gathered from the books and the show, consummation is very critical.[\quote]I don't know what Geroge's rules are for his world.That a male has to be regent was true I believe in France too, Catherine de' Medici, when her husband Francis I got killed , stupidly in a joust!, became 'Queen Mother' of her son Francis II, tho she was essentially Queen Regent.When Francis II died, she did become Queen Regent to her 10 year old son Charles IX , then was , for some while, a very powerful Queen Regent (essentially the only French queen).At any rate, Marg confirms in the promo that Joff's death inhibits her being queen, sooooo...I don't know if that's in the book.But I guess Westeros is more like France , no female rulers, GRRM seems to imply that.No Catherine the Great who became empresses and the hell with laws of succession!The laws must have been kind of weird in Russia at that time.
1316	TheonsPhantomCock	2014-04-16	That was pretty cool, actually, especially the way the dwarf actors were attired like the kings. Oh, and Sansa's death glare was a thing of beauty.


Did no-one else notice the little jokes (not the dwarves themselves, I mean), but the little things like the Joffrey dwarf having a lion's head with antlers, the Stannis dwarf getting shot and then exploding with green wildfire (he's also "riding" Melisandre), the reference to the Drowning God in the Balon Greyjoy dwarf screaming "I'm drowning" and best of all, the Renly dwarf who gets hit on his bare a**e by Stannis.(wearing a red heart on his armour) who is saying to Renly "Are you liking it?" and Renly is riding what can only be Loras (blonde curly hair)!!!
Â 
Fascinating seeing everyone's reactions too. Oberyn quietly, unsmiling, just observing, Pycelle clapping, Varys - unamused with his eyes shut, Sansa staring into space, Tommen laughing and then seeing Tyrion and immediately stopping, Tyrion and Cersei enjoying it, the Tyrells completely unamused, Loras storming off, Joffrey giggling like a child..... it was brilliant!

Â 
Â no, we all don't know it's not Tyrion...some people do, some don't.Â  People watching the show who have never read the books may not have any clue there could be someone other than Tyrion - especially since (as things stand right now) there were no gems mising from Sansa's necklace.


There is a gem missing. Watch QOT's right hand. She touches Sansa's braids and then the necklace. In the next shot, it looks like a stone is missing on Sansa's left side.
Â 
Then the QOT makes a funny movement with her right arm (you can see her elbow go back) as she passes Joffrey's table and you can actually hear a little "clink" as something gets dropped into a cup.
1319	boojam	2014-04-16	I can't find my damn post so I will put this up again.Hollywood Reporter:It's a mystery who killed Joffrey. If they look closer at this scene, will viewers be able to figure out who's responsible for the poisoning?Alex Graves:" I tried to shoot it and then edit in such a way that so that if they reveal later in the season who did it, it makes sense. If you watch what's going on, where the killer is and when, you'll go, "Oh, it's happening and progressing visually." It's not like you see it happen, because of the way he dies, but you will notice the movements and the adjustments."This is interesting since GRRM wrote the scene and Alex Graves directed it, I think I read that Graves and Martin talked about the sequence (over the phone , I guess).Does this imply that George gave us more evidence about the mystery than is in the book?

1320	KeeperOfOaths	2014-04-16	I don't believe the love she has for Jaime in the books is the same love she has for Renly; with Jaime it is almost like a sibling thing, like a brother. They've been through a lot together; it is, for lack of a better comparison, a love between men who fight together, like what Robert and Ned had-brothers bound by war and hardship. The love she has for Jaime isn't the same as what she felt for Renly. I mean if that's your point I guess I see that slightly but still her honor to Cat is the main reason she heads out and she feels like she owes Jaime as well. That wasn't what Cersei meant tonight when she asked her, and her response didn't indicate that either, so it's just likely, knowing how the show operates, that they will try to make that the main motivation.Â 


Â 
OMG, really??? It is the complete other way around.
Â 
What Brienne feels for Renly is just a young girlÂ´s crush. A crush that does not have a strong fundament. He treated her with kindness, he valued her as a fighter and he was not so prejudiced so that he wonÂ´t give her an opportunity to fight just because she was a woman. But he didnÂ´t care about her, and there was no actual connection there. Brienne fell in love with a fantasy, really. Just because she is also a woman not only a warrior, and she does have feelings and nobody has treated her with kindness and respect.
Â 
What Brienne feels for Jaime is totally different. It is real love. Born out of respect, and admiration, and a deep understanding. Forged out of extreme experiences and a very strong connection. Jaime is not just a man who treats her with kindness (at the end of their relationship) and appreciates her as a fighter. He is a man who rescued her, twice, who defended her, who actually proved that he does care for her and for her well-being, who entrusted her with his honour, showing that he values her not only as a fighter but also as a woman of honour. With whom she shares values, even if she is still innocent while he has become a cynic due to his life experiences; when he was young he dreamed after allÂ of great deeds of courage,Â of being a knight in shining armour with heroic adventures. And who she actually knows, with good parts and bad parts, she trusts and she likes. 
Â 
So, you may ignore what it is actually happening in the books (she remarking how good he looks in the Oathkeeper scene, she constantly thinking of Jaime, she dreaming of Renly-the man you say she loved so deeply- and then Renly turning into Jaime over and over again, she thinking if Jaime would comfort her is she gave up her quest and return to him without Sansa and actually thinking that this is what men â<U+0080><U+0093>Jaime- may want; a dame in distress to contort, she saying his name over and over again when she is injured etc.), but from this to actually turn it the other way around and say that Brienne cares about Jaime just like a sister â<U+0080><U+0093>other than Cercei J - would care for her brother while her feelings for Renly were Looove, it is a huge difference. And not at all backed up by the books. 
Â 
On the contrary. The books point to the exact opposite. So I am very happy that the show goes into this direction, as well.
1321	jet199	2014-04-16	That's were Marg places it, yet when Tyrion picks it up , from the camera angle it seems closer to Olenna than where it was put down.
That might be a continuity error.
Or maybe in the pigeon hooha it got moved.
I notice oddly that before Sansa hands the cup to Tyrion her left hand passes over the top of the cup.
Then Marg handles the cup and we really can't see where her hands are all the time.
(Now I don't think Sansa dropped the crystal in the cup, but it's odd.)
Just saying.


Â 
It's just the camera angle which makes it look like the cup if in front of Olenna. The camera is taking a shot on a diagonal from in going from the cup, on the corner of Joff's table, across to the other table where Olenna is sitting. The perspective in the shot also gives it away. The cup is very big in the foreground with Olenna small in the background, this shows she is a few yards away. If the cup had been in front of her on her table it would have appeared smaller on screen. Maybe someone who is good with that sort of thing can draw a diagram of the camera's line of sight.
Â 
This isn't a continuity error, they have purposely chosen these camera angles to make it look like the cup next to Olenna when it wasn't. This trick worked really well and they also used distraction to draw away people attention when Marg puts the cup down so people miss where she has put it. They have put a lot of work into making it seem like the the cup was with Olenna on a casual viewing but nowhere near her on closer inspection. They want there to be a double meaning.
I think this is because we are still going to get the QOT did it reveal from LF so they need people to think she had the opportunity but there will be a second reveal, maybe in the next book, that the poisoner was someone else. LF could not really know who actually put the poison in the cup as he was not there and there has always been scepticism about Olenna putting the poison in the cup as she is too short to reach it and others have more opportunity.
Â 
So our suspects in order of probability are Marg, Sansa or Tyrion (or the poison was in the pie but I wont complicate things with that theory).
Â 
Marg has the best access to the cup. If it is Marg the it is not a good plan because if Tyrion had not reacted to Joff then Marg would have been the only one with access to the cup and you know that Cersei wants rid of Marg as much as Tyrion. Unless everyone had bought the choking lie then Marg would've been a dead woman. There is also a big risk that Joff could have asked Marg to take a slip after she had put the poision in but it also works the other way in that once she puts the poison in the cup she knows to stop drinking and doesn't need a secret signal from anyone. The Tyrells bleating about it being terrible because Marg was drinking from the same cup could be to cover the fact she did it.
If it is Marg then it could be revealed in the next book, in or around her trial. I imagine Cersei could be gloating about Marg's honour being lost and Marg throwing back at her "Oh, I forgot to mention, I killed your son. I win".
Â 
Sansa has motive and opportunity however I think I saw Tyrion looking into the cup after Sansa gives it to him. This would mean if Sansa did it then Tyrion knows and let it happen. This would/might be a change from the books but not too big a change because Tyrion certainly suspects Sansa and his defence is partly hampered by the fact that he thinks she had good reasons for wanting Joffrey dead and so wont blame her.
Olenna could have put the jewel into Sansa's hand after taking it from her necklace. There are a few frames where Sansa and Olenna are talking but their hands are out of view. Olenna's words about coming to Highgarden could be hints that Sansa has a chance to leave Tyrion and the Tyrells will help her. Sansa could work out the jewel is poison on her own. However this theory works better if the original target for the poison was Tyrion whose death would free Sansa to marry again (also he is known for his love of wine and sitting right next to Sansa) but Sansa took the opportunity to kill Joffrey instead.
This theory is crackpot as it relies on Sansa's dodgy memory but if we get her talking about the un-kiss on the show then it is a possibility that her memory problems will have a real purpose in the plot. Sansa's POV chapter after the PW is weird, she laughs when she is told she has a good heart, she knows the gem was used in the murder, but not how, when it really shouldn't even occur to her, she outright accuses Dontos of murder. Why doesn't she just assume the amethyst was loose and fell out? It could be this chapter is weird because Sansa is re-writing her memories as the chapter progresses.
Â 
Tyrion has motive and it is also possible that Olenna gave him the jewel when the hands were hidden. Tyrion picks up the cup like he knows something is wrong with it and Joffrey points to him. The problem is that books Tyrion's POV makes not mention of poisoning Joff (except maybe once later) or taking the poison from Olenna. However Tyrion often plots and schemes silently in his POVs. In ADWD he finds out young Griff's ID silently, we have him "educating" Aegon, which we think is him being helpful, only to get a "he took the bait" thought from Tyrion after we find out Aegon has followed his advice. Then we get his escape from slavery and, although it is clear what is happening, he never once thinks about his plan or that they are trying to escape, he just does it. So there is a very slight chance that Tyrion could have poisoned Joff.
One more count against Tyrion is that he and LF are the only two characters to have actually "confessed" to killing Joffery in the books.
1322	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-16	For those who haven't seen it, a nice little reaction from Aimee Richardson (Myrcella):

https://vine.co/v/MJp2KxmPei1
1323	jet199	2014-04-16	agreed
but the breakup scene with tyrion and shae would go a long way to justify shaes behavior later. like they say "hell hath no fury etc"Â 
why did he have to breakup with her. just put a bag over her head and toss her in a ship to pentos. DONE.Â 
lord tywin is not what his mask shows. he is quite capable of passionate acts. Â but the order of elia's murder is not so much an act of passion but a rational (and horrible) act.Â 


It seemed to me that Varys was overly interested in getting Shae to Pentos. Does anyone think that he was planning on sending her to Illyrio so that they would have a hold over Tyrion? She might have become their hostage if she had accepted Varys' offer or got on the boat in the current episode. Still better than what did happen to her I suppose.

I gotÂ  the impression from the books that Varys's relationship with Shae was unusual.Â  She was the only one who recognized him when he was in one of his disguises and he showed her the secret passage out of his room.Â  Perhaps he just likes her and wants her to be safe?Â Â Also, he acknowledges Tyrion saved KL and saving Shae may be related to that.

1326	Colonel Green	2014-04-16	she laughs when she is told she has a good heart,


Because Lady Tanda assumes she's crying for Joffrey (and, by extension, that she loves Joffrey and wants to marry him).
Â 

she knows the gem was used in the murder, but not how, when it really shouldn't even occur to her, she outright accuses Dontos of murder.

Dontos gave her the hairnet and told her it was "magic" and would do a bunch of other stuff, and then there's a stone missing just after Joffrey mysteriously dies of what anybody could guess was poison.Â  Rather obvious, really.
Â 
The "Sansa did it" theory is extraordinarily convoluted in the books, but in the show it's outright impossible given that she did not know anything about the hairnet at all.

Â 
Good points, though Sansa's "dodgy memory" is about events months after they occur, not while it's happening, so I'd assume her innocence. In the books it is fairly likely to be Willas or his wife that did the physical poisoning (Book!Olenna is too short to slip something into the chalice without it being noticeable), but in the show, if it's not Olenna who actually did it, it has to be Marg. Obviously it was Olenna's plan, but I'm really confused by Margery's line in the 4x03 promo, so we'll probably have to wait until then to get some closure.
Â 
Â 


I wonder in the show if we even ever see Aimee Richardson again?
May drop that story line altogether.

Â 
I really hope we'll see her. It'd be funny if her vine reaction was actually meant to be foreshadow the Queenmaker plot. But given how much Arya and Bran are aging, I don't see any reason to exclude Myrcella because of appearance. And I rather like Aimee in the role.
Â 
I'm assuming a lot of Dorne may be on the chopping block for next season, but what happens to Myrcella seems fairly important.

Fast forward the vengance trailer to 1:06 and pay close attention.Â http://www.youtube.c...h?v=ARYEK31yaKI

It seems like this year we're going to get two finales. Episode 9 will involve the huge battle at the wall, and episode 10 will have Tyrion's escape, betrayal, vengance and most likely Littlefinger's reveal. After watching these last two episodes I'm still inclined to think this season will be better than season 1.Â

That event is so monumental and contraversial that it would be beyond stupid to change it. I feel like people are a bit misled about D&D. They're not petty fanboys trying to make some characters better than others to satisfy some silly agenda (Like make Stannis look like the devil or make Tyrion look like an angel). You can disagree with a lot of their choices as I do, but there has never really been any question whether Tyrion will kill Shae. You know what's better for ratings and generating a buzz than having a loveable, witty dwarf? Having a lovable, witty dwarf that just strangled his lover and killed his father.Â

Â 
Oh I agree, I think overall D&D have done a great job adapting the story to film. I rarely get up in arms about the changes they make. I think the only time I've been extremely disappointed by them was when they butchered the House of the Undying in the S2 finale. For me it wasn't about not including the prophecies, but the fact that they had so much startling imagery to work with that would have looked beautiful onscreen and none of it was used. Back to the point, I have faith in D&D, but sometimes the worrywarts on here can be contagious!Â

Â 
Honestly, if they let the audience in on why she betrayed Tyrion I think it will be more likely that she did it out of spite or because she was forced to. The latter would make the murder more controversial.Â

I still think this is a bit of a stretch, because Margeary had to know exactly what was going to happen so as to not put her own life at risk. Honestly, I think that promo for the next episode is a little misleading. I bet the QOT and Margeary will just talk about Joffrey's death in general terms in order to keep the mystery alive until Littlefinger talks to Sansa. Â

and there is a prob too
we see mace tyrell presenting the king with that big chalice , but he doesn't use it in the ceremony. One of the key points that mace tyrell would raise in the following scene is " my daughter drank from the same cup". does this mean that tyrells are off the hook for poisoning?Â

I would prefer the Sansa thing just because it would give her some sort of "backbone" again. Crying Shae of last episodes made her look so desperatly dependend, which is very different from the Shae I have in mind, when I think about the books but also early ShowShae.

This incenses Cersei because Margary is getting a second bite at her sons and this one is the only one left, one she could have easily influenced and directed, unlike Joffrey. Â

I'm getting to the point where, whatever they do with ShowShae, the less she is seen, the better.Â  Hopefully that means, she'll be held as a surprise, surprise at the trial.Â  Cut to...........lying in a bed, a few lines of dialogue, and then I suspect....someone with the last name Lannister will kill her.
Â 
All in all, whatever has become of Shae in and after episode 2, I have my fingers crossed that she shan't be needed until the trial.Â  It'll be nice to see some Peter Dinklage scenes without her, for a damn change.Â  I've noticed that whoever Tyrion does scenes with in an episode, it seems that they must counter it with a scene of him and Shae, the yawningly great love ofÂ his life.Â  I'm not one who has totally hated ShowShae, either, but her scenes really are starting to grow stale.Â  I'm looking forward to some Shae-free tv.Â  ~fingers crossed~

I think this is it. From all the previous scenes with Olenna and Margaery, we've seen that Olenna is extremely wilfull, quick to act or talk, and Margaery is always trying to reign it in and is more careful/courteous. It's the same here, I think, where Olenna is all like ok this kid sucks let's kill him and Marg thinks...Isn't that a bit drastic and risky? It's the Tyrell Spectrum, the oaf without a clue Mace, the level-headed, pragmatic Marg, and the too-clever and dangerous Olenna.Â

Â If Tywin had been pulling the strings this whole time you'd have to think he would have done something useful with the situation by now.


Â 
I used to think, bookwise, that it might have mattered that Bronn is the one who found Shae and the how and the when and where, but with both her and Tywin dead, now I'm not so sure.Â  Yes, I suppose technically it could still come up if Bronn or someone else in the know explains things to Tyrion on a return to Westeros, but I do doubt it, so far.Â 
Â 
As far as the show and Bronn and Shae and this idea of betrayal, I'm not so sure that I think Bronn has as of now, or will, turn on Tyrion.Â  I also never considered it a betrayal in the books.Â  It was totally unreasonable for Tyrion, or anyone for that matter, to expect Bronn to die for Tyrion in a fight with The Mountain.Â  It's not the same situation as the one in the Vale, and Bronn was right, he shouldn't have to DIE for Tyrion,Â that's a bit a much.Â  Now, in the books, yes Bronn took the marriage deal from Cersei, but he took the deal for the bride and whatever else for something that he'd already decided, not to fight the Mountain for Tyrion.Â  It was too iffy of a gamble for him, and I don't blame him, and book Tyrion didn't either.Â  If Cersei was dumb enough to give him something, that's her own damn fault, although.....she was also dumb enough to try and take it away from Bronn again.Â  Now, I'm not sure the Lollys situation will be played out in the show (it could, in some respect, eventually), but still, as of now, I don't think Bronn has betrayed Tyrion in the show, and I'm thinking that if anything, a somewhat working relationship with Jaime will keep Bronn around without betraying Tyrion on the show, too.Â  I suppose TV audiences are used to Bronn getting Tyrion out of trouble, but I'm not one who is sold on the idea of Bronn betraying him, even in the show.Â  I suspect Bronn and the Crownlands, and his stepson Tyrion.......might play a part in later novels.Â

Well, Margaery has proven herself to be quite a good actress already. And I'm thinking her attitude toward the whole thing, including in that scene in the promo, is probably like, "All right, fine, Grandma, but this better work."

1361	Floop	2014-04-16	I just love thinking back on that wonderful scene in which Olenna and Margaery sit down with Sansa to find out the truth about Joffrey. I like to think that Olenna decided his fate right then and there.

1362	Natalie Underfoot	2014-04-16	I'm having such a hard time figuring out what their angle is with ShowShae. Â In the book, I read her as aware of her place, maybe willing to push the envelope a bit but overall just a person who knew her place and cared about Tyrion as she would a rich guy who obviously takes care of her. Â I liked the ending of the book because I felt it was a dark turn for Tyrion as there was ambiguity as to why she may have betrayed him. Just knowing in my head that she might have been forced by Tywin made the death darker for me and it that the moment was just rage with Tyrion.
Â 
I feel like with ShowShae everyone's going to immediately assume she betrayed him due to anger which takes some of that ambiguity away and makes the killing more about tortured Tyrion rather than wrathful, vengeful Tyrion. I don't know how much of that is the writing, how much of that is the characters and how much of that is the fact that Dinklage has such charisma and vulnerability that you instinctively want to believe the best. I know that people who just watch the show hate Shae for the same reason they dislike Sansa. They view her as being stupid and not appreciating her situation.Â 
Â 
I believe Marg had to be in on it but maybe is having some doubts now that she realizes that Cersei is Queen Regent again, or she's just doing with QofT told her in the first episode. Being careful of what you say, even around me.
Â 
I believe that Varys may want to help Shae if for no reason other than they are both foreigners. I also think that Varys is invested in keeping the Lannisters in power for as long as possible as he views them as the best people to have as the reigning king/queen with Danys comes to town. Â The Tyrell's would probably be adored and that would mean no one would be as willing to jump into a war with a supposed lost prince. Let the Lannisters destroy the country with their madness and vengeance and people will flock to Aegon's side when he comes.

I've seen this a number of times and really don't get it. Â You think that Olenna is carelessly confessing their shared crime out in the open while Margaery plays coy?

Olenna says 'you are better off' -- as in anything but being married to that psychopath is my choice for you.
Â 
Marg is decrying her almost queen status.
Â 
Neither of them are necessarily giving away anything in that conversation so far no matter where they are speaking.

Â 
I'm just going with what I was given and since that's not a scene that goes in the book I don't feel like there's anything wrong with wondering what it is, sure it could be edited out of context, but even if it is, obviously they want to imply that that's the conversation that happened.
Â 
. I never said Olenna confessed her crime, at most she said it's not the worst thing that Joff died. I'm addressing the fact that Marg seems to be upset that it went down and that doesn't sit with my belief that she knew so I'm giving two possible explanations why she might be reacting like that.

Â 
She MUST act upset. Â And even if she knew, the gruesome nature of the poisoning would surely have been hard for her to watch. Â She isn't a psychopath although she is neither a virgin nor innocent.
Â 
Better for her to gasp with horror and turn away than the alternatives. Â She couldn't have pulled off grief that the love of her life was dying in this way.
Â 
We are all speculating, but some speculations seem reasonable and logical while others seem off base.
Â 
Making Marg seem truly disappointed keeps the unsullied from wondering if she was responsible.
Â 
I don't think Marg would kill without some misgivings even if she isn't as pure and innocent as Sansa was at the beginning of the story.
Â 
By the way, Â I loved the dead sparrow necklace line. Â If she wasn't frightened about what might happen with Joffrey, she isn't as smart as she appears. Â I think she genuinely liked Renly although I have no illusions that she had affection for him. Â 
Â 
Like Cersei, Marg might be counting on her brother to save her from her husband. Â That is not a wise assumption. Â
1367	Lord of Winterhell	2014-04-16	Sorry if this has been discussed somewhere, but there are two things I don't get:
Â 
1. What's the point of Sansa's necklace (hairnet in the books)? After reading books I wasn't sure, but after reading some threads here I guess some part of hairnet (one jewel in the show) was used to poison Joffrey. Whoever poisoned him, why would he do it in such a complicated manner? To make it work, killer would need to a) make sure that Sansa wears necklace (don't remember who she got hairnet from in the books),  get close to Sansa and take some part from it without her noticing it before c) it was the right time to put it in Joffeys wine.
Â 
Why wouldn't the killer simply take some poison in whatever he can in his own cloths? Doesn't make any sense to me. I guess I am just missing something, so somebody smart please explain.
Â 
2. I guess that Olenna is the main suspect, but even after slow rewatch I don't see any chance for her to poison that wine. Marg gets the cup from Joff when he goes to kill some doves, then puts in on central table (where only royal couple sits), and later Tyrion takes it back. Olenna sits at least 3-4 meters from the cup, and only stands for couple of seconds to cheer Joffrey after he cuts the pie. There's like 0% chance she could walk to the next table and spill something in Joffreys cup unnoticed.

Â 
Olenna is too far from cup. Â You are right. Â But not 3-4 meters!!! Â She is maybe six feet from cup. Â My theory is that she passes jewel to Marg.
Â 
The assumption is that carrying poison on your person at such an event would be very, very dangerous should you be caught. Â Something would need to be slipped in at the last minute because there are always food/wine tasters around for royalty.
Â 
Dontos gives her the hairnet, but it is given in such a way that she can't refuse to wear it.

Plus there's a strong possibility that the hairnet was intended to point the blame at Sansa after the event, but Littlefinger betrayed the Tyrells by getting Sansa out of there. I assume the books still have more to reveal about what happened at the wedding.
Â 
On the necklace: that was to be honest a little weak in the TV show - in the books, Olenna could be quite sure that Sansa was going to wear the hairnet, but in the show there wasn't much of a reason for Sansa to wear the necklace to that specific event. Of course, if Dontos had said "You must wear it to the wedding! You must wear it to the wedding!", that would have been an obvious giveaway that something was up.
1370	The Taxman	2014-04-16	You really can't fault the show directors for this portion of the books. This was just bad writing in the books from GRRM. Again, even when LF was explaining to Sansa what went down I was still mighty confused. Imagine the unsullied.
1371	MoA«t	2014-04-16	Joffrey's death was done terribly bad. Nothing from Cersei.. It's like she didn't even give a shit! he should have been surrounded by people trying to save him... I hate HBO so much.I guess you not only didn't watch the preview for ep 3, but also forgot this season has more eps to come.... And the fact the last frame of this ep was dead Joffrey, leaving everything that happens next (everyone's reactions and the aftermath) coming up in ep 3.. crazy, I know.
One of the few times Lena Headey's acting didn't cut it.
And when she's stellar in the first scene this coming Sunday, because the reaction you're complaining about hasn't been aired yet because the ep cut off in the middle of the action, so we could relish dead Joffrey, what then?

1372	boojam	2014-04-16	I can't find my damn post so I will put this up again.Hollywood Reporter:It's a mystery who killed Joffrey. If they look closer at this scene, will viewers be able to figure out who's responsible for the poisoning?Alex Graves:" I tried to shoot it and then edit in such a way that so that if they reveal later in the season who did it, it makes sense. If you watch what's going on, where the killer is and when, you'll go, "Oh, it's happening and progressing visually." It's not like you see it happen, because of the way he dies, but you will notice the movements and the adjustments."This is interesting since GRRM wrote the scene and Alex Graves directed it, I think I read that Graves and Martin talked about the sequence (over the phone , I guess).Does this imply that George gave us more evidence about the mystery than is in the book?Just to put it up again.The mystery started way back with the publication of Storm of Swords.Almost flame wars broke out over just the prose description.It is interesting what Alex Graves says the solution is visual clues.So GRRM , who wrote this episode, sets up the same sequence , tho a bit condensed.I past this from Wikipedia:"It is commonly suggested that sleight of hand works because "the hand is quicker than the eye" but this is usually not the case. In addition to manual dexterity, sleight of hand depends on the use of psychology, timing, misdirection, and natural choreography in accomplishing a magical effect. Misdirection is perhaps the most important component of the art of sleight of hand. The magician choreographs his actions so that all spectators are likely to look where he or she wants them to. More importantly, they do not look where the performer does not wish them to look. Two types of misdirection are timing and movement. Timing is simple: by allowing a small amount of time to pass after an action, events are skewed in the viewer's mind. Movement is a little more complicated. A phrase often used is "A larger action covers a smaller action.""This may be the solution, no I have not figured it , but apparently what George had on the page was elaborated on the screen.Some, I am sure have thought of this, but all the obvious clues may not be the ones that solve the puzzle.
1373	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-04-16	I just love thinking back on that wonderful scene in which Olenna and Margaery sit down with Sansa to find out the truth about Joffrey. I like to think that Olenna decided his fate right then and there.


Couldn't agree more with you. When Sansa is done explaining how horrible Joffrey is I believe Olenna says "What a pity." I always read that as, oh what a pity we'll have to kill him then. Olenna is quite the badass.Â
1374	rmholt	2014-04-16	Â 
Good points, though Sansa's "dodgy memory" is about events months after they occur, not while it's happening, so I'd assume her innocence. In the books it is fairly likely to be Willas or his wife that did the physical poisoning (Book!Olenna is too short to slip something into the chalice without it being noticeable), but in the show, if it's not Olenna who actually did it, it has to be Marg. Obviously it was Olenna's plan, but I'm really confused by Margery's line in the 4x03 promo, so we'll probably have to wait until then to get some closure.
Â 
Â 
Â 
I really hope we'll see her. It'd be funny if her vine reaction was actually meant to be foreshadow the Queenmaker plot. But given how much Arya and Bran are aging, I don't see any reason to exclude Myrcella because of appearance. And I rather like Aimee in the role.
Â 
I'm assuming a lot of Dorne may be on the chopping block for next season, but what happens to Myrcella seems fairly important.

Little known fact: Olenna was a point guard for the Arbor team. The clinks are dinnerware. She had a good crossover but Loras' was better. She had the outside set shot.
For Marg to be queen the Tyrells have count on Tywin not rethinking the alliance. Someone could get a little apprehensive while things are playing out, or TV folk might benefit from an explanation.

Cersei isn't real demonstrative by nature and has this curse on her keeping her kind of edgy. With that dad I bet she stuffs her feelings.

Â 
I dont think the Tyrells had any intention of blaming Sansa or any of the blame falling onto her. They were genuinely looking out for her. With that being said, I do think Olenna would have had a good idea that Tyrion would have been fingered for it given the strained relationship of Cersei Joffery and Tyrion and by association Sansa would have gone down for it as well but in the end shes one girl. I dont know if Littlefinger would have told the Tyrells the entire plan for Sansa as they wanted her for Loras and to get her out of the capital and her falling into Littlefingers hands is arguably just as bad as the Lannisters in some ways.
Â 
I will be interested to see how they play Littlefinger into this whole thing in the coming episodes because there are lots of questions that arent fully answered and I think the show was far less subtle than the books were at pointing out who did it and maybe theyll also reveal a few extra things there to.
1377	rmholt	2014-04-16	Don't know if this is the right sub forum but in the intro, a new Q and an old: the Dragonstone to Dreadfort  flyby goes past the 3 sisters and a vague town seems to be off to the left. With an octopoidy shape. White Harbor? Old castle? Misplaced sisterton w spiders crab? Also the dominant structure in the intro is awesome but could be seen as a sword or spear through a sun. My pot of brown is up to 3 meats but 16 beans. Maybe the dogs will bring in another ground squirrel.

Â 
Tywin really cant rethink the Tyrell alliance.
Â 
The Tyrells have a fairly firm grasp of power at this point. As we hear in this episode the Iron Bank is knocking. The capital is in major debt and the Tyrells are a source of a) soldiers  food c) money and major sources at that. Without the Tyrells the kingdom would be in complete disaray and Tywin knows this, whats worse, so does Olenna.
Â 
I think Cersei would be hesitant in entering the alliance, Margery Tyrell, twice a widow to murdered kings - but Tywin is very intent on marrying someone to her. if Jamie wont then the only other option is Tommen. Which falls straight into their plans.
Â 
I think the Tyrells - more specifically Olenna - is a tactical genius.

I sorta think that the Tyrells wanted to make it look like a genuine choking instead of pointing the finger at Tyrion and Sansa. Tyrion was sort of in the wrong place at the wrong time.
1380	T.C	2014-04-17	Podrick has lost weight and evolved throughout the seasons, could probably even pass off as handsome now.
Â 
Ramsays actor seems to have lost weight too.
1381	MoA«t	2014-04-17	The dragon image isn't meant to be a literal event. It either means a dragon arriving at King's Landing aka Dany (not ON a dragon, but the idea of her, a dragon, arriving at King's Landing.... Or about her reign in King's Landing? Have to point out it appeared to be 'summery'). Or, it could be in relation to The Three Eyed Crow and his heritage.

Why not? Most everything in Bran's vision was a literal event. Why would a dragon flying over KL not be a literal event to come?
Bran is going to warg a dragon. 
And why can't the three heads be Jon, Bran, and Arya since they're all wargs?
1382	MoA«t	2014-04-17	Agree, it's a TOTAL nitpick, but why not purple, and for that matter, why not a hairnet. Â The idea that she's going to realistically have a huge gemstone on her necklace missing and no one notice it....seems fairly unlikely.
Because this is a TV show, and a necklace is easier to shoot, allow someone else to touch and have the missing stone easily kept in frame and seen in the shot without having to shoot the back or top of Sansa's head. 
I thought the color was fine, considering how hard staying true to color is with video. (Green-eyed actors show up as blue-eyed a lot.) 
They're not going to spend post $$$$ on fixing the color for book fans when it's close enough, and there are dragons and Lady S to pay for.
1383	ovis alba	2014-04-17	I sorta think that the Tyrells wanted to make it look like a genuine choking instead of pointing the finger at Tyrion and Sansa. Tyrion was sort of in the wrong place at the wrong time.


Â 
I think that was plan A
But I think when you poison someone, in case someone notices it was poison anyway you should always have a plan B which is: hide the poison on someone else. And I think the Tyrells are too smart for not having plan B.
And I don't really believe in the Tyrells genuine care for Sansa, I think if anything the Tyrells are very pragmatic, they side with whoever seems likely to win, first Renly then the Lannisters. Sansa might have been a nice addition to get hold of the North but after she got married to Tyrion she sort of lost some value despite the fact that the Tyrells are known to sort of care for her and the fact that she clearly has more reason to hate Joffrey so who better to use as a poison delivery? Especially as the Tyrells that like her so much would never set her up.
1384	Talking Hodor	2014-04-17	After rewatching, Olenna Tyrell asking someone to help Joffrey while he was choking totally reminds me of Willie Wonka in the original movie after something bad happened to one of the kids crying out sarcastically, "Help. Police."
1385	Talking Hodor	2014-04-17	Because this is a TV show, and a necklace is easier to shoot, allow someone else to touch and have the missing stone easily kept in frame and seen in the shot without having to shoot the back or top of Sansa's head.

Nobody would have even seen a purple hairnet in Sansa's hair.Â  The necklace was a good visual.Â  It was dang hard enough seeing Olenna play sleight of hand with one of the necklace jewels.Â  Seeing her do that to a hairnet would have been impossible.
1386	Talking Hodor	2014-04-17	Why not? Most everything in Bran's vision was a literal event. Why would a dragon flying over KL not be a literal event to come?
Bran is going to warg a dragon.
And why can't the three heads be Jon, Bran, and Arya since they're all wargs?


Too bad old King Torrhen, the king that knelt, didn't brush up on his warging abilities prior to Aegon the Conqueror's arrival.Â  Balerion would have bucked him like a rodeo clown.
1387	Talking Hodor	2014-04-17	That works for some storylines, like KL, but not others. Because in that case, it took Bran & co. an entire year to walk from Winterfell to the Wall.


The North's huge.Â  They're attempting to evade everybody, and poor Hodor has to wheelbarrow Bran, and most likely most of the supplies, quietly the whole way.Â  It could easily take a year to do that.
1388	Talking Hodor	2014-04-17	Why doesn't Sansa just pull an Arya and shank Littlefinger a couple times with a sharp blade?


She hasn't learned about what he did to her family yet.Â  Once that happens, I predict a shank fest.
1389	Talking Hodor	2014-04-17	Well, yeah, IMHO this is how Joffrey's death scene should've gone down:
Joffrey:Â  *choke,gag* (Points at Tyrion instead of vague "reaching" gesture).
Joffrey:Â  *dies*
Cersei:Â  (shriek) "He's dead!Â  My son is DEAD!" (hysterics)
(Camera pans out forÂ crowd reaction shot)
(END OF EPISODE, roll credits!).
Next episode's opening scene:
Cersei total meltdown:Â  "You did this!! YOU KILLED MY SON!Â  Seize him!"
Why D&D didn't do this is beyond me...


Â 

Cutting out mid-scene would be a bit like coitus interruptus.Â  How are you supposed to just begin again with Cersei practically mid sentence?Â  What benefit would there be to delay Tyrion's arrest to next week?Â  It's still a cliffhanger the way they did it - we don't know what's going to happen to TV-Tyrion, we have no idea where TV-Sansa is heading, and we suspect all the other TV-suspects at the moment, who are all probably wishing they could sneak onto Littlefinger's boat out of KL.
1390	Talking Hodor	2014-04-17	Because she is Sansa and not Arya?
I'd certainly like Sansa to become more active but there are different ways of being active and I guess this would not be her approach.
Apart from that putting a character in that kind of ambiguous situation, letting said character simmer for a while and flirt with going over to the dark side simply makes a good story.
I am not really sure if Baelish wants to kill Robin right now but I think it may happen by accident and Baelish may make use of it, morally handcuffing Sansa, or making Sansa his tool may at some point be more important than Little Lord Arryn alive.
And indeed, so far Sasa has little reason to distrust LF, she simply does not know what he did to her family. By now he is her, albeit somewhat sinister, benefactor, the man who saved her not only from a murder accusation but also from her mean aunt.
Coming back to the Arya comparison: Sansa could make use of her abilities and spy on Baelish, question people, read his letters....... whatever clever investigation could be done - if Martin wants her to become clever so soon.


Sansa has it in her to kill someone.Â  She's still a wolf.Â  She had murderous thoughts about Joffrey all throughout the books, and TV-Sansa contemplated pushing Joffrey off a wall.
1391	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-04-17	I never realised that who killed was a mystery until this thread. 
In the books, LF tells Sansa he plotted with Olenna. 
Anyway. 
Great episode. 
I laughed at te guy in this thread saying that because Joffrey didn't claw his own throat, that HBO are lazy and didn't bother much with the episode. 
The same episode where Joffrey cut open a pie and doves came flying out. But they skimped on the details cos they're lazy lololol
1392	UNoNuthinJonSnow	2014-04-17	Wasn't this episode awesome? I was so shocked when they arrested Tyrion for something he would never do. If he wants to kill somebody he would never poison this person. But who will sit on the throne now?
Â 
Furthermore I'm really interested in Bran's story. Will we see him transforming into an animal at the end of the season? Â (this is not a Spoiler i didn't read the books ^^)

1405	MoA«t	2014-04-17	After Olenna takes the stone, as she is walking pass Joffrey's cup you head a distinct "Cling" sound as if something solid touched a chalice if your volume is high enough. Olenna took the stone and slipped it in the cup. I just don't know how the stone dissolved in the cup. Marg didn't do anything but she definitely knew the plan.Why is everyone so obsessed by this random sound? That sound you hear could be anything BUT Olenna dropping the Strangler into anything.
Why? Because at that point, the dwarf joust hasn't even happened yet, let alone Joffrey pouring wine onto Tyrion's head, then demanding Tyrion be his cupbearer, Joffrey dropping the cup onto the floor and kicking it away from Tyrion, Sansa picking it up and handing the now very empty cup (since Joffrey poured it all on Tyrion), so how in Seven Hells would the poison still be in the cup at that point?
And no, she didn't drop it into a shared wine carafe that everyone at the table was sharing.
Random sound is random.

I think they were assuming it was a poison other than the strangler and therefore Joff drank the poison before the joust, but the side effects didn't occur until later. However, the more I look into it the more it seems that the strangler was used and Margery most likely gave it to him right after he cut the pie.
1407	TeamLemonCakeBraavos	2014-04-17	Side note: If Olenna put the poison in after she took it off of Sansa, wouldn't it have been wasted when he poured the wine on Tyrion's head?Â

Â 
So when the fuck did she pass it to Margaery? She was at another table. No way she got up off her ass and planted it in the drink when Joffrey was slicing the bird cake.Â

Â 
Misdirection during any number of moments. Â Just walking over to Marg and giving her a hug or talking to her would not have been misconstrued. Â Lots of people were moving around at different points between 'events' like dwarf play and pie cutting. Â
1410	MoA«t	2014-04-18	what can Â happen in episode 10 that isso effects heavy? The stuff at The Vale?
My guess is that, along with Lady Stoneheart, baby-eating dragons, Arya & The Hound part ways, Tyrion testing out becoming a serial-killer, and Bran meeting Blood Raven.

1413	Olvyr	2014-04-18	Couldn't agree more with you. When Sansa is done explaining how horrible Joffrey is I believe Olenna says "What a pity." I always read that as, oh what a pity we'll have to kill him then. Olenna is quite the badass.Â

If they look closer at this scene, will viewers be able to figure out who's responsible for the poisoning?Alex Graves:" I tried to shoot it and then edit in such a way that so that if they reveal later in the season who did it, it makes sense. If you watch what's going on, where the killer is and when, you'll go, "Oh, it's happening and progressing visually."  It's not like you see it happen, because of the way he dies, but you will notice the movements and the adjustments."I don't think a mistake was made.

1417	serdontosdared	2014-04-18	Hey guys huge ASOIAF fan
First time post very nice to join you all, I would like you all to closely watch the purple wedding scenes over and over. The only time the joffrey was able to be poisoned was as soon as margaery takes the cup form his hands and puts it on the table. Margaery is looking directly into joffreys eyes and she drops the crystal in (whilst joff has hisÂ  back turned to his family)Â  I'm 99% sure she puts it in the second her hands take the goblet from joff.
I could be wrong though but it's the only time possible for the poison to be dropped in if it is fast acting, there was simply no other time. I've come to this conclusion after rewatching the entire purple wedding scenes and going back and forth, very neatly done and it makes for very interesting viewing and reviewing, D&D and GRRM and the writers are knocking it out of the park, the dialogue is still as awesome as before but things are getting worse which is played out by the characters perfectly well imo.

1418	BlueDragon	2014-04-18	What bugs me about this is that the scene is NOT improved by not being sure how this came down. Â I can't precisely remember my reaction when I read this part, or when I knew what, but I was sure it was one of those amethyst jewels that did the deed. Â There are already a long, long list of mysteries in these books, why add one more when we must know so much in order to even follow the sequence of events? Â I can see Sansa wearing that beautiful hair net and a close up of Oleanna's fingers plucking one off, which is certainly more believable than her removing a huge jewel which has to be solidly affixed in order not to fall off.
Â 
This has been driving me crazy. I have been watching over and over with slow motion, freeze framing the film, on big screen and small computer scene and while there are plenty of visual clues in that Oleanna is in the side or background, there is nothing clear and not a single shot makes anything crystal clear. Â Pieta's shots above are the best. Â 
Â 
Mystery on top of mystery makes for annoyance in the long run. Â 
Â 
My money is on Marg. Â If she had any doubts, Joffrey's performance at the reception was so outrageous that she might have realized she had to take Â her chance toÂ

Marg clearly puts it on her table at the far end, a good 10 feet from Olenna. The shot of Olenna looking at it is sneaky perspective.
Â 
Logically, Marg would have been the one to do it, because she was the only one touching the cup in between the wine being dumped on Tyrion's head and Joff drinking again (other than Tyrion, who we know is innocent). There was also a guard right there. However, I'm thinking there might have been a continuity error, and they'll have Olenna being the one doing it, based purely on the interviews we've seen.
Â 
It doesn't make a huge difference: a Tyrell woman did this. But it is frustrating that after several rewatches there's nothing conclusive.

Not so clearly. Boojam has right. If she puts it on her table, so why the cup disappears? We have three different shots at the kings table after that, and there's no cup. It's gone. We see this. Fourth shot is when Tyrion is taking it, and it's nearly sure, that the cup is returning to the kings table.
Â 
Maybe Margaery decide to move the cup on the Tyrell's table? And when Tyrion goes to take it, somebody (Olenna, guard or some servant) helps him putting down the cup closer to him. We don't see this. If it's true, everything is correct. No directing errors, and Olenna is a poisoner.

I can see her being pissed, but maybe not pissed enough to essentially sentence him to death. unless Â the writers really want to make it out to be a mega bitch move on her part. I could see them going "testify, or die" and she will reluctantly do it.
1431	boojam	2014-04-19	Doesn't matter. Cersei isn't the "Queen" after Robert dies, because women don't inherit in Westeros. It's why the Dornish have their Myrcella plot - because they do allow women to inherit.If it's allowed in Dorne, ok.But that still would not make Myrcella queen in KL if women are not allowed to ascend to the throne.(By the by it seems that way, but I can't remember any where in the books where George explicitly says a woman cannot be an absolute monarch , so many pages maybe he does somewhere.)

No directing errors, and Olenna is a poisoner.Stepping through the 'frames' you never see Marge set the goblet down, that is she sets it on the table but her hand never releases it.Then we have quite a number of beats where either the camera POV is not on the tables or the area where the goblet was set is obscured. That all camera POV mind you.

Sure enough Marg does set in on the end of the table, tho, we dont see her let go of it.

There are indeed some missing camera POVs.
It does look as if it is magically back on the end of the royal couples table when Tyrion picks it up, but don't know if it's forced perspective or not, it does not look like it's in the same place Marg set it down, if she set it down.
This kind of visual narrative is not exactly in the book, but then giving all the visual details on the page can make the writing seem awkward.

Â 
It's strange. The only still where the cup is missing does not show up in the version I am watching. I am talking about the one where Margaery has her hands covering her mouth, right after Joffrey cuts the cake. I see basically the same still, but cut in half, where the cutting point is approximately where the cup should be. Or am I missing something? Regardless, it is hard to believe that QoT had the opportunity to poison the wine when there was a soldier just next to the cup. I bet on Marg.
Â 
EDIT: In the frame immediately after, I can see the cup on top of the table, next to the other glass of wine.

Is it because she is really distressed for losing a second husband? Could it be that she was forced to do it, against her own will?

Maybe, but that coupled with the interview previously posted here where Natalie says that Marg is "genuinely surprised" when Joff starts to show signs of discomfort make me think it was the QoT behind her back.
1438	boojam	2014-04-19	It's strange. The only still where the cup is missing does not show up in the version I am watching. I am talking about the one where Margaery has her hands covering her mouth, right after Joffrey cuts the cake. I see basically the same still, but cut in half, where the cutting point is approximately where the cup should be. Or am I missing something? Regardless, it is hard to believe that QoT had the opportunity to poison the wine when there was a soldier just next to the cup. I bet on Marg.Â EDIT: In the frame immediately after, I can see the cup on top of the table, next to the other glass of wine.Look at the frame just after Jof has cut the pie the pigeons are flying up Marg is clasping her hands , her mouth open apparently exclaiming. The long shot.The cup is just flat not there.As Jof returns to the table and the servants are picking up the pie , no cup! Medium shot.(By the by apparently the "pigeon pie" for the cutting is just to hold pigeons, apparently the real pie is elsewhere, because the serving maids immediately appear with plate of already prepared pie, actually that makes sense.)Anybody ever had Pigeon Pie? Does not sound tasty to me!

I'm probably being too picky, but this has always confused me too. Are there any materials that will dissolve in a room temperature solution, but remain completely crystalline and dry when exposed to human skin and body temperature? When cooking I've dealt with lots of things that dissolve, but they're all kind of messy if you handle them for any length of time. They melt a bit and most certainly leave traces on your skin. Try wearing a cough drop on a necklace and see how well that goes.
Â 
On residue: doesn't book-Tyrion pour out what's left in the cup, in part because he wants to protect Sansa? I can't remember the motive, but I'm fairly sure that his pouring out the dregs - and thereby getting rid of any residue - is one of the pieces of evidence against him.
Â 
Edit: Oh, on pigeon pie: I've eaten pigeon a number of times, and it tastes, unsurprisingly, like rather bony and gamy chicken. I assume a pigeon pie is similar to a chicken pie.

You're right, but as you said before it may be from that POV. The cup could be laying behind Marg. But I don't dismiss the pie hypothesis, though. The cup could very well be a red herring.

Sansa had certainly good reason for it.

"Cressen no longer recalled the name the Asshaii gave the leaf, or the Lysene poisoners the crystal. In the Citadel, it was simply called the strangler. Dissolved in wine, it would make the muscles of a mans throat clench tighter than any fist, shutting off his windpipe. They said a victims face turned as purple as the little crystal seed from which his death was grown, but so too did a man choking on a morsel of food"
IMO I think it was def the Strangler.  This whole thread has been such a great read.  I love reading everyone's thoughts and theories.
					
					
							Edited by Cersei the Great, 19 April 2014 - 10:43 AM.
1445	Ran	2014-04-19	I think Martin's suggestion that he has yet to reveal all things is that: a) at the time of the interview, viewers don't know the involvement of any other third parties, i.e. Littlefinger, and  the specific events leading to Tyrion being blamed and Sansa running away tie into (a), and are (in my estimation) things that Littlefinger worked with the Tyrells up to a point but made sure to manipulate things to get what he wanted (Tyrion blamed, Sansa escaped).I buy the idea that the Tyrells didn't mean to pin it on Tyrion and Sansa, but then I always though so from the time ASoS was published. Indeed, given what we see of the QoT, she has a vehement hatred of Oberyn Martell, so I think in all likelihood she did indeed mean to pin it on Oberyn -- and maybe Littlefinger assured her that he'd help lay evidence to point in that direction.utThese details would need the further books to come out, as so far on can only speculate, and so that fits Martin's remark.But the very specific claim that two unrelated parties of would-be poisoners decided to use the same poison, at the same event, at approximately the same time? It strains credulity.

1446	Mithras	2014-04-19	The most â<U+0080><U+009C>unacceptableâ<U+0080><U+009D> fact in the canon story for me is the idea that Olenna and LF actually sat together and plotted the murder of a king. I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t think Tyrells can trust any person (whether a highborn or a lowborn) in such a dangerous plot except their own family.
Â 
Book LF is seen as an â<U+0080><U+009C>upjumped jackanapesâ<U+0080><U+009D> as Randyll put it. Like most of the other nobility, the Tyrells are also obsessed with noble blood. While Tywin was charging LF to marry Lysa and bring the Vale into the kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s peace, Mace needed to be reminded that LF is fit to the marriage as the Lord of Harrenhal. Even with such a title, they need time to consider LF as a high lord. So, how can they hope to trust such a man?
Â 
Besides, LF plainly tells us how he does his work. While treating with the Tyrells, he praised Joffrey to the skies whereas his servants spread the word of his psychopathic nature. He planted his other ideas the same way, without saying anything but feeding proper information through his agents, so that the Tyrells believe that those are their own ideas.
Â 
With this perspective, there must be a mechanism to make sense of how the Tyrells knew and decided to use Sansaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s poison carrying hairnet.

1449	Ran	2014-04-19	I can't recall anywhere where Olenna Tyrell is obsessed with noble blood. Indeed, quite the opposite:If truth be told, even our claim to Highgarden is a bit dodgy, just as those dreadful Florents are always whining. 'What does it matter?' you ask, and of course it doesn't, except to oafs like my son.She is a very unconventional woman. Littlefinger's an unconventional man. No big surprise that they would work together... and also against one another. Olenna tried to ferret Sansa away to her own ends, Littlefinger stopped it, she needed help murdering Joffrey, he provided it... and got away with Sansa to boot, which it seems likely she didn't anticipate. Because Littlefinger twisted things to his purposes, and not hers.

Â 
I am not the best person to notice these things, but it seems plausible to me that the cup could have been a little more to the right, lying behind Marg in those frames. You see her laying the cup down from a side perspective, lacking any sense of depth. I haven't noticed any frame dismissing this hypothesis. Or maybe it's really a continuity error and we are overthinking it.
Â 
EDIT: I forgot about Tyrion. He clearly goes all the way to the end of the table.

1452	starki	2014-04-19	Surprised with so many theories around...the TV version may be hard on pinning it down on Tyrion or Sansa but have the people forgotten about the little chat Sansa had with Margaery and Grandma Tyrell about Joffrey ?
Â 
Oberyn is another fine addition to the show. And finally the troubadour Tyrion is off the screen with Shae gone (IF she's gone...no way with all this romance setup will they refrain from using her as a star witness against Tyrion).
1453	Honey Badger	2014-04-21	Regarding the poisoning, I don't know Marg and QoT's exact movements, as it seems Marg has the better position to slip the strangler jewel.
Â 
However, when QoT walks over with the poison, you see a far shot and a *PLONK* sound effect, which could mean she just slipped it in the cup.Â  But that sound could have been from another character as it's a far shot and we see blurred people in the foreground.
Â 
So maybe she handed it off to Marg who then poisons the cup and offers it to Joff.Â  I'm not sure.Â  But I think Marg is definitely a part of the plot.Â

The false Tyrion reminds me of the ret-con where Tyrion is suddenly an acrobat in Dance and wanted to runaway to join the circus.Â  I hope they foreshadow that better in the show and introduce it if they're going to use it when Tyrion is on the boat sailing away.Â  Otherwise it's going to be awkward to shove in the show "btw I love the circus."Â  Hey there's a dwarf girl and a pig for jousting!

Apologies if anyone has mentioned this already but on second watch we noticed there is a great little moment just after Marge has fed Joffrey the pie where she conciously but very subtley wipes her hand to remove any poison, er, crumbs. I loved these little red herrings (or are they?) that they sprinkled about!
1455	ShephardReborn	2014-07-26	One of the suggested names for the Joffrey's sword was "Terminus" a nice little reference to Gene Wolfe's "Book of the New Sun" series. Another great saga that I read simultaneously with Song of Ice and Fire. The main character from those novels is a professional torturer and headsman carrying a special sword named "Terminus est".

1457	Jslay427	2014-04-13	The way an episode ends always plays a big role in how I view the episode overall. Obviously episode 2 was epic.
1458	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-04-13	I would give it an 8. It had more action than 401, but I still liked 401 a bit better.
1459	Lord Godric	2014-04-13	I gave it an 8, it really wasn't as good as I was hoping it'd be. Â I thought the wedding would be more dramatic, chaotic and overall just better. Â Good to see Joff dead but not as good as I wanted.Â
1460	Widows_Blood	2014-04-13	I gave it a 9.Â
1461	Zman1863	2014-04-13	I think they pulled it off decently, though some of the scenes seemed a bit fatty on the Kings Landing end of things. Also apprehensive about where they are going with the Shae thing, though I have ideas which lead them to the same end.
1462	Autumn is Coming	2014-04-13	I give it an 8 as well. Good amount of KL scenes, some decent Bolton stuff, and the ending really just boosted up the score.
1463	Died a Hero	2014-04-13	9
Â 
Was a bit slow for an R.R. episode. Loved Reek. The telling of Robb's death while the blade was right at this neck was amazing. Stanis was boring. They really are taking the teeth away from him. I understand why they changed Bronn to Jaime's trainer, camera time and all, but it does take away from the on-the-nose training of Ser Payne. The Red Viper was again, very Red Viper. Joff's death was perfect. He was just the right shade of purple.Â 
Â 
All and all I was ready to give this episode a 6 or 7. Then I noticed the three musicains playing the Rain's for Joff was fucking Sigur RA3s! I shouted, "Dude, that's fucking Sigur RA3s!!!!" Everyone in the room just stared at me.
Â

Â 
I thought pre-wedding the scenes just didn't do enough, they were mostly reminders that these characters exist (particularly for the Dragonstone crew). I did like the scene between Roose and Ramsay, but it went on too long. Bran's vision was pretty good too.
Â 
The wedding was great. It was awesome seeing so many characters all in one place again, and all the different interactions. Plus the ending of course.

1468	Ran	2014-04-13	An 8 for me. The Joffrey-Tyrion build up was excellent, but there were a lot of vignettes at the wedding that I didn't find compelling -- too many hammering-the-point moments (Oberyn with his triple "former queen regent", Cersei's "But you love Jaime") which felt labored. Even GRRM can't manage to be subtle on this show.The Bolton material was, OTOH, very good, and I'm liking the family dynamic focus of our first reintroduction to Dragonstone. Nice Bran bit with the vision and the voice of the three-eyed crow, too.
1469	KalibakCruel	2014-04-13	Loved it. 9/10. Liked the Bronn and Jaime scene. Liked the reek, Ramsay and Roose scene. Purple Wedding was great. Loved Oberyn scene. Just a good episode imo.

Brienne being so friendly with Marg and the Tyrells seems very odd to me. The Tyrion and Shae scene was basically the same thing we've already seen several times before only with a new angle from Tyrion, and it was too long.

1491	Jon-Michael Pearson	2014-04-13	I thought it was very slow not much happened beisdes king Joffrey death and that was not a very scene at all.
1492	Obebb	2014-04-13	10/10Â  
Â 
The absolute only thing I didn't like was the Stannis burning, but that was such a small part and not too bad so still 10. Everything else was the bestÂ
1493	ServantOnIce	2014-04-13	9 The Melisandre and Shireen scene seemed forced and out of place. Â  I liked Roose and Ramsay . . Â good scenes.Â
1494	Genre Monkey	2014-04-13	I remember thinking his episode last season was the worst of the entire season. Â So I'm no longer in the "Martin's episode will be the best" mindset.Â 


Â 
Â 
To be fair, I listened to Martin's audio commentary on his episode from the third season, and there were substantial portions that he didn't write. Some of his scenes were shifted to other episodes, and other writer's scenes dropped into his episode. As I believe that is pretty much standard for certain television shows, then I don't think we can put a lot of the blame on Martin if we feel his episodes aren't up to snuff.
1495	tito5601	2014-04-13	the moment roose realises bran and rickon are alive. that deserves a ten on its own
1496	John Hulboy	2014-04-13	I can't get enough and I'm rating it a 10 I knew what was coming but it still felt good to get some revenge on lannisters .
1497	xander_blackfyre	2014-04-13	Been a lurker for a long time on the forums, decided to start posting.Â  Gave it a 9 the death scene made the entire episode worth it but there were other thing I loved, the scene with Bronn and Jamie training was excellent although it was short.
1498	dtones520	2014-04-13	It was a bit choppy. Â Lena headey was terrific though. Â Gave it a 9.

I agree. I actually felt Cersei's anguish when Joff died.
I need to watch the episode again before rating it I think, as I was so excited for the end when Joff dies the rest of the episode was a blurr. But the wedding was really well done, especially the end. The proper amount of super awkard drunk Joff vs Tyrion before Joffs death and Lena did a great, great job showing Cersei's pain.
1499	Ser Blake	2014-04-13	I thought the Bran scene in this episode was phenomenal.Â
1500	Ran	2014-04-13	Genre Monkey,Yeah, episode 7 last year was especially egregious compared to George's scripts for the first two seasons in terms of stuff getting shuffled around.
1501	mimsy187	2014-04-13	Another 8/10 for me.
Brienne being so friendly with Marg and the Tyrells seems very odd to me. The Tyrion and Shae scene was basically the same thing we've already seen several times before only with a new angle from Tyrion, and it was too long.
Other than that I loved it. Bran, Ramsay, Bronn and Jaime, the wedding, Oberyn; all great.


I loved the episode, but I agree with you about how Brienne interacts with Marg/the Tyrells. I think Brienne has played on odd part for all of season 4 so far though. I don't know what your thoughts were with episode 1 of this season, but Brienne's scenes have seemed very awkward (for lack of a better word) to me.
1502	WTFSalami	2014-04-13	its just so wrong....also he is having supper like whatever...." Yeah the wall...Im coming..."
The burning was not even to get a good wind to set sails.
LOL, cuz that would have painted Stannis in a better light.
1503	Ser Jake	2014-04-13	Not sure if I like new Tommen. He's too old. Anyone know why they replaced him?
Â 
Pretty solid episode. Not sure what they are doing to Stannis' story. Enjoyed Bran's scene. Unsure of why they had the Brienne/Cersei conversation... are we supposed to believe that Cersei is jealous of Brienne or something? Wedding was pretty well done, shot really well and all the costumes/props and stuff were really nice. Jack's performance was top notch, per usual. Going to miss his acting on GoT.Â
1504	Sand11751	2014-04-13	Why can't I give it a 20? Best. Fucking. Wedding. Ever. And kudos to Jack Gleeson; terrific acting, remindingÂ us why Joffrey is a total shit!

He'd said he didn't even know about the changes until he saw the show.  He asked whether it was done in editing etc..
1510	Ser Redjed	2014-04-13	A solid 9, given the constraints of episodic television!

1511	Ser Creighton	2014-04-13	I gave it a 9.
Jack killed his death scene. Though some stuff was over the top, the episode was also very subtle.
Tyrion and Joff were outstanding at the wedding, I did not mind the Viper and Cers scene, I rather enjoyed it, I don't really recall the Viper being all that subtle to begin with. Jaime and Bronn I thought worked, I am always ok with more Bronn, thought Mel and Dragonstone was really interesting. Though I sure could use a little Jingle bell rock. Brans vision was great, and I enjoyed the brief scene we got. Theon and Ram were great, I don't really have a complaint.
I just really enjoyed the episode and there were subtle clues I think people are missing, that Martin dropped in there, going to watch it again and look it's starting. Da da da da  Da da da da.

1513	ohpooratlas	2014-04-13	I gave it an 8. The end scene was a solid 10 and I had so many chills, and some of the stuff before the wedding was great too ... but Team Dragonstone felt completely out of place in this episode. Loved, loved, loved everything with the Boltons. The Bran scene was alright. I got super excited over the visions bit if only because we haven't had hardly ANY ... but really, they didn't even reveal that much save for the dragon shadow over the Red Keep.
Â 
Oberyn vs. The Lannisters = GOLD. When Oberyn got his final "murdering women and children" line in, I was like "BOOM."
Â 
And of course ... the Wedding. They did such a fantastic job of building the tension with Joffrey and Tyrion. And focusing on Sansa's grief as they mocked her brother was a nice little added touch. I have to also say Lena Headey was in fine form for this episode. I love that we are truly starting to see small bits of her paranoia as well as the whole Queen vs. Former Queen Regent dynamic.
Â 
One of the most satisfying ends to an episode ever.
1514	Gannicus	2014-04-13	+ Oberyn/Ellaria vs Tywin/Cersei
+ Jamie and Bronn
+ Queen of Thorns
+ Well executed Wedding
+ No Danny
+ Stannis sticking up for Shireen
Â 
Â 
- Tyrion/Shae
- Another step towards religious fanaticism for Stannis.
Â 
Â 
I was also hoping for "Don't make me rue the day..." from Roose but I guess there is still time.

1515	Florent Vixen	2014-04-13	I give it a 8 and think it was generally satisfying. Better than the RW.
I was hoping it would be more chaotic and that Joffrey would be more
foaming at the mouth making a fool of himself crazy. The Queen of
Thorns & Oberyn were very good.
Jaime/Bronn was good.
Cersei/ Brienne scene. WTF?  
Fat Walda! Hopefully, Ramsay won't kill her. She's one of the less
odious Freys and harmless. The actor that plays Roose is very good.
Mel/Shireen scene, blah. Not sure where they're going with Selyse.
But I doubt they hired a name actress like Tara Fitzgerald to just
be unpleasant boring book Selyse.

Cersei/Brie = you are right. Let the shipping begin as Martin wrote that.
1517	Lady Beyond the Wall	2014-04-13	I was also hoping for the "Don't make me rue..." line. I thought that scene was a little soft. 
For me, this episode had quite a few disappointments. I was watching in Chicago with friends who had not read the books, and from that perspective Bran's vision made no sense. I in addition to the scene with Roose being soft, I think dontos's come-with-me-if-you-want-to-live was ill timed. I can't believe no one would see that when all eyes are on the royal family. Over all everything seemed rushed.
1518	IlAovatar	2014-04-13	Only a 6/10 from me.
Â 
The start of the episode reminded me how disappointed I am with the casting and portrayal of the Boltons.
Â 
I wasn't overly impressed by the royal wedding either. New Tommen was an irritating distraction that undermined the whole affair, and for some reason I found Joffrey and Tyrion's standoff a lot less tense than some of their previous spats. The death scene wasn't as underwhelming as I feared it might have been, but they still could have done more to make it as horrific as the books.

As to your last point, really? I never read it as gruesome as this. More frantic maybe, but I thought the visual was spot on.

This description of the events sounds way more horrific to me:
Â 
"Joffrey began to claw at his throat, his nails tearing bloody gouges in the flesh. Beneath the skin, the muscles stood out hard as stone. Prince Tommen was screaming and crying.
He is going to die, Tyrion realized. He felt curiously calm, though pandemonium raged all about him. They were pounding Joff on the back again, but his face was only growing darker. Dogs were barking, children were wailing, men were shouting useless advice at each other. Half the wedding guests were on their feet, some shoving at each other for a better view, others rushing for the doors in their haste to get away.
Ser Meryn pried the king's mouth open to jam a spoon down his throat. As he did, the boy's eyes met Tyrion's. He has Jaime's eyes. Only he had never seen Jaime look so scared. The boy's only thirteen. Joffrey was making a dry clacking noise, trying to speak. His eyes bulged white with terror, and he lifted a hand... reaching for his uncle, or pointing... Is he begging my forgiveness, or does he think I can save him? "Noooo," Cersei wailed, "Father help him, someone help him, my son, my son..."
1522	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-04-13	7.5/10
Â 
I think the season premiere was better, to be honest. There weren't as many awesome lines/moments in this episode, and it was rather slow up until the wedding.

The clawing WAS missed, I thought it would've added a lot. But i don't know, his face getting all blue and bloody looked good imo
1524	Nictarion	2014-04-13	I gave it an 8. Solid episode, the wedding was pretty good, as was the Roose/Ramsay dynamic. My favorite part was definitley Bran and the Weirwood tree, very cool scene. Overall nothing i didnt like.
1525	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-04-13	Just watched it a second time. This one was great, but the last one was perfect. I gave this one a 9.
Best parts:
Bolton family
Bran Vision: I noticed a flash of something that didn't appear to be from a prior episode. When I went back and paused it, you can see what appears to be the White Walker from one of the trailers. The camera is facing up and looking through frozen ice as if someone is trapped under frozen water. 
Stannis line: I've suffered through things I hate my entire life. 
Sansa: She had like one line, but her facial expressions throughout the EP were so spot on that she didn't need to say anything for you to know how she was feeling. 
Cersei and Jamie being side by side as their son died. 
Joffrey's death was executed perfectly. 
The only thing I thought could have been better was a little bit more chaos as Joff died. However, what I loved most about this episode was how they set the audience up to hate Joffrey even more. I mean I already hated him, but after he made those comments about chopping Ned Stark's head off in front of Sansa I really wanted him dead.

1526	lil_z	2014-04-13	Great Episode a solid 9. I cried when the focus was on Sansa when the death of her father was reinacted. The looks were heavy. Specially from Oberyn, the weight, like he was looking at someone else tortured by the Lanisters. It made the end more poignant.

i didn't cry but
1528	kephv	2014-04-13	An 8, though that's perhaps too generous. It was saved by the smaller moments, since the large one's felt a bit dull -- especially the Joff and Tyrion scenes (I'm aware it's straight from the books but it felt so commonplace; perhaps it was the acting but it was all a bit lifeless). Boltons, Bronn and Jaime, Varys and Tyrion, Tyrion and Jaime, and Jaime and Loras were all good, as was Bran's small scene.
1529	DogLover	2014-04-13	I'm rating this a 9, which is generous for me. So far, "The Battle of the Blackwater" is the only solid 10.  I think this episode held up to my second bests, "And Now His Watch Has Ended" and "Kissed by Fire".  I thought the Ramsey intro was amazing and set the pace. I loved the scene between Roose and Ramsey. I even liked the Bronn/Jaime dynamic. Bran's visions gave me chills. And the Purple Wedding delivered. I absolutely loved the dwarves' reenacting the Wot5K. My only complaint is the disposal of Shae. If that's the end of her, I'll be furious. That's over-the-top whitewashing of Tyrion.
ETA: I was also disappointed with the Stannis scene. I don't recognize this character and I'm tired of my Unsullied friends referring to him as a loser.

1530	averde	2014-04-13	Frankly I was disappointed with this episode.
1531	Seneti	2014-04-13	8/10. It was a good episode, but slightly underwhelming in the end. I expected far more grief and despair from Cersei and more extravagance and action from the rest of the wedding. Everything else was really good, though. Also, any episodes that have characters like Joffrey biting the dust are good episodes

Yes, and also harsh wrt Shae. 
But Tyrion had already described that he'd tried asking her nicely, and with Varys' reminder "have you ever known your father to make idle threats??" ... I suppose he was just trying to protect her in the end.
Hell if I know though = )
1533	IamMe90	2014-04-13	Gave the episode a 6; the only part I really liked a lot was the wedding.Â 
Â 
- absolutely hated the Shae/Tyrion scene. The acting seemed stiff, the dialogue.. ugh, and if she's really gone, well, that'll be a horrible ending to the show's entirely unsatisfactory treatment of the arc (i sincerely hope this isn't the case).Â 
Â 
- Cersei/Brienne dialogue is weird and out of place.Â 
Â 
- Stannis scene didn't really add anything positive to the episode IMO.
Â 
- Sansa's exit seemed a little rushed. Also, her necklace seemed kind of irrelevant.Â 
Â 
- I don't really understand what the KL vision that Daenerys saw in the HoTU is doing in Bran's vision (are they same? Looked like it to me.)
Â 
- Who was that random chick that Ramsey called "my love?" lol
Â 
The Bolton interactions were mostly good, and I did think the purple wedding was pretty successful. I just really didn't like the preceding scenes that much.Â
1534	Queen of Whores	2014-04-13	6/10. Very average, and a bit underwhelming. The Purple Wedding was good, but the rest not very good. And Stannis burningÂ infidels?Â FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!!!! I can't believe this show. STANNIS IS AN ATHEIST IN THE BOOKS HIMSELF FFS! I suppose the show is aiming to make Stannis the new villain instead of Ramsay. Words can't describe how angry I am at the show right now. Honestly, if the rest of the season is gonna be like this, then I'm going to count myselfÂ veryÂ disappointed.

1535	lostinwesteros	2014-04-13	I gave it an 8. Not as good as last week.  Disappointed somewhat with the PW.  It just seemed a bit rushed and one dimensional.  Did love the scene btw Red Viper and Cersei/Tywin.
Great scene with Bran 
	Spoiler  and Bloodraven 
, but I wonder how much of it makes sense to non-book readers.
Interesting action at Dreadfort btw Roose and Ramsey.  Poor Theon struggling with grief over learning Robb was murdered.  And, gulp, Fat Walda is really fat!
1536	Oriolesmagic	2014-04-13	I gave the episode an 8 out of 10, mostly due to the Bolton scenes and how great the final scene was.
The other scenes were somewhat of a disappointment, I felt like everyone was entirely too calm for a wedding of that proportion. I also feel like the Brienne scene was pretty strange and didn't really need to be there.
2 things,
Was there any mention of Joffrey having "experience with Valryian steel?" I feel like that's an important revelation and ties up a mini mystery from early on in the series. Perhaps Tyrion will make mention of it in the dungeon?
Also, Shae is not gone for good, take a look at this trailer at 1:05... It looks like a scene that book readers should be familiar with.https://www.youtube....h?v=fUOdwZhWnLA

That's a strecth. Everyone who's butthurt over Stannis needs to calm down and wait for episode 9.

This one hundred percent. 
I may actually stop watching the show. I was never one of the hardcore Stannis fans (I'm one of the few who liked/ supported Renly) but to see such a great and dynamic book character become this on the show is despicable.
1539	Queen of Whores	2014-04-14	That's a strecth. Everyone who's butthurt over Stannis needs to calm down and wait for episode 9.

Yeah.... Stannis is my favourite character in all of ASoIaF... of course I'm pissed off. Anyone would be to see their favourite character destroyed episode by episode.

That episode literally changes nothing. I'm not even that big of a Stannis fan but the TV creators have gone to an extreme to make him unlikeable, for frankly no reason.

Am I the only one who DOESN'T care for book Stannis? I mean he still burns people, he's still a hypocrite. Not too likeable imo.

You guys are acting like Stannis is some charismatic bamf in the books. He's just some misguided fool that still believes the throne belong to those by right.

Â 
So far, this is the episode that has upset me THE MOST.So far Lena Headey has KILLED is as queen Cercei and by killed it, I mean she has been above and beyond expectation, but tonight, just as Michelle Fairley, she has utterly failed to express the panic of a mother losing her child. Denial is the first stage of grief, as Michelle skipped straight to step 4, depression, Lena skipped to step : 2 anger, but nonetheless she failed to express step 1, denial. Making the whole rendition not credible, fake and plastic. This is my first GoT epic fail. King Joffrey's death was such an anticipated moment... but it turned out shit.

Â 
How is he misguided if he isÂ actually right? The throne legallyÂ isÂ his. And in the books heÂ never, everÂ burns or harms people who don't believe in the Lord of Light. He lets people believe whatever they want, since he himself is an atheist. There are actually two groups, the king's men (those that fully support Stannis and aren't believers of the Lord of Light) and the queen's men, the opposite. Stannis' Hand of the King is an "infidel" ffs. He doesn't care. Also, he is a badass in the books. 
	Spoiler He is the only king of the original five that is still standing, and absolutely refuses to surrender or give in. He's saved Jon Snow, a character many love, and then gone on to do battle against the most despised characters in the series, the Freys and Boltons, and he is vastly outnumbered, but he still insists on freeing Winterfell and bringing justice to the Boltons. Like this quote:
Â 
"I am not Robert. But we will march, and we will free Winterfell â<U+0080>¦ or die in the attempt."Â

He is definitely a hypocrite and in my opinion fairly unlikeable but still an interesting and complex character who is enjoyable to read about. The character on the show is nothing like him.

He's a pretty widely liked character based off these boards at least. I don't even like him that much I just think that Stannis has been so poorly written on the show without any aspects of his character that it's sad to see such a character go to waste.

Â 
The Baratheons won it through conquest, which legally makes it theirs. It's a law that's been passed on since Aegon invaded. Joffrey (unknowingly) took it through trickery and deceit through his mother. There is a huge difference.

And lo and be hold, all of the positives you listed of Stannis has yet to appear in the show so what's the current complaint?
Â 
He is misguided in the same way the Starks are misguided: He actually still believes in honor and duty. It seems the people nitpicking about Stannis is how the show is portraying him as some un-charismatic (he is) dark character (he is). Book fans of his also seem to forgo that he is the biggest kinslayer in all of Westeros.Â

Â 
Those specific events have not happened yet, no, but all the things Stannis says that make him a more likable, understandable and complex character have been completely left out of the show. Go over to A Wiki of Ice and Fire and read all of Stannis' quotes. They make him a much more multi-dimensional and complex character, and yetÂ noneÂ of them have been taken over to the show. These quotes humanize him a lot, and make him seem more sympathetic and interesting.
Â 
The biggest kinslayer in all of Westeros? Ahhh yes, I suppose we should support Renly in his pursuit of murdering his brother and usurping his legal right. Yeah, that sounds more fairÂ

Â 
Not knowing makes it different? Knowingly or not, Joffrey took the throne. Since that war was won by Joffrey, it's his line that's legal now. Robert unseated the king, Joff made it so the king never even sat the chair. I'd say Joff's line is the legal line now.
Â 
Moreover, what does it all matter? Robert's line is the legal line because he managed to usurp the old king? So before he officially sat the throne we should have all sided with the Mad King since legally Robert couldn't rebel? But once he DID sit the throne we side with HIS line? Well now we should side with Joff's line since HE sits the throne, usurping Stannis' line, knowingly or not.Â

This isn't the appropriate thread for who is the legal heir of Westeros. 
I don't understand how people can argue against Stannis fans being upset on how poorly the character has been portrayed on TV. I just watched him burn a man for being an "infidel". 
What they've done to Stannis would be the equivalent of making Theons character have no love for the Starks or love for Robb. It took away a whole aspect of Stannis character and made him something he's not.
1558	A Man Reads	2014-04-14	8/10
Â 
The Purple Wedding -ItÂ seemed underwhelming. They had all the necessary shots of the right people touching the right goblets and necklaces, and all the necessary facial expressions to leave most people guessing as to who did it. But that made it sluggish. The sequence between Joffrey and Tyrion over the wine relied too heavily on the book.
Â 
Stannis -Â I am in the minority, but I think Stannis is very well depicted in the show. He's an awkward guy. A guy who has been unlucky and unhappy in life. A guy who goes along with many things that he wouldn't otherwise go along with were he not Robert's heir. That's who he is in the books too. He nevertheless soldiers on through his considerable deficiencies to do his duty and bring justice to Westeros. His facial expressions during the burning and dinner in this episode were classic Stannis. His firmness in prohibiting the use of the rod on Shireen is also classic Stannis. He would make a poor modern day president or prime minister, but he'd make a damn fine king.
Â 
Boltons - Loved it! Season 3 E10 began with the symbolic "Rise of Roose" walk up to the battlements of the Twins. I hope to see more of them. Ramsay's character is just phenomenal.
1559	Giorgio Corrado	2014-04-14	Great episode just one thing Tywin will need to find a new music score for his family reall everytime the Rains of Castamyre is played someone dies.Â  This time YES it was that spoiled brat Joffrey but I still wonder are we sure the poison was in Joffrey's wine because because I think it was in the pie.Â  I also got to love how the Red Viper got to stick it to Tywin and Cersei.

Agreed and I apologize.
Â 
I don't know, I just think Stannis fans take it overboard. I don't think he's a GREAT characterization. But I don't think he's horrible either. The way I read him was unlikeable, dark, and prone to burning people because the red woman says so.Â 
Â 
But back on topic. I'd like to add in that I liked the (well I think it was done on purpose) the part where Joff eats the pie, then stops for a second like he's about to choke, then calls to to Tyrion. I felt like it was for the book readers to kind of rise up in our seats for a second, then fall back into them for another minute.

I agree on the pie thing. I had a moment of "wait what it's the pie but what about...." And then he yelled for Tyrion
1563	Eira Seren	2014-04-14	Gave it a 9.
Â 
I want to watch it again, feels like maybe I missed some details at the wedding feast and maybe wasn't paying close enough attention to the earlier part of the episode, was in so much anticipation of the outcome.
Â 
Favorite Things:
Â 
They didn't recast Ilyn Payne merely for the sake of Jamie's training.Â  Nobody can replace Wilko Johnson.
Joffrey's dead!Â  He was superb at acting dreadful leading up to it, and was wildly successful at looking dreadful while dyingÂ  
Nearly everyone who's a suspect managed to touch Joff's cup in the buildup.
Stannis riding Melisandre and Renly riding Loras during the battle (and Loras getting offended),
Plenty of fighting words.Â  Liked the exchange between Loras and Jamie and Oberyn's cutting remarks regarding Elia
I'm liking Brienne this season
Oberyn and Loras checking each other out
Melisandre looks happy and healthy while eating the 'spoiled meat,' while Stannis and Selyse look like they're wasting away.Â  Creepy.
Rebel Shireen
Finally Tyrion doesn't look so nice when breaking up with Shae
Interesting visions in the weirnet, and Bran getting a bit wolfish
Reek, Alfie Allen is doing an excellent job
Ramsay's expressions, as if Roose had really just said "Don't make me rue the day I raped your mother"
Â 
Disliked
Â 
Sometimes the episode seemed a bit cobbled together, as if they were trying to figure out what to do with the parts that weren't taken up by the PW
I guess the necklace was easier to film than a hairnet?
Bran saying "I know where we need to go" after the weirnet vision seemed a bit contrived
No "I'll take two chickens"

1565	Ebethron the Sword	2014-04-14	I gave it a 6, based on initial impressions while watching it. Â While there were parts I thought were well done, overall I was disappointed in the episode, especially for one George is credited with. Â This is one of those episodes where I felt there was some check-box list of things that must be included, and the outline required that they all be shoehorned in there.
Â 
I've been trying hard to watch the show with somewhat fresh eyes, but episodes like these make that hard to do (doesn't help that I just completed a re-read of all the source materials a week ago).
1566	Aldi_AA	2014-04-14	That's a strecth. Everyone who's butthurt over Stannis needs to calm down and wait for episode 9.

1571	The Killer Snark	2014-04-14	I somewhat generously gave it an eight. A solid episode, but not especially inspired, and to be honest the most anticipated episode after the Red Wedding turned out to be a bit of a missed opportunity. The Dreadfort scenes were very good, but were narratively rushed, and slightly mishandled the relationship between Roose and Ramsay. Too much interfering with how things go down in the books. The last appearance of Shae was a complete disaster and exceeded my worst expectations of how they'd go with her character arc. It seems the producers were simply too timid to have things pan out the way they do in the novels for fear of alienating viewers, and have decided to whitewash both Shae and Tyrion in case viewers aren't smart enough to realise Tywin would be the one to blame if they'd kept things they way they end in ASoS. Even for a non-reader viewer, the way their relationship ends onscreen should seem like a big build-up to nothing. So that's my main annoyance with the episode. Aside from that, there are minor problems caused by having to resolve too many changes to the chronology of the source. And the show's treatment of Stannis is by now a lost cause; let's hope he fares better in development of his character in The North.
Â 
The wedding was not big enough, Penny the dwarf made no appearance, and there wasn't enough of a build-up to it. Oberyn and Tyrion's relationship is furthered in the third novel by this point. The rancour between Joffrey and Tyrion is built up just prior to the wedding feast, which makes it apparent Joffrey sees his humiliation of his uncle there as a warning and revenge. The bleeding at the nose and eyes was a nice touch, but there was no throat-tearing from Joffrey, and the show made it too obvious who one of his murderers is. He chokes to death too quickly too. His face has turned black before he finally kicks the bucket in the book.
Â 
Enjoyable stuff, but too many shortcuts and fluffed moments I think to satisfy a lot of casual viewers or those familiar with the novels. Too many changes that don't work, though the wedding feast itself is pretty faithful in the main. I really think they should have cut out all of the side-stuff in this and set the entire episode at King's Landing in order to do as full as possible justice to the source.

1574	Sun	2014-04-14	a 7 from me.Â 
Â 
The ep started very well with the Boltons and ended beautifully with the wedding. The middle bits of Bran and Stannis were a bit meh, especially the Bran sequence.
Â 
I should add that I also thought that the pre-wedding KL scenes were rather weak. The dialogue was mundane, to say the least. Especially in the Olenna/Tywin, Jaime/Bronne, with special emphasis on the Jaime/Loras (that was truly awful). Actually come to think of it, a lot of the writing in the episode was weak.Â 
Â 
The 7 goes almost entirely to the Tyrion/Joffery interactions during the wedding and Â to the Bolton scenes. I gave the premier a deserving 8, it is the stronger episode of the two.Â

1577	Ran	2014-04-14	234 votes in and it averaging 8.50. Normalizing (top and bottom 5% removed) and it climbs to 8.65. The median score is 9.
1578	Young Biff	2014-04-14	Long story short everything we were looking for was there. Dantos popped up. Tyrion was left in limbow for suspense sake. Cersie seemed batshit blatantly for the first time in a long time and the entire wedding conglomeration lost their cool. All I wanted and more.
1579	BlackTalon	2014-04-14	The episode was a bit disappointing, the first few scenes felt disjointed and either overly long (Dreadfort) or confusing (Bran), the wedding and the death were not nearly as dramatic as I had hoped.
Â 
6/10.
1580	AnotherCrannogman	2014-04-14	It w a good. Better than episode one but still too much happening and too many different scenes. They need to slow down and do less each episode.
1581	The Killer Snark	2014-04-14	Agreed. This would have been a lot more focused and better if they'd just stayed all episode at KL. It is, after all, the send off of Joffrey. Why not have an ep long build-up to his death. Interestingly, this was penned by Martin, who also penned (bar the Theon gelding) the choppiest and least effective episode last season. Authors aren't necessarily the best people to adapt their own work, but I'm guessing he might have felt a bit hindered at having to resolve too many deviations prior writers have put forth.

1582	Mr Smith	2014-04-14	9.5 for me, rounded up to a 10. Last 20 minutes pulled it over the line.
Â 
Purple Wedding itself was surprisingly true to the book, right down the the Pigeon Pie and the dwarves, which I really didn't think they'd include. Bran's vision was a little odd, but most of the Bolton stuff was excellent. All King's Landing scenes appreciated.
1583	Waylin Stark	2014-04-14	A solid 8.
Â 
I feel this episode could have skipped Stannis' and Bran's stories and jumped straight to KL after Reek and the Boltons.
With so many colorful characters in KL in one spot, they could have branched out more.Â 
Â 
Olenna could have talked about Mace making it clear she thought he was an idiot, a longer Loras and Jaime scene, more of Cersei and maybe Varys. Oberyn could have been more involved.
Â 
But towards the end it got really fantastic.
1584	The Monkey	2014-04-14	8/10.
Â 
The wedding was good, Jack Gleeson did a splendid job as always. Â The dwarf re-enactment of the War of the Five Kings was wonderful and horrible at the same time. But somehow I was left feeling a bit underwhelmed, I don't know why.Â 
Â 
I enjoyed the Bran visions, and the Dreadfort scene.
Â 
Stannis' burning of the "infidels" wasn't in-character, but I have never been a fan of that hypocrite anyway, so I'm not that bothered. Â

I'm giving it a minus 2 for the overacting of Lena Headey and Pedro Pascal, the bored acting of Charles Dance, NCW and for everyone else in Kings Landing who looked like they are all just phoning it in for what could have been an amazing episode.
1589	Blackheart	2014-04-14	This just goes to show that Joffrey's Death is more important than Cersei's BoobsÂ  Â
1590	Queen of Whores	2014-04-14	This just goes to show that Joffrey's Death is more important than Cersei's BoobsÂ  Â 


Â 
I wouldn't say that Â
1591	A Man Of Iron	2014-04-14	6/10. It was a mess.
1592	SirRunty	2014-04-14	Gotta say I thought a lot of this episode was pretty weak. It did have some great moments and decent character interchanges but I felt not enough was happening until the last 5-10 minutes. This is one of the few episodes I've not much cared for. But hey, nothing's perfect - and I liked Joffrey's death.
1593	Conchobar	2014-04-14	I thought the Bran scene in this episode was phenomenal.Â 


I agree! I am really looking forward to his scenes this season.
1594	dbunting	2014-04-14	Gave it an 8. Liked most of it, to me Dragonstone was my least favorite part this week.Liked that they gave the 3 eyed crow a voice, people who didn't know that the crow, wasn't just a crow should now be interested more.Liked Loras' jab at Jaime as he walked away...basically, You will never marry her either sister f'er!And any episode where the King prick dies has to be good.Liked fat Walda appearance, again, wonder how many remember he got her weight in silver?
1595	Jamie Lannister	2014-04-14	7/10. Excellent ending and the Ramsay/Roose scenes were great, but the rest of it felt a little plodding and slow. The continued blackwashing of Stannis bothers me a bit, but I actually liked the Mel/Shireen scene.Â 
Â 
I was worried they were going to botch or ignore the climax's build up in regards to Tyrion vs Joff, but it was done well enough. Decent episode and a good send-off to one of the show's best actors.Â
1596	TheEvilKing	2014-04-14	Gave it a 10. The Wedding was hella fun, I don't think I've seen that many named characters in a single place on TV before. Led to some nice little interactions, and they played the whodunnit angle well. Marg, Cersei and Tyrion were all great but Joffrey stole the show. A masterful performance.
Â 
The Dreadfort and Dragonstone scenes were so dark and sinister but in different ways. I worry for that Myranda chick, she'll be hound meat soon too, I'm sure. Either that or they'll make her FakeArya.
Â 
The Bran scene wasn't much of anything, but whatever. I'm not expecting much there until they reach Bloodraven or Coldhands.
1597	Lord of Winterhell	2014-04-14	Gave it a 9, but might change it to 10 after rewatch. Not sure about Stannis scene, everything else was great.
1598	Ser Graymax	2014-04-14	Still great TV, fantastic sets and costumes but I only gave it a 7.
Â 
Underwealming episode, No illian Payne (though I understand why), plodding plotlines.Â Â  Maybe I just expected too much after last week.Â  Glad Jeoffry is dead but very meh scripting.Â  Actor was terrific as usual though.Â  Tyrion just phoned it in. (First time I ever felt that way about him) The midget entertainers just sucked but they did get the point across.
Â 
I may have to watch it again in case it was just the mood of the night.
1599	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-14	I went for a 9 but it could have easily been a 10. The ending is a massive indicator for any episode if there's a big moment since the rest of the episode generally builds to that, and this was no different. Superb final scene in it's execution.
1600	mediterraneo	2014-04-14	I'm officially underwhelmed by the episode.
It was dispersive before the wedding, and underwhelming on its climax.
Â 
Maybe the lack of tension I felt is due to me already knowing what was going to happen. I admit I was in removal when Ramsey killed one of his girls.
Â 
Maybe the soundtrack could have helped more.
Â 
And yes, the show lost in subtle messages being forwarded.
Now it is not just one instance with the Viper, a little girl can be blunt in front of Melisandre, the Queen puts herself on the same level of a famous ugly woman and Jaime... Well, Jaime could be as direct and blunt as he was with Loras but... on THAT matter?
After pushing a boy from a window to hide it? The risk is lower now but...
Â 
I'm underwhelmed, if slightly, and for the second time in a row.
The season is sub-optimal, up to now!
1601	ladyinblack	2014-04-14	I gave it an 8 after watching again. I think this season is starting off much better than the last 2. They totally botched the RW & the episodes leading up to it.
Â Interesting to see Bronn become Jaimes sparring partner-guess 'cause he is such a fan favorite. Hard to replace Ilyn though---he became Jaimes confessor and there was always something dark & menacing about the guy
Shae--the show has spent much time making her the whore with the heart of gold & she isn't that in the books at all. Guessing the Lannisters on the show have her hidden away somewhere
Cersei was brillant and of course, the Queen of Thorns--adding extra dialogue
Glad Dontos is back
Dwarf fight was excellent & degrading to many of course
Boltons---good but since when did Ramsay have any female friends?
Brans vision---yes
Stannis----let him be STANNISÂ Â

1602	aFeastForDragons	2014-04-14	5/10. I gave last weeks 10/10.
Â 
This episode was massively underwhelming especially since last weeks premiere was incredible.Most of this episode was written by George which is really strange.
Â 
Cons:
Joffery's death was dragged out way to long. They made it to obvious and forced.Â 
A lot of the conversations were really bad aswell like Oberyn openly insulting Tywin and Cersei.
Â 
Stannis burning someone who refused to convert Â Â 
He is supposed to be an atheist!!!! Using Mel and her religion ultimately for his own gain.
This is what really brought the episode down for me.
Â 
Pros:
"Your bother tells me you shit gold just like your father"
Â 
Ramsey and Roose. So much tension. Locke and Ramsey being buddies was a great addition.
Â 
Reek
Â 
Bran's vision. Graphics were a little bad but still very good. No cold hands though:(
Â 
Wedding looked amazing
Â 
No Dany which is a nice change. Not a dany hater but sick of her being showcased as the main character.
Â 
War of the 5 kings
1603	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-04-14	I don't understand all this outrage over Stannis. Honestly, I thought he was mostly a prick until a certain point in the books that should be around episode 9. The show has just chosen to accentuate the more prickly side of his nature, but to come to the conclusion that he's going to be next major villain is a major stretch. Lets also remember this is Game of Thrones. The majority of the characters are not all good or evil.Â

Â 
I don't get it either. Stannis has been like this for two seasons. Book Stannis != Show Stannis. We should know this by now. He might end up where he does at the end of ASOS but he's clearly taking a different and more direct route. Just don't understand why people are still having the same complaints when they know that show Stannis is different and has been for 2 years.

1605	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-04-14	The only thing I'll say in their defense is they could have given a better reason for burning the traitors than their religious beliefs. That was messed up, but not grievous enough for me to fault the episode on its entirety. Overall it was a great episode, but EP1 is still my favorite of the season so far!

Â 
They are portraying him terribly and if the majority of Stan fans are appalled at his character then D & D are massively f**king up his story.Â 
Â 
There are hundreds of posts explaining in detail why so do a little research.

1607	James Sucellus	2014-04-14	Stannis isn't Stannis in the show. I accepted that during Season 2. It's rubbish, but that's how it is.
Â 
I thought it was a great episode. Solid 8/10.
1608	TheHouseHB	2014-04-14	I gave it a 9 just because Joffrey died and we got a taste of Ramsey
1609	Mexal	2014-04-14	Its not the destination its the journey.

Â 
Yes, but they've been doing this for two years. So while you hate his portrayal and it is different from the book, it's consistent within the show and that's the important piece at this point. Figured people would give up by now given it's been like this for the past two seasons but I was wrong. Every Stannis scene will elicit the same reaction until Stannis is dead or the show is over. Gotcha.
1610	Cyvasse Khal	2014-04-14	9/10 for me.
Â 
I thought the wedding was great, I loved every minute of it. Even the conversations and interactions that didn't happen in the book but were included in the show even though they didn't add much, I didn't care because it was just cool to see characters interacting that don't usually get the chance to like Cersei/Brienne, an early Loras/Jaime etc.
Â 
Bolton stuff was great. Bran's vision was cool, I suspect only one scene an episode from Bran this season otherwise he'll be at the end of ADwD already.
Â 
Yeah Stannis continues to be mishandled, and so the only point this ep loses was the burning. I did quite like the scene of Melisandre presenting her religion from her POV to Shireen(the audience). We've had similar scenes before but I felt like it was needed to save Stannis from being the villain from now on.
Â 
Other thoughts include: I worry Tommen and Myrcella have not been built up enough. The show doesn't have the luxury of Cersei chapters where she thinks about all her kids quite regularly. When Tommen becomes King by default i think the TV only watchers will be like "wait what? have we seen him before?". Also, they should be reinforcing that as much as Oberyn hates the Lannisters, they can't touch him because of Myrcella. It was slipped in so quickly in that conversation and it's because they haven't paid any mind to Myrcella being in Dorne since she was shipped off.
1611	aFeastForDragons	2014-04-14	Â

Â 
Stannis was amazing in season 2. I don't know why people didn't like his portrayal then but it was very true to his book character pre-Blackwater. Ruthless, determined, will do anything to achieve his goals and number 1 listens to Davos. Season 3 just made a mockery of his redemption and development.
Â 
Its the fact they went out of their way to make him look bad.
Â 
"I told him to burn his idols"
Â 
That might be the worse piece of dialogue I've heard in this show. They could have put in anything from trying to make peace with the Lannisters to stealing food from storage. Anything would have been a better reason than he didn't convert because I told him to. Thats not the Stannis from the books we all know.

1612	House Targlannistark	2014-04-14	FINALLY THAT FUCKER DIED!Â  Â 
Well done acting, Jack GleesonÂ  Â
1613	Mel_Rose	2014-04-14	I gave it a 10. The only thing that bothered me was Shae, but Book!Shae has been annoying for ages now that I'm kinda used to it - it's like having around a family member that you don't like but have to put up with.
Â 
Love Oberyn and Ellaria's chat with Tywin and Cersei. Loved the wedding. Super-loved the dwarves' play - much better than in the books where Tyrion was the sole target. One skit to offend them all Â  It was great to have all those glances at people looking concerned (Varys, Oberyn, Tywin) or humiliated (Tyrion) or enraged (Sansa, Loras) - or amused (Cersei). Great work.
Â 
Good stuff from Theon and Ramsay and Roose; Selyse and Shireen; Bran's vision. So, in short, excellent episode
1614	The Great Unwashed	2014-04-14	I'm honestly surprised that this episode is getting as many high ratings as I've seen among the fans here.Â  I gave it a 6/10.
Â 
There just wasn't a whole lot to like about the episode, especially since so much of it centered around the wedding, which I felt was WAY off.Â  The Roose/Ramsey/Reek stuff was superb, and I thought the Tyrion/Shae interaction was great.Â  The stuff with Bran was good, but I think they missed something by not heading to the Wall.Â  I also loved the scene with Jaime and Tyrion.
Â 
I feel they really dropped the ball with the Sansa/Dontos storyline.Â  They either should have been building up to that the whole time, or they should have written Dontos out entirely.Â  As it was, none of it made sense with him coming up to her and telling her she had to leave with him if she wanted to live.
Â 
The "War of the 5 Kings" skit felt forced and superfluous, and Tyrion's joke at Joffrey's expense was needlessly long and convoluted...someone needs to remind the master of wit in the seriesÂ that brevity is its soul.Â  I agree with the sentiment expressed above that Dinklage felt like he was phoning it in, although his stare-down with Joffrey was great.
Â 
And why did the focus on the wedding have to last nearly the entire last half of the show?Â  Some cuts away would have been welcome...as it was it seemed like they were just trying to throw as many possible meetings of characters together as possible, but none of it was dramatic or pertinent.Â  And given that Martin was the writer, I was doubly disappointed.
1615	The Amethyst Empress	2014-04-14	I loved it!!
I'm so happy Â
1616	MarcusLloydAK	2014-04-14	I gave it a 9, I expected the wedding to be so much more extravagant. But apart from that loved it. Love how Margaery is a main player in the show, as in the books we seldom saw her. Love that Selyse is back, think a lot of us were worried her season 3 appearance would have been a one-off. Love Ellaria and Oberyn. Olenna Redwyne is awesome.
Â 
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE VALE AND LYSA THIS SEASON!
1617	The Great Unwashed	2014-04-14	One other thing that bugged me about the episode was the interaction between Melisandre and Shireen.Â  I do love the girl that plays Shireen, and I thought the addition of her scenes with Davos last season were inspired, but I couldn't figure out the angle on this meeting between these two characters.
1618	scotcat	2014-04-14	8/10 from me. It wasn't perfect, but still a good cut above the majority of what's on TV at the moment.Â 
Â 
Jack Gleeson has done an excellent job - I've always said its harder to play a villain than a hero - as Joffrey and, as much as I'm glad to see Joffrey meet his maker, Â I'm sorry to see him go.Â
1619	Lyanna's Winter Rose	2014-04-14	I have it a 9
1620	Ser Lawrence	2014-04-14	Gave it a 9.Â  It did not give me chills like Dany taking the unsullied, or the RW, but it was pretty damn good.
Â 
Stannis stuff, less so, but the TV show can't be an unabridged reading of the novels.Â  
Â 
I liked the totally offensive War of the Five Kings rather than the Little-Person-Joust.Â  I've been to weddings where someone thinks something is funny when it is not even remotely appropriate or in keeping with decorum.Â  Plus, it gave the 'readers' something new and semi-unexpected.
Â 
Bran stuff seemed more for readers than "unsullied" watchers.Â  I could watch Bronn and Jamie spar for half the episode.Â  Fun.Â  Sorry for the actor who played the King's Justice.Â  Better this than a re-cast due to illness.
Â 
It's fun to be here at work listening to "unsullied" speculating as to who did what and how, and where did Shae go.
Â 
Still love the show (especially the music).Â  I'll go pretty much wherever they want to take me, unless it gets too ridiculous.
1621	Daenerys Must Die	2014-04-14	Another 8 for me - the bookends stood out most to me in Roose/Ramsay's interactions and the execution of the actual meat & potatoes of the wedding.. the in between was touch and go.
Â 
Stannis stuff was as I expected.. I understand why they stuck the sacrifice into this episode but I'm not sure that angle is overly important or even sticks with the average viewer..
Â 
The episode felt a lot better upon viewing it a second time - similar to the Red Weddding it's one of those things where you're anticipating a moment at the very end so I didn't immerse myself in the rest of the episode as much as usual in my initial view.
Â 
Also forgot the mention - Bran's scene - really loved it especially the set of the weirwood which was beautiful.. I'm guessing it's safe to assume the dragon he saw over KL was in the past not in the future (not to say it won't happen in the future) but it's meant to be ambiguous.

1622	Widows_Blood	2014-04-14	I blame GRRM for Stannis story on the Show not D&D. Coming into season 3 I really dreaded the entire Dragonstone arc. I mean in the books we get nothing but Davos in prison for a few chapters than a few post prison chapters and then basically nothing until the end of ASoS. There's really not a ton of material to adapt; hence trying to create some drama in Dragonstone with Stannis becoming overly reliant on Melissandre. I don't get the furor here, I really don't. Stannis clearly isn't enjoying burning the Florents, but is putting up with Melissandre because he feels her powers is his only hope towards winning the throne. He has no army, navy or support at this moment. He's relying on Mel because its all he has. It's painfully obvious that Stannis will move more towards Davos once his storyline starts to get some forward momentum. I think when Stannis gets to the wall we will start to see more of his book persona. Of course in the meantime I will amuse myself with the consistent cries of character assassination from the usual reactionaries on this forum.Â
1623	The hairy bear	2014-04-14	Another 8 here. Very good, but not excepcional. They could have done more with the Stannis's scenes, Bran's dream, and Cersei's confrontation with Brienne and Pycelle.
1624	DolorousKim	2014-04-14	I rated this a solid 8.Â  To me, it was just a shade less enjoyable than last week's episode, but still a consistently engaging and entertaining foray into the saga.Â  Also, as a book reader, it's quite possible that I have some unrealistically high expectations that the "big event" episodes can't usually live up toÂ  when compared with the literary unfolding of events.Â  The lone exception to this in my mind is the "Blackwater" episode, which might possibly have been even stronger than what was portrayed in the book.
Â 
That being said, there were some highlights that jumped out at me in this episode:
Â 
Tyrion and Jaime dining scene - I really enjoy whenever Peter Dinklage and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau get to play off each other.Â  Tyrion is the only person that Jaime feels he can confide in, and I like the little brother bolstering bigger brother interplay here.Â  Tyrion and Jaime's good qualities never shine better than when they are consoling each other.
Bronn and Jaime sparring - More Bronn is always a good thing in my books, and I love the nonchalant and effortless way that he gets under Jaime's skin.Â  Sir Bronn truly gives no f***'s as to who he pisses off.Â  Jerome Flynn seems like he's having a ball playing the swaggering sellsword.
Oberyn/Ellaria vs. Tywin/Cersei - House Martell comes off with the win in this smoking little tete a tete.Â  The great casting for the roles of the Red Viper and his paramour points to the many great things yet to come in this season.
Tyrion vs. Joffrey wedding scenes - The malevolence between these two fairly crackles right through the screen without ever being over the top.Â  A fine acting workshop courtesy of Dinklage and Gleeson.
The death of King Joffrey - Massive kudos to Jack Gleeson for making Joffrey such an epically loathsome little shit right up to the end.Â  I'm so going to miss hating on the creepy bugger.....
Â 
The parts I found kind of meh:
Â 
The Dragonstone scenes - I found them to be underwhelming and a bit forced into this episode, and I'm still not digging Stannis' charaterization in the show.Â  Stephen Dillane and Liam Cunningham's talents are pretty much wasted in this episode.Â  Kerry Ingram is really impressing me as to how good an actress she is, however, so there is that for a bright spot.
Ramsay's "hunt" - Yeah, yeah, we get it, Ramsay is a sadistic prick.Â  I think the Theon torture-porn pretty much drove that point home at ridiculous length last season.Â  I could have done without this scene, even though it wasn't that long, and wasn't as graphic as it could have been.
The head-scratching scenes:
Â 
What exactly happened to Shae?Â  Without treading into Spoiler country, I really doubt that she's on a boat to Pentos, so what's up?Â  Why did they make a point of showing Bronn escorting her presumably out of the Red Keep, and why did she slap Bronn when Tyrion sent her away?Â  Something is definitely going on, and I really can't tell what it is......
1625	aFeastForDragons	2014-04-14	I really expected more from the Jamie/Tyrion scene. I've been looking forward to their interaction for a year but Jaimie just sat back and said barely anything. Hopefully we get another few interactions before the "moon boy" interaction.Â
1626	rmholt	2014-04-14	9.9 Demerit for Cersei-Brienne. Also a proper Reek wouldn't have turned a hair at mention of Robb.
1627	Ran	2014-04-14	367 votes in, it's averaging a 8.4. Normalized (top/bottom 5% removed) it's at 8.55.
1628	RadoLukacs	2014-04-14	10/10.
Â 
This was just mind-blowing. I particularly enjoyed the epic ending, the acting was terrific, most of all Lena Heady. The Rains of Castamere played by Sigur RA3s during the end-credits was a great choice. The costumes, sets, actors in this episode were great. There wasn't a single bad or unnecessary scene, I think. Alfie Allen is incredible and I like what they are doing with Selyse. Also I am glad that they kept Moat Cailin in the show. The wedding itself was done beautifully - scenes of individual characters were very well-done and I greatly enjoyed the tension between Joffrey and Tyrion, as well as Sansa's unbelievably sad moment (when that slow music started playing and all the people were laughing at the Young Wolf). The death itself was shocking and tense, and what is more - it may be that their decision not to explicitly show the poisoner is rather good for the TV format. Brilliant!
Â 
This episode was amazing, I think George R. R. Martin and Alex Graves have done a perfect job. The actors' performances are unrepeatable. This season seems to be the best so far. Even though I pictured the whole wedding differently in my mind while reading it, I think this episode did it justice and we can expect quality for the rest of the season.
Â 
Â 
Episodes 1 and 2:Â Â  7;10/10.
1629	rainsofcastamere_	2014-04-14	I've been waiting all this time to see that little shit of Joffrey going down and now I'mÂ kind of sad that we're not gonnaÂ see anymore of Jack Gleeson's amazing acting. He did a great job with the purple wedding, any scene with him was brilliant. I liked how Sansa was helping Tyrion, and her non-verbal act was nice, as someone mentioned before. That being said, I was sort of disappointed with Lena's scene, I don't know, I guess I expected to be more dramatic, she wasÂ all like "Aaaah Tyrion did this, get him" and that was it. Though I liked the rest of her scenes, with Oberyn and Brienne. And damn, I wouldn't complain if we got more Oberyn scenes
Â 
Anyway the onlyÂ thing that bothers me and kind of creeps me out, after this episode, is that Roose Bolton's beard is getting longer and longer... dafuq is that? 
Also thatÂ eyebrow-twitching while talking with Ramsey about Reek was just ridiculousÂ and so not ...Boltonish. I think Mike Mcelhatton can do better than that. But all in all I liked that they put that Bolton father and son conversation, I hope we're gonna see more of that, I almost felt sorry for Ramsey. Almost.
And that shaving thing with Ramsey and Reek was a nice touch
1630	Shadowflame	2014-04-14	I give it a 7.Â  I think I enjoyed the books so much that the tv show leaves the story lacking.Â  I thought the Roose/Ramsey/Theon scene was really good and I like the Bran flashes when he touched the tree.Â  Jack Gleeson's portrayal of Joffrey is spot on. He will be missed.Â  I like the Fat Walda scene and I like the actor who plays Locke/Vargo Hoat.
1631	ovis alba	2014-04-14	Â 
What exactly happened to Shae?Â  Without treading into Spoiler country, I really doubt that she's on a boat to Pentos, so what's up?Â  Why did they make a point of showing Bronn escorting her presumably out of the Red Keep, and why did she slap Bronn when Tyrion sent her away?Â  Something is definitely going on, and I really can't tell what it is......
Â 


Â 
I actually do have a suspicion how i will turn out, but I do have to tread into Spoiler country for it:
Â 

	Spoiler  As Bronn is a Sellsword after all and basically the only person that can probably pay way better than Tyrion is Tywin, they might have Bronn sell Shae to Tywin so she will testify against Tyrion, making not only Shae but also Bronn betray Tyrion, which would also perfectly explain why Oberyn will be the one fighting for him

1632	Miss Carnahan	2014-04-14	Gave it a 6. It was marginally better than 401. The stannis scenes were quite boring and useless, to my regret. Didn't like the whole Shae situation. The wedding was good, but could have been better. Of course was the entire experience yet again seen from Tyrion's POV, while the wedding is in fact Sansa's chapter in ASOS. Alas, she only had one line during the entire episode. However, no Dany, so that was good!Â  + The scenes between Joff and Tyrion were super intense. (going to miss Jack and even Joff a lot) Oh, the scene between Ramsay and Roose were quite good as well, with Roose of course being perfectly intimidating (and handsome may I add) again.
1633	Dildo_Baggins	2014-04-14	6..i expected the wedding to be more epic. Still that last scene made up for it. I kinda felt a little bad for his horrible fate , the way he turned purple and his nose bled.

1635	Impish	2014-04-14	she has utterly failed to express the panic of a mother losing her child. Denial is the first stage of grief, as Michelle skipped straight to step 4, depression, Lena skipped to step : 2 anger, but nonetheless she failed to express step 1, denial. Making the whole rendition not credible, fake and plastic.


Â 
Â 
Rubbish.
Â 
TheÂ KA1bler-Ross "Five Stages of Grief" model you're attempting to invoke here, does NOT require all the stages to be present, or even for them to occur in any specific order.
Â 
"Elisabeth KA1bler-Ross noted that the stages are not meant to be a complete list of all possible emotions that could be felt, and they can occur in any order. Her hypothesis holds that not everyone who experiences a life-threatening or life-altering event feels all five of the responses, due to reactions of personal losses differing between people."
Â 
http://en.wikipedia....bler-Ross_model
Â 
Â 
Insisting that all portrayals of grief must robotically proceed through all five stages in order, to be "credible" is about the most ridiculous criticism I've ever read.

1636	jarl the climber	2014-04-14	I gave it an eight. Joffreys death was the highlight of the episode. I think they should have set up the Sansa/Ser Dontos storyline a little bit better. I thought it was odd that Brienne never spoke to Sansa. I would have liked it if we had gotten the reveal about the Valyrian dagger as well. I'd have preferred it if Stannis had killed Lord Florent for the same reason as he did in the book. I liked Oberyns thinly veiled threat to Lord Tywin. I thought Tywin should have called Joffrey out on some of his actions, his staying quiet seemed out of character. In the books, the wedding sort of rehabilatated Renlys image, he was Marges husband, and publicly mocking him would have been beyond the pale. I could nitpick all day long but it was a solid episode overall despite some of the shortcomings.
1637	kakoserrano	2014-04-14	7
Â 
Good things:
-Â Olenna: This marriage was her show from start to finish and they got it right from top to botton.
- Stannis: I did like his bit and for me he was very unconfortable seeing that burning people crap.
- Bolton: Great actor and good scene, he is the creepy one
- Purple: I really liked the special effects in the death scene. It replaced the book death in a good way.
Â 
Bad things:
- Cercei reaction: This almost killed the moment for me. I believe it was important and a turning point to the character to suffer terribly with her son's death, but she just turns from suffering to rage very quickly (bad editing?). Ok, she is bad to the bone, but she loved Jeoff.
- Bran: Hate this Bran shit in the Show and in the books. I really don't care for visions, dreams, warging, all this crap.
- Ramsay: I don't really like the way they are portraing him. He looks like a incapable demented person, not someone that Bolton would put in charge of anything.
Â 
That's it, I guess. Sorry for my uninglish.
1638	Drogon's Personal Trainer	2014-04-14	Enjoyed this immensely and gave it a 9. Â I knocked one point off for the Bran scene. Â Awesome as it was for we in the know, I think it may have been a wee bit confusing to the Unsullied. Â And may the Old Gods forgive me, I know it was poor taste, but I couldn't help but giggle at the Renly and Stannis dwarves. Â Renly riding Ser Loras, Stannis riding Melisandre. Â I'm ashamed of myself, but I chuckled. Â 
Â 
I was also a bit confused when Bronn assured Tyrion that Shae had got on the ship. Â I'm assuming it is NOT the last we see of her - it would be disappointing if so.
Â 
I notice that some book readers have mentioned that no stone was taken from Sansa's necklace, but it clearly was. Â I've watched twice now, and it is definitely the stone that was resting on the collar/left-hand side of her neckline that is missing. Â Over on the Guardian blog (in the UK) a few Unsullied picked this up, so the mystery was perhaps not as cleverly set up as some seem to think. Â But then again, that may be because we know what we're looking for, and the Unsullied there are too used to seeing detective dramas over here.
Â 
There were some outstanding performances tonight, many of them without dialogue. Â The looks on the faces of the Viper, Varys, Olenna, Sansa and Tyrion at the wedding were priceless. Â And Alfie Allen continues to make me sympathise with Theon when I loathed him in the books.  Â
1639	WTFSalami	2014-04-14	8 for me. Not as good as the premiere, but damn good fun. I feel for the ones who can't separate the show from the books, because this is such entertaining television. I can't imagine what it must feel like to sit there and be mad at your TV for an hour every Sunday when this is on. Ugh. 
I do think that the show could greatly benefit from following the example Martin set with Feast and Dance, and the episodes should be split up by region/interconnecting storylines. 
The Dreadfort and Dragonstone stuff just didn't flow with the King's Landing stuff. It was literally like watching 2 different shows. 
The wedding was so colorful and some Dany sprinkled in would have fit much better with the aesthetic and the flow of the episode. 
I feel like the show should be trying as hard as they can to keep the Dreadfort, The Wall, and Bran storylines together, and the King's Landing and Daenerys storylines together, with Stannis sprinkled throughout when the theme syncs up. 
We've got 2 competing tones/color aesthetics going on in the show right now and it feels awkward when they're mixed up. Obviously you couldn't stick slavishly to this formula, but I think it could help the flow better.
1640	WTFSalami	2014-04-14	I see a lot of people docking points for the Bran scene because it was "confusing for the Unsullied." It's supposed to be.Â 
Â 
His chapters around this time were confusing to those of us that read the book, but I don't see why that is all of a sudden a problem now while watching the show.Â 
Â 
All of my Unsullied pretty much had the exact same reaction to that scene: "Holy shit, Bran is FINALLY interesting, wtf was that?"
1641	Sarah the Terror	2014-04-14	I seriously give it a 2.
1642	Phaing	2014-04-14	10.
Why?
Â 
He's DEAD!
Â 
 
Â 
At last!
The right one got killed for a change, and it was nasty.
Â 
I give Sansa full credit, and good for her.
Makes me hope she and Arya get reunited, and can chat about the notches in their belts someday.
1643	ground_control	2014-04-15	8 of 10 -- Solid effort, but nothing spectacular
Â 
A few disappointments:
Â 
o Stannis burning Ser Axel as an "infidel" who refused Stannis's command to tear down idols...I don't think this is as "fanatical" as most people seem to think, it seems Stannis is justifying it because of disobedience to a Royal Command, not a general religious persecution, but saying, "He was caught trying to negotiate a marriage between Shireen and Tommen without my leave" would have taken as much screen time and been true to the book.
Â 
o I missed Tyrion telling Joff that he [Joff] was the only person he [Tyrion] could beat -- as with the Stannis change, it doesn't make the show bad, but it doesn't improve the show, so basically it's different just to be different.
Â 
o Shae was painfully stupid, and I feel the time spent on her scene(s) was a waste (but I feel that way about pretty much every second that gets wasted on her "expanded" role)
Â 
o Roose/Ramsey was a bit weak (I know it can still come later, but "Don't make me rue the day I raped your mother" would have made this scene a bit stronger
Â 
o Brienne's scenes were nice, but awkward (she didn't have to deny being a Lady to make it clear she was awkward being considered as one) -- still, as far as changes to the book goes, I don't think the Jamie/Brienne arriving early is being done that badly overall, and I do understand that a tv show has to give actors more consistent screen time than a book's author does
1644	eyeheartsansa	2014-04-15	9.. I pretty much loved everything but thought Tyrion could have been a little drunker.
1645	chicagostatecougars	2014-04-15	I give it a 5. Stannis butchery continues but there was no Daenerys...so I look at the bright side.


Â 
This exactly. Only saving graces for me were Joffrey's death and no scenes of the Targ girl depicted as some Christ figure.
1646	Holymoly	2014-04-15	I feel that the breadth of narrative being attempted in this series means the shows are reduced to series of vignettes with no sense of flow to the story. For instance the original relationship between Tyrion and Bronn had some substance whereas now they are reduced to charicatures. Based on the literary output of George Martin the producers could have taken the decision to spread the books out over more series as, at this rate,Â they are clearly going to catch up with the books prior to the conclusion of the written original.
1647	Conchobar	2014-04-15	The Bran scene and Ramsay scene were two of the highlights for me actually. Bran's story is leading to something very important in the books and the show. He is going to be more powerful than everyone in the story eventually.
1648	mrlukeduke	2014-04-15	Didn't like most of it. Hammy acting, lines and sequences felt rushed. I have no idea what's going on with Ramsay's new sidekick. Feminist lobby maybe?! Also, Theon does NOT look like a traumatised mind-raped torture victim, he looks like a good-looking guy in makeup who's "a bit scared". Didn't get the dinner scene with Mel/Stannis/Selyse either. (Had to chuckle at Stannis' line, when he said not to strike his daughter, but he's just come back from burning people alive!)
Â 
Having said that, all the Lannisters were superb. Oberyn does very well with the crap scenes he gets (episode 1, in a brothel, wth?!). The costume and set design is just... unparalleled. Beautifully done. The final scene I enjoyed, although they really drew it out in an obvious way. Actor that plays Stannis is brilliant, again given the crap scenes he gets.
Â 
Basically my main criticisms of the show as a whole have all come down to one or two things: it feels rushed and/or not subtle enough, i.e. they're trying to appeal to too large an audience but at the expenses of integrity (but look at a show like Deadwood or Breaking Bad, they were successful but kept their consistency, characters, plot depth and overall integrity in tact).
1649	mrlukeduke	2014-04-15	Oh! Forgot to add: while I don't like any of the build-up scenes with the Reeds (annoying, inexplicable characters IMO), the whole weirwood green dream sequence was truly amazing. Kinda blew me away actually, almost spot on as far as what I had imagined from reading all the books. It was a bit like Frodo's ring-visions.
Â 
I watched it back and there are tons of little clues, whispers, book references and so on. I also like how they hinted that Bran might be the "promised prince" (where book readers know where that whole thing is going...). But sorry, I don't like the Reeds' given dialogue, it's too corny, i.e. any of the scenes where Bran is "awake" with them. It all seems rushed and over-staged with obviously "derp derp" lines.
Â 
When he's a dire wolf or in vision states it's cool. Also he was great with Rickon, but something about his new adventure seems a bit hammy.

1650	Mithras	2014-04-15	This one was perfect. The touch of GRRM was visible for me. It gave me the same pleasure as reading the books.
1651	Wsaharan	2014-04-15	Gave it a 6. Was quite disapointed with the Purple Wedding. Even though the expectations were a bit high.
Â 
The deathscene worked better the second time I watched it (just like Cat's in the RW), but it still felt rushed, like most of the episode.
Â 
It feels like everyone have to interact with everyone, and all this constant jabbing back-and-forth often felt pointless.
Â 
There used to be sparks flying between Tyrion and his fucked up nephew, but now there was nothing, no intensity, nothing. Just a lot of frowning. That disapointed me the most.
Â 
The best scenes where the breakfast with the Lannister boys hanging out, there are so few genuinely nice scenes like this anymore in the series now that all the Starks are either dead or deranged. Also I loved the Bolton&Bastard ones, especially with the Reek shave. Now that Gleeson is gone, I will move my focus and admiration to Allen. He's perfect.
1652	Grand Maester Mithrandir	2014-04-15	Straight 7 from me. The opening scene was good, showed just how twisted Ramsey is, but who exactly is that girl he was with?
The scene with Cersei, Tywin and Oberyn & Ellaria was wonderful, probably my favourite, Pedro Pascal makes more & more sense each time I see him.
The wedding scenes were okay, I just felt like wasn't as joyous and lively as in the books. The ending of course was wonderfully done.

Well, Bran's story changed a lot in the last book and the show is just starting with it. To be honest I also had my times when everytime I turned the page and saw a Bran on top of it, it was a "*sigh* not him again, can we rather get back to someone interesting", it changed a lot though and now he's one of the characters I most look forward to. (Dany sort of now has the "honor" of the *sigh*, although the last chapter of her also finally helped a little with that  )

Â 
Yeah, I love Bran's story - a side dish that fills out the main feast.
Â 
However I don't really like how the Reeds are portrayed. They just seem a bit 'off the mark'
Â 
On topic. 7.5 but rounded down to 7.
Â 
I can understand why people might be wondering what on Earth the Ramsay hunt scene was about.
I really liked the Dreadfort scene with the introduction of Fat Walda and the whole 'shave me Reek' set up. It showed a lot of things not least of which is Ramsay isn't going to sit back and be just a bastard.
To me it was clear that Stannis only allowed the burning to appease certain others and isn't a 'true believer', but rationalising it with 'he didn't follow my orders' was a bit soft. I did rate "She is my daughter you will not beat her".
Jaime/Tyrion was good as was Jaime/Bronn.
They missed the mark with Joffrey not saying 'I am experienced with Valyrian steel' and the connection to the attempt on Bran's life. Dunno how they will resolve that now.
Wedding looked good but the words used for every wedding is different in the show. The strip of cloth is the only connecting image between marriages on this show.
Tyrion/Shae - motion hand cam worked well. I don't actually mind Sibel's acting.... but it has suffered from being made into a love story.
Feast - Initially I thought it was too choppy, but on rewatch it was much better. Loras getting a personality is great. War of 5 Kings was great. Joff being a d-bag was great. Jewel handling great. Oberyn was great. Dormer nailed what I had in mind as Marg from the books. Brienne's greeting at the High Table just did not fit in at all. It was painfully obvious that it was cobbled on. "We have this character who is a fan favourite, so lets get her to do something - except the obvious thing which isÂ talk to Sansa.'
Joff's death - Jack was fantastic, Make up and CGI were suitably and satisfyingly gruesome.... but I just wasn't convinced by Lena Headey.
I actually really wish I hadn't read the books before seeing this episode, I suspect I might have given it a couple more points if that had been the case.

1658	Talking Hodor	2014-04-15	It was a really good episode, but I don't think they captured the sheer hatred between Joffrey and Tyrion as well as the book did.Â  Some of the 'insults' Tyrion launched at Joffrey were a bit abstract and not nearly as good as Tyrion is capable of, especially TV Tyrion.
1659	Talking Hodor	2014-04-15	Then again, Bran getting hodored back to reality was pretty sweet!
1660	gogorath	2014-04-15	Love the King's Landing stuff -- the writing and execution to set up the Murder Mystery was great. The evidence is all there but not super obvious (although so many book readers ran to the internet to post screen shots pretending they saw this real time with no help, no one is likely unspoiled at this point). Almost every character had their motive highlighted.
Â 
The rest of the episode was really "leftovers from episode 1." There may have been some loose ties to Joffrey, but overall, to be a 10, it needed to be a bit more cohesive and be equally strong across the board. A 9, though -- the death was fantastic.
1661	gogorath	2014-04-15	That's a strecth. Everyone who's butthurt over Stannis needs to calm down and wait for episode 9.


Â 
Yeah, I don't understand people's thing with Stannis. Someone claimed whitewashing (you keep using that word; I do not think it means what you think it means) and others are outraged because he watched the burnings.
Â 
He showed no particular religious fervor or joy in the burnings; that was Selyse. Book-Stannis is someone with little use for religion that doesn't advance his goals; but I fail to see how Show-Stannis is different. Book-Stannis is lawyerly in his ability to pretend to be following a strict code which seemingly morphs at will to what he truly wants. Again, Show-Stannis seems to be going along with this part of Melisandre because he wants to be King. What's different?
1662	AndrA©s Garcia	2014-04-15	I gave the last episode an eight and I gave this one a seven. My hatred for Joffrey isn't so great that his death overshadows all the flaws in the episode. There are many small things that I loved though---e.g. the look of understanding on Oberyn's face when he saw Sansa's grief and humiliation during the jousting, Olenna Tyrell's subtle reaction as Tyrion lifts up Joffrey's cup and brings it to him, Cersei's questioning of Brienne, etcetera.

1664	Fevre River Warrior	2014-04-15	I loved it. I have been waiting to watch the end of the Purple Wedding on the screen since I first read it.
Â 
1) Loved Bran and the tree.
2) Not sure where they are going with Mel and Shireen....I hope she does not do anyting to that wonderful little girl (kings blood and all.....) unless she "cures' the gray scale.
3) Theon/Reek is so sad to see. I hope Yara/Asha gets to him soon
4) Liked the necklace replacing the hair net for Sansa. The Queen of Thornes was fussing with it and the goblet was in front of her later.....we know the rest.
5) Oberyn staring down Tywin was fabulous.
6) That awful, disgusting Joffrey is GONE!!!!!
Â 
Give me more!!!!! Sunday can't come soon enough....
Â 
PS: Wow, Fat Walda is REALLY fat! She seems sweet, like in the book. Felt sorry for the horse.

1665	Inevittable	2014-04-15	I've given it an 8.
Â 
The wedding was gorgeous, and seemed much grander than the description in the books. Â Because I pictured it to be in a big hall it seemed a bit drab in my imagination.
Â 
I liked the character interactions during the wedding, and the little moment where Joffrey surprises Tyrion with his thanks for the book. I actually LOLed at Loras's comeback to Jaime ("neither will you"). Â 
Â 
I thought Margaery was excellent, you can see how crafty she is, and it seems a lot more deliberate than it does in the books. Â I'm actually starting to root for her.
Â 
The building tension between Tyrion and Joffrey was very well done, and Sansa's reaction to the dwarfs was excellently done - as was the smattering of clues before the choking.
Â 
I didn't really pay attention to much except the wedding, as you can see. Â 
Â 
It could have been a 10 if the events hadn't been so slow though. Â I thought the whole episode was a tad plodding, and the Tyrion/Shae interaction didn't do much for me.
1666	clairep12	2014-04-15	I gave it an 8, almost a 9. I am so glad joffrey is dead, he was a great character but man did he drive me crazy. The way in which the wedding scenes played out was good, i liked the very subtle hints as to who is behind joffreys death. Below is a clip of the kings final moment. Good riddance!!
Â 
http://connectv.com/vs/18242/happy-wedding-joffrey/Â
1667	Daedric Justice	2014-04-15	7/10. It had some great moments but too much flab imo.
1668	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-15	8/10
Â 
Joffrey turning purple was a very mesmerizing scene, disturbing to the point where I almost forgot to be happy. Then followed by the Sigur Vos version of 'Rains of Castamere' in the end credits was haunting. They've turned the sadistic Lannister song into their lament with a 'Karma bitch' vibe to it.
Â 
The characterÂ reactions to the mockery of the Kings was amazing! I especially loved how Oberyn was spotted amongst the clapping crowd looking pretty sick with the whole thing-clearly establishing him as a decent/good guy.
Â 
"And neither will you"- Thank You! I was getting tired of Loras sitting around being the gay joke constantly. ThatÂ comment was a fist pump moment and made me lol pretty hard.
Â 
Sophie was fantastic despite having no verbal scenes.Â  The Starks have suffered so much and their situation is heart-breaking/unbearable....yet, the Starks endure...and Sansa really showed that in her reactions. Last week I was very disappointed with Jon acknowledging Robb's death sceneÂ (seemed less bothered than Theon) so I'm hoping Locke will encounter Jon and be the target of some vent up frustrations. I need to know Jon cares about what happened to his family!!
Â 
My main beefs with the episode was Stannis being a religious tyrant (my unsullied friend thinks he is the bad guy!). Also, I imagined Cersei's reaction to Joff dying being more raw and heartfelt but it seemed a little rushed. That being said I did love Jaime running to his son shouting 'Joffrey' rather than 'Your grace' even if it wasn't something he would do in the books. I almost wish they had changed it to Jaime saying 'My son' so JoffreyÂ would haveÂ died in more shock/agony knowing the rumoursÂ were true, haha. Â

1669	flamingothegreen	2014-04-15	I was really excited to see this episode. I haven't read the books yet, but I've read more spoilers than I can account for. Somehow, I'm not 100% satisfied so I rated the episode an 8.
Â 
What I liked: 
- the scenes with Ramsay. Well, I didn't really enjoy them, but I do like seeing how much of a complete sociopath he is. I pity Theon so much as well - he did wrong, but no one deserves what he got. Not even Joffrey. I thought it added a good amount of development to Ramsay, Roose and Theon though as well, and a bit of insight to their mindsets and morals and such. Good stuff!
- the little bit with Bran was awesome (especially the Hodor bit LOL), though I wish we'd have seen more. I've been really impressed with Bran's development as a character (didn't read many spoilers for him since I didn't think much of him originally). Can't wait to see where it's going. c:
- everything after the dwarf sceneÂ - Joffrey and Tyrion's back-and-forth, the chalice going aroundÂ  (especially when Sansa picked it up! Clever doing that, and I like the idea of Sansa softening up to Tyrion).
- Joffrey's death! At the same time, I didn't enjoy it. I thought I'd be happy, but I wasn't. Joffrey's presence will be missed. 
- the dwarves! Well, not something enjoyable of course, but it's a good reminder of how cruel Joffrey is. 
- the back-and-forth between Oberyn, Ellaria, Tywin, and Cersei - great dialogue, and I do love when they insult Cersei. c: I already liked Oberyn from "Two Swords" but was unsure about EllariaÂ - I definitely like her personalityÂ nowÂ though. 
- the wedding itself. Everything was gorgeous. 
Â 
Â 
What I didn't like:
- it's already been said, but I think some of the scenes were a bit rushed. The Bran and Stannis ones in particular, I believe. I'll have to go back and rewatch those scenes to analyze them appropriately since I don't remember them as well as I should. 
- Cersei's reaction to Joff's death. It started off well but she was so quick to lay the blame on Tyrion, that I didn't even feel sad for her losing her son. I think that's perhaps why I wasn't satisfied with the death of Joffrey. The emotion just wasn't strong enough to be relatable.
- Loras/Oberyn stares. I know the Martells and Tyrells aren't supposed to be on the best terms and that Loras was always loyal to Renly, so the suggestion is somewhat bothersome. 
Â 
Overall, I enjoyed it but it could have been executed better.

1670	LordElrond	2014-04-16	I think generally, it was a good episode. Of course, Jack Gleeson's performance really did it for me. On the other hand, I expected more of Cersei. In the book, she really loses it, but in this episode, it seemed like she got over it rather quickly and moved her attention to revenge from Tyrion.
Â 
I also don't know how I feel about the way they're shaping Shae's story. but again, overall I was really happy to how they did the wedding and the incredible attention to detail.Â
1671	Beric175	2014-04-16	This was a great episode. 9/10 from me. If I had a problem it would be the Stannis scenes, only because they did not add much beyond mentioning the Great Other and establishing a love-hate relationship between Selyse and Shireen. The actors are well-portraying what they've been given but judging from what D&D have been saying about Stannis in the most recent Inside the Episode video, I think the problem with theÂ Stannis characterization seems to stem largely from the fact that Weiss has a less nuanced position regarding Stannis than Benioff and that is crucially the problem with the characterÂ itself: he's a divisive character (some people think he's a kinslayer for having Renly murdered byÂ shadow, others think he's got the ONLY legal claim when Daenerys also has a good birth right).Â I mean people reading the books have disagreed about the character, so why wouldn't that potentially be the case with the creators of the show? It's unfortunate that Weiss wants to portray him in a way that is more akin to a religious zealot than anything else, whereas bA©nioff seems to understand that melisandre is just a means to an end and some of that comes through with the actor's portrayal of the character in this episode to me because he seems disinterested in whatever religious procedure melisandre as going on and he at least says "hands off my daughter" so yeah, the complexity off the show version of the character has to be found elsewhere than in his speeches about claims and thrones. I can live with this portrayal of Stannis because I believe the intent is to have him turning up at the Wall as a hero in the last two episodes be a surprise despite the fact that they've established this motivation at the end of last season. A bit ofÂ  a shame that the creators are not on the same page about him, but then again, many of the readers aren't. At least Shirreen and Davos are true to their book counterparts. I can live with the show version of Stannis for the sake of simplification and narrative economy.
Â 
The rest of the episode was amazingly well-done and kudos to jack Gleeson who has been as good as anyone cpould have hoped for in that hateful role and I'm really liking Iwan Rheon's portrayal of Ramsay as well so here's to the psyhcos of Westeros. may both of them rest in pieces once the story's over.Â Alfie Allen should really get some recognition for his portrayal of Reek/Theon and now that we have the physical torture behind us it will be interesting to see where he goes rom here and Roose Bolton is also wonderful on the show. Really, all these serial killers of Westeros need is to hug their dads . "Who the f***'s Jon Snow?" made me laugh. Locke is one of the better inventions for the show methinks. Bran's story is also getting interesting and it's nice to see them bringing in material from when we first met the Reeds in the books. I think most of Bran's storyline in the books is not that eventful that chronology is strictly required, which could be an asset going forward, as they are inevitably going to have to do something with Bran once they run out of ADWD material so yeah, why not introduce elements from earlier books later on? Well-done. I also like the consistency of the visions because it shows that they have a clear endgoal and that we'll get there sooner rather than later.Â 
Â 
I see where the divide usually comes from regarding Lena Headey's portrayal of Cersei because when Martin writes her we get full-on idiot/asshole Cersei, not just deeply condescending/cynical Cersei and it's refreshing to see Lena portray that hatefulness and schadenfreude so well here.Â I don't have a problem how they usually show Cersei, it's just that viewers might hate her for slightly different reasons in the show than in the books but I can live with that. That scene with Pycelle was hilarious. They're really setting up her disappointment with him so once he gets to be in charge for a while he'll gloat and be sufficiently arrogant, which is always good. Tywin and Olenna are both awesome as matriarch and patriarch of their families, albeit Olenna is deliberately telling tywin to enjoy himself of course so as to make him let his guard down for just that second and then...the king's choking on the floor. All the wedding interactions are wonderful (Oberyn/Ellaria are so wonderfully progressive I would not be surprised they end up becoming fan favourites on the show, Jaime's really in no position to threaten anyone, and certainly wouldn't be able to carry out such a threat and it's lovely seeing Loras having a backbone here too, Brienne is wonderfully awkward and yay we got bowing on the show). natalie diormer is really making margaery much more interesting than she ever was to me in theÂ  books and I don't have a problem with Bronn stepping in for Ser Illyn because of, sadly, the actor's health preventing him from carrying on.Â 
Â 
...and then of course, the mighty Jack and Peter having at it in what's probably the best building tension we've had so far on the show (I especially liked how the show managed to get around the animal cruelty charges that a pig and a dog would inevitably have brought with them and made us feel sad for both tyrion and Sansa, whilst also playing a nice game of "follow the cup"Â and if one looks closely, Tywin is eating the pie so for any viewers who might think that it's NOT the wine, there's your answer). Â 
Â 
Now to me at least it feels like every wedding we had so far has its own character and atmosphere so yes, I will always stick with my praise for the show's version of the RW because it now makes it a singular event, just as this PW is. A wonderful send-off that was too good for a character like Joffey to deserve but Jack Gleeson cetainly deserved nothing less and I already miss him. Next week is his last scene (as a corpse) so lets see if he can do anything more to make us hate him.
Â 
NB: Sansa finally has some agency because her decision to leave is still her decision and it shows the beginnings of hopefully great things to come.
1672	Knight of Ashes	2014-04-16	Well, I was gonna give it a six but that close-up of Theon followed immediately by Tyrion eating a sausage deserves a point. 
At the risk of sounding like Ramsay, they should make that a running gag.
But seriously, last season IIRC left off with Tyrion and Cersei having an almost normal brother and sister conversation where Cersei pretty much admitted that it wasn't her but Joffrey who had Mandon Moore try to kill Tyrion; she gave the impression that she didn't approve of this and the both of them were kind of bonding cause they both felt oppressed by Tywin.
I know the tv versions of Cersei and Tyrion have both made threats to each other and have felt hostilities but in light of that scene, the flow felt off to me when TV Cersei became much closer to Book Cersei when she was at Tywin's side conspiring against Tyrion.
1673	The Anti-Targ	2014-04-16	Some nitpicks on the episode, and rather an annoyance that Bronn is Jaime's training partner. Makes Jaime even weaker in intelligence, can't even figure out his own training options. I suppose they are setting things up to somehow have Bronn use that information. Anyway, disappointed that I won't get to hear Ilyn Payne doing his toungeless cackle laugh.
1674	Beric175	2014-04-16	@The Anti-Targ: You won't be hearing nor seeing Ser Illyn on the show again sadly because the actor has terminal cancer andÂ he expected to die already last year but luckily he has not died yet but yeah,Â out of respect they will probably not recast him and hence, it's best to give his role to another character that people already connected with.
Â 
@Knight of Ashes: you seem to be forgetting that in the same scene between Tyriona nd Cersei last season Tyrion mentions how Joffrey could have been smart by using poison to kill him so noone would have known it was him who killed Tyrion, which then now comes back into play because Cersei knows that he voiced such a possibility to murder someone efficiently.Â Also, have you noticed that every time Tyrion asks Cersei about some hideous deeds (the killing of the bastards, Ser Mandon Moore trying to kill him)Â she always goes silent and neither denies nor confirms anything? I like that far more because it leaves some ambiguity for the viewers.Â All the viewers have is Tyrion's assumptions of what happened, no actual evidence or facts to back that up and so why not have the audience led in the wrong direction? Just because Tyrion arrives at one conclusion as a result of her silence, does not mean that he arrives at the right conclusion.
1675	Three sisters	2014-04-16	I give it a 9 because of Tyrion eating the sausage after the Theon shot, the [SPOILER]subtle 'pling' noise when Olenna drops the poisoned stone in the cup (you have to rewatch it to notice)[/SPOILER]Â and the death scene making everybody happy and cheering(exact the opposite of RW).

Wat can kill u so fast ??  u might choke due to suffocation n problem in breathing.but How one can die bleeding through eyes so fast ???
1678	GeorgeIAF	2014-04-16	I gave it a 8/10 , good episode , but it had some dead moments, also didnt like Stannis part.
1679	Floop	2014-04-16	9/10.
Â 
Loved nearly everything about this episode, from the dialogue, to the interactions, to the big events. Came through on everything I expected from the books and the invented show stuff was great. Would have given it a 10, but that would put it on par with an episode like Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things, and that's a pretty difficult standard to meet.
Â 
It didn't take long for this season to get redeemed, in my eyes.
1680	T.C	2014-04-17	9.5, voted 10 though
1681	Lord_Dustin	2014-04-17	I gave the episode a 9/10.
Â 
Individually I really enjoyed all of the locations visited in the episode. Â The scene between Shireen and Melisandre was superbly executed. Â It was great to see Selyse again. Â The material with the Bolton's was equally fantastic. Â 
Â 
I wonder how much consideration is given to where the stories are placed. Â Surely the scenes set at the Dreadfort, Dragonstone and Beyond the Wall would have made for a better fit with the first episode?
Â 
I was very impressed with the direction in the episode. Â The shots panning around the characters at the wedding feast's top table were beautiful. Â
1682	FC_Lymond	2014-04-17	I was disappointed in it.Â 
Â 
I thought the wedding banquet would be grander.Â  The outdoor setting looked like a child's birthday party.Â  The dwarf play was not filmed well.Â 
Â 
I found some of the changes they have done pretty odd.Â  Jaime and Brienne being there doesn't seem to work.Â  And I am not against show changes.Â
1683	yushkevitch	2014-04-17	I admit I'm surprised at how well this episode was received here.
Â 
It felt awkward, uneven, poorly paced and the wedding itself was far short of the extravagance that was shoved down our throats for how many episodes?
Â 
First, everything's going smoothly through the first few scenes and then - bam! - Margaery is being escorted to Joffrey's side. The quickest nuptials in history and then a rather underwhelming (in terms of spectacle) outdoor reception.Â 
Â 
The Tyrion/Shae scene was awkward. Varys brief appearance(s) even more so (what was the look on his face during the reception?). A bunch of confrontations added the drama (Cersei/Brienne and Jamie/Loras being notable but not anything special) but not much else.
Â 
Unfortunately I have a feeling that the rest of this season will be something like this: Plenty of so-so, marginally relevant scenes highlighted with a few epic ones to keep up the interest. It's still early yes, but I predicted this season and next would likely be the low points of the series, so maybe a tad biased but I was genuinely hoping and expecting more.

Â 
If you think back to Season 2, Maester Cressen died quickly - and bleeding from the nose - when he drank the poison intended for Melisandre. Â That too was dropped into wine.
1685	grumdin	2014-04-18	Really, really average. First time in a while where I've watched a GoT episode and come away disapointed. The RW was OTT but Â very well done, the PW was just lame until the very end. Too much Shae, God she's annoying, and the wedding party looked liked something I'd put on for my little one's 5th birthday in the backyard. Where was the enormous celebration that would have cost the equivalent of millions? Just a couple dozen dudes in fancy dress sitting around. The scene with Ramsay chasing down the girl was also crap. All round I gave it a 5...and that's being generous.
1686	Lady cut throat	2014-04-18	I give the episode an 8 because like another commenter, I feel like they should have just kept the whole episode in Kings Landing and to the wedding. At some points it felt really rushed, like they were running out of their 60 minutes but there was some great bits. Joffrey's death was obviously brilliantly done, kudos to Jack Gleeson. I liked the Joffrey/Tyrion scenes, it was so uncomfortable watching him get bullied and humiliated that I was on the verge of watching through my fingers. And I liked the way Oberyn Martell shut down the Lannisters.
1687	Black Wolf Smith	2014-04-19	I think they have gone back and tried to get Stannis storyline back on track, when he should disappear til the last couple ep.
Â 
I think the big story played out well, and got most of the major points across, but they could have done this ep, all about before during and after the wedding, and it could have been a better one.
Â 
Other things took away from the main storyline.

Yeah they 'got him back on track' by having him burn his brother in law for being an infidel? Wtf are they doing to a great character? Hopefully they just leave him the fuck alone and have his arrival at the Wall be a massive surprise. The Onion Knight already set up the move north, there is no need for further interludes except of course that they have to pay contracted actors

I agree - I don't really understand what was gained by having Jamie and Brienne arrive at KL so early? (Other than simplifying NCW's makeup and look.) And I'm not against show changes, either. 
Â 
Seems like it would have worked just as nicely if they had arrived in 4x03.
Â 
Maybe the next episode will make it clearer??
1690	Count Balerion	2014-04-19	I like this episode a good deal better than the first.Â  The dialogue and pacing felt better, somehow.Â  Some
highlights:
Oberyn out-lannistering the Lannisters with the sarcasm not really bothering to conceal itself under the
mock civility.Â  And none of them had a comeback.
The Boltons. Roose may start giving Tywin a run for his money.
Tyrion's confrontations with Joffrey and Shae.Â  Cersei undermining Margaery.
Head-scratchers: was the party really the best place for Tyrion to have a tAate-A -tAate with Bronn about the
woman he is (I presume) trying to protect?
	Spoiler So: did Joffrey not hire the assassin to kill Bran in the show?

1691	Queen Ayras Lord Commander	2014-04-19	Anyone upset with Joff's death doesn't get it. It was supposed to be very anticlimactic. As much as I would have liked to see him roll down the side of a mountain and hit every stone and branch along the way (i.e. Homer Simpson style), only for him to fall into a moat of feces and slowly die while wailing to his mother without success, this was better. 10! Great acting all around. That side shot of Joff laughing with the bent finger and spittle, perfect depiction of excess. Jack Gleason should of been The Wolf of Wallstreet!
1692	Queen Ayras Lord Commander	2014-04-19	About that Count Balerion.........WTF! How was that ignored?
1693	Rashtibram	2014-04-19	I'm really baffled by the fact that this episode seems to have generated such a luke-warm reaction on this site. Many of the popular criticisms I'm reading seem to be either utterly unfounded, especially when one takes the time to re-watch the episode with them in mind, or are the result of extreme and biased book purism. I found this to be easily one of the best episodes the show has done to date, and not just because we finally got to see Joffrey choke and die. As of now, I consider it to be 7th on my scale of best-to-worst GOT episodes, one spot ahead of 'The Wolf and the Lion' and one behind 'Kissed by Fire.'Â 
Â

Â 
This review pretty much sums up what I loved about the Royal Wedding. The slowly escalating tension, the way the murder-mystery aspect was played up by Martin's writing and Graves' superb direction, and the unsettling sense in that final scene â<U+0080><U+0093> so perfectly captured by the cinematography, music, and acting â<U+0080><U+0093> that the balance of power in the show had just been drastically altered beyond any hope of repair. The interactions between the various political figures of KL were all handled excellently as well, from Loras' parting retort to Jaime: "And neither will you" to Olenna sneakily (but noticeably) removing a stone from Sansa's necklace: "To kill a man at a weddingâ<U+0080>¦horrid" to Oberyn's open and uncaring hostility towards Tywin and Cersei: "In other places the rape and murder of women and children is considered distasteful."
Â 
Considering the explosive nature of the second half of the episode, all the supporting arcs really needed to do was avoid major problems and carry the characters/story along in an acceptable way, but IMO most of them went well beyond that. I think I probably could have done without the opening hunt sequence, but it did provide us with an interesting parallel between the two primary psychopaths of the show (I believe this is discussed more thoroughly in the article linked above), and the later scene at the Dreadfort was quite brilliant. I'm interested â<U+0080><U+0093> and a little apprehensive â<U+0080><U+0093> to see where Locke's hunt for the Stark boys is going (Art Parkinson and Natalia Tena didn't film anything for this season, if I'm remembering correctly) but I'm also definitely looking forward to seeing Ramsay and Reek tackle the Siege of Moat Cailin.
Â 
The scenes on Dragonstone were also handled quite well. I particularly liked Stannis' line "I hate a good many things, but I suffer them all the same." I wasn't the only one in my viewing party who was of the opinion that he was talking about the burnings on the beach, as well as his dislike for the taste of fish. Melisandre's talk with Shireen was one of the highlights of the episode, and the transition from her last line about hell to Bran's POV Direwolf experience was sufficiently eerie and intriguing. Bran's visions were also good, although honestly I was expecting that scene to be a bigger deal than it was portrayed as: on the whole, it seemed a little rushed, and I don't think they illustrated clearly enough why Bran suddenly felt the need to go touch a random tree. My Unsullied friends were mostly just confused by the time the camera cut to King's Landing. I do like that they're playing up the dangers of warging for too long, though: I'm hoping we'll get to see more of that before Bloodraven's inevitable appearance.
Â 
Aside from all that, the pre-wedding KL scenes were mostly fine, if not particularly mind-blowing. Jaime/Bronn was predictably good, and Joffrey's petulant cruelty during the breakfast sequence was spot-on. The Shae scene was my biggest issue with the episode when I first watched it, but upon reconsideration I can't really pinpoint my problem: I suppose it felt a little rushed for what must seem, to the viewing Unsullied, like the farewell of a major character and an entire subplot, but when you really think about it it was sufficiently built up and will (hopefully) tie in well with the rest of her material for this season.
Â 
So, overall, a fantastic episode, a lot better than the premiere (and that's saying something). While it wasn't quite momentous enough to earn an eight from me, I rate according to a very harsh scale compared to other posters here, and as such nearly every episode falls somewhere around the five-six-seven mark ('Blackwater' and 'The Rains of Castamere' being the only exceptions, I believe).
Â 
7/10
Â 
Also: my friend returns as one of the Tyrell cousins! She's the one Cersei rescues from Grand Maester Pycelle during the wedding.

1701	The Killer Snark	2014-05-07	I gave it an eight as well. I still haven't changed my mind about it in light of other episodes. Some great stuff, but it required more than one episode to do the Purple Wedding justice, too much build-up was lost in transference from the third novel, and too much time was chewed up into the bargain by some variable non-KL scenes at the start. Also, where did all the money go which Cersei half-bankrupted the kingdom over in order to pay for the feast? The wedding in the novel was a spectacular affair.

1711	AryaSansa	2014-04-15	Judging from the preview of this season, Lord Baelish will have a role - the question is how?Â  He's in the Vale apparently, and since there's nothing going on over there, perhaps he's part of a plot to bring Sansa over there, since he loves her mother so much.
Â 
Also, I don't think we've seen the last of Shae, judging from the preview.Â  Maybe Tywin captures her, and forces her to become his whore?
Â 
So does Margaery end up being queen regent?Â  Or does Cersei become that?Â  Tomnen becomes king, that's for sure..

I am no longer displeased with this episode and think it is great! I apologize for my monday post about the episode. Great job!

1718	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-15	He really leaves some big shoes to fill (I've never really liked Ramsey, I found him tedious and over-the-top, but I'm hoping the show version will grow on me)
Â 
Best line? Shit, that's hard, he was so good, but his dinner scene in s3e1 was hilarious:
Â 
"My mother always hadÂ a penchant for drama.Â Facts become less and less important to her as she grows older. Our lives were never truly in danger."
Â 
One of my all-time favorite villains, to be sure. He'll be missed and so will Jack (ugh, so many good roles you could get in movies, dude!)
1719	MarieAntoinette	2014-04-15	He was awesome at playing the despicable villian. I have throughly enjoyed his portrayal, you just had to hate him. I'll miss hating on Joffrey.

"No."
*shrugs* "Not really relevant then, is it?"
Â 
Jack was fantastic as Joffrey, and I'm certainly going to miss his presence on the show; even if I'm happy his character is finally dead.
1722	Shebara	2014-04-15	He is (not was!!) a fantastic young actor and I hope to see him again on the screen some time!

I dont understand why he would retire?
Surley his GoT success will propel him for a Hollywood role!
He wont find another profession as lucrative thats for sure!
1729	Hippocras	2014-04-15	I think playing a horrible creature character as a first major role has a big downside.
I sincerely hope that he does not give up acting because of Joffrey hate; I am sure he caught the brunt of it.
But he did a fantastic job and needs to know that.

1730	Modesty Lannister	2014-04-15	Jack Gleeson brought depth to Joffrey that goes beyond books. The dying scene was excellent. The best line, imo, was a sparing match with Tywin:
Â 
Joffrey: My father won the war. You were hiding under Casterly Rock.
Â 
I wish Jack Gleeson all the best with his studies and theatre performances in Dublin.
1731	littleRickon	2014-04-15	fantastic actor, and very cool dude judging from the interviews. Wish him the best whatever career he choses.
Â 
For me, he completely owned every scene he was in. Watching him switch between scared child (with Tyrion) and full-of-himself tyrant was a pleasure. No need for words, just a look at him brought out all the hate the character needed.
Â 
another good line: "I'll give him a red smile"
Â 
Question for the ladies: how charming was he when he wooed Sansa. The books paint him as the perfect prince charming when he chooses so, did that come across in those scenes of S1?
1732	mankytoes	2014-04-15	I just loved the way he sat on the Iron Throne, slouched and cocky, so many characters are obsessed with the Throne, treat it with such reverence, and we've got Joff clearly feeling like it's merely his chair, no more than what he deserves.

Â 
I think he'll be fine. Jack seems to have a good head on his shoulders; he knows he played a shit of a character but he's also aware of the overwhelming fan (and critic) appreciation. From the interviews I've seen, his interactions with fans have been very positive.Â 
Â 
Should he return to acting, I'm sure he'll find the reception quite welcoming.Â

1734	Inv1ctus	2014-04-15	Jack Gleeson was freaking awesome, he really transcended the character beyond of that one in the books. To me this was one of the best castings I've seen in a long time, maybe ever. Some people say that it's easier to play a mean, despicable character, while that may be true in some instances, I doubt there are many characters who would evoke so much pure hatred towards them. Which could be done only if everything about the acting was great. Favourite line is probably one of many "I AM the KING!!" half-screams.
1735	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-04-15	I just loved the way he sat on the Iron Throne, slouched and cocky, so many characters are obsessed with the Throne, treat it with such reverence, and we've got Joff clearly feeling like it's merely his chair, no more than what he deserves.


Â 
 
Â 
Â 
He was just absolutely perfect in this role. He owned every moment, even re-watching it last night the little look in his eye as he goes to give Margaery the kiss in the wedding; a look of possession/ownership. Â I'm sure Jack will do well in life and in whatever he chooses to pursue.

1736	BlackTalon	2014-04-15	I saw an interview with him in which he said that acting just ceased to be fun for him. Maybe he simply needs a break ... and maybe he also just needs to realize what the employment chances (and the wages) are for somebody with a degree in Theology and Hebrew or whatever strange stuff he is studying.

Â 
Yeah he said it was fun when he was doing it as a hobby, but he just didn't like it as a profession.Â 
Â 
A good way to ease him back in there.
Â 
"Hey Jack, we're doing a bit of a play down the local hall, want to join in mate?"
"Cameras? Oh? Those, nah don't know what they are there for. Just ignore them mate."
1738	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-04-15	"He thought drinking wildfire would turn him into a dragon!! He was wrong..."
I loved the delivery of that line.
1739	The Boar of Gore	2014-04-15	"Isn't it a funny song?"
1740	Salad Days Saan	2014-04-15	He doesn't seem to want to carry on with acting.Â 


Â 
He's left the door open for the distant future, in the last interview snippet of his I read.Â  But for now he's done because he has other interests and other talents he wants to pursue.Â  And that's awesome, because it means he'll never have to take on a project he doesn't want to do because he needs the money or something like that.Â  He'll have a degree and a real life and options.
Â 
If he ever makes a return to acting, it'll be on his terms and it'll be because it's a role he really wants to do for his own sake.Â  Which means he'll be excited about it and do it with his full passion and talent, which as we've seen with King Joffrey is considerable.
Â 
He doesn't seem to like Celebrity Culture very much (and who can blame him?)Â  Maybe his "walking away" is a repudiation of that on top of everything else. Another reason for me to admire and respect his decision.
Â 
"Always leave them wanting more," they say.Â  He's certainly doing that.
Â 
He's also retiring on top of his game, which is also very cool.
1741	Tiggy4Real	2014-04-15	I have such love for that kid. Like Tom Felton was a great Draco Malfoy, but Jack Gleeson's Joffrey took the cake. He's gonna take a break and come back looking like a grown man. Someone is going to hand him a role he wouldn't refuse, and we'll be happy to see him again.Â
1742	Miss Carnahan	2014-04-15	"I was quite busy, Your Grace."
"Busy getting captured."
Â 


Â 
Yes, that's my absolute favorite as well, Jack delivered that line so perfectly. Oh, I will miss Jack so much. He was so perfect at being a little (amusing) shit.
1743	SerJeremiahLouistark	2014-04-15	It's the scene that keeps on giving.  Watching him die, choking, cowardly as always.  Great job making me despise Joffrey even more than I already did.
1744	Blazfemur	2014-04-15	Are you people kidding me?! Jack Gleeson was one of the most amazing portrayals of villainy I've ever seen.
Â 
My favorite line: S03E10:
Â 
Joffrey (To Tywin): "I'm NOT tired!!!"
1745	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-15	We have to understand that he saw acting as a hobby and he landed a role that now is part of the tv history and even pop culture. It was a huge thing for a young man to assimilate and he probably hasn't completely. I wish he reconsiders, though. Either way, he's retiring on top: never in my whole life as a tv junkie, I've seen a character who has been so delightful to hate.
1746	The Giver	2014-04-15	I hope someone makes a video compilation of all his scenes.
1747	Daughter of Death	2014-04-15	he has stated that he's going to retire because he just doesn't find acting his cup of tea anymore. he's been acting since he was 5 and has gotten sick of it..
Â 
favorite "line" ever is that little whine he does when tyrion slaps him. makes my heart flutter with happiness.Â
1748	Greywolf2375	2014-04-15	This may be good for him or it may be bad, but he will be forever Joffrey.
Â 
He brought the vileness, the conceit that is Joffrey Lannister to life.
Â 
You loved to hate him, appreciated the skill it takes to be that evil and not be a caricature of evil that can happen so easily (Victoria on Revenge for example).
Â 
Mr. Gleeson.... 
Â 
you earned it.

1749	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-15	Im actually hella butthurt that Gleeson is retiring from acting. Cuz he would be so amazeballs in a lot of other stuff and a Caligula remake and omgosh...i just am so sad to see all these juicy possibilities get shot down. I mean, i respect his decision and all and hes got a really good reason, but still~~
 
We got a fantastic Joff out of it so im pretty happy with what hes given us. He was best Joff. Best Joff ever. I loved that mannerism he created. You know the one, where hes on the Iron Throne and hes always kinda picking at the arm of it. It had an element of uncertainty in him. One of those little details that adds so much.
1750	Salad Days Saan	2014-04-15	A couple episodes into the show there were two actors I had pegged as the people most likely to be made into stars by this show.
Â 
Maisie Williams and Jack Gleeson.
Â 
The casting on this show has been consistently excellent but they both stood out to me right away as absolute home runs.Â  Great talents with the right look and charisma.
Â 
I'm still holding to my prediction on Williams, of course.Â  But I think Gleeson's performance totally establishes that he could be a star of tomorrow if he wanted to.Â  In light of that I think its even more cool that he is stopping.Â  It's one thing to give up acting if you stink, but he's walking away from something he's great at, because he's got other things on his plate.Â
1751	Salad Days Saan	2014-04-15	Though it would not be unprecedented for a successful child actor to give it up, have a real life and succeed at that, and come back to acting on their own terms many years later...

1754	Berry	2014-04-15	Hands down the best casting in the series I think. I wish him all the best in whatever other career he is interested in pursuing but I really do hope he takes a break and returns to acting later on. He has amazing talent. Love the batshit crazy lines he delivers so well;
Â 
"I AM KING"
"I SAID KNEEL"
"I'M NOT TIRED"
 
Â 
I loved reading about his death but in terms of the show, I loved seeing his over the top psycho performance and am really going to miss seeing both Joff and Jack.
1755	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-15	Even Loki got nervous when Jack screamed "I SAID KNEEL!"

Â 
I'm still holding to my prediction on Williams, of course.Â 

Oh shes gonna be a huge star. Her and Turner both. Williams has a passion for dance and Turner, a passion for fashion. So they have other avenues right away if they choose not to stay full on into acting. I do know Maisie did a short film but i cant remember the name of it.Â 
Im just selfish and wanna see more Gleeson being awesome. /selfishes lol
If he ever comes back, ill be rooting for it.

I was talking about Gleeson, not Joff.Â
1758	direwoofwoof	2014-04-15	Jack was outstanding in this role and I'm actually going to miss him as Joffrey. One of the articles reminded us he was playing a 13 year old boy-king and Jack's portrayal captured the petulance, conceit, insecurity, and mania of this character. When he decides to act again, might I recommend a nice romantic comedy?
1759	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-15	He did an amazing Job with Joffrey and made the character a central dynamic to the show. I actually think I'll miss Joffrey because of his douchebag portrayal of him...there was something sickening, yet comical in the love to hate him feels he created. Jack made the character one of a kind.
Â 
He was certainly one of the best cast choices and actors on the show. I hope he gets into acting again, I'll definitely be watching anything he's in.
1760	Boggsy Cyvasse	2014-04-15	Man, he really did do such a great job as Joff... I listened to his address to the Oxford Union about the psycho-social implications of celebrity culture, blew me away. Really well done. One of those rare people who just has a great head on his shoulders, which is why it's so funny for him to turn around and play such a despicable, concieted, cowardly, entitled prick on television. Really did remind me of a young Malcom Mcdowell kind of thing, Clockwork/Caligula era, now that someone had brought up a Caligula remake.
Â 
My favorite line, just because it's fresh in my memory, is when Joff tell's Tyrion that he will be his cup-bearer, "because you're too cowardly to fight"... Ugh, the disgust, contempt, and disdain he displays in his voice and on his face, is SO vile. Especially when you remember his actions during the Battle of the Blackwater, as Tyrion had just recalled.
Â 
Best wishes, Jack! You did an amazing job. Hope to see you again sometime in the future.
1761	Le Cygne	2014-04-15	He was amazing. He pulled off seemingly effortlessly what was really a very nuanced performance.
1762	El Guapo	2014-04-15	I think my favorite Joffrey scene is from the last episode of the first season when after ordering Ser Ilen to remove Marillion's tongue he stands up, takes off his crown and announces "Well I am finished for the day" and then just walks off with a huge smile on his face (to then go torment Sansa by showing her Ned's head). Â It cracks me up every time i watch it.
1763	Floop	2014-04-16	As the wedding got underway, I had the bat-shit crazy thought that I was actually going to miss Joffrey when he was gone. That's a testament to the actor, because God-knows that character had no redeeming qualities.
Â 
I got a kick out of the way he started injecting a little mirth into the role. The goofy way he would kind of dance around with that smirk on his face when he thought he was being clever was a lot of fun.

1764	George W. Lannister	2014-04-16	I feel giddy about the casting of all of the Lannisters, from top to bottom. Such a great fit! Joff takes the cake, though...
My favorite memory is from S3E1 when he's in his little royalty wagon with the bars on the windows. Just him, sniffing an ether rag and peering out of the bars with a concerned look on his face.

1766	Catherine Storm	2014-04-16	I almost almost felt sorry for poor Joffrey as he lay there dying...Â 
That says something about Jack Gleeson!
Â 
Well done to him for playing such a nasty dude so well, and all the best for him in his future :-)
Hope to see him in films or TV again
1767	Ghosteline	2014-04-16	The look on his face was just absolutely hillarious when Tyrion told him to go and fight instead of him with the dwarves. The long silence and his confused stare was boiling with hate. No words were necessary. He was PISSED OFF! Well done Jack!
1768	Chilli	2014-04-16	Great actor indeed. He played the villain so well, that I found it really fun to look at. That's the difference with Ramsay, I really don't like to see him on screen.
When Joffrey was dying, I was really feeling sad. I never tought I would miss hem, but now I realise I do.

1780	pandagod	2014-04-20	He was excellent and probably one of the best performances we'll see in the show , he would make a perfect Caligula if they ever make a new version, although it would be Joffrey v2.0

You could just tell heÂ  was certain he looked dashing and regal in it.Â  There was no actual awareness of the responsibility of the crown, or the sacrifice a true King may be forced to make.Â  It was just something cool he was entitled to.

All Hail Jack Gleeson!

1790	CaptainTheo	2014-10-23	I thought Jack Gleeson was perfect casting as Joffrey.

I put him in the top ten actors from this season even though he appeared in only three (essentially two) episodes.

No one can hate show Ramsay. But we still have Cersei and Harzoo as well as a plague of freys.
1795	Daughter of Death	2014-04-14	So, I'm curious.Â 
What do you guys think of each of the segments from the vision? There was alot of it!
Â 
I'm loving the hints of winter at King's Landing and the signifigance of the White Walkers. Also of course the dragons at KL.
Â 
Bran's story has always been my favorite so this part of the episode made me all giggly! Well so did the last scene, but that was fun for all of us.
Â 
DISCUSS!
1796	Bron078	2014-04-14	Did we see a glimpse of leaf in the vision? I thought so..
1797	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-04-14	Dany will invade. The White Walkers will invade. King's Landing (and most of Westeros) will become a ruin.
Â 
Not some big revelation but that's what all the visions/dreams so far have been pointing at. It was a really cool scene though.
1798	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-15	Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but I noticed KL appears seemingly intact when that dragon shadow flies over. Maybe Aegon or whoever finally dispatches the Lannisters and Tyrells will do so with a relatively peaceful coup.
Â 
Anyway, that's now twice (twice!) we've seen a destroyed throne room in winter, so I think it's safe to say that's happening for sure
1799	Dragon's Bane	2014-04-15	To be fair, I don't think that the date of those events was specified. There have been dragons over Kings's Landing in the past and the WW aren't new either.
And obviously it trivializes Bran's journey - it seems as if he's now about as skilled as he is in ADWD, being able to get glimpses off changing into trees.
1800	Obebb	2014-04-15	Some of those glimpses were so creepy, like the one of the white walker through the ice or whatever that was, I don't even know. It was so cool.
Â 
I saw someone say something about that snowy throne room possibly symbolizing Jon on the throne, as we are seeing "snow on the throne" Â . Not too sure what I think of that idea, but that would be pretty crafty.
Â 
And to OP, Bran's story is my favourite too!
1801	Konradsmith	2014-04-15	Interestingly almost all of that footage has already appeared in the show. Like Ed Wood they used stock footage, though they used their own of course and to much better effect.
1802	Dustdevil	2014-04-15	I actually tried making a thread on this topic but it hasn't gone up until now. Anyways here's my interpretation of each and every vision except for the last one where BR says "North":
Â 
Crypts of WinterfellÂ -Â Â The first vision we see is that of a heart tree, followed by the TRV flying through the crypts of Winterfell. Directly after that, we see the image Eddard Stark sharpening Ice and the close shot of his eye in the Black Cells of the Red Keep when Varys comes to visit him in season 1. You could simply say that this is repetition of Bran's previous vision in season 1 where he predicts his fathers death, but I think it points to the importance of the crypts of Winterfell. Many here on the forums believe that the Crypts of Winterfell will have some importance in the revealing of Jon's parentage and that something is hidden in Lyanna's crypt specifically. The fact that Eddard is being shown could be hinting towards the fact that he knew something about the crypts and about the secret that he took with him to his grave (Which is that R+L=J).
Â 
The Little Girl - After that vision, we see an image of a girl in robes standing in the woods beyond the wall. In the background we hear a voice, obviously BR, saying that Bran should look for him "beneath the tree". As many pointed out from one of the trailers, this girl could be one of the CotF and in this case, BR is hinting to Bran as to who will help him find him.
Â 
Snow on the Throne and WinterÂ - After this we see a series of visions all dealing with the coming Winter. We see the Other's dead horse from the end of season 2, we see one staring through what looks like a frozen river and we see, once again, Snow on the Iron Throne. There are two ways of interpreting this. On the one hand, you could simply say that BR is trying to show Bran the ultimate outcome if he is to fail in his mission to stop the WW. On the other hand, the fact that they are showing us the same imagery from Dany's vision at the HotU could point towards a stronger meaning of this scene. It could be that this directly points towards Jon Snow's actual parentage. Just like how the first vision could point to it, this vision could mean that snow is of royal heritage. It doesn't necessarily mean that he will sit on the IT or become King, just that he is Rhaegar's son and therefore, the true heir to the IT.
Â 
Bran fallingÂ - This is one of the visions that I loved the most. We see Bran falling down the tower, with Cersei screaming "He saw us!" in the background. Could this possibly point towards Bran regaining his memory of why he fell? How would that have any significance for his story if he finds out why or how he fell, especially if he is to be the next greenseer?
Â 
The Black Dragon over Kings LandingÂ - I'm just going to flat out say it here. I don't think that this is hinting to Dany heading to KL, and that it is just there to put the show watchers off. I think this scene is hinting more to the fact that Aegon will take KL since it only shows the shadow of a dragon looming over it. In the books, we know that "dragons" in prophecies don't have to literally mean dragons but that they could be refering to Targaryens or Blackfyres instead. The fact that it is only the shadow that we see is also interesting:Â It is a black dragon flying over a red city, the banner of House Blackfyre. In short you could say that this visions means "a black dragon will come to KL". Could this possibly hint to the fact that Aegon is indeed a Blackfyre and that he will take King's Landing in TWoW?Â
1803	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-15	To be fair, I don't think that the date of those events was specified. There have been dragons over Kings's Landing in the past and the WW aren't new either.
And obviously it trivializes Bran's journey - it seems as if he's now about as skilled as he is in ADWD, being able to get glimpses off changing into trees.


Â 
But at no point has the throne room been destroyed... yet.
Â 
Also, the Sept of Baelor was built after the last dragon was known to exist so any scene with a dragon and the Sept cannot be a past event (Bran's dream at this point does not appear to show enough of KL to include the Sept)
1804	Konradsmith	2014-04-15	The little girl is the undead girl from the first episode's cold open, Dustdevil. As I said, most of it is stock footage.
1805	TheBadboy	2014-04-15	Correct me. 
I thought I heard someone scream North in the end!  And it seemed like Stannis.
1806	IlAovatar	2014-04-15	I really hope the wintery throne room is a hint that the Others will get at least as far as KL, and not a hint about Jon ruling.
1807	Konradsmith	2014-04-15	^Depending on what theories you believe, those two possibilities might not be mutually exclusive.
1808	Mel_Rose	2014-04-15	I saw it more as a sign of the 'winter is coming' thing, in a literal sense (snow, cold) and a metaphorical (disaster and destruction).
Â 
The Others might not get that far, but KL will be destroyed somehow.

1809	HelenaExMachina	2014-04-15	There was also a glimpse of what appeared to be an (un)dead horse. Just throwing that in there
1810	Angmar	2014-04-15	I thought the emphasis on ravens could have been a hint of Coldhands...
1811	WTFSalami	2014-04-15	Every shot we saw in the vision with the exception of the tree in the sunlight, a shot of some weirwood roots, the dragon over King's Landing, and the White Walker through ice is something we've already seen on the show. 
The little girl in the woods is the undead girl from the pilot episode. The undead horse is the season 2 finale. The ravens are from the closing scene of Sam killing the White Walker. And of course Eddard oiling his sword in the godswood and then being visited by Varys in the black cells. 
There doesn't seem to be any real discernible flow to them, more like they were just a bunch of cryptic looking shots that they threw together.
					
					
							Edited by WTFSalami, 15 April 2014 - 05:25 AM.
1812	Mithras	2014-04-15	Jon will be in a coma and his true parentage will be declared to him in the crypts by Bran and possibly Ned's ghost.
Â 
Cersei will lose all her three children by the time the shadow of the Drogon with Dany on his back will be seen in KL. She will understand the younger and more beautiful queen to defeat her is Dany. She will reactivate the wildfire plot of Aerys to prevent Dany from winning the prize.
Â 
I don't think Aegon (the black dragon) will take KL.
Â 
The new weirwood tree might be the entrance to the cave of the CotF.

1813	SheRa Seastar	2014-04-15	I thought the weir wood tree was literally where to find BR, seeing as cold hands isn't there to show them.
1814	HelenaExMachina	2014-04-15	I thought the weir wood tree was literally where to find BR, seeing as cold hands isn't there to show them.


The one in the vision on the ledge/hillside? I imagine so. I'm personally thinking Bran and co. will meet Leaf in the show, who will guide them to the cave
1815	'96Buck	2014-04-15	Agree the Weirwood on the ridge is the destination.Â  It is there that Bran now knows he must go.Â  I think the snowy throne, rather than showing that winter has taken KL and opened the throne room to the elements, means that the road to the throne will lead through the North.Â  I don't disagree with it also referring to Jon Snow, or more broadly, Starks in that Winter is Coming.
Â 
Interesting thought with red/black and Blackfyre.Â  The Blackfyres aren't very established yet, though, in the show, that I recall.Â  Of course, neither is Jon Connington and we don't have the Battle of the Bells @ Stoney Sept, which IIRC we are "supposed" to have by now, which is the books setup for Jon Connington.Â  Jon Snow bearing the name of Rhaegar's best friend might not be a nothing.Â  He certainly couldn't be running around with a Targaryen/Valyrian name, could he?
Â 
I don't agree that the fact that we've seen the images before indicates they are without meaning...the opposite, in fact, might be more true.
1816	zJordan	2014-04-15	Third time we've seen the Throne room like that, looks as if Winter will lead to the demise of the Iron Throne. Wolves thrive in winter!
1817	VeturKemur	2014-04-15	Some of those glimpses were so creepy, like the one of the white walker through the ice or whatever that was, I don't even know. It was so cool.


I've paused it to get a closer look at what/who that is. It definitely has blue eyes but it looks more like a wight than an Other. It also looks like it's wearing a crown but that could be just the ice.
1818	ovis alba	2014-04-15	Â 
I saw someone say something about that snowy throne room possibly symbolizing Jon on the throne, as we are seeing "snow on the throne" Â . Not too sure what I think of that idea, but that would be pretty crafty.


Â 
There is another quiet popular Snow around that would be less crafty and more scary
1819	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-15	Another way to interpret the dragon shadow is Bran 'learning how to fly' (warg a dragon). I'm not saying he will warg into a dragon over KL but the dragon shadow was done from the dragons POV. It was as if he was seeing through the eyes of the dragon much like the earlier scene of him waging Summer while he was hunting in the forest.
					
					
							Edited by ~DarkHorse~, 15 April 2014 - 10:18 AM.
1820	John Suburbs	2014-04-15	That was my first thought of the dragon shadow. Looked like a warging shot. How cool would that be?
1821	Lord Jennings	2014-04-15	The one in the vision on the ledge/hillside? I imagine so. I'm personally thinking Bran and co. will meet Leaf in the show, who will guide them to the cave


Â 
I think you are right. the three eyed crow and a "child of the forest" was cast for this season. I read the article about it yesterday. Don't think we will see Coldhands.
Â 
Â 


Correct me.
I thought I heard someone scream North in the end! And it seemed like Stannis.


Â 
"Look for me beneath the tree... NORTH" - That was said by BR in my opinion. That's who they are looking for and after Bran came back to he said he knew where they needed to go.
1822	sati	2014-04-15	Didn't the person who was answering the questions about screeners say we actually get to see

	Spoiler Bloodraven in the vision? Did they remove him? Is there another vision next episode?

1825	Masha	2014-04-15	Got to ask this question. ARe those visions made up by show runners or byÂ GRRM?
Â 
I know GRRM said that he wrote the episode, but I also remember reading somewhere that part of the episodes, some of the scenes other than from Kings landing, were cut from 1st episode and put onto 2nd.
Â 
I don't know which scenes were that - Stannis, Dreadfort, or Bran's - but some of them were not written/adapted by GRRM but by screen writer who wrote episode 1.
Â 
IF it were Bran's, then it those visions were something cool looking and generic that continue Dany's visions (that were completely different from the book's) andÂ don't mean anything other than "winter is coming to kings landing" that just been approved by GRRM and not actually written by him or mean anything big.
Â 
Does anyone know which scenes in this episode were moved from ep 1?
Â 
Â
1826	Daughter of Death	2014-04-15	I saw somewhere that the episode 10 is named the Children so I assume that is when we meet Leaf.Â 
Octavia Alexandru has been cast as a Child of the Forest so I hope she's playing Leaf

I'm fairly certain the Bran stuff was written my GRRM but I don't know if there is any way of knowing for sure.Â
1828	Daughter of Death	2014-04-15	Crypts of WinterfellÂ -Â Â The first vision we see is that of a heart tree, followed by the TRV flying through the crypts of Winterfell.

Yesss I got that feeling too! I am a huge lover of the cript discussions so I'm glad that there are some hints in the show too.

I'm not sure if GRRM wrote it or not, but in any case I wouldn't be worried, since the creators are known fans that love the books, know the ending and also know how to foreshadow Â i dont think the things in the show that are different is going to change too much, only add to it.

1830	RoamingRonin	2014-04-15	Bran looked at the crow on his shoulder, and the crow looked back. It had three eyes, and the third eye was full of a terrible knowledge. Bran looked down. There was nothing below him now but snow and cold and death, a frozen wasteland where jagged blue-white spires of ice waited to embrace him. They flew up at him like spears. He saw the bones of a thousand other dreamers impaled upon their points. He was desperately afraid.
Â 
There's a point in the vision where we see shards of ice and a face of an Other. I think that's a modified version of this vision from the book.Â
1831	'96Buck	2014-04-15	Â 
I saw somewhere that the episode 10 is named the Children so I assume that is when we meet Leaf.Â

Â 


lots of Children (or the child generation, at least) to perhaps "move" in episode 10...Bran meets Child of the Forest, Arya boards a ship or arrives in Braavos, Sansa reaches the Eyrie or kills Lysana, not sure where Jon ends up this season, LC needs to come sooner, is getting killed too late?Â Â  Stannis better get a move on.Â  Something with Shireen? Tommen?
1832	HouseHarrison	2014-04-15	I have no idea what that thing was through the ice. Was it just a white walker?
Â 
and imo the "snow on the throne" is an indication that Jon Snow will ultimately win the Game of Thrones. D&D have apparently been told the ending by GRRM.
1833	Xcorpyo001	2014-04-15	Is the snow Bran sees falling of the Iron Throne similar with the Snow Mel keeps seeing when she asks for a vision of AA?
Or is the Wall messing with both their vision reception in that area?
Anyway, a lot of snow in these visions send by two completely different/unrelated deities..probably means nothing though.
1834	donalnig	2014-04-15	http://youtu.be/wEBTxrvzvNAÂ what's that supposed to be at 3:08?? if it's bloodraven ill be extremely disappointed!!Â
1835	Fevre River Warrior	2014-04-15	I am not sure about Jon Snow discovering the truth of his parentage in the crypts. Who would believe him? If he has this vision and he knows it how would he convince the rest of the world that R+L=J? What proof would he have? Even if he got something out of Lyanna's crypt he would have to have the fact substantiated by someone else.
Â 
I like the theory that the High Septon in TDWD is Howland Reed. Someone with high standing would have to state it and then prove it. Or maybe the dragon Rhaegal will have some role in it.
Â 
Or maybe this is just another twist that I cannot see yet. Only time will tell.

Â 
This revelation will not affect Jon much because he will be concentrated on the war against the Others. I think he will continue what he is doing, i.e. organizing the people against the common threat. After the Wall fails and no other person left to play the game of thrones except Dany, he will press his claim to unite what force left in the Realm under his command against the Others. People will believe his claim after he saves the humanity. There cannot be a more convincing proof than this.
1837	plurabel	2014-04-15	I like that Meera says to Bran "Without you, we have nothing". I'm sure she doesn't mean that without Bran she, Jojen and Hodor have nothing but something broader.Â
1838	Seneti	2014-04-15	I actually tried making a thread on this topic but it hasn't gone up until now. Anyways here's my interpretation of each and every vision except for the last one where BR says "North":
Â 
Crypts of WinterfellÂ -Â Â The first vision we see is that of a heart tree, followed by the TRV flying through the crypts of Winterfell. Directly after that, we see the image Eddard Stark sharpening Ice and the close shot of his eye in the Black Cells of the Red Keep when Varys comes to visit him in season 1.

The fact that Eddard is being shown could be hinting towards the fact that he knew something about the crypts and about the secret that he took with him to his grave (Which is that R+L=J).
Â 
The Little Girl - After that vision, we see an image of a girl in robes standing in the woods beyond the wall. In the background we hear a voice, obviously BR, saying that Bran should look for him "beneath the tree". As many pointed out from one of the trailers, this girl could be one of the CotF and in this case, BR is hinting to Bran as to who will help him find him.
Â 
Snow on the Throne and WinterÂ - After this we see a series of visions all dealing with the coming Winter. We see the Other's dead horse from the end of season 2, we see one staring through what looks like a frozen river and we see, once again, Snow on the Iron Throne. There are two ways of interpreting this. On the one hand, you could simply say that BR is trying to show Bran the ultimate outcome if he is to fail in his mission to stop the WW.

It doesn't necessarily mean that he will sit on the IT or become King, just that he is Rhaegar's son and therefore, the true heir to the IT.
Â 
Bran fallingÂ - This is one of the visions that I loved the most. We see Bran falling down the tower, with Cersei screaming "He saw us!" in the background. Could this possibly point towards Bran regaining his memory of why he fell? How would that have any significance for his story if he finds out why or how he fell, especially if he is to be the next greenseer?
Â 
The Black Dragon over Kings LandingÂ - I'm just going to flat out say it here. I don't think that this is hinting to Dany heading to KL, and that it is just there to put the show watchers off. I think this scene is hinting more to the fact that Aegon will take KL since it only shows the shadow of a dragon looming over it. In the books, we know that "dragons" in prophecies don't have to literally mean dragons but that they could be refering to Targaryens or Blackfyres instead. The fact that it is only the shadow that we see is also interesting:Â It is a black dragon flying over a red city, the banner of House Blackfyre. In short you could say that this visions means "a black dragon will come to KL". Could this possibly hint to the fact that Aegon is indeed a Blackfyre and that he will take King's Landing in TWoW?Â 


Â 
About the crypts: I like that theory, although I think it might also symbolize Bran's journey (Winterfell --> Ned's Death --> hiding in the crypts --> going north).
Â 
The little girl: As others have pointed out, this is clearly the Wight girl from episode 1 of season 1. After that, we see an undead horse and the White Walker through the ice, which to me means pointing out the dangers of going north / showing Bran what's awaiting him up there.
Â 
Snow on the throne: This could have so many different interpretations. We know that winter will definitely arrive in KL. It might also mean that the White Walkers will arrive in KL or that KL will be nothing but ruins and ash when all is said and done (general symbolism: winter = death) or it might mean that Snow (Jon) will sit on the IT.
Â 
Bran falling: I agree. This most likely symbolizes Bran's memory returning.
Â 
Dragon over KL: Interesting theory which I fully support.

ah! thank the god's for that!
1840	ViennaGirl	2014-04-15	I love this thread. I love the dragon shadow possibly being Aegon casting a shadow over KL. The Snow on the throne seems a little obvious, but maybe that's because we're here on this forum. I'm sorry Coldhands isn't in the story because it means he's not important to the bigger story, but I love seeing more visions - the HOTU visions were so long ago - I needed more. I hope we get some more warging visions as well, from Bran, Arya and Jon.Â
1841	Jaheira	2014-04-15	Dragons flying over KL and the IT covered by snow definitely reminds me of "A Song of Ice and Fire" !
1842	Daughter of Death	2014-04-15	I dunno I kinda feel as if the dragons in KL IS dany, but the war is too destructive and the importance of the WW is overlooked by the players in the war and they will take over the ruins of westeros (this is IF something doesnt change, bran/jon/anybody fighting off/helping in someway to destroy the WW. the fact that they are in the visions is a warning to bran in some ways.
Â 
z little off topic but my hope for the asoiaf-thing is ice=jon dany=fire and somehow they both help in overcoming the WW. the importance of dany and the DRAGONS(VERY OLD MAGIC) is heavily undermined in some of the discussions here...
Â 
could also be fire=r'hllor ice=ww.. i dunno..Â 
Â 
i do think the snow on the throne isn't so much philosophic but more of a warning of what will happen if something isnt done about the WW
1843	Ser Bran Stark	2014-04-15	I thought I was the only one who noticed that. The snow in the throne room is a previous scene from HOTU in season 2 along with the others you listed. There will be no COTF in the HBO version and it seemed that it was just thrown together...BUT I still think they have meaning.
1844	HelenaExMachina	2014-04-16	There are going to be COTF, one of them has been cast at least

Â 
Child of the Forest appears in finale, at least it looks this way. As for the throne room the shot they used was from the same set as HoU, yes, but it was a brand new angle from what I could tell.
1846	Mel_Rose	2014-04-16	I like that Meera says to Bran "Without you, we have nothing". I'm sure she doesn't mean that without Bran she, Jojen and Hodor have nothing but something broader.Â 


Â 
Bran was the first POV in the story and I have the feeling that he will be the instrumental character for the end. I see him a little as Frodo, the character that is isolated by all the action, the plotting, the wars; the character who has the hardest path to follow (Mordor/Beyond the Wall); and will -very possibly - be the last POV making the story come full circle. GRRM had thought of the endgame when he started writing the books so maybe his decision to start with Bran and not one of the other POVs of the Starks is telling.

what makes you say that? about the COTF.Â
1849	Stark11	2014-04-16	Long time reader of the forum and first time poster here, hopefully I do this right.
So I don't know how many of you watch the 'Inside the Episode' videos after they air but for episodes 2 video D&D talk about Brans visions. I'm pretty sure they say they picked each one very carefully and the one they thought was the most important was the destroyed throne room with snow falling on it.
I think it symbolizes 2 things: what's going to happen in the future war with Aegon and the Lannisters/Tyrells/Other allies. If I remember right snow has begun to fall in KL at the end of ADWD. And second that Snow (Jon Snow) will end up saving what is rightfully his, the Iron Throne.
Â 
Â 
Edit: I re-watched the video and they actual say the dragon flying across Kings Landing was the most important vision. My bad.Â

1852	Takiedevushkikakzvezdy	2014-04-16	I know the show is following its own canon but isn`t it supposed to snow in KL by the end of ADWD? In that case, how can the dragon shadow be a vision of the future?

Â 
It is a vision. Â It can be past, present or future.
Â 
Snow comes and goes, even in this universe.
1854	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-04-16	Correct me.
I thought I heard someone scream North in the end! And it seemed like Stannis.


That was Bloodraven screaming North. He was basically telling Bran where to find him. He also says to look under the tree. After rewatching the scene though I can easily see how you would think it sounded like Stannis. However, it's clearly Bloodraven talking the whole time so it would make little sense to switch to Stannis at the end.Â
1855	lightbringer333	2014-04-16	Why in brans dream Ned was shown from dungeon. Is it related with bloodraven who also spent his life in dungeon.
1856	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-04-16	I actually tried making a thread on this topic but it hasn't gone up until now. Anyways here's my interpretation of each and every vision except for the last one where BR says "North":
Â 
Crypts of WinterfellÂ -Â Â The first vision we see is that of a heart tree, followed by the TRV flying through the crypts of Winterfell. Directly after that, we see the image Eddard Stark sharpening Ice and the close shot of his eye in the Black Cells of the Red Keep when Varys comes to visit him in season 1. You could simply say that this is repetition of Bran's previous vision in season 1 where he predicts his fathers death, but I think it points to the importance of the crypts of Winterfell. Many here on the forums believe that the Crypts of Winterfell will have some importance in the revealing of Jon's parentage and that something is hidden in Lyanna's crypt specifically. The fact that Eddard is being shown could be hinting towards the fact that he knew something about the crypts and about the secret that he took with him to his grave (Which is that R+L=J).
Â 
The Little Girl - After that vision, we see an image of a girl in robes standing in the woods beyond the wall. In the background we hear a voice, obviously BR, saying that Bran should look for him "beneath the tree". As many pointed out from one of the trailers, this girl could be one of the CotF and in this case, BR is hinting to Bran as to who will help him find him.
Â 
Snow on the Throne and WinterÂ - After this we see a series of visions all dealing with the coming Winter. We see the Other's dead horse from the end of season 2, we see one staring through what looks like a frozen river and we see, once again, Snow on the Iron Throne. There are two ways of interpreting this. On the one hand, you could simply say that BR is trying to show Bran the ultimate outcome if he is to fail in his mission to stop the WW. On the other hand, the fact that they are showing us the same imagery from Dany's vision at the HotU could point towards a stronger meaning of this scene. It could be that this directly points towards Jon Snow's actual parentage. Just like how the first vision could point to it, this vision could mean that snow is of royal heritage. It doesn't necessarily mean that he will sit on the IT or become King, just that he is Rhaegar's son and therefore, the true heir to the IT.
Â 
Bran fallingÂ - This is one of the visions that I loved the most. We see Bran falling down the tower, with Cersei screaming "He saw us!" in the background. Could this possibly point towards Bran regaining his memory of why he fell? How would that have any significance for his story if he finds out why or how he fell, especially if he is to be the next greenseer?
Â 
The Black Dragon over Kings LandingÂ - I'm just going to flat out say it here. I don't think that this is hinting to Dany heading to KL, and that it is just there to put the show watchers off. I think this scene is hinting more to the fact that Aegon will take KL since it only shows the shadow of a dragon looming over it. In the books, we know that "dragons" in prophecies don't have to literally mean dragons but that they could be refering to Targaryens or Blackfyres instead. The fact that it is only the shadow that we see is also interesting:Â It is a black dragon flying over a red city, the banner of House Blackfyre. In short you could say that this visions means "a black dragon will come to KL". Could this possibly hint to the fact that Aegon is indeed a Blackfyre and that he will take King's Landing in TWoW?Â 


Woah awesome theory about the Black Dragon over KL. Didn't think about the black on red aspect. I believe Aegon 1) is a blackfyre and 2)Â will sit the IT (at least for a little bit) so I'm fully on board. You're right about dragons in prophecies never being about a literal dragon but more of symbol for Targs or Blackfyres. I'm really hoping the vision alludes to either this, or Bran warging a dragon, considering it representing Dany in KL is too obvious.Â

1857	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-04-16	Is the snow Bran sees falling of the Iron Throne similar with the Snow Mel keeps seeing when she asks for a vision of AA?
Or is the Wall messing with both their vision reception in that area?
Anyway, a lot of snow in these visions send by two completely different/unrelated deities..probably means nothing though.


When Mel asks to see AA she says R'hllor shows me only Snow. The key is that the S is capitalized and therefore is referring to Jon Snow not the substance snow.Â
1858	Takiedevushkikakzvezdy	2014-04-16	Â 
It is a vision. Â It can be past, present or future.
Â 
Snow comes and goes, even in this universe.


It`s definitely not the present, since there are no dragons over KL right now, and it looked very sunny and warm and really didn`t seem like winter.
1859	pantouflas	2014-04-16	I thought 'Snow in the Throne Room' and 'Dragon Over KL' were D&amp;D's way of introducing the Song of Ice and Fire endgame speculation. Show watchers don't know the book series has this title, but now they should suspect a Jon Snow+Dany endgame like we (book readers) do.. Which of course could turn out to be totally different - never trust prophesies and all that.
Something not many people in this thread realize: the face in the ice shards and the zombie horse face were shown before, at the end of season 2. They belong to the Other leading the White Walkers. It might be a confirmation that this character (King of the Others?) will indeed play a role in the future, something we haven't seen in the books yet.
Final thing that people have mentioned, but doesn't seem to impress anyone: we have seen the hill that is over the cave! I think it is pretty obvious that the entrance is under, or through, the Weirwood Tree from the vision. BR says that clearly I think

1860	BorhPT	2014-04-17	Does anyone notices the hints left in the first 3 scenes? They are the first vision and are separated from the rest and after watching this video - https://www.youtube....h?v=b77r5ip7USQ -Â i was sure they were important.
Â 
First: The 3 Eyed Raven going into the CRYPTS of Winterfell.
Second: Ned Stark holding his valyrian steel sword - ICE.
Third - A close-up of his eye, lighted by a flame - FIRE.
Â 
ICE + FIRE + CRYPTS. I definitely think there's something down there and it can be a Ice Dragon (i would loooove that), but i guess it's actually a hint on R+L=J... Rhaegar = the Fire, Lyanna = the Ice, Crypts = Ned's secret hidden in there.
Â 
Â 
The rest of the vision i think it's BloodRaven telling Bran to follow the ravens and beware of the Others. The scene where we see ice and the WW behind him i think it didnt happened in the series and will probably be shown later this season. It's a Ice shard, with a Walker behind. Im not sure of this but i think you can see a bit of human skin beneath his face, kind of distorted in the ice ... the Aurora in the sky in the upper left corner. I think that's maybe a baby on a ice altar. I don't think we've heard of any rituals the WW do, but it could be something like this (it's a weird image, i'm probably very wrong on this).
Then we see Cersei saying 'he saw us', at the same time the walker appears. Then Bran falls while screaming 'Mother' and we see the dragon flying over KL. then we see again Bran falling. But I don't know what to think of that.
1861	Envie	2014-04-17	Great discussion here. I'll just go ahead and repeat what I said in another thread about 'hints' GRRM may have written into the episode since much of that discussion was also about Bran's visions with the weir tree.
Â 
It's my theory and best guess that they were purposely being confusing with all the flashes and mishsmash of scenes because Bran's never done "weirnet" surfing before. He has no idea what he's seeing in most of it - yet. Â In the books, he started learning from Bloodraven, but in the show he hasn't gotten there yet. There's no Coldhands to guide him so the tree has to do it and Bloodraven's trying to communicate to him over all the 'white noise' of the images stored there.
Â 
Remember, the weir trees hold knowledge of the past as well - even moreso than the future because they have 'seen' and stored all those memories and experiences for thousands of years. The images of the dragons could just as well be from previous eras.
Â 
Bran, as the Game of Thrones "Neo" of sorts, has to learn to navigate the matrix as he 'jacks in' and experiences what must be very overwhelming images, sounds, voices, memories, etc etc. I always imagined it was like hearing thousands of people talking and remembering things at once. Hard to decipher anything meaningful at first until you start weeding things out. I also imagine the images will get clearer and more well defined to Bran as well as to us the viewers as he does it more and of course once he finds Boodraven and starts getting some proper training in it.
1862	Big Daddy	2014-04-17	Â In the books, he started learning from Bloodraven, but in the show he hasn't gotten there yet. There's no Coldhands to guide him so the tree has to do it and Bloodraven's trying to communicate to him over all the 'white noise' of the images stored there.
Â 
Â 


Â 
Â 
I think this episode proved that unless there's something important about his reveal in the books, that Coldhands is entirely expendable to the story. They can perform CH's function by getting Bran to BR the way they are doing through the weirnet. As mch as I don't relish the thought of eliminating or amalgams of characters, it does need to be done on the show to streamline the sheer number of characters down to a manageable amount.

Â 
I agree, sadly, that Coldhands was likely dropped to conserve on casting and more scenes. As much as that probably upsets some fans of the character as well as the mystery of his identity. I remember my first read-through I was completely convinced he was Benjen Stark who we also have no idea what happened to in the story. Now I'm not so sure either of them end up being of any real importance - or if they are, not until much later towards the end of the story.
Â 
I think it was clever to use the weirnet / tree as the 'guide' for Bran in the show and introduces the vision / weirnet surfing earlier than waiting until he's met Bloodraven.Â
1864	John Suburbs	2014-04-17	I think it's clear that the dragons will appear over KL at some point and scorch the roof off the throne room. If this is a vision of the future and not a future, it means Dany will finally ditch Essos and head for Westeros. About time.
1865	MoA«t	2014-04-17	Another way to interpret the dragon shadow is Bran 'learning how to fly' (warg a dragon). I'm not saying he will warg into a dragon over KL but the dragon shadow was done from the dragons POV. It was as if he was seeing through the eyes of the dragon much like the earlier scene of him waging Summer while he was hunting in the forest.


Totally agree with this.

Â 


I think snow on the Iron Throne seen by Dany, Mel, and now Bran, means everything.
Â

I like that Meera says to Bran "Without you, we have nothing". I'm sure she doesn't mean that without Bran she, Jojen and Hodor have nothing but something broader.Â 

I beleive Meera says, "If we lose you, we lose everything." which is much broader, and definitely means everything.

I can't agree.Â  If dragons are "wargable" it means Targaryen blood is worthless.Â  Other than Bran, the strongest, best trained wargs are Wildlings so they will take 2 of the 3.Â  Ignoring that, sure, it's a great Stark comeback if Bran/Arya/Jon Snow take the 3 dragons, torch KL and Casterly Rock, kill the remaining Targaryen (s?) and put Jon on the Iron Throne, moved to a rebuilt Winterfell...but I don't feel like that's the arc the story is on.

cant really see your point in how the targs would be worthless if bran (who is very special and probably the centralÂ character when it comes to the ending) could warg a dragon?Â
1870	Beric175	2014-04-18	I want to see Bran warg into a dragon now.
Â 
Seriously, fior what the show has promised (dragons coming to KL, Others destroying everything) they kept their eyes on that ball with his vision here so kudos. Is it me, or didwe see a veeeeeery quick shot of an Other through an ice surface in there?

of course they are doing Lady S. She's a major character for the Starks story. Why else would Michelle Fairley be doing promo tours and interviews for GoT?

Disagree.
Â 
When you watch the dragon shadow, watch the left wing. For a frame it's a bird wing - you can see light through the gaps in feathers.
Â 
I've got to agree with Bran warging a dragon. That also means Jon and Arya might be able to too. I just hope they hurry up and get to their talents soon, and don't skip it.
1877	John Suburbs	2014-04-18	I suspect that this season's final scene will be Nymeria pulling Cat's body out of the river, Beric sacrificing himself to reanimate Cat, and then Cat opening her eyes.

i really hope thats not how she's revealed. i cant really remember who or when it was that met her in a tavern or something and she was rolling robbs crown? thats sorta how she should be revealed i think.. sorta mysteriously and you cant quite understand who she is at first but then you get the full story. then thoros explains what and who she is just as shes killing a frey or something.. something in that way would be more eerie to me. not from her first breath. she should just appear.

1885	OnlyOne	2014-04-22	Dany saw a throne room with snow falling. Bran saw a black dragon flying over a clearly destroyed throne room-and I think it was ash he saw falling. Definitely both future I think. Think about it. Think.
1886	HelenaExMachina	2014-04-22	^I might need to rewatch it, but I thought the Dragon vision was over an intact King's Landing?
1887	Falcon2908	2014-12-06	Hi,
Â 
First time poster.Â Â  Did anyone notice, in the scene with the dragon flying over King's Landing, that there was snow on the ground?Â  This could foreshadow Dany's arrival at KL.


Amazing... I haven't noticed that yet but I'll watch the video again
1888	Ghosts Lunch	2014-12-07	IT shot is interesting, Obviously could symbolise KL literally gets trashed etc
Â 
I wonder if there is a wider point though, in that it is Aegon 1 legacy being undone and the Seven Kingdoms as a single entity is broken up again
Â 
Personally I am in two camps about this, on the one hand we are encouraged to see it as a single Kingdom etc but I want to see an independent North at the end of it all for my part
Â 
I think everywhere except Dorne perhaps will get trashed, Aegon will rip the Stormlands to shreds and Euron will rip the Reach to shreds. As we already know everywhere else like the Riverlands and the North is already trashed
1889	libertine	2014-12-08	I see, many of you think that the Dragon over Kings Landing means, Aegon will take the city (Black Dragon over Red City being the Blackfyre Colours), I have to admit, I seriously doubt that we will even have an Aegon in the show. The producers have stated that Tyrion will interact with Dany in season 5, which means there wouldn't be much time for him traveling with Aegon and Jon Con down the Rhoyne and stuff. Moreover it would be kinda strange to introduce such a big charakter in the tv show. Well, I get that Martin did the same in the books, but let's face the truth: Most of the show watchers wouldn't even know who that particular Aegon even was (some wouldn't even know Rhaegar), which would make things even more complicated for the non-reading audience.Â 
Â 
My prediction is that the dragon in Bran's vision in fact symbolizes Danaerys. The story will move forward quickly in season 5 and lots of storylines will merge together or get cut out. So the Meereenese Knot will be solved and Dany will be on her way to Westeros (accompanied by Tyrion) by the end of the season.
As for the "Snow on the Iron Throne" thing, I pretty much think it means that Jon Snow will end up there at some point in the show, although i kinda doubt, that's what's gonna happen in the books. But hey, great stuff for an entertaining TV series.
1890	TimeThief	2014-04-28	Now, I'm doing this completely based off memory, so correct me if I'm wrong, but I do remember from A Storm of Swords that Tyrion realized that Joffrey was the one who attempted to kill Bran way back when he was still in Winterfell and in a coma by using his dagger. Â I believe he realized this sometime around the rehearsal dinner part of the wedding, when Joffrey is receiving his gifts (including Tyrion's book).Â 
Â 
I'm curious as to why D&D didn't want to add that into this season seeing as it was a mystery that was never solved in the first season (again, if I remember correctly) because of all the confusion that happened after Robert's death. Â I know it would've been a difficult thing to randomly bring back up again, but I wanted to hear what other people thought about it.
1891	King Tyrion I	2014-11-06	I would have also liked it if that this "mystery" had been solved and uncovered. But I think they dropped it because of lack of time. You know the episodes are not that long - roughly about an hour - and I think they wanted to focus on the main event. The marriage and Joffrey's ultimate demise.
Â 
Of course, the book readers (I also read the books) want more details. More things from the books. But I guess there need to be compromises and cuts.

1892	Kikajon	2014-11-08	Not everyone in this forum, including me, believed that theory.
I believe that we'll not have further details in the books though..I fear this side part of the story will not be taken into further details.
But if GRRM will write,more on it I think the Joff theory will be discarded.
If so, it makes sense that even in the show wasn't mentioned.
1893	Jehane	2014-11-21	That's the first time I read about this theory - can't remember Tyrion connecting Joffrey to the murder attempt on Bran but it's been years since I read Storm. I'm currently re-reading but haven't even finished AGoT yet so I'm really curious to know if there really is a sentence like "Oh, now I know - Joffrey tried to murder Bran. Bastard!" in Storm. And if there is - what possible reason would Joffrey have to kill Bran? The only two people who might want Bran dead are Cersei and Jaime because Bran has seen them. Also, I seem to remember that on the Show, one of them - either Cersei or Jaime, can't remember which - asked the other one if they had become completely stupid by stealing and using that dagger to kill the boy.
1894	somethingorother	2014-11-22	The show left it out. Both Tyrion and Jaime suspected Joff tried to have Bran killed to impress King Robert. Robert drunkenly said that Bran was better off dead so the poor assassination attempt using one of Robert's knives.
Even in the book its very murky as both are just guessing and it is such a huge risk to Littlefinger to lie about the knife. The show made the right decision to just forget about it and move on.
1895	Annara Snow	2014-11-22	The show left it out. Both Tyrion and Jaime suspected Joff tried to have Bran killed to impress King Robert. Robert drunkenly said that Bran was better off dead so the poor assassination attempt using one of Robert's knives.

Â 
Littlefinger is taking huge risks all the time in order to create chaos. It's his MO.
1896	Lord Lannister	2014-11-23	Yes, yes... there's always a "theory" that there's not a single thing in Westeros that can't somehow be attributed to Littlefinger, Varys or Bloodraven.
1897	Jamie Lannister	2014-04-14	What did you think? Is it amusing to give the guy an equally psychotic girlfriend, or are they just building up a filler villain for Asha Yara to kill later on, given Ramsay's going to survive for a long while?
1898	Charles Phipps	2014-04-15	I think the chief reason she exists is to provide Ramsey someone to play off on.
Probably nudity as well, knowing HBO.
1899	voodooqueen126	2014-04-15	She exists for nudity.
1900	I'll pay the iron price	2014-04-15	Yeah I guess its setting up something with Yara's rescue mission
1901	Charles Phipps	2014-04-15	She exists for nudity.


Â 
I dunno, she was fully dressed in a rather form fitting leather outfit this episode but was quite dressed and psychotic.

I imagine she'll seduce Theon (figuratively) into betraying Ramsey if she's the Jeyne Poole substitute.
1902	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-15	I thought she may be one of Ramsay's eventual torture victims. Knowing how psycho he is, I just assumed once he's sick of Myranda or she expects too much from him, Ramsay will turn on her.
1903	ladyinblack	2014-04-15	It bothers me that the girls name is Myranda....and Sansa seems to becoming friends with Myranda Royce in the books...that Domeric ( not mentioned in the show, at least yet) was fostered in the Vale
& all the liberties the show has taken with plots and names thus far
Â 
Â doesn't Ramsay refer to his dogs as the girls & name them after those they have hunted down
Now Ramsays' girls are literal? 
Alfie Allen is doing a superb job of playing Theon & I am starting to think the Rmsay casting is ok too. Didn't like him last year.
1904	elenhay	2014-04-15	I agree that she may be someone to play off for Ramsey, but also for him to later torture? To show that even if Ramsey seems to like you and you play his games with him, he'll torture and kill you eventually anyway. A kind of 'kick the dog' moment.
1905	Hath4	2014-04-15	It bothers me that the girls name is Myranda....and Sansa seems to becoming friends with Myranda Royce in the books...that Domeric ( not mentioned in the show, at least yet) was fostered in the Vale

1906	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-15	I'm thinking that Ramsay will turn on her once he gets bored of her.Â
1907	Cas Stark	2014-04-15	It bothers me that the girls name is Myranda....and Sansa seems to becoming friends with Myranda Royce in the books...that Domeric ( not mentioned in the show, at least yet) was fostered in the Vale

Based on their naming conventions, it suggests that Myranda Royce won't be in the show...I mean if they changed Asha's name to Yara, because it was "confusing" with Osha....

just a little musing

Â but agree that this girl will rue the day she became playmates with Ramsay
yes, Ramsay does say down girls to the dogs...missed that before

She was already completely nude in season 3. She and one other girl were helping Ramsay torture Theon. Theon won't ever trust that

1911	Benjaario Starkharis	2014-04-15	The hunt makes it pretty likely that she's going to be the one hunted next time.
1912	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-15	She's there for the nudity, no doubt. From the trailers I'm guessing a sex scene will lead to Ramsay being shirtless and covered in blood...probably her blood.
They want to remind people just how dangerous Ramsay is. His fellow psycho's are just pawns that cant even escape his cruelty- they aren't playing with him, he's playing with them. It also serves to remind us that pawn Theon (Reek) will never be safe, no matter how obedient he is. Ramsay is in charge and he can kill him when ever he wants.
Although, knowing HBO, they probably jumped at the opportunity of more boobs.
1913	Frumpus	2014-04-15	I think it was just an excuse to bring back a minor character from S3, even though most of the audience will have forgotten about her when watching the episode and wouldn't remember until afterwards when they googled it.
Â I know I hadn't put the connection together when I watched the episode.
Â 
Also was the girl they hunted the other girl involved in Theon's scene last year?
1914	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-15	Â 
Â 
Also was the girl they hunted the other girl involved in Theon's scene last year?


Â 
Nope, different actress (last year's actress was pregnant this year) and different character (Violet last year and Tansy in this scene)
1915	Frumpus	2014-04-15	Â 
Nope, different actress (last year's actress was pregnant this year) and different character (Violet last year and Tansy in this scene)


I bet they were going to use Violet but the actress being pregnant that would have been too much, so they brought in a new actress and new character.
1916	I'll pay the iron price	2014-04-15	Theon is an idiot.


Â 
I used to think that too but when you delve into his character deeply you realise he is a victim
Victim of his own Â moronic father
Theon payed for his Fathers crime of rebellion then when he went home years later he was shunned so he did what he did at Winterfell in a blind attempt to win his fathers admiration!
1917	Red Wedding Cake	2014-04-15	I think she's there to throw us off of Ramsay's obsession with Reek, but we all know Reek is the one Ramsay really cares about.
1918	Osric	2014-04-15	I know she is too old but, what if she is used as fake Arya or something
1919	Hath4	2014-04-15	Myranda is not going to be farya she is not innocent and theon would not save a psychotic friend of ramsays.
1920	Er Rn	2014-04-15	Yeah, I don't see how she could be fArya unless they change that whole plot. Jeyne is a terrified young girl forced into the marriage, while Myranda...isn't. And I agree, Theon risking escape to save her makes no sense.
1921	Beric175	2014-04-18	Yara= Arya. Need I say more? She's gonna arrive at the Dreadfort, get betrayed by some of her men, one of whom turns out to be Euron (that guy with the scars over his eye) and Ramsay marries her in order to get rid of the threat of the Ironborn and Theon saves her because they're both characters the audience cares about to some extent so there are stakes there.
1922	franko99	2014-04-18	I'm ok with Myranda, I mean, if I have to choose between her or Yellow Dick, Myranda FTW 
Â 
I just hope her relationship with Ramsay doesn't take to much screen time in detriment of other story lines.Â 
Â 
Oh, and I also hope Yara put an end to her life when she attack the dreadfort.Â 

					
					
							Edited by franko99, 18 April 2014 - 10:55 AM.
1923	Beric175	2014-04-18	we know she'll get at least one sex scene with ramsay....lets hope it ends horribly for both parties involved .
1924	Empress Maude	2014-04-18	Yara= Arya. Need I say more?

Â 
I don't think the Northern lords could be fooled into believing Yara is Arya, though. The age and look are wrong and there is no way Yara would passively stand in the godswood and accept that marriage, imho.
1925	Beric175	2014-04-18	Would she cave if Ramsay threatened to torture her and Theon?
1926	Hath4	2014-04-18	yara would kill herself before ever submitting to ramsay. she would never agree no matter how many times ramsay torture's her.

1927	Beric175	2014-04-18	That is if Ramsay leaves her an opportunity to kill herself though.
1928	Empress Maude	2014-04-18	That is if Ramsay leaves her an opportunity to kill herself though.


Â 
I don't know, she could always make a scandal during the wedding proper, throw herself from a window, try to overpower Ramsay or any of the Bastard's Boys. Jeyne was broken and trained, but I can't honestly see Yara being broken like that.
1929	Rhaenys Reborn	2014-04-18	Â 
Based on their naming conventions, it suggests that Myranda Royce won't be in the show...I mean if they changed Asha's name to Yara, because it was "confusing" with Osha....


Â 
I find it downright stupid. Get rid of a lord's daughter Sansa befriends who might still play a part in her storyline in order toÂ introduce some random character who brings nothing to the plot and whose main reason for being there is her boobs 
Â 
even if they do introduce Myranda Royce with a changed first name, it will still be stupid. Just like it was stupid to turn Jeyne Westerling into bloody Talisa for no reason, as Jeyne Poole doesn't even exist in the show.
Â 
And don't even get me started on the Asha/Osha thing... I wonder what they will name JonCon when the time comes. I mean, we already do have a Jon, don't we? and I bet Jon Arryn will still get mentioned once or twice so that's two Jons already. No way we're getting another one
1930	Skagosi High Chef	2014-04-18	I thought it was a bad move on HBO's part. It humanizes Ramsay to an extent that the book doesn't. It robs the character of many aspects that makes Ramsay who he is and diminishes the Ramsay/Reek dynamic. Bad move. But yea, nudity, ok, I guess.

It robs the character of many aspects that makes Ramsay who he is and diminishes the Ramsay/Reek dynamic. Bad move. But yea, nudity, ok, I guess. myranda is a complete psychopath and a sadist so it does not humanize him.  Her presence In the hunt did not lessen the impact of it at all. it was sick and evil. just because a girl who is anything but normal was along for it dosent make it any less worse.
1932	Beric175	2014-04-19	If anything, it suggests that Ramsay played the girls against each other for giggles, knowing full well where it would go so he's actually even less sympathetic because he did not pull this stuff in the books. I suspect that the rocky relationship with Roose is close to the books,Â seeing as Ramsay is literally the only heir Roose has at this stage and so he has to take him in, when previously he jokingly sent him smelly Reek as companion just for a laugh and generally did not give a shit about him.Â
1933	Hath4	2014-04-19	I think tansy was probably just an innocent girl who was forced into a relationship with ramsay knowing full well what would happen if he said no. So she did what he said figuring she would be safe that way, but in the end she was not. Myranda is different she is actually into sadism and is a psychopath. That's why he has taken her as his hunting partner. Ramsay gravitas towards people who Share his mindset.

Â 
If what you say is true, then Tansy could be a substitute for Lady of Harenhall, who was married off to Ramsey, and whom he tortured and killed by denying her food until she chewed off her own fingers. Just a way to show Ramsey is the sadist in every relationship.

1937	Russellstiltskin	2014-04-27	I felt like the scene did a lot to show us Ramsay's motivations: hurting and torturing people, having a very violent and cruel (not to mention psychotic) form of fun when he's not brooding, torturing, or trying to impress Roose.Â  A scene like that showed some of the other things depicted in books but not in GoT...It fleshes out Ramsay's character, as well do the other scenes, especially the one when Roose and Walda return.Â  And, of course, for time's sake, she may be used as a plot device, masking one character for her or one of Ramsay's other dirty deeds with him tormenting her.
1938	Talking Hodor	2014-06-04	He'll torture her once he's tired of her.Â  Ever wonder whose blood was all over him when he went into the dungeon to rescue Reek from his rescuers?Â  Next time we see him, he'll have a dog named Miranda.

Â But why I say it's positive is because of theÂ impact. Â The fact thatÂ thatÂ was essentially Joffrey's last act is brilliant. Â Yes, we saw him being an asshole to Tyrion as well. Â Quite a bit. Â But that one bit of the jousting was sadistic and cruel and salt in the wounds and everything we hate about Joffrey and we see it played out on Sansa's face beautifully... Â And we have that seething hatred for Joffrey and overwhelming sympathy for Sansa fueling us when Joffrey starts choking.
Â 
I'm just.. Â I'm so happy that we saw him truly being aÂ monster this episode, in addition to being just a fucking asshole.

He looks so helpless and a lot younger than he did throughout the rest of the episode, imo... Â Great expression and make-up and cgi all around. Â
1970	Scrambled Aegon	2014-04-13	Â 
Ah! Â I can't wait to see that on the re-watch. Â Varys is always my favorite character to watch in the background.


Or in the foreground.
1971	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-13	Regime change breakfast boar.
"TANSY!! TANSY!!!"
Shireen being all <.< at Melisandre.
Bran's vision was OooOoooOo
The entire wedding was amazing and awesome.
1972	modbelle	2014-04-13	- Loras being SassyThis so much. Loras's scene with Jaime is probably one of my favorite scenes with him even though it was short. That's right, you tell Jaime you know what is what. Seriously, I found Loras glorious in this episode and my eyes were straying to him even when he was a background character.Sansa getting the cup for Tyrion. It was such a sweet "we are in this together thing." Personally, I love Sophie Turner's acting as Sansa and she is one of the main reasons that I like Show!Sansa better than Book!Sansa. I blame her eyes that showthe depths of her misery, and make me want to protect her and sic a direwolf on her enemies.I thought it made the scene more powerful that Jaime was the first to reach Joffrey dying, and that both of his real parents were essentially holding him. Also, I got the vibes Jaime was like oh no I can't protect the KING, while Cersei was more about my SON. It was this beautiful cruel disconnect. Great death scene.I love Charles Dance.
1973	shiola	2014-04-13	This so much. Loras's scene with Jaime is probably one of my favorite scenes with him even though it was short. That's right, you tell Jaime you know what is what. Seriously, I found Loras glorious in this episode and my eyes were straying to him even when he was a background character.
Â 


Â 
Loras is growing on me more and more with every scene! Â He was one of my favorite parts of this week.
Â 


Sansa getting the cup for Tyrion. It was such a sweet "we are in this together thing." Personally, I love Sophie Turner's acting as Sansa and she is one of the main reasons that I like Show!Sansa better than Book!Sansa. I blame her eyes that showthe depths of her misery, and make me want to protect her and sic a direwolf on her enemies.


Â 
Well said. Â She's such a sweetheart, despite everything. Â And that's what breaks my heart about her. Â Poor Little Bird...
Â 



I thought it made the scene more powerful that Jaime was the first to reach Joffrey dying, and that both of his real parents were essentially holding him. Also, I got the vibes Jaime was like oh no I can't protect the KING, while Cersei was more about my SON. It was this beautiful cruel disconnect. Great death scene.
Â 


Â 
I didn't even think of it like that. Â Awesome insight. Â Definitely shows the difference between them, and their priorities.
1974	Ramsay Gimp	2014-04-13	And of course Ramsay and Locke, two sadists, would be pals.


Â 
Sadistic hunters, I alwasy suspected they would be friends.
1975	yushkevitch	2014-04-13	Â 
Absolutely. Â Alfie is one of many true talents in this cast. Â He amazes me with almost every scene. Â He lets us get inside of Theon's head and feel emotions we don't want to feel for a character we don't want to feel them for. Â Brilliant.


Â 
I'm actually of the (almost) opposite opinion. I haven't been a big fan of his acting in the series at all, but I will concede he was spot on this episode.
1976	ebevan91	2014-04-13	Lena Headey was great in this episode. Though I do think she should've screamed or whatever Cersei did in the book.
1977	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-13	Â

Yes. I first thought it hella awkward Jaime was even in this whole thing until that moment. It all made sense during that moment. Ung thats good shit.
1978	andrew_	2014-04-13	Loved the make-up/effects on Joffrey's face as he died, brace yourselves for the Joffrey is dead meme's.
1979	go joff go	2014-04-13	I love that they successfully made the scene a whodunnit
1980	shiola	2014-04-13	I love that they successfully made the scene a whodunnit


Â 
Yes! Â I'm watching some non-readers speculate. It's good fun. :]
1981	sansatyrell	2014-04-13	Spoiler I loved Brienne's interaction with both Margaery and Cersei. I need more of both dynamics in my life asap. I don't care for brienne and jaime's relationship (whatever it may be) but I LOVE cersei being jealous. Can't wait for more Brienne
1982	Corvinus	2014-04-13	the purple, the purple! and of course the missing amethyst.
1983	Ian of Asshai	2014-04-13	- Varys getting smacked in the back of the head, and the look of utter annoyance that follows. (The Grand Maester got thwacked too I believe. But its funnier happening to Verys.)
Â 
- Melisandre keeping up appearances by sitting with Stannis the Mannis and Selyse at dinner. Followed by her visit to Shireen. "Afterwards they are filled with Joy." Â "Afterwards they aren't ash and bone."
Â 
- Â Cersei's interaction with Brienne, and Jamie's interaction with Loras which mirrored it.
Â 
- The Queen of Thorns in everything she does. It's a shame we couldn't get "The Serpent's Whore." Maybe in another episode? Still glad to get the interaction with Sansa. Also glad Dontos was the one to urge Sansa off once shit started going down.
- Oberyn and Ellaria in everything they do. Love the Dornish. Ballsy motherf*ckers. "Former Queen Regent." Â "Lady Cersei." You can just tell it irks the shit out of her.
Â 
-Bran and Bloodraven coming ever closer to one another.
1984	Harry Lime	2014-04-13	The little details, like the Stannis dwarf "riding" on a Melisandre dummy, made this episode.
Â 
Well, that and the obvious scene.
1985	shiola	2014-04-13	I forgot to add.. Â There's some sort of exotic dancer/flexible sort of lady as part of the entertainment in a brief shot of the wedding. Â Podrick does like a quadruple take and just stares at her. Â I'm actually fond of the Podrick & Whores backstory. Â It's good for a chuckle.
1986	ohpooratlas	2014-04-13	Couple things I loved off the top of my head ...
Â 
+ Everything Bolton related. It was golden. Alfie's doing such a wonderful job as Reek.Â 
+ Loved that the beginning of the Bran scene where they talk about how it's important he not forget himself in the wolf was lifted right out of the books.
+ "You'll never marry her." "And neither will you." BURN.
+ Everything. With. Oberyn. Martell. Is. Gold.
+ Lena Headey was in fine form tonight. I forget how fantastic she is sometimes.
+ Completely superficial but loved Marg's dress.
+ Sophie was golden as well. She conveys so much without even saying a word.
+ I loved that the episode had me on the edge of my seat for the last twenty minutes or so.
1987	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-13	I forgot to add.. Â There's some sort of exotic dancer/flexible sort of lady as part of the entertainment in a brief shot of the wedding. Â Podrick does like a quadruple take and just stares at her. Â I'm actually fond of the Podrick & Whores backstory. Â It's good for a chuckle.


My favorite is when Oberyn and Ellaria stop at that contortionist.
1988	WTF's a Lommy	2014-04-13	Olenna telling Mace that adults are talking.
1989	Queen Sansa Stark	2014-04-13	Sansa's and Tyrion's wtf? faces after Joffrey graciously takes the gift. Absolutely hilarious.Â  
Â 
The contrasting reaction of Sansa and Loras on the "war of the five kings" act. Both saw how the people they loved being mocked and degraded. Loras couldn't stomach it and walked away whereas Sansa forced herself to watch it and didn't even flinch. Great illustration of her inner strength.Â  
Â 
Absolutely loved the Terminator line of DontosÂ  Â  
Â 
Every single thing Oberyn saidÂ   you call those Lannisters out man.

1990	Mladen	2014-04-13	1. Sansa... Come on people... This was almost as difficult as RW...
Â 
2. Ellaria's dress... My God, when I saw it, my jaw dropped...
Â 
3. Loras and Jaime & Loras and Oberyn... Loras was the man of the night...
Â 
Everything was overall good, but my God, that Ellaria's dress... She should never go to another wedding... That dress was way too rude...
1991	GoldenHand at SnowCastle	2014-04-13	This so much. Loras's scene with Jaime is probably one of my favorite scenes with him even though it was short. That's right, you tell Jaime you know what is what. Seriously, I found Loras glorious in this episode and my eyes were straying to him even when he was a background character.

The Jaime vs Cersei part, exactly.
Â 
Good pick! It shows how different they really are.Â
1992	Seneti	2014-04-13	Where do I begin?
Â 
On Dragonstone:
- Shireen's conversation with Melisandre. She is such a sweet and smart child.
- Stannis' undying love for his daughter and wife (judging from the story Selyse was telling)
- Stannis looking like a caged rat surrounded by religious fanatics
Â 
At the Dreadfort:
- Ramsay's hunt (poor Tansy)
- Theon's reaction to hearing that Robb's dead
- Roose burning Ramsay
- Fat Walda seems really sweet and nice
Â 
North of the Wall:
- the don't-get-lost-in-the-wolf conversation
- Bran's vision, which I'm dying to take apart frame by frame once it's on youtube
Â 
KL pre-wedding:
- the conversation between Tyrion and Jaime, particularly the part where Tyrion spills his wine on purpose as a gesture of sibling solidarity
- Joffrey thanking Tyrion for the book and then promptly destroying it with his sword
- Bronn and Jaime sparring
- Tyrion breaking up with Shae for good was as heart-wrenching as it ought to be
Â 
KL during the wedding:
- Margaery's dress
- Olenna comforting Sansa (watch Sansa closely!)
- Tyrion keeping his cool in spite of Joffrey's barrage of insults
- Margaery's constant annoyance at Joff's behaviour
- Cersei backstabbing Margaery by reversing her orders
- Oberyn burning Cersei (Lady Cersei... ouch) and reminding her that they still have her daughter
- Loras burning Jaime
- the joust (which, appropriately, was almost too painful to watch)
- the blink-and-you-miss-it shot of the dove that didn't make it out of the pie
- Jack Gleeson's acting in his final scene
1993	averde	2014-04-13	The whole Roose/ Ramsay scene was fantastic and everything I hoped for.
1994	bobbybuilderton	2014-04-13	I found it kind of funny that Ramsay chose to prove that Theon is broken by saying "I want you to hold this blade to my throat while I tell you someone you cared about is dead." I found it funny because there are probably other ways to make a point but he's so crazy.Â 
Â 
Also, Locke and Ramsay being friends was touching in a weird, morbid, disturbing way. Seemed like he was a kind of "cool uncle" to him or something.
1995	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-04-13	I love that Joffrey died thinking that Tyrion was the one responsible.
1996	go joff go	2014-04-13	Â 
Yes! Â I'm watching some non-readers speculate. It's good fun. :]not only that but if you went back and did a rewatch of the first three seasons, you would find that a lot of characters made very suspicious comments in retrospect.
1997	bobbybuilderton	2014-04-13	OOH OH and when Tyrion sends Shae away...I don't care for Shae or the actress playing her but that was still pretty sad.
Â 

	Spoiler I ALSO liked Tywin saying to have her brought to the tower of the hand. Dat foreshadowing doe. I have to rewatch though to make sure that's what he said, because the sound where I was watching wasn't too great.
1998	DogLover	2014-04-14	Fat Walda! Loras owning Jaime with his "Neither will you" comment. The dynamic between Roose and Ramsey. Oberyn cutting down Cersei. Loved this episode!
1999	Nictarion	2014-04-14	I absolutely loved Bran's scene with the Weirwood tree, easily my favorite scene of the episode.
Â 
Roose putting Ramsay in his place was good too.
2000	shiola	2014-04-14	not only that but if you went back and did a rewatch of the first three seasons, you would find that a lot of characters made very suspicious comments in retrospect.


Â 
Yes. Â I have seen each season numerous times. Â The foreshadowing is so blatant in retrospect... I love it.
2001	RoamingRonin	2014-04-14	Catching the repeat now and I'm already happy Tyrion and Jaime have a scene together.Â 
Â 

	Spoiler In the books, the last time they talk is over breakfast at Winterfell. I thought this was very odd because Jaime was totally there in King's Landing to talk to Tyrion before Tyrion is sent to the Black Cells.

Â 
In regards to the whole "Show before the books":
Â 

	Spoiler We're in fifth book already with Ramsay and Roose!

Â Podrick does like a quadruple take and just stares at her. Â I'm actually fond of the Podrick & Whores backstory. Â It's good for a chuckle.
She was present when Tyrion "paid" Pod back for saving him at Black Water.  
She was described as being one of only few who could properly perform a Mereneese knot....
Good catch
2003	TheNorth's1stKnight	2014-04-14	locke talking to ramsey about cutting off jaime's handÂ
2004	shiola	2014-04-14	She was present when Tyrion "paid" Pod back for saving him at Black Water.
She was described as being one of only few who could properly perform a Mereneese knot....
Good catch


Â 
Yes, I thought it was her!
2005	Newstar	2014-04-14	Dwarf joust in the show was a vast improvement on the books. Really clever.
Â 
Loved Sansa's defiant "Fuck you" look at Joffrey as she retrieved the goblet for Tyrion. AMAZING.
Â 
The dialogue was everything, especially Loras' mic-dropping "And neither will you" moment with Jaime and Oberyn's pointed repartee with Tywin and Cersei.

2006	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-14	I love how Lady Olenna took every chance she got to call the Lannisters cheap.
2007	shiola	2014-04-14	Gotta love the shout-out to the Iron Bank
2008	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-14	Sansa - Sophie has what, 2 lines for the entire episode? And knocked it out of the park
Â 
Tyrion/Shea - I was actually interested in their engagement for the first time in a long time.
Â 
Boltons - I nice set up I feel. Ramsay wanting recognition... and knowing how to get it.
Â 
Loras - with a couple of moments that did him justice finally.

Â 
Yeah! i don't know why it got me excited. it's like a part of me inside was like "HEY I KNOW THAT THING THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT!"
Â 
I loved the Oberyn scene, dude is killing it so far. Joff's final scene was great. Loved the Roose/Ramsay scene and especially loved Alfie's acting, it's great.The Jaime/Bronn Jaime/Loras were both great scenes also.
2010	lostinwesteros	2014-04-14	Â Loved Sansa's defiant "Fuck you" look at Joffrey as she retrieved the goblet for Tyrion. AMAZING.
Â 

Yes!  I've always said Sansa couldn't even begin to survive the brutal experiences Arya has, but this episode in particular really underscored how very brutal are the experiences she's surviving in KL.  Not that being forced to look at her father's head on a stake wasn't brutal, but now we see her strength and endurance, not just her horror.  Just beautiful on the part of the character and the actor!
And I really liked the care and empathy btw Sansa and Tyrion.
2011	voodooqueen126	2014-04-14	I thought Sophie Turner's acting was superb. My how I loved the curtailed anger on her face during the Dwarf Jousting scene.
2012	bobbybuilderton	2014-04-14	Cersei's reaction to Brienne bowing instead of doing curtsy was so perfect. She's such an asshole. I didn't realize why she found that so hilarious until Brienne mentioned never learning to curtsy properly.
Â 
AAAAAND Bear and the Maiden Fair playing at the wedding feast was pretty great.

					
					
							Edited by bobbybuilderton, 14 April 2014 - 01:15 AM.
2013	Darkbringer	2014-04-14	Liked the cold loathing that Roose shows Ramsey as Ramsey tries to win his respect.
Â 
Dwarf jousting- excellent.Â 
Â 
Reek is properly broken.
Â 
Sansa is doing well and getting some courage.Â
2014	The Lady Leela	2014-04-14	Fat Walda was just positively adorable.Â
2015	lizziebeth	2014-04-14	Loved this episode!
Â 
At the Dreadfort:
- Ramsay's hunt: fantastically done. I'm interested in the addition of Miranda as a secondary psychopath in this storyline.
- Ramsey and Roose- Love the dynamic between these two.Â  You're not a Bolton, you're a Snow.Â  I also love that they showed Fat Walda!
- Theon's descent into Reek is heart breaking.Â  Watching him shave Ramsey, having a sharp blade literally at Ramsey's throat while Ramsey tells him about Robb's death and Reek just keeps on shaving him after a moment's hesitation. That is a broken man.
Â 
King's Landing pre-wedding:
-Tyrion and Jamie- A nice little glimpse of some brotherly affection between the two at breakfast. Also the great line about a cripple, a dwarf and mother to madness. Perfect summary of the Lannister children.
Â 
-Bran - I'm so excited to see where this storyline goes. The vision hints at great things coming.Â  I also like the warning about not staying in the wolf for too long.
Â 
The Purple Wedding:Â 
- Margaery's dress is gorgeous and dangerous. Roses do have thorns after all. I also really like Joff's new crown with the roses intwinedÂ  in the stag horns.Â  Quite an interesting bit of symbolism.
- shout out to the Iron Bank
- Rains of Castamere played
- Olenna's snark gives me life. Calling the Lannisters cheap, that comment about killing people at a wedding.
- Oberyn and Ellaria are definitely the best new additions this season. Appreciaiting the contortionist, Oberyn making eyes at Loras, the balls of steel it took to threaten Tywin and mock Cersei
- Cersei was in fine form throughout the wedding: Giving the leftovers to the dogs instead of the poor, mocking Brienne for bowing instead of a curtsy,
- Loras' snark to Jaime.Â  I love Jaime, but i actually laughed out loud at Loras getting the last word
- The joust - SO well done.Â  I actually prefer this version to the book.Â  The details in the costumes there are great: Stannis riding the red woman (and the wildfire bit), Renly riding Loras, Balon on the kracken, and the lion with stag horns for Joffrey.Â  Sansa's expression made me almost cry when Robb's wolf head was knocked off.Â  Watching the expressions of some of the other characters to this is quite interesting too. I need to rewatch again to try to catch other things I missed the first watch.
- New Tommen-Â  I'm interested to see how he develops as a character. He does look the part of a Lannister, blond and pretty.
- The much anticipated death.Â  I like the way this was filmed, it leaves a real mystery as to who could've done it as the camera was focused on the pie and doves. The tension leading up to that moment was perfect as well. Joff's last act before he died was pointing at Tyrion.
- Dontos telling Sansa she needs to leave right now if she wants to live.
2016	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-14	I'm glad that they managed to pull off Joff's death with a mixture of "Oh my god it's happening!" and repulsion. Just like in the books, I wanted to cheer - but the whole scene is so damn uncomfortable that it ultimately just doesn't feel that satisfying. Cersei's reaction... Lena was brilliant. I loved that imagery of both Jaime and Cersei, Joff's actual parents, holding him in his final moments.
Â 
Everything at KL was fantastic. Oh man, still trying to recover from it.
2017	The Killer Snark	2014-04-14	Jack Gleeson was fantastic. I was underwhelmed by the episode overall, but let's hope he continues acting after this, because his performance in this was straight off of the pages of the book.
2018	Roose Boltons Pet Leech	2014-04-14	When Joffrey asks what he should name the sword, you can hear several suggestions: Stormbringer, Terminus Est. Clearly Joffrey invites fantasy geeks to his functions.
2019	Illusive_Man	2014-04-14	Ramsey's hunt.Â  Different from how the hunts end in books, but still terrifying
Â 
Locke and Ramsey little reunion showcasing how twisted these characters are
Â 
Reek shaving Ramsey while learning of Robb's death.Â  You can in eye that he wants to kill Ramsey, but in his head is "Reek rythmes with weak"
Â 
Iron Bank
Â 
Dwarf jousting.Â  The look of pain and disgust from so many characters while Joffrey laughing his ass off.Â  Wonderfully played.
Â 
Sansa helping Tyrion, and finding a true connection with him.Â  She saw that he was going through almost the same thing as she did for all that time.Â 
Â 
Joffrey's death ever so brutal and all the effects for the blood and the eyes
Â 
Tyrion looking at the cup trying to see what had just happened, confused.Â 
Â 
Overall a great episode.
2020	Pod The Impaler	2014-04-14	I really liked Bran's vision.
Â 
I liked Ramsay's little hunt (well maybe not "liked" - but it got the point across about Ramsay.).
Â 
Theon's face finding about Robb was great - go Reek !
Â 
Cersei threatening Pycelle to make him leave and at the same time denying food to the poor. She has this down to a science.
Â 
Sansa's reaction during the jousting, her most of all.
Â - In fact, let me give kudos to all the actors during the jousts, since they achieved half of them looking thrilled, and half like they were politely appalled
Â 
Shireen giving some back-talk to Melisandre.
Â 
Kudos to Jack Gleeson for making Joffrey so relentlessly hateable right to the episode conclusion.

2021	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-14	The Dreadfort scenes were great, and that chase scene was so brutal. Loved the interaction between Roose, Ramsay and Locke. Alfie is killing it as Reek. That look in his eyes when he hears that Robb is dead... so sad.
Â 
I thought the dinner scene between Mel, Stannis and Selyse was pretty funny. I liked Shireen sticking it to Mel, also.Â 
Â 
Can't wait for more sparring between Bronn and Jaime. Loved Jaime being all like "You're not supposed to hit me before I pick up my sword!" while Bronn toys with him, haha.

2022	The Kinkslayer	2014-04-14	The jousting was awesome!!!Â
2023	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-14	Props to Sigur Ros, also. Nice little cameo, and a haunting rendtion of Rains of Castamere to bow Joffrey out.
2024	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-14	The Shireen/Mel scene.
Â 
The best thing about this scene was it put to bed all the ridiculous spitballers who were adamant it was Yara in that promo.
2025	The Kinkslayer	2014-04-14	Jack Gleeson was fantastic. I was underwhelmed by the episode overall, but let's hope he continues acting after this, because his performance in this was straight off of the pages of the book.


He was more courteous than book Joff, he never told Tyrion "You owe me a present uncle, this book is cut in half", and the thing with the dragonbone dagger
Â 


Loved the make-up/effects on Joffrey's face as he died, brace yourselves for the Joffrey is dead meme's.


Knowing that Joff was going to died I just stared at Cersei's cleavage .
2026	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-14	I thought Joffrey's death was done superbly. Dying with Jaime as well as Cersei was an excellent touch, but the chilling shot of his face at the end and The Rains of Castamere rendition added to the whole atmosphere.
Â 
Theon's scene with Ramsay where Ramsay told him Robb was dead was excellent. Made me feel a bit sorry for Theon when it happened.
2027	sati	2014-04-14	I loved so many things but Stannis hilarious expressions (http://littlesati.tu...nd-the-rose-the ) and that line about Shireen (I really like how concerned he is with her in the show) were great.
2028	Maria Underfoot	2014-04-14	I loved the dwarf scene, and mostly the acting of people affected by it. (Sansa, Loras, Tyrion, evenÂ Oberyn.)
IÂ  also think that Gwendoline Christie is awesome and underrated. Though I have a few reservations about the scene with Cersei (but hey, they were written by GRRM), her reactions were perfect, her posture conveyed all that awkwardness that Brienne experiences in a dress.
Oberyn is awesome too. "Maybe in some places the raping and murdering of innocent women is considered distasteful" is a great line.
2029	Ingelheim	2014-04-14	Roose, Ramsay, Reek and Locke scene. Pure brilliant.
2030	SerJeremiahLouistark	2014-04-14	I thought it was cool seeing Ned in Bran's vision, and the first person dire wolf scene was cool too. The death of the inbred was awesome, and everything Oberyn does is fantastic.
2031	Jamie Lannister	2014-04-14	I loved that 5-second friendship scene between Ramsay and Locke. Roose has a great dynamic with his son too.

Â 
Agreed. I know some are complaining that she should have wailed, but I loved the "in shock and denial" reaction; and especially how venomous Cersei was when she looked at Tyrion. She literally spat at the guards to seize him.
2036	Jojosh	2014-04-14	It was especially cruel that Joffrey decided not just to mock Tyrion but Loras and Sansa as well with the dwarf jousting.Â

2037	Janicia	2014-04-14	I enjoyed Melisandre's expressions during the awkward dinner scene. Â It really seemed like she wished both Stannis and Selyse would get their heads on straight, and that until they did she wished they would stop inviting her to dinner. Â
2038	lostinasia	2014-04-14	Jamie calling his son Joffrey. Has that ever happened before?
Â 
"the-fuck's-position" replacing sexposition? Last week we had Hound-as-viewer with "What the fuck's a Lommy?" This week we had Locke-as-viewer with "Who the fuck's Jon Snow?" (Although I really hope that last question isn't necessary for even the dimmest of viewers.) Maybe next week we'll have "Who the fuck's Daenerys?" to sort out the Khaleesi/Dany confusion.
Â 
Stormbringer! Maybe Elric will turn out to be the Great Other.
Â 
Finding out that Jamie knew he would no longer be a good fighter. Last week I had the impression he just hadn't clued in yet, which could also have worked, but I like how this week he demonstrated that Tyrion's the only person he trusts with that kind of information. Good to see their relationship re-established after, what, three seasons without dialogue between the two of them?
Â 
Horror/amusement at the opening hunting scene: "happy" that they're making Ramsey a true monster now. Yes, he was of course a monster to Theon last season, but that could have been seen as karmically justified. And amused at that scene because I knew how the episode was going to end: "Hm, they're really trying to set up a new villain, aren't they? Gee, I wonder why that would be necessary?"
Â 
Roose speaking about Theon/Reek in the third person. "This was Balon Greyjoy's son and heir." Cold.
Â 
Dontos's hat. WTF was that?! He looked like a muppet popping up beside Sansa. In a good way.
Â 
Love Brienne's face in reaction to Cersei. Cersei's not sure what it means (well, she thinks she knows, but she's probably wrong, because she's Cersei), and Brienne's not sure what she's thinking, and most of the viewers in the forum don't seem sure either. I think only Gwendolyn Christie knows. Love it when acting can be wonderfully ambiguous like that.
Â 
The fact that both episodes thus far have basically ended with the same emotional arc for the viewer:
Â 
"Yeah! Go Arya! Go Starks! Woo hoo! ... Oh, wait ... Uh, I'm not sure if I should be enjoying this ... OK, I'm cheering for a sweet little girl becoming a sociopathic killer ... that's not right."
Â 
"Yeah! F*ck you, Joffrey! That's some vengeance! ... Oh, wait ... Uh, I'm not sure if I should be enjoying this ... OK, I'm cheering for a teenager who's bleeding out of every facial orifice and turning all kinds of weird colours ... that's not right."
Â 
The TV show is giving us just what we think we want, and then making us wonder if we really should have wanted it. Sort of like what GRRM did with Arya and Sansa. Well, without the constant risk of death.
2039	King Zee	2014-04-14	The Shireen/Mel scene.
Â 
The best thing about this scene was it put to bed all the ridiculous spitballers who were adamant it was Yara in that promo.


Â 
yup yup.
2040	Harry Lime	2014-04-14	Also, I have to give props to Sibel's acting in this episode. She gets such a disproportionate amount of hatred for her acting skills, but I think she nailed the crying scene.

2043	The Abominable SnowOther	2014-04-14	The Jaime and Tyrion scene was fantastic
#bro's4life
Â 
Very first likeable thing about Jaime in the books is his relationship with Tyrion. We dont have many of those moments in the books
2044	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-04-14	I loved the dwarf scene, and mostly the acting of people affected by it. (Sansa, Loras, Tyrion, evenÂ Oberyn.)
IÂ  also think that Gwendoline Christie is awesome and underrated. Though I have a few reservations about the scene with Cersei (but hey, they were written by GRRM), her reactions were perfect, her posture conveyed all that awkwardness that Brienne experiences in a dress.
Oberyn is awesome too. "Maybe in some places the raping and murdering of innocent women is considered distasteful" is a great line.


Â 
Agreed and agreed. Â The Renly dwarf really looked like him, and the Joffrey dwarf humping the wolf's head was surprising funny given everything about it was absolutely despicable.
Â 
The Oberyn scene was great all around. Â I love the scenes which have interplay between more than 2 characters, and Oberyn's dialogue and acting are simply phenomenal (a la Syrio Forel, a la Jaqen H'ghar - some characters this show just absolutely nails).
2045	The Abominable SnowOther	2014-04-14	I didn't notice this until I saw this gif. Â Cersei actually pushed Jaime out of the way.

I saw on a neogaf unsullied thread:
http://i.imgur.com/Pp6dDUN.jpg
2047	buckfosto	2014-04-14	I thought the whole episode was great.Â  Originally I was so hoping we were going to get the "Reek/rat" scene as his introduction but the way they did it and illustrated how broken he was was spot on.Â  Alfie Allen is a tremendous actor and Ramsay is just creeptastic.
I loved everything else that people have already mentioned so I'll just add this: I thought watching the faces of those in the crowd not amused by the dwarf jousting was so well done.Â  There were the sycophants and buttkissers to the crown that were laughing and whooping but then you saw Varys, Oberyn, Oleanna...et al watching with this deadly serious look on their faces. I thought that was chilling.
Â 
Oberyn saying hello and then "I wasn't talking to you" and right to the contortionist
OH! and the way Margery would always try to "bring Joffrey around" and divert him was expertly done.Â  As was Tyrion's attempts to play stuff off and Joffrey not taking those hints.

2048	KalibakCruel	2014-04-14	Jack Gleeson was fantastic. I was underwhelmed by the episode overall, but let's hope he continues acting after this, because his performance in this was straight off of the pages of the book.

He's retiring actually.

2050	The_Gallows_Knight	2014-04-14	I loved the Elric of MelnibonA© shoutout.
2051	Onna Lewyys	2014-04-14	Just like how they bookended Ep 1 with the two swords, I love how they bookended this episode with the two psychopaths. I call it "passing the psychopathic torch."I'm glad that they managed to pull off Joff's death with a mixture of "Oh my god it's happening!" and repulsion. Just like in the books, I wanted to cheer - but the whole scene is so damn uncomfortable that it ultimately just doesn't feel that satisfying.

That's how I feel too. It was gruesome. The blood streaming out of his nose was a fantastic addition.
I also loved all of Oberyn's passive aggression and subtle threats against Tywin & Cersei. Not just because it shows how badass he is, but also because 
	Spoiler the references to Myrcella make me much more confident that the Queenmaker plot will not be cut from the show as so many people have long predicted.
2052	BlackTalon	2014-04-14	Did anyone else catch that hilariously awkward bit where Joffrey leers at Margaery's cleavage from the side and she embarrassedly notices it and looks down to check there hasn't been some bridal dress malfunction?

Â 
Omg! Cersei you harpy! Thats...crossing a line in my opinion. Shoving away not only the LC of the Kingsguard but Joff's actual father. Theres concern and theres just being vicious! Wow! Heady kicks ass in this role....So much. "No no! Get away, HES MIIIIINE!!" Is so Cersei.Â 
I also loved all of Oberyn's passive aggression and subtle threats against Tywin & Cersei. Not just because it shows how badass he is, but also because 
	Spoiler the references to Myrcella make me much more confident that the Queenmaker plot will not be cut from the show as so many people have long predicted.

2059	TheKitttenGuard	2014-04-14	In two shots when Joffrey went to ground.  First when Cersei pushed Margaery aside Tywinn moves to Tommen.  When they give a cut to Tyrion, Tywinn is covering Tommen to shield him from whats going on.
2060	Newstar	2014-04-14	Cersei shoving Margaery out of the way was awesome.

Thanks - I totally missed that, and it's a really nice touch in the show. Plus earlier when the [non-cleaved] pigeons fly out of the pie, that's one of the few moments we've ever seen give what seemed like a genuine smile.
Â 
(Actually I think there's a small continuity error there with Tywin: one second he's on the dais, with his hand over Tommen's face, and a few seconds later he's in the crowd around Joffrey.)
Â 
The Elric of MelnibonA© nod: when someone in the crowd shouts "Stormbringer!" as a sword name suggestion.
2065	TheKitttenGuard	2014-04-14	Lostinasia,
 They did a closeup shot with Tywinn to put him outside the canopy. Not long but it shows him with the clear sky.
2066	lostinasia	2014-04-14	They did a closeup shot with Tywinn to put him outside the canopy. Not long but it shows him with the clear sky.


I think that's the continuity error (?) I'm talking about - Tywin's with Tommen, and then suddenly he's outside the canopy with blue sky, glaring at Tyrion when Cersei makes her accusation.
Â 
Anyway, not a big deal - can easily be explained away by having Tywin tell someone to get Tommen out of there. I still love that Tywin was being his hyper-aware self AND actually being a good grandparent for a few seconds. Now I really want to know whose idea it was for him to shield Tommen - GRRM? D&D? Dance himself?
2067	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-14	Oberyn with his pointed quips at Cersei - especially the 'Bastards are born of passion' and 'some places look down on bastards... how fortunate Myrcella isn't there'
Â 
Â 


Also, I have to give props to Sibel's acting in this episode. She gets such a disproportionate amount of hatred for her acting skills, but I think she nailed the crying scene.


Â 
Yeah some people hate the characterisation and just lash out every time. I think this whole scene was quite well done. Tyrion lashing out mirrored Drogon from Ep1. I normally hate hand-cam motion because it has been so over used elsewhere but it was perfect here. I really bought that Shea finally realised she wasn't going to get her own way any more and was out of there. I think it would have worked just as well as if they didn't have the pointless love story on her behalf though. I don't blame anyone for cringing every time the two of them are together - this is the first time in years I have actually liked one of their scenes.
2068	channamasala	2014-04-14	- loved Bran warging (? is that what we call it?) with the tree, and how he struggled with it at first. The dragon over King's Landing in a quick vision. Good set-up. Although I felt the rest of that scene was a little weak.Â 
Â 
- loved Sansa in every scene, her face and her kindness to Tyrion
Â 
- loved the razor scene
Â 
- loved Podrick looking back at that woman doing a Meereenese Knot (?) who looked like she might've been flashing some undercarriage (I think it was really tight fabric, though).Â 
Â 
- loved the way Joff said "I pledge my love", in a way that only a teenager who doesn't know how to say "love" would awkwardly drop that word
Â 
- love Joff's "Look I cut the pie with my Valyrian sword" show-off, like any idiot couldn't cut a pie with a Valyrian sword.
Â 
- loved Olenna - especially her handsy-ness with Sansa and how quick-fingered she is.Â 
Â 
- loved the Dornish - in the book I felt some of their cultural stuff didn't come across as interestingly, the show really brings the whole people to life. I am way more interested in show Oberyn than I was in book Oberyn.
Â 
- loved the mean-a** barbs everyone threw at each other - like a difficult family at a real wedding!Â 
Â 
- loved Socially Awkward Brienne (I know others didn't, but I felt I really got the point of how she just didn't know how to comport herself as a "lady" and that showed more strongly in KL than in the Westerosi countryside
Â 
- loved most of Cersei - her need for power, not knowing what to do when she gets it, and then going NUTS-O when she's losing it, giving weird commands like "feed the leftovers to the dogs". Stroking her own ego even when it does nobody, not even herself, any good. I even love her understated reaction to Joff's death - rather than the show having the two mothers compete with dueling screams, it's more of a comparison between the two women.
Â 
- loved Tywin not throwing barbs back at people who are blatantly insulting him, it shows how much power he thinks he has that he need not stoop to their level
Â 
- loved how it's really obvious that a lot of those wedding guests just aren't THAT smart. I mean, Joffrey hates Tyrion and Tyrion was holding the cup, of course Joff'd point at Tyrion as the killer. That doesn't mean anything, and a smarter person would see that (possibly a few guests do, like Varys, but they're too smart to show it) and realize he likely wasn't, in fact, the killer.Â 
Â 
- loved Margaery's easy, winning personality (a cultivated trait, but still a trait). How she distracts, wins people over, says the right things at the right time and shuts up at the right time. She actually would have made a pretty darn good queen, scheming or no.
Â 
- loved most of Tyrion's role, my only bad nitpick (sorry) was I felt his spiel about Joff'sÂ 
"bravery" on the Blackwater went on too long (longer than his signature quick, brief wit) and was a bit wooden. But maybe that was on purpose, to better disguise the insults within.

Widows's Wail > Stormbringer in Joffrey's eyes because it implies human pain and suffering.

Â 
One scene sticks out as it made me laugh out loud and my husband wondered what was so funny. It was when straight from the Ramsay/Roose/Reek scene, after Ramsay had told his father what he had done to Theon, it then cut scene to Tyrion forking a large sausage onto his plate while having breakfast with Jaime.Â

"the-fuck's-position" replacing sexposition? Last week we had Hound-as-viewer with "What the fuck's a Lommy?" This week we had Locke-as-viewer with "Who the fuck's Jon Snow?" (Although I really hope that last question isn't necessary for even the dimmest of viewers.) Maybe next week we'll have "Who the fuck's Daenerys?" to sort out the Khaleesi/Dany confusion.


Â 
I think they were trying to explain the "Snow means bastard" thing as subtely as possible- the Unsullied I watched it with was a little confused about Ramsay and Jon having the same last name.
Â 
Joffrey's face as he died- I luckily don't know what watching someone choke to death is like, but I imagine it looks just like that.

They were definitely trying to bring forth the bastard names a little more in the episode, with Snow and Sand.
2079	HelenaExMachina	2014-04-15	I thought Selyse was delightfully fanatical and batty.
The camera rather frequently flitting to Varys during the wedding was a nice touch. Especially his "stony faced" expression.

Â 
Everything Sansa
Â 
Shireen
Â 
I also enjoyed the scene b/n Tyrion and Jaime - the brotherly bonding and the nice touch of Tyrion spilling his wine on purpose. Â Kind of a counterpoint to Joffrey spilling his on Tyrion. One spill done for love, the other for hate. Â I also really enjoyed Loras' comeback remark to Jaime.Â
2081	robdavies1775	2014-04-15	Varys getting bonked on the head.


Â 
Yes. But you're phrasing of it increases its comedic value tenfold!Â
2082	Dornish Hen	2014-04-15	In my first rewatch, I noticed how a lot of the characters are eating in their scenes. Â I thought it was an interesting way to foreshadow the Joffrey's choking death. Â Tyrion is eating when he is speaking with Jaime, Stannis and family are dining together (even if it is "off" meat), Summer is eating, and even Bran is snacking. Â 
Â 
Then, Joffrey takes a bite of his pigeon pie...
2083	alienlefay	2014-04-15	I loved the way Selyse suggested Melisandre should have a talk with Shireen, almost as if Mel was some sort of boogy man that scares kids when theyÂ disrespect R'hllor don't eat. And Melisandre's reaction, she seemed truly surprised. Loved it.

Â 
I really loved Nathalie Dormer's acting.Â
2085	Floop	2014-04-15	I loved this episode.
Â 
Where to start...
Â 
First, something that we've all been waiting for a very long time happened, and that scene and the scenes leading up to it were executed perfectly.
Â 
The scene with Loras and Jaime was great.
Â 
The scene with Brienne and Cersei was intriguing.
Â 
The scene with Tyrion and Shae was true to their relationship on the show and was quite powerful.
Â 
There was a good amount of Varys!
Â 
They found a way to give Bronn more screentime (the sparring with Jaime).
Â 
Sigor Ros getting coins thrown at them at the wedding until they scurried off was brilliant. That they then scrambled around and picked up the coins was inspired. Oh - and they were playing the notorious "Rains of Castamere!"
Â 
Everything I wanted to be there from the books was there and was fantastic, and every minor change or invented scene for the show was top notch. Even the torture porn at the beginning was stomachable due to Theon's excellent performance.
Â 
Funny, exciting, powerful, eventful - this was a stand out episode.

Â 
Brienne is a lady, yet she dresses, fights, talks, even bows like a man.Â  That has to get under Cersei's skin in a very frustrating way.Â  Not only that, she actually gets to travel, alongside Jaime no less.

2089	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-04-16	I love how I just realized that Cersei is jealous of Brienne.Â  I thought it was really mean how she lashed out at her, which is nothing new.Â  However the more I think about it, Brienne must represent something to Cersei, something she wishes she could be.Â

Â 
That's why I thought she made those comments to her and went out of her way to be rude to Brienne. It was very obvious that she was jealous. Brienne has a certain freedom that Cersei doesn't have.
2090	Angmar	2014-04-16	I loved this episode. 
Â 
The ending with the Rains of Castamere was perfect. I was wishing for the song to start playing right after Joffrey died and during Tyrion's arrest, but over the credits is just as good.Â 
Â 
Bran's vision, all of it.

Stannis' dinner. Seemed like an awkward family dinner. And Selyse's talk about the seagulls,,,hah!

2093	Three sisters	2014-04-16	You have the wrong thread, this is the positive nitpicking thread 


Thanks for mentioning. I removed the post because of spoilers. Sorry!
2094	SlowLoras	2014-04-16	Watched this ep with my Unsullied husband and I was really impressed at the way the show set up a whole host of potential suspects. The moments before Joffrey's fateful drinkypoos was an exercise in showing as many disgruntled, potentially murderous characters as possible. He went away spouting theories and being thoroughly confused and I was rubbing my little primate hands in glee.
Â 
I also loved Varys getting bonked on the head, Loras eyefucking Oberyn, Sigur Ros not only playing music but getting Joffrey'd, and the guest appearance of the lovely Fat Walda.
2095	Scrambled Aegon	2014-04-16	Don't know whether anyone else has pointed this out - I imagine I'm not the only one who noticed it - but there was a pretty good and subtle reference to the last non-epilogue chapter of ASOS.
Â 

	Spoiler The girl Ramsay was hunting was named Tansy... in the book, of course, Hoster's final words mention "tansy", and we think it's a girl's name, but later - in the Only Cat chapter - we realize that he's remembering Lysa's forced abortion via the tansy herb. Naming that girl Tansy was a nice nod at readers that I enjoyed once I heard her name the second time I watched.

2098	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-04-17	I went back and watched the scene to see Tywin during the wedding since everyone was referencing him shielding Tommen. Oh my goodness, I do not need a reason to actually like Tywin. Â I'm not supposed to like him, but there's Charles Dance playing him, the wonderful banter with Olenna and now this - my heart twinged when I saw that.
2099	Sam with Hooters	2014-04-17	Back to Ramsay, his unexpectedly warm greeting to Fat Walda.Â  But that's how Ramsay works.Â  If anything should happen to Roose, Ramsay will eat Fat Walda alive.

2103	moraga1	2014-04-19	Contrary to general comment I believe that Shireen's scene with Melisandre was the most important of the episode. Â Remember, GRRM wrote the script for The Lion and the Rose and he didn't include that scene has just filler. Â Shireen is after all the legit Crown Princess - I predict she is going to come up huge when all is said and done.
2104	A Man Has Said	2014-04-19	One thing I really enjoyed was the blocking at the purple wedding, as Joffrey went from asshole to flaming asshole to nuclear-powered asshole.
Â 
(Blocking is what actors are doing when they don't have any lines. Usually it's just a matter of not drawing attention to oneself or 'upstaging' the speaker. In this case it's the reactions of non-speakers to the actor 'in the spotlight.')
Â 
You of course expect characters like Tyrion or Sansa to show disgust with practically everything that Joffrey does, just as you expect others like Mace, Olenna and Margaery to show a bit of an undercurrent, but also show that they're trying to be polite for the sake of the occasion and hide most of it. That was VERY well done by all the actors IMO.
Â 
What I really enjoyed though were the looks exchanged between Tywin and Cersei. They start off being indulgent, but by the time Joff starts hacking at Tyrion's gift with his newly-named sword, you can see Tywin beginning to disapprove. Later, during the dwarf jousting farce, he's really seething, and casting daggers at Joff.
Â 
Best of all are the looks Tywin's giving Cersei, who is now getting spill-over from his disgust with Joffrey. He may as well be saying out loud, "OK, you had your chance, and you've proved yourself incapable of controlling your son. OK. I'm taking over starting now and I WILL rein him in, king or not."
Â 
Acting when you have lines to read is a piece of cake compared to acting with just gestures, glances and facial expressions. Charles Dance really shows his chops in this scene.

2113	SerMattHelm	2014-04-15	With Jaime in KL, and having spoken to his father I think it likely he told him just whose bannerman chopped off his hand. Tywin obviously still needs Roose to run the north, but he surely would have demanded Locke's head. Tywin never allows a slight towards his family to go unpunished- why would he allow someone to mutilate his favorite son with impunity?!

Â 
It's possible that Tywin doesn't really care who actually swung the blade - he doesn't want third offsider from the left (ie Locke), he wants Bolton to pay. However, now is not the time to call in that debt - as you say, Bolton is useful where he is, doing what he is doing.
Â 
Tywin's promise of Winterfell to RooseÂ is obviously BS - as we know, Tywin is looking to put Tyrion and Sansa's child in that seat. And a little Lannister assistance in helping Ned Stark's grandchild take down the traitorous Bolton for his part in the RW won't hurt peaceÂ between the North and KL, either.
Â 
Tywin is playing the long game, however Roose Bolton is definitely on borrowed time.
2115	Duckface	2014-04-20	Because show sucks, that's why.
2116	boojam	2014-04-20	With Jaime in KL, and having spoken to his father I think it likely he told him just whose bannerman chopped off his hand. Tywin obviously still needs Roose to run the north, but he surely would have demanded Locke's head. Tywin never allows a slight towards his family to go unpunished- why would he allow someone to mutilate his favorite son with impunity?!It's a puzzle.I can see why The Brave Companions (never liked name in the books, seeing who they are , it's a goofy name)were cut from the show. Could be 'Vargo Hoat' was one of those names D&D did not like. The BC in the books are kind of lose group of sell swords, neither Tywin nor Roose seemed to like them....and it the books the retaking of Harrenhal by the Gregorr and the killing of Hoat is side story that does not fit in a 10 episode show.But your right even show wise Tywin is shown to really favor Jamie. Actually the news of Locke's deed would have probably reached Tywin before Jamie got back.So they restructure Brave Companions into a Bolton what? raiding party , something.I like Noah Taylor and his understated snaky Locke nut case.However jez , considering that Roose is now nearly a Lannister vassal , the plot logic would be to either have Locke arrested or executed.When it came out before the season that Locke was going to the Wall , I thought that was a plot point that Bolton had been given a choice by Tywin to send him there or execute him.(Tho the show's Tywin does not seem one who give Roose that choice, but o well.)It's a plot logic faux pas. (So far!)

2117	King Tommen	2014-04-20	I think Tywin is kind of in Roose's debt in order to have him agree to turn on Robb and help orchestrate the RW. I'm sure he wouldn't be happy about Jaime getting his hand chopped but it may have been forgiven because Tywin needs Roose to get the North back in line for him.Â  As Roose stated, Tywin's not lifting a finger to help him reclaim it from the Ironborn so that could be a form of punishment as well.
Â 
Not sure why Tywin would care about exactly what happened to one random soldier with Roose. What's done is done, don't think he's going to dwell on Locke's fate since it's not going to affect him one way or the other.
2118	A Man Has Said	2014-04-20	For the same reason that Littlefinger lived after Tyrion returned to KL knowing full well that it was he who had framed Tyrion for the attack on Bran?
Â 
Despite the strong vein of brutality running through Game of Thrones, the spirit of forgiveness is strong.
2119	lezboyd	2014-04-20	You know, I had not thought about this! But the OP is right. Tywin of the books AND the series is not a forgiving man when it comes to his family, especially because he values the Lannister name over anything else. To have a lowly lieutenant dare to slice off his son's sword hand is not something he would forgive easily, because what kind of message would it send about the Lannister name? Seeing as Locke cut off Jamie's hand in public, I think Tywin would take some kind of action against Locke and maybe even Roose Bolton.
Â 
However, Tywin has a habit of keeping things close to his chest, so maybe he has put things in motion, and we just don't know it yet. He does want Sansa to bear Tyrion's child, and then take claim to Winterfell, and hence is not helping Bolton take control of the North. Maybe that is when he would go Castamere on the Boltons, and all his lieutenants. Unfortunately, we never find out in the books (that I remember), so I doubt the series will address this too.

2120	TimEaston	2014-04-21	Im a bit confused as I thought Locke was on Rob Stark's side how come when did he switch sides. On another note I am new this forum where is there a general thread to discuss the latest episode? I am about to watch episode 3 in UK now can't wait to see what happens after Jofrey Baratheon's murder.
2121	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-22	Locke was sworn to Roose Bolton. It was Roose Bolton that switched sides.
2122	Mad Monkey	2014-04-27	Theory -- Tywin was the one who ordered Locke to maim Jaime, as part of a plan to drum Jaime out of the Kingsguard.Â
2123	The Killer Snark	2014-04-27	Theory - The writers went 'D'oh!' as soon as they realised they'd made a logical error, but by then it was too late to change.
2124	JagLover	2014-05-02	It is a logical flaw.
Â 
Regardless of how Twin feels about Jaime after their conversation together to him it is all about Lannister pride and power.
Â 
He ravaged the riverlands because someone seized a son he despised. What would be do to someone who had mistreated a lannister captive to the extent of cutting off their hand?. Logically part of the price of the alliance between the Boltons and the lannisters would have been Locke's head and the show has messed up.

2125	JoramunsKazoo	2014-04-14	I find their new "partnership" interesting and perhaps a welcome deviation from the books if it continues.  I would assume that Bronn will continue to ride with Jaime and effectively replace the partnership of Ilyn Payne.  While there were some nice comedy moments between Jaime and Ilyn, I think Bronn will fill that void nicely with his one-liners.  After all, he's a fan (and personal) favorite and he's not going to be of much use at Stokeworth for the TV adaptation.
If so, I am interested to see how their story and dynamic plays out, for better or worse.
2126	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-14	I think it will be better - having a sounding board that can speak will serve Jaime's story much better because we aren't inside his head in the Show.
2127	Boggsy Cyvasse	2014-04-15	Honestly, so happy about this. Bronn is probably my favorite character in both works, with both Jaime and Tyrion being right up there. So Bronn working his way back in to a prominent story-line, as he is about to traipse his way out of another one, great. The fact that it's Jaime that he's going to be trading barbed banter and sword blows with, a HUGE plus, in my book.
Â 
I love the choreography, attitude, and direction of their sparring session. It really did remind me so much of playing one-on-one basketball or sparring in Kung-Fu, playing against (or being) that person who kept up their practice while you sat on your laurels, showing you exactly what your current limitations are, and making you push yourself again. The cocky, shit-eating/shit-talking grin, coupled with that "check-yourself" rough-housing... nostalgia. Would love to see more than a minute of it.
Â 
And of course, Bronn spews out about 3 or 4 classic quotables. I loved Jaime's "come on then."
2128	Ice_and_Fire	2014-04-15	Yes this is one change I am very happy about! I hope it continues and Bronn replaces Payne, Those scenes will be comedy gold!Â
2129	I'll pay the iron price	2014-04-15	Heres to more Bronn screentime
2130	Daske	2014-04-15	Looks like it's going to pan out well.
Â 
It's funny though - I guess Martin was exaggerating after all when he said low-born would never speak rudely to high-born like that! Turns out he can write those kind of scenes after all.
2131	JagLover	2014-04-15	Very good change if that is how it works out. Bronn fades away in the books so it would be great to have him remain on screen.
Â 
Let us hope they find a way of keeping the hound as well!
2132	jeremyfisher	2014-04-15	That'd be great. One of the changes I'd love to see
2133	averde	2014-04-15	It's a good change that I support, especially for a TV show it'd get boring if Jaime talked to a mute for a few seasons. Instead we get fan favorite witty Bronn. Sounds like a good idea to me
2134	Indigocell	2014-04-15	I always thought the reason for using Ilyn Payne was somewhat flawed.Â  He comes from a noble family and would have received an education from a Maester, so he could conceivably read and write couldn't he?
2135	SheRa Seastar	2014-04-16	I always thought the reason for using Ilyn Payne was somewhat flawed.Â  He comes from a noble family and would have received an education from a Maester, so he could conceivably read and write couldn't he?

I think it said somewhere that he couldn't. I'm nowhere near the books so I can't check it though. 
As much as I think Bronn and Jaime will be entertaining to watch,  I always liked that Ilyn Payne was mute, his silence drew things out of Jaime that he would never have said, and allowed him to drop his guard and become vulnerable,  knowing that no one would find out. I don't know if or how they would replicate that relationship with Bronn.
2136	Indigocell	2014-04-16	I suppose we'll have to wait and see.Â  They would have had to recast his role if they went that route in any case.Â  Perhaps it is out of respect to the previous actor that they decided not to.
2137	GHOSTSTARK	2014-04-16	if Bronn does take Ilyn Paynes spot it will be great. those two together will be great.
2138	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-16	They'll be great together. Both character have that cruel sense of wit and the two actors already look like they'll feed off of each other.
Â 
I did really like the Jaime/Ilyn stuff in the books. Ilyn's a character who we're supposed to hate because he carried out the execution on Ned, but we soon see a different side to him and an unexpected friendship between him and Jaime. Despite that, the character is not too well known and it makes sense to use Bronn instead of him, because Bronn would become slightly redundant in S5 despite currently being a main cast member. It's a good deviation because the showrunners are being economical - they don't need to reduce the part of a main actor, but the increased usage will work and make some good TV nevertheless. Good decision from them on this one.
2139	My_Name_Is_Reek	2014-04-16	Wilko Johnson, the actor portraying Ilyn Payne, has pancreatic cancer. I'm sure this is the reason behind the change. He is probably in no shape to swing a sword.
2140	IlAovatar	2014-04-16	Wilko Johnson, the actor portraying Ilyn Payne, has pancreatic cancer. I'm sure this is the reason behind the change. He is probably in no shape to swing a sword.


Indeed.
Â 
Having Bronn take over as Jaime's sparring partner is certainly preferable to finding a new actor to play Payne in my opinion.
2141	Van West	2014-04-16	Looks like it's going to pan out well.
Â 
It's funny though - I guess Martin was exaggerating after all when he said low-born would never speak rudely to high-born like that! Turns out he can write those kind of scenes after all.


Bronn is actually a knight at this point and almost Jaime's equal.

But Bronn would be trusted to keep his mouth shut provided he was getting paid. Bronn's not an idiot; he knows that he'd be in trouble if he started talking about a Lannister behind his back, so he'll be sensible enough to keep his mouth shut. Tyrion would have told Jaime this.

2148	Cyril	2014-04-17	I'm not particularly fond of Bronn, but I do think this is a good decision when it comes down to condensing the amount of actors on the show in a similar manner to how Edric Storm/Gendry were merged.Â  In both cases it also keeps a previously-known from disappearing/becoming very minor with only a few cameos.

Well, Jaime asked if the place they were sparring was discreet?Â  That's why Bronn related his story - to prove that place was, indeed, discreet.Â  I could be wrong but I don't think Bronn would have just blurted it out during the course of their practiceÂ simply to brag
2150	Boggsy Cyvasse	2014-04-17	Bronn is the least discreet person in King's Landing, which is why this is an odd choice for the show to make, particularly considering how counterintuitive the dialogue is.


Â 
Just wondering, what would make you say Bronn is the least discreet person in all of King's Landing? Not necessarily a disagreement, just want to know what goes into that statement. As far as I can recall, Bronn has been fairly discreet up until now. I will concede that he's fairly opinionated and blunt around Tyrion, to whom he is a confidant, of sorts. Outside of his exchanges with Tyrion, we haven't seen much. The only thing I can think of is when he openly admits to Varys that he eradicated the thieves of King's Landing pre-Stannis-Siege. That's Varys though, he could have likely found out. However, if Varys didn't already know what was done with the thieves, I'd say that Bronn must have been fairly discreet about it.
Â 
Sharing that information with Jaime sort of levelled the playing field between them, as best he could. Not that I necessarily think he meant it as an equalizer, but it's kind of like "Hey, I know you've got this secret that you want kept, and I have one of my own that I use this spot in an effort to keep", not that I think Bronn particularly cares about keeping it secret. Laygood's wife (ironic name), however, obviously wants some discretion, and Bronn apparently grants her that much. Bronn sort of offers up a secret of his own to Jaime, in light of Jaime entrusting Bronn with his. I agree that you might think twice about someone's ability to keep a secret after hearing that, but sometimes it makes you feel more comfortable sharing secrets with someone if you know one of theirs.

2151	Le Cygne	2014-04-17	It would get old quickly, since Jaime can't be truthful, Bronn spelled out he's not discreet from the start, and now there's even less reason to be, so apart from humor, there's not much to be gained in the exchanges. I have a feeling he won't be going off with Jaime, perhaps he'll be involved in Cersei's plot next season.
2152	Konradsmith	2014-04-17	I think that if they have more Jaime-Bronn scenes they could be a venue for bringing Tysha back into people's minds. If Jaime were to talk to Bronn about Tyrion (a subject the two men would be bound to discuss), Bronn could say, "You were a good brother to him, mine never bought me a whore for a wife" and then Jaime could look all Coster-Waldau conflicted/rueful.
Â 
Of course in show canon, Bronn's already betrayed Tyrion by lying about Shae getting to the ship, so if Jaime knew that he wouldn't be too keen to hang out with him.

2153	King Tommen	2014-04-17	Bronn says that he's discrete when you pay him to be and I think that's been proven based on how he could have been blabbing with anyone about Tyrion's exploits (there's plenty of secrets that he's keeping in that arrangement) and chooses not to.
Â 
I'm not sure if people understand what discrete actually means.Â  I think book readers got it in their head that since Jaime sparred with Ilyn Payne in the books, that meant you could only have someone who doesn't talk at all. All you need is a guy who can keep secrets when you want him to. If you pay Bronn, he'll keep your secret, it's been demonstrated very clearly on the show.
2154	Le Cygne	2014-04-17	I think that if they have more Jaime-Bronn scenes they could be a venue for bringing Tysha back into people's minds. If Jaime were to talk to Bronn about Tyrion (a subject the two men would be bound to discuss), Bronn could say, "You were a good brother to him, mine never bought me a whore for a wife" and then Jaime could look all Coster-Waldau conflicted/rueful.


Â 
That's making Jaime's plot about Tyrion.Â  They've shown Tyrion to excess, can another character have a scene that's just about them, and not Tyrion?Â  Enough already, the sparring was about Jaime's journey.
2155	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-17	Bronn is the least discreet person in King's Landing, which is why this is an odd choice for the show to make, particularly considering how counterintuitive the dialogue is.
Â 
Jaime: My brother tells me you know how to keep your mouth shut.
Bronn: Yep, I sure can. Say, you know that knight with thunderbolts on his shield? I fuck his wife down here.
Â 
8 seconds Bronn. You kept your mouth shut for 8 seconds, and nobody even paid you to give up that secret. Imagine how quickly he'd unload Jaime's secrets if someone paid him enough.
Â 
Why would Jaime not trust Brienne to be discreet?


Â 
But he doesn't need to keep that secret because it's revelation isn't going to harm him. This knight is probably fairly powerless, and would be incapable of harming Bronn. On the other hand, if Bronn revealed Jaime's secret he'd be in some deep shit with the Lannisters. He's smart enough to know to keep his mouth shut in this instance, because doing otherwise wouldn't benefit him. And he's a man who's ultimately looking for what benefits himself, in the end.
2156	Konradsmith	2014-04-17	Le Cygne, I think his confessing the part he played in the Tysha business is as much about him as Tyrion. His guilt there and then his guilt about what Tyrion does after he frees him are important parts of his journey. Other than Oathkeeper, that confession may be Coster-Waldau's best moment in the season. I think it needs some set-up and another Bronn scene could do that more than adequately.

2157	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-17	What would Bronn be indiscreet about?
Â 
- That he's sparring with Jaime? He wouldn't. He would stop receiving money for it. Lord whatever doesn't pay Bronn, nor the wife.
- That he loves Brienne? Cersei knows and Brienne will soon leave KL
- That Jaime sleeps with Cersei and he's the father of Tommen? Yeah, because those big shiny "L"s all over Joffrey's wedding were discreet and not-telling.
2158	Le Cygne	2014-04-17	Le Cygne, I think his confessing the part he played in the Tysha business is as much about him as Tyrion. His guilt there and then his guilt about what Tyrion does after he frees him are important parts of his journey. Other than Oathkeeper, that confession may be Coster-Waldau's best moment in the season. I think it needs some set-up and another Bronn scene could do that more than adequately.


Â 
I disagree.Â  Tysha has been set up repeatedly, and it's best set up with Tyrion, if they want to go there yet again.Â  It's better as a surprise from Jaime, so I think they should not say anything until that moment.
Â 
But at any rate, Jaime has a plot of his own, he's lost his identity with his sword hand, and his relationship with Cersei, and he needs to work through those things.Â  Enough with the Tyrion propping.
2159	Le Cygne	2014-04-17	What would Bronn be indiscreet about?


Â 
Same thing as the books, he's revealing some pretty major things to Ilyn Payne.Â  He's essentially using him as a confessor, trying to work past these things.Â  Bronn will tell whoever pays him the most.
2160	Konradsmith	2014-04-17	We know he has more scenes with Cersei (one of which will be next episode) and I hope he gets another scene with Tywin to sink the knife in deeper and have the two men yell at one another. I also hope he gets some scenes where he can be sweet with his son and kingÂ and a scene where he can bitch slap Meryn Trant. We know from the Foreshadowing feature that he'll be acting as Tyrion's pseudo-lawyer in the trial in ep. six as well and that the two brothers will have some other scenes together (like whenever he says "Careful, I'm the last friend you've got", filling in for Kevan presumably). That still leaves room for Jaime and Bronn to set up certain things.

Â 
But those things he already knows. The things Jaime confess are related to Cersei and Bronn was Tyrion's right hand, he probably knows already and doesn't care. Bronn is not stupid: he's not going to reveal anything related to that.
2162	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-17	We know he has more scenes with Cersei (one of which will be next episode) and I hope he gets another scene with Tywin to sink the knife in deeper and have the two men yell at one another.

Â 
It wouldn't surprise me if we saw Bronn taking a more direct role alongside Jaime in helping Tyrion escape, in order to ensure that audiences don't dislike him because he refuses to be Tyrion's champion. Of course he'll probably make a jape about wanting to be paid for it, but it wouldn't surprise me if he helps Jaime in some way.
2163	Le Cygne	2014-04-17	Jaime is not stupid, he's not going to say all of that to Bronn.Â  Just not seeing that even they would go there.Â  The Tyrion propping, they'd go there in a heartbeat.
2164	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-17	Â

Â 
And who's going to pay him more than the eldest son within the most powerful family in Westeros?
2165	Le Cygne	2014-04-17	The eldest disowned son.Â  What did Tywin say?Â  A one-handed man with no family.Â  Things have a way of changing...
2166	WTFSalami	2014-04-17	Â 
And who's going to pay him more than the eldest son within the most powerful family in Westeros?


You mean the eldest son that just got disowned by his rich father who really has all the money?
2167	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-17	You mean the eldest son that just got disowned by his rich father who really has all the money?


Â 
Tywin still see's Jaime as his most valuable child, in spite of his comments. Either way, Jaime still holds a lot of power within the Lannister family. The fact is that if Bronn started spilling stuff Jaime didn't want him to, he'd be in deep shit. He's a smart guy who's after his own self-gain, so he knows it makes sense to keep his mouth shut in this instance.
2168	Le Cygne	2014-04-17	Then Tywin is going to die, and Cersei is going to send him off to get rid of him.
Â 
And then one day the one-handed man without a family is going to walk off the job, too.
2169	joachim	2014-04-17	Bronn doesn't know that Jaime's been disowned.
2170	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-17	Then Tywin is going to die, and Cersei is going to send him off to get rid of him.
Â 
And then one day the one-handed man without a family is going to walk off the job, too.


Â 
I imagine by that point, Westeros will be ravaged with winter, Others and dragons. The revelation that Jaime Lannister is no longer a particularly good fighter won't really concern a lot of people when their entire race is at stake.
2171	Le Cygne	2014-04-17	Jaime is not dumb enough to spill his guts to Bronn.Â  That's the point.
2172	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-17	Jaime is not dumb enough to spill his guts to Bronn.Â  That's the point.


Â 
No, although he'll reveal some things because he knows Bronn, in turn, isn't dumb enough to go and reveal Jaime's secrets to other people.
2173	Le Cygne	2014-04-17	He knows no such thing.Â  In fact, I can see Bronn telling Cersei everything.Â  (And it has nothing to do with Bronn being dumb, Bronn is not dumb, either.)Â There was an interesting scene in season 3, Bronn is literally standing between Tyrion and Cersei.

2174	Nifft	2014-04-30	Hi I am new, I am not sure I am even posting correctly since nothing has being showing on the boards but I am trying again anyway:
Â 
What with Bronn guilting Jaime to help Tyrion last episode and also his change to buddy up with Jaime... isn't it looking like they may have our beloved Bronn be in on Jaime's jail break plan and then replace Penny as the travelling partner across the sea?
Â 
Tyrion and Bronn are super awesome together. Â Penny story seems axed. Â Tyrion will still be a kicked puppy but it won't be as depressing if Shae's possible betrayal is sympathetic and Bronn's possible one is just a fake out. Â Pod remains awesome as ever.
Â 
Could Bronn may be enslaved with Tyrion and fill Jorah's shoes for the whole way along that arc(?)
Â 
Thoughts?
Â 
Â 
Edit:Â Â I think Barristan isn't going to give up JorahÂ  Â Changed my mind on seeing some previews, I think someone will out Jorah. Â Still not sure if he is destined to join up with Tyrion on the show though.

2175	phantomg	2014-04-13	In this episode, Ramsay told Roose Bolton about the Stark boys.Â 
I did read all the books but I don't quite remember if both of them are supposed to have this information at this time.Â 
Is it ok? I mean, with all the White Harbor conspiracy thing with Davos, aren't they the only ones to know about Bran and RIckon (besides Sam) because the mute boy told them?
Or I misread something?
Â
2176	Lord Bronn Stokeworth	2014-04-14	I assumed the Boltons' and selected men knew. Why would Ramsay keep it a secret? He needs them dead.
2177	Rhaegar I Targaryen	2014-04-14	Anyone else notice that Roose's map appeared to be made of... skin?Â  
Â 
Look for it the next time you watch it.Â
2178	WiDMNDBAMMD	2014-04-14	Book wise Ramsay is Reek #2 at Winterfell and is the one that kills the millars sons, flays them, burns their bodiesÂ  and brings Bran direwolf silver pendant in his bag. His back up plan the whole time was to "fake kill" them if they couldn't be found. Which Theon and Ramsay do.
Â 
Show wise Dagmer is the one that gives Theon the idea. Ramsay learned later through "tricking" Theon into his reveal about the Starks when he "rescues" him.
Â 
Book wise Roose Bolton does know that Bran and Rickon are really alive. Ramsay sends people looking for them(Bran meets someone heading north to the wall that mentions flawed men were looking for him). Roose points out that Bran/Rickon could resurface and Ramsay says "and I'll kill them again" to which Roose points out that Theon killed them, not him.
Â 
so yeah, Roose and Ramsay know about Bran and Rickon being alive. I wouldn't call it "at this point" because Roose and Ramsay don't meet face to face before Moat Cailin.
Â

2179	Pod The Impaler	2014-04-14	I assumed the Boltons' and selected men knew. Why would Ramsay keep it a secret? He needs them dead.

Because his father would be very displeased that they escaped at all. That's what I get from the books, at any rate.

2182	Chebyshov	2014-04-14	I didn't think Book!Ramsay told his dad because he didn't want to risk his displeasure (it was Roosey's idea to have FAyra, wasn't it?). But I guess the show runners thought it would be inconsistent for him not to mention that to Roose, especially since Show!Ramsay took no part in killing them.
2183	King Zee	2014-04-14	B Roose points out that Bran/Rickon could resurface and Ramsay says "and I'll kill them again" to which Roose points out that Theon killed them, not him.
Â 
so yeah, Roose and Ramsay know about Bran and Rickon being alive.
Â 


Â 
A lot of people seem to be forgetting this scene from the books.
2184	lostinasia	2014-04-14	Anyone else notice that Roose's map appeared to be made of... skin?


To be fair, parchment IS made of skin. That's what they mostly used in the Middle Ages before paper came along. Not too sure when the change occurred.
2185	Khal Shaggydog	2014-04-14	The disturbing thing is the Bolton skin is human, and not animal like most other "civilized" people.
Â 
But yea, the timing and location is way way off from the books, but the ep was written by GRRM so it doesnt seem too much overall is off here. Â They are directly looking to kill Jon, which could incidentally explain a little more about the Pink Letter, but in the books Ramsay was searching for Bran and Rickon as well.Â
2186	WhiteFang	2014-04-14	While the Dreadfort is being discussed...
Â 
Did anyone notice during the shaving scene that Reek has all of his fingers?
There's a close up of his right hand, with all digits present.Â 
Did Ramsay not flay the pinkie of his right hand last season?
Â 
Looks to be a continuity error.
Its disappointing, normally the show is very consistent with details like that.
2187	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-14	I don't think it makes that much of a difference either way, actually it could prove to be a good plot twist. It portrayed that the Starks are still very much a threat for the Boltons (keeping the unsullied rooting for the rightful rulers of the North)and showed Roose to be the treacherous git that he is- wanting the boys hunted down and killed. Also, Ramsay seeing Jon as a threat sets things up well for the pink letter. I'm looking forward to seeing if Locke and Jon interact and how Jon will react, perhaps building up tension for his decision to take on the Boltons later. Locke is probably the type that will rub Robb's death in his face and the Boltons being the new wardens if they do meet....do you think Locke is just sent to CB to find Bran and Rickon or possibly try to kill Jon too? That would be a deviation from the books but it could be interesting.

He is limping thought. Maybe he lost a few toes aswell.
2189	Rhaegar I Targaryen	2014-04-14	Yea I liked the limp
Â 
I think Alfie did an awesome job portraying Reek in that scene, it was very haunting.Â
2190	WhiteFang	2014-04-14	The limp gives me hope that he's missing some toes.
It could have something to do with the bolt that was screwed into his ankle last season though.
Â 
The bit about the fingers irks me- show Reek will still be able to use a bow.
His body isn't mutilated enough.
Â 
Alfie is killing the role though. Reek appears completely broken.
Â 
Â 
Theon discussions are always messed up, can't believe I'm typing this stuff.
2191	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-04-14	I loved the scene with Reek, Ramsay and Roose, but I really just wonder what this will mean for future plotlines. They are literally going into ADWD territory and meanwhile every other storyline is in ASOS. I realize Theon is missing from books 3 and 4 and they didn't want to just exclude him from the show for that long, but still. Are they just going to make up storylines for him in the future, or just really drag his currently storyline out? It's not like he can be a Winterfell for quite awhile in the show right? A lot of questions, but I really love the portrayals of these 3 characters. The guy who plays Roose is fucking awesome.Â
2192	Rikard Stark	2014-04-14	Anyone else notice that Roose's map appeared to be made of... skin?Â

Yep just rewatched it, looks very human ish.... i feel slightly sickend but at the same time: 'damn those Boltons are badass'
2193	Kasporio	2014-04-14	Roose's impersonator is great, but he looks alot... empathetic.
WTF with Ramsay's gf? Will the fake Arya will ever appear?
2194	Konradsmith	2014-04-14	I'm glad they gave this storyline a good chunk of screentime. It really summoned up the appropriate dread that you get reading those chapters of ADWD. They showed the terror that Reek has to live with and also the really fucked up father-bastard dynamic which many of us Bolton fans love so much. I love how Roose walks into that deranged atmosphere and seems completely above it though he's really very much a part of it. Roose arrives and he isn't taken back; he's unimpressed. Just great stuff.
2195	Ramsay Gimp	2014-04-14	Roose knows about Bran/Rickon in the books and the show, people. It's right there in his first conversation with Ramsay in ADWD

Agreed, all the actors did a great job in that scene. It makes sense that Locke and Ramsay would be buds, though I'm not sure it makes sense for Locke to have gotten off scot-free for maiming Jaime given that Roose is pissed about Ramsay maiming Theon
Â 
Also, IÂ reallyÂ hope they still include a Roose-Reek conversation, and Roose telling Ramsay "don't make me rue the day I raped your mother"
2196	aFeastForDragons	2014-04-14	I like the way Locke calls Reek Ramsey's "pet rat" when thats what Jaimie called him but Roose's.Â 
Â 
I watched this scene again and its definitely my favourite of the episode. Roose is so cold and calculating.Â 
Â 
I can't wait to see moat Cailin. Probably to early for Victarion but we will get to see some new Iron Born.
2197	Wontkins	2014-04-14	WTF with Ramsay's gf? Will the fake Arya will ever appear?


I think you answered your own question there. Myranda might be a good replacement for Jeyne Poole.

Â 
Yeah, it's a forgone conclusion that Ramsay will survive for a long time yet. Asha's little anti-Bolton arc is going to feel pretty lame if she doesn't manage to take out at least one Bolton servant of importance, and Ramsay's "girlfriend" seems like a perfect opponent for her IMO. She's just Ramsay with tits.

Â 
Agreed, but the show-runners will very much be following the spirit of GRRM's books if Asha fails in her mission. Take out some Bolton servants, sure, but she isn't taking out Ramsay or rescuing her brother.
Â 
Three ways I can see it going:
Â 
-Asha is captured by the Boltons: with Roose back in charge, she would at least be safe from mutilation as a valuable hostage. Theon's redemptive arc may very well involve saving his sister rather than Jeyne. This would also be a nice little twist - Asha would be "saved" by her little brother rather than saving him like she intended.
Â 
-Asha is captured by Stannis:Â I could see her leading a failed raid on the Dreadfort, realizing Theon isn't there, and narrowly escaping only to fall into Stannis's hands. The show could then pretty much just follow the books from there.
Â 
-Asha returns for the Kingsmoot: Asha fails to rescue Theon, hears her father is dead, and returns home. This is the least likely scenario IMO, since it involves just giving up on Theon and means she will have to return to the North again to be captured by Stannis

3 Great characters and the actors playing them are doing a Sterling job!
Â 
The Opening hunt scene was brutalÂ but well done.Â Ramsay out hunting with his girlfriend andÂ his gimpÂ (Reek) in tow
(I wonder if she'll abuse Reek too?)
2204	Konradsmith	2014-04-14	I looked up "Roose Bolton" on twitter btw and someone had tweeted this little gem: "I bet Roose Bolton eats unsalted potato chips."
Â 
On the subject of Myranda, I think it's fair to assume that she will be killed whilst doing the deed with Ramsay, which would explain him being shirtless and covered in blood. Charlotte Hope who plays Myranda is credited for an Alex Graves episode and a Alik Sakharov one on her CV so it is also fair to place Yara's attack in eps. six or seven. It'll spice up the mid-season and I'm looking forward to it!
2205	Ramsay Gimp	2014-04-14	One thing I've noticed - critics and a good chunk of show-watchers hate Ramsay, and not in the way that's intended. They hate any scene with him in it, because they think it's just pointless sadism.

Makes me feel for Iwan and Alfie, since they play both characters quite well. Hopefully with Joffrey dead, people will be more open to another young, sadistic villain taking up screen time.Â

Â 
Yeah I see it as a problem too. Â I have a suspicion the term 'torture porn' was used and many have latched on to it and it is now building its own momentum. There also seems to be some who see the Starks as 'good and honourable' therefore 'All Northmen must be good and honourable' and they just can't accept that this isn't the case and are reaching for rejections of the the Ramsay story as a result.
2208	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-14	Yea I liked the limp
Â 
I think Alfie did an awesome job portraying Reek in that scene, it was very haunting.Â 


Â 
It was amazing, and creepy. Creepier than Joff's dead. He was all "master! master! I want to play too, master!". He's completely a broken man.
2209	Misnthropia	2014-04-14	He reminded me of Gollum when he is leading Frodo and Sam to Mordor. Eager to help but at the same time is fighting the urge to turn and bite the head off his masters.
Â 
I thought it was done really well. Especially the scene where he is shaving Ramsay. The look on Theons face, stopping. Looking at Roose and waiting for Ramsay to say something else, holding back tears. To say it is Torture Porn or to dismiss it because it is to disturbing is over simplifying the scene and the true meaning of it as well as the pay off that comes.

I hadnt heard about any this. I hope the rage dies down or it cause some script changes.
In a bad way 
Â 
Im thinking this season will have a lot of filler in the "North" strangely im pumped n think its gonna be awesome.
Locke? have no idea whats going on there but whatevr. Its gonna be good I feel it in my bones

Â 
They can easily skip that scene though. It may make more sense to do so in fact. In the book, Brienne looking around for Sansa (and having 8 chapters of it) when every single person reading knew that she was in the Vale and was never going to be found was extremely poor storytelling. I find it easily to be the worst part of AFFC, I would argue the worst part of the entire ASOIAF series.Â  If in the show they have Brienne searching for both Sansa and Arya (and do it in season 4, when we know Arya is still around in Westeros), the storyline is a lot less pointless.
Â 
Personally, I think odds are Myranda is killed by Ramsay sometime this season when he grows bored of her, but I suppose I could see them using her for fake Arya if absolutely necessary. The hesitancy I would have is as a viewer you'd have no sympathy for her like you do for Jeyne Poole in the books.

Â 
This sequence I found to be painful. I just lost any connection to or investment in Brienne's character as that progressed. It just really felt like padding.

I actually blame a lot of this on what D&D did to Joffrey on the show. Inarguably, Joffrey is a total shit in the books, but on the show they took it way further and turned him into an evil sadist. Like, we already got Joffrey forcing Ros to beat that other whore with that spiked statue, and then murdering Ros with his crossbow; so now I think when people see Ramsay hunting the girl in this episode, it's kind of like "been there, done that." WHICH IS NOT THE REACTION THAT PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE.The hesitancy I would have is as a viewer you'd have no sympathy for her like you do for Jeyne Poole in the books.
Yes, that would certainly be the biggest problem. Jeyne needs to be someone sweet and innocent.
2214	Bratchild	2014-04-14	I always thought one reason he'd possibly keep Myranda around,is if she knows anything about healer, possibly even a woods witch.Nothing any where close to being a maester but it is something.
2215	jewelybrook	2014-04-14	I thought the two girls were the same as those who had sex with Theon at the Dreadfort last season. They were Ramsey's partners in crime. I assumed the blonde fell out of Ramsey's good graces.

Â 
Good point. Joffrey is more Ramsay-like in the show, which makes some sense given that he's older than in the books, but emphasizing the psycho-sexual part of it so much kind of takes away from Ramsay's impact.Â 
Â 
One difference they can hopefully show is that Ramsay is not a coward like Joffrey was. He doesn't shy away from battle or rely on others for his dirty work. Also his daddy issues with Roose
2217	Ebethron the Sword	2014-04-15	I thought the two girls were the same as those who had sex with Theon at the Dreadfort last season. They were Ramsey's partners in crime. I assumed the blonde fell out of Ramsey's good graces.


Â 
When I was watching it, I thought that too, but apparently the blonde was a different actress, and had a different character name. Â I liked the scene much better the way we interpreted it.
2218	Luciferase_3H	2014-04-15	Really not a fan of Ramsay having that girl as a partner in crime, I preferred him being his own loose cannon that everyone else felt compelled to follow or else.Â

I don't like Ramsay on the show, not because of the sadism, he is a sadist in the book as well, but because of his general portrayal. He seems way too gleeful and has a kind of boyish attitude that I think is not quite right for the character. I always imagined Ramsay to be a very sinister character, menacing and physically unappealing . Show Ramsay with his sidekicks seems to me like a character that was made to appeal to fangirls, he is like the serial killer stereotype with a female following. This is why doesn't do it for me, despite of all the cruel torture scenes I don't find him as chilling as his book counterpart. This is all subjective though and I do like Alfie Allen's Reek, he does a great job.

2220	Konradsmith	2014-04-15	In GrrM's commentary for "the Bear and the Maiden Fair" he said he was writing a scene with the two girls in it. The actress who played the other girl "Violet" (Stephanie Blacker)Â was pregnant so she couldn't resume her part though. This info was on Charlotte Hope's (Myranda's) twitter page, I believe. That's why they made up a new girl called "Tansy".

2221	Pinkie Baelish	2014-04-15	In this episode, Ramsay told Roose Bolton about the Stark boys.Â 
I did read all the books but I don't quite remember if both of them are supposed to have this information at this time.Â 
Is it ok? I mean, with all the White Harbor conspiracy thing with Davos, aren't they the only ones to know about Bran and RIckon (besides Sam) because the mute boy told them?
Or I misread something?
Â 


Â 
If I can predict anything D and D do(and I can't), I'm guessing Locke's presence in this scene could mean that he's the substitute for Wex Pyke in season 5.Â 
Â 
Â 



I thought the two girls were the same as those who had sex with Theon at the Dreadfort last season. They were Ramsey's partners in crime. I assumed the blonde fell out of Ramsey's good graces.


Â 
I thought the blonde one was the same as last season, but she did say that she was raped, so I doubt it's the same one.

I hope he'll start his quest by going to the Wall to deal with Jon and the kids if they managed to get there by now.
Am I a bad person if I hope he'll run into a band of hungry Tenns on his way north?Â

I assume Locke's got a future this season at the Wall, and maybe even north of it - and I have no problem with that at all. The writers sensibly seem to be trying to maintain at least a few connections between Bran's story and everything else. Locke will probably meet a grisly end sometime this season (Thenns? White Walker?), or perhaps next, but not before he's caused some trouble.

					
					
							Edited by lostinasia, 15 April 2014 - 08:42 AM.
2225	King Tommen	2014-04-15	From another thread but addressing the same issues here:
Â 
1.Locke is not going to hunt Rickon and Osha, he's going to the Wall on Roose's orders to infiltrate the NW in order to get to Jon as the Boltons believe that Jon is either harboring or knows where Bran and Rickon are.Â  Locke also has a built-in excuse to take the black as he can tell Jon that he was the one that cut off Jaime's hand and got sent to the Wall as punishment which will most likely endear him to Jon.
Â 
2. Myranda is not FArya. She's replacing Ramsay's boys.Â  Most likely he'll grow bored with her and turn on her later this season. Stephanie Blacker is the actress who played "Violet" last season (the blonde teasing Theon with Myranda). She was supposed to be in this season but couldn't participate because she was pregnant. I imagine that "Tansy" (you can hear Ramsay call her name on the hunt) is kind of supposed to be her (or an equivalent accomplice) even though she goes by a different name, the resemblance is too similar not for that to be the implication.
Â 
3. Roose still needs to bring his army through the Neck and needs Moat Cailin to surrender in order to do so. He had to smuggle his small group into the North to get to the Dreadfort. He was planning on ransoming Theon back to Balon in order to make this happen. Since Ramsay already tried that and Balon refused, Roose is letting Ramsay and Theon take a crack at liberating Moat Cailin themselves, which will most likely fall very closely to book events.Â  After that, Roose will be able to move his army into the North and eventually Winterfell in S5.
Â 
4. Yara's attack will either come very soon before Ramsay leaves for Moat Cailin (since we can tell both Ramsay and Theon are there when it happens) or possibly it occurs right at the end of the season after all the Moat Cailin stuff and Ramsay/Theon have returned to the Dreadfort.Â  Whatever happens here will go a long way in determining what Yara is going to be doing in S5.
Â 
5. They aren't going to have any significant Northern lords on the show (maybe extras standing around in the background) except for Manderly who is important. He'll be the face of the Northern lords, kind of like how the Greatjon represented them in S1. They don't need to introduce him until S5 though since that's when the Winterfell stuff will occur.Â  I'm certain they won't bother with Arnolf Karstark or any of that stuff as it's not really that important.Â  They have to consolidate their characters and find ways not to have the cast balloon out to 300 people.
2226	Mplsgirl	2014-04-15	Â 
They can easily skip that scene though. It may make more sense to do so in fact. In the book, Brienne looking around for Sansa (and having 8 chapters of it) when every single person reading knew that she was in the Vale and was never going to be found was extremely poor storytelling. I find it easily to be the worst part of AFFC, I would argue the worst part of the entire ASOIAF series.Â  If in the show they have Brienne searching for both Sansa and Arya (and do it in season 4, when we know Arya is still around in Westeros), the storyline is a lot less pointless.

The hesitancy I would have is as a viewer you'd have no sympathy for her like you do for Jeyne Poole in the books.


Brianne's chapters in a AFFC were good in that they provided a the history & character of the areas & people, as well as the effects of the war. Â  And, they provide a link to Bran's experience in the cave with CofF & Bloodraven (Quite Isle & The Wispers). Â Â

Â 
A lot of Arya's material in Book 2-3 covered that as well and were excised.Â 
Â 
It appears from Ep1 that Arya's story will be showing more of the devastation this season. Having two concurrent storylines serving that same purpose in the same season is redundant.

I tend to agree with you. I would't say I don't like Ramsay in the show because I find him incredibly entertaining and still very sadistic. However, I see what you mean about book Ramsay being another level of terrifying. The jokes are entertaining in the show, but they could probably cut back on them a little, so viewers have a better idea of exactly why Theon or Reek is in such a twisted mental state. I'd like to see Ramsay have one of his violent outbursts, to display how terrifying he can be to Reek.Â
2229	Hath4	2014-04-15	Yeah though we have yet to see him not get his way yet. Ramsay in the books is a pretty happy when he is hunting girls with his hounds and hurting reek he loves that stuff. When things don't go his way is when he losses it.
2230	RhaenysBalerion	2014-04-15	That scene was gold. It was Â Jaime/Tywin/deer skinning all over again. Badass dad scolds son who displeased him. Both actors did an absolutely stunning job and Alfie Allen's performance was priceless too.Â 
Â 
My "problem" with the scene was that I laughed. I'm not sure I'm supposed to laugh. I didn't laugh reading this in the books. But show-Ramsay cracks me up. The actor is so genius that I keep laughing and laughing and somehow, no matter how gruesome the Theon torture and the whore-hunting both were, my attention is entirely on what a freaking amazing acting this guy does. Of course the script is responsible too because the show focuses on portraying Ramsay as comic relief while the book focused on his sadistic and brutal side. With the graphic torture scenes previous season that was sort of kept in balance, you could see Ramsay's mad outbursts, in this episode though, I just kept laughing. When he greeted Walda and kissed her cheek, when he and Lock (the two maniacs) greeted each other like best buddies, when told Theon about Robb... In a way, he is like Vargo Hoat was in the books. A sicko sadist bastard you couldn't help but love because he was so funny. Not sure if it's being done intentionally since Lock wasn't funny in any way (except now when he said "Who the fuck's Jon Snow?") and they are making up for that through Ramsay...Â 
Â 
My problem (without quotation marks) with the scene was Theon not cutting Ramsay's throat when he was given the blade AND told about Robb's death. I know, the mental state, the fear, the damaged mind, but it still seems to me like a big gaping plot hole. Maybe because in the show we didn't get five paragraphs of My name's Reek it rhymes with freak and further stuff to stress how very damaged Theon is. But really, even in the books there was still rebellion in him with the Jeyne business.Â
2231	Onna Lewyys	2014-04-15	I don't see how it can be a plot hole when it is the actual point of the scene. He didn't cut Ramsay's throat when he had the perfect opportunity and reason to. That in itself proves how broken he is.
2232	HouseHarrison	2014-04-15	In the books Ramsay knew the entire time, as he was the one who arranged the deception.
Â 
And what Ramsay knows Roose knows, even if Ramsay doesn't wish it.

I get what your saying about him with Jeyne, but wasn't that at a later point in the book? I know he was still very messed up even at the end of ADWD, but I guess I thought he had improved his mental health from the beginning of the book. I felt like right when we were introduced to "Reek" in the books (like we just were in the show) he never would have dared rebel against Ramsay. The thought of what Ramsay would do to him if he rebelled seemed to overtake any other emotions he had at the time.Â
2234	Onna Lewyys	2014-04-15	Yes, he improves when Jeyne comes into his life because she gives him something to fight for.

Â 
I know. And you are right.Â 
Only, Ramsay would be DEAD if he rebelled and cut his throat with the razor, so he wouldn't do anything to him. And Roose wouldn't go on with the Reek stuff. Obviously, how could Theon know that. Dunno why this bugs me, it's kinda straightforward, if you look at it from a logical point of view.Â

I think we saw in this episode that if the Boltons did capture Yara, she would be Roose's prisoner and would not be subjected to Ramsay, at least not at first. Â But if her uncle refused to ransom her and Roose came to believe that she lacked strategic value...
2242	ViennaGirl	2014-04-15	I don't like Ramsey partnering with Myranda, although I thought the hunting scene was very brutal and incredibly well done. I think of him as the leader of that horrible little gang of men. Adding a woman adds a sexual element that I don't think Ramsey would experience - I know he loves to rape and torment women (and men), but trusting a woman or working with one doesn't seem like it would be part of his MO. But to the extent that I'm able to watch the Ramsey scenes, I think he's doing a great job.
2243	Onna Lewyys	2014-04-15	Yes, there's definitely a degree of horrific misogyny in Ramsay's character that's diminished by Myranda's presence. It's awful, but I kind of hope he kills her soon.
2244	Hath4	2014-04-15	Yes, there's definitely a degree of horrific misogyny in Ramsay's character that's diminished by Myranda's presence. It's awful, but I kind of hope he kills her soon.


I don't really agree he still his doing the hunting girls for sport thing. the dialogue such as we half to reward the hounds and down girls down obviously applies that he does this a lot. as he does in the books. Myranda really is not aÂ normal girl she is a sadist. we don't know how ramsay would react in the books if he came upon a girl that also enjoyedÂ sadism. Â
2245	Onna Lewyys	2014-04-15	Well, of course the misogyny is still there. I just don't think it's as blatant as it could be (and is in the books). But that's a relatively small nit. I still think Ramsay is a complete monster.

2246	Cold Hands warm heart	2014-04-15	Since this show seems to be epic in foreshadowing , bringing the Thenns in the way they did, I wonder who they shall eat. If karma serves a purpose, let it be Ramsey.
2247	Raksha 2014	2014-04-15	Yes, there's definitely a degree of horrific misogyny in Ramsay's character that's diminished by Myranda's presence. It's awful, but I kind of hope he kills her soon.


Â 
I'm sure Ramsay will soon oblige you...
2248	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-04-15	Â 
I know. And you are right.Â 
Only, Ramsay would be DEAD if he rebelled and cut his throat with the razor, so he wouldn't do anything to him. And Roose wouldn't go on with the Reek stuff. Obviously, how could Theon know that. Dunno why this bugs me, it's kinda straightforward, if you look at it from a logical point of view.Â 


This is true. I guess it's difficult to say given that he's not provided the same opportunity in the books obviously. In the end I didn't have a problem with the scene just because I really want the unsullied to understand how mentally crippled he is at this point and I thought the scene got the point across pretty well.

You can't assign logic to emotional disorders. Theon is paralyzed by fear. What if he doesn't cut deep enough? What if the blade isn't sharp enough? What if he drops it? Those are the kinds of things that go through his head in the book. I know that doesn't exactly translate to the screen without voiceover or something, but surely it's not hard to imagine?
2250	Lady Baela Targaryen	2014-04-16	The latest interview with Michael McElhatton (http://zap2it.com/bl...le_task-2014-04):
Â 
"Now that we've all had a couple of days to get our obsessing of Joffrey's death out of our systems, it's time to start examining some of the other major developments in Sunday'sÂ "Game of Thrones"Â episode. While "The Lion and the Rose" ended with the death of one of the show's major villains, it also showed Ramsay Snow being at his most disturbed.

Â 
Following Ramsay's hunt of one of his former followers, he proves his worth to his father, Roose Bolton. Though Ramsay's maiming of Theon is something Roose initially considers to be a mistake, Ramsay proves that turning Theon into Reek is actually a good move for his family.Â 
Â 
This is the second time people close to Roose have done what he considers a bad call with their prisoners, which explains why he is so irritated with his bastard son initially. Michael McElhatton, who plays Bolton, discusses withÂ Zap2itÂ Roose's mentality when he reunites with his bastard son.
Â 
"[Roose] trades two people: He trades Jaime and he trades Theon, who were both sons of very, very wealthy, powerful men. Both are maimed, interestingly enough, and he chastises both Locke and Ramsay for maiming both parties. He's furious with Locke for cutting off the hand -- 'You've damaged the merchandise' -- and the same with Ramsay and Theon," McElhatton says.

He continues of Roose's test for Ramsay, "I think we find out in that scene in episode 2 that, initially, he thinks the guy is just a psycho, and then he realizes, by the end, the thing that's revealed [with Theon as Reek]. So he offers [Ramsay] what he thinks is an almost impossible task to take Moat Cailin."
Â 
Season 4 episode 2 is the first time McElhatton acted opposite Alfie Allen as Reek, and he admits it's a transformation that's a bit disturbing to witness in person.Â "I think Alfie does a brilliant job portraying him," McElhatton says. "You wonder, how is he going to come back? Is he going to come back from that, or can you come back from that, having endured all the mental and physical torture and debauchery that he's gone through?"Â Â 
McElhatton already exploredÂ Roose's interesting relationshipÂ with Ramsay with Zap2it, and admits feels like the new Warden of the North has some love for the Bastard of Bolton. But he also thinks Ramsay could be Roose's downfall.
Â 
"Ramsay could be his Achilles heel. We'll see," McElhatton says. "George [R.R. Martin] hasn't written it yet, but 'love at your peril' would be a good motto for 'Game of Thrones.' Anybody who has any affection or care for anything."Â Â 
He calls the relationship between Roose and Ramsay "very Shakespearean," and promises a payoff for their story arc before the end of Season 4. And while Joffrey might be dead, expect Roose and Ramsay to stick around for a while longer.Â 
Â 



"Season 5 they say [Roose] comes into it a lot more, and we get into some dastardly stuff," McElhatton teases."
2251	RhaenysBalerion	2014-04-16	This is true. I guess it's difficult to say given that he's not provided the same opportunity in the books obviously. In the end I didn't have a problem with the scene just because I really want the unsullied to understand how mentally crippled he is at this point and I thought the scene got the point across pretty well.


Â 
Alfie Allen's acting is good enough to make you believe, I think. It's just that my attention was rather drawn away from thatÂ by Ramsay being entertaining and he's a damn good actor too.Â 
Â 


You can't assign logic to emotional disorders. Theon is paralyzed by fear. What if he doesn't cut deep enough? What if the blade isn't sharp enough? What if he drops it? Those are the kinds of things that go through his head in the book. I know that doesn't exactly translate to the screen without voiceover or something, but surely it's not hard to imagine?


Â 
Yeah, I know. Not his feelings are logical, for the viewer to imagine what you described is logical: horrible mental and emotional state -> he's afraid -> he doesn't act. I was irrational enough to find it a bit strange though, which is probably due to having read the books and knowing how Roose treats Theon, how Theon develops later, etc.Â
2252	Frumpus	2014-04-16	Yes, there's definitely a degree of horrific misogyny in Ramsay's character that's diminished by Myranda's presence. It's awful, but I kind of hope he kills her soon.


I think she will die but I don't think they are setting Ramsay up to kill her.
Â 
I get the impression that Ramsay is very asexual and not interested in sex, only torture and murder. That could explain why he has a female companion who isn't just a bedslave.

Juicy news about season 5 but it looks like Roose won't be featuring a lot this season again. Any idea in which episode he will come back? We will now follow Theon and Ramsay to Moat Caillin and Roose will stay in the Dreadfort.

2255	Ghost from Winterfell	2014-04-16	One thing I've noticed - critics and a good chunk of show-watchers hate Ramsay, and not in the way that's intended. They hate any scene with him in it, because they think it's just pointless sadism. The review at Atlantic really pissed me off because they basically dismissed the scene as stupid/unwatchable, despite the great acting and important plot and characters developments it featured. I'm glad Ran here at Westeros.org praised the scene
Â 
Makes me feel for Iwan and Alfie, since they play both characters quite well. Hopefully with Joffrey dead, people will be more open to another young, sadistic villain taking up screen time.Â 


Â 
That's sad. It seems they don't realize the Bolton are now important parts of the story.
2256	Hath4	2014-04-16	Most likely roose will leave the dreadfort to return to his army's in the riverlands. Most of the Bolton forces are trapped there. Yara attack on the dreadfort is in epiosde 6 and you can see ramsay fighting them so he will still be there. before he can march on moat cailin he has to raise an army. moat cailin will most likley be in episode 8 sense Ralph kenning was cast for an Alex graves episode and it will not be episode 3. So episode 8 will be reek negotiating the surrender and ramsay betraying the ironborn and flaying them. Then in episode 10 ramsay meets back up with roose ( the shot from the trailer with ramsay and roose meeting with their armies to there backs.)

2257	Pinkie Baelish	2014-04-16	Michael McElhatton deserves an award just for that look of utter disdain when he says "I place far too much trust in you." If this scene was an indication of the quality of Theon/Bolton scenes this season, I'm very much looking forward to it.Â 
Â 
Hopefully they have the conflict between Roose and Ramsay building so that Roose has a chance to deliver the "rue the day I raped your mother" line.
2258	Konradsmith	2014-04-16	Hopefully we get at least one more Roose appearance in the interim between now and ep. 10, Hath4. If not I'll miss the rascal.
2259	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-16	Hopefully we get at least one more Roose appearance in the interim between now and ep. 10, Hath4. If not I'll miss the rascal.


Â 
He has a lot of leeching to catch up on to remove the taint of being south of the Neck for so long. He also has a new young bride so, and Walder Frey would put it, 'he has that to look forward to'.
2260	Ghost from Winterfell	2014-04-22	The problem is: I can't see any development in Bolton's story without Jeyne Poole or at least a frightened northern young girl who can pose as Arya but we have no indication she will be cast.
2261	Onna Lewyys	2014-04-22	I agree, I don't see how the story could possibly work without Jeyne Poole. But I wouldn't worry until next season. If we don't hear of her being cast for S5, then we'll have a problem.
2262	Arry Lannister	2014-04-23	(keeping the unsullied rooting for the rightful rulers of the North)
Â 

No! The Boltons are the rightful kings now, all Roose wants is for the north to become a quiet place with quite people unlike Robb who would compromise his oaths just so he could get some ass. (no matter how nice that ass is).

Yeah, I agree. Just mentioning her this season would be nice.
2265	Naturally Low Highborn	2014-04-28	EDIT:Â  This post is in response to a page 2 comment that didn't "quote".
Â 
I disagree, respectfully. Brienne's quest develops her as a strong, becoming stronger,Â character.Â  IMHO, she will be the one to put some of the puzzle pieces together.Â  While on her quest, she ties some questions up, like what happened to the Hound (or maybe creates the theories), kills some folks, learnsÂ  or suspects things others might not otherwise (such as Gendry's parentage), and meets LS.Â  Without the 8 quest development chapters, we loose a lot of knowledge as readers/watchers.

2266	jaimereborn	2014-04-15	I found Brienne's reaction to Cersei's 'do you love him' to be heavily unnecessary. It takes a lot of the mystery out of Brienne and Jaime's unspoken connection, and creates a previously non-existent romance to root for that was never overly suggested in the books at all. What I so liked about Jaime & Brienne's relationship was just how unconventional it was and how little it revolved around ideas like love and sex. It seemed to be based more around shared experience, admiration and trust. I was disappointed that they felt the need to throw a 'Hollywood' kind of romance into this dynamic. Also, Brienne's reaction was completely unbelievable, she easily could have denied it.
2267	SheRa Seastar	2014-04-16	I think there is a love between Jaime and Brienne in the books though. Brienne didn't say yes or no, and I think any sort of connection between them has marked brienne as an enemy of Cersei's now because cersei is the only one (in her mind) allowed to have any sort of relationship with Jaime. I expect cersei to be vile to brienne in the coming episodes, instead of just plain mocking.
2268	MyLittleFinger	2014-04-16	That scene was the one part of the episode that completely sucked (maybe the Loras-Oberyn "YO I LIKE DUDES TOO REMEMBER?"). Just didn't work. Seems like an unnecessary addition because you might as well use all the actors since they're all there.
2269	TheonsPhantomCock	2014-04-16	I'm beginning to find Brienne really irritating. Gwendoline Christie just seems really wooden this season in particular. Cringeworthy. And yes, I didn't like it at all. Unnecessary to spell it out like that,
2270	Le Cygne	2014-04-16	What I find fascinating is that even after the author called out the romantic connection that was clearly there in the books some are insisting it wasn't there.
2271	Fylimar	2014-04-16	I don't know - I found Briennes reaction quite normal. The Queen asks her about her personal feelings, I'm sure - being shy myself - I would not have answered either, because I would be shocked. And even if Brienne loves Jaime - that doesn't necessarily mean relationship-love, it could mean brotherly love
2272	The Black Wolf	2014-04-16	I'm really torn on this... On the one hand, I don't like how direct, open and "in your face" Brienne's feelings for Jaime became. It was, I don't know, too soon? The wrong moment? On the other hand, this is totally what Cersei would have done if she met Brienne at the wedding, and I think Brienne would have been very embarrassed and silent.
2273	Ghosteline	2014-04-16	Yeah, I didn't like it either as it didn't fit Brienne and her and Jamies storyline. from the books I also had a complitely different kind on connection in mind which may or may not be romantic.Â 
Brienne always seemed tough lady with a sharp wit and tongue that it would be hard to get her off-guard but TV Briennes reaction to Cersey was just too vulnerable.Â
2274	boojam	2014-04-16	It's a strange bit of dialog since it was not in the novel.Yet George wrote this episode, unless Dave and Dan did a modification, which has happened before.There is an interview with Gwendoline Christie about that scene, can't seem to find it again, she asked about the dialog, but gives such an oblique answer I could not make out what she was saying.
2275	Will&Chrismom	2014-04-16	What I find fascinating is that even after the author called out the romantic connection that was clearly there in the books some are insisting it wasn't there.


This, a thousand times. Do people not recognize rather obvious romantic subtext when it is written down plainly on the page? I'm not asking to be snarky, I'm asking in all seriousness. I read all the books twice through and the Brienne chapters are full of pretty blatant romantic subtext; the Jaime chapters a bit less so, but not much. Whether their mutual attraction (heretofore unacknowledged by either in the books) leads anywhere is open for debate, but the feelings? Nope.Â 
Â 
I had no problems with the Cersei/Brienne scene at all. In fact, on a second viewing I find it rather brilliant. Cersei just basically dumped Jaime in the prior episode for the stupidest reason possible: he "took too long" to get back to her (like that was his fault), and oh yeah, he's minus a hand and Cersei doesn't like that. And yet in the very next episode she's calling out another woman for having feelings for Jaime. If Cersei can't have Jaime--even if she doesn't much want him anymore--then nobody can. It's another fine example of Cersei's awesome bitchiness that was on display pretty much through the whole episode. She's just never happy unless she's undercutting somebody else, especially another woman.Â 
Â 
Brienne, meanwhile, has a perfect reaction to Cersei's in-your-face comment: stunned silence followed by a lack of denial. And this is a wonderful example of Brienne's innocence, that has been rather in hiding up to now. All the criticism of Brienne's early introduction on the show--she was too hard, too "mean", not sweet enough--well, there it was. When she talked about how Jaime rescued her, her face just melted into this glorious smile. Gwen Christie's dimples helped to add to the youthful, girl-in-love effect, but her whole face just changed significantly, and we saw the innocent, vulnerable girl beneath the hard, toughened Woman Knight exterior. It was so fitting, too, that it would be Cersei--the one woman with any claim on Jaime--who would cut Brienne down. Cersei is the opposite of Brienne in every way and probably nobody else could make Brienne feel as insecure.
Â 
I loved the whole scene, and hey, the author wrote that episode, so clearly the author himself has decided that at a bare minimum, Brienne is in love with Jaime, even if an actual romance between them never materializes.
2276	Le Cygne	2014-04-16	This, a thousand times. Do people not recognize rather obvious romantic subtext when it is written down plainly on the page?


Â 
I know, it's like let's pretend this isn't happening, because we don't want it to happen.Â  I want her/him to be with X or Y instead (usually someone they never met, or completely ruled out)...
Â 
I put this together a couple of years ago because I thought, well, maybe a little text will make the point, and we can move forward and talk about the rest of the story.Â  Nope...

2277	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-16	Thought it was obvious that there was something between them.
2278	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-04-16	I actually really liked it and loved GC's face and think she had a perfect reaction. Â She's talking to the King's mother, which is automatically awkward and uncomfortable and then here she is asking these rude questions and making these rude comments to Brienne. Â Uncomfortable/awkward and would render me speechless, too. Â  I think you can interpret Brienne's not saying anything in several different ways. I too also like that we got to see a softer, sweeter side of Brienne in that moment. Â It's that side of her counter-balanced with how she is perceived that makes her an interesting and fully human character in the books.Â

2279	Batman	2014-04-16	No subtlety, just a sledgehammer of a scene.Â
2280	Angmar	2014-04-16	What is it with people in the ASOIAF fandom hating anything involving romance? Just like that Brienne/Jaime shippers thread, "i want to burn any shipper I find"
Â 
You people are beyond boring. 
Â 
Anyways, I liked that scene. I found it fitting- Cersei would be aggresive, and Brienne would be shy. She's not really one for verbal insults or attacks like the sort.
2281	Mr Fixit	2014-04-16	A great scene. Brienne was very sweet and not at all sure of her own feelings, and it's these very insecurities that Cersei thrives on. I don't see what's "unsubtle" or "wrong" with this.
2282	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-04-16	I find much more disturbing that Sansa Stark is there and Brianne doesnt give a damn.
2283	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-16	We still haven't accepted that many things in the show have to be OBVIOUS because we can't read the character's mind like in books, isn't? Just because Cersei has figured it out doesn't mean Jaime and Brienne have. Jeez. Besides, Jaime has just lost his son and his brother is accused of murder: I doubt him and Brienne will discuss their relationship or their mutual feelings.
2284	Ser Maneth Grossart	2014-04-16	Was I the only one who read that Brienne's "big eyes" reaction was also due to the realization that Cersei had just "gone there"? I mean she had heard all the rumors but to presence Cersei acknowledging the whole thing just took her by surprise. If this was the intention, and I think it was because her eyes just widened even more in the end, then it was a powerful scene. No the "do you love him?", but rather Brienne seeing with her own eyes the truth about Jamie and Cersei.

Â 
Interesting. And yes, probably, because in a previous scene, Loras let Jaime know he already knows. Also, when Jaime sends Brienne away she figures it out and even asks him if he's true. He doesn't deny it.
2286	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-04-16	When you don't have internal dialogue you need to spell this shit out. Just because you read the books and know Brienne and Jaime's complicated feelings, it doesn't mean the show shouldn't introduce the concept. And I'm sure the majority of the people complaining about this shit are the same people who claim the show makes Cersei a piece of furniture, yet when there's a scene of her using a bit of cunning and really reading someone's reactions/putting their back against a wall it's awful.
Â 
Also if you don't pick up on any romantic subtext toward each other in the books then honestly you just need to reread the chapters. Cersei also asked Brienne if she loved Jaime, not if she wanted to fuck him, so I'm not sure why people are on this high horse about how the show has reduced their relationship to lust or sex.Â 
Â 
Gwendoline's reaction also appears to be "Uhh...WHAT? Wait, do I love him? Uhhh, this is the queen...FUCK." It appeared to me that Cersei opened her eyes a bit but she wasn't even sure, but didn't want to say no because she can't lie to save her life.

2287	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-16	With Shae/Tyrion and Jon/Ygritte going down the drain soon they've got to establish another romance (even if nothing becomes of it).

Many watchers want some form of romance or shipping in a show and GOT has a rather brutal record in that department...I think D&D are just trying to spice things up a bit.
2288	Le Cygne	2014-04-16	Sure, it's a dark story, but there's love in multiple plots.  Love is a powerful motivator.

They don't need to, because it's already in the books...
2290	Chebyshov	2014-04-16	I'm beginning to find Brienne really irritating. Gwendoline Christie just seems really wooden this season in particular. Cringeworthy. And yes, I didn't like it at all. Unnecessary to spell it out like that,


Â 
That's Brienne though...a great toe-headed plank. It was cringeworthy. I physically cringed as it was happening. But listening to Christie explaining how it's something Brienne's never really thought about and doesn't want to think about makes it more palatable.
Â 
I'm not sure why GRRM felt like we needed it, but maybe because we lack Brienne and Jaime's internal monologues. Still, it was pretty obvious they were growing on each other.
2291	Beric175	2014-04-16	The Brienne/Jaime stuff is there in the books and Brienne is awkward enough and shy enough in face of a figure of authority like Cersei to not say anything and she does not expect this accusation at all from the former queen regentÂ of all peopleÂ and so I wouldn't know what to say if someone just outright hurled that stuff at me. the best thing was to walk away from it in my opinion. Don't confirm anything, don't deny it, just ignore it.Â Â
2292	SeventySeven	2014-04-16	You know, I'm actually rather surprised this thread has only popped up now. Let me guess; OP is a Jaime/Cersei shipper who didn't properly read Brienne's affc chapters?Â 
Â 
Â 


Yeah, I didn't like it either as it didn't fit Brienne and her and Jamies storyline. from the books I also had a complitely different kind on connection in mind which may or may not be romantic.Â 
Brienne always seemed tough lady with a sharp wit and tongue that it would be hard to get her off-guard but TV Briennes reaction to Cersey was just too vulnerable.Â 


Â 
Brienne has a sharp wit and tongue? She doesn't, not in the books or the show. She's awkward, stilted and very vulnerable and she's this way as a result of the mockery and abuse she has suffered all the way through her life. Her own septa used to tell her she was slow, her possible suitors laughed in her face, she grew up thinking she wasn't worth much at all. The only times she's somewhat comfortable is around Jaime (especially in the show, less so in the books) and when she's fighting/being a knight. When it comes to words and interactions she's lost and very very vulnerable, so her reaction to Cersei's words was just perfect.
Â 


Â 
I know, it's like let's pretend this isn't happening, because we don't want it to happen.Â  I want her/him to be with X or Y instead (usually someone they never met, or completely ruled out)...
Â 
I put this together a couple of years ago because I thought, well, maybe a little text will make the point, and we can move forward and talk about the rest of the story.Â  Nope...

Except is all over Brienne's chapters in affc, and grrm wrote them? This is like Loras/Renly all over againÂ

Â

This. That's how Brienne is, it's meant to be awkward.
Â 
As for why grrm felt we needed it, it's in the books so the question should be why wouldn't we need it?
2293	Mr Fixit	2014-04-16	I find much more disturbing that Sansa Stark is there and Brianne doesnt give a damn.


Â 
Now this is a fair point. It would've been nice to see Brienne approach Sansa for a moment or two. Since GRRM wrote this episode, I honestly don't know why that didn't happen.

2294	Natasi	2014-04-16	I loved the scene. 
I think disbelievers just glazed over their interactions in the books and choose not to subscribe to the obvious for whatever reason. The most hilarious arguments made against their mutual attraction / admiration are: She's not hot enough for Jaime because Jaime only likes hot chicks. And Brienne only loves Renly (because you are not allowed to crush on more than one person in your lifetime, especially a person who you've interacted with on a deeper, more personal level than the distant idolatry of your first crush). 
I love that Martin wrote this in and Jaime's glances at the two of them talking were priceless. He looked very uneasy, like he wanted to go over and save Brienne or distract Cersei. At this point he still wants Cersei, that really won't change until we get the burning of her letter once she is imprisoned by the Faith, but you can definitely see that Brienne will continue to be a pleasant addition in his life. The only person right now save Tyrion who respects him.

Because they didn't want to upset the narrative too much. They wanted to bring Jaime and Brienne back early so they could interact with other characters, but keep the story as it's in the books. To have Brienne interact with Sansa would have upset it, so they avoided it.
Â 
It's poor planning if you ask me, and it makes no sense that Brienne didn't try to speak to Sansa if only to let her know how much Cat had tried and fought to get her daughters back,

Â 
I agree. It could very well have been a very poignant scene.
2297	Belisarius09	2014-04-16	It bothered me a bit, because I feel like at this point in the story Brienne's feelings for Jaime are just starting to develop. Â She should still have lingering feelings for Renly at this point. Â It really isn't cemented for me that Brienne loves Jaime until she has that dream where Renly transforms into Jaime after she's unconscious following her encounter with Biter. Â 
Â 
IE: a few things need to happen first. Â 1. Jaime needs to honor his promise to Lady Stark by sending Brienne on her quest. Â 2. Jaime needs to give Brienne the valerian sword. Â 
Â 
In my book its too soon to jump to "Brienne loves Jaime." Â Those feelings need to take more time to develop. Â

I can see George going, why did you send them to King's Landing? Oh well, gotta work with it. And intentionally avoids Brienne talking to Sansa because it wouldn't work with the plot down the road. 
The other possibility is that there was such a scene, but it was cut. Sansa is very delicate right now. Married to the family who killed hers, the laughing stock of said family at that. Even if Brienne offered her sympathies I think Sansa would only give her a modest thanks at this point. She might even be edgy enough to toss an accusation that Brienne should have stayed and protected Cat from what happened instead of trying to save Sansa (which to Sansa, seems impossible at this point).
2299	HairGrowsBack	2014-04-16	No way the Lannisters would let her near Sansa , they must have some clue as to why she's here in the first place . I do agree though that they should've adress this properly.

And how would you write her feelings developing, since she's to leave KL soon? This is a case where the show had to just go for it and make it obvious as there are no other ways to develop it. Brienne is not going to start to talk her feelings for Jaime while on the road with Pod, right? We're not in her head, like in the books.

I think I would have written a line for Brienne where she says something to Cersei like "I admire Jaime as a knight". Â Something simple like that. Â Full blown "Oh shit, I love him and I'm being confronted about it," seems too rushed.
Â 
And then when she's leaving KL she can say something to Jaime like, "You've really proven me wrong, you do have honor." Â And then when she's traveling the rode looking for a her sister a maid of three and ten, she can confess to her fellow travelers that she met a true knight, and she admires him. Â And then the dream sequence and then her defending Jaime to Lady Stoneheart and the BWB. Â Tada... developed over time.

But she doesn't admire Jaime as a knight. Not really.

2303	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-04-16	To be honest if Brienne, who is known to have served Renly and Catelyn, both traitors, goes up and starts speaking to Sansa at the royal table about how she swore a vow to return her to her mother there would be no quicker way to a black cell. To have her go up and speak with her at the wedding is pretty stupid. However, she should've at least been seen worrying or fussing over Sansa, perhaps exchanging a look or something to remind us why Brienne is even there in the first place. I suppose they did address that briefly in the scene with Jaime but Brienne's #! priority should be Sansa and currently it just seems like she's on vacation or something.

Â 
It would be ooc for Brienne to speak about her feelings though, with anyone. It's much more in character for her to have it pointed out (and Cersei wasn't really pointing it out imo, she was lashing out at Brienne because she's a lady who's free not to act like one and that annoys her, and she just happened to be right about Brienne's feelings for Jaime) by someone else, and be completely speechless and mortified at the thought that it might be true and has indeed developed much deeper feelings for this annoying dude she was paired with.

At the table yes. What they should have done is swap the Margaery/Brienne scene in episode 1, for a scene with Sansa. They didn't have to do much with it, just have Brienne telling Sansa her mother had fought and fought, and she's so sorry. It would have also resolve the problem that we saw no reaction from Brienne about Cat's death, which is silly because Brienne and Cat will meet again...

I highly, highly doubt we are going to get any dream sequences for Brienne. I'm happy to be wrong, but Jaime's rather major dream about Brienne before he went back to Harrenhal was cut from the show, we've seen no dreams from any of the other characters and even Dany's visit to the House of the Undying is not so much a dream as a hallucination/prophecy of sorts. I don't see the writers giving any other characters but Bran any dream sequences, as a means of streamlining the narrative for viewers who don't read the books. If lots of characters have prescient dreams then, from a TV viewer perspective, it sort of takes the steam out of Bran being a Warg and something of a seer.
Â 
I don't think anything was off base in doing a big, unsubtle reveal of Brienne's feelings this early on. As for interacting with Sansa, I'm not sure how that could have fit in. Perhaps the Cersei/Brienne scene could have been restaged with Brienne making to approach Sansa and being interrupted by Cersei, and then being so taken aback by Cersei's accusation that she, Brienne, sort of stumbles off without speaking to Sansa as intended. That's really the only scenario I think that could have logically worked, and in any case, Brienne might well have taken to heart Jaime's comments from last week's ep about Sansa being safe in King's Landing, at least for now. Brienne is stubborn and pushy but not stupid.
Â 
Vis a vis Brienne and Margaery--this to me was a very obvious expository scene meant to cut out the later confrontation she has with Loras and having to spend time in a black cell before Loras is convinced Brienne didn't kill Renly. This, plus Brienne approaching Margaery and Joffrey so that Margaery could declare out loud that Brienne didn't kill Renly, removes the necessity of Brienne proving her innocence on that score. Something that will be missed, but that doesn't contribute to a streamlined narrative on the show; at this point, the main issue has to be getting Brienne going on her mission to find Sansa.

2306	Sam with Hooters	2014-04-16	I'm not sure the Cersei/Brienne confrontation is really much in character for Cersei.Â  IMHO she'd be more likely to make fun of her behind her back, something like this:
Cersei and Jaime are alone together (she's rebuffed him again).
Cersei:Â  That hulking she-beast from Tarth is in love with you.
Jaime:Â Â  Brienne?Â  No.
Cersei:Â  I've seen the way she looks at you when she thinks you're not looking.Â  Can you imagine?Â  That ungainly, oafish, mannish wench on your arm at all the dances at King's Landing!Â  She probably *actually think's you'll marry her*!Â  *smirk*

Â 
Cersei mocks people to their face constantly on the show. Even Robert, albeit only once. It's one of the major aspects of the character, that she's openly bitchy toward anyone and everyone.
2308	Sam with Hooters	2014-04-16	...and undoubtedly much, MUCH WORSE behind their backs!
2309	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-04-16	I don't know, I think show Cersei gets off on making people uncomfortable and abusing her power. She'd probably be just as brutal

Â 
But Loras didn't think Brienne killed Renly in the show, he said so himself, so there was no need to go back there again. If anything I thought they wanted to remind us Brienne will go after Stannis at some point, but even that I don't know how relevant it is. Maybe if she's meant to meet Stannis at some point in the later books it is, but there's no way to know yet. But yeah, it definitely wasn't because anyone thought she killed Renly (although Joff's line about it was super funny).

Â 
Imo, this was the most in character Cersei has ever been since Blackwater. She wasn't after Brienne because of Jaime, Brienne irritated her because she's a lady who never had to master the curtsy, and she's free to roam and serve whatever lord she pleases, contrary to Cersei the former queen-regent to be married to her son's brother in law. It's only ooc if you look at it shallowy as Cersei being jealous.
2311	Le Cygne	2014-04-16	It really isn't cemented for me that Brienne loves Jaime until she has that dream where Renly transforms into Jaime after she's unconscious following her encounter with Biter. Â 

No, I think they are right on target here.  The whole time they were together they were developing feelings for each other.  The Oathkeeper scene has lots of undertones, I think GRRM was right to set that up.  He thinks her eyes are astonishing.  She gets flustered when he says blue is a good color on her, and says his white cloak becomes him.  
And throughout AFFC, she's thinking of him naked and a god, then she tries to think of Renly, so she knows she's thinking about Jaime the same way.  Everywhere she goes, she remembers when Jaime was there.  She dreams of him cloaking her (double meaning for her, that's part of the Westeros wedding ceremony) instead of Renly.  
Every other word to the Elder Brother is Jaime (and I bet that's how the Elder Brother heard about Sansa, when he found Sandor, and he couldn't shut up about her, either).  Throughout AFFC Brienne has beyond lost it, but it starts in ASOS.
2312	aceluby	2014-04-16	What I find fascinating is that even after the author called out the romantic connection that was clearly there in the books some are insisting it wasn't there.


Â 
The bear and the maiden fair.Â
2313	SlowLoras	2014-04-16	Personally, I read Brienne's reaction as an 'oh shit, you two really are doing the incestuous do' type thing rather than a 'oh shit, she knows I like him'.
Â 
That said, I'm not a Brienne/Jaime shipper but it seems pretty obvious that there's some manner of attraction there - on both sides (I seem to recall Jaime getting a hard-on while staring at Brienne's crotch in the books.)
2314	Fool of a Book	2014-04-16	Too many issues with Jaime and Brienne's "early" arrival in KL, and all of them are bad.
2315	Onna Lewyys	2014-04-16	It seemed to be based more around shared experience, admiration and trust.

Â 
This exactly. She and Jaime are about to be separated for like a season-and-a-half, and we will not be privy toÂ their inner thoughts while they're apart like in the book, soÂ the writers reallyÂ need to bring these feelings to the audience's attentionÂ now.

Â 
Yes, this is such a superÂ important element of the scene! Cersei resents her confinement to traditional female roles (not being taught to fight like Jaime when they were kids, constantly being married off like a "horse", etc.), and now she's suddenly presented with a woman who is doing exactly as she likes, regardless of societal pressures.Â The scene isÂ not just about Jaime. It's just that Jaime is the only real leverage thatÂ Cersei has over Brienne.
2316	Ser Creighton	2014-04-16	Did not enjoy that scene, it did not draw much of a reaction from me, but there was no build up to it. Now the part where Brie is wearing a matching jacket to Jaime's 3/4 leather duster had me laughing, would rather have more little things like that, then dropping a bomb like they did.
2317	Will&Chrismom	2014-04-16	Very good point about Cersei being jealous of Brienne, which is also hugely ironic: it's not as if Brienne isn't paying a pretty huge social price dressing as a man and going about as a knight, never mind that Brienne is homely. If Cersei were even slightly self-aware she might come to the conclusion that trying to live like Brienne might be more than she herself could handle. Cersei has always thought herself smarter and tougher than she really is.

Â 
Ehm... I don't understand, some people complain the scene was too "hitting over the head" and left all subtlety out, yet some people still don't get it? I'm not trying to be an arse, but what makes you deduce that Brienne thought about the incest (something she already knows of btw, since Jaime spelled it out as "I only ever fucked my sister" when he was speaking to her and Cat right before Cat freed him)? There's nothing dubious or ambiguous about that scene. She loves him, but until Cersei threw it in her face, she had never thought of it.Â

Â 

Â 
Agreed, and tbh I thought it wasn't about Jaime at all. Cersei was angry and wanted to put Brienne back in the kitchen where all women belong. She was losing her power, there's a new queen and that's why after going after Brienne she rushes to insult Pycelle, and exercise her power over Margaery's by having the food fed to the dogs. Everything was about her, not Jaime and not Brienne. She just happened to be right when she suggested Brienne loved Jaime, but I doubt she put any thought in it.
2319	jaimecersei	2014-04-16	i hated the brienne/cersei scene because it was such obvious fan-service and i hate love triangles. like i wouldn't have cared if they made it clear that brienne loves jaime from any other character but i hated that they had it to be cersei. ship jaime/brienne as much as you want but please leave cersei out of it.
Â 
it was honestly a scene out of some cheesy daytime soap opera or a CW teen show. judging anyone who thinks the scene was "deep" or "well-written". the tumblr metas on it have already been ridiculously embarrassing.Â

Why is it a love triangle? Do you actually believe Cersei cares or is remotely threatened? Also 
	Spoiler Brienne is leaving in episode 4
 so no triangle, obviously.
Â 
As for why it had to be Cersei, there's that scene in the books when Cersei finds out that instead of rushing to help her, Jaime took off with Brienne... It's a nice set up for her to know Brienne is in love with Jaime, it makes it more poignant for Cersei.
Â 
I ship Jaime and Brienne, but I'm a big fan of Cersei like you (and I also complained a lot the show took her agency away and made her sulk in a corner for most of season 3) and I loved that whole scene. If you read my earlier posts, for me that scene was all about Cersei.

look its totally cool you enjoyed the scene but i still think it was cheesy, fan-servicey and generally horrible. it was such an obvious trope too. i liked that cersei only saw brienne from afar in the books and would have preferred if they had kept it that way on the show.
Â 
and i fucking hate the idea that cersei knows that jaime doesnt rescue her because he's love with brienne. so cliche and cheesy. i like how in the book cersei thinks that jaime would be too shallow to run off with someone like brienne. makes sense with her internalized misogyny. cersei knowing that jaime loves brienne makes it love-triangley. i hated it. it was bad writing, and i'm going to stick with that.

2326	MadQueenAmberTargaryen	2014-04-16	I agree that one of the huge pros about Brienne and Jaime was that the books were so good that you could tell without anyone having to go and spell it out like Cersei in the TV series. Until the last episode, I really thought the cast and storyline was doing alright with Brienne/Jaime.. LeSigh~
2327	SlowLoras	2014-04-16	Â 
Ehm... I don't understand, some people complain the scene was too "hitting over the head" and left all subtlety out, yet some people still don't get it? I'm not trying to be an arse, but what makes you deduce that Brienne thought about the incest (something she already knows of btw, since Jaime spelled it out as "I only ever fucked my sister" when he was speaking to her and Cat right before Cat freed him)? There's nothing dubious or ambiguous about that scene. She loves him, but until Cersei threw it in her face, she had never thought of it.Â 


Â 
Well, short of Cersei saying "You love him, don't you?" and Brienne replying "well shit, yes, I guess I do, only I never thought about it before", I'd say there's always going to be room for a certain degree of interpretation. And as my post implied, I'm already coming at this as someone who thinks there's obviously something between Jaime and Brienne. She's already been shown to be a tad naive, believing that the world ought to work by the honour system she herself operates under - her time with Jaime is almost like a gradual peeling away of that naivety, witnessing brutality and darkness and stripping her of her preconceptions. Jaime is simultaneously a kingslayer and a good man. The phrase 'true knight' means very little. It's not entirely unthinkable that Brienne might have dismissed Jaime's talk of Cersei as the ramblings of a broken (but smitten) man until she was confronted with the truth of it.
Â 
But, to the more literal interpretation of the scene - I find it hard to believe Brienne hadn't considered her feelings for Jaime beforehand. Her shock, imo, is more likely to have come from Cersei correctly guessing and calling her on it - Brienne's a stoic, reserved woman, used to keeping her feelings under wraps. Cersei got under her skin and plucked out that secret in one go.

Â 
You misunderstand me, we don't know whether Jaime returns her feelings or not as it's ambiguous in the books, but I think it would be more poignant for Cersei to know he's with someone who's in love with him. I liked her reaction in the books as well, but they've changed so many things anyway, I don't find this to be too bad. But hey, I'm not trying to change your mind.

Well, in the books she pushes those feelings away. For instance she thinks of Jaime and forces herself to think of Renly. She wants to stay unaware because it's scary and doesn't want to face it. So it wouldn't be a stretch that in the show she did the same thing, and only came to terms with it once it's thrown in her face.

how the hell is that more poignant??? at that point in the books, cersei is about to publicly sexually humiliated in the most degrading and misogynistic way possible. the walk of shame was akin to sexual abuse, and she's hoping for the man that she cares about to come and rescue her. her knowing that jaime is with someone who he's in love with just cheapens that entire situation. and they'll probably show her as a jealous psycho bitch. wow i grow more and more disillusioned with this series and fandom day by day, i'm beginning to hate myself for ever getting interested in got/asoiaf in the first place ughÂ

um another woman being involved is just stupid and cheesy though. look there's no way we're going to come to an agreement on this so lets just call it a day okay.
Â 
either way i honestly think the reason they've changed the altar scene into rather rapey and forceful is because it makes it easier for them to make jaime/brienne happen because they're lazy writers. and they probably think that sexual abuse is a ~grey area~ or some bullshit like that because they're clearly still pushing the redemption thing with jaime this season. so i'm sure you'll get your jaime/brienne romance on the show.Â
2338	Vegeta_Greyjoy	2014-04-16	I don't mind it. I think it will set up Brienne's adventures with Pod in the latter part of this season as well as the next. Instead of the Bloody Mummers it will be random Lannister extras trying to kill Brienne and bring back Sansa.

its because D&D are flop lazy writers thats why. totally agree with that its a baffling choice. but since the oathekeeper episode is the next episode after altar rape/dubcon then i'm guessing they're trying to show cersei brings out the worst in jaime and brienne brings out the best.
Â 
like i said before i wouldnt be surprised if they think that sexual abuse is a grey area or something. i'm sure a lot of people are going to enjoy it anyways since they made cersei out to be an irrational bitch in the first episode who won't fuck him because he "took too long" to get back to her when he was imprisoned

dude most people saw her as an irrational bitch in that scene. not saying its my opinion, but i follow closely with reviews and stuff and thats how most people saw it as. plus she went crazy during the purple wedding. a lot of people are going to see her as the irrational bitch who wont have sex with him next week. thats just the way D&D set it up because they're dumb
2344	SeventySeven	2014-04-16	Was Cersei an irrational bitch? Everything did change, she's not sleeping with him for lots of reasons. Also, and I didn't really agree with this change myself, but show!Cersei really doesn't love Jaime all that much... Show!Cersei was in love with Robert. Jaime is like the guy she can fall on, but in the show canon she's really not as into him as he's into her.

Â to be honest i hate a lot of the changes they've made to show!cersei but for 3 seasons they had her missing jaime and wanting him to come back to her. so when he comes back and she says stuff like "you took too long" when she clearly knows he was a prisoner of war does make her seem rather irrational and she looks terrible when jaime had just given away casterly rock to be with her. thats how most people saw it and i cant exactly blame them for seeing it that way.Â 
Â 
idk i'm just fully expecting the altar scene to be framed in a way that makes jaime look sympathetic rather than cersei considering the characterization of her in the past two episodes regarding jaime.Â

Â 
Why do you care what clearly stupid people think? David and Dan didn't "Set up" anything of the sort. Listen to Cersei's lines that they wrote for her. If you perceive that to be an irrational woman who has no point and is denying sex to be a bitch (seriously?), then the problem is with you, and unfortunately you're the dumb one.Â 
Â 
Please, the Cersei in the books is much more of a manipulative and irrational bitch than D&D's version. Also GRRM wrote those Purple Wedding Cersei scenes, which unsurprisingly were the bitchiest she's been since Blackwater (Guess who wrote that) because that's how George envisions that character.

2347	Ed Mike	2014-04-16	Â What bothers me most on the scene is that it shows that Brienne's amazing arc searching Sansa will be much shorter on the series.
Â Brienne isn't even clearly in love with Jaime at that point. Is when he makes good on his promise to save the Stark girls sending Brienne after Sansa and after present Brienne with a sword, which she sees -acordingly- as a recognition of her as a fellow warrior, that she lowers her guard.
Â Even so, is just while traveling with Podrik and her ex-suitor that she starts to notice that she thinks more on Jaime than on Renly day by day. The realization is slow and, to be fair, is not a full blown out "Crap, I love that man!" even while Lady Stoneheart is demanding her to bring Jaime.
Â 
Â I know we can't clearly see inner thoughts on a show, but they jumped over the bridge whit that talk.
Â 
Â Shipers, calm down, is not that others are "blind to the cuty cuty love, you munsters!", we all know that Brienne will probablye end up figuring out what she feels and perhaps even rolling a little on the grass. When I say that Jaime and Brienne is not so clearly a romantic relation, I mean that they may end up as a tragedy, a bromance or a chivalry romance ("look, don't touch"), instead of the kind of meet-me-on-that-discreet-inn romance so many readers are waiting for. I'm not so certain they will do something out of that sweet pink love or even fully acknowledgingÂ it before one of them die and I'm sure there will be no wedding for them, as much as I like them both very much. So I won't join the knitting circle on making booties for their babies.
Â 
Brienne is living, again, in the lands of platonic love, and Jaime not only never beded any non-Cersei woman, he also is trying to became a worthy Kingsguard in an atempt to regain the kind of happiness and joyfulness he had when he was as naive as Brienne, and to be the "real deal" White Knight, keeping his pants is suposed to be part of the job.
Â A hot love is not going to do any good to him now, the dude needs to regain some self-respect.
Â They may have a hot rendez vouz coming their way, but that's not why I like ther characters so much, in the least.

My observations are, most people are just enjoying the story as it plays out.
2350	IlAovatar	2014-04-16	I was bothered more by her interaction with Joffrey.
Â 
It seemed so forced and awkward. I hate it when show producers feel they need to have main characters come together like that.
2351	TheFullmetalAlchemist	2014-04-16	Agreed. The whole thing felt like something right out of a soap opera.
2352	Le Cygne	2014-04-16	Well, that wouldn't be the first time. Might as well be something some of us wanted to see.
2353	mcmnky	2014-04-16	I think I would have written a line for Brienne where she says something to Cersei like "I admire Jaime as a knight". Something simple like that. Full blown "Oh shit, I love him and I'm being confronted about it," seems too rushed.And then when she's leaving KL she can say something to Jaime like, "You've really proven me wrong, you do have honor." And then when she's traveling the rode looking for a her sister a maid of three and ten, she can confess to her fellow travelers that she met a true knight, and she admires him. And then the dream sequence and then her defending Jaime to Lady Stoneheart and the BWB. Tada... developed over time.I hope it doesn't play out like that, because it has no credibility. Jamie was released in exchange for Sansa and Arya. And yet, there he is in KL and not even mentioning returning Sansa to her family. And the Brienne of the show also has no honor. I don't mean she should be seen talking to Sansa during the wedding celebration, but some point, shouldn't she say something to someone?? I was shocked when that conversation ended without any word to Cersei about the oath she and Jamie had made.In the books Brienne is a tragic figure, but in the show she is a joke. She's as a flighty as a teenager with a different favorite band each day.And now traveling in search of a maid of three and ten years? How can she do that now? You didn't give 2 words for Sansa when she was right in front of you, but now you need to undertake this "quest"? For your "honor"?Yes, I know, as Tyrion's wife, it's not as easy as taking Sansa's hand and walking out the front gate, but at least try, you know? I think that whole story line--Jaimie giving the sword to Brienne and her hunt for Sansa--has to be abandoned. It doesn't make any sense given what those characters have done since returning to KL.
2354	Le Cygne	2014-04-16	I am just pretending it never happened.Â  Their real story starts next episode.Â Jaime never killed Alton, either, just saying.Â  I'll never accept that, even for show Jaime.
					
					
							Edited by Le Cygne, 16 April 2014 - 10:46 PM.
2355	KeeperOfOaths	2014-04-17	The scene was nice. I donÂ´t understand all the negative fuss about it.
Â 
I didnÂ´t read BrienneÂ´s reaction as a "Shit,Â I love him!!! I read it as "What is this woman talking about? How am I supossed to answer this?" and, after a pause, "Could she be right?". I donÂ´t think that Brienne realizes at this point that she loves Jaime. She is in denial. It is, however, the first time that she considers it. So, the scene is in perfect accordance with the books. It shouldnÂ´t be a problem for book readers.
Â 
As regards the unsullied, I think this scene works perfectly for them, as well.Â They loved J and B in season 3. They probably didnÂ´t see them as a romantic pair, but they loved them. Then came the scene in in 4.01 with "are you sure that we are not related?" and a lot of them asked themselves whether Jaime was actually flirting with Brienne (because of the whole incest stuff). Then we have this scene where Cercei tells Brienne that she loves Jaime andÂ Brienne doesnÂ´t answer. For some of the unsullied this sceneÂ was like "what, she loves him him? where has this come from?" and for others itÂ was just "Cercei is a bitch and she speaks nonsense". I think they donÂ´t buy the whole J/B in love at this point.
Â 
BUTTTT, then we will have episode 4. Where Jaime will give Brienne the armour, and the sword, and he will send her on her quest. And then he will go with her to say good-bye and he will be Â sad to watch her go. And she will look totally devastated. And then, THEY WILL BUY IT. At least they will see that there really is something else there and they will continue to watch J and B looking for clues that, yes, they might actually love each other. And with each time that Brienne will mention Jaime and with each time that Jaime mentions Brienne, they will believe it more and more.
Â 
As for the book readers who do not believe that Brienne loves Jaime, what can I say? If you donÂ´t see it, you donÂ´t see it. But perhaps you shoud read the books again.

Yeah I am surprised at it. I thought it was quite clear that she was so set upon seeing herself as the strong honourable 'knightly' type that she she didn't know how to process what she felt, and GC did a great job here. I just thought the scene itself was problematic given its timing not because of its content.

Agreed, and tbh I thought it wasn't about Jaime at all. Cersei was angry and wanted to put Brienne back in the kitchen where all women belong. She was losing her power, there's a new queen and that's why after going after Brienne she rushes to insult Pycelle, and exercise her power over Margaery's by having the food fed to the dogs. Everything was about her, not Jaime and not Brienne. She just happened to be right when she suggested Brienne loved Jaime, but I doubt she put any thought in it.


Â 
It was not about Jaime at the beginning. I agree that at the beginning it was as you said: Cercei being jealous of the frredom Brienne had being a knight etc. But once Brienne said in such a sweet voice that Jaime has rescued her MORE THAN ONCE, it became about Jaime too. She realized that there is something there, that Jaime has rescued a woman he was not supposed to rescue and that Jaime has not told her about it, so she became jealous and suspicios about this connection too. Jealous not in the sens thst Cercei loves Jaime so much and she canÂ´t live without him, but in the sense that Cercei wants to be the center of JaimeÂ´s life and resents the idea of any woman taking what she considers to be hers.

2360	KeeperOfOaths	2014-04-17	Â 
how the hell is that more poignant??? at that point in the books, cersei is about to publicly sexually humiliated in the most degrading and misogynistic way possible. the walk of shame was akin to sexual abuse, and she's hoping for the man that she cares about to come and rescue her. her knowing that jaime is with someone who he's in love with just cheapens that entire situation. and they'll probably show her as a jealous psycho bitch. wow i grow more and more disillusioned with this series and fandom day by day, i'm beginning to hate myself for ever getting interested in got/asoiaf in the first place ughÂ 


This is your interpretation, of course. As far as I see it, she doesnÂ´t give a shit about Jaime. It is all about her. When he doesnÂ´tÂ do as she wants, she sends him away and doesnÂ´t care shit about what he is doing. When she is in real danger, then she thinks abiut him and asks him to help her. And tries to manipulate him byÂ telling him that she loves him.Â Even the whole, "Jaime will not leave me;we will die together as we were born", is about her. She considers herself so wonderful, that it is actually impossible for Jaime to leave her and to let her behind. But hey, this discussion, I guess, should be for another thread.
2361	SeventySeven	2014-04-17	Â What bothers me most on the scene is that it shows that Brienne's amazing arc searching Sansa will be much shorter on the series.
Â 
Â Brienne isn't even clearly in love with Jaime at that point. Is when he makes good on his promise to save the Stark girls sending Brienne after Sansa and after present Brienne with a sword, which she sees -acordingly- as a recognition of her as a fellow warrior, that she lowers her guard.
Â Even so, is just while traveling with Podrik and her ex-suitor that she starts to notice that she thinks more on Jaime than on Renly day by day. The realization is slow and, to be fair, is not a full blown out "Crap, I love that man!" even while Lady Stoneheart is demanding her to bring Jaime.
Â 
Â I know we can't clearly see inner thoughts on a show, but they jumped over the bridge whit that talk.
Â 
Â Shipers, calm down, is not that others are "blind to the cuty cuty love, you munsters!", we all know that Brienne will probablye end up figuring out what she feels and perhaps even rolling a little on the grass. When I say that Jaime and Brienne is not so clearly a romantic relation, I mean that they may end up as a tragedy, a bromance or a chivalry romance ("look, don't touch"), instead of the kind of meet-me-on-that-discreet-inn romance so many readers are waiting for. I'm not so certain they will do something out of that sweet pink love or even fully acknowledgingÂ it before one of them die and I'm sure there will be no wedding for them, as much as I like them both very much. So I won't join the knitting circle on making booties for their babies.
Â 
Brienne is living, again, in the lands of platonic love, and Jaime not only never beded any non-Cersei woman, he also is trying to became a worthy Kingsguard in an atempt to regain the kind of happiness and joyfulness he had when he was as naive as Brienne, and to be the "real deal" White Knight, keeping his pants is suposed to be part of the job.
Â A hot love is not going to do any good to him now, the dude needs to regain some self-respect.
Â They may have a hot rendez vouz coming their way, but that's not why I like ther characters so much, in the least.


Â 
BIB: I'm with you on that one. I understand the need to cut some of it, but since they invent so much useless material for so many characters I would have preferred they came up with something invented for Brienne as well, and have her journey longer. By the look of things she'll meet LSH this season...
Â 
As for your other points, dude you assume a lot. I've yet to come across a j/b shipper who thinks these 2 will have a happy ever after and make lots of babies, so I don't know what you're talking about. We've all read the books, we all know wishing for actual happy endings is a waste of time. That doesn't mean 2 characters can't fall in love, even if it ends in tragedy.Â 
Â 
And btw, we don't know when Brienne started to fall for Jaime, because she had no POV in asos, so your guess is as good as mine. There's no evidence in the text that her feelings start to grow after he gives her the quest, if anything the way she talks about the way he looked during the bath tub scene and her reaction of blushing and being shy when he gives her oathkeeper, indicates he was already growing on her. Brienne trying to push her feelings away because she's too scared to confront them is probably part of the show as well, the difference is that they can't have her slowly realise she does. It's part of the difference in the mediums (we're not inside her head).
Â 


The scene was nice. I donÂ´t understand all the negative fuss about it.
Â 
Â 
As regards the unsullied, I think this scene works perfectly for them, as well.Â They loved J and B in season 3. They probably didnÂ´t see them as a romantic pair, but they loved them. Then came the scene in in 4.01 with "are you sure that we are not related?" and a lot of them asked themselves whether Jaime was actually flirting with Brienne (because of the whole incest stuff). Then we have this scene where Cercei tells Brienne that she loves Jaime andÂ Brienne doesnÂ´t answer. For some of the unsullied this sceneÂ was like "what, she loves him him? where has this come from?" and for others itÂ was just "Cercei is a bitch and she speaks nonsense". I think they donÂ´t buy the whole J/B in love at this point.
Â 


Â 
BIB:There's no fuss really, if you read most of the posts in this thread is people who read the books saying Brienne being in love with Jaime is book canon and hard to miss.Â 
Â 
I don't know if the unsullied aren't buying it, most of my unsullied just enjoy the storylines wherever they go. The intention of this scene was to plant a seed concerning how Brienne's feelings had grown for Jaime, that's it.
Â 
Â 


Â 
Yeah I am surprised at it. I thought it was quite clear that she was so set upon seeing herself as the strong honourable 'knightly' type that she she didn't know how to process what she felt, and GC did a got job here. I just thought the scene itself was problematic given its timing not because of its content.


Â 
The timing because it's too early? I think in this case they had no choice in terms of timing. As others have pointed out, Brienne being in KL with Sansa at the same time and doing nothing is much more of a writing oversight.
Â

Party because it is too early but I think I feel it is off kilter because of Cersei's previous rejection of Jaime and now we find out that her jealousy of Brienne is a driving factor.


Â 
I wrote it already, but I don't think Cersei was meant to look jealous of Jaime&Brienne. She's envious of Brienne's freedom, as the first thing she does when she approaches her is telling her she might not call herself a lady but she is. She's trying to put her in her place because she's annoyed she's losing power and a new queen has replaced her, so she lashes out at as many people as she can i.e. Brienne, Pycelle, Oberyn, and tries to undermine Margaery as a queen. If there's anything about Jaime, it's the irritation that instead of being there with her, he was somewhere else saving Brienne more than once, like "how dares Jaime leaving me here in trouble and waste time saving this chick when I needed help". Not because she's super in love with him.
2364	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-17	Oh I agree with that about Brienne's freedom. It is something Cersei never had and is supported by her 'Father, please don't make me do it again" line.Â 
Â 
But from this scene, the way the 'Do you love him?' is played then sets up one reason for her original rejection of Jaime. If it played out that way on the page it could work as the reasons are exposed, but on screen I just find doing it in that order to be problematic.

Â 
But, but... SUBVERSION OF TROPES!!!111!
2370	Will&Chrismom	2014-04-17	It begs the question: yes, Brienne and Sansa are both in KL, but what exactly is Brienne supposed to do here? Yes, she could have approached Sansa briefly at some point during the wedding, but apart from that?
Â 
Brienne has no sway or power in KL. She is basically under the protection of Jaime at this point. The whole point of her convo with Jaime last week, about Sansa, was pressuring HIM to do something, b/c he's the only one of them in a position to do something. Brienne has enough experience with court life, certainly, not to do anything stupid while she's in what may be somewhat hostile territory. My takeaway was that she deferred to Jaime's judgment: she can be annoyed at him for not doing anything, but in this instance she's not going to challenge him and spirit Sansa away or something.
Â 
As for Brienne loving Jaime: I never took that scene for Brienne to realize "Wait, I DO love him" and more, "Wait, what?" Brienne has NO sense of what real love actually is. Poor girl, the only people who seem to have actually showed real love for her are her dad and the guy who taught her how to fight with a sword. Her notions of loving a man are pure Courtly Love with a healthy side of He Was Nice to Me! So she's infatuated with Renly b/c she saw him as this shining example of honor and greatness (and his handsomeness certainly helped things) but he also treated her decently and with respect (at least to her face) and made her a knight of his own royal guard.Â 
Â 
So now Jaime, who's completely different than Renly and who Brienne actually knows on a deep level, as a person and not just a symbol of something, is somebody she would probably admit freely, prior to Cersei's accusation, that she regards very highly. But love? It would never occur to her. Love is the logical thing you feel for people like Renly who are perfect and wonderful. It's not messy and complicated and directed at people who are messy and complicated, like Jaime. Brienne has no mature understanding of love. If Cersei achieved nothing else with her commentary it's that Brienne now has to face up to her own complicated feelings about Jaime, feelings that prior to that moment were almost certainly, in Brienne's mind, pretty simple and straightforward.

Â

I am saying it because I have read unsullied threads and I have also spoken with colleagues.

So, I think it was not only a great scene, but also an important scene.

Â 
I just meant that the people who are complaining about it are either people who hate the idea of Brienne being in love with Jaime, hate romance, hate everythingÂ  
Â 
I agree with you that it was a good scene and an important one, especially in light of what's to come for Brienne when she meets UnCat. It's important that we know how she feels towards Jaime, so we can understand how that choice impacts her.
Â 
By the same token though, we should have seen how important Cat is to her as well, it's a shame so far we haven't (although she clearly really wants to keep her promise).
2373	JonBranRickon	2014-04-17	Two thoughts on the Cersei and Brienne scene:
Â 
The TV show can not spend an enormous amount of time with context and so they haveto plant seeds of why something may happen in the future.Â  In the book you can be much more subtle.Â  This may lead to a confrontation between C&B in the future books,
Â 
If you haven't noticed, the same thing is happening with Theon, where he has made references to Eddard being his real father and the scene in the barber chair where he was visibly turn over Rob's death.Â

This, exactly. It's like some people think romance and immediately assume it's going be all cliche-y and cheesy, but grrm doesn't write romance that way at all (contrary to the show's own creation Robb/TalisaÂ  Â ), and yes it's very much part of the characters and just one of the many layers of human emotions.
2377	Onna Lewyys	2014-04-17	Then came the scene in in 4.01 with "are you sure that we are not related?"

Now THAT was some bad writing.


Â 
now that was BRILLIANT writing.  Achieving so much with so little.
Â 
Going back to C/B scene, I think it is brilliant writing too, because it achieves a lot of things with very few lines:
Â 
1. it gives us more insight into CerceiÂ´s character. It shows her as the insecure frustrated woman that she is, and not as the powerful, glamorous queen that she wants to appear. She is frustrated by her condition as a woman, by her inability to chose her destiny freely, by her inability to fight her enemies with a sword in her hand and not only with words and plots. Brienne represents, from a POV, everything that Cercei wanted to be and to have. So, being the bitch that she is-sorry but this is how I see it- she takes it on Brienne.
Â 
2. it gives us more insight into BrienneÂ´s character. We see her as a shy, closed woman, not fit for social interaction, and less for the KL kind of interaction. She is a great warrior, but she is a shy woman, who is not very capable of fighting with words the way she fights with her sword.
Â 
3. it gives us insight into Cercei-Jaime relationship. Yes, she rejected him. But this doesnÂ´t mean that she is willing to let him escape her influence and power. Hence the need to bitch out Brienne some more.
Â 
4. it gives us a little insight into Jaime-Brienne relationship. He didnÂ´t tell Cercei about rescuing Brienne. He kept it for himself, as something private between him and Brienne. Which is nice.
Â 
5. it shows that Brienne is very grateful to Jaime for rescuing her MORE than once. Which is really nice and something I liked a lot. Because we didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t get to see Brienne thanking Jaime for saving her. On the contrary, when they say good-bye in Harenhall, he tells her that he has a debt with her. Which bothered me a little. Because the debt had been paid. he rescued her from rape, she rescued him from dying. After Harrenhall, Brienne is the one who has a debt with Jaime. I am glad to see her being grateful to him.
Â 
6. It plants the seed of something more between Brienne and Jaime. She speaks so fondly of him.
2379	Onna Lewyys	2014-04-17	^ Excellent analysis! Really spot on.
2380	Le Cygne	2014-04-17	5. it shows that Brienne is very grateful to Jaime for rescuing her MORE than once. Which is really nice and something I liked a lot.

Which bothered me a little. Because the debt had been paid. he rescued her from rape, she rescued him from dying.

I like all of your points, but this is important, we finally got some closure for the bearpit scene. That was missing when they cut "You are still maiden, I hope?" which was Jaime hoping he had gotten there in time, and spared her the horror of rape.
And when they cut this, which was closure:
Â 

"I am grateful, but... you were well away. Why come back?"
A dozen quips came to mind, each crueler than the one before, but Jaime only shrugged. "I dreamed of you," he said.

Â 
And this is the second time she's been surprised and clearly moved by him being so good to her, and saying thank you.Â  This author loves repetition, he always hammers in points again and again.Â  Here she is before, when he makes up the sapphires story:
Â 

Two nights passed in silence before the wench finally found the courage to whisper, "Jaime? Why did you shout out?"
Â 
"Why did I shout 'sapphires,' you mean? Use your wits, wench. Would this lot have cared if I shouted 'rape'?"
Â 
"You did not need to shout at all."...
Â 
"A good thing for you Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m such a liar. An honorable man would have told the truth about the Sapphire Isle."
Â 
"All the same," she said. "I thank you, ser."

She is frustrated by her condition as a woman, by her inability to chose her destiny freely, by her inability to fight her enemies with a sword in her hand and not only with words and plots. Brienne represents, from a POV, everything that Cercei wanted to be and to have. So, being the bitch that she is-sorry but this is how I see it- she takes it on Brienne.
Â 
2. it gives us more insight into BrienneÂ´s character. We see her as a shy, closed woman, not fit for social interaction, and less for the KL kind of interaction. She is a great warrior, but she is a shy woman, who is not very capable of fighting with words the way she fights with her sword.
Â 
3. it gives us insight into Cercei-Jaime relationship. Yes, she rejected him. But this doesnÂ´t mean that she is willing to let him escape her influence and power. Hence the need to bitch out Brienne some more.
Â 
4. it gives us a little insight into Jaime-Brienne relationship. He didnÂ´t tell Cercei about rescuing Brienne. He kept it for himself, as something private between him and Brienne. Which is nice.
Â 
5. it shows that Brienne is very grateful to Jaime for rescuing her MORE than once. Which is really nice and something I liked a lot. Because we didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t get to see Brienne thanking Jaime for saving her. On the contrary, when they say good-bye in Harenhall, he tells her that he has a debt with her. Which bothered me a little. Because the debt had been paid. he rescued her from rape, she rescued him from dying. After Harrenhall, Brienne is the one who has a debt with Jaime. I am glad to see her being grateful to him.
Â 
6. It plants the seed of something more between Brienne and Jaime. She speaks so fondly of him.

its just BAFFLING to me how anyone think its a well written scene. just because theres a HBO label attached to it and there are british accents involved does not mean its a ~quality~
Â 
i also think that people are looking for depth in that scene that isnt there. the scene is basically , cersei making fun of brienne because she isn't a "proper" lady and "do you love jaime?????". it doesnt take a genius to write that basic shit.
Â 
a well written scene between cersei and brienne could have been something like cersei watching brienne while she's fighting or something. she approaches brienne, sort of bitterly asks/taunts her about being a knight. brienne lets it slip how her father had always been so kind and supportive of her. which tywin was not when it came to cersei weilding a sword. there's some original thought there, it fleshes out brienne's character and cersei's as well. shows how two women adapted in different ways in a patriarchal society etc. i dont even care if i sound arrogant, but THATS good writing.

But replace swordfighting with bowing, and you essentially have the scene as written in the show, only less subtle and minus one single line about Brienne loving Jaime.

Well, I live in Britain so I'm not particularly charmed by English accents so you can scrap that.
Â 
Look, I don't have to convince you to like it, you don't and that's fine. The scene might have not played EXACTLY as you wanted it, but all of those things you suggest in your "good writing" are there in the episode. Cersei already knows Brienne's dad allowed her to learn how to fight, otherwise she wouldn't be doing what she is, this is just logic. What sets Cersei off is Brienne saying she never had to master the curtsy; Cersei is controlled by the men around her and she's being replaced by a new queen, whereas Brienne is free.
Â 
If I were you I wouldn't spend this much time debating something I hate.

What a pity, jaimecersei, I guess you will remain baffled. hahaha. It is also very interesting how you came to the conclusion that people like that scene because it has the HBO label on it and British accents. What an insight!! And what do the Britsh accents have to do with anything? Do you have a sort of inferiority complex or something?

2390	KeeperOfOaths	2014-04-17	I like all of your points, but this is important, we finally got some closure for the bearpit scene. That was missing when they cut "You are still maiden, I hope?" which was Jaime hoping he had gotten there in time, and spared her the horror of rape.
And when they cut this, which was closure:
Â 
Â 
And this is the second time she's been surprised and clearly moved by him being so good to her, and saying thank you.Â  This author loves repetition, he always hammers in points again and again.Â  Here she is before, when he makes up the sapphires story:
Â 


yeah, right? He saved her more than once and she didn't thank him; in the movie, I mean. The goodbye scene was nice, but I felt that the balance between them in that scene was not right. They were at least even at that point. But the way they showed it was as if Jaime was still in debt with her. So yes, I liked that she acknowledged his help in this C/B scene.
Â 
Also, I agree with what you and SeventySeven said about J/B. It is unlikely that they will have a happy ending. But one can only hope that at least they both survive the books. AndÂ  maybe, maybe they have a sort of happy ending. Pleasee  But yes, a kiss, more kisses, more than that, before it ends in disaster or whatever, it would be nice.

To your first point: it is generally not a good debate technique to make assumptions about others who disagree with you.Â 
Â 
To your second and third points: I don't see how your reconstructed scene adds any further information about either character than the one GRRM laid down, but more to the point, unless the entire wedding sequence was reconstructed to include a Knights' Tourney, why on earth would Brienne be engaged in sword play of any sort? You can't argue what a great scene your scene is when it would not even have proper context. Knights' Tourneys and weddings generally don't go together, especially since the winners of tourneys are supposed to be paid so handsomely and you have both Tywin and Olenna bitching about how expensive the wedding has been.Â 
Â 
Brienne has no reason whatsoever to be doing anything but showing up as a clean, well-dressed guest of a royal wedding, offering her good wishes, and fading into the woodwork again, as much as she reasonably can, considering. She is not there to draw attention to herself.
2392	SlowLoras	2014-04-17	lmao at the thirsty jaime/brienne shippers defending that terrible writing. i have things that i like as well, but i'm not delusional about them.


Â 
hm, well perhaps if I can offer my two cents, as someone ambivalent towards Jaime/Brienne...
Â 
I thought the scene worked well for several reasons. Firstly, it illustrates that Jaime is Cersei's 'hot button' - she's generally quite subtle when it comes to snark, slipping in little digs and quips into conversation. But when it's something she's emotionally invested in - her son, for example (check out her total lack of subtlety when she puts Margaery in her place) or Jaime, she goes for the jugular. Cersei's no stranger to bluntness, nor to rudeness - and her treatment of Brienne is both of those things. Cersei has two reasons to be jealous of Brienne.
Â 
Firstly, the obvious regard she and Jaime have for one another - Cersei sees treachery everywhere, so even if you were to assume Jaime and Brienne maintained a purely platonic respect for one another, it stands to reason that Cersei would see something else. She's in an insecure position as Queen Regent, surrounded by Tyrells. Secondly - and this is more evident in the books - Cersei constantly bemoans being born female. Not because she has any real desire to be a man, but because she wants to command the same respect and authority as a man. Here's Brienne, who seeks the same thing but is a great deal more proactive (and in some ways effective) at getting it. She bows instead of curtseys, wears masculine clothing, fights better than a lot of men and wears her strength and relative 'masculinity' as a point of pride. Cersei can be beautiful and queenly and desirable, or she can be masculine, but to her mind she cannot be both. That Jaime might even consider, as an outside possibility, this masculine/feminine hybrid as a potential sexual partner - eschewing Jaime in the process - is something Cersei just cannot comprehend.
Â 
But what is Cersei's talent? Picking out a person's weakness. And Brienne is certainly not comfortable in her own skin, at least not to the point where she'd consider herself worthy of Jaime's attentions (or Renly's, for that matter.) So Cersei zeroes in on this - when she realises her mockery of Brienne's masculinity has fallen flat, she goes for the throat. She hears Brienne speak almost fondly of Jaime and latches on to this. I'd say her 'you love him' was a shot in the dark that hit its target, but Cersei's cleverer and more intuitive than that. Brienne is reserved, but she also wears her heart on her sleeve - she's honest, honourable, and her affection for Jaime (whether platonic or romantic) is clear and obvious. I don't think it's bad writing to have Cersei come out and seize on this so bluntly - I think it's pretty in-character for Cersei, and Brienne's reaction (stunned silence) is also in character - I'm still not convinced Brienne hadn't realised it herself, but she's pushed those feelings down and suppressed them for so long that she's come to believe that it's invisible to others. To be sussed out so thoroughly in such a short space of time...well, it's going to be intensely unnerving, especially now Brienne's left to consider the potential consequences of this piece of information going public,
Â 
Just my thoughts.
2393	Fevre River Warrior	2014-04-17	I think it is a fabulous scene. Christie played Brienne's reaction brilliantly - she is not sure of her feeling for Jaimie and has to sort that one out. But Cersei asks Brienne if she loves him the way a jealous lover would - not a sister. Brienne begins to realize that maybe the rumors about Cersei and Jamie are true.....(I love Loras' comment to Jamie as well).
Â 
Cersei is fascinated by this woman and her ties to Jamie....and Brienne is the exact opposite of Cersei in every way.
Â 
It is my opinion that Jamie is the Valinquor (spelling?) and he will be the one to kill Cersei, and it will be because of Brienne. That is just my opinon.
2394	KeeperOfOaths	2014-04-17	Good post, SlowLoras. I agree.
Â 
Personally I hope that it won't be Jaime who kills Cercei. I don't want him to have her blood on his hands. It would be too much of a burden for the rest of his life.
2395	Le Cygne	2014-04-17	Also, I agree with what you and SeventySeven said about J/B. It is unlikely that they will have a happy ending.

Yeah, GRRM is going to follow up with something, he's got to, you don't just put a "gentler than Cersei" moment out there in a story, then never come back to it.
Â 
And with these subtle romances, to show story progression while they are apart, I can't imagine they'd not take advantage of the opportunities to cut from a scene with one to another.
Â 
So, just to pick one here, Brienne sobbing about Jaime to the Elder Brother, while Jaime revisits the bear pit and smacks the crap out of Red Ronnet (or some show equivalent).Â
2396	The Boar of Gore	2014-04-18	Brienne shouldn't even be in King's Landing because she has nothing to do there, and it forces her to confront a reality that was skillfully avoided in the book, namely, the fact that Jaime was screwing his own sister. Because, come on, anyone's gut reaction to that is going to be a queasy feeling followed by a swift disinvestment of emotion in their former love-interest. Basically, the show put her in that scene with Cersei so they could state for the camera "You love him" (which the audience knew anyway) and yet they've made it much less believable.

Thank you? Neither Jaime nor Brienne should be there just yet, the show has changed the timeline. Whay is skillfully avoided in the books isn't Brienne knowing about Jaime&Cersei, as other posters have pointed out she knows both in the show and in the books, they avoided the ridiculous situation of having them at KL at the same time at Sansa, and not really doing much much about... And that's awkward.
2400	Onna Lewyys	2014-04-18	Yes, everything would have been so much better if D&D had structured their storyline last season so that the bear pit happened in Ep 9 or 10, then have them sit out these first two episodes and get back to KL this coming Sunday. Problem solved.

I'm still not sure what she CAN do.Â  She's petitioned Jamie to do something.Â  Sansa is lawfully married now, and there are (as far as Brienne knows) no Starks to return her to anyway.Â  Should Brienne kidnap her and take her to Tarth?Â  Her father wouldn't thank her for that.Â  Brienne has no contacts or influence anywhere else, how can she alone stand against the Lannisters?Â  One of the greatest Houses of the realm has been extinguished for kidnapping Tyrion...she's now to steal his wife?
Â 
And she has no way to know how to sneak out of the Red Keep, much less the city as a whole.Â  And sneaking is not her forte in any event.
Â 
She could petition the King to do something, I suppose...but do what?Â  Send her to the Eyrie?Â  Pretty insulting to House Lannister.
Â 
Finding Sansa on the road and getting her to the Eyrie is one thing (probably also impossible), or getting her to wherever Sansa may wish, I suppose. But I see no course of action open to her while Sansa is with her lawful husband and surrounded by lions.

No, I know neither Jaime or Brienne can do much about it in practical facts, but it's absurd Brienne didn't approach Sansa if anything to let her know Cat was trying to get her and Arya back. In the books Cat dying is a pretty major event for Brienne, the fact that it's been so far glossed over in the show is silly. Especially because Brienne and Cat will meet again, I think it would have been more important for Brienne to show she's mourning Cat rather than tell Margaery she'll go after Stannis.
Â 
With this said, since the books are not finished maybe the show is reminding us of the Stannis thing because Brienne WILL eventually go after him, we don't know. Still, I think a Sansa/Brienne scene was needed.

Well, I think you have to "fast forward" Jaime's character development, they can't devote hours to the Jaime Riverlands tour.Â  Returning before Joff and Tywin are dead lets D+D show us more about who he is (now) without introducing new characters/sets/relationships.

If I'm Tywin, knowing full well Brienne was tasked with stealing my hostage, for whom I still have plans, I'm keeping Brienne and Sansa apart.Â  Even though Brienna can't do anything smart, she could still do something foolish.
Â 
And Brienne had her sights set on Stannis first anyway.
Â 
I'm also not sure where a Brienna/Sansa scene GOES.Â  "Sorry I couldn't get here in time to trade you back to your mother so you could have been killed by the Freys"Â  "Yeah, they wouldn't have traded me for anything, Lannisters lie, didn't you notice." "Oh, well, Jaime's not so bad." "Whatever, my family is destroyed."
2405	GHOSTSTARK	2014-04-18	A great scene. Brienne was very sweet and not at all sure of her own feelings, and it's these very insecurities that Cersei thrives on. I don't see what's "unsubtle" or "wrong" with this.


 Â Â
2406	Le Cygne	2014-04-18	Like Brienne says on the show, she's not safe there. And Jaime knows she's right. Jaime didn't consult with any of the other Lannisters when he devised the plan to take Sansa somewhere safe. He went behind their backs. Keeping his oath is not leaving her with the Lannisters. What can Brienne do, she can try to help her. She would have done that if there wasn't this artificial constraint that she wasn't supposed to be there yet.What did Sansa want? To get the hell out of there.

Â 
The way I figure it they only would have had to add one more plot element for them at the beginning of S3 and thenÂ have them sit out an episode somewhere in the middle, and it would have bumped their wholeÂ story back two episodes. If he returned after the PW, as he does in the books, he could still interact with Cersei, Tywin, Tyrion, andÂ Loras.
2408	Le Cygne	2014-04-18	Yeah, they had things they could do, the road back, they could have achieved as much or more for the characters, given the setbacks of some of the backtracking/I'm not really here scenes.Several scenes. Give Jaime and Brienne some closure with the bearpit scene, which they missed when they took away the closing moments from the book scene and replaced them with a pissing contest between Jaime and Locke. A Jaime/Brienne scene doing that, where they acknowledged what he just did, would have been much better than the Brienne/Cersei scene, where she acknowledged what he did. They could have had the book scenes where they found out about the Red Wedding. Jaime tried to console Brienne, who was mourning for Catelyn, and at a loss, since she wasn't able to save her daughters. The added drama of the sept scene with Cersei, the buildup, here I am, here you are, and for both, that immediate awareness that things were changed, and they would never be the same again. The added drama of Tywin telling him to marry Margaery, and Jaime saying no. No standing by while Sansa is implicated in a regicide plot, and Joffrey is killed right before the Lord Commander's eyes. And so on...So they return in episode 3, that's where anything of substance begins for them anyway, apart from the scene with Tywin, which they could show then.

Personally I hope that it won't be Jaime who kills Cercei. I don't want him to have her blood on his hands. It would be too much of a burden for the rest of his life.


Â 
I dont think Jaime will outlive Cersei for too long.Â 
Â 


I think it is a fabulous scene. Christie played Brienne's reaction brilliantly - she is not sure of her feeling for Jaimie and has to sort that one out. But Cersei asks Brienne if she loves him the way a jealous lover would - not a sister. Brienne begins to realize that maybe the rumors about Cersei and Jamie are true.....(I love Loras' comment to Jamie as well).
Â 
Cersei is fascinated by this woman and her ties to Jamie....and Brienne is the exact opposite of Cersei in every way.
Â 
It is my opinion that Jamie is the Valinquor (spelling?) and he will be the one to kill Cersei, and it will be because of Brienne. That is just my opinon.


Â 
I highly doubt that Jaime will kill Cersei because of Brienne. It will probably because of her burning down King's Landing or something. somehow I doubt that Jaime will be successful in saving King's Landing the second time around though. that's just too lucky. he'll either die in the flames with Cersei or Cersei will also find someway to kill him. I don't see Jaime getting a happy or peaceful ending.

2410	jaimecersei	2014-04-18	Yeah, they had things they could do, the road back, they could have achieved as much or more for the characters, given the setbacks of some of the backtracking/I'm not really here scenes.
Several scenes. Give Jaime and Brienne some closure with the bearpit scene, which they missed when they took away the closing moments from the book scene and replaced them with a pissing contest between Jaime and Locke. A Jaime/Brienne scene doing that, where they acknowledged what he just did, would have been much better than the Brienne/Cersei scene, where she acknowledged what he did. They could have had the book scenes where they found out about the Red Wedding and the Purple Wedding. Jaime tried to console Brienne, who was mourning for Catelyn, and at a loss, since she wasn't able to save her daughters. The added drama of the sept scene with Cersei, the buildup, here I am, here you are, and for both, that immediate awareness that things were changed, and they would never be the same again. The added drama of Tywin telling him to marry Margaery, and Jaime saying no. No standing by while Sansa is implicated in a regicide plot, and Joffrey is killed right before the Lord Commander's eyes. And so on...


Â 
yeah the book timeline is so much more interesting and compelling. In my opinion, they should have ended Season 3 with Brienne mourning over the RW. Had episode 1 of Season 4 be the PW (really start the season with a bang). and Jaime returns to Kings Landing in episode 2

That would've been awesome.
2412	'96Buck	2014-04-18	Â 
The way I figure it they only would have had to add one more plot element for them at the beginning of S3 and thenÂ have them sit out an episode somewhere in the middle, and it would have bumped their wholeÂ story back two episodes. If he returned after the PW, as he does in the books, he could still interact with Cersei, Tywin, Tyrion, andÂ Loras.


Yes, and he still will...but now you have the chance to do it before 2 completely distinct backdrops.

2414	Will&Chrismom	2014-04-18	I have often thought that book readers like us tend to over think things when it comes to adaptations of books-to-screen. TV is not the same medium as a novel; what works beautifully on the page often doesn't work at all on screen.
Â 
To wit, I must admit bafflement at the idea that Brienne's pain over Lady Catelyn deserves any time at all. TV!Brienne is very different from the book character--she is older, less girlish, a bit tougher and harder. Her investment in Cat was not as emotionally tied as it was in the books. Brienne is a romantic at heart but on the show she doesn't get to serve as confidant to Cat in the way she did in the books. So to lose Cat, for Brienne, might be hard on the TV show, but not the kind of devastation it might be in the books.
Â 
Moreover, because of this, I'm confused by this notion that Brienne even deserves screen time to express any agony over the loss of Lady Catelyn at all, particularly when people more important to Cat--her daughters--have to face her violent murder and deal with processing that under the worst of circumstances. For Arya, it's being literally moments and feet away from her mother right before her death, and not being able to stop it. For Sansa, it's being stuck in King's Landing married into the very family that orchestrated the murders. Honestly, who cares what Brienne thinks? On this show, it should be all about the Stark kids (at least, those Stark kids who know their mother has been killed).
Â 
It is entirely possible that we will see Brienne express sadness over the death of Cat in a future episode, probably when she is given the task of finding Sansa. But up to now Brienne has not been given the kind of time and latitude to get very emotional, b/c on the show she tends to try and hide her feelings as much as possible, and ultimately, she's just not as big a player as Sansa or Arya, anyway. She's a "Supporting Actor" in this story. Much as I love the character, I reconcile myself to the fact that she's a side dish, not the main course.
2415	Peter George Stewart	2014-04-18	I found Brienne's reaction to Cersei's 'do you love him' to be heavily unnecessary. It takes a lot of the mystery out of Brienne and Jaime's unspoken connection, and creates a previously non-existent romance to root for that was never overly suggested in the books at all. What I so liked about Jaime & Brienne's relationship was just how unconventional it was and how little it revolved around ideas like love and sex. It seemed to be based more around shared experience, admiration and trust. I was disappointed that they felt the need to throw a 'Hollywood' kind of romance into this dynamic. Also, Brienne's reaction was completely unbelievable, she easily could have denied it.


Â 
Huh?Â  To me, Brienne's reaction was perfect - it was like Cersei had perceptively articulated something Brienne hadn't yet thought of in such clear terms herself, but as soon as it was articulated, that's the moment she realized it was true.

2416	Kungsmurfen	2014-04-19	I find much more disturbing that Sansa Stark is there and Brianne doesnt give a damn.



Â 
I didn't think about that when watching but you're right! I'd have prefered her to have a scene with Sansa rather than Cersei.

					
					
							Edited by Kungsmurfen, 19 April 2014 - 05:36 AM.
2417	Le Cygne	2014-04-19	I think they portrayed the closeness between Brienne and Catelyn on the show rather well, they had some great scenes together. I think it's necessary to show her feelings of loss there, for sure.
2418	SeventySeven	2014-04-19	Â

Â 


Â 
All well and good, but that's not what I mean. Brienne and Cat are to meet again, right? You want to set that up, because otherwise it loses some of the poignancy to it. It's for the same reason we need to know Brienne is in love with Jaime, because she's going to be asked to kill the man she's fallen for, which is different than being asked to kill a comrade (still bad, not quite as heartbreaking though). In the books that bit is really sad exactly because we know how Brienne feels for Jaime, what she went through to keep the promise she made to Cat which is something we won't see in the show because Brienne's journey will be shortened so she won't suffer as much, AND the fact she grieved for Catelyn. It all means a lot to Brienne.
Â 
I'm not debating that people more important to Cat shouldn't take precedence in this sort of screen time, but since Arya and Sansa are not to meet UnCat anytime soon contrary to Brienne, and since they're making up scenes anyway, at least add some canon-compliant stuff. Again, for instance swapping the Brienne/Marge scene for a scene with Sansa.
2419	Le Cygne	2014-04-19	Another interview, this time with Alex Graves, the director:
Â 

And the scene with Jaime and Brienne in the bathtub is like you're shooting a film with a lesbian and a knight, she's a knight, he's a knight, they're in love and don't know they're in love; where else would you get to film a scene like that?

Â 
And this is really interesting, not just this story, but all the stories:
Â 
A lot of that comes down to sitting down with Dave and Dan and saying, "What happens in season 6? Because I don't know what I'm doing." And they'll tell you what you're doing. I've had many moments with the actors where I've taken them aside and told them, "This is what happens next season" or even at the end of the whole series. And they'll go, "Oh, thank God you told me that. Now I know how to play it."

2420	HairGrowsBack	2014-04-20	Yeah, I'm so glad he acknowledges that ; although, what's up with the lesbian thing ? Was he drunk or something ? 
Anyway, I think the way things are playing in the show, and taking the books into account, there's 90% chance of it going to a concrete somewhere.
2421	Le Cygne	2014-04-20	I know, I didn't know how to take that, either. A very odd thing to throw in there. The crush on Renly was played up on the show pretty obviously.
					
					
							Edited by Le Cygne, 20 April 2014 - 02:31 AM.
2422	HairGrowsBack	2014-04-20	Also, it baffles me that, in 2014, there's still need to explain that 'masculine' woman =/= Lesbian.Â  There's zero instance of Brienne showing romantic/sexual interest in other women.
2423	Le Cygne	2014-04-20	Yeah, that bothered me, too. That just came out of left field for a number of reasons. She is who she is. She's a knight (for all intents and purposes, I don't think she's actually been admitted to the boy's club).
2424	SlowLoras	2014-04-20	Also, it baffles me that, in 2014, there's still need to explain that 'masculine' woman =/= Lesbian.Â  There's zero instance of Brienne showing romantic/sexual interest in other women.


Â 
Unfortunately, I think that's where their 'lesbian' assumption came from. She's only ever outwardly expressed romantic/sexual feelings for men - she just happens to look and behave in a traditionally 'masculine' manner.

Â 
This. But it's weird to see a director talk about a masculine looking girl as a "lesbian". Honestly, I'm not giving any weight to that quote exactly because he uses that word incorrectly. Brienne is not a lesbian.Â

Â 
It's pretty unfortunate. It harks back to the whole 'bull dyke' thing and it's just plain wrong, as you say. It's sort of ironic actually because were lesbianism a recognised 'thing' among the nobles in asoaif, I don't doubt they'd probably suggest it of Brienne too.
2427	WiDMNDBAMMD	2014-04-20	Cersei's lashing out at everyone this episode. Ellaria, Pycelle, Brienne...
Â 
It's important to keep that in mind.
Â 
Cersei never gives people the "easy questions" if she doesn't then she's just completely ignoring the person and trying to get them to STFU and go away.Â 
Â 
It's completely logical question for Cersei to ask, and Brienne's silence is a completely logical response. Brienne knows about Jaime and Cersei's "relationship" she heard Jaime confess it to Catelyn.
Â 
Another Westeros Love Triangle, great. Actually it's more like an octagon
2428	Black Wolf Smith	2014-04-20	To the OP, I think if you have Brienne at the Wedding, that scene had to take place. There have been quite a few scenes that been added, just so things said out right, instead of the long, subtle hints that the books gives you. There is no way they could give enough time, for viewers the same amount time to see how JL/BoT to build that up, like the book.Â
2429	Hoo	2014-04-21	I found Cersei's question out of the blue and that shocked me. Â Not once did I think Jamie and Briene had a romantic connection, not even in the pool. Â And now this? Â Especially considering Cersei's attempts to distance herself from Jamie. Â It just was out of place.

No offense taken. Â I did not read the books. Â I am just watching the show, and the questioning did not fit the plot up to that point.
2432	HairGrowsBack	2014-04-21	No offense taken. Â I did not read the books. Â I am just watching the show, and the questioning did not fit the plot up to that point.


Oh, my bad then. I get where you're coming from, they've pretty much fast-forward this aspect of the story.
2433	Mad Monkey	2014-04-27	Honestly, I didn't pick up on the Brienne/Jaime thing until the fourth book anyway, when we got Brienne's perspective and realized that she thinks about Jaime in the same way that she thinks of Renly (and she occasionally combines them into one person). I agree with Hoo, it almost feels like Cersei had read those chapters from AFFC and was grilling Brienne about them, which seems like another unfair advantage that the Lannisters have over everyone else.
2434	WhatIsDeadMayNeverLive	2014-04-14	In season 3, the dialogue was so sharp it could cut through glass, especially in the big episodes (9 and 4). Season 4 is just not on the same level so far. The purple wedding was not nearly as intense as it was supposed to be. Just compare it to the mutiny at Craster's, you could literary feel the tension in that scene. When you consider that S4E2 had far better source material than S3E4, you have to ask yourself if the show lost some of it's magic.
Â 
Thoughts? Am I the only one who feels this way?
2435	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-04-14	I thought the dialogue in 401 was excellent. It was pretty good this past episode too. We have a tendency to think that what has passed, is better. But I think the first 2 episodes of season 4 have lived up to GoT standards.
2436	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-15	I feel the dialogue this season has gotten a tad more bitchy, with more burns, zings and one-liners. This episode I felt some of the convos a bit direct and lacking subtlety and veiled threats (namely Cersei and Brienne, and Oberyn/Ellaria vs the Lannisters), but other than that I don't feel anything jarring about it.
2437	Queen of Whores	2014-04-15	Yep, season 4 has definitely lost some subtlety and wit and power when it comes to dialogue. I thought I was the only one that noticed it. I really liked Jon's trial and Sandor in the inn though in the first episode. The dialogue was quite good there. Not season 1 level, of course, but better than the rest of season 4.
2438	Luciferase_3H	2014-04-15	I thought Kit Harington in his one little scene did much better than in previous seasons. I take my own criticism of the show and its dialogue with buckets of salt because of my tendency to compare it across mediums and finding the show to be much inferior. Of course a lot of the subtlety from book to show is going to be lost but sometimes I do fill in a lot of the gaps in the show with what I know from the books. Makes it seem much richer that way even though in reality it might not be to someone who hasn't read them.Â 
Â 
I don't fucking know haha
2439	IlAovatar	2014-04-15	I thought there was something lacking when Joffrey and Tyrion interacted during the wedding. For some reason it just didn't feel as tense as their previous spats, which is disappointing considering this is the point where they're really supposed to push each other.
Â 
I'm not sure whether it was something wrong with the actors' performances, the writing/directing, or simply a case of viewers seeing the two clash so many times that it's lost its impact.
2440	Onna Lewyys	2014-04-15	I certainly think that most of Oberyn's lines could cut through glass. I'm still marveling over all the layers of his dialogue with Tywin & Cersei at the PW.
2441	PhoenixFlame	2014-04-15	Everyone's gotten smacked by the Sass Fairy. For me, the threats and jabs that come across less veiled reflect the tension of the characters. It should be a moment of Lannister triumph but Cersei's a dethroned broodmare, Loras is engaged to Cersei, Jaime's crippled and realizes how much the city's changed without him...the gloves are off and the punches are aimed at the windpipes. Then you have Oberyn who LOLs at subtlety because that's his brother's gig and he'd rather start a barfight.Â

Â 
Maybe it was the lack of drunk Tyrion? I was happy with the scenes overall, but maybe Dinklage was playing it a little more mopey and despondent as opposed to really bumping heads with Joff.
Â 
Personally I think the dialogue so far this season has been really impressive.
2443	David Selig	2014-04-15	It never had it. The dialogue has always been the weakest part of the show by far.
2444	protar	2014-04-15	I'd have to agree with Selig that there has always been a fair share of cringy dialogue in the show. As usual it's of higher quality when they stick to the books. Of course D+D manage to give us a few gems, a lot from Bronn and the story carries the show regardless. But yeah the dialogue has never been stellar.
2445	boojam	2014-04-15	I thought most of Dave and Dan's dialog was good in episode 1 this season.That is only episode 1.Now episode 1 had the Arya and Hound tavern fight and dialog and that matched the best I have seen across four seasons.Sandor's increasing irritation with Polliver was just a gem.The 'chicken' thing became a sensation on the net and elsewhere.Composition and dialog for that sequence was just perfect.Well George did write episode 2, except for Tyrion's chiding Joffrey , which was spot on (is that from the book?), the wedding had pretty flat dialog. Well the whole sequence was mainly visual.Other short pieces of dialog were good too.(People complain about Kit and Emilia, but with a few exceptions, Sibel Kekilli is a wooden Indian, turning what might be good dialog into flat beer, maybe it is her problem with English?)I don't know if Dave and Dan fiddled with it or George just zipped thru it, or Alex Graves just was too busy with the complexity of the shooting of the wedding to ask for better dialog?One thing I don't know about the episode directors ,I recognize their names and know some of their work, they all seem very competent , but I don't know if any of them are 'actors directors' too? I mean we do have evidence that multiple takes are shot, and it's not true of a lot of feature film directors, but there are movie directors who will tweak, suggest, cajole, so on actors about delivery and projection.Some actors don't need this ... I think of Dance and Rigg on the show, Peter and other veteran actors too....But as has been noted, Kit and Emilia seem to be just giving just a competent reading of the script at times.Kit seems to be a John Wayne type, Kit playing Kit, but that's ok with me I liked John Wayne.Emilia drives me a little crazy, she nailed Dracarys!, S3E4, but has seemed off her mark this season, as she has been before, except season 1.Everybody seems to have a tough time , with exceptions, writing dialog for the 'Across the Narrow Sea' sequences.But then Benioff & Weiss wrote "And Now His Watch Is Ended" and "The Rains of Castamere" (the RW excited them) , when there are scenes that get their juices going they are sharp with the dialog.By the by, Carice van Houten finally nailed "The Night is ....." this episode, I always remember Season 2 when she gave it an almost falling inflection which went down with a thud. I don't know if that was Alan Taylor's fault or hers. But she sure hit the mark this time and Taylor was directing again. Seems van Houten has gotten more enthusiastic about the role than she was in season 2.

2446	Daske	2014-04-15	Not for me. The dialogue (and interactions generally)Â is one of the things that critics point to in the show that is a strong point. The first two episodes have been great. And it's probably one of the most quotable shows ever made - the threads here for memorable quotes on each episode are long and varied.
2447	Queen of Whores	2014-04-15	The dialogue is passable most of the time, and merely 'good' at best. It's pales in comparison to the dialogue of such shows like Deadwood and The Wire, with equally funny and poetic dialogue being said just about all the time.
2448	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-04-15	I think the dialogue is fine.
I admit I did think Tyrion talking to Joffrey at the wedding, when he declined the opportunity to fight the Dwarves, was a bit flat.
I really think people massively over react to the show and whinge endlessly on and on and on about things that just arenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t there.
I honestly think the show is getting better when it isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t just scene for scene from the book, although I do love the scene for scene sections.
For example, I really like Jaimie and Tyrion talking to each other in 02. Completely made up for the show, but it captures the feeling of the two characters. Jaimie knocking over the cup was a nice touch.
But yeah, whinging its not the book is basically the biggest criticism I see, apart from Show Stannis being wrong, which I agree with but donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t really cry about it really.

I need an Al Swearengen fix... The semi-invented English he uses is as good as anything ever. I'd say only Firefly comes close.

I definitely did not get that impression. PW had an amazing dialogue, Cersei was on fire and the whole Ellaria introduction scene was golden.
2451	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-04-15	Not really, the show has always had great or poor dialogue for book viewers. I thought overall 401 was great, 402 was pretty good as well. If anything I think it's an upgrade from the dialogue in the first two episodes of Season 3. Even the way Tyrion tries to rid himself of Shae was refreshing compared to how their conversations usually go.Â
2452	Chebyshov	2014-04-15	Â

Agreed. Interesting people are disliking it, especially given GRRM wrote the PW episode.
2453	TheHouseHB	2014-04-15	How could you not like the conversation with Roose, Ramsay and Theon? Also, with Oberyn, Tywin and Cersei?
2454	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-15	Â Also, with Oberyn, Tywin and Cersei?


Â 
Â 
The one issue I have with that is that Oberyn was focusing his invective at Lady Cersei and almost appeared cordial to Lord Tywin until then the end. It really seemed like a scene that had a lot more written for it originally and had to be pared back by a significant amount.

Â 
That's the point, he was appearing to be cordial and then drops a bomb, like hey by the way I'm coming for you too. I don't see why him picking on Cersei is out of the ordinary, especially when he knows this day is especially hard for Cersei since she's no longer really a queen and her son is being married off. He's just rubbing salt in the wounds.

Â 
I have no problem with that, it was just that he was apparently cordial to Tywin until the bomb was dropped, yet aggressive to Cersei from the start. Cersei's fault was snubbing Ellaria. Admittedly Tywin didn't but there is the whole dead babies/raped sister thing. The 4 actors were great. The writing really just felt as though there were a few lines 'missing' somehow.
2457	Eddard the Builder	2014-04-15	Nah not really. Â The show has always had its heavy handed moments i.e. season 1.
"Fish, the sigil of House Tully..."
"Tully, isn't that your wife's house? Â My lord Hand?"
2458	Modesty Lannister	2014-04-15	I think episode 1 was great, apart from Daenerys bit, which was something taken out of some sitcom with the new and unimproved Dario. The second episode though wasn't that great. Bran bit was bad. Bad acting (Bran), lack of any action (they just sit around in freezing cold or sleep!!!). PW felt totally anti-climatic. I think it was badly directed and that actors got confused about what they were supposed to do. Peter Dinklage was very lame, especially while delivering the dwarf line. While Joffrey was dying, Charles Dance was everywhere. In one shot he was covering Tommen's eyes (nice touch btw), in the other he seemed to be looking over his twins' shoulders to see dying Joffrey better. No continuity. Shae departing scene was the worst. Both Dinklage and the German girl were totally confused in what they were supposed to do, the dialogue was lame, psychology dubious at best. Again no continuity when it comes to Tyrion's feelings about Shae leaving reflected at the PW. The wedding itself did not seem grand at all to me visually. Again, I think it was bad directing. Finally, I think dialogues are the worst when the producers change the original idea, but cannot replace it with anything better. They had a solution for the Bolton change and it worked (Roose coming to Dreadfort with a small host while MC is still in the hands of the Ironborn).

I have no problem with that, it was just that he was apparently cordial to Tywin until the bomb was dropped, yet aggressive to Cersei from the start. Cersei's fault was snubbing Ellaria. Admittedly Tywin didn't but there is the whole dead babies/raped sister thing. The 4 actors were great. The writing really just felt as though there were a few lines 'missing' somehow.


I see what you're saying. Unfortunately I've almost always felt that way about the show's dialogue, that there could be a couple more lines here and there but they condense it for the sake of saving time or whatever. It's especially obvious to us since in the books there are lots of relatively long conversations that have such great exchanges, the one that comes to mind being Oberyn and Tyrion's first conversation with the whole history between the Martells and Lannisters. But I suppose they thought it was just too long so reduced it to "Your father's pet killed my sister and children and now I've come to pay that debt."

2460	zeus	2014-04-15	Agree, i think there was something missing during this episode. In saying that i think most of the dialogue is just turning into sarcasm and bitchiness.Â 
Â 
Â
2461	MyLittleDirewolf	2014-04-15	Nah not really. Â The show has always had its heavy handed moments i.e. season 1.
"Fish, the sigil of House Tully..."
"Tully, isn't that your wife's house? Â My lord Hand?"


Yes, but they have to get this stuff in somehow. Other than having little thingys pop up like they do on Survivor, telling you the contestant's name and their age/occupation/team.
2462	Sigrunn	2014-04-15	I favour subtlety when it comes to threats among the nobles. I understand, however, why the dialogue between Lannisters and Martells held nothing like that. Their hatred has to be plain. Grasping these things is difficult for people who did not read the books.

2463	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-04-15	I thought most of Dave and Dan's dialog was good in episode 1 that season.
That is only episode 1.
Now episode 1 had the Arya and Hound tavern fight and dialog and that matched the best I have seen across four seasons.
Sandor's increasing irritation with Polliver was just a gem.
The 'chicken' thing became a sensation on the net and elsewhere.
Composition and dialog for that sequence was just perfect.
Well George did write episode 2, except for Tyrion's chiding Joffrey , which was spot on (is that from the book?), the wedding had pretty flat dialog. Well the whole sequence was mainly visual.
Other short pieces of dialog were good too.
(People complain about Kit and Emilia, but with a few exceptions, Sibel Kekilli is a wooden Indian, turning what might be good dialog into flat beer, maybe it is her problem with English?)
I don't know if Dave and Dan fiddled with it or George just zipped thru it, or Alex Graves just was too busy with the complexity of the shooting of the wedding to ask for better dialog?One thing I don't know about the episode directors ,I recognize their names and know some of their work, they all seem very competent , but I don't know if any of them are 'actors directors' too? I mean we do have evidence that multiple takes are shot, and it's not true of a lot of feature film directors, but there are movie directors who will tweak, suggest, cajole, so on actors about delivery and projection.
Some actors don't need this ... I think of Dance and Rigg on the show, Peter and other veteran actors too....
But as has been noted, Kit and Emilia seem to be just giving just a competent reading of the script at times.
Kit seems to be a John Wayne type, Kit playing Kit, but that's ok with me I liked John Wayne.
Emilia drives me a little crazy, she nailed Dracarys!, S3E4, but has seemed off her mark this season, as she has been before, except season 1.
Everybody seems to have a tough time , with exceptions, writing dialog for the 'Across the Narrow Sea' sequences.
But then Benioff & Weiss wrote "And Now His Watch Is Ended" and "The Rains of Castamere" (the RW excited them) , when there are scenes that get their juices going they are sharp with the dialog.
By the by, Carice van Houten finally nailed "The Night is ....." this episode, I always remember Season 2 when she gave it an almost falling inflection which went down with a thud. I don't know if that was Alan Taylor's fault or hers. But she sure hit the mark this time and Taylor was directing again. Seems van Houten has gotten more enthusiastic about the role than she was in season 2.


Â 
That's interesting. Â Episode 4.2 was directed by Alex Graves, who also directed 3.4 (mutiny at Craster's) and 3.5, and is the director for 4.3, 4.8, and 4.10. Â In GoT's stable of top-flight television directors, Graves and Tim Van Patten (1.1 and 1.2) would be considered by many to be the best of the bunch (excluding Neil Marshall who belongs in a category of his own).
Â 
But I'd have to agree with the general sentiment that the exchange between Tyrion and Joffrey was awkward and bad, and Cersei's 'zero to bitchy' moment after Joffrey's death may be the most laughable moment of the entire series (which is really saying something when you consider how truly God-awful Emilia Clarke is at her job).
2464	JoramunsKazoo	2014-04-15	I actually appreciated the scenes that dropped dialog.Â  To me, the actor's expressions really made this episode rich.Â  I felt extremely uncomfortable watching Joffery humiliate Tyrion, and watching all of Tyrion, Sansa, Tywin, and QoT's expressions to name a few.Â  I felt that 2nd hand embarrassment and disgust as if I were at the tables myself.
Â 
Stannis is a different story, but whatever.Â  Dragonstone was filler in this episode.

Â 
I'm still trying to figure out what the whole scene with Mel and Shireen was for, adorable as Shireen is, I just don't get why it was included.Â
2466	Legion of Doom	2014-04-15	I thought there was something lacking when Joffrey and Tyrion interacted during the wedding. For some reason it just didn't feel as tense as their previous spats, which is disappointing considering this is the point where they're really supposed to push each other.
Â 
I'm not sure whether it was something wrong with the actors' performances, the writing/directing, or simply a case of viewers seeing the two clash so many times that it's lost its impact.


Â 
I can kind of see what you mean, but that may have been because we knew what was coming-unless you didn't, in which case not sure what was up. But knowing how that fight was going to end obviously altered the dynamic a bit for me. I think the writing is sharp as ever and episode two was written by GRRM.
2467	Daenerys Must Die	2014-04-15	I'm just waiting for Cogman's episodes .. I think his last was Kissed by Fire last season which was a gem .. and he's been given more episodes (2 or 3?) since they've cut the other writers who were underwhelming for me.
Â 
So far 4x01 was very good - was able to rely a bit on comic relief which is always helpful but still requires good writing to be effective.
4x02 a bit disappointing but at the same time it was a big ask for all of these central characters to connect with each other at the wedding .. Roose/Ramsay/Theon was well written as were bits in between and ultimately thought Alex Graves directed a very tough wedding sequence well.

2468	Queen of Whores	2014-04-15	My biggest problem is how flat everything felt. It didn't feel like it was building up to any thing, or that the atmosphere was getting more intense. In the book it felt this way, but not on the show. Normally the show is very good at building tension and atmosphere, like Ned's coup in the throne room in 1x7 (one of my favourite scenes in the show), and the mutiny at Craster's, but here it just... fizzled out. I dunno. I was underwhelmed. Hopefully this failure was a one-off and the show goes back up to better quality.
2469	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-04-15	I thought the prolonged silences and awkwardness between Tyrion and Joffrey were very tense, coupled with all the disgruntled leers from half the wedding party. My roommate who's Unsullied was on the edge of his seat because you could tell something drastic was going to happen.
2470	raj34	2014-04-15	I thought there was something lacking when Joffrey and Tyrion interacted during the wedding. For some reason it just didn't feel as tense as their previous spats, which is disappointing considering this is the point where they're really supposed to push each other.

Â 
I sort of agree here. I thought Tyrion was a little too restrained in his delivery when he was mocking Joffrey. As if he was reading a speech someone else had written from some hidden westerosi teleprompter.Â 
Â 
Probably the first time I've felt Dinklage didn't bring his A game.
2471	snowy	2014-04-15	No. It has its bright and dim moments like every season. I enjoy experiencing other artist visions of the story, even when they don't align with the books, sometimes especially when they don't adhere to them. Plus, we have only just started S04.
2472	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-15	I said in another thread that there was arguably too much consecutive snark, with the Brienne/Cersei, Jaime/Loras and Oberyn/Lannister conversations. It wasn't that there was anything wrong with the dialogue; more that it was too much of the same following on right one after the other. I tend to find that the dialogue's at it's strongest when they're doing the KL political stuff with characters like Tyrion/Tywin/Varys etc. It's the stuff that's generally done best in the show.
2473	Fool of a Book	2014-04-15	I find the writing spotty. Â Too much dialogue just to give face time to the actors (Brienne, Jaime, Dany, Jorah) and not enough for those characters I care most about (Sam, Sansa, Arya). Â Neither did much to further the story.
Â 
The great scenes were great. Â Freaking great. Â The off-book filler was tedious.
2474	Raksha 2014	2014-04-15	Â 
I'm still trying to figure out what the whole scene with Mel and Shireen was for, adorable as Shireen is, I just don't get why it was included.Â 


Â 
Â 
Maybe a budgetary reason to justify hiring the young actress who plays Shireen? Â I'm fine with it, because the girl is doing a fine job; she is really bringing Shireen to life for me. Â It was particularly poignant to see this lonely little girl sleeping in what looks like a dungeon (Dragonstone decor is particularly spartan) being addressed as "Princess" by the priestess who just burned her uncle (and others). Â Â 
Â 
Count me in with those who found the Joffrey/Tyrion interaction at the wedding quite tense and riveting. Â  The two actors had fine support from Sophie Turner as Sansa as well as assorted Lannisters and Tyrells and others who reacted in different ways (mostly with disgust at Joffrey's nastiness, except for Cersei, who was delighted and smug at the sight of her boy humiliating Tyrion).

I have no problem with it either. I was perhaps opening discussion on whether that scene will become important, or at least relevant, since I can't really think of why the discussion was filmed. I'm not one of those people that thinks Mel will suggest burning Shireen, but perhaps Shireen plays an important role if perhaps only to be a window into Melissandre's history.
2476	Miss Carnahan	2014-04-15	Have to agree that the dialogue has never really been the show's strongest point (it lacks subtlety), but the non-verbal reactions were really good this episode (much better than all the dialogue combined). Especially Turner's reaction to the dwarves' performance.
2477	Mark Antony	2014-04-15	No different from the last two seasons IMO

Â 
I'd rather have Shireen/Melisandre dialogue than more of Selyse, especially Selyse and her dead babies in jars. Â I wonder if they're trying to suggest that Melisandre is basically a kinder person than Selyse, despite Mel's fondness for burning people alive? Â Or at least a more sane person than Selyse? Â Hard to tell. Â I'm not a huge fan of the show's incarnation of the Dragonstone group, except for Davos and Shireen.
2479	Queen of Whores	2014-04-15	I hope that as soon as the focus isn't as closed in like 4x2 then the dialogue and writing in general will get a bit better. I'm gonna toss it up to a one-off what happened.

2480	Konradsmith	2014-04-15	I don't really see how they've made her any more shrill than her book counterpart. In many ways she's more realistic, like for instance, not having a mustache which would have made her into more of a caricature than the pickled fetuses would. The point is that Stan has an odd family dynamic and if Selyse disliking Shireen can make Shireen into Stan's "morality pet" (a tvtropes.com term) then it's fine by me.

Â 
I think having read the books may spoil some on what a treat the writing can be in the show. There's often a preconceived notion of how a scene should be played out or acted in context with the novels.Â 
Â 
There's a reason why critics and Unsullied praise the show as they do. What good is a complex character without well-written dialogue? I'm not saying it's always the case - they do stumble every now and then. But every show does, even the great ones. There's plenty of moments in Deadwood where dialogue falls flat because even Milch seems to try too hard in coming across as rough and poetic (never the case with Al though, I'll give him that!). The Wire is another example; although I think that can attributed to a lot of the "improv" that goes into making it feel authentic.Â It's just the way it goes. GoT does a fine job of getting across the essential points and conflict, without bogging down too much in exposition, and consolidating for those introverted characters. Again, they're not always perfect, but I still think they do a commendable job for the most part.
Â 
I thought they built the tension wonderfully during the wedding, and that seems pretty evident from all the Unsullied reactions of fearing a bomb would drop (not in their favour). Even though I knew what was coming, I was still on the edge of my seat just like the tavern scene last episode.
Â 
That's just my opinion as a person who watches GoT objectively, anyway.Â
2482	Phaing	2014-04-15	No different from the last two seasons IMO


.... now that you mention it.
Â 
Yeah, not a good thing, either, what with all the filler we've had to put up with.
2483	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-15	Shireen/Mel scene wasÂ awesome because it really shows that Shireen is her own person and more like her daddy than she realizes. I loved it. I also loved it cuz the Great Other got a mention at long last.Â 

Â 
Thoughts? Am I the only one who feels this way?

Heh probably. Two episodes in and we have the Hound's Chicken Extravaganza, Oberyn's everything, Loras' epic ice burn, Snarky Jon, and "I fucking hate Thenns."Â 
If anything, its getting better.Â

I remained unsullied until midway through Season 3, and part of the reason I gave in and read the books is because I felt the dialogue had diminished pretty substantially from Season 1 and didn't show any signs of improving (also because I fell victim to the spoilers of some massive, massive dick).

I slightly disagree. When I was watching the RW last year (and I don't even like Cat while being totally indifferent towards Robb) as a sullied book reader, I ended up standing with my hands over my mouth, saying "no, no, no". With PW I was totally unmoved. It dragged on and on. It didn't look like a royal wedding. And when it all happened, it was a total anti-climax for me. I mostly blame the director and Peter Dinklage whom I really admire, but he was totally off in this episode. Jaime's presence at Joffrey's side was totally unused. So, why was he there then? He is his father. His son is dying. We have to feel what he feels. If he feels nothing, we have to see it. As I have already said, Tywin was at three places at once - covering Tommen's eyes, looking over Cersei to see dying Joffrey and standing in front of the dais. It a huge directorial faux pas.Â
2493	Daske	2014-04-16	It's probably impossible to watch the Joffrey-Tyrion back-and-forth in the same light if you know how the scene is roughly going to play out. If you are completely unspoiled you have to be worried that Joffrey is going to end up killing him by the end of the scene (we know he wants to, and we know no character is safe), and I'm pretty sure that everyÂ jibe and retortÂ back and forth between the two is going to be seen as notching up the tension towards that very possible outcome. But if you know that's not going to happen in advanceÂ it will inevitably take something away from the scene, surely? (and there's nothing anyone can do about that).

I don't think people should feel they have to think a certain way just because some of the actors on the show do, regardless of how talented they are. The showÂ doesÂ have a lot of good dialogue, both from the books and a few snappy gems that D+D manage to come up. But it can be very patchy at times and sometimes comes out rather awkward and stilted.
2495	David Selig	2014-04-16	What are the members of the cast supposed to say? "The dialogue sucks, but they pay me a lot, so I don't mind." Come on.

(or does she say 'pie')....her delivery is funny , even if it's meant to defuse things.
2497	FNF	2014-04-16	It never had it. The dialogue has always been the weakest part of the show by far.


I agree to an extent, mostly because some of Ser Jorah Friendzone's lines have been fucking awful.

Â 
I just rewatched the scene with your point in mind - and it's simply not true. When Jofrrey falls to the ground and starts vomiting, Tywin goes to Tommen to cover his eyes. We see him again 7-8 seconds later heading toward Joffrey and Cersei. He remains there, near Joffrey's feet, for the remainder of the scene.Â 
Â 
I suggest you have another look.

2499	Belisarius09	2014-04-16	I thought Kit Harington in his one little scene did much better than in previous seasons. I take my own criticism of the show and its dialogue with buckets of salt because of my tendency to compare it across mediums and finding the show to be much inferior. Of course a lot of the subtlety from book to show is going to be lost but sometimes I do fill in a lot of the gaps in the show with what I know from the books.

2504	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-04-16	Ok whoa...some jerk spoiled

	Spoiler 
TYWIN AND SHAE?

for you? I would kick him right in the berries. I have unsullied fans all around me giving me theories about whats gonna happen now and i wouldnt dare spoilÂ thatÂ for them. I havent hinted at it.Â 


Â 
If he'd been in front of me, and not some anonymous internet DB, I very well may have. Â My problem is that I read very fast but my mind is rather slow, so by the time I realized I shouldn't be reading it I was already done (not unlike Jaime Lannister at the Whispering Wood).
Â 

	Spoiler I suppose the good thing was that the RW was easier to digest knowing the PW was coming. And knowing about Tywin kind of stunk, but I didn't know all the details and the way in which everything goes down with Tyrion still made that whole sequence an enjoyable read.

Â 


I slightly disagree. When I was watching the RW last year (and I don't even like Cat while being totally indifferent towards Robb) as a sullied book reader, I ended up standing with my hands over my mouth, saying "no, no, no". With PW I was totally unmoved. It dragged on and on. It didn't look like a royal wedding. And when it all happened, it was a total anti-climax for me.


Â 
I think this is what it boils down to. Â The analysis and debate is fun, but at the end of the day many of us simply had no emotional response as a result of watching the PW.
Â 
Throughout much of Season 3 I was underwhelmed with the majority of each episode but the 'WTF moments' at the end were still impactful. Â I knew what was coming with Jaime's hand and I still squeezed the remote so hard the battery cover popped off. Â The entire RW was absolutely gripping, and the end had me clutching my own chest and covering my neck with my shirt. Â 
Â 
I really enjoyed watching Joffrey as he died (which is very, very strange for me - I'm really uncomfortable with even fictional violence and death), but the whole thing just felt very anti-climactic (sorry for stealing your word, Lannister, but it's perfect).

2505	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-04-16	Comparing the emotional impact of the RW to that of the PW is illogical. When I read the RW I honestly got so pissed off the next few chapters I read nothing was absorbed. I wanted to rip apart the book. When I read the PW I was pleased, not awestruck and certainly not even remotely close to as emotionally impacted. It's unfair to compare them and try to draw any meaningful analysis of the quality of directing/acting/storytelling/writing.Â

Comparing the emotions that you felt afterward is illogical, I agree. Â Comparing the level of emotional buildup during each event, or comparing whether there was even any emotional impact at all, is anything but illogical, IMO.
Â 
edit: If you were honestly indifferent to the PW in the books, then yes, the comparison is pointless.

Â 
The emotional buildup during the RW and the PW aren't comparable at all. I can't speak to watching them without having read first, but one of them leads to the betrayals and deaths of 2 relatively beloved main characters, several beloved minor characters, a massacre of hundreds of unarmed men, and an end to what was popularly viewed to be the "Just" cause. The other leads to a widely hated character being poisoned.Â 
Â 
The PW wasn't written as emotionally intense. I remember reading the RW and the whole time my heart was thumping because everything seemed wrong. GRRM couldn't even write the RW until the rest of the book was done because of its emotional impact.Â

From the stuff we know for sure, we still have:
Â 
Oberyn vs. Mountain
Tyrion vs. Tywin and Shae
Littlefinger vs. Lysa
Massive Castle Black battle
Â 
Also I would say that Joffrey dying is an episode 9 moment for sure, since it's a pretty huge detail, but whether you think it was episode 9 quality is a different discussion entirely. Also D&D didn't write Joffrey dying, GRRM did, so if you don't think that's as impactful as the BeNeding, Blackwater, or RW, then you're probably right because it really isn't.Â

2512	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-16	This whole thread is so odd, I guess it just corralled all the tin ears on this forum.
As noted at the beginning of the thread the majority of the TV critics of the show have praised it for the sharp dialog (and no I don't think they have tin ears!)
Charles Dance and Dianna Rigg , both veteran Shakespearian actors, took to their characters because of the writing, that means the dialog too... I am not going against the judgment of experienced actors.


Yeah i agree with you, mate. Im not gonna argue with Charles fucking Dance.

but the whole thing just felt very anti-climactic

To me, it was a wee bit like that in the book. Its because it sorta comes out of nowhere but its a zinger that gets you later on. When you start thinking about the who and the why, etc. Then it swings back to awesome. I think its supposed to be a little anti-climactic but get your brain buzzing when you think about it. The show captured this well. Unsullied are still talking about the details so i would say its successful.Â

To be honest, these nudity objections are just hilariously over the top. How much screentime is devoted to it? A few minutes a season? It's a convenient criticism that sounds cool and all, but misses the mark. Especially if one stops to consider the source material that is just as "raunchy", if not more.

Â 
The Books were raunchy but its not the same. Its mostly actual characters going at it, not random porn stars without any story.Â 
Â 
As far as time goes, you may be right (although the Roz scenes felt like they went forever). To me it feels like it derails the narrative. Its distracting in the middle of the show to just throw a couple of minutes of T and A into the mix and then get back to the story. When was the last time you saw a GOT interview where the sex was not mentioned? Either have a legit reason for it or don't do it at all. It is lazy and feels like its done for marketing more than anything else. Â If I wanted to see porn I would head for the internet. In a show where there are so many characters and story arcs, every minute counts. Why are you wasting it on pointless nudity? Dany and Ygritte have had scenes that were well done and fit well into the story, but there is a lot that is pointless.Â

It more averages out at like a couple of minutes per episode as there's a sex scene in almost every one. I think someone did the math and it came to about 15 minutes per season or something like that. Which initially doesn't seem like much until you consider that:
Â 
a.) that's over a quarter of an episode and:
b.) scenes are usually 2-3 minutes anyway and yet a lot can be packed in to the short amount of time. 5-8 extra scenes is quite a lot.

Â 
That's exactly what I'm talking about. It's much ado about nothing where a bunch of people get all huffed and puffed over several minutes of screentime. Don't get me wrong - it's perfectly legitimate not to like this stuff, but the way everyone talks about gratuitous nudity all the time, you'd think each episode has half an hour of non-stop hardcore porn. It's an easy position to fall back on: whenever someone doesn't like something, hey, it's that gratuitous show with T&A. It's disingenuous.
Â 

Either have a legit reason for it or don't do it at all.

Â 
Thing is a large portion of nude scenes were serving plot and characters. Jon & Ygritte, as you mentioned, but many others as well. The only truly "gratuitous" (I hate that word) additions were Littlefinger brothel scenes in S1 (ease into it...), S2 (that over the top stuff with multiple peeping) and S3 (Pod's three whores). There are some others you could say are neither here nor there (Mel's leeches, for example), but those still have independent narrative purpose and nudity is just a "bonus"  .
Â 
Anyway, to make such noise over some 15 or however many minutes spread over 30 episodes... it's silly. As I said, cheap shots given much more prominence then the actual situation warrants.

Not really an honest representation of events. How many of those minutes have actual narrative importance? For example, Ygritte and Jon, Dany standing up naked in front of Daario (a fantastic scene showcasing Dany's power and fearlessness), and others. How many more are there just as a side show (gratuitous or not; I'll leave that for individual viewers to decide for themselves) while the main point of the scene is still there, taking up minutes all the same - e.g. Renly/Margaery/Loras, Viserys/Doreah, and many others.Â 
Â 
I'd even say that Theon scenes that seem unnecessary - with Ros, the captain's daughter - actually serve a particular purpose, namely to show that Theon reeeealy loves to have sex, which is a very important part of his later... ahem... developments.

It's not fair nor is it helpful to simply throw all the scenes in one big unrecognisable pile and say - yup, XYZ minutes of porn.

No that's not fair, but I was simply quickly generalising. Obviously a more in-depth analysis would require going through each of the sex scenes and determining which are useful and which aren't. Of course I'd still say that most of the sex is of the fanservice variety rather than the plot furthering variety so the my margin of error of 3 scenes seems reasonable.Â

Â 
Quite possible. Which again brings us to the point I was trying to make. The scenes where nothing goes on besides nudity are few. Therefore, the argument that those eat up a substantial amount of time is not really relevant.
2536	Khal-a-bunga	2014-04-17	The Huffington Post actually compiled every scene that contained nudity and/or sexual content for the first three seasons, and the total amount of screen-time came out to approximately 16 minutes for the first two seasons, and approximately 9 minutes in the third season. So 25 minutesÂ total, that features any sexual content, out of approximately 25 hours (taking the opening and ending credits, as well as the actual episode lengths into account). And, contrary to 'popular' belief, a lot of that material is focused on elements directly relating to the story line or the characters, while others are simple 'sexposition'.Â 
Â 
I'm no prude, so it never bothered me much in the first place, but there are plenty of shows on cable that feature a similar amount of sexual content and/or nudity that don't get even half the flack thatÂ Game of ThronesÂ receives.Â

I do think the fact that it's an adaptation is part of the reason it gets so much flak. In an original IP you can't really blame the writers for putting in too much gratuitous nudity. If it's not someone's thing they can simply move on and it doesn't affect them. Omitting scenes from source material in exchange for sex scenes and then saying that there's no time for those original scenes is a lot more grating. As is changing the tone of the source material from something rather serious to something a lot cheaper. Now of course I know you'll say that it doesn't change the tone because there's loads of sex in the books, but well I think I've previously laid out why I disagree with that. There are sex scenes and there are sex scenes.
Â 
And of course Game of Thrones is a huge phenomenon. It's no surprise if it gets more flak than smaller shows for this sort of thing.
2538	Fevre River Warrior	2014-04-17	I don't think the dialog has lost anything at all. Bronn has the best lines but they are all great.

I do think the fact that it's an adaptation is part of the reason it gets so much flak. In an original IP you can't really blame the writers for putting in too much gratuitous nudity.
Â 
Possibly, but it seems doubtful. And, to be honest, the majority of the flak leveled against the show for this reason is from book-readers (though non-readers also mention it quite often), who would be in a similar situation (unfamiliar with the 'source material', if any) for these other shows. My best guess is that it's because it is a fantasy series, and genre fans aren't as accustomed to the amount sexual content found in the book or the show, by and large. People who aren't a fan of the genre are probably even more surprised.
Â 
If it's not someone's thing they can simply move on and it doesn't affect them. Omitting scenes from source material in exchange for sex scenes and then saying that there's no time for those original scenes is a lot more grating.
Â 
Examples? You seem to think there's a 1:1 correlation between scenes with nudity and scenes from the book that were omitted for "sex scenes". It's about a lot more than that. You don't just get to exchange Littlefinger's monologue in the brothel for the battle at the Whispering Wood, for example. You're being reductive here. What are some examples of "sex scenes" you would cut, what would you replace them with (ideally something that could replace it from that same episode), and where/how would you convey the information lost in the scene that you cut, as a result?Â 
Â 
As is changing the tone of the source material from something rather serious to something a lot cheaper. Now of course I know you'll say that it doesn't change the tone because there's loads of sex in the books, but well I think I've previously laid out why I disagree with that. There are sex scenes and there are sex scenes.
Â 
I don't feel like the tone of the source material has been lost at all. The show is less rich, less powerful, less compelling, but these are all things that are 100% inevitable when adapting a series of novels as dense, complex, and long asÂ A Song of Ice & Fire. And really, you haven't "laid out" much of anything, since I'd argue that there are very few extraneous, titillation-only scenes featuring sexual content in the show.Â 
Â 
And of course Game of Thrones is a huge phenomenon. It's no surprise if it gets more flak than smaller shows for this sort of thing.

I'm no prude, so it never bothered me much in the first place, but there are plenty of shows on cable that feature a similar amount of sexual content and/or nudity that don't get even half the flack thatÂ Game of ThronesÂ receives.Â 


Exactly. I can only think of two really gratuitous moments. Littlefinger's brothel scene in season 1 and the Mel/Gendry one was really unnecessary (but ended up being a plot related scene despite that). So yeah. When i started watching the show, i was shocked about how mild the sex was in comparison to other stuff ive seen in premium serials.
2541	Grayven	2014-04-17	Everyone's gotten smacked by the Sass Fairy. For me, the threats and jabs that come across less veiled reflect the tension of the characters. It should be a moment of Lannister triumph but Cersei's a dethroned broodmare, Loras is engaged to Cersei, Jaime's crippled and realizes how much the city's changed without him...the gloves are off and the punches are aimed at the windpipes. Then you have Oberyn who LOLs at subtlety because that's his brother's gig and he'd rather start a barfight.Â 


Â 
I think they only missed one barb that I would have preferred instead of awkward silence..
Â 
Â 
Cersei: Â But you love him.
Â 
Brienne: Â Like a brother.

2543	Warhawk137	2014-04-17	I think it's about the same, I just think that the first couple episodes have been a bit thematically different, so the writing has a slightly different tone.Â  Particularly in south-central Westeros, where the nature of the threats to stability have changed quite a bit, there's a lot more pettiness and simmering nastiness, whereas in past seasons there was more outright present drama.Â  Where in the past there were more identifiable nexus of power, it's quite a bit more unsettled now.

2545	The Boar of Gore	2014-04-18	Brienne shouldn't even be in King's Landing because she has nothing to do there, and it forces her to confront a reality that was skillfully avoided in the book, namely, the fact that Jaime was screwing his own sister. Because, come on, anyone's gut reaction to that is going to be a queasy feeling followed by a swift disinvestment of emotion in their former love-interest. Basically, the show put her in that scene with Cersei so they could state for the camera "You love him" (which the audience knew anyway) and yet they've made it much less believable.
Â 
Scenes lose or gain power according to the truth in the emotions of the characters - something Gwendolyn Christie referred to in an interview, and something which helped her great performance in some powerful scenes of Season 3. Maybe the dialogue isn't as compelling as before because the writers have been losing sight of truth. A great line encapsulates the right reaction at the right dramatic moment, but how can a writer craft a great line if they lose sight of what the reaction should be, and how was Brienne supposed to react to Cersei?

I do think the fact that it's an adaptation is part of the reason it gets so much flak. In an original IP you can't really blame the writers for putting in too much gratuitous nudity.
Â 
Possibly, but it seems doubtful. And, to be honest, the majority of the flak leveled against the show for this reason is from book-readers (though non-readers also mention it quite often), who would be in a similar situation (unfamiliar with the 'source material', if any) for these other shows. My best guess is that it's because it is a fantasy series, and genre fans aren't as accustomed to the amount sexual content found in the book or the show, by and large. People who aren't a fan of the genre are probably even more surprised.
Â 
If it's not someone's thing they can simply move on and it doesn't affect them. Omitting scenes from source material in exchange for sex scenes and then saying that there's no time for those original scenes is a lot more grating.
Â 
Examples? You seem to think there's a 1:1 correlation between scenes with nudity and scenes from the book that were omitted for "sex scenes". It's about a lot more than that. You don't just get to exchange Littlefinger's monologue in the brothel for the battle at the Whispering Wood, for example. You're being reductive here. What are some examples of "sex scenes" you would cut, what would you replace them with (ideally something that could replace it from that same episode), and where/how would you convey the information lost in the scene that you cut, as a result?Â 
Â 
As is changing the tone of the source material from something rather serious to something a lot cheaper. Now of course I know you'll say that it doesn't change the tone because there's loads of sex in the books, but well I think I've previously laid out why I disagree with that. There are sex scenes and there are sex scenes.
Â 
I don't feel like the tone of the source material has been lost at all. The show is less rich, less powerful, less compelling, but these are all things that are 100% inevitable when adapting a series of novels as dense, complex, and long asÂ A Song of Ice & Fire. And really, you haven't "laid out" much of anything, since I'd argue that there are very few extraneous, titillation-only scenes featuring sexual content in the show.Â 
Â 
And of course Game of Thrones is a huge phenomenon. It's no surprise if it gets more flak than smaller shows for this sort of thing.
Â 
True, true.Â 


Â 


Â 
1. I expect that's definitely part of the reason. It's really only very recently (partly because of ASOIAF/GOT) that fantasy is being seen as a respectable, adult genre so it's up for heavy scrutiny and perhaps the sex scenes are seen by some as "trying" too hard to be adult.
Â 
2. This is perhaps a project for some time other than half 9 in the morning. But it would certainly be interesting to do. I have some suggestions for how the information in the LF sex monologue could have been conveyed elsewhere but to be honest my suggestion more pertains to not taking away all of LFs subtlety rather than the sex.
Â 
3.There are very few (if any sex scenes) which are entirely for titillation, but that's only to be expected in any medium other than pornography. All of the sex scenes do of course have a context within the show that makes some degree of sense. However it can't be denied that titillation is a major part of many of these scenes and often I feel that the context is simply an excuse for said titillation. The main reason I feel that D+D's sex scenes change the tone of the work is that Martin's sex scenes are rarely actually meant to be sexy. A few happen to be sexy but most aren't really and instead the sex itself is serving some purpose, whether it's plot or characterisation. D+D have turned it the other way around. The sex scenes are all supposed to be sexy and some happen to have plot development in them. It's rarely the sex itself which is part of the plot development though. Most of the sex scenes in the show further the plot through the infamous sexposition method. But there's rarely any real connection between the sex and the exposition. They're just placed awkwardly next to each other, like D+D were desperately thinking of some way to make their sex scenes seem valid additions to the plot. The sex itselfÂ is rarely plot relevant and when it is it's pretty much always (always always?) from the books. And of course there's the rather baffling choice of putting plot important information in the same scene as boobs.

2548	Beric175	2014-04-18	If this thread implies that the writing quality between ASOS and ADWD has declined, well.....
2549	Roose Seal	2014-04-18	The dialogue has never been the show's strong suit but over time it's becoming ridiculously overwrought.
The chicken thing at the inn in 401 was trying way too hard to be like this Tarantino-esque banter but it just went on and on and it wasn't that clever or amusing.
Other dialogue that seems zingy at first just doesn't make any sense like:
"They killed Lommy"Â 
"What the fuck's a Lommy?"Â 
While that may be funny, it doesn't make any sense - why would the Hound say "whatÂ the fuck's a lommy" and not "who the fuck is Lommy"? as "they killed X" is a clear indication that X is a person. The line comes off as forced and unnatural to get a cheap laugh.Â 
The banter between characters in 402 definitely felt like it was too clever for its own good.Â 
I don't know if it's the delivery or the lines themselves, but the scenes were just one overwrought zinger after the other. Like the Oberyn/Tywin/Cersei scene where each was trying to one-up the other, it was just ridiculous.
Â 
Olenna has had some really terrible one-liners as well butÂ "Not now Mace I'm speaking to Tywin" just made me roll my eyes.Â 
Â
2550	Wsaharan	2014-04-18	The problem, as I see it, is that every conversation between the main characters have to include references to all the different plotlines (ongoing as well as up-and-coming). There's Rhaegar & Lyanna, Dorne, Iron Bank, etc etc. And you can really feel that it's all about reminding viewers of different plotlines. "Iron Bank, ok? Did you get that?"
2551	Newstar	2014-04-18	The Huffington Post actually compiled every scene that contained nudity and/or sexual content for the first three seasons, and the total amount of screen-time came out to approximately 16 minutes for the first two seasons, and approximately 9 minutes in the third season. So 25 minutesÂ total, that features any sexual content, out of approximately 25 hours (taking the opening and ending credits, as well as the actual episode lengths into account). And, contrary to 'popular' belief, a lot of that material is focused on elements directly relating to the story line or the characters, while others are simple 'sexposition'.Â 
Â 
I'm no prude, so it never bothered me much in the first place, but there are plenty of shows on cable that feature a similar amount of sexual content and/or nudity that don't get even half the flack thatÂ Game of ThronesÂ receives.Â 


Â 
I think GOT is probably pretty light in the sexual content department. There aren't that many scenes of characters actually having sex, now that I think about it. Lots of precoital making out/rolling around and postcoital cuddling, but not a lot of the actual act itself. Maybe some of that has to do with time constraints: why go the trouble of showing characters banging when one can imply it?
Â 
There seems to be a lot of nudity, on the other hand (mostly female), and a lot of it seems purely gratuitous. Some of it I don't mind--I kind of love the situations where the female characters deliberately use their nudity as a show of confidence and strength (like Dany with Daario in 3x08)--but so much of it seems so unnecessary. The prostitutes didn't need to be undressed when Oberyn and Ellaria were picking them out. Osha didn't need to be naked to seduce Theon (she could have made out with him or something). Margaery didn't need to be naked to try to seduce Renly. And so on.
Â 
was trying way too hard to be like this Tarantino-esque banter
Â 
I thought the same thing.
Â

Â 
GRRM was writing a lot of that dialogue, though, and to be brutally honest, "too clever for its own good" sums up a lot of his dialogue. I enjoy it, but I agree it can be really grating.

I think his dialogue in the books is okay, sometimes a little overwrought but it fits the style and when you're reading you can just gloss over it if it's too much. On screen, add to it the hamfisted delivery and it becomes a little obnoxious.
Or underwhelming: I just remembered the Tywin/Jaime scene in 401. That was particularly flat and uninspired.

Polliver does not notice how short a fuse Sandor has and keeps pushing the envelope.That dialog is right out of A FIST FULL OF DOLLARSClint Eastwood: "I don't think it's nice, you laughin'. You see, my mule don't like people laughin'. Gets the crazy idea you're laughin' at him. Now if you apologize like I know you're going to, I might convince him that you really didn't mean it..."The fact that it's got the quirky 'chicken' twist to it is just great to my ears because it builds the tension in an off center way.I notice the Hound does not really take off on Polliver until Polliver has asked to trade a chicken for Arya.For the 14th century milieu that's probably not much of a thing to some ignorant soldiers , but apparently Sandor has something against it, and it sets him off.Great scene and great dialog.Arya's mirroring of the MERCY chapter is well almost perfect, tho George did it better.

Â The lack of equal-opportunities nudity is probably what bugs me more than the nudity itself, if I'm honest. And I'm approaching this as someone who appreciates naked ladies and men in equal amounts. I mean, prosthetic Hodor wang, nightmare fuel merchant wang and full-frontal Theon is a bit of a poor show compared to the sheer amount of boobs & bits we've seen from the ladies - hell, the number of bit-part actresses hired ostensibly to show off their ladyparts is probably relatively high.
Â 
I'm not troubled by the sex and nudity - it's not excessive when you take everything into account (although the Littlefinger brothel speech just felt clumsy as hell, imo.) If they'd just do the ladies a favour and give us some more naked man-butt, at least things would feel a little more balanced.
Â 
Re: the dialogue. I think it's hard to cram all of the subtleties and fine details of the books into an hour of TV, hence why some of the dialogue comes off as stilted - this is particularly problematic with the more introverted characters (Jon and Stannis are prime examples of this IMO, and a lot of Jon's S3 dialogue felt pretty stiff and awkward, partly because in the book, the majority of those scenes were explored through internal monologue - never an easy thing to convey on screen.)
Â 
The writers have a tendency to hit you in the face with exposition and worldbuilding - 'as you know, Bob' type dialogue, rather than play the long game and ease details into the dialogue. Whether this is a failing on the part of the writers, or whether the writers are working towards a TV audience which, largely, has little patience for the long game, I don't know.

Â Just to throw an example out there - Brienne and Cersei's exchange re: Jaime. Cersei bluntly states 'you love him', thus clueing in the viewer immediately - the alternative route would've been a lot of shipteasing and slow build, sort of a 'does she/doesn't she' dynamic. But the restraints of having ten hour-long episodes as opposed to the size of the books mean that a lot of viewers would potentially lose interest, or the slow build would get lost beneath the myriad other plot threads occurring at the same time.
Â 
TV audiences are complex, I think, especially with a show like GoT which carries with it a dedicated fanbase who are very knowledgeable about the world, its mythology and the characters who inhabit it. You have to please those fans, but also the more casual fans, who turn up for a story as opposed to an hour of complex dialogue hinting at certain outcomes, with the payoff a long way off.

Â 
For what it's worth, I generally like the dialogue. I watch the show with my husband, who's never read the books, and (excluding things the show leaves out) his understanding of the world & story is not far off my own, so the show's obviously doing something right, whether a person is a fan of the style or not.
Â 
There's definitely a tendency to throw nuggets of information into dialogue, and sometimes this comes off a little lumpenÂ - one example which springs immediately to mind is Jon & Sam's "Why's my surname Snow?" exchange. But again, it's a matter of perspective. I'm sure many viewers aren't bothered by the things which bother me - andÂ vice-versa (I know 'what the fuck's a Lommy?' makes little sense but I laughed anyway.)
Â 
With regards to the thread title...I don't think the dialogue is any better or worse than it has been. You have to take it on a scene-by-scene basis. Some of the worst writing, imo, can be attributed to writing complex and/or introverted characters - very hard to successfully convey their feelings through dialogue when they tend to express themselves internally in the books.
2562	Bolton's Bastard	2014-04-25	Sansa saying "It's the only place where no one talks to me." stuck out for me as being particularly bad. They could have written it in a more elegant fashion.
2563	Snows Queen	2014-04-27	My biggest complaint is the way the show is depicting the Jaime and Cersei.  I feel it a great disservice to the character of Jaime in the books.

I think the next time we see her is during trial. At least I hope so.

By showing the whole Cersei/Tywin scene and all the 'Sansa's maid knows!' Varys nervously reminding Tyrion of everything audience already knew from Tywin in s3, they are lessening the gigantic shock the reveal of Shae in bed was in the book.

Â 
Good point, and he did seem to be putting a lot of emphasis on "she's gone".Â
2575	Not a kneeler	2014-04-16	In the books it was readily apparent that Shae was using Tyrion because he was a wealthy Lannister, but in the HBO show I couldn't really tell because either the acting or the writing was off. It seems in the show that she really loves Tyrion.
Â 
Based on my feelings toward book Shae, I really hope she never leaves and the plot plays out the way it does in the books. I think, however that Tywin has her killed and the Tyrion kills Tywin for that reason. D&D have made every effort to simplify this story for the non book reader audience, and considering the books' complexity, I have trouble faulting them for that. It's like comparing peaches and carrotsÂ
2576	dbunting	2014-04-16	Shae is shown in the season trailer laying in a bed and we have not seen that yet, so to me that means she will be there when it all hits the fan.I could see her being a surprise witness at the trial just like in the books.Just not sure if Vary's lied to Tyrion to get Shae on the boat or if Bronn lied about her being on the boat. Or neither and Tywin had people watching the boats and found out on his own.
2577	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-04-16	Shae is not gone, she will testify against Tyrion and end up killed. The only part that might change is her in Tywin's bed, although I doubt it.Â

Â Or maybe the fact that we couldn't tell means the writing was spot on.

I think Bronn was intercepted with overwhelming numbers and made to hand her over.
2580	The 10th Penny King	2014-04-16	To have her testify at the trial would be crushing, but if they decide not to reveal her again till she's in Tywin's bed saying "My Lion"Â  -- that would be a great "shock" TV moment.
2581	gotgrrrl	2014-04-16	I think it makes sense that she winds up in Tywin's bed after the last interaction she has with Tyrion where he essentially says she's a whore and not "good enough" for him.Â  Unlike in the book where she sleeps with Tywin out of greed, Show Shae does it out of revenge, to get back at Tyrion for denying that their relationship was anything more than just sexual.Â  I wasn't a big fan of the last Tyrion/Shae scene myself but it does set up a situation in which Shae did/does love Tyrion but sleeps with Tywin for emotional rather than monetary reasons. Â

Â 


Â 
I agree to that. And I think, that Shae might have left the boat on her own account. Tyrion was pretty harsh to her - we know why, but she didn't really belief him, when he tried to get her to leave for her own safety and was emotionally crushed. That's a pretty good motive for revenge imo.
2583	Solanna	2014-04-16	That was one of the worst pieces of crying I have ever seen. Boooo Shae. The worst acting on GoT goes to the actress in that scene.
Made me cringe on my seat
So the less we see of her, the better it is.


Â 
I was thinking she was just acting in the scene and wasn't truly crying. But I never liked Shae, neither in the books nor in the show. I think she'll be back to testify in the court against Tyrion and probably show up in Tywin's bed as well.
2584	Floop	2014-04-16	Given the strength of Shae and Tyrion's relationship on the television show up until this point, I would find it more plausible if the Lannisters killed her and Tyrion killed Tywin out of revenge. The possibility does exist that things will play out as they did in the book, but this would be an odd choice, in my opinion. I'm OK with the show making changes as long as they are consistant with those changes. The complete 180 that Tyrion would have to make to kill Shae would be very hard to pull off. They are a talented bunch of writers and directors, however, so if anyone can make it happen, they can.

Â 
Well, seeing as Shae will likely testify against him, pretty much sentencing him to death, then be found in his father's bed wearing the expensive gold chain he bought her...Yeah I think that could set him off
2586	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-16	. The complete 180 that Tyrion would have to make to kill Shae would be very hard to pull off.Â 


Â 
They could pull it off by:
Â 
Step 1 - Shae testifies against Tyrion
Step 2 - Tyrion finds Shae in Tywin's bed.
Â 
Problem solved.
2587	Frumpus	2014-04-16	Yeah I really don't see them deviating from the books with regards to Shae. They have set her up perfectly to follow the course set for her in the books.

I'm aware of what happens in the books, but I don't think that would override the months of close relations that Tyrion has had with a legitimately loving character. Also, he sent her away and called her a whore in the last episode. If she were to strike back against him, she would even have a motive for it - and not the same motive she had in the book (greed and basically being an empty character that was never really loyal) - and a character as smart as Tyrion would not be blind to the fact that he would have caused her treachery against him with his words and abandonment of her. For him to murder her knowing that is a stretch. Also, it wouldn't make much sense to put her in Tywin's bed, unless we are to learn that she has always been a character that she has not appeared to be for her entire run on the show, which would also be quite a stretch.

Â 
I don't know, being condemned to die by a woman you tried repeatedly to save but wouldn't listen, and then finding her in the bed of your father who has done nothing but chastise you your entire life, and threatened to hang that same whore causing you months of grief and concern...That could set someone of. People have killed for much less.Â

Â 
I believe I said it in my two posts. The show has taken a much different approach with Shae and with Tyrion and Shae's relationship. They would be screwing things up on the show if things played out as they happened in the book at this point.
Â 
Many of those who have read the books seem to have a difficult time distinguishing between book Shae and the vastly different show Shae. Remember, this is the Shae that helped Sansa hide the fact that she was able to bear children. This is the Shae that needed to be close to Tyrion, not out of greed, but out of what genuinely appeared to be love. There is also a wit and cleverness to this Shae, although it was mainly only present in her introductory episode. From this good-hearted, loving, fairly smart character stems a much different relationship between her and Tyrion, and it makes sense because it seems as if he has legitimately met his match. This isn't the relationship, born of denial and make-believe, between a john and his prostitute that exists in the book.

Not really.Â  Tyrion was in love with her in the book, so his feelings for her haven't changed.Â  The conversation they have in this ep is almost word for word what Tyrion is thinking for a book and a half when it comes to Shae.Â  The fact that she actually does love him and despite that STILL testifies against him and STILL sleeps with his father for money would give him more reason than the book to do what he does.Â  In the book he knows in the back of his mind that this was always a possbility, in the show he doesn't think she could ever do something like that.Â  Not to him.

I found his murder of Book Shae, a wholly unsympathetic character with zero redeeming qualities to be disgusting and unjustified. Â Him murdering TV Shae, the goody goody whore with a heart of gold who loves him so much she refused to leave KL will be worse by about a factor of 100.

It never occurred to you even once that everything TV Shae did was mostly just an act?
Â 
Not that it matters, because we'll never know whether Shae was working for Tywin from the start or whether she was simply coerced into testifying against Tyrion. He kills her with the limited knowledge he has about what really happened and there's no going around that. Her actions on the show and in the book are almost identical despite the extra layer of sympathy she appears to generate on the tv show.
Â 
To be fair, there's still the chance that they change things up on the tv show and have Shae being executed on Tywin's orders, rather than Tyrion killing her. It could be part of the whitewashing show Tyrion has gotten so far.

2596	Lord Jennings	2014-04-16	i think the show Shae takes way too many liberties for being a whore. I thought she was much more submissiveÂ in the books when in the show she is a very strong, defiant character. They've done a good job setting her up to follow the books path. IMO

Â 
That's a really good point. His killing of book Shae didn't sit particularly well with me either regardless of how she was drawn, and yes, his killing of show Shae would be much, much worse.
Â 
Â

Â 
The thought has crossed my mind because I have read the books, but were I a person that only watched the show, the possibility would have never crossed my mind. In my opinion, they have given no indication that she has been insincere in her words and actions on the show.

Tyrion found book shae naked in his fathers bed after she just testified against him (which would have had him put to death)Â and mocked him in front of every one.Â Not unjustified.

Murders are seldom unmotivated, but opinions about what does and does not justify such an extreme and barbaric act will vary from person to person.
Â 
His fate was sealed without her testimony, and adultery and mockery hardly justify murder, even in a fictional world. Plus, he had some understanding of who and what she was. He shouldn't exactly have been blindsided by all of it.

Â 
I think the term 'justified' is being thrown around too loosely.Â  I don't consider killing people in war 'justified' personally, however it is understandable and common in this world.Â  Most of the death and destruction in this world isn't 'justified'.Â  However, with that being said I think it is understandable from a character perspective that he kills shae for what she did in the setting we've been presented, right after being told that his father paid a group of men to rape his first wife.Â  People have died for WAY less, and even character favorites have taken lives for less, including Ned, Stannis, Robert, all of the Lannisters, Arya, the Hound...
Â 
It's a cruel world where people are rewarded with death for treachery, which is exactly what she and Tywin got.Â  Even with this more sympathetic Shae I still don't find the act to be all that terrible in the grand scheme of things.

Â 
Â 
Look I agree that changing Shea into a character that loved Tyrion causes issues. GRRM said he was concerned about how that can play out as well. And yet her betrayal then his 'crime of passion' are still explainable, despite being messier than the book scenario.
2604	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-04-16	Nothing about Shae's current circumstance makes any sense. Â Tywin already knew who she was, otherwise he wouldn't have instructed Tyrion not to bring her to KL.

You're right, I'd forgotten about that. Â So we just have Cersei being stupid and Tywin making idle threats.

Which does make one wonder how Cersei could have been such an idiot. Â "I hear my brother is falling in love with a whore. Â I'd better not bother finding out who it is by having someone keep an eye on his room, or make note of who needlessly enters and exits the Tower of the Hand - I'll just make a random assumption based on a necklace."
2611	Martin Rheaume	2014-04-16	The thing that pisses me off about TV Shae is that she came on the scene as if she were an interesting character with a hidden back story. It seemed like there was more than meets the eye. I watched the first two seasons before I read any of the books, so I thought she was going to be a very significant character, and was going to bring a lot to the table. After reading the books, I can't understand why the TV writers set us up for such disappointment.Â 
Â 
During the second season, I found her to be a very intriguing character, but she has gotten steadily worse. I want to roll my eyes every time she's on the screen.Â 
Â 
I don't know if she'll be back or not, but book Shae got exactly what she deserved. If someone lies about me at my trial, and is part of a plot to get me killed, you're my enemy for life!

Â 
Â 
Basic information gathering - Does a whore exist?Â 
Â 
If yes then proceed to deeper information gathering - What is whore's identity?
Â 
What is special about this one is that Tywin was quite clearly drawing a line in the sand after the thousands of other whores. "There shall be no more". Once he has found out there is a whore he can't act until he knows her identity.
Â 
Cersei wasn't being stupid. Tyrion and Shea had covered their tracks well enough until Shea got complacent.
Â 
We will find out soon enough if Tywin's threats were idle.

Â 
Cersei is stupid quite frequently. If anything she's waaaaaay smarter on the show. But what about it is that stupid? You see a whore wearing a necklace given clearly to her by your brother, if anything it's stupid to assume she isn't the whore, especially when you know she's from the North and would assume she followed Tyrion.Â 
Â 
Tywin made no idle threats. He said don't bring the whore to court, he finds out he's been defied, he then says the next whore he finds in his bed will be hanged. Only he never finds her. Now he has, we will see.
2614	Ser Lepus	2014-04-16	Shae isn't that relevant to the plot, and her character has been changed a lot from how it was in the books. The writers could easily remove her participation in the trial and her servicing Tywin.
Â 
Book Shae, if told that Tywin was going to kill them and offered a bunch of diamonds, would have taken the diamonds and have run away. All she ever wanted was money, a fancy manse and a high class husband, and Varys was offering her all that.
2615	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-04-16	Nothing about Shae's current circumstance makes any sense. Â Tywin already knew who she was, otherwise he wouldn't have instructed Tyrion not to bring her to KL.


Â Tywin knew he had a whore, but didn't know her identity until 2 episodes ago.
2616	mcmnky	2014-04-16	Tywin knew he had a whore, but didn't know her identity until 2 episodes ago.I think Tywin has known about Shae--in both books and show--for a long time, perhaps all the way back to the first meeting with Tyrion.My take on Shae is she is either 1) stupid, 2) suicidal, or 3) spying on Tyrion for Tywin.Tyrion is repeatedly warning Shae to keep a low profile, trying to tell her what his father does to Tyrion's whores. Perhaps at first she might have thought Tyrion was being overly dramatic, or just wanted to keep Shae a secret. But she's been around the Lannisters long enough to know they do not joke around with stuff like that.We know she's with Tyrion for the money. But why the constant forays to his room? The pleas to be brought in to the castle? If he's going to pay you to go away, to pay you to not fark him, why not take the money?So either she doesn't realize Tyrion is not exaggerating at all about his father, and she doesn't realize what danger she is in, and so 1) she is stupid. Or she is hoping to get caught, and so 2) she is suicidal.Or, and this seems most likely Shae does not seem stupid or suicidal, she is not concerned about getting caught by Tywin because Tywin already knows about her. That he knows and hasn't had her tortured or killed means, 3) she is working for Tywin.
2617	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-04-16	I think Tywin has known about Shae--in both books and show--for a long time, perhaps all the way back to the first meeting with Tyrion.

Â Â  Its possible that Shae was working for Tywin, but it seems to me unlikely. Since Tywin has been back in KL, Tyrion has really been in no position of power, except as master of coin, so I don't see a huge motivation for Tywin bothering with Shae spying on him. I think Tywin sees Tyrion as a boob and a failure, and he already knows about Tyrion's shenanigans. He would have to be paying her a lot in order for her to refuse a bag of diamonds from Varys that could haveÂ bought her with a house and servants for the rest of her life [according to Varys]. He's tight with his money, and I just don't see him caring that much about what Tyrion does. And if he did bother to have Shae spy for him, his m.o would be more along the lines of "if you want to continue living, you'll do this for me" rather than "here's a nice big salary of gold for you, as long as you keep doing this for me". I actually think the show is playing her role as straightforward, and she loves Tyrion. I think in both the show and the book, Shae is more naAve than anything, leading her to carelessness around the castle.

2618	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-04-17	No, Tywin didn't learn the identity of Tyrion's whore until "Two Swords", when Cersei's spy reported it. The show has made this pretty clear.
2619	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-04-17	Â 
We will find out soon enough if Tywin's threats were idle.


Â 
Maybe 'idle' isn't the best word, but he made a demand of Tyrion which he was apparently in absolutely no position to enforce - or even know whether it had been violated. Â The fact that Ros was killed in Shae's place supports, not contradicts, that.
Â 
Perhaps 'incompetent' or 'futile' would be more appropriate, but neither is a term generally associated with Tywin.

Â 
This is fact? I thought Ros was killed because Baelish wanted to tie up a loose end.
Â 
I agree 100% that Tywin was previously in no position to enforce it - because he wasn't there. He was prosecuting a war. CerseiÂ was there, yet even with her network of spies she was unable to find out the real identity of the whore until Shae became complacent. She clearly knew there was a whore though, hence the arrest and beating of Ros and the obvious passing on of that knowledge to Tywin when he reclaimed the title of Hand.

Agreed. Ros's death seemed to be more about her betrayal to LF than Cersei thinking she was Tyrion's (although the actual reason was because the actress didn't want to do more naked scenes).

Â 
Is that true, she didn't want to do more nude scenes?Â  That could explain the idea of her becoming more of an assistant to LF and then a clothes wearing spy for Varys.Â  I had no idea.Â  I do agree that Ros's death was about LF tying up loose ends and getting rid of someone who betrayed him along with it allowing him to make nice with Joff.Â  Now I'm wondering about the guy Olyvar in the brothel who seems to be moving up, or trying to move up, to clothes wearing assistant.Â

I was conceding it as fact because (1) it's not the point and (2) complicity in Ros's death would have been the only thing to make Tywin's threat completely toothless.

Shae was in Tywin's camp when Tyrion met her, not KL.

I'm not saying it's the biggest deal in the world, I just honestly don't understand how you guys are rationalizing the contradictions. Â Either Shae was important or she wasn't.

Threatening Tyrion is likely a different animal. He's doing it more out of hatred and spite for his son, than for any political gain. He may figure that the threat itself is enough to make his son's life miserable. ForÂ the time being, at least.Â He had many other fish to fry at that time, and his lack of discovering Shae sooner may simply show where this matter falls on his list of priorities, rather than any incompetence on his part.

This means it can be reasonably expected that there would be hundreds or even thousands of whores amongst the camp followers. There is no reason to presume her knew her identity.

Â  Agreed. There is really no contradiction here. It just depends on how many angles a person is willing to view something from. I hadn't thought of the idea that he was testing Tyrion, giving him a chance to rid himself of his vices, without Tywin's intervention, but that is another possible [even likely] ingredient in this mix.

Â  Sure, I think it would. An idle threat doesn't necessarily mean a threat without any purpose at all. An idle threat can be performed to scare someone or make them perform certain actions, or just generally cause misery. I think that's what most idle threats would be meant for: intimidation and menacing.Â It would be rare for someone to make a threat with no purpose whatsoever.

Â He initially found out about Shae while at a war camp, where everyone was packed close together and easily spied on. And he had reason to keep many eyes on the camp at that time, for fear of traitors or spies from the Wolf's side. So its not surprising that someone reported to him that his son had a whore. Back at King's Landing was a different matter, the spies themselves have agendas and loyalties are more convoluted. In addition, as others have said above, Tywin's motivation to immediately follow through on threats to Tyrion may have been low, and he may have been waiting to see what Tyrion did of his own accord. There seems to be no real contradiction here. As for the test not having validity.. it did have validity. Tywin already hated Tyrion, he already was loath to leave Casterly Rock to him, the idea of Tyrion disobeying him about the whore just adds another reason for him to deny Tyrion his birthright. He would naturally grasp at the idea that Ros was his whore, without botheringÂ to verify it further. It was what he wanted to hear.
2630	TheFullmetalAlchemist	2014-04-17	There arent that many places they can go with this. Either she will be intercepted by Tywin or Bronn/Varys betrayed him. Those are really the only options if they want to continue with the original story.Â

Â 
I am trying to process what you are saying here, so I have a few questions.
Â 
"Tywin thinks that Tyrion failed the test because of Ros, while remaining completely ignorant to the truth that Tyrion actually failed the test because of Shae." OK, I am following your chain of thought thus far.
Â 
"If the test matters enough to issue it, and Tyrion's failure matters enough to punish him for it, then why does the validity of the answer not matter? " I don't say it doesn't matter. There was a whore in Tyrion's bed while he was Hand. Tywin punished him for it then said "If I find any more whores in your bed I will hang them" This means, 'if you do it again I will exact more punishment.'
Â 
"And if it does matter, why would he depend on clearly unreliable sources for the proof when he could easily have gotten a definitive answer while the whore in question was right under his nose?" Please explain the easy way he could gained the definitive answer.
Â 
"He found out about Shae and learned of her importance while prosecuting a war - why would it not have been equally as easy (easier, I'd argue) to learn her identity?" No. He found out about Shae at the breakfast before the wedding. If he did think that Ros was the whore from the army camp as you have previously claimed, I don't understand why you also claim heÂ simultaneouslyÂ knew that Shae was also the whore from the army camp.
Â 
"Â the less his carelessness is explicable." I am yet to see any demonstration of carelessness on Tywin's part. It is inexplicable because it has not been demonstrated to exist.
Â 
Tywin issued a rule.
Tyrion broke the rule.
Tywin punished him and issued a new rule

2634	Asha Greyjoy:Feminist Icon	2014-04-17	I think, however that Tywin has her killed and the Tyrion kills Tywin for that reason.

Literally my biggest fear for the season. This. Because...D&D have made every effort to simplify this story for the non book reader audience, and considering the books' complexity, I have trouble faulting them for that. It's like comparing peaches and carrotsÂ 

Up to and including the stripping away of any moral complexity Tyrion could have had. One of the more interesting and psychologically complex characters in the series and a true expert at fudging the numbers when doing moral calculus, BookTyrion is fascinating to analyze and try to understand. It can be challenging at times to find yourself cheering him on for something that was kind of a dick move or even outright cruel. That's part of the character's appeal. 
Sadly this guy doesn't seem to be in any of my GOT files. But if anyone sees him please let me know.
2635	David Selig	2014-04-17	Shae isn't that relevant to the plot, and her character has been changed a lot from how it was in the books. The writers could easily remove her participation in the trial and her servicing Tywin.
Â 
Book Shae, if told that Tywin was going to kill them and offered a bunch of diamonds, would have taken the diamonds and have run away. All she ever wanted was money, a fancy manse and a high class husband, and Varys was offering her all that.


Not just Book Shae, pretty much anyone would have done so in her place. Stay and risk her life just so she can sneak around and have sex with Tyrion from time to time, or take the fortune, leave and enjoy a rich life. Show Shae's behaviour is completely idiotic.

Stay and risk her life just so she can sneak around and have sex with Tyrion from time to time, or take the fortune, leave and enjoy a rich life. Show Shae's behaviour is completely idiotic.TV Shae lacks even a basic sense of self-preservation, and if she comes back to KL, she will have proven to be outright suicidal. It would be difficult to justify her return, unless Bronn has captured her and sold her to Cersei, or something (she was carrying a bag of diamonds, Cersei would pay a nice sum for her, and Bronn is well, Bronn).In addition to being difficult to justify her return to KL without making her mentally challenged, the fact that she seems to care for Tyrion and doesn't seem so greed-driven as Book Shae, will make very difficult to shoehorn her into the same role Book Shae plays during the trial and Tywin's assassination. And I very much doubt they are going to make Tyrion strangle her, since he would look like a complete monster.So I think they will remove her from the TV series for now. The writers may make her meet Tyrion again in Essos.
2637	AuntDany	2014-04-17	Between the whitewashing of Show Tyrion (Frumpus quote) and added depth and independence of Show Shae (Floop quote), I think there's no chance the show has her betray Tyrion and him avenging himself by killing her.Â 
Â 
And yes it's still a possibility that Show Shae could stand it for Book Tysha (Fool of a Book quote). Tysha and what happened to her is an important part of Tyrion's future characterization and plot (sharp guilt, searching), so it needs to be on the show in some form...and since Tyrion called Shae a whore and gave her a cold sendoff, she could cause him feelings of guilt...


Â 

...between book Shae and the vastly different show Shae. Remember, this is the Shae that helped Sansa hide the fact that she was able to bear children. This is the Shae that needed to be close to Tyrion, not out of greed, but out of what genuinely appeared to be love. There is also a wit and cleverness to this Shae, although it was mainly only present in her introductory episode...



Â 
Â 


...To be fair, there's still the chance that they change things up on the tv show and have Shae being executed on Tywin's orders, rather than Tyrion killing her. It could be part of the whitewashing show Tyrion has gotten so far...

Â 
You are ruling out the even more obvious option. Tywin took even more offence to a Tyrion bringing a whore to Tywin's bed and this overruled the original rule. I reject the claim this made the original rule 'idle'.
Â 

Â 


Â  How could anyone even ascertain that this particular whore was significant to himÂ 



Â 
The significance of the whore is actually quite irrelevant given what Tyrion did was seen as a greater offence.

Â 


Â and why would that not be easily remedied by Tywin? Â He could have had someone fetch the whore who has been by Tyrion's side every waking moment in camp, he could have summoned Tyrion's companion Bronn for a description, he could have walked into Tyrion's fucking tent and seen her with his own eyes, he could have easily done a hundred different things.
Â 



Â 

*Â He could have had someone fetch the whore who has been by Tyrion's side every waking moment in camp, - Sure he could have done that, but then there would have been no point in giving Tyrion any responsibility on the matter. Also, your statement is hyperbole. She was absolutely not by his side every waking moment.
*Â Â he could have summoned Tyrion's companion Bronn for a description - sure he could have done that, but he gave an order and expected it to be carried out and it became irrelevant anyway when Tyrion committed a greater offence
*Â he could have walked into Tyrion's fucking tent and seen her with his own eyes, - Sure he could have done that, but see the answer to the previous point
*Â Â he could have easily done a hundred different things. - See answer to both previous points

Tywin issued a rule. Â (don't take that whore to KL)
Tyrion broke the rule. Â (he took the whore to KL)
Tywin punished him for something else completely. Â (he brought a whore to his bed)
Â 
Â 






Â 
OK, I see where your three options come from now but I do not accept they are the only options.


Â 


Â 
Either violation of the rule didn't matter (toothless), he cared enough to issue it but not enough to accurately enforce it (capricious), or he mistakenly enforced the wrong rule (incompetent). Â 

Â 


Â 

or, Tyrion committed a greater offence.
Â 
Consider this
Â 
Tywin: Â Do not commit manslaughter
Tyrion then commits murder
Tywin punishes Tyrion for murder
Â 
This does not make the prohibition on manslaughter idle, toothless, capricious or incompetent. He was punished for having any whore in Tywin's bed and having any whore in his bed after he lost rights to the Rock. The fact we know it was the same whore from the camp is just simply irrelevant.

Â 
By your analogy, Tyrion committed both manslaughter and murder, manslaughter was the only 1 of those 2 which was explicitly forbade, and Tywin still has no fucking clue that he committed it. Â When a crime goes completely ignored and unpunished, is that a good or bad job by the authorities?
2640	Newstar	2014-04-17	Sibel Kekilli did an interview very recently which seemed to confirm implicitly that they're going the hell hath no fury like a woman scorned route with Shae.
2641	Konradsmith	2014-04-17	Will she only return for ep. six in the trial or does anyone think we'll see her between now and then?
2642	Scrambled Aegon	2014-04-17	I think what I've always thought -- Shae still betrays Tyrion, Tyrion still kills her for it, and it still wouldn't be wholly out of character at all.
Â 
But now they have changed her reason for betraying him. In the books, it's just that she was a whore finding a better client -- something I think would have been believable in the show up to this point. Now, though, her betrayal is personal - it's as revenge for Tyrion sending her away. It makes her a more sympathetic character. I'm not sure how I feel about that at all.

Â 
Where I am, we have double jeopardy. You can't get tried twice for the same offence. It is either manslaughter or murder, not both. We also have concurrent sentencing, not consecutive.Â 
Â 
Tywin will have a clue about it when he questions Shea, but given that Tyrion committed a greater offence taking the camp whore with him just pales into insignificance... there the tiny little matter of Tyrion currently being charged with regicide.
Â 
"When a crime goes completely ignored and unpunished, is that a good or bad job by the authorities?" Can be a good job if the scale difference of the offences means pursuing the smaller one results in a pointless punishment and a waste of time and resources.
Â 
Also, calm down with the language please

In this case they are 2 completely separate acts, so double jeopardy doesn't apply. Â You obviously can't accidentally kill somebody and then later murder the same person. Â If you run over 1 person with your car then get out and shoot another in the head, you'll be charged with both murder and manslaughter - unless the authorities are unable to connect you to the first crime. Â Issuing a more severe punishment to you for murder doesn't explain away the other dead body, and unless you live in Pyongyang that wouldn't pass for justice in your jurisdiction either.

Â 
And in that scenario the murder might result in a 12-20 and the vehicular manslaughter might result in 3-6. But consecutive sentencing rules would mean the maximum would still be 20. If there were additional offences like running a red light then the $300 fine would be waived given its insignificance.
Â 
In Tyrion's case, he has had his rights to the Rock removed. He was 'rewarded' with Master of Coin. He would be devastated if he lost that job. He was also rewarded with Sansa Stark - the love of his life. Losing her and not having to deal with all those friendly and not resentful Northmen would well... you get the picture. Any punishment that could be brought for bringing the camp whore to KL would either be pointless due to its insignificance to subsequent punishments or be out of scale with the crime (perhaps disownment - no more money, gelding, blinding etc).Â 
Â 
Given that he is currently facing the death sentence for regicide and Shae is in a position to plea-bargain her way out of her own punishment, then hitting him with the '$300 fine for the red light' (aka taking the whore to KL) is irrational, petty and asinine.

I began this conversation wondering how you got around the contradiction in logic - you've clearly demonstrated the answer.
Â 
By the way, sentencing guidelines don't apply when the authorities are ignorant to the fact that a crime even occurred, and if violation of his admonishment was tantamount to running a red light than it was an idle threat.

I absolutely disagree it was an idle threat. As I have already explained, he has had his rights to Casterly Rock revoked already and then demonstrated that a punishment for transporting a whore would either be so insignificant in comparison it would be pointless and petty or would be so large that the scale of the punishment would just not fit the crime.

Â 
Tywin cared enough to make the demand that Tyrion not take the whore to KL, Tywin made no effort whatsoever to ascertain the identity of the whore (ergo he made absolutely no effort to enforce the demand), and Tyrion has defied the demand completely without consequence (we know that Tywin hasn't simply ignored it as a lesser offense because even at this point in the show he has absolutely no way of even knowing that he'd been defied).
Â 
A demand that you can't enforce and for which there is no penalty for defying is an idle threat. Â Tywin doesn't make idle threats (contradiction). Â If Tywin cared enough to take time away from his war effort to make the threat it doesn't make sense that he would have absolutely no interest in enforcing it (contradiction).
Â 
My favorite part about this is that, with your current take on the matter, you're making the argument that his demand was an idle threat and you don't even seem to realize it (if he made the demand, knows he was defied, and now doesn't feel it's important enough to warrant a punishment, that is an idle threat).

Â  Denying Tyrion Casterly Rock, IS part of the punishment, as many have stated above. Its likely the one Tywin has been after all along: more reasons to deny Tyrion his birthright. But I think a big part of Tywin's game is just making Tyrion as miserable as possible, out of spite.

Â 


Â 
First you say
"Â Tywin made no effort whatsoever to ascertain the identity of the whoreÂ "
Â 
Then you say
"Â even at this point in the show he has absolutely no way of even knowing that he'd been defied"
Â 

Â I agree absolutely with the second statement. Because he did not know he had been defied, why on Earth would he waste any energy whatsoever attempting to ascertain the identity of someone he didn't know existed? Why would the police go looking for a bank robber when there is no evidence a bank robbery took place? I have no idea what point you are trying to make here.
Â 


Â 
A demand that you can't enforce and for which there is no penalty for defying is an idle threat. Â Tywin doesn't make idle threats (contradiction). Â If Tywin cared enough to take time away from his war effort to make the threat it doesn't make sense that he would have absolutely no interest in enforcing it (contradiction).
Â 



Â 
So your first assertion here is:
Â 
Statement A:Â A demand that you can't enforce and for which there is no penalty for defying is an idle threat.
Statement B:Â Â Tywin doesn't make idle threats
Statement C: Therefore, contradiction
Statement D: Â it doesn't make sense that he would have absolutely no interest in enforcing it
Statement E: Therefore, contradiction
Â 
I accept your definition at point A as being a reasonable definition
I accept the claim at point B as being a reasonable representation of Tywin Lannister's personality
I reject your conclusion at point C because it is a logical fallacy.
You have not demonstrated that the threat was idle because Tywin was unable to enforce it and that there would have been no penalty for it. Further, you are claiming Tywin has no interest in enforcing it. This is completely unrelated to the two previous assertions and is therefore irrelevant.

Â 
I accept the claim made at point D, yes, as written, that makes no sense
I reject your conclusion made at point E because it is a false dichotomy.
You have not demonstrated that is the only option. I have already demonstrated there are other options - punishment already meted out for other offences that make any new punishment pointless due to insignificance and other reasons previously demonstrated.
Â 


Â 
My favorite part about this is that, with your current take on the matter, you're making the argument that his demand was an idle threat and you don't even seem to realize itÂ 


Â 
This is a strawman. You are attempting to misrepresent my position.
Â 
Firstly, he will only discover he was defied once he questions Shae.
Tyrion has already been punished for taking whores to Tywin's bed.
Tyrion is currently facing capital punishment for regicide.
The offence of transportation of whores is quite clearly insignificant compared to the second and in all reasonable likelihood far less than the first

Â 

Â 


Â 
if he made the demand, knows he was defied, and now doesn't feel it's important enough to warrant a punishment, that is an idle threat

Â 




Â 
This is in part a 'moving the goal posts' fallacy. You laid out the definitions of 'idle threat' above and are now attempting to slip in a new definition of the term here. Your argument is internally inconsistent because the conclusion made here is not supported by your assertions above and I have also refuted many of those assertions.
Â 
----
Â 
Lets say you rob a bank (transport whores) - penalty 10 years once convicted
Lets say you then become a serial killer (whores in Tywin's bed) - penalty execution once convicted
Â 
Now, the second crime is discovered and you are convicted - ie, dead
Then the first crime is discovered. A determination is made that to carry out the sentence would be either so insignificant to be a waste of resources. This doesÂ notÂ mean the threat was idle - as per the very definition you asserted - quote "A demand that you can't enforce and for which there is no penalty for defying is an idle threat."

2655	The Tickler.	2014-04-19	In the books it was readily apparent that Shae was using Tyrion because he was a wealthy Lannister, but in the HBO show I couldn't really tell because either the acting or the writing was off. It seems in the show that she really loves Tyrion.
Â 
Based on my feelings toward book Shae, I really hope she never leaves and the plot plays out the way it does in the books. I think, however that Tywin has her killed and the Tyrion kills Tywin for that reason. D&D have made every effort to simplify this story for the non book reader audience, and considering the books' complexity, I have trouble faulting them for that. It's like comparing peaches and carrotsÂ 


Â 
Completely agree with this. I really don't like Shae in the book, and her eventual betrayal was not overly surprising.Â 
Â 
However I don't see the Shae of the series betraying Tyrion to extent she will have to too match the books.
2656	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-04-20	here are my thoughts on Shae if anyone cares:
Â 
I don't see anything at all wrong with the portrayal of Shae in Episode 1 and 2. Â Sorry, there I said it. Â She's a scared girl way out of her depth. Â Her only prestige is being Tyrion's personal mistress, and she knows it. Â "I am your whore, and when you are tired of fucking me, I will be nothing." -3x07 Â That same scene Tyrion gives her a gold chain and says she can buy a ship with it (a planted seed of doubt that grows in 3x10 with Varys, instilling further fear in Shae's mind). Â Same scene, she offers again (2x10) they go to Essos. Â In her mind, it's a huge insult to her that offer is flung back at her - but without Tyrion in 3x10.
Â 
4x01 she tries to win him back the way they got together Â - with sex. Â It's her last power and when he denies her even that, no matter what his reasons are, not only is she afraid he's sending her away forever, but she's afraid that he doesn't even find her attractive. It has nothing to do with Sansa. It's more "what am i doing wrong, baby??" than any "oh no, Sansa is better than me!" Her whole dialogue that people interpret as jealousy over the Sansa marriage in Season 3 is her trying to prove to Tyrion that he doesn't love Sansa (why else complain about a fact so obvious to them both?), she tries to prove that he CAN fight Tywin and Cersei. Â Really, jealousy over Sansa? Shae was a whore, she's used to being tossed around - which is why her lines are not jealousy nor stupidity (that's just plain out of character, given the TV interpretation). Â Shae is a fighter, a lover, a protector. Â 
Â 
4x02 she accuses he's afraid of Tywin and Cersei, and he looks away. Tyrion was a real asshole in that scene, shouting "You're a whore" in her face. I don't agree with despising Shae that she Â "should've seen through that Tyrion was trying to protect her." Â Those things are VERY hurtful to hear no matter what.
Â 
IMO, this still isn't enough for her to willingly betray Tyrion.Â Before 4x01 and 4x02, she'd probably let them kill her first. But under intense threat and behind closed doors with Cersei and Tywin and with Sansa MIA, she'll more than ease into testifying against Tyrion for her own life - the only thing she has at that moment of coercion. Â It'll be awful when Tyrion kills her over killing him for breaking up. Awful.
Â 
my 2c.
2657	Duckface	2014-04-20	I am afraid that Shae kills Tywin, not Tyrion.
2658	Varamyr Sixskins	2014-04-20	Agree with Floop (page 2). Shae in the TV series has taken on, by and large, the role of Tysha from the books, and I don't think that Tyrion will hold any resentment against her, even if she testifies against him in court. Rather, I think that Tywin will cruelly deport her from King's Landing but Tyrion will somehow find out about this, and then Tywin and Tyrion will have an exchange in the privy akin to this:
Â 
Tyrion: "What did you do with Shae?"Â 
Tywin: "I sent her away." + a few asinine remarks.
Tyrion: "Sent her away where?"
Tywin: "Wherever whores go."
(crossbow thrums)
2659	AzorAhai42	2014-04-22	I really thought the show was setting up the Shae/Tyrion story nicely, until the scene in this episode. It made me cringe. I agree with whoever said that was the worst acting in the entire series, to date. Plus, in the story, she did what she did because you found out, that deep down, she is just a whore. With this scene in this episode, if she does what she does in the book, it's because Tyrion hurt her feelings, and made her cry. It's a very bad change in my opinion. An uncharacteristically bad change. I must say this is the first show change that I fully disagree with. Every other show change has been somewhat necessary, but this is just a really missed opportunity for D&D I think.Â
2660	Mladen	2014-04-13	As usual, we discuss Sansa in this episode... Remember, this is thread dedicated to book/show parallels, so please have in mind that you might see book spoilers in this thread.
Â 
The Lion and the Rose episode has marked an important crossroad in Sansa's journey and I believe that Sophie Turner had another strong Martin-written episode. After her memorable performance in "Blackwater", GRRM truly did amazing job with emphasizing Ms. Turner's talent through Sansa's natural introspection. This was wonderful example of how TV can present a lot of things that are unsaid...
Â 
And the way Ms. Turner handled the dwarf show with Robb being mocked is truly wonderful. With the touch of brilliant music and long shots, it was truly heartbreaking to see her, but at the same time, it showed side of Sansa we all love. Her ability to endure, to maintain her composure when they are ripping her heart apart is truly admirable. And even more, to see it presented at TV show in that memorable way.Â 
Â 
The problem of course was the damn necklace and confusing storyline around it. Simply, it appears that they wanted to keep it a secret, but got some rather mixed-up results... There were no missing jewels on Sansa's necklace, both Tyrion and QOT were far from the cup at different moments... IDK, but, in their admirable desire to remain secret, they truly made a bit of mess...
Â 
For the end, nice touch Sansa getting up to give cup to Tyrion and his "better her than you" line...

Â 
Yeah the removal of the gem is definitely there - rewatch the scene carefully... Lady Olenna fiddles with Sansa's braids, and then briefly fingers the necklace - her hand curled as if holding something - then cut to Sansa's face and you can see the missing gem is high by her collar bone (her left, our right) next to her dress collar hem.
2663	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-14	Yep. I didn't even hear what Olenna was talking about in that scene because I was so absorbed in watching her hands, haha.
Â 
I'm pretty sure Joff picked up his goblet from in front of Lady Olenna on his second drink; but someone else will need to confirm that (can't re-watch at the moment).

Sansa's stoic poise throughout the dwarf entertainment was so well done. She was perfect.

I didn't really care for the way Dontos rushed her that way... but they've changed that whole story arc from front to back so of course now it seems so odd to have him suddenly show up with the special necklace and then whisk her away.Â

Less Dontos in the story overall. It's kind of sad that his whole trying to be a heroic knight again is lost, but I think this is mostly a casting thing driving it. Dontos role is shortened, but not gone.

2670	Indigocell	2014-04-14	The missing jewel was definitely apparent.Â  I went back to watch episode 1 when he gives her the necklace and it had 7 jewels.Â  After speaking with Olenna, there are only 6 jewels.Â  One of them is covered by her hair on her right side, but the one on the left is definitely missing.
2671	Cyberia	2014-04-14	At the same time Olenna takes the stone from Sansa's necklace, listen to what she's saying.Â  She's condemning Lannister actions at the Red Wedding, implying Joffery since he claims credit for winning the war, and subtly calling him a monster for killing a man at a wedding.Â  Notice she also implies herself with this line, albeit a more graceful and wise monster.Â  And as Tyrion says: Monsters are Dangerous.
Â 
But the conversation about the RW also reveals Olenna's motive for involving Sansa at all: Justice.Â  Olenna likes Sansa and thinks that what was done to her family was a crime.Â  She also knows Sansa is not in any position to seek any redress of this.Â  So, planning on killing Joffery anyway, she arranges to have the instrument of Joffery's death be borne by the last of the Stark family.Â  That Sansa knew nothing was simply done to protect her, but still...Â  The Starks send their regarrrrrrds.
Â 
Olenna put on a show of "this is how you wield power."Â  Joffery is dead.Â  Margery is the queen, or at least has a claim the Lannisters can't ignore.Â  The Starks got some justice.Â  Dontos isn't the type the Lannisters/Joffery would be monitoring, and he and Sansa are entering Witness Protection.Â  No one suspects the Tyrells at all despite the fact that she did it in front of ALL the Lannisters, the Kingsguard and all the Lords of the Realm.Â 
Â 
Well Played Lady Olenna
2672	Inv1ctus	2014-04-14	After Dontos said 'Come with me if you want to live' I was expecting Sansa to say 'and, who are you again?'
Â 
For the next episode I expect Dontos to say 'Get to da gally!'


Â 
Â 
Hahahah, this was super funny.Â
2673	Chebyshov	2014-04-14	Here's a shot of the missing jewel where it's a bit more obvious:Â http://i.imgur.com/V9zbhUV.jpg?1
Â 
I thought Dontos popping up there was super awkward, but they already took away most of Sansa's agency in the whole thing.

agreed. olenna really owns any scene she is in and in this scene, really showed where her loyalties lie and it was really cool of her to try to convey this to sansa. this is the type of writing grrm is known for. so glad he wrote this episode!

Â 
Â 
Definitely a brilliant power play by Olenna; but I disagree that she had any desire to avenge the Starks. Â She used Sansa as a pawn and scapegoat to shield herself and Margaery; and she had to know that Sansa would be accused of complicity. Â Olenna's actions also assured that Sansa would have to go into hiding, unable to use her own name, for a long time, possibly the rest of Sansa's life. Â 
Â 
Great acting by Sophie Turner (and most of the cast except for Shae).
2676	Woman of War	2014-04-14	I really loved Sophie Turner in that episode. I have not been a fan of Sansa so far but Turner's acting in the two first episodes has impressed me and starts to win me over for (at least HBO) Sansa. She has a brain, she shows emotions,  can be furious, she makes her position clear, and now her play shows that she has an understanding of the subtleties and power games that are going on. "And now we have a new Queen", her voice got so wonderfully cynical. Faced with Joffrey's cruelty Turner shows a dead face - let me disappear please - while at the same time giving a sideways glance of concern towards Tyrion, knowing that shit would soon hit the fan. We see every memory of her father's beheading at the dwarf jousting mirrored in her face, just like  shame about Tyrion's treatment. Did she recognize Ice? Tyrion and Sansa were equally disgusted about the book chopping. Before that Sansa and Tyrion both had passed that incredulous look towards Joffrey when he talked about reading and learning.
And the solidarity and empathy she showed to Tyrion when she passed the goblet, putting herself in the same humiliating position Tyrion was, under the table, two victims of Joffrey and yet proud, full of understanding for each other, great acting.

2677	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-04-14	I really can't add more than what was already said. Obviously, Sophie Turner did an excellent job b/c even my Unsullied hubby picked up on her emotional response to seeing the sword, which he only understood the significance of that sword scene in the first episode after I explained it to him. Â I haven't had a chance to rewatch it yet, but the whole display of the War of the 5 Kings was great - seeing her reaction and Tyrion's. Â I loved when she helped Tyrion with the goblet.
Â 
I saw the missing stone immediately, but like Koi - I zoned into the necklace as soon as Olenna came over to her and you can see what's happening and the missing jewel. Â
2678	Mladen	2014-04-14	Â 
Â 
As linked elsewhere, here is the shot of Olenna lifting the jewel from the necklace.

Â 
Wow, I totally missed that...
Â 
Furthermore, has anyone also noticed how camera zoomed to Olenna several times? I especially liked "cursed be he who seek to tear them asunder" by the HS, and Olenna in the shot (quite Eowyn moment )

In any case "come with me if you want to live" - the Dontonator ? Â Â

Â 
I am sorry, but I have to disagree with this. Olenna certainly had no Stark in her mind when she was doing this, both in books and TV show. Tyrells are doing this for the power, not to avenge anyone. As to Margaery, she has no claim, as the book series showed and as TV will too, as far as I have seen the promo for the next episode.
2679	Twilight Dragon	2014-04-14	There were no missing jewels on Sansa's necklace
Â 

1 was missing.
And QoT sitted right of Joffrey and was near the cup, when the pigeon pie was cut.
Sophie was awesome. From season to season she grows up as an actress stronger and stronger.
Â 
And the reaction of QoT and others to the dwarf performance is mostly confusing. Too much disrespect was shown to Sansa, Loras and other related characters.

Â 
I was always curious about why the Tyrells did it at the wedding when Margery would have no claim, but my guess is they thought it'd be better to keep her "a maiden" and set up her marriage with Tommen than let her be spoiled by a psychopath.Â

Agreed. A brief beautiful moment of (finally) understanding, before it all goes to shit.
2682	Colonel Green	2014-04-14	The fact that Turner can do so much with so little is one of the reasons it's so annoying that the writers so consistently reduce Sansa to a background character.
2683	dbunting	2014-04-14	I like the way this was done. You were still able to get the fact across that Dontos gave her the necklace, and then came to her aid during the chaos.Definitely missed most of what Olena said to Sansa as I was too busy looking at her hands and seeing her palm the "jewel".Loved the looks on Sansa when Joeffery mentioned using his sword would be like cutting Ned's head off every time, and then the jousting scene with the wolf head on Robb. She looked genuinely in pain. Great job.

Â 
i agree that olenna's main objective was, and is always, the betterment of the tyrells. but her words to sansa definitely show her understanding of the the stark situation and are meant to convey a sense of injustice and vengeance. but just a sense of it. the tyrells would never stick their necks out just because it was the right thing to do.

Â 
I assume given that Joffrey and Margaery were living separately before the wedding, that the wedding was seen as the last chance before he exercised his right. Plus, from LF's report, the Tommen was always the ultimate goal, and they couldn't have gotten rid off Joffrey that easily. Wedding, however was perfect situation.

True... In narrative sense, the PW was paying the debts of RW...Great justice for injustice we have seen. But, although Olenna might sympathize with Sansa, and TV show actually showed it better than the book series, truth is, she is there to win. She played Sansa once and the reason dictates that she would do it again. So, I agree... Tyrells were never stick their necks out just because it is right thing. That is Stark MO.

actually i don't think the pw was a repaying of the debts of the rw and i don't think the book shows that at all. but the tv series implies it heavily through olenna's speech to sansa. i think that's what cyberia's referring to:

How did they? Because she did not TALK very much? It was precisely her nonverbal acting that makes people praise her, and that is the more difficult part where she could sparkle
2689	jons nissa	2014-04-14	hmmmmm. this was posted in the general section but i thought it would be apropos to post here given the assumption i've seen posted (and believed myself!) that the tyrells meant to frame tyrion and sansa.
Â 
Â 

I based it a little on the death of Eustace, the son of King Stephen of England. Stephen had usurped the crown from his cousin, the empress Maude, and they fought a long civil war and the anarchy and the war would be passed down to second generation, because Maude had a son and Henry and Stephen had a son. But Eustace choked to death at a feast. People are still debating a thousand of years later: Did he choke to death or was he poisoned? Because by removing Eustace, it brought about a peace that ended the English civil war. Eustaceâ<U+0080><U+0099>s death was accepted [as accidental], and I think thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s what the murderers here were hoping for â<U+0080><U+0094> the whole realm will see Joffrey choke to death on a piece of pie or something. But what they didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t count on, was Cerseiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s immediate assumption that this was murder. Cersei wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t fooled by this for a second. She doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t believe that it was an accidental death. You saw the scene filmed, does it come across as he could possibly be just choking or is it very clear heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s been poisoned?

it seems that grrm wanted the tyrells to believe they could create an "accidental" death and never meant for anyone to be framed. very interesting and makes me think i need to reconsider the tyrells.
2690	Colonel Green	2014-04-14	How did they? Because she did not TALK very much?


By consistently eliminating and/or minimizing her plot and character development?Â  The wedding, case in point.Â  Rather than being the culmination of her escape subplot, she just sits around, as lacking in agency as ever.

i don't know. it's impossible to think that given cersei screaming "murder". it also doesn't help that joffrey had just finished completely humiliating tyrion in a very public way which already had everyone on edge. there's no way the tyrells could have anticipated that.

She does precisely NOT just sit around, the actress shows everything, she is intensely immersed in every moment, transporting so much with a minimum of moves, her face a landscape. This is the contrary of "just sitting around" and I am pleased to realize that I so far have underestimated Sophie Turner.
2694	Colonel Green	2014-04-14	She does precisely NOT just sit around


Yes, she does.Â  She has no active role in the plot at all.Â  Sansa's scenes on this show for the past season plus all amount to either "look how sad she is as she sits around (and isn't it sad how this affects Tyrion?)" or "look how dumb she is" (at least we haven't had any of the latter this season, which is an addition by subtraction; now we're just at the point where the writers are deleting her material, rather than deleting her material and replacing it with crap).

Â 
in defense of loras, he was being directly mocked about something that is clearly well known and considered an embarrassment but yes, he could have borne it more gracefully.
2697	Dragon of Valyria	2014-04-14	The fact that Turner can do so much with so little is one of the reasons it's so annoying that the writers so consistently reduce Sansa to a background character.

This. Sophie Turner is so marvelous at what she does that it's annoying that they have her act so passively. Do much off hat she does is react to things, and while she does a great job of maintaining composure while being filled with emotional turmoil, it's something that can only be picked up by those paying attention. 
So much of her role in the books is introspection. That's not well-suited for the show, but you'd think they could make adjustments to account for it like they do with other aspects that don't exactly translate to the screen perfectly. Instead all they do is cut her plot line and rob her of any sort of agency at all. It's a misuse of an excellent character and a talented actress.

Â 
True... Although I need to see next week's episode to make definitive statements about Sansa's storyline in the beginning of Season 4. She never speaks too much, but she brings out emotions through the gazes, one-liners... For the first time, this was not about "just sitting" and actually had a point.
Â 
But, I think Colonel Green has a point. When you have actress this talented and who can bring a lot to the table, it is frustrating to see her being a piece of furniture, especially when the original material gives you space to use it.
Â 
And, as usual, we are glad to see you have seen the errors of your ways

Â 
True... Contrasting them showed Sansa's dignity, strength and endurance... And that is one of those things we missed to see for so long in TV...
2699	The Drunkard	2014-04-14	My favourite part of that episode was probably Sansa's reaction to the dwarf joust, and I haven't much enjoyed many of her scenes in the past.Â 
Â 
She was told that the hairnet would help her escape, yeah? It'd be nice if she was told the same about the necklace.
Â 


The series messed up, though.Â  The way they played it, Margeary really did seem to have control over Joffrey, even at the wedding.Â  Cersei's fears about that were justified.Â  In the series, it doesn't logically follow that they would want Joffrey dead.Â  They seemed to have control of the king.


Â 
I think the most control anyone could ever have over Joffrey would be dubious at best. By the end of the day Marg wasn't having an easy time 'soothing' him, he was making a fool of himself in front of everyone.

Joff was making a fool of himself but he wasn't hurting Margaery.Â  AndÂ Cersei'sÂ undermining notwithstanding, Margaery had exercised control over Joffrey by convincing him to give the leftover food to the poor.Â  As long as he wasn't hurting Margaery, and doing what she wants, why would they want him dead?
2703	VladimirDulud	2014-04-14	Wouldn't you much rather have a nice, functional king, rather than a giggling sociopath who required tons of maintenance on a daily basis?

I must needs agree.
Â 
Joff would have tortured Marge, mayhaps. And if not, he would have threatened to cross certain Tyrell niceties, as was on display at the wedding itself.
Â 
The Queen of Thorns would not have sat still for this.
2704	JesterX	2014-04-14	Wouldn't you much rather have a nice, functional king, rather than a giggling sociopath who required tons of maintenance on a daily basis?

Sure, but you know theÂ saying about "the devil you know. . ."Â  They have no certainty that Tywin would agree to marry Tommen to Margaery with Joffrey dead.

Â 
Well, the Tyrells are deriving a lot of their increased power and status from the king they've married, and shoring up his power shores up theirs by extension. They've recognized that and like you said donated food to the poor on Joffrey's behalf, and I believe in season 3 did other things to endear Joffrey to the commoners, but he's still coming across as a petty, destructive asshole all too often.
Â

2708	VladimirDulud	2014-04-14	This. Sophie Turner is so marvelous at what she does that it's annoying that they have her act so passively. Do much off hat she does is react to things, and while she does a great job of maintaining composure while being filled with emotional turmoil, it's something that can only be picked up by those paying attention.
So much of her role in the books is introspection. That's not well-suited for the show, but you'd think they could make adjustments to account for it like they do with other aspects that don't exactly translate to the screen perfectly. Instead all they do is cut her plot line and rob her of any sort of agency at all. It's a misuse of an excellent character and a talented actress.


Â 
I truly believe her passive position is simply a slowed down version of Dany's character arc and development.
Â 
She will eventually turn into a Littlefinger-tutored manipulator.
Â 
Except, instead of it happening over 1 book/season, it will run the course of the entire span of the series.

That would be fine if we saw any of it. We're four seasons in and we've gotten nothing like that. So when she does do the whole Alayne bit, her progress will seek like it came out of nowhere. In the books we're in her head -- we can see her digesting the lessons. 
Aside from the marvelous Blackwater, where we see her inner goodness and her rejection of Cersei's dark view of humanity, we rarely get in her head. We don't see her learning lessons. She has one convo with Sandor in the show where he says everybody is a better liar than her, and we see her (again, in Blackwater) manipulating Joffrey... but that's it. 
I wish they showed more if her growth, gave her a chance to shine. Hopefully with various characters dying off we'll have more time to spend with her as she develops at the Eyrie...

2710	JesterX	2014-04-14	Â 
Well, the Tyrells are deriving a lot of their increased power and status from the king they've married, and shoring up his power shores up theirs by extension. They've recognized that and like you said donated food to the poor on Joffrey's behalf, and I believe in season 3 did other things to endear Joffrey to the commoners, but he's still coming across as a petty, destructive asshole all too often.
Â 
Tommen's just a simpler solution, at least to me.


Â 
I think the show should have added a scene where Joff was particularly cruel to Margaery.Â  Then it would be more logical and more justified.
2711	JesterX	2014-04-14	Why wouldn't Tywin agree?Â  The logic is the same.


Â 
They have no idea how he would react to Joff dying.Â  Maybe he suspects them even if he can't prove itÂ  His intelligence is renowned over the 7 kingdoms.Â  It's just too many variables when you know in Joff you've already got a sure thing.Â  It's not perfect, but it'sÂ under control.Â  If they keep him that way long enough for Margaery to have a son, that's the way I would've went.Â
2712	channamasala	2014-04-14	How did they? Because she did not TALK very much? It was precisely her nonverbal acting that makes people praise her, and that is the more difficult part where she could sparkle


Â 
I get the point of it - if you thought the rest of your family was dead (and she does), and you were being held hostage and married into a family whom you hated and who would just as well you were dead now that the war's one and there's no one to ransom you to, you'd try to stay in the background too. Sansa is a background character now because her characterÂ wants to be.
Â 
Side question: we never get to see Olenna putting the poison in the wine, do we? Only her taking the gem. Right?
2713	Colonel Green	2014-04-14	Sansa is a background character now because her characterÂ wants to be.


That's nonsensical.Â  Sansa has a story going on here, and the show cut it.Â  She keeps her head low, but that doesn't mean the show itself should ignore her.

Â 
I don't think it's nonsensical at all. Maybe it is in your opinion, but I truly disagree. I feel like the story told in the books is being conveyed visually in ways the books couldn't - through her not only keeping her head low as in the books, but showing it as someone who is keeping her head low.
Â 
They did cut the Dontos storyline, but I see why they did it - it was readable in the books but in the TV show it would have both gotten confusing and made it far easier for viewers to guess that something was going to be up with her at the wedding (in the book, despite the Dontos storyline, I honestly had no idea stuff would hit the fan quite the way it did - but I feel that doing the same thing in the TV show would have had a much different effect).
Â 
I also think all this quiet acting through facial expressions is going to pay off when her storyline develops later...which I'm pretty sure GRRM said it would.
2716	channamasala	2014-04-14	Â 
I must needs agree.
Â 
Joff would have tortured Marge, mayhaps. And if not, he would have threatened to cross certain Tyrell niceties, as was on display at the wedding itself.
Â 
The Queen of Thorns would not have sat still for this.


Â 
I agree. I'm not sure Margaery was in on it (I don't remember if the books say so). I could see a young protege Margaery thinking she could control Joffrey indefinitely, but an older, more experienced Olenna knowing that that was likely not the case. I mean, Cersei thought she could control him too...
2717	Colonel Green	2014-04-14	but in the TV show it would have both gotten confusing


How?
Â 
The Dontos storyline is important for giving Sansa some agency and insuring she doesn't just sit around for two seasons (i.e., what actually happened on the show because they cut it).Â  It also has various thematic threads about Sansa's changing views on knighthood, etc., but the show has pretty much wholly jettisoned that stuff, between the loss of her interactions with both Dontos and the Hound.
2718	ohpooratlas	2014-04-14	The general reaction I've seen from unsullied viewers who have generally disliked Sansa has been remarkably positive for this episode. And I think that is in large part due to Sophie Turner's spectacular acting. I loved someone's comment from the last page about Sophie's face being a canvas. She conveys so much with only her eyes.
Â 
I am still a little bummed by the fact that they've removed Sansa's agency regarding her active role in her own escape, but I do not agree that she has been relegated to furniture. Her survival in King's Landing has been completely determined by her ability to internalize everything, to maintain her inner strength and grace.
Â 
Anyway. I think we can all agree that from this point on, Sansa will not be furniture. She's going to be sharing a very major subplot in the series from here on out, including a location that will predominantly focus on her and Littlefinger.
Â 
Regarding Margaery: I think by the end of Joffrey's little tirade, it became absolute clear that Margaery does not have the control over him that she initially thought. She keeps doing her best to pull him back, but the whole War of the 5 Kings debacle just kind of showed her increasing annoyance with him. That was Joffrey acting in front of everyone in the court. Imagine how he would have been behind closed doors. All it takes for Joffrey is one imagined slight.
Â 
Margaery is good but she's not that good, she's still learning ... as has been demonstrated by the QoT in the first episode of this season ... and from the glimpse we got in the preview for the next episode.
2719	Colonel Green	2014-04-14	Anyway. I think we can all agree that from this point on, Sansa will not be furniture.


That remains to be seen, given the writers' track record.Â  She could just as easily end up as Littlefinger's prop now that her stint as a prop for Tyrion and co. is done.
2720	TeamLemonCakeBraavos	2014-04-14	That's nonsensical.Â  Sansa has a story going on here, and the show cut it.Â  She keeps her head low, but that doesn't mean the show itself should ignore her.


Â 
I disagree with your analysis that they've made her character a background character. No one I've talked about the show with has ever considered her a 'pawn' to everyone else. They either love her or they hate her...but they do it based upon her character alone.
Â 
Also, that dwarf jousting scene (in the book) was solely meant as a humiliation of Tyrion. In the show, I felt they completely reversed that dynamic and made that scene about Sansa and HER pain and humiliation. A huge difference, I would say.
Â 
Alas, we're only two episodes in. Her character can and will continue to develop and be seen for what and who SHE is. I have confidence in that.

Â 
I personally felt the episodes leading up to the Red Wedding had so much going on in them that one more storyline would have sent the whole thing to poop. That's how. I also don't think the book handled the storyline allÂ that well, I felt like it got repetitive: oh my life sucks, I hate King's Landing now, I'm married to this dwarf, but Ser Dontos will save me! Oh my life sucks, I have a chance to escape now with Sandor, but I won't because Ser Dontos will save me!Â It actually didn't do that much for me, to be honest.
Â 
I do agree they took away her agency, and I don't like that, although if I'm going to complain about them ruining a character, it'll be Catelyn or Stannis, not Sansa. I feel that Sophie Turner is a good enough actress that although she got less agency and less storyline, her character wasn't diminished as much as the other two.
Â 
And yes, I do feel that with the whole "Dontos will save me" thing in the book, if tried on TV, would have given away far too easily that something was going to happen with the gems she was wearing (on her hairpiece, her necklace, whatever). A bunch of show-only watchers would've seen it coming - instead now they're all like 'who did it? OMG'. For that reason alone I see why they cut the storyline.

Have Margaery give her the necklace.Â  Problem solved.
2724	channamasala	2014-04-14	Actually, now that I'm thinking about it more (I just saw the episode - being in Taiwan I can't watch them when you all can) I'm not all that sure the show took away her agency.
Â 
In fact, I don't even think the book gave her that much more agency. She was still relying on someone else to take her away. She was still putting faith in the plans of others. Sure, she had a few choices, but did she really have more than in the TV show?
Â 
In the TV show, she was told right then and there she'd have to leave if she wanted to live. She technically had the choice to stay, and she seemed to be contemplating it (perhaps she'd finally come to care enough about Tyrion - if not love him exactly - that she hesitated)? Instead she was faced with a very immediate decision and although the show did not reveal it, we all know what choice she made. An immediate decision under stressful, confusing circumstances, in my view, gave her enough agency that I'm not mad about the change in storyline.
Â 
Waiting for a promised rescue at an appointed time (the timing of which would have immediately tipped watchers of the show off that they should keep their eyes on Sansa) that someone else engineered vs. being presented with an immediate "now or never" opportunityÂ justÂ as she's begun to show some caring for her husband? That takes some daring, too.
I'd say the change in agency, while I get what you're saying, is not that huge if it's there at all.

2726	Colonel Green	2014-04-14	That still would have left one extra storyline


It's Sansa's storyline, not something you cut for time.Â  Keep it and cut the nonsense comic relief scenes they stuck her with last year that did nothing but maker her look stupid.Â  Or the pointless brothel scenes. Or the made-up scenes for side-characters who aren't nearly as important as she is to the series' endgame.
Â 


Sure, she had a few choices, but did she really have more than in the TV show?


Yes.Â  In the books she made the choice to investigate what could have been a trap, and then had to levelheadedly assess whether Dontos could be trusted, and risk her safety repeatedly in meeting with him.Â  In the show Dontos ambushes her in the midst of a chaotic scene and she has no time to decide anything meaningfully.

re: Colonel Green:Well then she'll be the most expensive and important furniture in the room while Littlefinger spends all of his screen time monologuing.Â  


Â 
The problem of "being the furniture" began when in Season III, where Sansa more or less was just a window to the characters. They equalized her and Tyrion's torments, retrograded her character with some stupid lines, and episode 3.10 gave more time to Tyrion to mourn the Starks than Sansa and Arya combined. That made huge leap this year and we only have 2 episodes. In these two episodes, even without that much to say, they showed more of Sansa than in entire last season.Â 
Â 
Â 


Â 
I personally felt the episodes leading up to the Red Wedding had so much going on in them that one more storyline would have sent the whole thing to poop. That's how. I also don't think the book handled the storyline allÂ thatÂ well, I felt like it got repetitive:Â oh my life sucks, I hate King's Landing now, I'm married to this dwarf, but Ser Dontos will save me! Oh my life sucks, I have a chance to escape now with Sandor, but I won't because Ser Dontos will save me!Â It actually didn't do that much for me, to be honest.


Â 
The episodes prior to RW, IMO, from episode 3.05 to 3.08 are among the worst in the series, especially when we discuss Sansa. The book wasn't repetitive given the fact that in each of Sansa's chapter, we had her facing a new blow. So, while I think for many Sansa\s chapters in ACOK/ASOS are a bit boring, they contain powerful development of someone who is forcefully made to grow up. The show could have handled Sansa's story much better, they even didn't need more time. It was all about quality writing not quantity of it.
Â 
I do agree they took away her agency, and I don't like that, although if I'm going to complain about them ruining a character, it'll be Catelyn or Stannis, not Sansa. I feel that Sophie Turner is a good enough actress that although she got less agency and less storyline, her character wasn't diminished as much as the other two.
Â 
Â 
I won't argue with that. Catelyn and Stannis are literally the two characters who were ruined to a point where you don't know whether they have actually read the books. As for Turner, she was always one of the best things about TV Sansa. She was never the problem and I find her as Sansa rather interesting, but the writing for her sometimes is so bad.
Â 
Â 


Actually, now that I'm thinking about it more (I just saw the episode - being in Taiwan I can't watch them when you all can) I'm not all that sure the show took away her agency.

Â 
The difference is that in books, she has agency and we see her for 2 books making plans to escape. She goes to Godswood with that desire, and while she has to put her faith in Dontos, that is a proactive role she had in her escape. She simply trusted someone, because her hands were tied and she couldn't have escaped alone even if she tried. As in TV show, in season III, there is almost like a break-up in her thoughts about home. And as this episode shows us, her escape is basically, what? Fortune? Dontos whisked her away, right... The small differences here matter and they are the devil... So, while on first look it may be nothing, in terms of agency, those differences are everything.
2728	VladimirDulud	2014-04-14	I think the first episode of this season is the first that instills some sense of empathy for Sansa.
Â 
She did start out as a cruel, spoiled child when audiences first meet her. I wouldn't say she was a hit to begin with.
Â 
Because the scene with Dontos allows her some grace, I do agree that seeing more of her character - kindness, gentility - more of her perspectives, beliefs, etc. - would benefit.Â 
Â 
There is something about Turner's manner and delivery that makes me see her as a bit spoiled and not having learned much in the way of humility, even though the character has been through quite a lot. Episode one this season may have changed that.
2729	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-14	Sansa fans, just one tiny little question. That weird eye-roll during the wedding ("We have a new queen"), why was that about? Didn't she always get along with Margaery in the show as well?
2730	PhoenixFlame	2014-04-14	I assumed it was because she disliked Cersei, somewhat like the Red Viper's takedown of the "former queen regent." Plus, Margaery going to be Joffrey's queen, meaning, in Sansa's mind, it's going to be pretty unhappy for Margaery regardless of her title.Â

They did get along rather well but I think the weird eye-roll was supposed to mean that the Mother of Madness (a.k.a. Brotherfucker, the artist formerly known as Cersei) finally lost her power, now that Margaery is queen, and she will finally leave her alone. At least that's what I think Sansa meant.
Â 
Now, since some of you argue on the reasons why QoT and LF killed Joffrey, let me explain. Olenna (and Mace probably) really wanted for Margaery to be THE queen and for that they didn't exactly need Joffrey since there was also Tomen around. Also, the Tyrells knew what kind of monster Joffrey was even before Sansa's confession because Baelysh told them. They were also aware of the fact that Joffrey would eventually start to abuse Margaery. If Loras would find out about the future potential abuse, he most definitely would've killed Joffrey. And that wasn't exactly good news since book Loras was already KG at that time.
Â 
So QoT and LF decided to eliminate Joffrey from the picture to fulfill both goals: avoiding the "birth" of a Tyrell kingslayer andÂ  Margaery still becomes Queen.

I think it was still very clear to viewers that the dwarf scene was aimed primarily at Tyrion however it was so distasteful and ill-judged that it offended numerous people.

I'm glad you guys found that scene distasteful as well. I immediately noticed how the big players at the wedding (the four Tyrells - Marg, QoT, Loras and Mace - , Sansa and Tyrion, Oberyn, Varys and surprisingly Tywin) were not exactly amused by Joffrey's little "history" lesson since they kind of forgot to laugh.Â
2737	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-14	Sansa would have been accused and tried alongside Tyrion, not free for remarriage.


Â 
Cersei would have wanted to, sure, but Tywin wouldn't have allowed it, since Sansa was the key to the North. Plus, if the Tyrells had openly asked for her to marry Willas, Tywin would have likely accepted because he was determined not to refuse them anything they asked.
Â 
So I guess they would have probably said Tyrion forced Sansa to carry the poison and that she didn't have any choice, etc

Compared with her actual comments in the book about what a lovely ceremony it was, it jarred. I suspect it was a way of incorporating some of her disillusionment about KL that has been missed in previous seasons such as her noting the same crowd that tried to kill her welcomed Marg into the city with open arms. But who knows.
ST was fantastic in this episode, and it is such a shame her storyline has been cut up to this point. Hopefully now that she is not in KL her scenes will get better. 
There were a lot of filler scenes in this episode (Olenna and Tywin for example) that could have been swapped with a short scene of Sansa meeting Dontos before the Wedding, for him to propose an escape. It would have been nice to see her as an active participant in her own escape as she was in the books, but at least her scenes will no longer be hampered by the focus having to be on St Tyrion.

2744	Le Cygne	2014-04-14	It would have been nice to see her as an active participant in her own escape as she was in the books, but at least her scenes will no longer be hampered by the focus having to be on St Tyrion.I bet it will continue from a distance, whoever wrote the viewer's guide, while making sure to take the name Sansa Stark from her, neglected to mention she was forcibly married, and felt that was a very important point to make the point that Tyrion always treated her with the utmost respect. She doesn't even star in her own bio.
2745	Lord Damian	2014-04-14	At the same time Olenna takes the stone from Sansa's necklace, listen to what she's saying.Â  She's condemning Lannister actions at the Red Wedding, implying Joffery since he claims credit for winning the war, and subtly calling him a monster for killing a man at a wedding.Â  Notice she also implies herself with this line, albeit a more graceful and wise monster.Â  And as Tyrion says: Monsters are Dangerous.
Â 
But the conversation about the RW also reveals Olenna's motive for involving Sansa at all: Justice.Â  Olenna likes Sansa and thinks that what was done to her family was a crime.Â  She also knows Sansa is not in any position to seek any redress of this.Â  So, planning on killing Joffery anyway, she arranges to have the instrument of Joffery's death be borne by the last of the Stark family.Â  That Sansa knew nothing was simply done to protect her, but still...Â  The Starks send their regarrrrrrds.
Â 
Olenna put on a show of "this is how you wield power."Â  Joffery is dead.Â  Margery is the queen, or at least has a claim the Lannisters can't ignore.Â  The Starks got some justice.Â  Dontos isn't the type the Lannisters/Joffery would be monitoring, and he and Sansa are entering Witness Protection.Â  No one suspects the Tyrells at all despite the fact that she did it in front of ALL the Lannisters, the Kingsguard and all the Lords of the Realm.Â 
Â 
Well Played Lady Olenna


Justice, I can see that to a point. She does mention when first meeting Sansa that she knew her grandfather Rickard and that Ned had been known for being "honorable". I think Lady Oleana was still hoping to get Sansa to marry Ser Loras on the tv show and in the books to Willas. Sansa is the last known living Stark and heir to the North. They all want her claim, in the books and on HBO. (yes, that includes EVERYONE).

Ouch. Clearly not written by anyone who had read the book and her near rape at the hands of Tyrion then.

2748	Rapsie	2014-04-14	Well, since the viewer's guide is based on show canon and not book canon, that's hardly surprising, is it? 

No not really.
2749	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-14	As much as I admire Sansa's strength and trials throughout the books, Sophie Turner's portrayal is what actually brought me around to liking the character. That might be blasphemy for some Sansa fans, but whatever. She's been fantastic in both episodes this season so far; looking forward to her time in the Eyrie. I wonder if we'll get the Winterfell scene?
2750	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-14	Thing is, Tywin believes Tyrion did it, and would probably have believed the same of Sansa.Â  Moreover, a public accusation of the sort Cersei made would be hard to get around, given the circumstances, even if he didn't.Â  This is especially true given that, if she had actually been arrested, the poison would have quite possibly been uncovered.


Â 
Well, yeah, but Tywin really had no use for Tyrion. Killing Sansa, on the other hand, could have easily re-ignited the war with the North. Tywin's nothing if not practical, after all.
2751	Le Cygne	2014-04-14	There was nothing respectful about keeping her hostage after his family murdered her father, and she was at the mercy of Joffrey, they all knew this was going on, or could have known, or waging war against her brother, or forcibly marrying her, and as the scene with Shae showed, she narrowly escaped rape, just by being in that situation, she was very likely to be raped by him or by another Lannister in the not too distant future, he did what daddy said, and daddy was pretty ruthless and not with endless patience. Her life as she knew it, all her hopes and dreams, were shattered. And now she's in the midst of a regicide plot. I don't think the term the utmost respect can be used in a situation like this, under any circumstances.

All of your reasons above are ample explanation of why he didn't treat her well. Yet the show has chosen to run with the bodice ripper trope of forced marriage to an enemy being really what you needed all along and forget your own decisions and dreams because they are clearly going to be stupid.
2753	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-14	There was nothing respectful about keeping her hostage after his family murdered her father, and she was at the mercy of Joffrey, they all knew this was going on, or could have known, or waging war against her brother, or forcibly marrying her, and as the scene with Shae showed, she narrowly escaped rape, just by being in that situation, she was very likely to be raped by him or by another Lannister in the not too distant future, he did what daddy said, and daddy was pretty ruthless and not with endless patience.

Â 
That's why I love Olenna more for framing that fucker. Sansa would have been 1000000x times happier with Willas, I bet
2754	Raksha 2014	2014-04-14	The general reaction I've seen from unsullied viewers who have generally disliked Sansa has been remarkably positive for this episode. And I think that is in large part due to Sophie Turner's spectacular acting. I loved someone's comment from the last page about Sophie's face being a canvas. She conveys so much with only her eyes.
Â 
I am still a little bummed by the fact that they've removed Sansa's agency regarding her active role in her own escape, but I do not agree that she has been relegated to furniture. Her survival in King's Landing has been completely determined by her ability to internalize everything, to maintain her inner strength and grace.
Â 
Anyway. I think we can all agree that from this point on, Sansa will not be furniture. She's going to be sharing a very major subplot in the series from here on out, including a location that will predominantly focus on her and Littlefinger.
Â 
Regarding Margaery: I think by the end of Joffrey's little tirade, it became absolute clear that Margaery does not have the control over him that she initially thought. She keeps doing her best to pull him back, but the whole War of the 5 Kings debacle just kind of showed her increasing annoyance with him. That was Joffrey acting in front of everyone in the court. Imagine how he would have been behind closed doors. All it takes for Joffrey is one imagined slight.
Â 
Margaery is good but she's not that good, she's still learning ... as has been demonstrated by the QoT in the first episode of this season ... and from the glimpse we got in the preview for the next episode.


Â 
Â 
It would have been marvelous, and fairly easy to do, to have Dontos set up, in one conversation with Sansa, an escape during the wedding, so at least she could have been seen to participating in the attempt to gain her freedom. Â 
Â 
Margaery might have thought at one point that she could control the little monster of a king, and initially (last season) it was shown that she could influence him. Â But it's one thing to influence a teenaged boy who's impressed by a sophisticated older woman and another thing entirely to continue that influence as the teenaged boy grows up into the most powerful man in Westeros, especially if he's a vicious sociopath who gets sexually aroused by hurting people and animals (as in the shows). Â Margaery would have ended up with bruises and welts at the least; though Joffrey might have abstained from more severe injuries (or killing her) if she gave him a son or two. Â I think the Queen of Thorns, who was older and wiser than Margaery, and knew how a husband's attitude could change over time, figured out very quickly that Joffrey would have to be killed in order for Margaery to remain safe as a nominal Baratheon queen.

Â 
I don't fault the Tyrells for that.Â  Arranged political marriage usually are mutually beneficial, and the Starks weren't being shafted.Â  Sansa would get her fairytale marriage/life and be safe.
Â 
Remember she's a girl....no matter who she marries, the Stark line ends with her (so far as anyone knows).Â  Winterfell WILL pass to another family.Â  Period.Â  No matter what.
Â 
So what family should get the Keys to the North?Â  The Lannisters or the Tyrells?
2756	SweetJeyne	2014-04-14	The series messed up, though.Â  The way they played it, Margeary really did seem to have control over Joffrey, even at the wedding.Â  Cersei's fears about that were justified.Â  In the series, it doesn't logically follow that they would want Joffrey dead.Â  They seemed to have control of the king.


Totally agree. The Tyrells are taking an enormous risk, and it makes much less sense if we don't see Margaery under threat.

Just like the Stark line ended when Bael the Bard fathered a lord of Winterfell? We've seen family names pass through the female line before.
2758	ebevan91	2014-04-14	Sophie Turner is doing such a great job this season! Â I'm so excited to see her arc with LF.


Sansa's chapters post-royal wedding were amazing. Such a bummer we didn't get any of her in A Dance with Dragons.
2759	Spotted Cat	2014-04-14	I did like Sophie Turner's reactions to the jousts. Living hell, anyone ?
Â 
In any case "come with me if you want to live" - the Dontonator ? Â Â  


i think the whole reaction was very well done, the queens (both of them) and loras tooÂ
2760	Colonel Green	2014-04-14	Well, yeah, but Tywin really had no use for Tyrion. Killing Sansa, on the other hand, could have easily re-ignited the war with the North. Tywin's nothing if not practical, after all.


There is no way Tywin would have allowed Sansa to live if he thought she had committed regicide.
2761	channamasala	2014-04-14	Totally agree. The Tyrells are taking an enormous risk, and it makes much less sense if we don't see Margaery under threat.


Â 
Actually, I felt that at the wedding, she had some control - she is very good at basic graces like turning situations around, distracting people, making people feel good (she probably would have made a pretty good queen in fact, conniving and scheming aside seeing as everyone does that anyway) but she was clearly worried about losing it as Joffrey acted out. She knew when to stay silent and wait for an opening to distract people, true, but she sure looked worried in some of those scenes.
Â 
So generally I agree, and Cersei's fears are quite founded, but I do feel like even Margaery worried about losing control of Joffrey at the wedding itself.
2762	channamasala	2014-04-14	There is no way Tywin would have allowed Sansa to live if he thought she had committed regicide.


Â 
I agree with this.Â 
Â 
Also, re-ignited the war...with whom? There are still a lot of Stark loyalists but without banners to rally around, I don't see that as a major threat. Had Sansa stayed in King's Landing she'd either be dead or in very real danger of it.
2763	channamasala	2014-04-14	I assumed it was because she disliked Cersei, somewhat like the Red Viper's takedown of the "former queen regent." Plus, Margaery going to be Joffrey's queen, meaning, in Sansa's mind, it's going to be pretty unhappy for Margaery regardless of her title.Â 


Â 
I agree with this. I don't think Sansa's eyeroll was an attack on Margaery but a very smart acknowledgement of how things are with kings and queens in her world. If anything, I felt this gave her back a tiny bit of agency.
Â 
To go back to the above, I'm sorry, but IÂ did feel that the Dontos storyline in the book got repetitive. I just wasn't feeling it - whatever GRRM was trying to do with the "deconstruction of the romantic fantasy trope" worked in other parts of her story but not that particular thread. At least for me. I just didn't really miss it being gone from the TV show, although after Book 1 I was one of the few people who liked Sansa, having sensed (correctly, I think) that her character was going to end up on a sympathetic arc the way Jaime's did.
Â 
The Sansa storyline I wish they'd shown more of was the Sansa/Margaery one. Going in depth about what it means to be a noblewoman with few real friends, then making what she thinks is a real friend about her age, and then quickly losing that "friend" (although I don't think Sansa ever came to dislike Margaery) was a storyline I found fascinating and not repetitive or dull the way I found the "Dontos will save me!" one. They shouldn't have reduced it to a few quick scenes.
Â 
But then I still feel like Turner's acting - her face, her short comments, her little actions - give her a quiet agency that I felt was, if anything, missing from the books.
Â 
I'm not saying y'all are "wrong" that they took away her agency when they changed the Dontos storyline, just that I see it very differently.
Â 
Of all the characters, I'm the most excited to see what happens in future books and seasons with Sansa and Arya (I like Arya and the Hound as a combo but was getting sick of them roving around Westeros - it's time for a change). That - and this is unrelated to this thread, I'm just thinking "out loud" - I may be the only person who is in fact fascinated with Essos and I would not only like to see Danaerys go to Asshai, I'm curious about Yi Ti! I don't think we'll ever get to see Sothoryos (that's what it's called, right?) though. But I'm a long-term expat who has spent years traveling around Asia - of course I'd be interested in seeing that Parallel-Universe Asia.

Â 
Well Played Lady Olenna


I didn't see it that way. I saw it as Olenna trying to earn her trust so she goes to Highgarden, they kill Tyrion if he still lives and they marry her for her claim as they've wanted to do all along.
Â 
Too bad Olenna was culprit though. The first time I've watched I seriously wondered if the showrunners were leaving option of Sansa executing Joffrey as it befits to a Stark of Winterfell (and maybe that crackpot theory someone posted in the books forums about Sansa being the killer in the books as well had a hint of true). What a pity...
2765	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-14	Â

Â 
With the North, of course. The only reason they kind of settled down (or at least pretended to) was because of Ramsey's so-called marriage with a "Stark" girl. And even then several houses remained hostile: the Glovers, the Mormonts, some of the Umbers, the mountain clans, the Manderlys, at least in secret, etc. As soon as Theon got Jeyne out, the others started to make things difficult for Roose.
Â 
I do agree that it would be a tough call for Tywin, though. I'd like to believe his pragmatism to hold the North and to keep the Tyrells happy would win in the end.
2766	Elaena Targaryen	2014-04-14	Sansa fans, just one tiny little question. That weird eye-roll during the wedding ("We have a new queen"), why was that about? Didn't she always get along with Margaery in the show as well?


Â 
For such a smallÂ moment I stillÂ think it served a few things, different from what others have said, and I feel Martin added it for a reason.Â It's Tyrion's comment I feel that shows what Sansa's eye rolling thing was for, as he says "better her than you" and maybe it's his comment that shows the reason.
Â 
At first glanceÂ I think it shows Sansa's last little bit of jealously over not being THE queen,Â as she wasÂ raised to be, and spent her whole life wanting to be, to be loved by all, to have her prince.Â So it's a nice character reminder moment, showing the last remnantsÂ of she's still just a normal girl, with a normal reaction, when faced with an unattainable dream...Â albeitÂ undesirable at this point.
Â 
But the more important part for me is the reminder that Sansa was supposed to be THE queen and have it all, so when she naturally experiences this last pang of envyÂ who is the one to remind her to let the remnant go since it is clearly "better her than you"? Sansa's vile little dwarf husband, that she will never want touching her, so it begs the question "is it better me than him"? Only because Tyrion does not appear sadistic... and that's about it, not to mentionÂ her loss of the pompÂ of position.
Â 
I feel this simple, quick, eye rolling moment serves to remind us dreamilyÂ of what a wondrous life Sansa could have had, what she thought it could be -Â to remind us of realisticallyÂ what a horrific life Sansa would have had, and the horrors she has alreadyÂ faced -Â to remind us of the pathetic life Sansa has been forced to live, and does she have to accept this to be 'as good as it gets'?
Â 
It hopefully should set up nicely what's to come with the changes in her character, and the changes for her character,Â once she is free to let it all go andÂ free fromÂ all of that baggage.
Â 
I know that's a lot to pack into a simple moment in a show but I cannot helpÂ thatÂ that the books influence me,Â and you will have to forgive me if I did not convey my thoughts properly as clear expression when writing eludes me.

Â 
That makes sense (and you conveyed your thoughts excellentlyÂ   ) and you're right, it's a nice little moment, especially because it contrasts what season 1 Sansa thought being queen meant and what season 4 Sansa (and Tyrion) really knows it entails.
Â 
My original interpretation was that Sansa was just resigned to her fate and thought everything would remain the same for her even with a new queen, but then I remembered their little bonding moment last season when Margaery was telling Sansa all the good things about Tyrion and found the eye-roll a bit weird, but now that you mention it I can see a bit of a sarcastic "hope you're happy Margaery, congrats"
2768	joachim	2014-04-15	I think people are missing the point when they talk about Sansa and agency. In the book, she wants to escape and go home. In the show, forget about escape, she doesn't want to go on living.

How is that missing the point?Â  They changed the story to remove her plan of escape, hence she's got nothing to look forward to.Â  That was a deliberate choice, which has removed her agency.
2770	lil_z	2014-04-15	This is a very detailed look at stills from the episode that goes over the squence of events. That make the most sense in my eyes.

I looked through the previous posts to be sure this wasn't posted yet, but I am human if that's wrong

Â 
Up until seeing that I was mystified about how the Qot managed to make it from the necklace to the kings cup without notice. But it all fits particularlly the conversations with Margaery and Qot in season 3, starting with Sansa's admission, professing Joffery's cruelty. It certainly makes sense that the wedding feast was sort of an open display of the disgust held by the Tyrells for Joffery. And this being Game of Thrones, it makes sense on that front as well, Tyrells commit regicide to achieve greater power and remove a cruel tyrannt in the making. It was a master stroke of luck I believe that rather than complete mystery surrounding Joffery's death, that the blame fell squarly on Tyrion and Sansa. I highly doubt that Tyrion and Sansa where the actually targets of suspicion...easy to blame a nameless assasign, or hapless servant.
2771	Annara Snow	2014-04-15	I bet it will continue from a distance, whoever wrote the viewer's guide, while making sure to take the name Sansa Stark from her, neglected to mention she was forcibly married, and felt that was a very important point to make the point that Tyrion always treated her with the utmost respect. She doesn't even star in her own bio.

Â 
Um, no? Unless I've missed something, her marriage was forced in the show, too.
Â 
And I would hardly call not raping someone "treating with utmost respect".
Â 
Also, has it really been established in the show that she is called "Sansa Lannister" now? I thought that was just the stupid Viewer's Guide.
Â 


But Le Cygne, it is St Tyrion and he can do no wrong......
All of your reasons above are ample explanation of why he didn't treat her well. Yet the show has chosen to run with the bodice ripper trope of forced marriage to an enemy being really what you needed all along and forget your own decisions and dreams because they are clearly going to be stupid.

They've showed that the forced marriage to Tyrion is what she really needed all along?

2772	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-04-15	Ive not read the thread so donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know what has been said, but what I really enjoyed about Sansa this episode was just how close to her book counterpart she was.
Just stoney faced silence. I like how in the book Tyrion says something about â<U+0080>If anything, her grief only made her more beautifulâ<U+0080><U+0099> and in the show, maybe because ST is getting older, she is actually more beautiful than ever.
I felt like I could feel her inner monologue, even though the PW is Tyrions chapter. Great stuff from a Sansa POV.
I was a bit disappointed the Dontonator just turned up and said â<U+0080>Come with me if you want to liveâ<U+0080><U+0099> though. Still, better than nothing.
I cant remember in the book, did she help Tyrion pick up the cup? Small detail.

Going in depth about what it means to be a noblewoman with few real friends, then making what she thinks is a real friend about her age, and then quickly losing that "friend" (although I don't think Sansa ever came to dislike Margaery) was a storyline I found fascinating and not repetitive or dull the way I found the "Dontos will save me!" one. They shouldn't have reduced it to a few quick scenes.
Â 
But then I still feel like Turner's acting - her face, her short comments, her little actions - give her a quiet agency that I felt was, if anything, missing from the books.
Â 
I'm not saying y'all are "wrong" that they took away her agency when they changed the Dontos storyline, just that I see it very differently.
Â 
Of all the characters, I'm the most excited to see what happens in future books and seasons with Sansa and Arya (I like Arya and the Hound as a combo but was getting sick of them roving around Westeros - it's time for a change). That - and this is unrelated to this thread, I'm just thinking "out loud" - I may be the only person who is in fact fascinated with Essos and I would not only like to see Danaerys go to Asshai, I'm curious about Yi Ti! I don't think we'll ever get to see Sothoryos (that's what it's called, right?) though. But I'm a long-term expat who has spent years traveling around Asia - of course I'd be interested in seeing that Parallel-Universe Asia.I very much agree with you (except that I was one of those who found little Sansa ridiculous and boring). But Sophie Turner has given the character of Sansa more agency with her subtle play than this somewhat childish Dontos-Florian story ever could. That part was ridiculous and not more than an illusion sold as "agency", to fool little Sansa, while in the show Sansa has dignity and strength  in dealing with her situation. She makes her viewpoint clear, towards Tyrion and  even in extreme danger and distress at Joffrey's provocations - one wrong move could get her and Tyrion killed - and yet she is very much there, the actress uses a minimum of actions to be very  active and tense. While book Sansa at that point of the story seems to be caught in some foggy minor parallel universe.
And you are for sure not the only one who is fascinated by Essos. I as well would like to see more of Martin's world.

Partly a joking response to Le Cygne, however there is a parallel to bodice ripper type novels. In deed rather than even slightly focus on how Tyrion broke his word or having her disinherited due to the marriage or the chances she'd be killed off, the TV show had Marg basically telling her she was a lucky girl and her and Tyrion chatting as friends after the wedding, when they could have focused on the fact that the was her captor.

I don't fault the Tyrells for that.Â  Arranged political marriage usually are mutually beneficial, and the Starks weren't being shafted.Â  Sansa would get her fairytale marriage/life and be safe.
Â 
Remember she's a girl....no matter who she marries, the Stark line ends with her (so far as anyone knows).Â  Winterfell WILL pass to another family.Â  Period.Â  No matter what.
Â 
So what family should get the Keys to the North?Â  The Lannisters or the Tyrells?


Â 
Not true. Â Maege Mormont bears the name Mormont, and as do all five of her daughters. Â I am positive that the Northerners would let Sansa and her children bear the Stark name if it'd keep their liege lords name alive.

Notice the missing gemstone from the necklace that Sir Dontos gave her after Olena Tyrell tells Sansa that she's sorry for what happens to Robb.

Watch her hand when that scene plays, and it looks like she's taking something from the necklace. The angle makes it hard to tell definitely, but it's pretty suspect.

Â 
And Joffrey is described as 'Joffrey, of the houses Lannister and Baratheon' so Sansa's hypothetical Lannister/Stark child would be 'Name, of the houses Lannister and Stark'.
Â 
I'm not completed sure, but I always thought the house name wasn't neccessarily like a surname the way we think of one.

Â 
Um, no? Unless I've missed something, her marriage was forced in the show, too.
Â 
And I would hardly call not raping someone "treating with utmost respect".
Â 
Also, has it really been established in the show that she is called "Sansa Lannister" now? I thought that was just the stupid Viewer's Guide.
Â 
Â 
They've showed that the forced marriage to Tyrion is what she really needed all along?

My point was that one could hardly expect the author of the HBO viewers' guide to have read the books and write a TV viewers' guide informed by book canon. I personally would not want someone writing a show guide who had read the books, lest things get hopelessly muddled, just as the showrunners apparently frown on the actors reading the books. 
Besides, the display of outrage here over the viewers' guide, amusing as it is, completely ignores the fact that in the WOIAF app, which IS based in book canon, Sansa and Tyrion's entries are also glowing when it comes to his treatment of Sansa. Sansa's entry states that Tyrion "tries to treat her kindly," although he's kept busy with his duties, and Tyrion's entry states that Tyrion is "solicitous towards his new bride" or similar. The near rape is reduced merely to Tyrion's promise to Sansa that he won't consummate the marriage until she wishes him to do so. So if you're going to gnash your teeth and rend your garments over whitewashing Tyrion in official materials over book canon, you'd be best advised to start there, rather than whining about the fact that a TV viewers' guide is not based on the books.

Well said. This episode saw Sansa acting more like the character from the books than all of Season 3.
Â If you're referring to the ceremony, that's because she's tense because she's planning to escape.
Â 
The idea that her picking up a cup is somehow more agency than her planning to escape is bizarre.

Indeed. Picking up the cup is in character as Sansa is nice even to her enemies (see Lancel at the B of BW), however going armed with a knife to the Godswood, meeting repeatedly with Dontos, fooling Tyrion about this, smuggling clothes to the Godswood etc would have shown her to be a much more active participant in her own escape and show that it wasn't out if immediate necessity that she leaves, but because she is desperate to get away from KL and the Lannisters.

Â 
These are the reasons I was surprised to hear the PW was going to be in Ep2. I thought 4 or perhaps 3 was going to be more likely.Â 
Â 
I'll be prepared to forgive them for S3 if they show a dramatic character change in her from here on in. Arya, Bran and Jon have all had sudden turns this season thus far. It would make sense for for all the Starks and especially Sansa to make a much stronger showing now that Joff is dead and the Lannisters are in disarray.
2783	Annara Snow	2014-04-15	Partly a joking response to Le Cygne, however there is a parallel to bodice ripper type novels.

Â 
To be fair, a lot of the book readers say similar things, so I'm not sure if that's really reflective of the show's treatment of the storyline, or just the mind-bogglingly sexist attitudes of the fans. Not a month goes by without someone starting a "Why wasn't Sansa nicer to Tyrion"/"Are Sansa and Tyrion going to end up together" thread in the book forums.
Â 
Also, whether Tyrion was chatting to her amicably (and he was trying to in the book, too, but she was not having it) or not, the fact that she is a hostage/prisoner who has been forced into marriage still remains. Whether Sansa chose to chat with Tyrion or to be cold, she is still forced into marriage and has no choice at all in the matter. With all the whitewashing and watering down of this, it's still a fact.
Â 
And, to be fair, to accept this idea, one would have to assume that Margaery is the ultimate authority on healthy relationships and the appropriate behavior of women, rather than a power-grabbing opportunist who's bullshitting to Sansa because her family is allied with the Lannisters, who doesn't care who she's marrying as long as they have the title of king, and who has previously offered her gay husband a threesome with her own brother/his lover in order to conceive a baby for political reasons. Now, which one of these does show!Margaery seem to be?

My point is that you don't need to read the book to know that Sansa was a captive of the Lannisters and was forced into her marriage with Tyrion, or that she wasn't a happy bride/wife.

Â 
I don't know, I haven't even read any of these apps (since I can't install it) or viewer's guides (since I don't need it and don't care to read something that calls Sansa "Sansa Lannister" and Cersei "Cersei Baratheon"). I'm just reacting to the idea that it would be normal for a show-based guide/app to describe Sansa's marriage as not-forced, or the (bitter and sarcastic) idea that the show is promoting the Tyrion/Sansa marriage as something that Sansa "needed all along". For all the watering down of Sansa's wedding scenes in the show, one would have to have a very weird mindset to conclude that.
Â 
I mean, Tyrion doesn't grope Sansa, let her get naked or show her his erect dick on the show, so this means that she should be happy that she's been forced by her captors to get married to him?Â  Isn't that basically the same mindset that some book readers use when they're claiming that Sansa should have felt lucky to be married to Tyrion since he didn't rape or beat her? She shouldn't have felt lucky even if he was the greatest guy in the world.
Â 
I just don't accept the idea "well, the marriage looked bad in the books, but in the show it's presented as wonderful for Sansa". It's not, no matter how much nicer Tyrion is on the show or how much Margaery gets to bullshit to Sansa that she should just feel lucky she's been forced to marry him.
Â 
ETA: Personally, I think Margaery's "advice" seems as useful and wise as any of Cersei's "advice"Â  to Sansa. As usual, the only difference between those two is that Margaery is able to actually sell more people on her bullshit.

Okay.
Â 
I really, really would like it if those of us on two sides of this debate could be a little respectful of the fact that people have opinions.
Â 
"The idea that...is bizarre" - NO, it's an opinion.Â People get to have those.
Â 
Or is this a forum where it's okay to call other people's opinions - not facts, but opinions - "bizarre", "nonsensical", "missing the point"? To accomplish what, exactly?
Â 
All that doesn't change the fact that a few folks don't think the book's Dontos/Sansa storyline gave Sansa much agency either, or that some think Sophie showed Sansa's agency in other ways etc. etc..Â 
Â 
I can't speak for others, but just because I (and a few others I've read in this thread) don't think cutting this (repetitive and silly -Â in my opinion) storyline was a big deal, or that it was made up for in other ways, doesn't mean I think disagreeing opinions are "bizarre" or "nonsensical". It's okay either way. Whatever you think is cool. I just don't agree.
Â 
It's great to debate that while respecting that not everyone has the same reactions to these literary and visual art forms we're discussing but that doesn't mean different reactions are "bizarre" or "nonsensical".
Â 
So it'd be nice if that could go both ways.

What would give her agency is being involved in her own escape.Â  You're comparing Sansa tinging her attempts to escape with romantic notions with a slew of scenes that served no purpose other than to make Sansa the butt of a joke about how dumb she is.Â  Sansa was quite aware in the books that Dontos was a rather sorry sort, but he was her only friend, and she had to hope that he would serve.Â  She was not "lured away with children's stories" in the book.Â  Moreover, Dontos was the one who was really pushing the "Florian and Jonquil" stuff, and in any event, they could easily have downplayed or omitted that while preserving the core of the story.
Â 
The show and book have presented us with two different stories:
Â 
1)Â  Sansa receives a message to go the Godswood if she wants to go home.Â  Fearing a trap, she nevertheless takes the risk of investigating, and on discovering that it's Ser Dontos, ultimately she decides to go with him.Â  Her attitude towards Dontos is a mix of recognition that he's not a terribly impressive individual, gratitude that he's trying to help at all, and her old romantic hopes that she's found a hero after all.Â  She subsequently becomes frustrated with the seeming lack of progress.Â  Ultimately, they escape, and she learns that Dontos wasn't quite who he seemed.
Â 
2)Â  Sansa mopes around.Â  Then she's ambushed by Joffrey's death and whisked away by Dontos with no real opportunity to assess anything and having taken no particular decisions on her own.
Â 
I have a hard time seeing how anyone could view the latter as a story where Sansa has more agency and respect from the narrative than the former.Â  Sansa in the former actually accomplished something.

Tyrion was stuffed into a barrel during his escape. Agency? Dany was sold to Drogo. And no one would complain that these characters lack agency in their own story. Each character needs his moments of powerlessness, a character cannot be always in charge, otherwise he or she would be cardboard flat.
2794	Little Lark	2014-04-15	Thing is, Tywin believes Tyrion did it, and would probably have believed the same of Sansa.Â  Moreover, a public accusation of the sort Cersei made would be hard to get around, given the circumstances, even if he didn't.Â  This is especially true given that, if she had actually been arrested, the poison would have quite possibly been uncovered.


Â 
I don't know about this. There is a very good chance that the poison would have been discovered if Sansa had been arrested. We know from Tyrion's trial that Pycelle knows about this poison and probably could have identified it on sight, had he been looking for it. On the other hand, I don't know that Sansa would have been arrested at all for a few reasons:
Â 
1. Cersei did immediately jump to the conclusion that Tyrion had poisoned Joffrey but the thought that Sansa was also involved didn't enter her head until later. Of course we'll never know what might have happened if Sansa hadn't fled the scene. If she had stuck around and stayed within Cersei's line of vision, she may also have been accused of murder on the spot. However, Tyrion has the distinction of having made several threats to Cersei in the past that would make him look guilty. Despite the fact that Sansa had every reason to hate the Lannisters, she never openly disparaged them to anyone but Olenna and Margaery (and even then she was only talking about Joffrey). What's more, in the books we know that a number of guests ran out of the room as Joff was dying, including Sansa. Even if she had not been leaving the city that night, there is a still a chance that she would have fled with the rest, returning to her chambers and thus avoiding a public accusation from Cersei. While we can't know for sure, I think that the major source of Sansa's apparent guilt is that she disappeared from the city right after the murder took place.Â 
Â 
2. That said, I'm sure Cersei would have eventuallyÂ assumed that Sansa was involved, however, there's a good chance that Tywin would have vetoed the idea pretty quickly. He'd made Roose Bolton the Warden of the North but he never intended that the Bolton's should hold this position permanently. Tywin made it pretty clear to Tyrion that they needed Sansa to produce an Lannister heir to Winterfell in order to consolidate their power over the northmen. In the show, Jaime is already back in King's Landing and at odds with Tywin but in the books, Jaime had not yet returned and Tywin was still hoping to talk him out of the King's guard. Because of Sansa's valuable position as the "only remaining" heir to Winterfell, I think Tywin would have been pretty loath to have her killed off. Personally, I think he would have kept her to marry to Jaime upon his return.
Â 
I could be wrong about this, and anyway I'm sure Sansa's "safety" in King's Landing would have been compromised with Tywin's death. That said, I agree with all of the above posts that Sophie Turner did an AMAZING job in this episode!!!Â

Â 
Except Sansa having agency in her escape is canon to the books and we are allowed to be frustrated that her moments of agency are removed from the show. They stripped her from acts of defiance on the showÂ so muchÂ that I even wish they added the part where Sansa went to Cersei in AGOT.Â
2796	Colonel Green	2014-04-15	1. Cersei did immediately jump to the conclusion that Tyrion had poisoned Joffrey but the thought that Sansa was also involved didn't enter her head until later.

I have no idea what your point is.Â  You indeed cite situations where the characters didn't have agency, but Sansa had agency in this situation in the books.Â  Especially important in that it was virtually her only vehicle to have any to date (unlike Tyrion and Dany).Â  And the show cut it, leaving her consistently without agency for the last three seasons.

They could have easily left out the "florian and jonquil" part and still done the storyline so your argument holds no water. Especially since they removed Sansa's obsession with songs from her character even though it was essential to her character.Â

2799	Chebyshov	2014-04-15	The word agency is being overused in this thread.Â 


Â 
It's to make up for it being underused in Sansa's plot.
Â 
And I think discussing her agency is useful, because Show!Sansa is still a passive victim. It was a big character moment for Book!Sansa to be proactive about her escape. It's sad we've been robbed of it.
2800	'96Buck	2014-04-15	The series messed up, though.Â  The way they played it, Margeary really did seem to have control over Joffrey, even at the wedding.Â  Cersei's fears about that were justified.Â  In the series, it doesn't logically follow that they would want Joffrey dead.Â  They seemed to have control of the king.


she may have had some influence, sure.Â  That's a lot different than control.Â  Margarey didn't want her brother humiliated in front of (figuratively) the whole kingdom.Â  She didn't want a scene with the book and snubbing Sansa.Â  She didn't want the scene with Tyrion.
Â 
And that's in front of Tywin and Cersei and the Realm.Â  What happens behind closed doors?
2801	Woman of War	2014-04-15	It's to make up for it being underused in Sansa's plot.

I think the way the episode goes Sansa transfers far more getting a grip of the situation than that pseudo-active escape. In the books she may not be shipped  in a literal barrel with Dontos but for sure in a mental one.
Edit: we are actually comparing two storylines by Martin himself. He adapted  (imo improved) the HBO solution since now we have a far older and more mature Sansa who deserves to be taken seriously in a different way.

2802	Colonel Green	2014-04-15	Then maybe Sansa is meant to be a more or less passive victim at this point of the story


But she's not a passive victim.Â  She's active in trying to escape, and showing courage in doing so; she isn't just sitting around, which is what the show version is doing.Â  She doesn't understand everything going on around her, but that she's ultimately being manipulated doesn't take away from her being an active agent.
Â 

Â Edit: we are actually comparing two storylines by Martin himself. He adapted (imo improved) the HBO solution since now we have a far older and more mature Sansa who deserves to be taken seriously in a different way.

The book Sansa was far more mature than the show's version to date, and her ability to act for herself was part of that.Â  Indeed, TV Sansa has acted younger than the book version for most of the show's run, in particular last year, where she seemed to forget there was a war going on.
Â 
This storyline isn't "by Martin himself".Â  The showrunners plot the series, and Martin works from their template.Â  The decision to cut Sansa's agency was theirs, not his.
2803	Little Lark	2014-04-15	No, the idea enters her head at the same time:
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>Arrest my brother,â<U+0080><U+009D> she commanded him. â<U+0080><U+009C>He did this, the dwarf. Him and his little wife. They killed my son. Your king. Take them! Take them both!â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
I have no idea what your point is.Â  You indeed cite situations where the characters didn't have agency, but Sansa had agency in this situation in the books.Â  Especially important in that it was virtually her only vehicle to have any to date (unlike Tyrion and Dany).Â  And the show cut it, leaving her consistently without agency for the last three seasons.


Â 
Ahh, totally forgot about that. It's been a while since I've re-read ASoS. Thanks for pointing it out!

Â 
Neither book nor TV Sansa had a lot of agency. Â Sansa was operating in an information void in a viper's nest; and had to judge things pretty much on face value, and she was already quite nervous about trusting the wrong people.
Â 
As I recall, book-Sansa realized, during the course of her meetings with Dontos, that he was not exactly the Florian of her girlish dreams, i.e. his slobbering and drinking and making her wait so long for the actual escape. Â She had agency enough to decide to marry Willas Tyrell instead of continuing in Dontos' escape conspiracy; but foolishly told Dontos about that decision, because she didn't know Dontos was reporting to Littlefinger who wanted Sansa for himself (and Sansa had no way of knowing that). Â So she was making decisions that would affect her life, even though she did not have all the information about what was going on behind the scenes. Â And after Sansa was married to Tyrion, she faced the choice of staying with Tyrion, maybe traveling with him to Casterly Rock or Essos (as he had offered) and still being subject to King Joffrey's whims, or continuing to work with Dontos, a man she suspected of being not totally competent and knew was a drunkard, for the chance of an escape. Â Sansa took a chance and opted for the escape plan, despite her frustration and concerns with the man who presented it. Â To me, that shows more agency than the girl in the TV show, who rejected two less chancy offers of escape (from TV-Sandor who had not threatened to rape her, and TV-Littlefinger who had directly offered to take her away), who is suddenly, when the poisoning of Joffrey casts all into chaos, is told by Dontos that she has to go with him, and does. Â 
Â 
TV-Sansa makes a sudden decision in a moment when her environment has changed from relatively safe to totally chaotic and possibly dangerous; book-Sansa makes a difficult (considering who offers it) decision weeks earlier, conceals it from her captors and works to implement it (going to the Godswood for secret meetings with Dontos, smuggling in the clothes, etc.). Â I think book-Sansa shows more of what I would consider "agency". Â I do think it's great that the TV writers finally let TV Sansa make any decision, i.e. decide to go with Dontos as Joffrey is dying, but they have made the TV version of the character more passive than the original book character of Sansa, in my opinion.
2805	Three sisters	2014-04-16	I thought it pretty neat that you can hear the 'pling' when Olenna drops the poisoned stone in the cup. When you watch carefully, you see her removing the stone, casually walking by the table, and then the 'pling' of the falling stone, subtle, but not completely hidden by the music.
2806	Rohanne4	2014-04-17	So, my brother who has not read the books really likes Sansa. He doesn't find her terribly interesting, but he thinks she is the only realistic characters in the whole series, even how she was in the beginning of the show. And after all that has happened to her, she has remained kind and good (he thinks she is a lot like Ned). He believes she has a quiet strength and that she will not tolerate being there forever. After this episode, he was glad sheÂ choseÂ to go with Dontos. He thinks she will head to the Eyrie. Anyways, thought I would share that some show fans do pick up on her subtleties, and that not a lot of dialogue is needed to convey how she feels, especially since Sophie does such an amazing job.
2807	joachim	2014-04-17	It occurs to me that they might've omitted her part in the planning so as not to tip off that something was going to happen at the wedding.
2808	Colonel Green	2014-04-17	It occurs to me that they might've omitted her part in the planning so as not to tip off that something was going to happen at the wedding.


That may well have been their thinking, but it's poorly considered on several levels, chief among them: the sense that something will happen at the wedding is what's generally called building suspense, and the fact that Sansa will be planning an escape doesn't somehow equal to the audience that Joffrey will die, so it does not spoil anything.Â  The books managed things just fine.
2809	ground_control	2014-04-17	In the show, Petyr *talks* to Sansa about leaving, but doesn't actually offer a plan until after she's agreed to marry Loras, so she turns him down.
Â 
Petyr then screws that up, and Sansa is regretting not taking that offer after being married off to Tyrion, and then Joff dies in front of her and Dontos offers an escape and she jets.
Â 
I'm not sure how this isn't close enough to the books, or how this doesn't show Sansa's "agency" (she chooses to decline Petyr's offer of escape because she wants to marry Loras). Â Dontos's dialog may be a bit lame, but Sansa doesn't have to take his offer, she sees a chance to get out of Lannisterville and she takes it.
Â 
I'm not sure how adding several (probably boring and awkwardly written) scenes establishing a relationship with Dontos would make the show *better* than the admittedly less subtle, but also less painful, faster way the show did it.
2810	Colonel Green	2014-04-18	That's not nearly the same, particularly in terms of how active Sansa is (she just stands around and people come up to her), and who she's interacting with (all her interactions with Littlefinger do is allow the audience to call her dumb for thinking about going with him since he's so obviously a villain).

2812	Colonel Green	2014-04-18	Errr... Sansa rejects Littlefinger in Season 3, by being an active character who makes her own choices, which some people define as "agency"


Like I said, I don't think it's nearly the same thing, beginning with her continued passivity throughout, and extending to the way the people she interacts with are framed.
2813	Annara Snow	2014-04-18	That's not nearly the same, particularly in terms of how active Sansa is (she just stands around and people come up to her), and who she's interacting with (all her interactions with Littlefinger do is allow the audience to call her dumb for thinking about going with him since he's so obviously a villain).


Â 
I generally agree, but to be fair here... wouldn't planning to run away with Dontos do the same, since he's not incredibly trustworthy either? It could have gotten her desperation to get away from KL across, but in the show, he just comes out of the blue ages after she saved him, and in the books, he's a bit creepy and seems full of shit (constantly going on about being her Florian and asking for a kiss), and in both of these, he is a pathetic drunk who doesn't seem incredibly capable. And book Sansa even trusted him enough to tell him about her planned marriage to Willas (an instance in which the show made someone else do something "stupid" instead of Sansa). Not to mention book!Dontos telling Sansa that the hairnet is "magic" and will help her get home and not explaining how.
Â 
When it comes to Sansa trying to get away from King's Landing/trusting people to get her out, however you do it, she can always be called either naive ("stupid" as some would say) or passive. It's a no-win situation. Either she decides to trust some of these shady people to get her out (or is simply too desperate to care, but people are not going to see the difference) or she does nothing because she correctly thinks none of them can be trusted.
Â 
ETA: Just thought of another instant in which Sansa didn't think things through - despite planning to get away from KL for a while, she was surprised that they were going to the Vale, because she had thought she was going to Winterfell. Winterfell was a half-burnt rubble at that point, and the Boltons were ruling the North, and she must have been aware of that. I hope they don't include that line in the show.

2814	Konradsmith	2014-04-18	^Maybe LF will say "I'm taking you to your family" instead of "taking you home". Either way he's telling the truth in a selective way to give her a false impression of what to expect from him.
2815	ground_control	2014-04-18	To the people saying Sansa has "no agency", I'm curious -- what are you expecting (wanting) her to do in order to show "agency"?
Â 
She's a 13-16 year old female noble of an "out of favor" House forcibly married to the least popular male noble in King's Landing. Â  She's continually watched and guarded and largely restricted to the Red Keep. Â She hadn't been in King's Landing very long (a few months) long enough to make many acquaintances (much less friends) outside of her family's retainers before the sh*t went down, and then her family, friends, and retainers were all killed (or worse). Â She's surrounded by people of varying degrees of friendliness who all see her as "the key to the North" before anything else.
Â 
Despite whatever freedoms of movement she appears to have, she has to (correctly) assume that her enemies will see and hear almost anything she does, and she has little basis to know if anybody is truly on her side. Â She is a pawn in other people's games, and she's just beginning to learn the game. Â The reality is that her main "moves" are pretty much choosing how to react to other people's attempts to use/move her. Â In the book we can literally read her mind, but from an "outside" view -- i.e., what she shows to all the people watching her, both in-show and a television audience, shes showing us (the audience) exactly what she *should* want the Lannisters (her captors) to see -- a quiet, dutiful young Lady who does what she's told.
Â 
She has a very limited range of things she can do (even before captivity), but the choices she makes do have consequences:
Â 
1) She declines to testify against Joff or Arya at the Trident
2) She runs to the Queen when she's about to be shipped back to Winterfell
3) She almost kills King Joff (per Book and Show, it's pretty clear that only the Hound stepping in between her and Joff prevents her from pushing him off the wall at the end of AGOT)
4) She saves Ser Dontos
5) She agrees to marry Willas in order to get free of the Lannisters (declining Littlefinger's offer)
6) She chooses which Lannister to help at her wedding (I prefer the Book version, but I don't think the show version is wrong -- Tyrion was going to use a stool and not make her kneel, Joff removes the stool, so while kneeling may be seen as choosing to be nice to Tyrion, it can be seen as countering Joff)
7) She chooses to go with Dontos

2816	Pimphand Giantfinger	2014-04-18	If anybody is a close watcher of the show and an astute reader of the books you'll notice that LF has stolen two of the Hounds lines from the book.
Â 
Why is this the case? ( besides the obvious, its just easier for the show pace to have it done this way.)
Â 
1. In season one it is Petyr not Sandor whom tells her about how his face was burned. ( the Lying game in my opinion. Just testing her to see if she can keep a secret and she only tells her sister which is expected since Arya will never divulge the secret.)
Â 
2. At the end of season two he yet again steals a Sandor line when he tells her they are all better liars here, after she is dismissed for Margery. ( adaptation of the little bird sequence.)
Â 
I think the Sandor/Arya plotine will connect to the Littefinger/Sansa/Lysa/Vale for the show. The boat the brought the troop of dwarfs from Braavos and took Sansa to the Vale will also be used to carry Arya to Braavos after her and hound cut their way through moonbrothers and stormcrows in the " mountains" .

2817	Beric175	2014-04-18	They'll telegraph another meet-up between Arya and her relatives but then the Hound dies by Rorge and she escapes, leaving him to die. Also, LF, stop stealing the Hound's lines, you sly trickster.
2818	Colonel Green	2014-04-18	To the people saying Sansa has "no agency", I'm curious -- what are you expecting (wanting) her to do in order to show "agency"?


The stuff she did in the books.
Â 


^Maybe LF will say "I'm taking you to your family" instead of "taking you home". Either way he's telling the truth in a selective way to give her a false impression of what to expect from him.


I suspect they'll drop that altogether.Â  It's one of GRRM's kind of cheap misdirects at the end of a chapter, and while it might work okay in a book with a lot of space between chapters, on the show having him imply they're going north in episode 3 and then turn around and reveal they aren't in episode 4/5 would look really lame.
2819	Skore	2014-04-18	Â 
Â 
i don't know. it's impossible to think that given cersei screaming "murder". it also doesn't help that joffrey had just finished completely humiliating tyrion in a very public way which already had everyone on edge. there's no way the tyrells could have anticipated that.


Â 
We have more info on this from the books. Joffrey didn't want the dwarf jousters until a certain person pointed out how much his uncle would hate it.
2820	Rhaenys Reborn	2014-04-18	I think book Sansa does have more agency than show Sansa, for the reasons already named. I always dreaded the fact they eliminated the Willas part of the book and replaced him with - of all people - Loras. It's just so unfair to her character. While book Sansa also fancied Loras and would have most likely jumped at the opportunity to marry him, still the way she taught herself to be excited about Willas did tell us a lot about her. And then her disappointment when she realized the Tyrells only wanted her for her rights. At that point she didn't want to be queen anymore, she didn't want a handsome gallant knight, she just wanted to be loved and to have a safe place she could call home. Show Sansa was deprived of this kind of emotions.
Â 
And then the way they made her marry Tyrion. Book Sansa had minutes to accept the situation and to realize Tyrion wasn't the worst husband she could've got. He offers her Lancel, but she chooses Tyrion. Again we are shown she's done with dreaming about pretty knights. Show Sansa has days to prepare for the wedding and that leads her to complain to Margaery that her husband to be is a dwarf.
Â 
Not kneeling - as bad as it made me feel for Tyrion - was an awesome Stark pride moment they probably took away from her to make her more likeable by the viewers. Her entire relationship with Tyrion is more sweet and understanding and a little too friendly. As much as it hurt seing them both so miserable in the books, it made more sense.
Â 
And then we have all the show viewers who can't understand why she didn't escape with the Hound since he asked so nicely. The entire SanSan storyline was made wrong from the beginning and I can see the show makers with severe headaches if GRRM decides to finally act on the romantic slash sexual tension between these characters. Show Sansa and show Sandor in a sexual scene? gah
2821	Gregor Blows in the Wind	2014-04-18	I'm slightly amused by the amount of posts using "agency" as a catchall for Sansa's possible decisions in King's Landing (but if some posters will adopt ideas and present them as their own, why not words?). I understand and sympathize with the frustrations that come with adapting any book to the screen, but let's not forget that she won't be going butch and shacking up with Ser Boros just because it tickles her fancy. She's a prisoner. And on television, for non-book followers, following her growing period from Ned's death through the Purple Wedding would have just come across as sappy. Instead we watch as she endures.
Â 
Not that the book-version of Sansa's story was sappy, nor that it couldn't be interesting. But character studies are tough to do when there's only so much screen time allowed. I thought that with the cuts made, they allowed Sophie Turner quite a lot of "agency" in which to sell this character's story. And she nailed it.

Â 

I don't disagree. But I'm quite invested in her story. Weekly watchers of the show aren't necessarily too interested in being presented her emotional options. It takes time that only a book can utilize to get that across, and as I said, I think it could have really gotten bogged down. The show-runners gave her a chunk of time, and presented her as a naAve, good-hearted young lady in spite of each new horror. Which is right in line with what the book was. She was spoiled and a bit entitled. She suffered. She came out of it much better than most (arguably all).
Â 

Well, actually, we watched her be a joke on the show for a while, and sit around doing nothing (the thing that book readers often incorrectly accuse her of).
Â 

And I say you incorrectly accuse her of sitting around. I mean, yeah she doesn't pick a sword up and slay each of her tormentors, but "sitting around," in the context of her role? Nah. She was a joke in King's Landing, not the production team's office, and the portrayal is close IMO. Book Sansa is allowed room to grow through her interior monologue, which Show Sansa does not have the luxury of. So we only get to see her reactions, her kindnesses, and the person she was just as she was forced to run.

the show won't have any headaches about how they've portrayed sansan. this plotline will either not amount to anything "romantic slash sexual" as you put it or it will become that after a few years, when sansa is older. either way, its a win-win for the show. sansa is 14 on the show. if sansa stays hidden during the long winter, and it's possible that she will, she'll be an adult in the eyes of modern viewers. and if not, and she meets sandor and they become best buddies, still no problem.Â

A punchline within the show.Â  Like the scene built around her not knowing the word "shit", for instance.Â  Or the one where she thinks her family will be coming to her wedding.Â  Or the "sex talk" which ends with Margaery giving up because she's dumb and missed the point of everything Margaery was saying.Â  Or the scenes built around making a joke of how she doesn't know Loras is gay.Â  All of those scenes are there to make the audience laugh at her.

SanSan was always super popular in the fandom, and became even more so after the show.Â  Many of them have never read the books.Â  He's playing down in age, they had him listed in his 30's in the pilot.Â  She's 15, she had her name day since the last time she said her age.Â  She seemed pretty stoked to have sex with Loras last season.Â  Seems like a lot of interest in the story.Â  And GRRM wrote a scene with him sticking out his tongue and staring at her, he said it was beautiful (GRRM seems to really dig age gaps, there's one in his latest story with a 16 year old and a 49 year old).Â 
Â 
You've said you want Sansa to end up with Tyrion.Â  Are you making the same prediction about that?Â  Pretty sure the actors who play both characters are about the same age.
Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 
the show won't have any headaches about how they've portrayed sansan. this plotline will either not amount to anything "romantic slash sexual" as you put it or it will become that after a few years, when sansa is older. either way, its a win-win for the show. sansa is 14 on the show. if sansa stays hidden during the long winter, and it's possible that she will, she'll be an adult in the eyes of modern viewers. and if not, and she meets sandor and they become best buddies, still no problem.Â 
Â 
there's a joke that every time sean bean is cast, it's an automatic spoiler that the character he's playing will die, since it happens so often. i think the moment they cast rory, it looked a lot like a spoiler of what wouldn't be happening between sansa and sandor, but that's just one opinion. it all remains to be seen.
Â 
Peter Dinklage and Rory McCann were both born in 1969. Rory is turning 45 the next week (on the 24th), Peter in June. (Interesting fact - Aidan Gillen has the same birthday as Rory, but he's a year older and will be turning 46 next week.)
Â 
I'm pretty sure everyone on the show is playing down their age, with the exception of Peter Vaughn, Julian Glover and David Bradley, who are playing older than they are, for obvious reasons, and the new Mountain, who is a special case. (Jason Momoa may have been the only actor who was exactly his character's age.) Ned is certainly not meant to be 50 in season 1 and Catelyn is not meant to be in her late 40s, it makes no sense. It's not like they waited till they were 30+ till they got married and had kids, in their kind of society. Tyrion is supposed to be a few years younger than Jaime and Cersei, but Peter Dinklage is older than both his on-screen 'siblings'. The actors playing 17-year olds or 16-year olds (Richard Madden, Kit Harrington, Emilia Clarke, Joe Dempsie) are all in their late 20s. It would be ridiculous to expect a 27-year old actor to be cast as Sandor. Imagine someone who looks the same age as Sansa's "teenage" brothers playing Sandor. The show has also tried to make people like Dany/Jorah and has even tried to make Tyrion/Sansa more palatable or rootable, so to speak (which I find mind-boggling, but I guess it's a consequence of D&D's feelings for Tyrion). And they've played with Arya/Gendry, too.
Â 
I've seen that argument before and I've always found it mind-boggling. I mean, really, Sansa is 11 in the books and 12 at the time of the Blackwater battle. Sandor is supposed to look old enough to pass for Arya's father, at least. How is it less appropriate to play with future romantic possibilities between a 14-year old girl played by a 16-year old and a (probably) 30-something played by a 43-year old man - compared to a 12-year old an a 27-year old man? Her age is the problem. Imagine if they actually had cast a 26/27-year old guy and an 11-year old actress and what that would look like. Say, imagine an ambiguously-romantic scene between Richard Madden and the actress who played Lizzie on The Walking Dead. Can anyone imagine people shipping that if they saw it on screen?
Â 
It's also funny because Hollywood is infamous for casting younger actresses (15 years younger on average, often more) as love interests for older, famous male leads. It's normal for Hollywood as long as the woman is of age. It's the opposite that happens rarely, though some brave movies and TV shows have done it (the pairing of Nick Stahl and Adrienne Barbeau on Carnivale, for instance, though they eventually abandoned that in season 2 in favor of an age appropriate ship tease).
Â 
I sometimes think that some book fans may have created some unlikely images in their head of what the characters look like, with a Sandor who looks like a modern-day 27-year old guy (basically, the age that Richard Madden, Kit Harington and Joe Dempsie are) andÂ  a Sansa who looks like she's 18-20 (though Sophie Turner actually has turned 18 now and has looked like she could have been 20+ since season 2 at least). Basically, something similar to how Jack from Will and Grace described The O.C.: "...25-year-old teenagers and 35-year-old parents."
Â 
And it's also interesting to note that GRRM, when asked who he saw in the role of Sandor when he was writing the books, said Ron Perlman.
Â 
And yep, I've seen lots of SanSan shipping by the Unsullied during the first two seasons. But it seems almost forgotten now, simply because the characters are have been in different locations and don't talk about each other.

Â 
But it's not about how old the characters are (of course we don't want a 12 year old during the Blackwater scene... although on the other hand that scene was so watered down compared to the books that it wouldn't be inappropriate at all), it's about how big the age difference is. There is more or less 16 years between book!Sansa and book!Sandor. There is 27 years between Sophie and Rory.
Â 
Now tell me that doesn't make a huge difference.

Â 
Sansa is 11 in the first book and 12 in the second.
Â 
Now tell me how you would feel if you saw a "romantic" scene between Richard Madden (27) and this girl (11).
Â 
If you really think that a relationship between a pre-teen and a guy in his late 20s in more acceptable and less squicky than one between two adults with a 26-years difference... well, that's just nuts.
Â 
In real life, the latter will raise a few eyebrows and cause a bit of gossip or ridicule. (Like, say, Michael Douglas marrying Catherine Zeta Jones, or ) The former gets one of them straight into jail and sex offenders list.
Â 
Sansa was not an adult and neither was Sophie when she was filming season 2 (or season 3, but that didn't stop some TV viewers and TV articles writer from shipping her from Tyrion. Just like her age difference with Rory didn't stop the SanSan shipping among the Unsullied). But it would have looked 100 times more uncomfortable if she was meant to be 12 and was played by an actress who was actually 12 (if we are going by "actors' age = characters' age").
Â 
Bottom line, age differences matter a whole lot less the older the younger person is.

Honestly, it's the character Martin wrote. Those are new scenes written for the show, but it isn't a rethinking of Sansa by any stretch. It actually really helps show just how much she's kept her innocence. And that to me is important to her arc.

You're not getting my point. Of course I agree with aging the kids up. But if they aged show Sansa up to 13 at the beginning (the actress was about 14-15), then they should have cast a more or less 31 year old guy to play Sandor. Not a 40-something year old.

You say dumb, I say naAve. I suppose the family at the wedding bit could be more accurately described as flighty, or hell, if you want to call it dumb that's fine with me. But I don't think it's a damning piece of dumb. She's a scared girl, in over her head, and maintained a semblance of dignity and a full-blown good heart. Book and show. She was petty at times because, to her, that was her only way to act out without fearing for her life (or maybe just the only way she knew how). Book and show.
Â 
If she asked about her family coming to her wedding while still trying to come to terms with the prospect of marrying a Lannister, or a dwarf, or really just anyone who didn't fit her preconceived notion of knight in shining armor, I can certainly not say it's automatically out of character for either Sansa or any other previously-sheltered young girl. Book or show.

Â 
Together with casting a 37-year old to play Ned, a 33-year old s Littlefinger, a 25-year old to play Tyrion, and teenagers to play Robb, Jon, Dany, Margaery, Loras and Gendry?
Â 
You're not getting my point. Why should Sandor be cast with an actor of the character's age, when all the other characters are not? Why should they cast someone as Sandor who's about the same age as the characters who are playing older teenagers? Should he look the same age as Robb and Jon? Shouldn't he look older than Tyrion, just a few years younger than Littlefinger, no more than 8-9 years younger than Ned? It would look awfully weird if Sandor looked the same age as Robb.
Â 
Should he look younger than all the adults around him? Why should there be an exception just for him? To make his relationship with Sansa look more age appropriate for shipping and less weird and uncomfortable? It's not supposed to be age appropriate, he's supposed to look at least old enough for people to think he's Arya's father (and Arya is just 2 years younger than Sansa) and it is weird and uncomfortable in the books. She was 12 the last time they've seen each other.

Sandor is a special, delicate case. None of the remaining actors who play "adults" is in a somewhat romantic relationship with a minor. I don't get you. You say it's creepy to imagine a 27 year old with a 12 year old (which I agree), but you're actually arguing the bigger age gap the better?
Â 
If the actor playing Sandor would have been 31 in season 1, he would still have been older than the actors who play Robb, Jon, Dany, Loras etc. And even if he looked closer in age to them, so what? it's not like it matters to the storyline, unlike his age difference with Sansa.
Â 
And book Sandor is only a few years older than book Tyrion so making him look a bit younger wouldn't be that much of a deal either. The other characters and their age difference with Sandor are completely irrelevant. The only characters whose age difference with him IS relevant are Sansa and Arya.

Â 
You've just provided the reasons why it doesn't matter at all if the actor is 30 or 40. It's "creepy" either way (but less creepy than it would be if they cast according to the book ages), so how does that change anything?
Â 
I'm not arguing that "the bigger age difference, the better", I'm arguing that it makes little difference and that it's absurd to argue that the fact that the actor was over 40 was some sort of a "spoiler" that the characters won't ever get romantically involved.
Â 
Did anyone really want Sansa to get together with Sandor when she was 12? Those who think this will eventually happen think it will happen when she grows up. We don't know how old she will be the next time they meet, but she'll certainly be two years older than that in the show, and played by an actress who's not a minor anymore. Nobody gives a shit about age difference once when both partners are adults.

If I were looking at this from her perspective, it would seem to me that the war is between the Starks and the Lannisters, not the Starks and the Tyrells, so...
2843	Newstar	2014-04-18	Tyrion is supposed to be a few years younger than Jaime and Cersei, but Peter Dinklage is older than both his on-screen 'siblings'.
Â 
Thanks to 4x01 and 2x09, we can pinpoint TV Tyrion's age. Cersei tells Sansa that she was "just four" years old when she prayed just after her mother had died, and as of 4x01 Jaime is 40 (and Cersei as well, obviously), putting Tyrion at 36 as of Season 4. It's a good deal younger than Peter Dinklage's RL age (45 and counting), and a good deal older than Book Tyrion's age, but neither of those things is terribly surprising since most of the older generation is aged up considerably.
Â 
I have no idea how old TV Hound is supposed to be, though. Book Hound is three or four years older than Book Tyrion, according to the Wiki, so I guess that would put TV Hound around 39 or 40 or so if they were sticking with that age difference.
Â

Nobody gives a shit about age difference once when both partners are adults.

Pro tip: if you have to use language often trotted out to defend the Doug Hutchisons of the world to argue in favour of a ship, you are very clearly Doing It Wrong.
Â 
Â 
Â 
ETA: Just thought of another instant in which Sansa didn't think things through - despite planning to get away from KL for a while, she was surprised that they were going to the Vale, because she had thought she was going to Winterfell. Winterfell was a half-burnt rubble at that point, and the Boltons were ruling the North, and she must have been aware of that.
Â 
Well, Book Sansa's not the sharpest knife in the drawer.

I'm not sure either what my posts in this thread have to do with "defending a ship" and even less sure what any of this has to do with Doug Hutchison. I thought the problem was that he married a 16-year old, which is underage in most countries today and below the age of consent in many US states, right? I don't remember people ranting and denouncing Michael Douglas or Harrison Ford, there were jokes but that was it.
Â 
I'm also not sure what your point is. Are you actually supporting Rhaenys' argument that SanSan would look more likely on the show if Sansa was the same age as she is - or even younger (as she is in the book) if Sandor was played by a 30-year old actor? I don't get your stance on this. Are you trying to defend 30-year olds to hook up with teenage girls while ranting about the skeeviness of 40-year oldsÂ  who do the same and trying to establish some sort of a reverse age of consent (it's OK for dudes to hook up with underage girls if they are not older than...25? 30? 35? What is the cutoff age)? Are you saying that it's "creepy" for a 29-year old to hook up with a 55-year old, but not for a 29-year old to hook up with a 13-year old? Please elaborate. 
Â 
Â I guess I could say now:
Â 
'"Pro tip: if you're defending Jerry Lee Lewises of this world in order to put down a ship, you're Doing It Wrong".
Â 
It would make about as much sense.

People didn't stop denouncing Doug Hutchison once Courtney Stodden aged up, as you recall, nor Woody Allen once Soon-Yi Previn aged up. The younger partner aging up does not magically negate the relationship's creepy origins or the prior interactions between the adult and the other partner as a minor, something you seemed to suggest with your creepy and hilariously inaccurate "Nobody gives a shit about age difference once both partners are adults." It would be one thing if adult Sandor met twentysomething adult Sansa and struck up a relationship with her with no prior interaction, let alone creepy or sexualized interactions with her when he was an adult and she was a minor. That would be questionable (Johnny Depp's getting flack over the Amber Heard age difference), maybe, but not inherently creepy. That is of course not the case with either Book Sandor or with TV Sandor. There's a big distinction there, one you seem to be ignoring in your haste to argue that a relationship between adult Sandor and adult Sansa once she ages up would not bother anyone.

Â 
Age differences between the characters or alterations from the book ages do not matter as long as that doesn't mess with the characters' relationships. They actually do not matter in any case but SanSan, like I said before, as it is the only "relationship" where a kid (both a character and an actress) is involved with a proper adult (and not an adult passing for a teen). That is why I don't get why you guys keep bringing up Tyrion, Cersei, Ned and a whole bunch of other characters who do not matter in this discussion.
Â 
For me there is a huge difference between a 16 year gap and a 27 year gap, ESPECIALLY given that both Sansa and Sophie are still teenagers. 16 years is a lot, but 27 is disturbing.
Â 
But whatever. Age is not the only issue I have with TV Sandor anyway.

Um, that's not what was being argued at all. The topic was not "is SanSan creepy" (if you want my honest opinion, yeah, it is - but so is 90% of stuff in ASOAIF, and about 70% of it is way creepier), it wasÂ  "is SanSan creepier/less acceptable if Sandor is played by a 40-year old actor rather than a 30-year old" or "is show SanSan less likely to happen than book SanSan because Sandor is played by a 40-year old instead of a 30-year old" and then it evolved into a discussion of whether "age difference" expressed in years is more important than the age of the younger partner.
Â 
If you can't argue a point without making an effort to read through and understand what the fuck is being discussed and that you're arguing against "points" that the other person hasn't made, maybe you shouldn't be arguing it. Because that way, you're not contributing to the discussion, you're just making one more of your annoying, creepy, wrongheaded and shitty posts. Just a thought,

For me there is a huge difference between a 16 year gap and a 27 year gap, ESPECIALLY given that both Sansa and Sophie are still teenagers. 16 years is a lot, but 27 is disturbing.
Â 
But whatever. Age is not the only issue I have with TV Sandor anyway.


Â 
Since Sansa and Sophie are still teenagers, it is disturbing either way (and even more so in the book, because she's even younger) - or would be, if they were actually 'involved'.
Â 
Thing is, they are not and never were actually "involved". Which you probably agree on, since you put the "relationship" in quotation marks.
2849	Rhaenys Reborn	2014-04-18	Â 
Um, that's not what was being argued at all. The topic was not "is SanSan creepy" (if you want my honest opinion, yeah, it is - but so is 90% of stuff in ASOAIF), it wasÂ  "is SanSan creepier/less acceptable if Sandor is played by a 30-year old actor rather than a 40-year old" or "is show SanSan less likely to happen than book SanSan because Sandor is played by a 40-year old instead of a 30-year old" and then it evolved into a discussion of whether "age difference" expressed in years is more important than the age of the younger partner.


Â 
You mean "less creepy/more acceptable"  but other than that, that's a perfect sum up of the discussion.
However please keep in mind I do not claim the age of the younger partner is not important - I'm just saying, keeping Sansa as she is (around 14 at this point) SanSan would be much more acceptable if Sandor was played by a 30 year old dude. Or 30-something. Or if he at least looked thirtish.

Â 
Yeah, sorry about that. I used "involved" for the lack of a better word. I meant they have a semi-romantic storyline that will potentially lead to being romatically involved in the future. And then the 27 year old difference will kill me.

Â 
Well, maybe you're right up to a point, what with pop culture telling us that it's perfectly OK when teenage girls hook up/have sex/marry and have babies with 200-year old vampires who look 25/30-year old... 
Â 
Then again, the show seemed to be trying to go out of its way to make people think that Sansa and Tyrion "had a chance before the Red Wedding" and some entertainment magazine even ran a poll "who would be better for Sansa, Tyrion or Loras"  and that was several orders of magnitude creepier, what with her being a captive forced into marriage by her enemies.
Â 
And this is also a series where two arguably main heroes (according to many people at least) found their true loves with the people who initially raped them for all intents and purposes - and the show made it even worse in Dany's case. So I don't really know if arguing that they avoid creepy and uncomfortable makes sense after that...

Â 
Well, sure, but your basis for arguing that show SanSan is no less likely to happen for the use of a 40-something actor as opposed to a younger actor was to invoke a creepy, inaccurate argument about how age differences are not perceived as a big deal once the minor partner ages up, something demonstrably untrue for RL relationships analogous to SanSan where the adult engaged in creepy or sexualized interactions with the other partner when that partner was a minor and where the relationship's creepiness wasn't seen to be magically erased once the minor partner became an adult.
Â 
And if you can't argue your point without saying creepy, erroneous bullshit, which "Nobody gives a shit about age differences once both partners are adults," in the context of a relationship like SanSan which involved creepy, sexualized interactions between an adult and a minor, most certainly is, then you probably shouldn't be arguing it. What's next, a fevered treatise on how everyone should just leave Woody Allen alone?

If TV!Sansa looked 14, I don't think it would be much more acceptable. The thing is, TV!Sansa pretty much looks of age, so I don't think any romantic relationships she may develop would visually look disturbing. A bit kinky perhaps, but it wouldn't look like a Lolita or that Natalie Portman movie in which she plays a 12 years old assassin and has some sort of relationship with Jean Reno.
Â 
Now, the storyline can make any such relationships undesirables from the viewer's viewpoint and the character age might have to be brought forward and emphasized again, because she clearly looks older than the reported age of her character.

Â 
I've gone back and forth on this, but I think TV Sansa's naive belief that her family would be permitted to attend the wedding is on about the same level of stupidity as Book Sansa 1) thinking that Olenna meant to marry her to Loras, a Kingsguard, 2) needing to be told that the Tyrells only want her for her claim, 3) not understanding why Willas Tyrell would want Winterfell when he already had Highgarden, 4) taking everything Book Margaery tells her about Willas' virtues at face value, and 5) ignoring Dontos' warning in favour of fantasies of puppies and barges. Book Sansa is pretty egregiously stupid in those parts of ASOS as well, so I can't really object to TV Sansa being equally stupid, if under different circumstances and involving a different suitor, in the show. Six of one, half dozen of the other, really.
Â 
Sansa's stupidity is a bit of a joke within the books' narrative, as well, in between all the characters she interacts with who mock her stupidity or allude to it, and goodness, there are a lot of them. You might not have TV Shae smiling to herself about Sansa gushing about Loras' love of brocade, or TV Tyrion trying not to laugh at Sansa getting "shit" and "shift" confused, but you do have Book Olenna alluding to Sansa's reputation for stupidity ("...some say that you are as big a fool as Butterbumps here"), Sansa thinking "Maybe I truly am as stupid as Cersei Lannister says," and similar.
Â 
Going back a page:

Â 
It was in response to the silly, continuing use of the word "agency" in this thread.
Â 
"Agency" is a pretty common buzzword when it comes to discussing Sansa's arc, as many Sansa fans believe that Sansa's journey is primarily or even entirely about her having more control over her life and exercising agency over her life choices: from powerless to powerful, pawn to player, etc. etc. It sounds delightfully grand and high-minded, but it's usually just an argument that gets trotted out to argue that a SanSan endgame or at least hookup is inevitable. The whole obsession with agency strikes me as a bit odd, frankly, especially when it comes to those fans who get so tied up in the idea of Sansa's agency that they discuss her as if she's a sentient being or even a beloved surrogate daughter and not as a fictional character dancing on GRRM's strings (and the less said about them, the better), but yeah, it's an often seen concept in these discussions.
Â 
I am disappointed.
Â 
I live for no other aim than pleasing you, Annara Snow, dear heart. Accept my humblest apologies: 
Â 
...For real, I think we can leave that particular point there, since you've embarrassed yourself enough already and I have no wish to create further opportunities for you to dig yourself any deeper. Let's move on, shall we?

Â 
Â I get that it's the buzzword. Just kinda made me snort, is all. Probably better if I'd just let it be, but I saw it meaning different things for different people (as you pointed out), and thought maybe some scrutiny of the usage could force some to better flesh out their thoughts. 
To address the colonel: I don't think Sansa is a joke as a character because she's unable to magically acclimate herself to King's Landing and instantly "grow up" or something. That "shift" vulgarity is just a remnant of her upbringing. 
Brienne is a freakish joke amongst them as well. But the jokes tell us more about those making the jokes. Keeping some grace in spite of it all is a plus to these ladies' characters.
Edit: deleting parts of quoted passages is hard to do on my phone. I got rid of some things I meant to keep, sorry. Hope it makes sense.

Why?Â  There's nothing sappy about that story.Â  It's full of drama.Â  Her first visit to the Godswood would have been excellent TV.


Â 
Well said. It would certainly have made better TV than the extended Pod brothel joke or some of the filler scenes they have given to Sansa in Season 3 like "porridge plague". Sansa going armed to the Godswood whilst dodging guards and then later at least harassing Dontos for them to escape earlier, would have shown her desperation to escape. Similarly even a scene of her smuggling her escape clothes to the Godswood and fooling Tyrion when he asks to join her would have shown her character development. Also the Purple Wedding would have come as more of a surprise as the anticipation would be will Sansa escape or not. Joff's death would then have come from completely out of left field. While most did not predict his death, most were expecting something to happen at the wedding.Â
2868	joachim	2014-04-19	Sansa going armed to the Godswood whilst dodging guards and then later at least harassing Dontos for them to escape earlier, would have shown her desperation to escape.


This version of Sansa wasn't desperate to escape. Where would she go?
2869	Le Cygne	2014-04-19	Back to the she has nowhere to go in the seven kingdoms but chilling with the Lannisters after they waged war with her family, killed many of them, forcibly married her to one of them she finds repulsive, and lots more awful stuff in store for her lovely future, including a price on her head after she's set up for killing Joffrey... Seriously, where else would be better than that?She was crying awfully hard when Littlefinger's ship sailed off, and she knew she had to marry Tyrion.
2870	Colonel Green	2014-04-19	This version of Sansa wasn't desperate to escape.


Um, why would you think that?Â  The book version was, in the same circumstances.
2871	joachim	2014-04-20	I think that, from her perspective, there is no escape. She was crying when Littlefinger's ship sailed away because she'd seen both of her escape plans blown apart in quick succession. Upon Margaery's suggestion, she tried to make the best of her circumstances.Â Then her family was massacred. How much does she know about the Red Wedding? She knows how Robb and Catelyn died, and from what Tyrion said, she seems to know that Tywin had a hand in it, but does she know what happened to Edmure and Brynden? Maybe she thinks that they were killed, too. She might only be dimly aware that she has an aunt in the ValeÂ - it certainly seemed to catch Arya off guard. To sum, she's gotÂ no means of escape, no family, and she's married into the family that destroyed hers. Under those conditions, wouldn't you find the outlook hopeless?
2872	Le Cygne	2014-04-20	The marriage was for heirs to take Winterfell. She rejected Tyrion sexually. She has no idea how long that reprieve will last, either from him or from the other Lannisters.Â  She just told him to go to hell at breakfast.Â  So she tries one time to get away, and it doesn't work, so she's going to give up?Â  Why doesn't she just jump off a cliff then?Â And you said she wasn't desperate to escape.Â  She clearly was...Â  Not seeing your point here.

This makes no sense. In the books it is certainly more obvious that she needs to get out of KL and she is debatably considering suicide if the Dontos plan fails. While in the show they have watered down how desperate her situation is, it is still obvious she would wish to get the hell out of KL as soon as possible regardless of where there was to go.

2874	solidviper	2014-04-21	I think book Sansa does have more agency than show Sansa, for the reasons already named. I always dreaded the fact they eliminated the Willas part of the book and replaced him with - of all people - Loras. It's just so unfair to her character. While book Sansa also fancied Loras and would have most likely jumped at the opportunity to marry him, still the way she taught herself to be excited about Willas did tell us a lot about her. And then her disappointment when she realized the Tyrells only wanted her for her rights. At that point she didn't want to be queen anymore, she didn't want a handsome gallant knight, she just wanted to be loved and to have a safe place she could call home. Show Sansa was deprived of this kind of emotions.
Â 
And then the way they made her marry Tyrion. Book Sansa had minutes to accept the situation and to realize Tyrion wasn't the worst husband she could've got. He offers her Lancel, but she chooses Tyrion. Again we are shown she's done with dreaming about pretty knights. Show Sansa has days to prepare for the wedding and that leads her to complain to Margaery that her husband to be is a dwarf.
Â 
Not kneeling - as bad as it made me feel for Tyrion - was an awesome Stark pride moment they probably took away from her to make her more likeable by the viewers. Her entire relationship with Tyrion is more sweet and understanding and a little too friendly. As much as it hurt seing them both so miserable in the books, it made more sense.
Â 
And then we have all the show viewers who can't understand why she didn't escape with the Hound since he asked so nicely. The entire SanSan storyline was made wrong from the beginning and I can see the show makers with severe headaches if GRRM decides to finally act on the romantic slash sexual tension between these characters. Show Sansa and show Sandor in a sexual scene? gah


Â 
I think the point in not having Sansa kneel isÂ because she had days instead of minutes to prepare for the wedding. Tyrion let her know that this wedding was not his intention. She knew he wasn't the cause for her being forced into a marriage, and at the actual wedding she realized that humiliating Tyrion would make Cersei and JofferyÂ happy. She decided to kneel to defy them in other ways. To wipe the smile off of their faces. Even in the books, as I recall, she regretted not kneeling because she saw that Cersei and Joff hated Tyrion.
Â 
I'm not saying she has to be bffs with Tyrion, but "the enemy of my enemy is my friend" is kind of at play here imo.Â

But wasnt it another Florent? Im pretty sure i heard them say Axell and not that other guy...
2878	Metopheles	2014-04-14	All was so perfect...liked the Shae thing.
Even if I am not a Stannis supporter, I suffered with him. That was lame.. They should have made the burning a bit better. Loved the Dinner with the Baratheons! Reminded me of Breaking Bad Walt, Skyler and Jesse 
Liked most changes.. was super surprised they kept and expanded the dwarf scene.
Boltons amazing as ever.
But the Purple Wedding... Everybody played astonishing, but Joffrey was just sad. Bad performance from the guy. And the death a bit meh. The scenes leading to it were so great and then this. AND I SO HOPED FOR AN AMAZING CERSEI SCREAM !!!Â 
 Â  Â   Â 
Cersei Joff and Jaime in a scene..great 
So the episode was great, except for the awkwardly done Stannis scene and the ending, which could have been way better.
Â 
Then again.. all just nitpicking. Â
2879	Envie	2014-04-14	My biggest nitpick was that I felt like they rushed all of the scenes before the final purple wedding. Maybe it's just me over anticipating the famous death of Joffrey but all the other scenes felt rushed and somewhat scattered all over the place. I think they tried to cram too many different plots into that first 30 minutes and sadly some of them needed more detail.
Â 
The scene with Reek shaving Ramsay was probably the best of them all and the only one I felt wasn't rushed. It was perfection. The tension in the room at that moment the blade was paused on his jugular when Ramsay told him Robb Stark was dead....absolutely priceless.
Â 
Like many others, I didn't like the Stannis / Selyse / Melisandre scenes at all... they felt wrong, disjointed and confusing. I know the forums are going to explode with all the Stannis 'character assassination' threads, but my gads they did sorta muck up that whole story line in this one.
Â 
When the final scene came and Joffrey lay dead - I felt some disappointment. I'm not exactly sure why yet. I rewatched it and felt the actors all did a great job and even though the whole thing felt 'stilted' - that's fitting with how awkward and tense the entire thing was in the books as well. I can't really say why I was disappointed. Maybe I expected more drama from Cersei or others looking on while Joffrey choked to death. I will say the graphic way they did his face more than made up for a lot of my disappointment with the lead up to it.
2880	Pod The Impaler	2014-04-14	But wasnt it another Florent? Im pretty sure i heard them say Axell and not that other guy...


Â 
Yeah, you're right, I think it was Alister.

I will say the graphic way they did his face more than made up for a lot of my disappointment with the lead up to it.


Â 
Â 
The scene had to be a bit more "visual" than the books, I guess. Less Cersei screaming, less "I want you to ride the pig, uncle *kof* * kof* ".Â 
I suppose in one sense, the understated reaction by Cersei is understandable - a straight out "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO" would have seemed like cheese.
2882	Queen of Whores	2014-04-14	Yeah, you're right, I think it was Alister.

Yeah it was Alester, Selyse's uncle. He was burned because he tried to marry Shireen to Tommen without Stannis' knowledge or consent. Axell still lives and continues to be an asshole to Jon at the Wall.
2883	Robbie Hood	2014-04-14	Joffery's death scene started off a bit stage school, but by the end it paid off so well, the make up and his contorted face, very effective.
Only disappointment was not hearing a Cersei scream, then again, she's not Catlyn Stark is she?
2884	The Kinkslayer	2014-04-14	I thought I was going to miss Pretty Pig and the Dancing bear, but 5 dwarfs as 5 kings was awesome. The only thing I didn't like about the jousting was Tyrion's response to Joffrey, it lacked the strength of 'I'll fight you, because you are the only man in this wedding that I'm certain of defeating'
Â 
I think we all can agree that no Coldhands and the Dragonstone scenes were the weak points of the episode, Stannis didn't even clench his teeth once.
Â 
Pointless burning of infidels (Stannis isn't sailing to the wall yet) was pretty anti-climatic for Stannis, whom just won the war of the 5 kings by default (Show Balon is still alive, but nobody cares about him). Also, the Florents claim to descent from the Kings of house Gardener, so Melisandre just wasted some of that valued King's blood.

2885	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-14	Wasn't sold on Cersei's reactions here.Â 
Â 
I did like her kicking her dog (Pycelle) only to be kicked in turn by the Red Viper.... but otherwise I just wasn't sold - especially how she reacted as the death went down.
2886	Metopheles	2014-04-14	Oh, forgot, now we finally saw Daenerys' dragon scene 
Â 
All this freakout about it in the trailer, now we know.
Now we actually know more than from the books. She will come to KL. At least a dragon.Â 
That scene was so amazing, the whole vision.
2887	Envie	2014-04-14	Â 
Â 
The scene had to be a bit more "visual" than the books, I guess. Less Cersei screaming, less "I want you to ride the pig, uncle *kof* * kof* ".Â 
I suppose in one sense, the understated reaction by Cersei is understandable - a straight out "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO" would have seemed like cheese.


Â 
Â 
It's true - Cersei screaming would probably be a lot less believable than the amazingly heart wrenching scream Catelyn gave when Robb was killed. Cersei's nothing like that at all and some things just don't translate well onto the screen. I think they split the scene in two as someone linked the promo for next week and Cersei's definitely freaking out in the second half of that - at least raging at Tyrion anyways.Â
2888	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-14	No "I'm familiar with Valyrian steel" moment. Bit disappointed about that.
Â 
Otherwise, nothing else bothered me.
2889	Dragon's Bane	2014-04-14	Jaime is already in King's Landing and messed up protecting the King.
Brienne is already in King's Landing and the Tyrells seem to love her.
I would have loved little more than actually seeing two dwarven jousters on a pig and a dog respectively. But I guess they translated it to 'doable on TV' rather well.
Ilyn. Not Bronn. Ilyn. I've read about the reasoning, but still... Does this mean no Lord Stokeworth? Or no sight seeing tour of the nicest castles in the Riverlands for Jaime and Ilyn/Bronn?
Shae. Everything about Shae in that episode. It really seems to come down to Tyrion being a dick to her, mixed with pressure from Tywin so she has understandable reasons for betraying him in the magnitude we all know of.
And of course Stannis being shown as a religious fanatic.
2890	Mark Antony	2014-04-14	I know people say Emilia Clarke or Kit Harrington are the worst actors on the series (I'd say they're both mediocre and extremely inconsistent) but Shaes actress is just the worst by far. Always terrible in every scene. I was laughing at her and Tyrions fight. Gods I can't wait for her to die.
Â 
Didn't like Sansa not being active in her escape.
2891	The Killer Snark	2014-04-14	I have many reservations. See my review of the episode. Most are forgivable, but the cop-out resolution of the Tyrion/Shae arc was an absolute catastrophe and seemed to be patronising non-reading viewers by assuming they wouldn't reach a proper moral conclusion, against Tywin, which keeping the real ending of their situation would have caused. To finish things between them this way makes her seem like a superfluous character at King's Landing all this time, if indeed she managed safely to get on board the ship.
Â 
The dialogue between Jaime and Joffers was neat in ep 1, but it doesn't really work that he's already at King's Landing. In the novels, part of what drives Cersei further off the deep end is his desire to join the Kingsguard and abstain from her bedroom after he returns past the death of Jofrey, and leaves her with one less person to be close to. He would never have cared to protect Joffrey anyway. And the show made it too obvious who was partly to blame for her son's end.
Â 
The Dreadfort scenes were good, but I reckon Theon at that point would still have had enough of himself left to slit Ramsay's throat with that razor after hearing of Robb's death, even if the episode was written by GRR Martin. He does think to himself he should have died with Robb at the Red Wedding in the fifth novel, after all.

Â 
I haven't been as harsh a critic on the actress portraying Shae as others have all these seasons even though I didn't really like her that much. But this scene, she definitely over-acted. I could tell Tyrion was being mean just for effect - to pull it off and send her away by pretending he didn't want her anymore. He's trying to save her life. But the part that lost me was Shae's sobbing. It was so fake! I didn't like that. It would have been better for her to have kept a poker face and still slapped Bronn than to be sobbing that way. Blargh.
2893	Knight of Ashes	2014-04-14	My nItpIck is they should've laid off "Rains of Castamere" until they reach the privy-related show. What're they gonna play then, 'The Bear and the Maiden Fair"?

2894	Metopheles	2014-04-14	How are Clarke Harington and Kekilli bad actors ? Harington sometimes seems weird, but because he is different from bookJon. But Shae ?
And this comes from people who praise Jack Gleeson. This guy is a horrible actor ever since season 3.
2895	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-04-14	D&D just turn a blind eye to Stannis' character. They should just forget about him and kill him next season early, if they hate him that bad.Â
2896	SuperTechmarine	2014-04-14	Stannis ruined. again. again.
Â 
Joffrey isn't tearing at his throat, but fuck his face...jesus. Blood pouring out of his nose, his eyes go red, his face...god. No Cersei scream though. And why did Jaime run to his side? He gives zero fucks about his son.
2897	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-14	Stannis ruined. again. again.

Because he's Commander of the Kingsguard?

Agre agree agree especially at the Stannis thing. That was unworthy.
Â 
Jaime rushing to him .. ahem commander of the guard ? And being mocked by everyone for failing with the other kings and because of his previous absence ? Just because he doesn't care about Joff, does not mean he does not care about his job. Last episode he was so desperate to keeping the job, why would he go now "oh fuck no"?
I think the issue is that he is there before the thing. In the books he arrived after that. He would have done the same thing.
2899	Roose Seal	2014-04-14	If Loras and Oberyn have a thing I'm going to lose my shit.
2900	The Kinkslayer	2014-04-14	My nItpIck is they should've laid off "Rains of Castamere" until they reach the privy-related show. What're they gonna play then, 'The Bear and the Maiden Fair"?


What about the Dornishman's wife or 'hands of gold are always cold â<U+0099>«'?
2901	Federico	2014-04-14	My negative  nitpicks dwell mostly on character departures than mere story ones.
The motive for burning the Florents had too much to do with religious intolerance, which contrasts with book Stannis, and oversimplifies him.  
They've turned his wife from a vane high born in the books to a wide eyed zealot.
Bran acted like a moody bitch instead of the smitten, determined boy.  Not a big concern though....yet.
Mace has been immasculated by his mother.  It's a wonder Mace could do anything she opposes.  This contrast will grow.
Cersei's 'you love him' point seemed inadequately founded from Cersei's PoV.  But this was consistent with her book character anyway.
Well, you might think I hated the episode.  Nope!  I loved it.  The departures gives readers such as me a flow of the unexpected, which is exciting.  Many story departures are clever and fun.  The character departures concern me.
Fed
2902	Chebyshov	2014-04-14	I was so bummed out they didn't have Tyrion reference the dagger after Joff destroyed his book. Are we just going to assume show-watchers don't care about Bran's assassination attempt, or they just assume it was Cersei or Jaime and leave it there?

Speaking of daggers, I was expecting to hear about a certain knight with a hole in his hand exhibiting signs of being poisoned.
2904	Roose Seal	2014-04-14	Oh wow yes, I blocked out the Cersei/Brienne scene. Wtf was that.
They're gonna make Brienne interact with everyone in King's Landing except the two people she actuallyÂ should interact with: Sansa and Loras.
Next week, Brienne chats about the weather with Ilyn Payne and sleeps with Sex God Pod.

I actually liked Cersei's confrontation, but yeah, when Brienne first approached the table I'm thinking "Finally, she gets to meet Sansa!". Unfortunately no, pretty disappointed about that.
2908	Metopheles	2014-04-14	To the Coldhands fanatics..
I don't believe he will be showing up, but at the end of Bran's vision, the "healthy" horse... maybe they actually do use this as Coldhands. Doubt it highly, but wanted to point out.
Â 
Maybe thy bring up the dagger thing while Tyrion is in the cells. There are plenty of episodes until the Viper and the Mountain and so they might use it a bit later on.
Â 
Same goes for Brienne.

2909	Kings Wood Outlaw	2014-04-14	It was Ser Adam Marbrand who trains w/Kingslayer to develop his left hand followed by tongueless Ser Illyn not Bronn
2910	Metopheles	2014-04-14	Tommen the hormone monster.
Seriously, he got through puberty pretty quick. Seems Cersei gave him some good nutrition.
He aged faster than Bran
2911	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-14	While the scenes at the wedding were good and added to the characters, the sequence of Jaime/Loras, Cersei/Brienne and Oberyn/Tywin and Cersei felt a bit too much in a row in the way of people subtly insulting each other and hinting at things. All of the scenes were well done, granted, but it started to feel like everyone just insulting each other in a subtle way. More to break up those scenes in the middle would have been nice, because they were all good scenes but very similar in approach.

2914	Conchobar	2014-04-14	How could Ramsay trust Reek enough to razor shave his neck? Doesn't Reek want to die anyway? What has he to lose? All he has to do is slice Ramsay's neck and then death and an end to his suffering.

Â 
The point is that Ramsay knows Reek is completely and utterly obedient of him. Reek wouldn't mind death, but if he's got a chance to remain alive then he'll take it.
2916	pwnt	2014-04-14	I think it's not death that dissuades Reek, but the prospect of more, even nastier torture.

Wilko Johnson has pancreatic cancer, refused chemo and was given 9 month to live Jan 2013 - hes still around but I think the rigours of sword fighting with Jamie might have been too much for him.

Where some actors could be replaced without too much grief like Daario and the Mountain...no actor could replaceÂ Ilyn's face.Â 
Â 
If none of you have ever seen Wilko Johnson in action google/tube Dr Feelgood - hes particularly good on Roxette, never seen a bass player move like it, brilliant guitarist with a play style many others try to emulate but cant.

I don't know. Maybe they keep the baby at the Wall to have more tension and suspense. More Stannis hate. All unsullied would fear about Stannis to burn the fella.
But then, the episode will be extremely cramped I guess, as in a set piece or the foreshadowing we saw some scenes with Jon and Sam, so this episode will be quite Jon focused. and quite fast. Like it though, that they push Sam into the AFFC territory. Makes for a more darker season and hopefully a great ending with Aemon finally showing some decent background info which they left out in the show all the time.
Â 
Kinda interesting that the major point that is being criticized is the writing. Don't like this interactions, don't like this change, yet this is the episode written by GRRM himself.
2920	Nakraal	2014-04-14	Excellent episode as always.
My sole complaint is the reaction of Cercei and Jaime while Joff was joking (not after they got his dead)
Â 
I would prefer to see them put their fingers in his mouth in a desperate effort to make him breath - or smthing in these lines, rather than just watching him die.

I'd be surprised if tracheotomies were commonplace in Westeros. But at least in the books someone thudded on his back. Here they just kind of huddled and were like "oh no!"

Â 
And, just kill her already because I can't stand noble, heroic, loving, superwoman Shae. At all.

It was also kind of bad that Brienne is at the wedding and never talks to Sansa? Â Oh really? Â That doesn't seem like a Brienne move, they should have just left her out of it entirely.

It look like the series let that go because when Pycelle made the reference to valyrion steel, Joffrey was supposed to say "I've handled valyrion steel before".Â  He didn't.

Brienne sucking up to the Tyrells

Loras coy and making eyes at OberynÂ Â Â  book Loras wasn't a cheap lay--when the sun has set...

2930	darndes	2014-04-14	It's been a few years since I read the books, so maybe I'm off, but I seem to remember that when Tywin presents Joff with the sword on his wedding day, Sansa immediately recognizes the steel that the sword came from and gets unnerved at that, and Tyrion reflects on how he should have had the sword sent back with Ned's bones. Â Sophie does such a great job at portraying Sansa's inner torment, that it would have been nice to have seen this little bit included in the episode...
Â 
Also, since they appear to be including later books into this season, that scene with Ramsay and Bolton would have been perfect to include the Bolton line "Don't make me rue the day..................." Â  Would have loved for him to have included that!
2931	mafalda	2014-04-14	Although this episode had its good moments, I have four gripes:
Â 
*Stannis. Everything about this scene was awful, even if I do like shireen.Â 
Â 
*Cersei's reaction to Joff's death. I have never liked Lena Heady as Cersei, for looks and for acting. Her reaction was just so wooden, she didn't cry or mourn. She immediately went from shock to anger. Maybe it has a lot to do with direction, because I also hated Cat's reaction to Robb's death last season.Â 
Â 
*Shae and Tyrion! So they're setting it up to where Shae would have a "reason" for betraying Tyrion? Like so many changes D&D make, I just don't understand why! What's the reasoning behind it?Â 
Â 
*Jaime. This is my biggest gripe about the entire season so far, is that he and Brienne are in KL way too early! So they have all of these made up, pointless interactions that go nowhere. Jaime is supposed to be on his path to redemption, and they keep screwing with that (like how they had him kill his own cousin in S2). Hated how it was him who tried to initiate with Cersei, and that is was Cersei who turned him down. And Jaime has said before that he basically doesn't care about his kids, so for hi to have that reaction to Joff's death was dumb. After Joff tried him last week with the hand comment, then what he said about the book, I just KNEW they were going to have Jaime stand by and do nothing while Joff died. They even showed Jaime rolling his eyes at Joff's behavior at the reception. So for them to have Jaime run up and try to act likes he cares was dumb. For those saying "it's because he's in the KG", I say, none of the other KG helped, and if that was true he would have called him "your Grace" instead off "Joffrey". I'm gonna quote another user on here when I say that Jaime gives zero fucks about his son and it should have stayed that way.Â
2932	Chebyshov	2014-04-14	social was meant sarcastically


Â 
Lol, alright then...it's always hard to tell in forums. Her scene with Cersei was really cringe-worthy, and not a great addition. People already were shipping Jaime/Brienne. Making it explicit was just painful.
2933	JesterX	2014-04-14	Would opening up his neck at the point where his air vent is not have saved him actually? Or would they not have known how to do that in the time period this is based on?


Â 
I believe the poison they used also closes the airways in the LUNGS, not just the throat, so I doubt if a tracheotomy would've helped Joff.
2934	Cas Stark	2014-04-14	Â 
Lol, alright then...it's always hard to tell in forums. Her scene with Cersei was really cringe-worthy, and not a great addition. People already were shipping Jaime/Brienne. Making it explicit was just painful.


Â 
They make so many odd choices, you know? Â Why waste time on such a strange scene, that doesn't have any emotional impact when they could have had Brienne talk to Sansa? Â Or give a little more time to the Red Viper/Tywin encounter. Â
2935	JesterX	2014-04-14	I think Bronn isÂ betrayed Tyrion and gave Shae to the Queen.Â  Cause we know he's not going to champion Tyrion in his trial.Â  However, the show has setup the Bronn/Tyrion relationship as a pretty close friendship.Â  So the only way Bronn would NOT champion Tyrion is if he betrays him.
2936	Enmity	2014-04-14	*Purple Wedding
-Tywin in 3 different shots smiling at the Dwarfs jousting then looking pissed off.
-When Joff collapses on the floor there's some random kingsguard knight behind Tyrion guarding a table or whatever the hell he's doing is beyond me.
-No one turning around when Joff pours wine on Tyrion.
Â 
*Stannis Scene
-I don't feel like he would be the person to complain about food when he survived a siege for months on rats.
-Everything just felt random, aren't they supposed to be gearing up for the Wall?
2937	SerJeremiahLouistark	2014-04-14	My issue is with Locke/Vargo Hoat.  I guess it's a non issue issue but since Locke is taking Hoat's place, we can only assume that his demise will not take place the same way, especially seeing him entering the Dreadfort with Roose.  
Anyone have any ideas or clues as to how Locke will meet his maker?  If he even ever does?
2938	kacunnin	2014-04-14	The Shae/Tryion thing bothered me.Â  I know "show Shae" is very different from "book Shae" (she's an opportunist in the books, but it's a full-fledged love story in the show), but they seem to be trying to manipulate things so that Tryion can still kill Shae.Â  And I don't see how that will work.
Â 
First, the whole breakup thing was a soap opera trope -- the hero cruelly breaks it off with his lady love in order to protect her from his ruthless enemies (anyone who has ever watched a daytime soap will know exactly what I'm talking about).Â  Shae should have been smart enough to call Tyrion on it, but no -- she played her soapy role perfectly, by breaking down sobbing.Â  Yikes!
Â 
Now I'm guessing Cersei's men have Shae in custody (the spy thing in last week's episode would have been pointless otherwise), and she'll be pressured into testifying against Tyrion.Â  But would she really go so far as to cavort with Tywin for a gold necklace?Â  Even if she's mad at Tyrion, she still loves him (in the show at least -- in the books, I totally believed her change of allegiance).
Â 
If Tyrion kills her -- after setting up her betrayal himself! -- I don't think I'll have much sympathy for him.Â  The show hasn't really developed Tyrion's obsessive focus on Tysha and how he was played for a fool by his brother and his father (at least that's the story he has always belived).Â  In the books, it's because of Tysha (who he thinks was a whore) that he never fully trusts Shae -- he is always reminding himself of who she is and what she does for a living.Â  It's supposed to be Jaime's revelation that Tysha really was an innocent girl that prompts his murderous actions agains Tywin.Â  I'm not sure that will fly here.Â 
Â 
The show made the decision to turn the Tyrion/Shae relationship into a real romance, and now they're trying to come up with some pretext to allow Tyrion to kill her.Â  There IS no pretext.Â  And if he does kill her, it could undermine his character for non-readers.Â
2939	Queen Sansa Stark	2014-04-14	My issue is how Sansa didn't know beforehand she was supposed to escape. The little agency she had was removed from her and it turned her into an object. It seems that subtlety of Sansa's character goes beyond them.Â
2940	Metopheles	2014-04-14	Â 
-I don't feel like he would be the person to complain about food when he survived a siege for months on rats.
Â 


I think it was because he just roasted a man. Now he smells cooked meat.. Would get my stomach upset..

Brienne being besties with Marg.
2942	Er Rn	2014-04-14	I think it was because he just roasted a man. Now he smells cooked meat.. Would get my stomach upset..

That's the way I took it too.
2943	JesterX	2014-04-14	Hey, they completely forgot about Loras and Brienne.Â  They were both at the wedding.Â  They seemed to forgot about him blaming her for Renly.
2944	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-14	I think Bronn isÂ betrayed Tyrion and gave Shae to the Queen.Â  Cause we know he's not going to champion Tyrion in his trial.Â  However, the show has setup the Bronn/Tyrion relationship as a pretty close friendship.Â  So the only way Bronn would NOT champion Tyrion is if he betrays him.


Â 
I don't see how that's the "only way". He'll refuse to champion for Tyrion because, despite their friendship, he's still a selfish sellsword who will see himself in a better situation to avoid the duel altogether.
Â 
As far as betrayal goes, Bronn said he was followed; and he/they believe it was Varys because he was in on the plan. But we know that Tywin ordered Shae to be taken after Cersei pointed her out to him at the breakfast feast. So while Bronn thinks she safely on her way across the sea, I think it's a fair enough estimate to make that Cersei's men seized her before she got away.
2945	Zoe_H	2014-04-14	Hey, they completely forgot about Loras and Brienne.Â  They were both at the wedding.Â  They seemed to forgot about him blaming her for Renly.


Â 
Show Loras already admitted in season 2 that Brienne couldn't have been responsible for Renly's death.
2946	Veltigar	2014-04-14	How could Ramsay trust Reek enough to razor shave his neck? Doesn't Reek want to die anyway? What has he to lose? All he has to do is slice Ramsay's neck and then death and an end to his suffering.


Yeah, I hated that scene as well. In the books I might have bought it, but the show has done such a poor job at breaking Theon down that it just doesn't feel like something he would do.
2947	Metopheles	2014-04-14	There is still plenty of time for a Loras and Brienne scene to happen. And what people forget that I miss : Jaime's entry in the White Book. But I am optimistic this will come.
Give the show some time. And allow changes. They keep so many dialogues word for word, it is sometimes as if you could just speak it yourself. And this book is now some years old, Martin may have wanted some changes himself, or thought what he could have done different or better.
Â 
If you want a 1:1 adaptation, go to a Faust play or Shakespeare. They usually keep everything.Â
2948	Jojosh	2014-04-14	I really hated that Theon/Ramsay scene. In a realistic reek persona theon would have cut his own throat or cut Ramsay's
2949	Cyril	2014-04-14	The directors couldn't sell Jaime and BrienneÂ  being in King's Landing; I was willing to give the decision a chance, but the more I see the more I think it was a horrible idea.Â  I understand it from a dramatic perspective at the end of last season, to give Jaime's story a sense of closure, but it feels like a lack of foresight and dawdling.Â  They could have ended storyline with Jaime and Brienne riding into the sunset after the bear scene, or something.
Â 
The only decent scene to come out of this decision was Tryion and Jaime, which I do think was quite well done.

Â 
I don't think Cersei/Tywin's men would've needed to be that stealthy to tail Bronn, wait till he's gone, then whisk Shae away.Â  They would've just killed Bronn and taken Shae.Â  And Varys is the one who arranged the ship, he wouldn't have needed to follow Bronn.Â  He could've just waited for him at the ship.Â  But I think you're right about Bronn refusing to champion Tyrion.Â  That wouldn't necessarily be a betrayal.

2955	Conchobar	2014-04-14	I really hated that Theon/Ramsay scene. In a realistic reek persona theon would have cut his own throat or cut Ramsay's


I thought that too, and still do. BUT! I think Theon is just afraid that if he killed Ramsay he would be subject to more torture. That doesn't make much sense though, if he has the razor, he could open up his own throat, and if he killed Ramsay he could just make the Bolton men kill him if he defended himself with the razor.Â 
Â 
Â 




My issue is with Locke/Vargo Hoat. I guess it's a non issue issue but since Locke is taking Hoat's place, we can only assume that his demise will not take place the same way, especially seeing him entering the Dreadfort with Roose.
Anyone have any ideas or clues as to how Locke will meet his maker? If he even ever does?

What he said was that he wouldn't LIE to Tywin or Cersei.Â  He was willing to go against them by keeping Shae a secret from them in the first place.
2962	Janicia	2014-04-14	Sending Gilly and her baby south with Sam makes sense in the storyline of the show.Â  Gilly is not a member of the Nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Watch and has no business being at the wall during a battle.Â  Sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a distraction, an extra mouth to feed, and a possible security risk.Â  If these were normal times, she probably would have been sent to settle somewhere in the North.Â  Since these are not normal times, sending her off with Sam makes as much sense as anything else.Â 
Â 
Brienneâ<U+0080><U+0099>s scenes with everybody but Jaime this season come across as stilted to me.Â  I know Brienne is awkward and unsure what to do with herself, and thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s coming across, but theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re not enjoyable scenes for me to watch.Â 
Â 
Tyrionâ<U+0080><U+0099>s realization about the dagger and Branâ<U+0080><U+0099>s assassin was one of my favorite points in the books, and it is disappointing that the show may never reveal that Joffrey sent the assassin, but I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t see how it could possibly have worked on TV.Â  For one thing, that played out in Tyrionâ<U+0080><U+0099>s head but in the show it would have to be dialogue.Â  I could imagine Tyrion talking about it with Varys, but not at the wedding.Â 
Â 
I was sad that Sansa didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t murmur to Tyrion about the sword, but the show did show her reacting to it, as well as reacting to Joffreyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s comment about â<U+0080><U+009C>cutting Nedâ<U+0080><U+0099>s head off every time he uses itâ<U+0080><U+009D>.Â  I felt that show Sansa was aware that the sword had been created from Nedâ<U+0080><U+0099>s sword.
Â 
I really hope that Bolton uses the â<U+0080><U+009C>rue the dayâ<U+0080><U+009D> line at some point.Â Â  It would have worked in this episode.
2963	Loras Stan	2014-04-14	Â 
I must've missed that.Â  You know which episode?


Â 
I don't remember the episode number, but he mentions it when he's mourning over Renly's body. He puts the blame soley on Stannis. I think Margaery is the one who mentions Brienne, and Loras is all 'nope had to be Stannis.'.

Â 
The windpipe is not a muscle, it's just a tube.Â  It can't be paralyzed.Â  Maybe the poison paralyzes the diaphragm, which controls breathing.Â  But my understanding of the poison was that it closed ALL airways, including the ones in the lungs themselves.
Â 
Edit:Â  Either way, the net effect is you're right.Â  A tracheotomy wouldn't have helped Joffrey.

2967	Bini	2014-04-14	Oh, forgot, now we finally saw Daenerys' dragon scene 
Â 
All this freakout about it in the trailer, now we know.
Now we actually know more than from the books. She will come to KL. At least a dragon.Â 
That scene was so amazing, the whole vision.


Not so sure about this being a spoiler, at all. Bran saw stuff from the past in that vision (Eddard).
That may very well be one of the Targaryen dragons of old (yes, Aegon also founded King's Landing in the show). And if/when Daenerys goes to KL, it will already be winter. That scene certainly does not look like it's winter in KL.
Â 
The burning of Axell Florent for religious reasons was ridiculous. I was not bothered by the change from Alester to Axell, but what bad could come of explaining that the guy was intent on bending the knee to Joffrey and that makes him a traitor who therefore should be executioned?Â 

					
					
							Edited by Bini, 14 April 2014 - 09:57 AM.
2968	VladimirDulud	2014-04-14	My biggest nitpick was that I felt like they rushed all of the scenes before the final purple wedding. Maybe it's just me over anticipating the famous death of Joffrey but all the other scenes felt rushed and somewhat scattered all over the place. I think they tried to cram too many different plots into that first 30 minutes and sadly some of them needed more detail.
Â 
The scene with Reek shaving Ramsay was probably the best of them all and the only one I felt wasn't rushed. It was perfection. The tension in the room at that moment the blade was paused on his jugular when Ramsay told him Robb Stark was dead....absolutely priceless.
Â 
Like many others, I didn't like the Stannis / Selyse / Melisandre scenes at all... they felt wrong, disjointed and confusing. I know the forums are going to explode with all the Stannis 'character assassination' threads, but my gads they did sorta muck up that whole story line in this one.
Â 
When the final scene came and Joffrey lay dead - I felt some disappointment. I'm not exactly sure why yet. I rewatched it and felt the actors all did a great job and even though the whole thing felt 'stilted' - that's fitting with how awkward and tense the entire thing was in the books as well. I can't really say why I was disappointed. Maybe I expected more drama from Cersei or others looking on while Joffrey choked to death. I will say the graphic way they did his face more than made up for a lot of my disappointment with the lead up to it.


Â 
I would have liked to see more details - food, props, scenery, etc. - I know it was a lavish production, but I felt like it went by too quickly. I think the episode should have been entirely about the wedding.

Â 
And now what? Â She is sooo hurt that he called her a whore she turns on him? Â

I'm totally back, after a tiny window of belief they might have Tyrion kill her, that Tywin will do it, and this will then make his father killing TOTALLY justified for the audience.

2985	Roose Seal	2014-04-14	The treatment of Shae as a character and the her relationship with Tyrion is so ridiculous. At this point, I wouldn't be surprised if Tyrion doesn't in fact kill her. If that happens, I will be immensely pissed.
Also, I'm starting to think they should've killed off Stannis in Blackwater, regardless of what his role will ultimately be in the books.
His arc on the show just isn't working, at all.
It feels completely disconnected from the rest (probably even more so than Dany's storyline) and it's painfully obvious they don't really wanna make any effort to make that set of characters interesting.
With little screentime she has, Shireen manages to be more intriguing and interesting than the rest of Dragonstone.
The amount of time wasted on inconsequential scenes (Brienne/Cersei) is especially annoying when you know they could spend that time on nuancing the main characters.

And more dishes, 7 versions of the rains of castamere and a dancing bear.
Â 


Not sure where the show is going with Myranda, hope she doesn't replace Ramsay's Bastard's Boys.Â  I wonder if she'll be used to replace Jeyne Poole.


Princess Merida is too old to pass for Arya
2996	Narishma Reborn	2014-04-14	No "I'm familiar with Valyrian steel" moment. Bit disappointed about that.
Â 
Otherwise, nothing else bothered me.


Â  THIS so much this. Looks like they are dropping this point from the books completely.Â  I'll miss it for sure, but I loved that reveal.
2997	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-04-14	One of the biggest challenges with the show is the geographic disbursement of its many characters. Â We finally have a large number of them all in the same place - why is every single #%$ing scene still 2 people talking to each other, smash cut to 2 other people talking to each other, smash cut to 2 other people talking to each other?!?
2998	channamasala	2014-04-14	Â 
The windpipe is not a muscle, it's just a tube.Â  It can't be paralyzed.Â  Maybe the poison paralyzes the diaphragm, which controls breathing.Â  But my understanding of the poison was that it closed ALL airways, including the ones in the lungs themselves.
Â 
Edit:Â  Either way, the net effect is you're right.Â  A tracheotomy wouldn't have helped Joffrey.


Â 
Seeing as he also had a bleeding nose and red eyes, I'm guessing it did more than paralyze his breathing apparatus. I'm no poison expert, but it seemed to me something had to have also been going on in his skull for that to happen.
2999	MyLittleDirewolf	2014-04-14	Brienne - I love Gwendoline Christie and her portrayal of Brienne, and have been fairly happy with the show's version of her. However, the "I'm no lady" stuff kinda bugs. Brienne is very much a believer in chivalry and proper titles and manners. She wouldn't have a problem being addressed as Lady Brienne, that is her title. I don't recall her ever chiding someone for saying My Lady or Lady Brienne, Lady Tarth, etc. The bow instead of a curtsey was fine, Brienne is awkward.
3000	SerJeremiahLouistark	2014-04-14	I loved the episode, but they are making complicated, grey characters into simple black and white.
1. Loras - does everyone with homosexual inclinations in Westeros automatic hit on every other person with similar tendencies? Sigh. Stereotypical sex-crazed crappola with no depth or nuance.
2. Ramsey-Roose. Roose does not care that his bastard is a psychopath; he is one himself. He just takes issue with how flamboyant he is about it lol. And Ramsey desperately craving his father's acceptance is lame.
3. Stannis and crew. Just run-of-the-mill apocalyptic fundies? Really?
4. Shae. As mentioned above, thanks for the pathetic soap opera arc. Hard-ass, calculating survivor Shae is now Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman. Wtf.

Regarding Loras it did give him a nice line to Jamie when he patted him on the shoulder and told Jamie he wouldn't ever marry Cersei either, I thought that was comical.
3001	Oakenfist	2014-04-14	Roose Bolton getting through the Neck was the only thing I disliked. I feel like George plays around with geography a lot in the books, but in the show they're even worse at it. I can understand the change but I don't like it seeing as how the Neck is supposedly impenetrable from the South.
3002	W1NT3RF3LL	2014-04-14	I think Bronn isÂ betrayed Tyrion and gave Shae to the Queen.Â  Cause we know he's not going to champion Tyrion in his trial.Â  However, the show has setup the Bronn/Tyrion relationship as a pretty close friendship.Â  So the only way Bronn would NOT champion Tyrion is if he betrays him.I still dont see how bron betrayed him in the books.  It just seemed as though bron knew he was going to lose so he took the deal that was presented to him.
3003	protar	2014-04-14	My big nitpick with the episode - What on earth was that lion head? It looked like something from an amusement park, not medieval at all.
3004	jblair	2014-04-14	Regarding Loras it did give him a nice line to Jamie when he patted him on the shoulder and told Jamie he wouldn't ever marry Cersei either, I thought that was comical.

Yes that line was a terrific addition.
3005	Chebyshov	2014-04-14	My big nitpick with the episode - What on earth was that lion head? It looked like something from an amusement park, not medieval at all.


Â 
Agreed! I thought it was a moonbounce for the kids or something.
Â 
Also completely random, but I really hate their casual wardrobe for characters. I thought Roose's outfit was far too modern looking.
3006	aFeastForDragons	2014-04-14	Theon having all his fingers even though his pinkie was flayed. I half noticed it in the episode but now that someone confirmed it I'm kind of annoyed about it,.
3007	Gneisenau	2014-04-14	I found it funny that Stannis was riding a Melissandre mount
3008	Stormland's Fury	2014-04-14	My big nitpick with the episode - What on earth was that lion head? It looked like something from an amusement park, not medieval at all.


Â This.
Â 
And Stannis saying "Infidels".
3009	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-04-14	No Black Gate and no Coldhands was the disappointment of the episode. Everything else I was cool with, but removin' the former two was a lame choice.

3010	TheFullmetalAlchemist	2014-04-14	I imagined the royal wedding would have had more guests.Â 


^this. The whole thing felt like a very quiet, subdued affair unlike the books.Â
3011	Raksha 2014	2014-04-14	Although this episode had its good moments, I have four gripes:
Â 
*Stannis. Everything about this scene was awful, even if I do like shireen.Â 
Â 
*Cersei's reaction to Joff's death. I have never liked Lena Heady as Cersei, for looks and for acting. Her reaction was just so wooden, she didn't cry or mourn. She immediately went from shock to anger. Maybe it has a lot to do with direction, because I also hated Cat's reaction to Robb's death last season.Â 
Â 
*Shae and Tyrion! So they're setting it up to where Shae would have a "reason" for betraying Tyrion? Like so many changes D&D make, I just don't understand why! What's the reasoning behind it?Â 
Â 
*Jaime. This is my biggest gripe about the entire season so far, is that he and Brienne are in KL way too early! So they have all of these made up, pointless interactions that go nowhere. Jaime is supposed to be on his path to redemption, and they keep screwing with that (like how they had him kill his own cousin in S2). Hated how it was him who tried to initiate with Cersei, and that is was Cersei who turned him down. And Jaime has said before that he basically doesn't care about his kids, so for hi to have that reaction to Joff's death was dumb. After Joff tried him last week with the hand comment, then what he said about the book, I just KNEW they were going to have Jaime stand by and do nothing while Joff died. They even showed Jaime rolling his eyes at Joff's behavior at the reception. So for them to have Jaime run up and try to act likes he cares was dumb. For those saying "it's because he's in the KG", I say, none of the other KG helped, and if that was true he would have called him "your Grace" instead off "Joffrey". I'm gonna quote another user on here when I say that Jaime gives zero fucks about his son and it should have stayed that way.Â 


Â 
Â 
For me, actually, Jaime's run to Joffrey's side was moving, and gave the only pathos to Joffrey's death; because for whatever reasons, Lena Headey's performance was off, as you noted. Â I saw Jaime's action, and his calling Joffrey's name as he ran, as his reaction to his nephew's plight, to the terrible danger in which his beloved sister's son was in, rather than the concern of a father or Kingsguard. Â Jaime was, after all, a Lannister, and this boy was not only a Lannister, he was the firstborn of the person Jaime has loved most in all his life.
3012	jons nissa	2014-04-14	Â 



If Loras and Oberyn have a thing I'm going to lose my shit.


Â 
and yet there's a lot pointing to it happening. i think it would make for an interesting scene. perhaps for sharing exposition and plans?
3013	HelenaExMachina	2014-04-14	Bronn claims to fuck the wife of Beric Dondarrion; i.e. the lord with the lightning bolt on his shield
3014	jons nissa	2014-04-14	Â 



Reek has too many fingers.Â 
There's a close up of his hands during the shaving scene.
He definitely has every finger on his right hand (continuity error- Ramsay cut off the pinkie last season).
Seems to have all on his left hand too.


Â 
i did wonder about how normal his hands looked. and welcome! Â  
Â 
Â 


What was this bit about "Not a queen-regent anymore after the wedding"? What does the wedding has to do with whether Cersei is the regent. IIRC on the show he hasn't been a regent for a while.


Â 
i was confused by that as well since joff is presumably still underage whether married or not so would still require a regent. the line should have been not queen anymore although i'm not sure if she still held that title anymore either if joff was already king.
3015	JesterX	2014-04-14	I still dont see how bron betrayed him in the books. It just seemed as though bron knew he was going to lose so he took the deal that was presented to him.


Â 
Not in the books.Â  I think on the show Bronn took Shae to Cersei/Tywin's peopleÂ and not the ship.
3016	David Selig	2014-04-14	i was confused by that as well since joff is presumably still underage whether married or not so would still require a regent. the line should have been not queen anymore although i'm not sure if she still held that title anymore either if joff was already king.

I think he mentions someone else, but I could be mistaken
3018	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-14	I think he mentions someone else, but I could be mistaken


Â 
My subtitles said Lord Leygood, a house from the Reach with thunderbolts. So it's all canon. Except the Bronn fuckÂ  
Â 
So, nitpicks:
Â 
Cersei and Brienne, too obvious and kind of teen novelish for me. Felt like shipper bait too
Â 
Tywin and Cersei vs Oberyn and Ellaria: Good dialogue, but again, felt like way too direct for me (still it was in character for Oberyn and Cersei, I think)
Â 
Tommen looks too old!
Â 
Enough with Mel burning infildels, that was just Sunglass and Rambton. They should have said Axell (I guess that was him) Florent was a traitor planning to go all Operation Valkyrie on Stannis' ass
3019	Loerwyn	2014-04-14	Brienne - I love Gwendoline Christie and her portrayal of Brienne, and have been fairly happy with the show's version of her. However, the "I'm no lady" stuff kinda bugs. Brienne is very much a believer in chivalry and proper titles and manners. She wouldn't have a problem being addressed as Lady Brienne, that is her title. I don't recall her ever chiding someone for saying My Lady or Lady Brienne, Lady Tarth, etc. The bow instead of a curtsey was fine, Brienne is awkward.


Yes, this. We know Brienne does resent her title to some degree (more due to what it represents to other people rather than as a comment on her sex), but she does act as a knight, not a lady at court. She doesn't curtsey, she doesn't make small talk, she is at home with the men, and that's kinda why she's so awesome. She's a woman who fights and knows it and relishes in it. But... eugh, yeah.
Â 
So, what did I hate?
Â 
1. The camera work. It's getting worse and worse and worse and I'm finding it almost unbearable at times now, not to mention at times it seems as if it's being filmed via Instagram.
Â 
2. Cersei. Her comments to Brienne were utterly pointless and unwarranted, although her comment about Renly does kind of show that she's grasping at straws and getting desparate as she loses power. But there's better ways to handle it than... that. And yes, we know there's sexual tension between Jaime and Brienne. It does NOT need to be stated in such a blunt, stupid way.
Â 
3. 1+2 combined here for the utterly awful and unnecessary shots down Cersei's dress as Joff the Toff dies in her arms. No. Just no. No. NO.
Â 
4. Not enough Lady Olenna
Â 
5. Whilst I'm Team Stannis, I find his scenes utterly bizarre. Sometimes they're good (where he tells his wife that she will not strike their daughter), but generally they're getting worse. And the "infidel" moment struck me as utterly pointless, too. And what was with Melisandre pulling that daft expression?
3020	Gneisenau	2014-04-14	Am I the only one who is annoyed that almost every other Loras scene involves him eyeing another man ?
Â 
When it comes to Brienne, it's cool and all that she wants to be a knight, but knights also have to social graces when at court.
Â 
The Stannis scene was to introduce the Great Other, I always found it weird that people hate Dany but don't hate Stannis (not that I am absolving Dany).
Â 
I found the Oberyn and Tywin scene kinda funny because Tywin had a big smile.
Â 
I assume Tommen is gonna marry Marge as per the books, quite frankly it would kinda weird having a kid looking Tommen marrying an adult Marge.
Â 
One scene that kinda bugged me was in the Sept, when the priest said "thus who tear this union asunder will be cursed" (paraphrased). While the priest was saying this you could clearly see Pycelle and Oberyn in the background.
3021	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-14	Yeah it was Alester, Selyse's uncle. He was burned because he tried to marry Shireen to Tommen without Stannis' knowledge or consent. Axell still lives and continues to be an asshole to Jon at the Wall.


Yeah. So in the show, Axell gets to be burned. He goes "Selyse, you are my sister!" so...yeah my only beef lies with that.
Â 


I know people say Emilia Clarke or Kit Harrington are the worst actors on the series (I'd say they're both mediocre and extremely inconsistent) but Shaes actress is just the worst by far. Always terrible in every scene. I was laughing at her and Tyrions fight. Gods I can't wait for her to die.
Â 
Â 


Right? Clarke is pretty bad but she is not that level of bad. Nowhere near. Shae's actress is the worst ive seen since Megan Fox. Uggh.
Â 


My issue is how Sansa didn't know beforehand she was supposed to escape. The little agency she had was removed from her and it turned her into an object. It seems that subtlety of Sansa's character goes beyond them.Â 


She is not treated like an object, geez. Overreaction is overreaction.Â While i agree Sansa should have known to bolt when appropriate, some people are taking it way too far even for Impunity Zone. D:
3022	Yukle	2014-04-14	2. Cersei. Her comments to Brienne were utterly pointless and unwarranted, although her comment about Renly does kind of show that she's grasping at straws and getting desparate as she loses power. But there's better ways to handle it than... that. And yes, we know there's sexual tension between Jaime and Brienne. It does NOT need to be stated in such a blunt, stupid way.
Â 
5. Whilst I'm Team Stannis, I find his scenes utterly bizarre. Sometimes they're good (where he tells his wife that she will not strike their daughter), but generally they're getting worse. And the "infidel" moment struck me as utterly pointless, too. And what was with Melisandre pulling that daft expression?


Â 
Both of these points are issues I have as well. Stannis is coming across a petulant child driven only by ambition. He is meant to be driven by duty and justice. He is not a harsh and cruel person, either, and doesn't refuse to show discomfort. He just tolerates it. It's known that his marriage is not especially warm but I found his rudeness to his wife extremely out of character. He always does his duty, so I cannot imagine him being rude to someone his duty says he must treat honourably.
Â 
The only redeeming moment was Stannis' immediate defence of Shireen. There have not been enough scenes with her and Stannis. It is much needed depth to his character as to watchers of the show Stannis seems to be an unfair and almost cruel person.
Â 
And show don't tell! There was absolutely no need to have Cersei say, "You love him," to Brienne and it ruined the tension by pointing it out. Worse, Cersei is the most conceited person in Westeros. There's no chance whatsoever that she would feel jealous of Brienne.
Â 
Sansa is meant to be much more active in her escape than that. I was disappointed to see her whisked away, with no sneaking off to the Godswood and planning with her unknown saviour. It has stripped away some of her character's cleverness and left her without much depth.
Â 
Of course, though, there are great moments in the episode. My favourite was the part where Joffrey died.  Of course.  Although I did actually think it was well done: they reminded everyone why he is despised and ensured that every single person had a definite motive to kill him (except Cersei). And they also put in subtle indications that the Lannisters will actually be in a better position following his death.
Â 
The earlier scenes with Ramsay and Theon, including the bizarre decision to withhold Ramsay's identity, felt like filler. Now, however, the scenes feel excellent. The conversation between Roose and Ramsay was a welcome addition to the storyline not present in the books. Although Roose seems indifferent to his son in the books, it's entirely believable that behind closed doors he'd be frustrated by his sociopathic nature. The scenes also show the sheer impact of the torture Theon has endured to the point where each time you see him I plead with Ramsay, as I do while reading, "Seriously, just kill the poor guy!"
Â 
Shae is just in it for the money with Tyrion in the books but it seems she is genuinely the spurned lover in the TV series. It's interesting... but possible problematic.
Â 

	Spoiler  Perhaps it is leading to a massive revelation later, though. Jaime is meant to reveal Tyrion's first marriage was genuine and Tywin broke it up and claimed she was a prostitute. Jaime was complicit in this.
Â 
Perhaps, instead, it will be revealed that Shae is not in love with Tyrion but part of a plot to spy on Tyrion and the, "You will not take that whore to court," was a move from Tywin to ensure that TyrionÂ didÂ bring her to court. Maybe Jaime will tell Tyrion that. There must be some motive for Tyrion to kill Shae, and at the moment there doesn't seem to be one.

Â 
At least, that's my theory.

First watch the show before you criticize the actors.
3024	ohpooratlas	2014-04-14	I really don't have much to nitpick about this episode save for the burning on Dragonstone. I've been trying really hard to give the show creators the benefit of the doubt where Stannis is concerned, but I'm find it increasingly difficult to do so given how one-dimensional they make him look. You really don't get even a hint of conflict within him.
Â 
I watched the "inside the episode" and they even go as far to say that Stannis has completely turned 100% Team Melisandre.
Â 
Hopefully everything will be sorted out by the end of the season.
Â 
Also ... not nearly enough Davos.
3025	Gneisenau	2014-04-14	Well, Shae is a prostitute and so as a prostitute she pretends to like her clients. Shae isn't trained in theater, so I think it makes sense that Shae's acting is bad.

Â 
I meant character Shae not her actress. Essentially IMO, Shae's actress is acting an actress who isn't necessarily the best at acting, hence why I think it is okay the acting isn't that good.
3028	Ghost from Winterfell	2014-04-14	I really can't stand the romanticism in the series. Shae is terrible and her Bonnie and Clyde attitude just makes me want to puke. And then Tyrion's obvious lie and she falls for that, it's so contrived and melodramatic Hated that. Never cared for her but she didn't bother me as much before this episode. If they thought the" gold digger" Shae from the books was cliched they managed to do much, much worse.
Â 
And Stannis. Just Stannis. The burning scene was like a 'fuck off' to his fans.
Â 
(Overall I thought the episode was very good, if not painfully sadistic sometimes, but that is not actually bad).

The age of majority is younger in Westeros. Sansa is considered a "woman" at age thirteen.

The difference is that he never executes or sacrifices any innocent people in the books, though he does admittedly come uncomfortably close with Edric. I think one of the biggest problems is that, not only does it give us a depiction of his relationship to Rhillor that lacks nuance, but it also strips him of this strong sense of "duty" which was a redeeming, and important character trait that helped make him three-dimensional as a gray figure. One can question his utilitarian ethics, but having Stannis sacrifice "Axel" Florent in this way definitely cheapened him as a character, and worsened an already questionable adaptation of his arc.

Stannis looked real mad during that scene. His whole speech about why the burnings were happening was through clinched teeth. He was conflicted, angry, frustrated, and unsure if hes even doing the right thing. But hes gonna do it anyway cuz it is a means to an end. His whole demeanor was not that of a fanatic. I can see why Stannis fans are butthurt but i say to them: "Patience, my pets. Sooooon~~"
Â 


What a weird comment
What ever would make you assume she hasn't seen the show?


Right? Ive seen it enough to really observe. To clarify on Emilia Clarke, shes actually pretty good with straightforward, bombastic scenes like Astapor. Next week's taking of Meereen should be exciting enough. Shes good with that. Its just the other, more subtle stuff with Dany, shes not good with. Just..not enough chops.Â

Â 
Close to a religious fanatic, I think, he named Axell an infidel. He seemed conflicted but that just confirms he is Mel's puppet, the hapless king still licking his wounds after one whole season. That was my impression. Things can change but it looks like Stannis has no moral courage.

I actually thought her scenes in season 1 were quite good. She was natural and she more than held her own opposite Dinklage.
But since they've turned Shae into this jealous spiteful ... whatever.. she's quite terrible.Â 
She's given terrible material, but at least sheÂ tries to make it work.
Compared to Clarke, who, even when given good material, just stands there with that expressionless look on her face and monotone delivery.
3039	RoamingRonin	2014-04-14	Didn't like Cersei much this episode. I don't get why she suddenly hates Pycelle. In the first episode, she said he smells like dead cats (wonderful nod to books and Joff's kitten story?). In this episode she's biting his head off and dismissing him from the wedding... And for what?
She confronts Brienne about Jaime but I'm not sure why. I feel like I missed something. If she thinks Brienne loves Jaime she has to have a reason. 
I know the show cannot afford to be as subtle as the books but Cersei and Tywin talking about Shae at the wedding was just too odd, too open.
The lion's head felt out of place. Seemed too modern. 
I've liked Shae up until now. Why is she all of a sudden so jealous and so angry? Shae liked Sansa! She knows Tyrion isn't having sex with her. 
I'm annoyed with Derpy Stannis. I want him to grind his teeth and snap at people not sniff his food? What was that? Why does he always seem to be mentally challenged? I can't stand it. 
"Selyse! Don't burn me until I can tell the audience who I am and how we are related!" Exposition and a execution. Lovely.
Not loving Ramsay's portrayal. The actor is always too gleeful. It's very cliche, the smiling sadist.

I know, right? I've spent a good deal of time defending Sibel Kekilli's acting, but I was so, so unimpressed.

...To be fair, Lena Headey was underwhelming in that last scene as well. She was clearly trying to summon up more emotion than she was capable of conveying. Very disappointing.
Â 
Also annoyed at the lack of mention of the kinslaying curse in an episode where a character condoned the burning of her brother. Come ON!

Â 
I thought the same thing about Lena, not saying she's a bad actress, she does a great drunk Cersei, but it appears that over the top crying jag level stuff is not something she's good at.
Â 
I don't even care about the fake Shae crying, as someone else said, if they thought the "mean whore" was too trite, I don't see how Julia Roberts Goes To Westeros is supposed to be an improvement. Â At least we can comprehend why a whore might be mean. Â TV Shae is just insanely unbelievable now on every level, on top of totally falling in love with Tyrion and feeling like Sansa's mother, she's lost half her IQ points and fails to see she's in danger and wants to stand up..her and her man...against basically the rest of the powers that be. Â It makes Book Shae look quasidimensional.

Agreed. Why is he doing that? Ehh oh well.
3044	Stannis Eats No Peaches	2014-04-14	Stannis looked real mad during that scene. His whole speech about why the burnings were happening was through clinched teeth. He was conflicted, angry, frustrated, and unsure if hes even doing the right thing. But hes gonna do it anyway cuz it is a means to an end. His whole demeanor was not that of a fanatic. I can see why Stannis fans are butthurt but i say to them: "Patience, my pets. Sooooon~~"What annoys me is that no reason is given for the burnings other than that they were "infidels". To my knowledge, Stannis never burns anyone for differences in religion in the books (though Mel does in his absence), only criminals. Stannis is in no way religious, he's even on the fence about R'hllor's existence.
ETA:Agreed. Why is he doing that? Ehh oh well.
I can only hope that the extra whitewashing will make his later actions more shocking.

They actually explained that roose had to take a ship to get to the dreadfort.
3047	Misnthropia	2014-04-14	Oh, forgot, now we finally saw Daenerys' dragon scene 
Â 
All this freakout about it in the trailer, now we know.
Now we actually know more than from the books. She will come to KL. At least a dragon.Â 
That scene was so amazing, the whole vision.


Â 
It was discussed yesterday in a different thread but some believe that shadow to be far to large for Drogon and could be Balerion.
Â 
Â 


How could Ramsay trust Reek enough to razor shave his neck? Doesn't Reek want to die anyway? What has he to lose? All he has to do is slice Ramsay's neck and then death and an end to his suffering.


Â 
It was also to show Roose how well Reek has been trained and that he could be useful in the future. Roose was ready to throttle Ramsay because they wanted to trade Theon, but now theres another use for him - finding the Stark kids. Without that show of loyalty (fear) Roose would not have believed Ramsay or Reek and probably wouldve shoved his boot into Ramsay's asshole.
Â 
I dont have too many issues with this episode. I wouldve LOVED to have heard the Dont make me rue the day I raped your mother line. The comment about Valyrian steel to bring that chestnut back up.
Â 
I just cannot fathom how Stannis was portrayed. I like Stannis, Im not one of these huge STANNIS STANNIS STANNIS guys. But this was ridiculous. Stannis uses religion as a means to an end. He is not a fanatic. I dont even care it was the wrong Florent burnt, its the fact he said it was because he was an infidel.
Â 
I did enjoy the Dinner at Dragonstone and the suffer them all the same comment.
Â 
The timing with Jamie throws off his reaction. He SHOULD have not done anything, but you cant have him at the wedding and him just stand there doing nothing.
Â 
My other gripe is Balon Greyjoy. What the hell is going on with the Greyjoy timeline?!

Well yeah. I think this is D&D's personal insertion. But im hoping that this is going on so to make Stannis' break from Melisandre all the more dramatic and really contrast how he is when he isnt under her "spell" so to speak. Maybe. I do think you lot are on to something when you say D&D have some beef with Stannis, but i do also keep optimistic that he'll get his due. If they make Stannis look like a cunt during his finest hour(s), thats when you will see me grabbing the torch and pitchfork.
3049	Lord Damian	2014-04-14	Yeah, Joff being cuddled by his mother and his "real" father at the moment of his death, precious and also in front of everyone. I do love Oberyn right in Tywin's face saying the way it is and Tywin not doing shit. One gets the impression he fears Dorne. Also, Roose looks nervous and potentially scared at the truth of Bran and Rickon being alive. I do wish they mention the need for caution regarding the direwolves though.

3050	Newstar	2014-04-14	Right? Ive seen it enough to really observe. To clarify on Emilia Clarke, shes actually pretty good with straightforward, bombastic scenes like Astapor. Next week's taking of Meereen should be exciting enough. Shes good with that. Its just the other, more subtle stuff with Dany, shes not good with. Just..not enough chops.
Â 
Yeah. If all she had to do was yell at people in Valyrian, she'd be all set. 
Â 
ETA: From a purist point of view, Tyrion's newfound fidelity to Sansa is odd.
Â 
It seemed like a bit of a pointless detail. Even from a whitewashing perspective it made no sense, since Tyrion's plan in 3x07 was not to get rid of Shae post-marriage but to set her up in style as a permanent mistress. It also seemed like his fidelity to Sansa in 4x01--if you take his words to Shae at face value--had more to do with his stressful circumstances than any need to stay faithful to Sansa out of principle; even his refusal of the prostitutes in 4x01 on the basis of his marriage seemed more like he was using his marriage as an excuse rather than it being some great assertion of his personal morals.
3051	Stannis Eats No Peaches	2014-04-14	They actually explained that roose had to take a ship to get to the dreadfort.
Did they? That would make the most sense, but I only remember him saying that he was smuggled into his own lands, which would make no sense if he arrived by ship, with the Ironborn not being present in the east of the North. I realise that the script writers (GRRM?) are relying on me not knowing as much as I do, but I guess this is the nitpicking thread.
3052	Stannis Eats No Peaches	2014-04-14	Also, Oberyn calling Cersei "Lady Cersei". She's no longer the Queen Regent, but she's still the Queen Dowager.

Jaime's scenes, too.Â  It was like, let's pretend they were in a little bubble with each other, or another character, what could they say or do.Â  It had nothing to do with the overall story, and it's just as well they introduced some humor or spelled some things out, because what else could they do?

3060	CarCrashFiance	2014-04-14	Didn't like Cersei much this episode. I don't get why she suddenly hates Pycelle. In the first episode, she said he smells like dead cats (wonderful nod to books and Joff's kitten story?). In this episode she's biting his head off and dismissing him from the wedding... And for what?
She confronts Brienne about Jaime but I'm not sure why. I feel like I missed something. If she thinks Brienne loves Jaime she has to have a reason.
I know the show cannot afford to be as subtle as the books but Cersei and Tywin talking about Shae at the wedding was just too odd, too open.


Â 
The show has always been about dumbing things down for a dumber audience. They take the books and then spoon feed everything to the viewer. The most egregious changes that ruin the subtly are the changes to Renly and Loras. Though Littlefinger telling EVERYONE about his plans and knowledge is probably just as bad.
Â 
Cersei's paranoia and mistrust and rage have been strongly shown throughout the last season or so. Her threatening Margaery with the Rains of Castamere. Her threatening Littlefinger with her guards. Threatening to put Pycelle back into the dungeons. It's a FAR and STARK contrast to Cersei in season one where she subtly tells Ned that he'll either "win or die" and she ends up killing Robert with fortified wine.
Â 
We all know that Cersei goes close to mad and with Kevan and Tywin now dead she could be downright nuts in book six. I guess the show is going with the less subtle route of showing Cersei's descent into madness. This is the same show that had Stanni's wife keeping jars of dead infants. So I'm expecting Cersei to keep a mummified Joffrey corpse or something ridiculous.
Â 
Maybe they've dropped the Valonquar storyline. So they must find new reasons for her paranoia and mental degeneration.

Yeah but that's with the added drama of Joffrey's murder. This short scene seemed like quite a natural one to have before all that.I think bringing them back early sucked the drama out of quite a few scenes. A certain sept scene, for sure, that should have happened right away.
I totally agree.
3062	Rapsie	2014-04-14	ETA: From a purist point of view, Tyrion's newfound fidelity to Sansa is odd.

Yet another example of St Tyrion of Whitewashedom. In all seriousness though, I can't see how they are going to make it believable that he can kill Shae. There is going to have to be some serious character development in the next 7 episodes (presuming Shae and Tywin die in episode 9). 
The scene with Ramsey and Theon was really good. Hopefully they will tone down the torture for the rest of the season (as we get it, Ramsay is bad). 
Jaime and Brienne don't work well, which is a shame as it was one of the storylines they did well last year. Having them arrive early in KL doesn't really work.
3063	Newstar	2014-04-14	I just hope that it'll make people all the more shocked when he starts murdering and raping, though I'm worried that Tywin is going to be the one who murders her.
Â 
Nah, the show always keeps the major beats. Tyrion killing Shae is a major beat.
Â 
As for the whitewashing, it's just moving things around slightly. I fully anticipate that the writers will "course-correct" so that Tyrion maps on to end of ASOS Tyrion nicely by the time 4x10 rolls around. Remember everyone's outrage in Season 2 when Arya hadn't killed in cold blood yet? The writers course-corrected there but good, to the point where people are complaining that she seems too cold, too early.
Â 
I'll happily admit I'm wrong if Tyrion doesn't kill Shae. That shot of Shae lounging on the bed from the promo--with her hair unbound, so not from 4x01--pretty much guarantees that he will.

That will turn a good portion of the audience against him. Â It is impossible, given Julia Roberts Shae that her testimony could turn the audience against her enough to justify her murder.

That may be because the transition in Arya is too quick.  Harrenhall and the journey there were major turning points in her character and the death of Polliver is taken from the death of 
	Spoiler  Raff, which is much later on in her path with the faceless Men. 
 as for Tyrion, I doubt they will have his descent from ADWD. He may get melancholy and drunk, but raping and threatening prostitutes will probably be out of the question without it seeming like they have jumped the shark with the character.

I have yet to see Breaking Bad, but it would be good if they could pull off a major change. The problem is they have stripped all his grey actions and given him more saintly ones. They had a chance last season to introduce singer stew etc which would have given the audience pause for thought or something similar. But now the character shift is going to appear almost evil twin level.
3075	Le Cygne	2014-04-14	I watched the Shae/Tyrion scene again, it was the crying part that killed it. The rest of it could have worked, but she's not a good crier, they should have had her stand by the window and hide her face in the curtains or something.

Â 
Quite frankly, TV Shae is a much nicer and more likeable person than Skyler White was....which is more of the problem, they made Shae so nice, so in love, so protective of Sansa, that Tyrion killing her will be MUCH WORSE than it was in the book.

Â 
When Robb executed Rickard Karstark, I believe he did say "Kill me and be cursed, you are no king of mine". However it was never really expanded onto what it meant. Much like the Guest Right thing. Its never actually said how big a deal it actually is in Westeros to be a Kinslayer or to kill someone under the protection of Guest Right

Â 
Sigur Ros' rendition of Rains of Castamere is probably my favourite, actually. It's so haunting that it turns the Lannister's "victory song" on its head; a song that's been used to reinforce the victories of their house, instead now lamenting on the beginning of their fall from grace.
Â 
As for the themes, that's what a theme is - a recurring melody that signifies a certain character, location and/or moment. Ramin Djawadi does an amazing job bending the familiar themes each season to keep them fresh and relate to them to current events. We've also heard a few new musical pieces, including Oberyn and the Thenn's theme - both brilliantly crafted.
3079	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-14	If Loras and Oberyn have a thing I'm going to lose my shit.

ITA!!!Â  That one look between Oberyn and Loras was a thing of beauty but I suspect that is as good as D&D can do with any situation involving a man and Loras.Â  Note to D&D:Â  Do NOT look at Loras and Oberyn and think Willas and Oberyn, do NOT, just walk away.Â

3085	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-14	My issue is how Sansa didn't know beforehand she was supposed to escape. The little agency she had was removed from her and it turned her into an object. It seems that subtlety of Sansa's character goes beyond them.Â 


Â 
Yeah, really.Â  What was with Dontos and the Terminator/Reese impersonation:Â  If you want to live, come with me?Â  The two Sansa and Dontos scenes actually look as if the original intent, perhaps, was for the two of them to have a plan in place, almost.Â  It seems as if something is missing from the necklace scenes to the Terminator 'if you want to live, come with me' scene. Â I almost wonder if D&D kept changing their minds with how to handle the Sansa and Dontos situation.Â

Â and while we're at it.. Tywins as well... god I just wanted to reach through my TV set and bitch slap the shit out of them both!

Â 
For me, actually, Jaime's run to Joffrey's side was moving, and gave the only pathos to Joffrey's death; because for whatever reasons, Lena Headey's performance was off, as you noted. Â I saw Jaime's action, and his calling Joffrey's name as he ran, as his reaction to his nephew's plight, to the terrible danger in which his beloved sister's son was in, rather than the concern of a father or Kingsguard. Â Jaime was, after all, a Lannister, and this boy was not only a Lannister, he was the firstborn of the person Jaime has loved most in all his life.


Â 
I side with you on the fact that considering Lena's acting, someone had to mourn for Joff. I just wish it had been Cersei.Â 
Â 


Am I the only one who is annoyed that almost every other Loras scene involves him eyeing another man ?
Â 
When it comes to Brienne, it's cool and all that she wants to be a knight, but knights also have to social graces when at court.
Â 
The Stannis scene was to introduce the Great Other, I always found it weird that people hate Dany but don't hate Stannis (not that I am absolving Dany).
Â 
I found the Oberyn and Tywin scene kinda funny because Tywin had a big smile.
Â 
I assume Tommen is gonna marry Marge as per the books, quite frankly it would kinda weird having a kid looking Tommen marrying an adult Marge.
Â 
One scene that kinda bugged me was in the Sept, when the priest said "thus who tear this union asunder will be cursed" (paraphrased). While the priest was saying this you could clearly see Pycelle and Oberyn in the background.


This. On this show, if you are gay, that is all you are. You might get some sort of arc, but trust and believe the fact that you are gay will beat that arc over its head until we forget what it's about and focus on your gayness.Â 
I hope they do something with Loras. He doesn't have the biggest storyline, but he's more than his sexuality. I rolled my eyes so hard at that scene with him flirting with Oberyn my eyes almost got stuck that way. That shit gets annoying after a while, but I have to remind myself it is HBO.Â
3091	Xanrn	2014-04-14	Wow yeah this advance certain storylines is backfiring like mad.
Â 
Joffrey dying was every bit as fucking funny as I thought it would be.
Â 
Why the fuck swap out Roose setting a messenger raven to Ramsay for Roose playing "Behind Enemy Lines!"
Â 
How in the name of holy fuck did Locke get away with hacking Jaimies hand off...Â  Tywin just let that go huh? No consequences at all...
Â 
Come to it why the fuck did he cut off his hand, Vargo did it to try and break the deal. Locke did it why?...
Â 
Where they going with the North is beyond me, but hey it can't be worse than the Fuck You that was a Dance with Dragons.
Â 
LoL Oooh Dragon Shadow over King's Landing most be about Dany... Yeah because she is on her way... Or you know Fakegon... Or Varys murdering people because of Fakegon... Or as other people said the history of Targayens made a giant building in King's Landing as Kennels for their Dragons... Or Bloodraven a Targayen bastard is talking to Bran...
Â 
How long before Oberyn gets his fucking face smash in, because that will be as funny as Joffrey. Idiot Martells family of stooges who can't take a crap without giving themselves papercuts with the bog paper.

Tywinn went over to shield Tommen from Joffrey.  Check when Cersei shoves aside Margaery Tywinn starts to move.  When they have the shot with Tyrion first in the background Tywinn covering Tommen face.
3094	Alayne's Shadow.	2014-04-14	* Brienne's scene with Cersei was cringe-worthy. The writers simply don't know subtlety at all. Characters need to say their feelings to complete strangers disregarding characterization. Cersei confronting Brienne was just bizarre. I've given up on them thinking the audience can notice something without being over-exposed. I was waiting for Sansa to turn to Tyrion when the 'Dwarf!Robb' appeared and said "I'm sad." Speaking of Sansa, by the way, what's the deal with Brienne not interacting with her? That's just stupid. Same with Brienne not interacting with Loras. No, instead they decided on Brienne and Margaery.
Â 
* Shae. That's all.
Â 
* Jaime is already in King's Landing, and his story is seriously hurt by it.

Tywin was probably thanking the Stranger (in his thoughts) for relieving him and the realm of a very dangerous King; grandson be damned. Â Joffrey was likely to have eventually struck out at Tywin (and if Tywin was dead by then, Joffrey might well have gone after Tommen, Jaime, or even Cersei); and I'm sure Tywin realized it.

Â 
Cersei's lack of tears at Joffrey's death. Her reaction was overall underwhelming.
Â 
I read the book so I knew what was going to happen to Joffrey. I was looking forward to seeing it. But actually seeing it
was horryfying! Jack's little face all messed up and in agony. Good lord! That is superb acting. I actually felt sorry for him.Â
3098	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-14	Oh wow yes, I blocked out the Cersei/Brienne scene. Wtf was that.
They're gonna make Brienne interact with everyone in King's Landing except the two people she actuallyÂ should interact with: Sansa and Loras.
Next week, Brienne chats about the weather with Ilyn Payne and sleeps with Sex God Pod.


Â 
It was glaringly apparent that some of the Brienne scenes just didn't flow - I mean, having her as the only person to approach the high table at the wedding? Sure, it allowed for Cersei to suddenly fritter after her, which left her so angry she had to go and kick her dog (Pycelle) etc....
Â 
But Brienne's scenes themselves seemed, a bit 'off'. Gwen did a stand up job though.
Â 
In the big picture, it just felt like the whole wedding was perhaps 1 episode too early.Â

FINALLY someone else noticed.
Â 
Â 


It seemed like a bit of a pointless detail. Even from a whitewashing perspective it made no sense, since Tyrion's plan in 3x07 was not to get rid of Shae post-marriage but to set her up in style as a permanent mistress. It also seemed like his fidelity to Sansa in 4x01--if you take his words to Shae at face value--had more to do with his stressful circumstances than any need to stay faithful to Sansa out of principle; even his refusal of the prostitutes in 4x01 on the basis of his marriage seemed more like he was using his marriage as an excuse rather than it being some great assertion of his personal morals.


You know, I think I may vaguely be able to explain this. At the 'breakfast' (I assume), Tyrion was shown to catch wind of Cersei and Tywin's discussion (or to realise they were muttering amongst themselves, and about something specific), and given Tyrion's perception and intellect I think it's very possible he got the idea that they were talking about Shae. We've got an explanation for a future event (I forget how the books explained it, if they did at all), one that seems slightly out of character for Tywin admittedly, and if I'm right, then I think it's the driving force behind Tyrion's dismissal of Shae.
Â 
You can then extrapolate from this Tyrion's actions. He's seeing Joffrey go utterly bezerk, and is digging his feet in to show he won't be bowed or bent. The faithfulness he shows to Sansa seems to be Tyrion realising his actions are jeapordising his own life, as well as Sansa's and Shae's. And we even see Sansa reciprocate that to some slight degree when she picks up the goblet (or at least that's what it looks like), because I think she's realising that she needs to play the part of the dutiful wife to keep the attention away from herself. Basically, to me, it seems like Tyrion is trying to make himself a smaller target, but this is what backfires and results in the accusation. He is the easiest target. He is the one who supposedly messes up all of the time. It is so easy for Cersei to blame Tyrion (with no proof) and it's clear Tywin backs her in the accusation. Who has the most reason to kill Joffrey? Tyrion, of course. He doesn't listen, he and Tyrion have always conflicted and Tyrion has never abstained from hitting or verbally chastising Joffrey (oh those season one slaps were amazing), and that very morning Joffrey destroyed his wedding gift from Tyrion essentially in his face.
Â 
And it's easy to imagine the Tyrells would want Tyrion out of the way, because he's a Lannister, but also because he's too intelligent for his own good. With him out of the way they can stick a claim in Sansa and use her for their own purposes (don't forget Margaery was grooming her), they have essentially an easier time of taking King's Landing (Tywin will die soon or could be easily ousted; Cersei would be very easy to deal with; Jaime is essentially a non-issue as he's essentially left his family; Tommen? Well, marry him off to someone or 'lose' him) and thus the Iron Throne.
Â 
Just my ideas, of course, nitpicking a nitpick.

In a tv show the credited writer doesn't necessarily write all the lines of a given episode, it just means s/he's the one who pens the final draft.
I don't know if it's any different for this show (i'm guessing not) but episodes are generally written by a group of writers in the writer's room, so as to keep continuity between the episodes. Ultimately, the showrunners have the final say anyway.
So just because GRRM is credited doesn't mean he actually wrote that one conversation and even if he did, it doesn't make it any less cringe-worthy - if anything it makes it more so, because you'd expect more subtlety from him.

It just had to be said.
The first few posts were acceptable but now this is just madness. Nitpick, okay, but real hate against certain things and especially the writing, that's crazy. as it is written by the author of the series.
You know that there are people who really like that show and it's adaptation. And if others just can't get warm with the show, just don't watch it. But give the neutral people a chance for a normal thread without hate against the show and the actors. That's not what a forum is for. That's what the comment section of youtube is for.
3114	SeventySeven	2014-04-15	I hate to be the person nitpicking on people on the nitpick thread, but here goes:
Â 


I had a problem with seeing Melisandre eat. In the books she doesn't eat, her "faith" sustains her. And Davos wasn't eating with them.
Â 
Â 


Â 
Mel does eat, she says so in her chapters. She says she doesn't need to but has to eat anyway sometimes because people get weird about it. So it was in character.
Â 


Â 
Apparently, D&D wrote the Brienne/Cersei scene and the Loras/Jaime scene. (Citation needed, I know. I saw that somewhere.)


Â 
I read the interview here, and they never say they wrote it. They only said it was their idea. For all we know grrm could have wrote the scene after b&w told them want sort of interaction they wanted.Â 
Â 
Â 
Imo, I thought it was a pretty good scene. First of all because dispels the never ending talk on whether Brienne loves Jaime; it's canon in the books that she does, but being more subtle many like to argue it isn't there so sometimes you have to hit your audience in the face with things, or else they just won't get it. And secondly I liked it because it was very Cersei. It's not like she's jealous of Brienne and Jaime's bond- she's clearly not threatened by her, is that she's irked by Brienne being free to not act and call herself a lady, whenever she isn't. So her reaction is to find Brienne's weak spots and go in for the kill, and then lay some more hate at Pycelle's doorstep, which is something she does regularly in the books. It was very book!Cersei and the most in character she's been since Blackwater, so I'm pretty convinced that grrm had something to do with it.
Â 
For the nitpick, I also didn't like Cersei's initial reaction to Joff dying, it was so underwhelming. In the books she cries, she's desperate, the guards can't tear her away from him. In the show she... ehm, cried for a second? I liked her anger afterwards and though it was great, but it seemed to go from something that looked like sadness to rage too fast.

3116	G-Stark	2014-04-15	Really not happy with Tyrion-Shae relationship.
Her ultimate betrayal is more shocking because it's unexpected and proves she's just a selfish wh0re after all.
The fact that they're softening the blow by leading the audience into, "ah yes, you can see her point of view, Tyrion pushed her away etc" is poor.
They're maybe trying to heap more audience anger onto Tywin but I really don't like it.
Â 
Also, the Boltons are just not scary enough for me. They're meant to be some rotten, dirty, evil b@stards yet they come off quite likeable. i feel more hatred toward Theon for murdering two farm boys.

Agreed. I would have happily swapped the Margaery/Brienne scene in episode 1 for Brienne/Sansa, which would have been more important knowing what's to come and keep it more book canon, too. In the books Brienne is devastated Cat had died, it really breaks her heart. To have Brienne and Sansa discuss it, or just simply mention it, would have been a far better scene.Â

3125	Matthew Marzolf	2014-04-15	Ugh me too.Â 
Why use it at the end of an episode in which a LannisterÂ dies? It makes no sense.
In general, I find the score to be less and less inspired with each passing season. They have like 5 themes they rehash and remix over and over again.Â 


Â 
Admittedly in the book, there are something like 7 versions of the Rains of Castamere sung at the wedding alone.
3126	FNF	2014-04-15	The shameless Stannis butchering and the Oberyn-Loras 'interaction'. I find it hard to believe that both were GRRM's ideas. Infidel? Really?! And there's bad, bad blood between the Tyrells (minus Willas ironically) and Oberyn.Â 
Â 
I don't even think these count as 'nitpicks'. They are just flat out mistakes. There are things I consider minor mistakes such as the underwhelming atmosphere of the wedding and a couple of other scenes but those are nitpicks.Â

But you don't to read through the lyrics 7 times do you?
The repetition of the song on the show just lessens its impact, imo.

I actually like it, I feel like they're using it to trace the arc of the Lannister's downfall, where each rendering becomes less boastful and more morose, and thus, ironic.
3129	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-04-15	We won't be seeing him again more than likely. The actor is dying of cancer 



Certainly, but they should at least have her make eye contact or appear concerned about Sansa's existence whatsoever. The reason she came to KL or even got involved with Jaime in the first place is because Catelyn asked her to fetch her daughters. Granted Catelyn is dead but Brienne's characterization even in the show has been set up such that Sansa would be very important to her.

3131	Chebyshov	2014-04-15	I was disappointed how little the High Septon was shown. I hope that's not indicative of them glossing over the Faith of the Seven stuff moving forward.
3132	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-15	I had a problem with seeing Melisandre eat. In the books she doesn't eat, her "faith" sustains her. And Davos wasn't eating with them.
Â 
Cersei's lack of tears at Joffrey's death. Her reaction was overall underwhelming.
Â 
I read the book so I knew what was going to happen to Joffrey. I was looking forward to seeing it. But actually seeing it
was horryfying! Jack's little face all messed up and in agony. Good lord! That is superb acting. I actually felt sorry for him.Â 


Â 
iirc, in the books Mel thinks about how she has to remind herself to eat, otherwise people would notice and get suspicious.Â

Seeing as the faith is possibly the worst added complication to the final two books (my opinion), I hope they skip that plot.
3134	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-15	Â 
It was glaringly apparent that some of the Brienne scenes just didn't flow - I mean, having her as the only person to approach the high table at the wedding? Sure, it allowed for Cersei to suddenly fritter after her, which left her so angry she had to go and kick her dog (Pycelle) etc....
Â 
But Brienne's scenes themselves seemed, a bit 'off'. Gwen did a stand up job though.
Â 
In the big picture, it just felt like the whole wedding was perhaps 1 episode too early.Â 


Â 
I agree, that scene of the lonely, and one and only, Brienne approaching the happy couple was more awkward than Cersei and her 'do you love him?' add on that came out of nowhere.Â  As awful as that line of Cersei's was, along with the delivery of it, I do have to give Brienne credit for the long moment of 'WTF?' silence that followed it.Â
3135	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-15	Did he direct the camera guy shooting straight down the distraught Cersei bqqbs in the death scene? Or was that the prankster who copped the W head for headless Ned?


Â 
LOLÂ  I do own the GWB edition of that.Â  Â  Â  So, maybe the camera guy thought Cersei's boobs would have a better reaction to Joff's death than her mouth did?Â  Otherwise, not sure why they let that blatent look down her dress into the scene, especially that type of scene.Â
3136	HelenaExMachina	2014-04-15	I was disappointed how little the High Septon was shown. I hope that's not indicative of them glossing over the Faith of the Seven stuff moving forward.
There is time. We arent up to the relevant Faith stuff yet, this is still "Tyrion's High Septon". The High Sparrow comes after that. And we only really meet the sparrows during Briennes travels. I would have been surprised if they added the Faith stuff now

That would be a monumental deviation and problem for the plot. They are currently the main storyline for everything in King's Landing at the moment, and everything revolves around that and the upcoming Faith trial.

3139	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-15	Â 
Agreed. I would have happily swapped the Margaery/Brienne scene in episode 1 for Brienne/Sansa, which would have been more important knowing what's to come and keep it more book canon, too. In the books Brienne is devastated Cat had died, it really breaks her heart. To have Brienne and Sansa discuss it, or just simply mention it, would have been a far better scene.Â 


Â 
I'm wondering if one of the reasons that they kept Brienne away from Sansa was to prevent Sansa being offered help escaping from someone that she might trust?Â  That, and I do think, perhaps, that Brienne is still trying to work out what would be best to do, and thinks she has some time to work it out.Â  Still, it is very glaring to not even throw in a 'hello, I'm sorry about your mother, she was good to me, etc.?'Â  I suppose it could be put down to Brienne not wanting to draw attention to her and Sansa having anything to talk about IF she should have the chance to get her out of KL?Â  Besides, we do know that Brienne had no idea that all hell would be breaking lose at the wedding.Â 
Â 
All in all, even with these reasons, it looks awkward not to have some type of acknowledgement of Sansa by Brienne.Â  They could have done that or.........had Brienne discuss with Jaime how she didn't want to bring attention to herself in relation to Sansa, in front of others.Â  Still, with 2 episodes under our belts, it looks weird.Â

I wonder if that line from Margaery about a necklace of dead sparrows was a little nod to book readers. I really hope it was.
3141	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-15	Upon rewatching, the lack of a shared chalice is getting to me more and more. Why did Mace even give it as a gift then?!


Â 
Yeah, that's bugging me too.Â  What the hell was the point if Joff didnt' use it to get stinking drunk and die?Â Joff was obviously continually drinking out of a much smaller cup.Â Â

I know, but it's just another extreme complication in an already overly complicated story. I would hope they could find another way to indict Cersei but now that I think about it the only way would be if the Tyrells accuse her after she accuses Margaery of infidelity, but that would present a lot of problems as well.

Tbh there's just no way that both book!Brienne and show!Brienne wouldn't have rushed to Sansa to at least let her know Cat fought and fought, and was trying to get both she and her sister back. Brienne was concerned about letting Margaery know she didn't kill Renly, so there's no way she wouldn't have spoken to Sansa. They fucked it up by changing the timeline but wanting to keep the same exact storyline with Sansa escaping with Dontos, and now both Jaime and Brienne look like morons. If they change timelines they need to have better back up plans that make sense.
3161	Queen of Whores	2014-04-15	Aside from the obviously atrocious adaptation of Stannis, I really don't like how Selyse has been done. Yes she's fanatical in the books, but she isn't an idiot either. And she truly loves and cares for Shireen. That's probably her one redeeming quality, and they got rid of it just to create some cheap drama.
3162	Konradsmith	2014-04-15	I'd paste my response to your equivalent post in another thread, Queen of Whores, but I can't paste on AFOIAF as I've complained about time and again. I will take issue with your saying that show Stannis is "obviously atrocious" however.Â There are many of us who do not think so . So, not really obvious then, is it? There is a certain demographic or contingent of the fandom who is VERY upset about his adaptation but like Nixon I will appeal to the "silent majority" who feel quite differently.
Â 
As for their Selyse adaptation, they've given Stannis a character to react against. Without her we would not have some of his better lines in "Kissed By Fire" and, yes, in "the Lion and the Rose". While I would have preferred bickering from within his real marriage, to Davos, I was very entertained by what we got this episode.

3166	Thelastactionhero	2014-04-15	Stannis looked real mad during that scene. His whole speech about why the burnings were happening was through clinched teeth. He was conflicted, angry, frustrated, and unsure if hes even doing the right thing. But hes gonna do it anyway cuz it is a means to an end. His whole demeanor was not that of a fanatic. I can see why Stannis fans are butthurt but i say to them: "Patience, my pets. Sooooon~~"


Â 
Despite how pissed I am about what they're doing with Stannis, this post gave me a much needed laugh. The character I grew to love from the books is definitely not present in this portrayal, and he can't be now, due to these alterations, but who knows. Maybe his moment at the Wall, done correctly, will make all the bullshit worth it. They've given him a few scenes, particularly in Season 2, that are really stunning, so maybe I shouldn't abandon all hope, since we haven't seen how the battle at Castle Black is gonna go down.

Â 
Dogs hunt by dropping an animal through taking out their back legs.
Â 
Wolves do not hunt like dogs.
Â 
It has actually been demonstrated that wolves specifically hunt by intentionally causing the prey animal to release as much adrenaline into their body as possible, then to kill as fast as possible when the adrenaline is at its peak. At this point the wolves kill by attacking the neck and throat. It isn't as quick and clean as cats, but it is still absolutely an attack at the neck and throat.
Â 
(The adrenaline levels in the meat are passed out through the the wolf's urine - as a marker and a deterrent to other packs "We are stronger than you".)

3172	RavenKing23	2014-04-16	Really? I never heard about the adrenaline before, but why would they attack at the adrenaline peak, when the animal is at its strongest? Seems conterproductive for a wild animal to take risk like that for scent markers when a good howl could do just the same. Of course it would work well for small prey like rabbits and such but not a deer, besides running them to ground should produce enough adrenaline along the way

Â 
They scent mark purely to communicate with other wolves. A lot of study into wolf behaviour is ongoing. Urine samples have been taken and the urine/adrenaline connection has been directly made - we can only hypothesise as to its purpose but it is thought more adrenaline = stronger/better pack.
Â 
Other behaviours recently discovered is when Â wolves are lying in wait in snow, they have been observed licking snow and ice to reduce breath-frosting that would give them away and there are indications that the alpha wolf chooses which wolves can fall pregnant and when.

If Bronn is around, then shouldn't Tyrion choose him for his trial by combat, especially since Bronn is not tied down in the show? Since the show, for whatever reason, decided to bring Jamie to king's landing so early, what's the point in him training now that the king is dead? Why the hell is Tommen so old? The boy is supposed to be a chubby little 2 year old. He looked pompous as hell eating at the wedding. Okay, i get it...Loras is gay. Everytime the show portays loras they just HAVE to remind us that he's gay, as if the character cannot exist without flagrantly showing his homosexuality. 
I liked that bit between the red viper and tywin. The way the show handles joffrey's poisoning made it look pretty clear that anyone who was watching (and that was everybody was) could have easily seen that it was so circumstantial that Tyrion couldn't possibly have played a part in it.

Since the show, for whatever reason, decided to bring Jamie to king's landing so early, what's the point in him training now that the king is dead? Why the hell is Tommen so old? The boy is supposed to be a chubby little 2 year old. He looked pompous as hell eating at the wedding. Okay, i get it...Loras is gay. Everytime the show portays loras they just HAVE to remind us that he's gay, as if the character cannot exist without flagrantly showing his homosexuality.
I liked that bit between the red viper and tywin. The way the show handles joffrey's poisoning made it look pretty clear that anyone who was watching (and that was everybody was) could have easily seen that it was so circumstantial that Tyrion couldn't possibly have played a part in it. End rant until i re-watch.


Â 
Ilyn Payne actor has terminal cancer. I guess instead of recasting which everyone hates so much to begin with, they chose a character with nothng else to do that the audience can identify with and is a fan favorite. Plus the two characters' personalities make for a very dynamic duo. Plus Bronn will do anything for money, so he won't tell on Jaime unless someone pays him an enormous amount of gold to tell them that a one handed knight is no longer a good fighter which honestly seems like a waste of money, right? Also Jaime is still Lord Commander of the Kingsguard and a Knight...Just because Joffrey died is he supposed to stop training?Â

I didn't know about the character having terminal cancer. The whole jamie thing doesn't work for me. It's been a while since i read the books, but if i remember correctly, jamie started training with Ilyn payne after the king had died and outside of king's landing. I guess it really doesn't matter, but if show jamie's son was just murdered and his brother is accused of killing him... Then who the hell has time for training? Granted, we'll see what the show does in the future.

He's the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. His duty 24/7 is to be a Knight, and protect the King. Jaime says "How can I protect the King when I can barely wipe my own arse." Not seeing any poor logic there. Joffrey dying and Tyrion being imprisoned doesn't change the fact that as a Knight, especially a Kingsguard Knight, your #1 priority should probably be learning how to actually be a knight again. Then again this is the nitpick with impunity thread so I'll leave it at that.

Thank you for remembering that. I see a big difference between Jamie undertaking a project, witnessing his son's murder, and then returning to that project, and jamie witnessing his son's murder and then undertaking a project. For me, the latter signifies catharsis, and the former shows something else. Again, we'll have to see where the show takes it. For me, i've finally accepted that this is not ASOIAF or Storm of Swords, but Game of Thrones the TV Show (inspired by ASOIAF).

Â 
I see what you mean about a catharsis...However I think everything in the book points to Jaime not giving a shit about Joffrey (I believe his exact words were a squirt of seed in Cersei's cunt), so I don't see how anything cathartic could come out of that experience. More or less it's just a matter of timing. In the books Jaime needs to relearn how to fight in order to continue being a Knight, but he happens to arrive in KL after Joff dies.Â

Â 
1) Oberyn flirting was prior to dwarf joust
Â 
2) Rewatch it and have a look at what Renly was riding.... or rather 'who' Renly was riding.
3188	Chebyshov	2014-04-16	Okay, this is the nitpickiest of nitpicks: the melody they wrote for "the bear and the maiden fair," all of which can be heard in the background of Loras/Jaime's convo, doesn't work with the lyrics to the song, from a measures/time signature standpoint.

Loras.Â  That Brienne moped for Renly is a nothing since she is a nothing.Â  That Loras was King Renly's lover is funny to Joff.Â  He doesn't care about insulting the Tyrrell family, just as he doesn't care about insulting his Aunt Sansa, or his own houses of Baratheon and Lannister.Â 
Â 
He is almost singularly unsuited to be King at any time, much less a time of civil war and invasion.Â  Everything about him is a huge fail on Cersei's part, and by extension, Tywin's.

I was kinda bugged by this too given that there was an entire scene devoted to finding a good necklace for Marg.Â  Was it just to diss Lanister taste in fashion? It was interesting that Marg's necklace also had small stones in it, like Sansa's and was quite different than the huge golden collar that Cersei wore.Â  Hmmmmm....

i actually think that was to bring attention to sansa's necklace and the role it played. i expect to hear more about her necklace in next week's show and viewers will have already been primed to think of necklaces as being important.

3206	JyanaReed	2014-04-17	My biggest complaint about this episode was Cersei's acting at the moment of Joffrey's death. In the books, she has an absolute hysterical breakdown when Joff dies, but on the show she seem much more concerned with getting Tyrion put away than she was with the fact that her son was dead.Â 
Â 
Also, screw what they're doing with the Shae/Tyrion/Sansa storyline. I hate it so much, and it's going to totally change how Tyrion is perceived.Â 
Â 
Also, some of the wedding dialogue, like the exchange between Jaime and Loras, and between Oberyn and Cersei seemed really heavy-handed and overdone.Â 
Â 
I could go on and on, this really wasn't one of my favorite episodes. At least that little blonde shit is dead.Â
3207	The Boar of Gore	2014-04-18	I was hoping to see some fear in Joff's eyes when he died, the way it was in the books, and kind of like the way Joff looked when King Robert died. That way, we would have had some unexpected audience sympathy just for the fact that a human being died, even a really horrible one.
3208	CarCrashFiance	2014-04-18	I was a bit suprised they did Jof's death so early in the season.


It's actually better that way for non-book readers. They now expect a major death at the end of every season with Ned and the Red Wedding and even Khal Drogo.
Â 
They had their guard down at the Purple Wedding. Maybe they'll have their guard down at the end of the season when a certain arrow is shot at a man while he is on the privy. It would be good if the show's writers made every scene from now on seem almost life or death. Really heighten the suspense, especially in King's Landing to show Cersei's (justified) paranoia. Now you're not even safe in the first few episodes.
Â 
One of the best parts about shows like Sopranos or OZ was that you never knew if someone was going to get killed. Out of nowhere an argument over a dead horse turns into a murder. Obviously book readers aren't surprised. But I always felt like the best deaths in the books were the ones that happened in the centers of the novels.
Â 
When Jon "died" at the end of book five I just laughed because it was such a cliched cliffhanger. If GRRM had killed Jon off in the middle of the book he likely would have needed to commit to him being dead. Though he could have hidden him off screen like Lady Stoneheart.

Â 
In the books Joffrey lets out some hideous gasping noise through his throat. Struggling for air. Desperately trying to save his life. Even clawing his throat open.
Â 
The makeup and visuals of his death were amazing. But it wasn't as terrifying as the books. In the novel people are literally screaming at the top of their lungs. It is CHAOS. The High Septon is screaming into the sky shouting for the Gods to help. The Maesters are screaming for people to fetch potions. The guests are fleeing the hall. People are panicking thinking that they might be poisoned as well. That's how Sansa escapes.
Â 
It seems like the chaos and commotion was basically non-existent. That was the biggest loss for me. That when everyone realizes the King is unquestionably going to die....they begin fleeing not knowing if this is part of some violent uprising or if some war might break out. Sansa escapes in that confusion. I don't see how her and Captain America could escape in the TV version.

That's my biggest complaint this episode: it just felt so flat.
The party itself just felt so.. .uneventful. Even Sansa and Tyrion's wedding looked more festive.Â 
It was just 20 minutes of people throwing overwrought quips at each other and Joffrey being even more comically evil that usual. (I know I'm in the minority on this, but i absolutely despise Gleeson's portrayal of Joffrey, it's just so one-dimensional and predictable).
Joffrey dies and everyone just stands there. Cersei barely has a reaction.
The script to this episode was not exactly great to begin with but the directing was SW-prequels-level boring.
3210	Queen of Whores	2014-04-18	Olenna's delivery of the line "idiots, help your king!" was kind of cringeworthy. First of all, I don't feel like the word 'idiots' belongs in a semi-medieval-like setting. It feels so off. And the way the line was said was kind of laughable. I don't know, this is a really small nitpick, but after rewatching the scene it stands out as particularly bad.Â

How will he be perceived now? Â In the books his character was at least morally grey, on the show so far, he has pretty much been a paragon of virtue. Â IMO the show has made much easier to like than the books ever did.

Â 
He's been made a lot more likable although I wouldn't go as far as calling him "a paragon of virtue". Ultimately, he's still used whores, he was at least partly responsible for setting Blackwater Bay alight with Wildfire, and even if he's not fully approving and compliant of his families actions, he's involved with people like Tywin, Cersei and Joffrey and their awful actions nevertheless. Compared to the books, he's arguably a paragon of virtue, but in the context of the show alone he's certainly not. Perhaps he's not as morally grey as characters like Theon or Jaime, whereas he arguably is in the books, but he's still fairly morally grey in the show, even if he's closer to white then black.
3217	Matthew Marzolf	2014-04-18	Â 
  . Also I find all of that stuff fascinating. Plus, 
	Spoiler  the amount of power The Faith has accrued and the fact that they're armed again is likely to have heavy impacts on the story aside from Cersei being arrested. Especially if Stannis wins in the North and becomes a threat again, Â because they'd never allow him to take the IT with his fringe-religion. 



Â 
It might be fringe religion in Westeros but in it seems to be huge in Essos and this conflagration will probably spill back and forth between both continents.
3218	Beric175	2014-04-18	Well, after he kills Shae and tywin he'll be a lot less likeable.
3219	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-18	Well, after he kills Shae and tywin he'll be a lot less likeable.


Â 
A lot of that will depend on it's portrayal, though. At the moment, he'd come across a lot less likable for doing so because Tywin is more sympathetic in the show than he is in the books. Depending on how they portray him in the remainder of the season though, that may change once again.

Right. Â I think the show will go in a direction where everyone will want him to kill them both. Â Most would already rightfully cheer if he killed Tywin.
Â 
I sincerely think they want him to be a good guy on the show and his murders (if they appear at all) will not be nearly as harsh as in the book.

3226	Wsaharan	2014-04-18	Loras and Oberyn "flirting" was so damn wrong and unbelievable. It's like William Wallace going at it with The Prince of Wales.
Oh and the Kingsguard. Really? "Oh dear me, my king seems to suffocating, but the Lord Commander ordered me to stay at my post, so I shall. But maybe I better move anyway. No I have my orders. But on the other hand...
Oh nevermind, he's dead now. Oopsie."
Â 
And all the lords of Westeros just stand there like a bunch of nervous chickens. Maybe they wanted a "clean" shot of Joffreys death, what do I know.
3227	Metopheles	2014-04-18	Must try that some day.

Â 
I think they've already put him in a position though where his murder of Tywin will appear at least a little harsh, due to Tywin's more sympathetic portrayal. While they want him to be a good guy, it's already been established he's not perfect, and they'll want to keep that to an extent.

Why is Tywin more sympathetic portrayed ? He is the exact same as in the books. Most of his dialogue is exactly like in the books. I think the addition of other scenes with Tywin gives that effect, but he is still the exact same guy. I think sometimes that the book version is more sympathetic, especially in the last Tyrion chapter of agot and the chapter where he and Tyrion talk about the new valyrian swords.

Â 
His scenes with Arya gave him a new level of sympathy where he was shown to be fairly friendly and respectful to her. The impression given of him in the show is of someone who is heavily concerned with legacy and who is evil for a means, but who is perhaps not quite as evil as he is in the books. Not to say he isn't a fairly terrible person in the show; he clearly is, but I think they've gone for a more nuanced portrayal which is slightly greyer and allows viewers to feel some sort of level of sympathy for him.

Yeah the Arya scenes.. But what gives the impression he wouldn't have done it in the books too?
And I never caught that "evilness" about Tywin anyway. Roose Bolton is evil. Ramsay. But Tywin? He is strict and a war strategist. It's his job what he does.
Well, different perceptions I guess.

Â 
I actually like the show Shireen - especially as she was in S03. Having her as a bright light is a foil for the general darkness of Dragonstone. Not everyone is moping around after the defeat at the Blackwater.

I agree with this. Shireen is definitely the only good (excellent even) aspect of Dragonstone arc.Â 
The actress really nails the nuance in the character, lonely and melancholy but still has a bit of that sort of hopeful cheeriness you'd expect from a child.Â

Melisandre is perfectly played. As is Davos. You may not agree that they portrayed Stannis correctly, but definitely they got Melisandre right and Davos.

He wasn't being nice except as a strategy. Mho
3237	wolverine	2014-04-19	Ya. Â Tywin does whatever he feels needs doing to achieve HIS goals. Â I don't know that I saw him as an evil monster in the thread of Gregor or Ramsay who do evil because they enjoy it. Â He does evil because he is above everyone and it will get him to where he wants to be. Â He is still a complete egomaniacal prick but I could see him respecting other practical smart people, even if they are little girls.
Â 
PS: Â Charles Dance is fantastic.

2x05 "The Ghost of Harrenhal"
Â 
Margaery: Brienne of Tarth murdered Renly.
Â 
Loras: I don't believe that. You don't believe that. Who gained the most from our King's death?
Â 
Baelish: Stannis.

3239	Le Cygne	2014-04-19	We have a hint of Tywin's evil qualities in the premiere, Oberyn:
Â 
That started a war, and the war ended right here, when your father's army took the city. They butchered those children, my nephew and niece, and wrapped them in Lannister cloaks.Â Â  And my sister, you know what they did to her?...Â  What I keep hearing is that Gregor Clegane, the Mountain, raped Elia, and split her in half with his great sword...Â  But if the Mountain killed my sister, your father gave the order. Tell your father I'm here.Â  Tell him the Lannisters aren't the only ones who pay their debts.
3240	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-04-19	Here's me hoping we get more evil Cersei as well. She is insane but D&D have whitewashed her by giving her absolutely terrible and unforgivable crime of murdering innocent children to Joffrey.

3241	Queen of Whores	2014-04-19	We have a hint of Tywin's evil qualities in the premiere, Oberyn:

Hmm, something I just noticed reading this that I didn't when watching the scene is that Oberyn says Gregor killed Elia by cutting her in half with his sword, which is different from the books where Gregor says he "smashed her fucking face in," to quote the man himself. Does this mean 
	Spoiler Oberyn's death may be different in the show as well? I hope it isn't, because while it sucked seeing Oberyn die, especially in that fashion, it was so brutal and horrible that it added a lot of the shock of the scene, rather than a simple kill by sword. I hope it's kept the exact same in the show, because if there's one scene in the show that I think most people want exactly as it was on the books, I reckon it's this one.
3242	Metopheles	2014-04-19	We have a hint of Tywin's evil qualities in the premiere, Oberyn:
Â 


Tywin said he sent them to kill them. A thing Robert would have done, Jon Arryn would have done, any usurper would have done.
Â 
Maybe it's just me, but the chapters when the Lannisters speak about this thing, I think Tywin did not intend that the Mountain and Lorch did what they did. I mean how could he have known they would be such monsters? They were quite young at that time, maybe not known for their cruelty. But Tywin would never say "Oh I so regret that, I am so terribly sorry, never my intention". Even if it seems like it.
Â 
But sure y'all will disagree with me and attack me for this opinion. cheerio.

He knew because he had already used them to butcher the Reins of Castamere. Tywin knew exactly what his attack dogs were capable of.


But do you think, and this is my point, that he said to them
Â 
A: Go and kill those dragon spawn, smash them to the Walls and do what you want, just get rid of them
or
B: Kill the Targaryen heirs.
Â 
Because I think Tywin used them, because they wouldn't say "I don't kill women or children". a noble thing, but hindering when it comes to ending a line.
3245	TheKitttenGuard	2014-04-19	Â 
He knew because he had already used them to butcher the Reins of Castamere. Tywin knew exactly what his attack dogs were capable of.Gregor Clegane was not living when the R.O.C events occured in the books.  The show appears to place events later than the book based what Cersei said in 3x08 to Margaery but considering she is 40 Gregor will be in his '50s on the show.
If you go by Sandor's Lore on the Blu-Ray Tywin wanted House Clegane to be his attack dogs.  If that about right in the books then he knew full well what Gregor is capable of.
					
					
							Edited by TheKitttenGuard, 19 April 2014 - 10:58 AM.
3246	Metopheles	2014-04-19	Considering that Gregor's father covered the Sandor mess up, saying that his bed caught fire, and that Rhaegar Targaryen knighted Gregor...and that Gregor was 17 when he got the task..I doubt Tywin knew what would come of it.
Also no mention of the Castamere thing.
Â 
I think the image of Greg only came after the rebellion. Before that his stuff was covered up by his family, not Tywin, so nobody knew. He was only a giant and fine knight that got knighted by the prince himself, it seems.
Â 
Â 
EDIT: Yes. Greg wasn't even alive during the Reyne rebellion (260 AL) . He was born around 265 AL

Â 
I feel it is clear from the descriptions that Tywin "Ordered his men to sack the city" rather than capture the city, meant he had expectations that certain actions of violence were to take place and as House Clegane were his attack dogs, that Gregor in particular was to engage in such activities.

Well, a sad point is, all westerosi knights, noble as they are, when a city falls, they rape and plunder.

Â 
Yes indeed. My apologies. It appears the only references I can find at short notice are to "LannisterÂ and his men burnt and raped" the city. I have always misinterpreted it to be not in Tywin's character to get his hands dirty.
3250	Metopheles	2014-04-19	Don't twist my words around.
I never said that. But you failed to answer my question, do you think Tywin said he should kill them, or did he say "Go on, do what ever pleases your heart, smash some faces, rape the gal, whatever you want, as long as they are dead."
Â 
I think Tywin is far too smart to allow that. To order that. He knows the realm would fall if the Dornish lords would secede or rebel. He would not actively want them to be insulted and enraged.

Â 
I wasn't twisting your words, and I apologise if that was the impression that post gave.
Â 
My impression previously was that Tywin had in fact given an order to sack the city akin to his "Burn the villages, burn the farms" line. The quick search I just did provided no links to anything that suggested he gave such an order... All I found were references to "Lannister and his men..." in reference to the city.
Â 
Also, from your last line you are talking specifically about the events in the Red Keep? I'll go back to check again on that one.
3252	Metopheles	2014-04-19	kudos to you. At least you check stuff before you write it, unlike the majority of the people I discuss with. I mean that.

Â 
Yeah no problem. I understand that!
Â 
Also, I found a relevent passage in ASoS. Tywin and Tyrion are talking about how they are going to appease Oberyn. Tywin says he is going to lie and say Clegane had nothing to do with it and it was all Lorch's fault (Lorch was dead at this point). He goes on to say he did send the two of them to kill the babes but claims he didn't order the rape "I can't even remember if I mentioned the woman at all. I had more pressing matters to attend to"
Â 
Tyrion asks why he didn't just let Robert get his hands bloody instead and Tywin replied
Â 

Â 
Â 
We had come late to Robertâ<U+0080><U+0099>s cause. It was necessary to demonstrate our loyalty. When I laid those bodies before the throne, no man could doubt that we had forsaken House Targaryen forever. And Robertâ<U+0080><U+0099>s relief was palpable. As stupid as he was, even he knew that Rhaegarâ<U+0080><U+0099>s children had to die if his throne was ever to be secure. Yet he saw himself as a hero, and heroes do not kill children.
3254	Metopheles	2014-04-19	That's from the chapter I have my impression too.. So conclusion? Guilty or "innocent" of that particular act?
Â 
I say as a side note this is the greatest plot gift that any character I have read about so far, ever received. Noble, great Robert, fighting for love alongside his honourable friends. Destructed a line and usurped the throne without killing any important person, except Rhaegar, who was not the king at that time. All blame to the Lannisters though. Jaime the Kingslayer and Tywin the Babeslayer.
It was an action that needed to be done. Aerys had to die, same as the others. But who should do it..hmmm..not the Starks of course, neither Tully nor Arryn... I wonder what they would have done.. Lock them in a cell and wait until they die Â perhaps.
3255	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-19	The murders: guilty, he ordered it (specifically the infants, it is clear he sees Elia's murder as something of a side note and effectively doesn't care. Clearly not concerned about offence caused to Dorne)
Â 
Elia's rape: Not guilty of ordering, but guilty of aiding and abetting after the fact.
Â 
As for the side note - yep, he clearly sees the blame as the price he had to pay to garner the approval of the new management. He also sees it as a small price, because who is going to come and collect it? Nearly 2 decades later, Oberyn comes knocking so he is going to offer up a dead Lorch.
3256	Metopheles	2014-04-19	Just out of curiosity..the Darkstar mess.. Arianne's fault that Myrcella nearly lost her life and got mutilated? cause, you know, Darkstar is known for such actions, or rather his ruthlessness.
Â 
Â 
I think Gregor is just a total human failure. We see it perfectly at the trial by combat when he hacks down bystanders accidentally.
He is great for certain actions, a wonderful warrior and certainly the person I'd call to get revenge if my hand gets chopped off(sad that we won't get this in the series) and perfect for questionable acts. But always remember. He is the jar of pandora. Once released, all evil gets out and only hope remains.
The one big mistake Tywin did in his life, letting Gregor and Lorch do it. All his other actions to end wars were always so perfectly carried out, so smoothly and final, but this one always haunted him. And probably killed him, if one would believe the theory that Oberyn poisoned him.
3257	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-19	I took it to be that Arianne was being naive about Darkstar?

It seems that each of the Kingdoms might have their 'Wild Dogs' in various forms

It is worth nothing that all the lords sworn to Dragonstone declared for Stannis at a time when Stannis had the smallest army and had the smallest chance of victory. TRUE LOYALTY.
They had to declare for Renly since Robert skimped Stannis out of Storm's End succession. They merely followed their Lord Baratheon of SE and that was Renly. Simple.

Â 
Yeah, it's worth noting that the lords sworn to Storm's End followed the lord of Storm's End and the lords sworn to the Tyrells followed the Tyrells.
Â 
It's also worth noting that near four fifths of the lords and knights of the Reach and Stormlands went over to Stannis immediately after Renly's death.

A knight needs iron, but a king needs copper. With copper you can pay, with copper you can make things nice. It is good for jewelry and good for warfare. It is universal. You can use it for almost everything.
Iron is tough and hard. But that is not the king I want. That is too much of a dictator for me. A king needs to adapt and bend and bow for the people, not make the people bend and adapt to him.

Yeah in normal times, Renly and Marg would have been good for the realm and with a solid Hand, it would have been a gloriousÂ triumvirate that the Romans attempted twice.
Â 
But these aren't normal times. Winter is coming.
Â 
Robert was the perfect man for his time - winning the throne. But then his steel went to rust.
Â 
Stannis as the immovable iron was perfect for the defense of Storm's End and by implication to defend the realm against what is about to come. But has he over reached? Can he hold against two fronts? Will he be like Harold Godwinson - fought his way to the throne in a war of succession, then raced to the North to defeat the invasion of Harald Hadrada only to have to race all the way to the south to fall to the invasion of William the Bastard?
3277	Metopheles	2014-04-20	How is Robert perfect now? He got everybody in this mess. He is the reason the crown is bankrupt.
Tywin Lannister is "needed".
Money and food. Highgarden and the Westerlands, Dorne and the Vale. the ones that have resources, army and money.
Â 
And of course the Dragon lady. dragons are best to fight others. How does Stannis plan to do this? I mean kudos for rushing to the Wall, Switzerland, and forcing it to become pro-Stannis, whilst it has to remain neutral, but how does he plan to defeat them?
Anyway, he is dead anyway.

How was Robert so bad, though? Everyone keeps saying this - both in-universe and out - but I don't see the evidence. Sure the Crown got in a bit of debt, but there's a theory that Littlefinger was deliberately messing with the numbers. I don't see how the country could get in so much debt just for heaps of partying. In his rule he crushed a rebellion and no other conflicts came up. Yes he was a drunk, but his rule was a peaceful one (until the events of aGoT of course).
3305	Stormland's Fury	2014-04-20	He was bad by his own admission, but at least had the insight of letting the right people rule in his stead (well technically)

Anyway, sure his was a peaceful rule, people need a bit of time after a war. And 17 years after that all wounds are open again.
But if LF s game with numbers was all to bring down the realm, then Jon Arryn was a horrible Hand. How did he not see this? Ned saw that when he was Hand. How is it that Arryn had no power over his "son"?

yes, yes.
But even in the usurpation war, it needed the careful plotting of Arryn over years and years and waiting for the right moment, and then...Robert slew Rhaegar. That is his achievement. But Tywin won the war. He sacked the city and killed (let kill) the heirs. The rebellion was a lucky affair.

How come he didn't join Rhaegar into his little usurpation? Rhaegar wanted to take the throne by rallying the same lords as did Arryn...only.. then Arryn wouldn't have been Hand..so no reward for his failing House...Maybe Lord Rickard would have been the Hand if Lyanna married into Rhaegar's family.. convenient that it appeared that Lyanna was abducted and even more convenient that Rickard and Brandon got killed. Convenient for Arryn, to rally the Lords even against Rhaegar, and Arryn got his reward. win-win. Honour!

Â 
Because there was a little matter of Rhaegar causing Jon's plan to be shattered. He was attempting to unite the North and the Stormlands in the long term. Rhaegar and Lyanna tore the timeline to pieces. The usurpation by Robert wasn't the long game. It was a knee-jerk reaction to the events as they unfolded.

Actually it was. Robert the warrior as king to win and king to look, and Jon Arryn as the real king. Serving as hand but actually doing the shit. Like Tywin.
What do you think Arryn wanted ? Peace and prosperity for the realm just for fun? He wanted power to his extinct House. I mean it is noble to unite people against a mad king, but open your eyes, Arryn, Rhaegar did the same, join with him if you wanna be noble and do the right thing. But denying this, excluding Rhaegar...no. Interesting even further, that it took Rhaegar one year to let his lust lead him to Winterfell and abduct Lyanna...For me it is more likely she fled the arranged forced marriage and ran into Rhaegar..
3315	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-20	Arryn had certainly planned to lock up the North/Stormlands/Riverlands alliance before any such thing happened. The rebellion happenning when it did was quite clearly not in his plan. He may have also had other plans to try to tie the West and Reach together too. We may never know for certain. Tywin claimed Dorne only joined the Targaryens because Aerys reminded them he held a hostage.

This is the nitpick thread, and I get why the dog and pig weren't used (peta, trouble using them, ect.) but where was Penny? did the just not want to hire the part until next year? Was she that well hid? and who could even play the part? Meredith Eaton? She doesn't really look the part, but neither did Dinklage or Clark, until the make-up.Â 
Â 
The new Tommen isn't round, and might be to old for the part. I get they upped his age (like all the Stark Kids) but they have a Tommen that is almost old enough to marry, doesn't seem like he be playing w/ kittens, and to get the whole Dorne plot to put Myrcella on the throne, they will have to raise her age to around 16, and that is too old for the Arianne to lead around like she does.Â

It was made clear to them by their animal wranglers that the scene would have been next to impossible to construct. There were also huge liability/insurance issues to work through.Â 
Â 
There was no real reason to cast Penny at this point.
Â 
As for Tommen, the new actor is only about 1 year older than the old Tommen. All the children have been aged up. Book Tommen is about the same age as Bran and as we know Show Bran is approaching Hodor altitudes.

3323	Thelastactionhero	2014-04-13	So like many other Stannis fans I am quite upset by the rendition we witnessed tonight. I realize George R directed the episode, but I'm still curious as to whether or not he wrote the scenes, as rumor has it they were meant to be in the premiere rather than in episode 2.Â 
Â 
So here are my thoughts and questions, and I'm going to be as objective as I can possibly be given the circumstances. I feel that while Stannis as a religious pragmatist is ruined, and his moral ambivalence is thrown to the wind in regards to the Unsullied, that there might still be a kernel of hope for the character in the coming episodes. This comes from a devoted King's Man. My reason for believing this comes from Stannis' scene with his family, in which he tells his wife not to strike Shireen with the rod.Â 
Â 
Now, granted, as all of us book readers realize, Stannis burns the Florent in the book because he has secret plans to smuggle Shireen to the Lannisters and because he feels its perhaps the only way for them to reach the Wall in time to save the Night's Watch. While Alister is sympathetic in the books, Stannis' position is made more morally ambivalent by the circumstances, and thus the character suffers heavily from this episode's rendition of the events. Â 
Â 
All I can say to fans of the character who are as upset as I am, is that while the television series is very different from the book arc, there is still the potential for a redemption arc worthy of our captivation. It's important to note how heavily the show has embellished his love for Shireen, something that is much more subtle in the books. I feel that not only does this foreshadow future developments in Winds of Winter, but that it provides Stannis with the groundwork for a redemption arc that is meaningful and potent, even if he's been unnecessarily portrayed as villainous here.Â 
Â 
Something to consider, as readers of the book, is that we don't know the full story yet of who wrote the arc. If George did indeed write these scenes, it's something that fans of the character need to consider in their future readings. And yet even still, it's hard to argue that Stannis in SoS isn't more fleshed out and sympathetic than he's being portrayed here. If George is making a conscious decision to redirect the way he's adapted in the television series, fans need to respect that, but I don't think that fans of the books have been incorrectly interpreting his arc for no reason. We have reasons to sympathize with him as a character particularly in a Dance with Dragons, where Jon Snow frequently refers to him as "the King who still cared..."
Â 
I can't speak to where the show is going to go. I don't like where the character's direction is headed. All I can say is that we need to respect the show as a different medium and hope that the character's triumphs have the same moral and emotional weight as the failures they've ascribed to him in this episode. This isn't what I was hoping for, but its still too early to say Stannis has been given the treatment that Denethor was given by Peter Jackson.
3324	Lord Bronn Stokeworth	2014-04-14	I think the Stannis that Martin wants us to see in the books is still in the books regardless of who wrote/directed that scene. Unfortunately, Show Stannis is already a fanatic who burns men for being infidels. It makes more sense for Show Stannis to simply burning infidels as he usually does than give background on the man never before introduced explaining his treason (one that would be hard for him to commit since he is not Hand in the show). It makes it a bit awkward.
Â 
I do find it odd that they said it was Axel instead of Alister. I mean he's a fanatic in the book and now can't be introduce. I understand that some people take over others' roles (ie Gendry taking over Edric Storm's almost-sacrifice role), but that just seemed kinda pointless. Selyse can still have more brothers.
Â 
And really, Selyse suffered far more character assassination than Stannis this episode. She is not a pleasant person. But damn, do they ratchet up the crazy evil on the show.
3325	Darkbringer	2014-04-14	Yeah, its terrible alright. I feel that he is being made more morally questionable so that his trip to the wall becomes more of a twist, or at least I hope so. but its still a sucky thing to take the character so much lower than in the books.Â
3326	Pepi	2014-04-14	The name Alister takes longer to pronounce than Axel. And the time is tight. They're trimming all the fat they can in order to include an extra brothel scene or two.Â
3327	Pod The Impaler	2014-04-14	Less characters in the show overall. I guess Axell + Alister would be one Florent too many.
3328	Van West	2014-04-14	Stannis' scenes with his daughter really help him in staying at least mildly sympatheticÂ 
Â 
but the those religious burnings are just a disrespect to Book Stannis' character.Â 
Â 
Â 
At least in the books he burned his uncle in law for being a treacherous dick that was going to sell Shireen to the Lannisters.
Â 
Here he seems off put by it but he still goes through with it because they worship the New Gods making him way less pragmatic of a character. Also Davos worships the New Gods as well. Shouldn't Stannis burn him too? Makes no sense.

					
					
							Edited by Van West, 14 April 2014 - 03:12 AM.
3329	SkaggCannibal	2014-04-14	Yeah it sucked when Stannis said he was burning him because he was an infidel, I kept waiting for him to say he was a traitor too because that would make it ok. Never came.
Â 
Stannis telling Selyse she may not hit Shireen gives us a little hope for the future, but they do have to bring Selyse down to the level of crazy evil bitch instead of just the entitled, easily-manipulated dumbass she is in the books. No one wants that for a queen.

3331	Robbie Hood	2014-04-14	My reading of his character in this episode was that he was coerced into the sacrifice by Melisandre. He takes no pride in, nor gives the burning souls much attention. Whereas his wife and Melisandre are positively delighted.
I like Stannis in the TV show as he has a growing feeling of "uncertainty" in his actions, his beliefs are being questioned but he's too proud/stubborn to deviate from his path, as it's the only one he has.
3332	The Drunkard	2014-04-14	The dinner scene was alright, but the burning scene was predictably shit.Â 
Â 
Would've been better if they had Axell yelling out the "Not treason! Never treason!" defense he gave to Davos in the dungeon, and then have Stannis and Davos arguing over whether his treason deserved death as they walk away.Â 
Â 
The books had had the perfect line for show-Stannis, too.Â 
Â 
"He would even have given them Shireen. Mine only child, he would have wed to a bastard born of incest." The king's voice was thick with anger.
3333	ctid1977	2014-04-14	Spoiler Ach, he's still going to be the hero who saves the Nights watch at the end of this season, I wouldn't stress too much about his portrayal.
3334	The Kinkslayer	2014-04-14	Stannis needs some time alone with the smuggler and the pirate instead of dinner with crazy wife and red mistress
3335	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-04-14	D&D and their butchery continues. Their torrid portrayal of Stannis is still not fading away.
3336	Caesar Augustus	2014-04-14	I completely agree with this. They portray Stannis as such a dick in the TV show. 'Infidel'? Really? Stannis would never have used that phrase. Most of the Unsullied hate Stannis because they portray him so badly in the show.
3337	E-Ro	2014-04-14	When he used the word infidel I lost it. The episode was ruined for me.
3338	jons nissa	2014-04-14	My reading of his character in this episode was that he was coerced into the sacrifice by Melisandre. He takes no pride in, nor gives the burning souls much attention. Whereas his wife and Melisandre are positively delighted.


Â 
this was my interpretation of the scene as well. he was clearly not happy about while mel and selyse were very obviously in "rapture".Â

I like Stannis in the TV show as he has a growing feeling of "uncertainty" in his actions, his beliefs are being questioned but he's too proud/stubborn to deviate from his path, as it's the only one he has.


Â 
Â 
i like this too and i think this is how the showing is establishing all the hesitation stannis has in the books. he is not "eager" to do any of it and is much more remorseful. i think this is definitely creating a similar sense of inner conflict only the books tend to do it before the act and the show does it after.
3339	Mr Smith	2014-04-14	I was one of D & D's greatest critics regarding the Stannis of last season, but I actually didn't have too much to complain about in this episode. Their biggest mistake is that the burning should have been so that they'd have calm waters in their journey north, rather than "he was an infidel". However, the rest of the Dragonstone stuff was really good. I thought the dinner scene was excellent, and I didn't mind the Shireen and Mel scene much. They have time to turn it around.
3340	hollowcrown	2014-04-14	I guess they're building Stannis as some kind of creepy villain so we will be even more shocked when he turns up at the Wall and saves the day.
Â 
It's very eh though, just a problem because for 1.5 seasons now Stannias has been doing nothing but that's what happens in the book and you can't make stuff up.
3341	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-04-14	By ruining Stannis they are ruining Davos. One can understand why he belives in Stannis in the books. But in TV show? Why is he following a fanatic jerk????? 
In books he sees a conflicted Stannis who struggles between killing or not Edric while three kings die...a time between Davos wins most of it....and it is Stannis the one who pardons his treason. Not mel. The loyalty is more understandable.....his kid is Stannis squire and been teached with Shireen. Still has a wife and more kids and is building them a future.
Now Davos has no problem to follow a religious taliban who treats him like shit and has no good in him.
An other point I would like to adress is how the faith of Stannis in Melissandre is also poorly done. At this point Stannis belives in her because of two Shadow Babies, three kings daying with leaches, and good winds in his journey north. Whick makes it deeply understandable. Now the only thing that happened is that Renly died (which might had happened because one of his guards betrayed him, and Robb died in a carfuly plan built by Tywin.... 2 of Mels "miracles" against 8.
By the way I never got why Davos needed a freaking ship to carry mel and the shadow baby if Renly and Stannis (and Mel) met  at land  the day before.

Â 
I loved how Shireen asked difficult questions to Melisandre. You came to my room for a convert, what did you think - it will be an easy job.

There's also the fact that the show-runners know the end game. If this is their portrayal of Stannis, there's probably a reason for it, and it doesn't bode well for his supporters.

Â 
actually i thought it was always abundantly clear that davos' loyalty to stannis came from his gift of land and title which was then topped off with a promotion to hand, all of which benefit his family enormously. he had to struggle with stannis' actions in the books and he struggles with them in the show but he does believe that stannis has the best intentions for westeros with the exception of the religious stuff. that's straight from the books.
Â 
Â

so that we could understand what and how these deaths were committed. and so that davos would have no doubts about the red witch.
3345	aFeastForDragons	2014-04-14	I think D & D deserve a weekend in the Dreadfort after that terrible scene. Going out of your way to make a character look bad just really puts me off this show and ruined the episode for me.Â

Â 
I think if they wanted to keep the NW save a surprise, or make it more of a surprise, they've gone about it completely backwards. The season 3 finale effectively broadcasted that Stannis would be heading north, while the books kept it somewhat dubious. After looking through some of the Unsullied threads it seems a lot of the people talking about Stannis are surprised he isn't travelling there already.
3347	aFeastForDragons	2014-04-14	In Season 2 Stannis said to Davos his wife was at Storm's End.
Â 
They've completely ruined the surprise of him going to the Wall. He doesn't look to be in any rush either since burning the traitor was to speed up their trip to the wall.Â
3348	AdmiraloftheDothrakiSea	2014-04-14	The name Alister takes longer to pronounce than Axel. And the time is tight. They're trimming all the fat they can in order to include an extra brothel scene or two.Â

3349	JesterX	2014-04-14	The problem with cinema.Â  Clearly the Stannis scene was just an "ok, Stannis is still here" scene just to show him.Â  It really didn't add to his storyline at all.Â  They weren't even talking about getting to the wall.
3350	AdmiraloftheDothrakiSea	2014-04-14	I was hoping that when Selyse asked Stannis if he remembers the Siege at Storm's End he'd go on a massive rant about everything he'd suffered and how he was basically trapped now. Although i think we'll get some of that in the next ep. Part of the reason why book Stannis is so popular is because of his devotion to duty and the shit luck he's had. They already ruined it in season 2 when he had some great lines
3351	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-04-14	I really don't know what to say about it. Â Davos is one of my book faves and by mucking up Stannis, they muck up Davos' story. I really don't see why the are portraying Selyse the way that they do, but they lost me with her portrayal when they had the babies in the jars last season. Â So, I don't know...I'm not a Stannis fan, but I can definitely see why his fans would be pissed. The whole thing is really weird.
3352	aFeastForDragons	2014-04-14	The problem with cinema.Â  Clearly the Stannis scene was just an "ok, Stannis is still here" scene just to show him.Â  It really didn't add to his storyline at all.Â  They weren't even talking about getting to the wall.


Â 
I can imagine tons of TV fans wondering whats going on. Its almost as bad as skipping the battle of the fist and never mentioning anything about it again. Its just messy and lazy.Â 
Â 
90% of us posters could write a better scene and thats a fact, not an opinion.
3353	Dragon of Valyria	2014-04-14	Man, Stannis, come on. He could've come up with a better reason to sacrifice the Florent than that. He definitely comes across as a weary fantastic who is just desperate to try anything that'll work. It destroys any respectability he may have had. 
On the bright side, show Shireen is downright adorable and any scene with her is a joy. I loved seeing her contradict Melisandre. Nobody else stands up to her, except Davos.
3354	Guard of the Rainking	2014-04-14	Yeah this smells of D&D more than GRRM.
Why even have this scene, if they're not going to burn traitors or get better winds for the sail to the Wall. BTW according to SpoilerTV:
Â Episode 4.06 - The Laws of Gods and Men
Â Stannis and Davos set sail; Dany meets with supplicants; Tyrion faces down his father.Â 
So there might be a lot more Dragonstone stuff to come. Also in the S04E03 preview we see a Stannis and Davos scene arguing. And the set sail could be leaving from Braavos (would make a lot more sense timeline wise). I think that there's a good chance that Stannis is going to appear in 6 episodes this season.
The stuff where Stannis talks about Axell being an infidel was total BS. Here's hoping for a redemption arc.
3355	Fez	2014-04-14	I think the scene was fine. Sure he called them "infidels," but he didn't seem like he really believed it. Rather, it sounded like he was trying to convince himself that it was fine to do; and that's the important part. There just isn't time to properly introduce the idea that they were traitors, and to just say that they are is rather abrupt.

Â 
Sure there is. Â All you have to do is say they are traitors and give the treasonous reasons they are being burned instead of call them infidels and give the reason they are being burned as religious.
Â 
The audience is going to react negatively to anyone being burned alive, there is no need to throw in the extra layer of Stannis himself being a religious extremist, except that D&D don't like the character.

But he doesn't come off as a religious extremist. He comes off as a guy grudging going along with Mel because he doesn't know what else to do. And when talking to Davos, he sounds more angry that they disobeyed him rather than what it was they did.
3358	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-04-14	*insert character assassination diatribe here*
3359	protar	2014-04-14	Mixed feelings about Stannis this episode. Burning Axel and co simply for being infidels rather than outright treason from the books is yet another black mark on Stannis' character, but on the other hand it's lightened a bit by his foul mood going about it and his comment about Shireen. I think they're making Shireen the centrepoint of Stannis' softer side on the show.
3360	kakoserrano	2014-04-14	Stannis is my favorite character from the books, because he is, like myself, a purist of the "right". In the books he's certainly driven by Melisandre, because she proved to him that her faith is powerful (shadow brother killing and stuff). That's why in the book he tolerates (and that's the key word) Mel's burning shit. Have you stop to analyse Stannis intonation when he say's that the guy was a "infidel" in yesterday's scene? Did He really mean when he called the guy "Infidel" or was he "tolerating" Mel's burning shit again?
Â 
It's an honest question, because I really love the actor portraing him and I think that in his conversation with Davos he's merely repeating words and not believing in what he's doing. But it could be my love for Stannis seing things wrong.
Â 
Don't blame completely for my poor english. It's not my first language and I'm bad in the first one to begin with...

Â 
Agreed. I've said it before and I'll say it again: Stannis looked like a caged rat surrounded by religious fanatics in that scene. He is clearly not enjoying burning those people. He clearly doesn't believe in Rhllor with all his heart. Every conversation he's ever had about the Red God eventually boiled down to "don't really believe in him, but Melisandre's magic works, so who am I to argue?"
Â 
Also, things they kept when adapting his character:
- his devotion to his wife and daughter
- his his respect for and friendship with Davos (mostly, at least)
- his absolute no-nonsense attitude and rigidity
Â 
So unless they screw up his big moment at the end of this season, I'm fine with show Stannis.
3362	MyLittleDirewolf	2014-04-14	Stannis is not one of my favorites - book or show. In both though, I always got the feeling Stannis does not really believe in the Lord of Light, but he sees it as a means to an end. Doesn't he burn people when they are in the North though, for not converting to R'hllor? So maybe they are advancing that plot a bit with burning people now.
The behind the scenes with D&D for this episode sheds some more light on the intent behind the Stannis scenes. While watching it, I could hear the StanStans protesting. It's pretty clear it was not written by GRRM.
3363	RoamingRonin	2014-04-14	More upset with their portrayal of Selyse. I really wanted to hate her.

Â 
No. He burns either Mance or Rattleshirt for non-religious reasons, and he burns the three cannibals for their cannibalism and a potential murder (this is after refusing repeated requests from the queen's men to burn an unbeliever, by the way). The closest he comes to imposing religious restriction in the North is making the wildlings burn a piece of weirwood if they want to enter the realm.

Do you know where I could watch the behind the scenes video, by the way?

IIRC he burns Mance because he was a deserter and a few southern soldiers who turned to cannibalism during the march to Winterfell.
3366	David Selig	2014-04-14	Yeah, this was stupid. The showrunners are creating a very different and nowhere near as interesting Stannis than the one in the books.
Â 
And what's with the "they are in a better place now" and "Hell is here on Earth" nonsense? I don't recall this from the books, though I may be wrong, the Red God's religion has never interested me much. But Melisandre never talked souls in the books.
3367	Bold Barry Whitebeard	2014-04-14	I'm viewing this through rose-colored glass because I'm such a Stannis fan, but here are my thoughts:
Â 
"I told him to take them down and he disobeyed." - The reason he at least tells himself why they had to be executed.Â  I'm sure Mel and Selyse pushed for it because they're infidels, but at the end of the day, Stannis gave an order and it wasn't followed.
Â 
"I put up with a lot of things I don't like." - That's a zinger to the Red God and burnings right there!Â  At least, I hope so.
3368	Tori Targaryen	2014-04-14	I take the show version of Stannis as a highlight of where he's going ultimately. I wasn't fond of him in the books, and if anything, the show made me like him more than I originally did.
3369	Rooseman	2014-04-14	Â 



I'm not a Stannis fan, and I never really understood the complaints about Show!Stannis until last night. Even for me that was a bit over the top. Maybe they're doing it so his rescue of the NW will be all the more surprising?


Â 
Maybe, but that's a stupid reason.
Â 
They did a similar thing with the Red Wedding, where it all seemed much more pleasant, so the shock would be bigger when it finally happens. Even if I don't agree with that, I can understand it.

But with characters it doesn't work that way. You simply can't make him more despicable, so that his redemption will have a stronger effect. As Stannis himself said, a good act doesn't wash out the bad. So whatever he does when he comes to help at the Wall, he'll still be a man who burned people alive for not believing in the right god. You can't erase that.Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
"I told him to take them down and he disobeyed." - The reason he at least tells himself why they had to be executed.Â  I'm sure Mel and Selyse pushed for it because they're infidels, but at the end of the day, Stannis gave an order and it wasn't followed.
Â 

That would work, but they really didn't portray it that way. They should have let Stannis say "He disobeyed a direct order, I can't have that, he has to die" to really drive the point home thatÂ this was his reason. Not let him use the word "infidel"
Â 

Â 
Â 
"I put up with a lot of things I don't like." - That's a zinger to the Red God and burnings right there!Â  At least, I hope so.
Â 
Yeah I'm pretty sure about that. But what does that really say about Show-Stannis? He doesn't like it, yet he does not have the balls to tell them "No!" That does make him seem like Melisandre's bitch. Not sure if I'd rather have him be a bitch or an asshole, but preferably neither.
3370	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-04-14	I just gave up all my hopes about he saving the Watch. 
What D&D are doing probably has more to do with Jon and Mance almost reaching and understanding when Stannis comes and starts butchering all wildings, specially women and children.

Welcome!Â  
And I agree that Stephen Dillane is a very capable actor.Â  Perfect for Stannis imo, but few actors can come across as sympathetic if they have weak lines.
I am praying they don't allow Stannis to go back to that horrible desperate creature that was begging Melisandre for her 'favours'.Â  Man, that hurt my heart to see him portrayed in such a manner. I'm far from being a Stannis fan, but the man has serious backbone in the books, none of which was evident in his tv scenes.Â  Grr.

	Spoiler "She is my daughter. You will not strike her."
Â  or something to that effect, a few minutes after his snarky comment to Davos gave me hope that the Stannis we've read of is finally given a chance in the show.

3372	Sarah Lannister	2014-04-14	Stannis looked tired, and like he was just going through the motions during the burning scene.Â  Selyse's anger towards her daughter seemsÂ new.Â  I thought Selyse was more protective of Shireen, claiming thatÂ sheÂ was Stannis' heir.Â

bullshit
Â 
it wasn't a fine scene, not in the context of comparing to the book character and not even in a show only context
telling he is a traitor who tried to sell daughter to the lannisters behind his back takes all of 2 lines more, but we are cutting into Podrik or whatever the kid is called staring at the dancer time and that's just important development we can't miss 
Â 
I don't know why the fuck we have to rehash the same argument about motivations mattering every damn year, I'm not sure if people just don't understand or if they choose not to understand because the character in question is an antagonist to their favorite Dany or Tyrion
but MOTIVATIONS MATTER, end of story, him burning a guy because he is a non believer is completely different than him burning a guy because he tried to betray him by selling his own daughter, if people can't see that i don't even know what to say
Â 
but whatever, lets ignore the character assassinations of a book character and just look at it form a pure 100% show perspective
okay, here you have a guy, burning people because they follow a different religion (and that's the only reason every stated in the show)
but if you think about it, his hand, one of his most trusted advisers some dare say friend that is standing right besides him at said burning has multiple times openly proclaimed that he still follows the seven, how the fuck is that not problematic? it makes him into a giant hypocrite, that's bad writing even if we completely ignore the existence of the books, it will be even worse in season 5 or 6 when half his army will be made up by similar non believers
3374	Penguin king	2014-04-14	Why are people getting so worked up over that one word?

Thanks. I must have been confusing the queen's men's request and Stannis burning the cannibals, putting them together as one thing.
The behind the scenes is called Inside the Episode. I can find the one for S4E1 on YouTube, but E2 must not be up yet. If you have HBOGo (or a login to use) it's on there.
So far, they haven't had the queen's men in the Stannis plotlines. Which, I felt showed Stannis to be less of a fanatic, because at least he's not like those guys.

Except did HE burn them or was it Melisandre? Did Stannis allow the burnings because he feels that Melisandre is his only chance at claiming the throne.

3380	averde	2014-04-14	I watched show Stannis burn his brother in law alive for being an infidel. I don't think any character could recover from that kind of blatant evil. 
I'm not even that big a fan of book Stannis but all the great elements that make the character interesting and dynamic are gone. It would be the equivalent of show Theon having no love for the Starks from the very beginning and never being friends with Robb. It just ruins an entire aspect of that character that can never be recovered. 
I would also like to note that I found the whole infidel scene to be especially offensive because of the way American viewers will interpret Stannis after hearing it. After 9/11 and everything else in the Middle East infidel is a word most Americans know and attribute to "evil" people.

Â 
It seemed pretty obvious to me that Stannis was far less interested in the burnings than Mel and Selyse. He's got a look of distaste on his face practically the whole time and can't wait to turn away. Cut to him pushing away his roast meat in the very next scene. Dispite his flimsy justifications to Davos, he's clearly uncomfortable about the whole affair.
Â 
How anyone can look at the Stannis portrayed in this episode and see a religious zealot i've no idea. Everything about his behaviour, his expressions, his body language said the opposite. It's one word vs a mountain of subtext.

He could have easily called the man a traitor, instead they had him burn the man for being an infidel. How do you think all the American viewers saw that? It's almost offensive that they are at a point in the show that they want to invoke the current American "enemy" the Taliban in reference to Stannis as a character.
3383	Lord Commander Coulson	2014-04-14	I'm still holding out hope for Stannis, personally.
None of his more negative lines ever seem to be given with much conviction, I still feel like he's using R'hilor as a means to an end.
The only moment I would absolutely like to do without is the creepfest that was Melisandre's departure to find Gendry.

Very good point.Â  We won't know until we see more, but they have already said they'd be going to the Wall ... perhaps this part was just to set up the divisiveness that occurs once they get there, and how Stannis does draw a line to show he's not a fanatic and he'll only allow them to go so far to show their devotion.Â Â
3385	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-04-14	By the way, stop using him not leting Selyse to beat Shireen as a good trait or a bone throwen to us. 
We are like Reek, happy because at least they gave us a scene were Stannis decides his daughter is not going to suffer child abuse. Something that can be asumed from all other normal characters.
It looks like Hitler having a scene were he shows a soft side for dogs.

yes, book stannis realizes that the red god has certain powers that he has seen, but that's why when presses for a burning he chooses someone that has already fucked up, instead of burning someone for being a non believer while a non believer stands at his side


Â 
I considered this a very, very big distinction, D&D apparently, don't or as many believe, they dislike the character immensely and so as much as they have whitewashed the ones they like, they've done the opposite with Stannis.
3389	Widows_Blood	2014-04-14	I watched show Stannis burn his brother in law alive for being an infidel. I don't think any character could recover from that kind of blatant evil.
I'm not even that big a fan of book Stannis but all the great elements that make the character interesting and dynamic are gone. It would be the equivalent of show Theon having no love for the Starks from the very beginning and never being friends with Robb. It just ruins an entire aspect of that character that can never be recovered.
I would also like to note that I found the whole infidel scene to be especially offensive because of the way American viewers will interpret Stannis after hearing it. After 9/11 and everything else in the Middle East infidel is a word most Americans know and attribute to "evil" people.


You're not even stating what was interesting and dynamic with Stannis in the books, so what exactly is lost? I literally haven't seen a single person equate Stannis using the word infidel with him being a Taliban like extremist. Just like I have never seen a non-book reader think Stannis is evil. Most of the people I talk to about him think Stannis is a grumpy/hardass/awkward guy. Nowhere will you see people compare Stannis to the Taliban. This is once again manufactured outrage by people who have a messiah complex with Stannis. They build the character up in their head to be one thing and then lose their marbles once the show version does not exactly fit that mold. Â

Â 
Same way they don't see the horrible selfish character Dany is. Instead they portray her as the second coming of Christ. Although the last episode finally had her advisors finally say some bad points about her but they were so subtle the audience might not have picked them up.
Â 
They are approaching the series as an opinionated fan rather than having a neutral view. They overhype certain characters while making others look bad. I think its unfair that Stannis is constantly brought up when Jon was very badly portrayed in season 3. He's just know as the depressive moaner who knows nothing now. Â

of course, ive never heard of him being called a "taliban" haha. I dont have many friends who watch the show but its very clear, atleast to them, that hes A bad guy. "messiah complex" hardly bro, most of us are pretty much in agreement that he's not perfect and that things are gonna most likely gonna end up bad for him. He's not complex is probably the biggest beef the "stans" have right now. There is nothing to his character, really!

Â 
Even from purely practical point of view burning people for refusing to convert is a terrible idea. How does Stannis hope to win the throne of a realm where nobody except few thousand people on Dragonstone follow other religions? Who would support him if it is known that he burns people who refuse to convert?

Most agree that he's at least more dynamic and interesting than he's being portrayed on the television show. if nothing else Stannis has way more nuance in the books, and I don't think that's debateable whatsoever, even if you don't like his character.

Â 
Actually, watching this made the whole "infidel" kerfuffle make more sense to me. They seem to get that he's a pragmatist, and to him, "trying things Mel's way" and fully accepting her god is a means to an end. I see why you view it as negative but this made that scene more sympathetic to me.
3402	northernmonkey	2014-04-14	I still don't see show Stannis a a religious zealot. He never seems to say any of his lines with much conviction, and when Mel or Selyse say something religious he seems to be suppressing his contempt for them.Â 
Â 
I'm a massive Stannis fan in the books, but I'm under no illusions - book Stannis is an absolute arsehole who burns people alive, but I like him despite all that. So I don't have a problem with D+D trying to make him a more dislikeable character, because he's not supposed to be a nice guy. It's testament to GRRM's brilliant writing that we all love Stannis despite him being a complete twat, and I love show Stannis as well.
3403	aeu	2014-04-14	Â 
But he doesn't come off as a religious extremist. He comes off as a guy grudging going along with Mel because he doesn't know what else to do. And when talking to Davos, he sounds more angry that they disobeyed him rather than what it was they did.


Â 
This.
Â 
Â 


Â 
It's an honest question, because I really love the actor portraing him and I think that in his conversation with Davos he's merely repeating words and not believing in what he's doing. But it could be my love for Stannis seing things wrong.
Â 
Â 


Â 
And this.
Â 
Â 


Â 
Agreed. I've said it before and I'll say it again: Stannis looked like a caged rat surrounded by religious fanatics in that scene. He is clearly not enjoying burning those people. He clearly doesn't believe in Rhllor with all his heart. Every conversation he's ever had about the Red God eventually boiled down to "don't really believe in him, but Melisandre's magic works, so who am I to argue?"
Â 
Also, things they kept when adapting his character:
- his devotion to his wife and daughter
- his his respect for and friendship with Davos (mostly, at least)
- his absolute no-nonsense attitude and rigidity
Â 
So unless they screw up his big moment at the end of this season, I'm fine with show Stannis.


Â 
Â 


Why are people getting so worked up over that one word? Stannis has always paid lip service to the Red God It's a key part of his character.Â  He sticks a symbol of rh'llor on his family crest,Â  brandishes a magic sword, burns septs, and forces conversions and no one bats an eye lid. But he calls a man an Infidel and suddenly his whole character is ruined....
Â 
What am i missing here?


Â 
Â 


Â 
Â 
It seemed pretty obvious to me that Stannis was far less interested in the burnings than Mel and Selyse. He's got a look of distaste on his face practically the whole time and can't wait to turn away. Cut to him pushing away his roast meat in the very next scene. Dispite his flimsy justifications to Davos, he's clearly uncomfortable about the whole affair.
Â 
How anyone can look at the Stannis portrayed in this episode and see a religious zealot i've no idea. Everything about his behaviour, his expressions, his body language said the opposite. It's one word vs a mountain of subtext.


Â 
Â 
And these...
Â 
Â 


He could have easily called the man a traitor, instead they had him burn the man for being an infidel. How do you think all the American viewers saw that?Â 


Â 
Â 
If they had half a brain, they saw what the posters quoted above saw. Â I talked to 3 non-readers today. Â None of them even remembered the word "infidel." Â What they got out of that scene was that Stannis was not into the burning at all. Â Two of them said that "The actor actually does a great job of showing that he doesn't really like this or buy into this." Â 
Â 
Now, people think that Stannis wants power, so he is playing along. Â This is quite a departure from the book in terms of motivation (want has nothing to do with it, after all), but I'm afraid that shipped sailed a long time ago. Â TV Stannis is motivated by different things than the book Stannis. Â But he is not a religious zelot. Â 
Â 
As someone who absolutely loves Stannnis (at least until ADWD), I think that this was an excellent episode for Stannis given how he was developed so far on the show.

Â 
Yea I was initially at peace with the whole thing because I thought Stannis was reluctant to go along with the burning -- "There are a great many things I hate but I suffer them all the same" during the dinner scene seems like it's directed right at Mel -- but D&D here imply he's totally on board with religious purging if it gets him to the Iron Throne. Even readers who don't like Stannis can see that he's uncomfortable with the Lord of Light.Â 
Â 
Here's a question tho': can someone tell me why they rushed his decision to burn Gendry? Remember, the deal in the show & books was 3 leeches for 3 kings. Book Stannis waited until the last king fell before deciding Edric Storm needed to die; Show Stannis couldn't wait to kill Gendry after just Robb Stark died. We're on ep3, Joffrey is dead, andÂ Stannis hasn't advanced anywhere in his story. You could have easily delayed the decision to go north until Joffrey/Balon died. Stannis could be making the decision to burn GendryÂ this weekÂ and it would've made no difference to the showrunner's plans, really

actually most don't agree on anything when it comes to stannis (or practically any of the other characters). all the characters have more depth in the books than in the show, even the show favorites. so if we remove that, show stannis is where he was in the books at this point. his scene do show an interesting man and with the exception of the beach scene with melisandre, capture the big book scenes of his story. his scenes interactions with selyse are a different matter though. now that you guys could and should complain about but no one seems to care.

It's not just about depth. The context for events such as these burnings are radically different on the show than they are in the book, and they reflect very poorly on him as a character. These notions of duty and hard justice have been cast entirely to the wind for religious fundamentalism and lust for power. Stannis is certainly no angel in the book series, but I think it's more than clear that they've taken him to all new low with this episode. I find it funny that you think none of the complaints are justified, considering that even his motivation for going to the Wall has been changed as a result of episode 10. He says himself in the books that Davos reminded him of is duty, something that won a lot of us over because Stannis finaly realized what being a king actually meant. Here, he goes to the Wall because of Melisandre's urging, and only spares Davos because she tells him to. So yeah, we'll see what happens when he goes to the Wall, but I find it hard to believe that his arc is going to be anything but terrible after watching last night and listening to D&D's justifications for where they've taken him.
3411	Ran	2014-04-14	I'm with aeu. Stannis's main beef with the Florents is that they disobey him when he says he wants the idols torn down. Why does he wants them torn down? Because someone seems to convince him that he needs to consolidate his hold on Dragonstone by reinforcing his R'hllorianism and removing people who dissent strongly enough that they actually refuse his commands. Had the Florents just quietly gotten rid of their idols, nothing would have happened, but like the Rambtons they decided to make a stand against Stannis... and paid the price. Stannis can't afford any dissent right now.Stannis's line about his hating many things, but tolerating them just the same, strikes me as an explicit remark on what happened before: he doesn't particularly care to be burning these people, but he tolerates it because he believes it's one of the only recourses left to him as he tries to figure out what to do next.
3412	The Abominable SnowOther	2014-04-14	Â

Â 
Stannis in both the show and the book is plagued by whether to do the right thing or do whatever it takes to win the crown.Â  And maybe because you can justify it in the books because of some 'get out of jail free' clause where kings can freely burn traitors (a la the mad king), maybe the reason you're pissed w/ this scene isn't because D&D are portraying him incorrectly, but that the way he is being portrayed truly shows some of the dark things he orders.Â  I never understood the whitewashing of some of these traits.
3415	TheFullmetalAlchemist	2014-04-14	I completely agree with this. They portray Stannis as such a dick in the TV show. 'Infidel'? Really? Stannis would never have used that phrase. Most of the Unsullied hate Stannis because they portray him so badly in the show.


Â 
True. I actually hate Stannis in the show, and I actually wonder why he hasnt had Davos killed yet. He just seems like that type of guy. Stannis is still a Â great character in the books, D&D cant touch him there, thank God.Â

Â 
There's also the fact that the show-runners know the end game. If this is their portrayal of Stannis, there's probably a reason for it, and it doesn't bode well for his supporters.


Â 
They also said they thought Renly would be a great king, and that hate Stannis. I think bias is more likely than they know the end.

What am i missing here?



Because in this case, one word changes the entire scene motivations. Rather than executing people for treason, he was killing them for believing in the wrong gods which are very different things.
Â 
I'm not bothered by the word "infidel." I'm bothered that Stannis killed people for worshiping the wrong god regardless of whether he is a "true believer" or if he is just doing it for pragmatic reasons.
Â 


How can they hate Stannis though? They read the books. Why don't they see the interesting and dynamic character everyone else sees?


Â 
Because he killed Renly? I remember the interview where they were talking about how horrible he was, they said Renly would make a great king. Of course, it was during Season 2.
Â 
Â 


Â 
But everyone doesn't see the characters in the same way. Â I don't see Dany as Targaryen Jesus, LOL, but D&D give every impression of seeing her as a straight up savior figure. Â So, there is no reason they have to see that the good in Stannis outweighs the bad, they probably don't "hate" him, but their take seems to err on the side of negativity, TV Stan is weaker, less decisive, and more rash and much less "just" than Book Stan, at least by my count, and I'm not even really a Stannis fan.


Â 
It's the white savior trope where a white person comes in and solves everyone problems.
Â 
Book!Dany is a deconstruction of this and shows us why it is a bad thing. Each city kinda represent a different form of it. Asatapor, killing the bad guys and leaving. Yunkai, making the bad guys "stop." And of course, Mereen is occupation.
Â 
It's actually a pretty awesome takedown of a very racist trope that tells people brown people would be so much better off listening to white people.
Â 
Unfortunately, Show!Dany is playing this trope straight.
Â 
((I do want to say that I don't think D&D are racist. But I think they love Dany and whitewash her, which unintentionally makes make the trope played straight. However, since most of the consequences of Dany's actions shouldn't have happened yet in the show, they could easy still show us the "white savior is a bad thing.")

As a person that has had family affected by the events on 9/11 who also happens to love stannis, hearing this pissed me off. Its clear that the showrunners are going out of their way to make Stannis look as bad as possible. They have gone so far as to ADMIT the bias openly.You know this is a real issue when you have people that dont even like stannis take issue with it. Then of course you have the people that will defend the show no matter what lend their two cents with strawmen about people complaining. A great example in these posts:D&D personally hate me and this is why they butcher Stannis.It is a personal vendetta against me.You're not missing anything. Just ignore the usual reactionaries.We can all agree(except for the people that posted this nonsense of course) that these posts add nothing to the discussion, and exist merely to hand wave other peoples opinions on the matter.
3420	Guard of the Rainking	2014-04-14	Just watched the inside episode video. If Stannis is going to be in the "do whatever Melisandre says to get the Iron Throne that I've always lusted for" mode by the end of the season then the show Stannis is irredeemable. Even though D&D know the ending of the series I'm not making the assumption that Stannis will become a villain in the last two books. Don't get me wrong there's a big possibility for that to happen in the books, but right now it seems like that D&D are going with the "bare bones, black and white, Dany wanking, cannibal Thenning, whitewashed Tyrioning, sexpositioning, book spoiling, seven season long" version of the story. Even if he becomes a villain he was still an awesome grey character during most of the story, and there is no good reason to blackwash him.
I had some hope for the character to be redeemed after the third season. That hope twindeled after I watched the second episode and has almostÂ extinguished after I watched the inside episode video. Fingers crossed that it gets better.
3421	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-04-14	I expect no other thing than stannis butchering wilding women and children just when Jon Snow is almost reaching a paceful agreement with mance.
Perhaps with SW imperial march as soundtrack.
3422	Areo Speedwagon	2014-04-14	Well, aeu summed up and quoted the majority of where I'm at with the whole Stannis situation.
Â 
And kudos to the OP for making good on the title of the thread.Â Â 
Â 
I also see a Stannis that is very much tolerating his current situation.Â  People have said the fact that since Davos worships the Seven, his being not roasted for being an infidel is a continuity problem.Â  But I see it as further proof that Stannis' heart isn't in what he's doing.Â  That it's about the fact that these "offerings" seem to work.Â  Now, that doesn't change the fact that this whole scene really kind of felt like a repeated beat, just more of the same.Â 
Â 
While Stannis does have the letter from the NW, and therefore his purpose, it still seems like his focus is very much the Iron Throne.Â  And that's fine.Â  That's a corner he still has to turn.Â  I think (well, hope) that sometime in the next few eps we'll get the epic "cart before the horse" bit from Davos. Â  I think (hope) that moment will do away with a lot of frustrations as many people have said they felt in S3E10 Stannis wanted to go North because of Mel, not Davos.Â  Well, they haven't left yet.Â  I think if they pull off the "cart before the horse" scene, especially with where Stannis is mentally,Â  it could be very powerful for both Stannis and Davos.Â 
Â 
I think Stannis has to, and we have to see him, fully abandon the quest for the IT.Â  It's the last "threshold" he has to cross.Â  And I think (again, hope) that moment is coming.

Â 
On a serious note if they don't shout Stannis then it is 100% undeniable proof that they hate his character and are trying to sabotage his heroic moment.
3424	kakoserrano	2014-04-14	I really don't see Stannis beig portrait as a pure vilain. Vilains in this show (and on the books, until the author changes his mind) are veeery vilains and show no sign of good in them. Tywin, Cercei, Jeoff, they are vilains. Stannis in the books is a confused man (in te Show too) with very straight ideas of what is the "right" (not in the Show yet) to do. That's a problem because seeing the show we know that he's not all bad but he strikes as a weak person with little convictions. That can easily be fixed, IMO.
Â 
But, if we want to discuss water under the bridge, the scene that could have saved all that debate would be the conversation between him and Renly before the battle that never hapened. That exchange between the two is by far the best chapter in this inconsistent series of books. And that chapter made of Stannis my favorite.
3425	Lord Damian	2014-04-14	To be honest, I never liked Stannis, the book Stannis was an asshole but when he started burning people, I thought HERETIC. The only time I felt any admiration for him is when he decided to listen to Jon Snow and do as he suggested and took the war to Roose Bolton. any other time, I cannot stand him. He was right to want to WANT punish Renly but kinslaying is different.

3426	acosta	2014-04-14	I've always been a Stannis fan and that was even though I saw most of the first three seasons before ever opening one of the books. This forum seems to badly overestimate how evil he is perceived as. As he explains to Davos, it's pretty damn hard to deny that the god he is serving is real and he is the lawful king. He takes some extreme measures that push moral boundaries, but he's also the only of the original five kings still living. The graveyards of Westeros are full of honorable, just, merciful men. The throne is not.Â 
Â 
I also don't understand why people are expecting it to be a surprise when he goes to the wall. He already made that decision in "Mhysa" when Davos reads him the letter from the Night's Watch and Melisandre says the true war is to the north, with the only enemy that matters. After that, I halfway expected this season to just scuttle the remainder of the Dragonstone storyline and push the battle for the wall and his movement way forward until they released the episode schedule.Â
3427	sati	2014-04-14	I wouldn't say it's surprise he goes there, but it's a surprise that he makes it in time.
3428	Belisarius09	2014-04-14	When they had him use the word infidel I about flipped the table.
Â 
Now, after a second viewing, I think that may have been more of a knee jerk reaction.Â  Stannis looked particularly glum during the burning and didn't want to hear from Selyse about how beautiful it all was.Â  He isn't interested in the religious humbug.Â  I feel like his answer to Davos is the only answer he had ie: "Melisandre wanted to burn them, she promised me it would help my ships get north, so for this to make any sense to anyone else, like davos, I'll just tell them its because they're infidels"Â  If they were traitors it might have made more sense to behead them.Â  The justification for "burning" would be the religious heresy.Â 
Â 
Now some of this hopeful re-examination is undone by stannis explaining "they didn't tear down their idols".Â  I can't repair everything about this fuckup by the show writers, but i can mitigate the damage in my mind.Â  Because...
Â 
At dinner Stannis says he hates a great many things, but he suffers them all the same.Â  I feel/hope he may have been referring to the burnings.Â
3429	Konradsmith	2014-04-14	I really liked Stannis's time in this episode. The way that D and D describe it in the "Inside the Episode" video is very measured actually. Yes, he's committed himself more to Mel's ways but its still practically-motivated. It's true that he never accepts this much of her ways in the books (and of course all of this is off-screen/invented stuff anyways)Â but it made for a well-written, well-acted scene. It was obvious that Stan had disdain for his wife's mumbo-jumbo and that he uncomfortable and unimpressed by the ritual anyways. That was clear in Dillane's bearing throughout the beach scene. His use of the word "infidel" obviously drew a lot of your ire, but he was quick to explain the real reason; the guy disobeyed him.
Â 
Also he had some of his best lines yet in the dinner scene. "I hate a good many things but I suffer them all the same" is a great one for instance. Dillane pulled if off really well, especially him fiddling with his food and his curt responses to Selyse. Those of you who are in panic mode ought to rewatch the episode and calm yourselves.

I wonder how bad the adaptation of Stannis has to get before the forums stop painting us as paranoid whiners. On the plus side, how much better does Season 3's take on the character look by comparison? lol. I don't know if it can get any worse than this, despite my hopes that they give him a good redemption arc.
3433	Rapsie	2014-04-14	My unsullied other half considers Stannis to be a villain. 
They have cut most of Stannis' best lines and his moral quandaries. Having Axel burnt because of faith rather than treason is a huge change in character motivation. 
It is almost as if D&D think as long as we get from point A to B in the story it is a faithful adaptation, regardless of the characters and their journey.

Wait for Stannis to claim he needs his plans to evolve.
Â 
Â 
Anyway, I think I'm keeping my comments about Stannis until he actually reaches to his triumphant moment. I think that scene will be the breaking point of Stannis' fate and future in the show. And DD are just setting him up to it.
Â 
IF by that time, half the viewers are chanting "Stannis! Stannis! Stannis!", well... hah hah.

3441	Konradsmith	2014-04-14	Dillane doesn't play him villainous and at the worst, the writers are positioning him as an anti-villain. I don't even think they're doing that, but clearly all of you all do, so I won't press that point too hard.
Â 
I've said this many times, but I like show Stannis best because he is Stephen DillaneÂ instead ofÂ a bald bearded fellow voiced by Roy Dotrice. Dillane imbues everything with nuance, whether or not its on the page (I happen to think it is, but again, you fellows don't so there's no point stepping in just to contradict you).

Thanks (wonder why they don't post on youtube, grr).
Â 
So, after having watched that video, I really dislike their comments.
Â 
"The beginning of this season we've come across Stannis having gone full-Melisandre." That's exactly how we came across him last year, right down to the burning of infidels (albeit off screen). Did season 3 serve no purpose, then, if he's the same bloody character he was ten episodes ago?
Â 
The insistence on his "obsession with his birthright" isn't great either. Stannis is obsessed with a lot more than just taking the throne, why single out this in every second interview?

The thing is, he never burns anyone for lack of belief in Rhillor to begin with, so this is a shift that shouldn't be there in the first place. Though we never see how the voyage actually goes, his praise and acknowledgment of Davos' wisdom when he finally saves the Wall indicated for me that he gained back a fair bit of autonomy as soon as he's shown the letter from the Night Watch, because it was at that moment he remembered what a king's duty actually is. In this interpretation this fidelity towards duty has been cast aside in favor of pure lust for power. We might see a shift eventually, as you suggest, but I think much of the arc is permanently tainted now.

3448	juanml82	2014-04-14	My reading of his character in this episode was that he was coerced into the sacrifice by Melisandre. He takes no pride in, nor gives the burning souls much attention. Whereas his wife and Melisandre are positively delighted.


It may seem so. He's upset about the burnings. But if that's the way it works and he can't even rule his own keep, who does he pretend to rule the Seven Kingdoms?

Â 
The Sunglasses and Rambtons would disagreeÂ  
Â 
But yeah, I see your point. They've been with this thing of burning infidels since the beginning of season 3, and not one mention that Alester Florent wanted to go all Operation Valkyrie on Stannis' ass. That would make Team Dragonstone more sympathetic and would provide a bit more intrigue on that storyline, which it sorely needs.
3450	Gannicus	2014-04-14	He's clearly been molded by D&D to be more fanatical. Â I wish we could just ask them why. With so many characters being made more sympathetic, WHY do they need to turn him into a darker religious figure??
Â 
I think Dillane does a great job with the material he's given. Much of Stannis' character comes through but it's hard to argue that he hasn't been made more of a villain.
Â 
The coolest thing about Stannis is that he does not bend. Â Well in the show he bends for Mel every damn episode. WTF.
3451	hiemal	2014-04-14	Stannis didn't burn them for their beliefs, he burnt them for disobeying his order to remove their shrines to the Seven; or at the very least that is the face he has put on it. He's as pragmatically hard-arsed as ever.

True, but they're the only ones that openly defy him for his beliefs. But yeah, of all the people's he's burned, they were the only ones who one could argue really didn't deserve it, and even Mel burned some of them while Stannis was away, but in the show everyone he's burned are infidels

3456	Konradsmith	2014-04-15	What they've done is delay Stan's softening to Davos from late season 3, where it would have been placed according to book canon, to the mid-season of s4. They've done this to give him something more to do this year, not out of spite towards the character. 
	Spoiler  Gran de Lys, the critic who answered questions about the first 3 episodes she'd seen as screeners, said that its Davos who comes up with the idea of going to the Iron Bank. We know the trailers that they DO go. Instead of having the Wall letter being Dave's victory, they've made this be. 

Â 
We know that he appears less this season, or at least Mel does, than in previous seasons according to an interview with the lovely Carice van Houten. We also know however that he appears next episode and in episode six. It is likely that he will also appear in episode four because Bryan Cogman wrote it and he was in charge of the Stannis storyline last year. This leads me to believe that Stan will open up do Dave in these appearances and that this will mark the movement away from Mel's ways that many of you expected to be at the end of last season. I don't know if we'll hear Dave say the "cart before the horse" speech to Stan or if we'll simply hear it via Stannis to Jon, but if only to give Liam Cunningham and Stephen Dillane something to do in their next two to three appearances, we will have that "thaw" between the bros.
Â 
I hope this allays some of your fears about the adaptation. I still defend the effect that these sorts of plot mechanics have on his characterization, but obviously you all won't as eagerly "buy" the changes.

3457	bent branch	2014-04-15	The show is an adaption and many of the characters are going to be different than their book versions. Show Jorah and Book Jorah are so different that I had to simply accept that there were two different Jorah's and be done with it. However, there is one aspect of Stannis' storyline that bothers me.
Â 
In the books, Stannis is aware of the greater threat that the others pose to Westeros. In fact, I can't think of any other group of people besides Stannis' and those at the Wall who are aware of this threat. After Blackwater, Melisandre shows Stannis in the flames what the true threat is because Stannis just wants to give up on taking the throne. Stannis continues trying to get the throne because he thinks that he needs to take the throne so that he can rally Westeros to meet this threat. After Stannis receives the letter from the Nightswatch he realizes that the threat is here now and not something that is coming in the future. It is at this point he heads straight to the Wall. Once at the Wall, the actions that Stannis takes are designed to calm the North so that he doesn't have an enemy at his back to that he can face the threat coming from the North.
Â 
Yes, Stannis is a prickly, difficult man. How he is presented is probably going to be controversial, but I don't think his storyline is being revealed very well. I wonder how many people who only watch the show are aware of how Stannis' motivations have changed. Hell, I wonder how many people who have read the books understand how Stannis' motives change after Blackwater. Sometimes in the arguments about if Stannis is a good or bad person, I think the storyline is lost.
Â 
Just my two cents.
3458	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-15	After I rewatched the scene in question, I guess the burning was the less important things to be noticed, really. It's the catalyst, yes, but the next scene is the important one and it's not there just for us to see the Baratheons enjoying a very awkward meal. The whole scene is about Stannis and Shireen. Look.
Â 
- Stannis is clearly disgusted by everything around him, including Davos. Shireen is not there, though. He probably doesn't want her around the whole mess that it's his life. Shireen's absence means to me that for Stannis, the world now is divided in two things: everything he hates and Shireen. And Shireen doesn't mix with the things he hates.
Â 
- Selyse also disgusts him. He didn't say it with words, but he's pretty much implying that she might be his wife but that's all. She even tries to recall what she might perceive as a caring act of Stannis, but he barely reacts to the memory: "of course I remember", like "well, duh, I was there".
Â 
- She changes the conversation to the lord of light and Stannis is all "meh". He pays attention when Selyse baits him with something she knows he cares: Shireen, and then she calls her a "stubborn little beast". That doesn't sound like something she would say simply because Shireen refuses to "convert". To me, it looks like she actually dislikes the girl, maybe because of the greyscale, maybe because she's a girl. Or maybe...
Â 
- Selyse states that Stannis thinks Shireen's sweet because she smiles at him. While in the previous dialogue is clear that Stannis barely pays attention to his wife besides his marital duties of feeding her and keeping her safe, Shireen doesn't need to do anything but to smile to have Stannis' attention and love, something Selyse doesn't have.
Â 
- Selyse also calls Shireen "sullen, subborn and sinful". She's pretty much describing Stannis right there. It's Selyse the one who doesn't know Stannis.
Â 
The whole scene is quite symbolic because of the dialogue and the food scenery: Selyse is starving from Stannis' favour and she's unable to provide him with anything he likes ("the meat's off, get something else"). She even got him a women who promises him being King and he's still unhappy. Stannis complains about the food while Selyse simply eats it in silence and tries to do her best with the few she has: that's their marriage. And when Melisandre speaks of suffering hunger as a child until the Lord of Light found her, that's Selyse right there, being hungry of something else (love) until Melisandre found her.

D&D apologists will always find some bs to talk down the Stannis' butchering, as usual. Every time this happens. D&D always fuck up Stannis and their apologists defend that how it makes sense and all other bs.Â 
D&D's hatred for Stannis shouldn't be denied at this point, i mean that Inside Episode 2 says it all.Â 
They should just kill him in the first episode next season and be done with this mockery.
One Realm. One King. One God.Â

3464	Darkbringer	2014-04-15	Rambtons and Sunglasses were burnt by Selyse, while Stannis was away. he didn't order it.
3465	DemiNymph	2014-04-15	It's true that the show writers hate Stannis. It has been going on since Season 1. It's so unfair to him. I don't love Stannis but this is such a deliberate smear on his character. When I watch his part I feel like the writers are like tabloid writers in trashy newspapers out to deliberately change the context of what happened to smear someone, lol. Thumbs down.Â
3466	Charles Phipps	2014-04-15	I don't understand anyone's objections to Stannis' portrayal in the show. Stannis Baratheon is a figure who has a very clear character arc in the books which is replicated in the show. Stannis is the unloved, unappreciated, unimportant Ultimate Middle ChildTM. No one loved him as much as Robert and Baby Brother Renly. Mel is the first person who ever shows Stannis the possibility of being something better, "Hey, you're actually the Second Coming (literally)." Combine this with the realization that he's the heir of the throne and he's all in.
Â 
The fact people are like, "Stannis shouldn't be burning people for being heretics" I think ignores the fact that Stannis isn't a guy who deals in half-measures. A major part of his characterization is that Stannis has adopted this religion and he's going to serve it because he's adopted the religion. There's not going to be any tolerance in the Seven Kingdoms for the Seven or the Old Gods because he's the King and as the King he's vowed to serve the Lord of Light.
Â 
Again, all in.
Â 
The idea Stannis is a Taliban figure is kind of a serious reach since George R.R. Martin is drawing from the fact religious conflicts are a major issue in dynastic struggles, especially during the Renaissance. While Henry VIII was way past the War of the Roses, we can see shades of this in the conflict. Stannis is not a secular figure uncaring about religion. He's a secular figure who uses religion as the justification for his rule. Religion is VERY important as a means of propping up himself as well as himself.
Â 
If you don't think his reign would result in thousands upon thousands of burnings, you're kind of missing some subtext.

I think I understand why you don't get the complaints. It's because you have no idea what you are talking about. First of all, stannis claim is not being justified on religion, it's not areligious claim his claim is based on law and justified by LAW. He is Roberts brother, Robert has no kids, by all the laws of the realm that means stannis is king. Second, book stannis is an atheist, he says as much to davos. And lastly, the amount of people stannis has burned is negligible and none of them were burned for religious reasons. Ales ter was a traitor, mance is self explanatory, and the three peas burry men were cannibals.

Â 
You can say whatever you like but the fact is that in the first conversation between Davos and Stannis, we have the latter talk about how the Seven have done nothing for him so why not do it with the Lord of Light. He is not very religious in terms of passion but he's thrown his support behind the religion. All-in.
Â 
Next, no, he's not deriving his claim to the kingship from the Lord of Light's faith but he IS AA reborn (at least according to Mel). This means he's going about whatever he has to do to "prove" his faith because that's important to him. Stannis is the messiah and this is something which makes him happy (or content since Stannis is never happy).
Â 
Stannis may or may not believe in the Lord of Light but he'd kill half the kingdom if half the kingdom refused to convert to the LoL because he ordered it.
Â 
Why? Because he ordered it and he's the King.
Â 
It's why Renly and everyone else thinks Ned Stark's attempts to put Stannis on the throne is insane and not just a bad idea.
Â 
Insane.

3470	Charles Phipps	2014-04-15	Honestly, I'm also a little surprised at how vehement people are reacting to this. Stannis is killing people for a reason people have killed people since Ur and Babylon. There's a reason behind his actions and it's a helluv of a lot more sensible than Ramsey or Joffrey's serial killings.
Â 
Will Stannis kill much more than those two?
Yes.
However, that's sort of the point isn't it? GRR deconstructs a lot of Medieval tropes in his books and "holy war" is one of them.

Ah K.

Why is he still alive?
3475	Charles Phipps	2014-04-15	I don't see Stannis as a fool but an example of Values Dissonance in action. Mel and Stannis are probably both very nice people under the surface, unlike Cersei and Joffrey, but their "good" sides are disrupted by their beliefs. Mel is killing people horrifically because she REALLY BELIEVES it's for their own good. Stannis is doing all manner of horrible things because he believes being King is right.
Â 
He wants to be King but it's not really something he'll be happy doing either.
Â 
Values that ancient people held but aren't so common anymore.

Â 
Well, Show Davos is a stated and public atheist. Not that it matters.
Â 
Davos is alive because Stannis wants someone to give him sound practical advice that he can understand. He's also politically untenable without Stannis' support. Stannis would kill Davos if he ever asked him to convert and he refused but deliberately doesn't ask him.
Â 
Stannis needs a "no" man even if he's all in.

3478	Denam_Pavel	2014-04-15	I see no significant difference between the show Stannis and the book Stannis. I think the show gives the essence of Stannis very well. He is a fool under Mel's spell.


Â 
1.Â Book Stannis wouldn't execute people merely for not converting. In fact, when listing the best nominations for Hand aside from Davos, he mentions several of the people Davos later recruits who reject the R'hllor.
2.Â Stannis wouldn't execute Edric Storm just like that. He needed to see Balon, Joffrey and Robb die first. He's in denial about what happened to Renly.
3.Â When Davos shows him the letter of the Night's Watch telling them about their troubles, they leave for the Night's Watch. As Jaime said in the premiere it's been WEEKS since then and Show Stannis has shown no signs of getting ready to go anywhere.
4.Â Even when they burned Alester for clear treason, which this replaces, it served a practical function, to boost the wind in their sails. Show Axell purely died for the sheer entertainment value.
Â 
Number 3 is the big one. The moment in which his onion knight reminds of his duty has passed already. Even Melisandre and Davos combined failed to inspire in him any interest in the Night's Watch's plight.
3479	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-04-15	After re-watching it, I think I have changed my mind. I like what they are doing with Stannis or maybe moreso I should say I like what Stephen Dillane is doing with Stannis. Â The first time around I was paying attention to the people talking and he didn't talk much, but if you focus on him when Mel and Selyse are talking you get so much from his face about how he feels about the whole thing. Â I'm really looking forward to seeing him up North, I think that is when it will really get good. Â It's taken me awhile, but I'm now really sold on Stephen Dillane's Stannis.
3480	aFeastForDragons	2014-04-15	I'm amazed at how people come on to this forum to take part in an intelligent debate but are to blind to see how Stannis is clearly being portrayed badly. I guess everyone likes arguing when they are on the internet and the trolls in this post are no exception. If you don't see it you really shouldn't be posting about it.

Â 
I think it's to illustrate how religious very serious business in this setting and not something that exists as a "live and let live" subject in this country. You serve the faith of your monarch or you are committing a crime with very few exceptions.
This is how it was for the majority of history in fact.
Â 
Stannis made a choice to convert and what's a personal choice in our world is a very impersonal choice for all of his subjects.
Â 
Also, I've got to bring up something--what does it matter why he's killing these people? He's choosing horrific religiously-charged reasons for them to die anyway. If he kills a man for treason and burns him alive, he's just hedging his bets.

3482	The Drunkard	2014-04-15	Davos is a hardcore Seven follower.Â

Â 
Well, last season Melisandre told Stannis that he would need Davos, and that's the only reason Davos wasn't executed. I imagine that's still in effect.
Â 
Â 


No, Stannis tells Davos that he had Sunglass burned, and I presume the Rambtons too ("... and the new Sunglass sailed for Volantis after I burned his brother.") The impression I'd take from it is that he confirmed that it should be done before parting ways with her. Doubtless it was at her suggestion, but he was aware and approved.


Â 
What would his reasoning be? Melisandre was sent away because he didn't want the victory being attributed to her, and having her publicly sacrifice people near or during the battle seems completely counter-productive.
Â 
My impression was that Stannis was owning what Selyse did, like during the prologue with the fool's hat.
Â 


3.Â When Davos shows him the letter of the Night's Watch telling them about their troubles, they leave for the Night's Watch. As Jaime said in the premiere it's been WEEKS since then and Show Stannis has shown no signs of getting ready to go anywhere.


Â 
I wonder if they don't have enough ships. Saan already left him and if I remember correctly book-Stannis admits he has no fleet but Saan's pirate one (although that's a detail they could easily fudge). Maybe it'll be explained next episode, given Stannis talks about how he's running out of time, but otherwise that's weird.
Â 
World's going to hell, awkward dinners take priority.Â
3483	Nyrhex	2014-04-15	No, Stannis tells Davos that he had Sunglass burned, and I presume the Rambtons too ("... and the new Sunglass sailed for Volantis after I burned his brother.")

Â 
I don't get why people take it as burning for not changing religions? The bulk of Stannis' army still follows the seven, as well as the men he trusts the most. Where is the logic in burning a fewÂ "infidels", while letting the majority of your host live as infidels?Â 
Â 
Sunglass came to Stannis and told him that because Stannis changed gods, Sunglass can no longer serve him. Sunglass burned for treason as well. Ironborn follow the Drowned God, Northmen follow the Old Gods, Thoros followed the Lord of Light. All served under Robert, and the only one to deny Robert was Balon. He was seen as a traitor and a rebel and was crushed by all of Westeros. Having your own god does not mean that you cannot follow a king/lord with a different god. Most of Stannis' army is King's Men. They still follow the Seven and yet they follow Stannis. Manderly follows the Seven yet serves the Starks who follow the Old Gods. The Rambtons killed some Stannis' men as Stannis was burning his own private property. They died for treason as well, every one.Â 
Â 
The religious intoleranceÂ is strong with all religions in the books. Suggs makes fun of gods that let themselves be pissed at by dogs. Look at Aeron for the Drowned Men's view of other religions. Greatjon with his "even thier gods are wrong" and the Night's Watch Septon pitching in with how Jon did not take his vows in the sept but in front of the Wilding's trees as if his oath is less sincere, Penrose treatment of Mel during the Parley...
Â 
Execution by fire is not limited to followers of the LoL, nor is it the worse type of execution/punishment we see in the books. We see crow cages in areas that follow the seven,Â crucifixion in Slaver's Bay, Old Gods followers offering humanÂ sacrifices, and decorating the trees with the entrails of thier enemies, Boltons and skin flaying/wearing, force feeding human flesh and sometimes your own body parts, ice cells, impalement on stakes... Torture is done all over the place and burning people to death is apparently a thing that is the easiest to do when you have dragons/wildfire. Throwing people to thier deaths from trebuchets is also a thing now, and I'm not sure if Joffrey thought of it because he is Jaime's son, or if Jaime took inspiration from his son.
Â 
For some reason Stannis choosing fire for some of his executions makes him stand out in all this? How? It's clearly not killing people because of thier religion, it's clearly not the worst punishment/execution method, so why is it a thing to emphasise in the show? Why do D&D refer to Mel's power as "dark magic"? Is Thoros not doing "dark magic"? Is Dany not using it? Is Bran not using it? Why is it that the same tool is seen as good at the hands of others, but as bad when used by Stannis?Â

Yeah, they really do not get some of his subtleties, I was watching inside the episode and they were saying that he wants to be King because he sees at his birthright, which is nonsense. When he was born he was Roberts heir to Storms End, he wasn't born into the royal line. Supporting Robert over his King was a very difficult decision and he choose Robert out of love, becuse he was family, that and he seemed convinced that Aerys was insane, its not clear what he thought of Rhaegar. He then serves his brother loyally for years, despite there being problems between them, which have not been shown in the TV show as of yet, Robert giving Storms End to Renly Â as one example. Then he finds out that Cerseis kids are not Roberts, he can not go to Robert himself because of their estrangement, Jon Arryn is killed and he is forced to flee the capital. With Roberts death it becomes his duty to take the throne, there is no reason to think he would do this if Cerseis kids were indeed Roberts.Â 
Â 
Having said all that I do think the Stan critics make some fair points, that there is part of Stannis that does thirst for power, now that it is within reach and that it could and is corrupting him. I also think that it is about his duty and honor, he can either take the throne or die, he could flee for Essos but that is not in his character. Cerseis kids are not Roberts true heirs, as long as Renly and Stannis live they are a threats which must be eliminated,
Â 
As far as the religious aspect goes I do not see Stannis as an aetheist at this point, he is a skeptic. Clearly he has rejected the seven but he has had true religious experiences with the Lord of Light. He has seen two visions in the fire that we know of, one of the attack on the Fist of the First Men and the one with a king being consumed by a crown of fire. These visions do guide his actions to an extent. Asha tells us that she constantly see him staring into the flames. I sort of see him as actually trying to become pious and religiously observant, clearly its the power he perceives in it that drew him to it in the first place but he is falling away from his atheism.
Â 


This is actually kind of proof positive Stannis would do it, isn't it?
After all, if he ordered everyone to convert, it's treason not to.


What he did was burn a Sept and later the Godswood on Storms End, so he himself has publicly refuted the Old Gods and the New ones. I think many hold to the Gods of the their Fathers in private but being seen as publicly going against this new God that Stannis follows would be seen as disloyalty, ecspecially from men who serve him directly. There is no open worship of other Gods within his own camp only the Red God.

I think if Stannis did become King, he would advocate for his religion and maybe show some favor to people who also espoused it. Still I do not think that worshipping the Red God really blinds Stannis to a mans faults. I do not think he will ever get the throne or be able to hold it if he adopts this very rigid philosophy and I think he knows this.Â 
Â 
Its funny, if Stannis became King, I do think people would convert to gain his favor, at the same everything I see of him makes me think that he Â despises people like this. Its hard to predict how the other faiths would fare if Stannis actually does become the King.Â

3489	Charles Phipps	2014-04-15	Stannis knows the good a person does, doesn't cancel the bad. The reverse is true, however. Davos is unconverted to the Lord of Light but has made numerous personal shows of loyalty to Stannis. The people who have refused to convert have obviously made far less in the way of pledges to him as far as Stannis is concerned. As for his daughter, Stannis knows she's a child and there's plenty of time to bring her around.
Â 

Â

Yeah, he can't tolerate public displays of disobedience like refusing to take down his "idols."

Â 
That's the contradiction of Stannis, I think. He's an "honest" man but the halls of power in Westeros are born from corruption. He's like Ned Stark in that he follows his code but he doesn't even have Ned Stark's flexibility. If Stannis were King, he'd be the guy who punished people without regard to position or peace or favoritism because that's the law.
Â 
He's Judge Dredd converted to Zorastrianism.
Â 
So yeah, even he would know converting everyone by force would be a disaster but, yeah, that's what he's going to do because that's what his new religion demands.

Stannis isn't a hypocrite for sparing Davos. He's made his decision based on the fact Davos is an exception for exceptional behavior. His daughter is also a child, not an adult.
Â 
As for converting people now, Stannis is not unaware ofÂ politicalÂ expediency. He accepted the Onions from the Onion knight.

He just cut off his knucklebones after.

3491	Ran	2014-04-15	Nyrhex,Both in the books and on the show, Stannis burns people for disobeying him.His initial dismissive answer to Davos that they were "infidels" is followed by the much more significant point that he didn't command them to change religion, he commanded them to remove their idols of the Seven, and they refused him. This is pretty much what happens when he burns the Rambtons for refusing to allow his command to burn the idols of the Seven in the sept at Dragonstone to be carried out -- they're allowed to worship what gods they please, but they can't stand in the way of Stannis's orders.It's not terribly unlike religious laws in medieval Europe regulating worship by Jews/Christians/Muslims (depends on who was in charge wherever you were) so as to prevent offense to the dominant religion and keep the minority religions present (and their worshippers taxable).

Â 
The difference is that in the show Stannis burns the "infidel", who refused to perform Stannis' order and tear down "his"Â idols, meaning to convert himself and destroy his own sept. In the books the Rambtons kill Stannis' men as they are performing thier orders to destroy Stannis' sept. The Sept at Dragonstone is Stannis' private property, it is not the Rambtons' sept. The show has Stannis kill men who refused Stannis'Â forced conversion, while in the books Stannis does not try to force convert them. More than half his army still follows the Seven. His Hand, his castellan, all the men he names to Davos as those he can trust. In the show we have non of that.
Â 
So, no, it is not the same. To disobey Stannis' orders, and to kill his men as Stannis is converting in person and destroying his own property are two different things. To burn Alester for refusing to follow the red god and to burn him for treason and trying to sell Shireen to the Lannisters are two very different things on a fundamentalÂ level. The show sets the tone for Stannis being a very darker shade of grey than the books, to the point that it can almost be called black. What does it serve to burn this person for not converting, if you let Davos live? Had Davos converted in the show and I did'nt noticed?Â

3493	roxWolfox	2014-04-15	After I rewatched the scene in question, I guess the burning was the less important things to be noticed, really. It's the catalyst, yes, but the next scene is the important one and it's not there just for us to see the Baratheons enjoying a very awkward meal. The whole scene is about Stannis and Shireen. Look.
Â 
- Stannis is clearly disgusted by everything around him, including Davos. Shireen is not there, though. He probably doesn't want her around the whole mess that it's his life. Shireen's absence means to me that for Stannis, the world now is divided in two things: everything he hates and Shireen. And Shireen doesn't mix with the things he hates.
Â 
- Selyse also disgusts him. He didn't say it with words, but he's pretty much implying that she might be his wife but that's all. She even tries to recall what she might perceive as a caring act of Stannis, but he barely reacts to the memory: "of course I remember", like "well, duh, I was there".
Â 
- She changes the conversation to the lord of light and Stannis is all "meh". He pays attention when Selyse baits him with something she knows he cares: Shireen, and then she calls her a "stubborn little beast". That doesn't sound like something she would say simply because Shireen refuses to "convert". To me, it looks like she actually dislikes the girl, maybe because of the greyscale, maybe because she's a girl. Or maybe...
Â 
- Selyse states that Stannis thinks Shireen's sweet because she smiles at him. While in the previous dialogue is clear that Stannis barely pays attention to his wife besides his marital duties of feeding her and keeping her safe, Shireen doesn't need to do anything but to smile to have Stannis' attention and love, something Selyse doesn't have.
Â 
- Selyse also calls Shireen "sullen, subborn and sinful". She's pretty much describing Stannis right there. It's Selyse the one who doesn't know Stannis.
Â 
The whole scene is quite symbolic because of the dialogue and the food scenery: Selyse is starving from Stannis' favour and she's unable to provide him with anything he likes ("the meat's off, get something else"). She even got him a women who promises him being King and he's still unhappy. Stannis complains about the food while Selyse simply eats it in silence and tries to do her best with the few she has: that's their marriage. And when Melisandre speaks of suffering hunger as a child until the Lord of Light found her, that's Selyse right there, being hungry of something else (love) until Melisandre found her.


Fascinating insight.Â  
My favourite part of the dinner scene was Mel absorbing Stannis' and Selyse's 'discussion'.Â  Which made the Shireen/Mel conversation all that more powerful.Â  Shireen's dialogue not only shows that she is more her father's daughter than mother's, it also may have been a hint to the viewers that Stannis is not so easily 'converted' as Mel or Selyse would like to believe.

Given G.R.R Martin wrote this episode, it's more likely this is simply an aspect of his character which hasn't come up much. That the Red God will reign once Stannis is King of the Seven.

Â 
The scene was not written by GRRM, it was written for episode 1, and was moved to episode 2. You are grasping at straws here.
3496	Colonel Green	2014-04-15	Given G.R.R Martin wrote this episode


No, Martin didn't write the Stannis scenes.Â  And in any event, the showrunners are the ones who plot the show, not Martin.
3497	johndance	2014-04-15	I love how this thread title is 'A balanced review of show Stannis'. Clearly, there is nothing balanced about the review of him here. It should be titled 'A place for those of us who disagree with the portrayal of show Stannis can vent and complain'.Â  I'm totally fine with that, too. There are a lot of people for some reason who think his character is being 'butchered' on the show so have at it.Â 
Â 
I really don't see what all the fuss is about. The way he is being portrayed in the show is pretty much spot on to how I pictured him while reading the books. He is a cold, serious, battle hardened man. He does his duty and expects others to do theirs, while serving justice to those who do not.
Â 
He has seen Mel do some things he cannot explain, i.e. birth a shadow child who killed Renly, and show him visions of his future victories when he stares into the fire. He really has no choice but to believe what Mel is preaching and take on the lord of light. He's seen the power of this religion and has to believe in it. He clearly doesn't like it. He doesn't like burning people or forsaking his 'old' gods, but Stannis is the type of man that if you tell him something and have proof to back it up, he will put practicality ahead of his emotions and believe it. This is exactly what I get out of show Stannis as well. They have made it very clear on several occasions in the show that Stannis is morally against many of the things Mel wants to do. However, he's seen proof that backs up Mel's claims so he is going a long with it.
Â 
I don't get the claims that he is being portrayed as a villain or a bad guy or anything of that non sense. The biggest villains from a portrayal standpoint were the Lannisters. ESPECIALLY Cersei and Joffrey. These two were clearly made out to be the biggest villains of the show, and Stannis Â actually went to war AGAINST them and is still planning on taking over the IT.
Â 
And let's not forget, one of the biggest heroes or 'good guys' Ned Stark, actually supported Stannis and is the one that wrote a letter to him letting him know he is the rightful King in the first place. This is why it amazes me that so many people think he is being 'butchered' in the show. I really think they are spot on with him and D&D are actually doing more favors for him and making him more of a protagonist than he is in the books.Â

3498	aceluby	2014-04-15	What I find humorous is that during the battle of the blackwater there couldn't be more gush about how Stan should have lead from the front and the show was 'more right', but anything that could possibly be construed as a negative, despite the fact that he is a very flawed character, all of a sudden it's a character assassination.Â  Classic whitewashing.
3499	Konradsmith	2014-04-15	Â We don't know that D and D wrote the Stannis scenes. If someone wants to go comment on Notablog or Bryan Cogman's twitter, we could potentially find out. For all we know Carice received the first script as a formality. It is also possible that they did write the scene and it was shifted but until we know we shouldn't go into this level of freak-out over just this. You have to prep yourselves for the possibility that GrrM had Stannis say "infidel". Also, it is likely that Bryan Cogman mapped out Stannis's arc again, as he did last year. You have to prepare yourselves to accept that it may have been Bryan's idea for Stannis to go "full Melisandre."
Â 
I suppose it was only a matter of time before Stan the Man joined this "balanced thread". Did he read any of my defences of the scene as written? Or anyone else's?Â Most importantly, Ran's posts becauseÂ heÂ may actually knowÂ Stannis's fate because of certain TWOW chapters that would have been in ADWD. Did he not hear the brilliant Stan quips: "A good deal more than you." "I hate good many things but I suffer them all the same." "Of course I remember." It was a good scene goddamnit!
Â 
Once more, D and D are not insulting Stannis in thatÂ inside theÂ episode videoÂ and they do not "hate him", that would do themÂ no good. As a character with dramatic potential, they probably like him quite a lot. Let's not be silly, unless we want to call this thread something else other thanÂ "balanced".

3500	aeu	2014-04-15	I'm amazed at how people come on to this forum to take part in an intelligent debate but are to blind to see how Stannis is clearly being portrayed badly. I guess everyone likes arguing when they are on the internet and the trolls in this post are no exception. If you don't see it you really shouldn't be posting about it.


Â 
Lol...I chuckled at this.
Â 
I wonder how much ad-libbing the actors are allowed to do. Â I assume they would be asked to stick to script word by word, but it would have been so funny if the actor actually blurted "infidel" on his own...
3501	Ran	2014-04-15	The difference is that in the show Stannis burns the "infidel", who refused to perform Stannis' order and tear down "his"Â idols, meaning to convert himself and destroy his own sept.I'm not sure that this means he intended him to convert. It means he's outlawed public worship, I suppose, but I would not construe it as meaning he's forcibly converting people until someone in the production, or a future episode, confirms this.
3502	Bronn Urgundy	2014-04-15	"Fuck me, looks like we're getting Ostannis Bin Laden after all" was my first reaction after hearing him say infidel. If I look at it more balanced, then yes, it looks like a much more pitiful version of what happened to Sunglass, but since Sunglass was sympathetic enough anyway, and Stannis was apparently burning peeps in Season 3 according to Saan, it just looks a million times worse coming now especially, this should have happened as it does in the books. Sunglass withdrew his support, which is exactly what Robb threatened to hang the Greatjon for, and the Rambtons physically fought against Stannis, its the same situation, but making Stannis' reasons as pitiful as possible and dropping the line in after a bombshell like "infidel". Trying to confuse "too just for his own good" (book Stannis) with "religious nutjob/Mels slobbering lapdog" (show Stannis). It should have come last season, and Alistair should've been executed for treason.
Â 
These are controversial enough decisions anyway, especially as Florent is a freaking blood sacrifice who actually might have been trying to end a lost war and saving lives, but these people died for the sake of law, not for their Gods, but no, they really had to try to kick his legs out from under him before we've even began this season.

Â 
As for converting people now, Stannis is not unaware ofÂ politicalÂ expediency. He accepted the Onions from the Onion knight.
He just cut off his knucklebones after.


Â 
Doesn't prove much except for that age old claim that he's too just for his own good, we all know what Davos got for the onions, it was a Knighthood, but if he wanted to accept the Knighthood he must pay for his years of illegal smuggling. We must assume that sneaking food to a starving garrison in wartime is as legal an act as gutting an enemy during battle.
Â 
I can see your scenario coming about if Stannis is wilfully negligent with Melisandre's activities post wartime, but I can't recall one instance of him requiring conversion. I know Mel tells Jon to uproot the trees at WF, but Stannis is noticeably silent on that one, the Wildlings burn tree branches, but so what? Theres never any noticeable conversion, and Stannis' only demand to any future Wall crossers is that they kneel to him and keep the Kings peace.
Â 
Just right now I think its a huge stretch to say Stannis is going to be burning non-converts on a large scale, he might try to make R'hlorr the dominant religion, or at least be annointed under that particular faith and make it dominant in the capital, he'll probably end up with physical resistance (depending on how exhausted everyone is post wartime) these are things that are problematic, but Stannis up to this point has never made it a crime to follow another God(s), and there really is no reason for him to do a 180 on this stance unless the Seven followers react excessively violently to the change. But looking at the make-up of Stannis' followers pre and post Wall march, and that they know who he is and what to expect, it doesn't seem too likely. If anything it just seems like Stannis' whole arc seems to be kind of sacrificed to make way for an anti-monarchy/religious agenda, since D&D themselves seem baffled that the rightful King believes he's the rightful King.
3503	Konradsmith	2014-04-15	I'm glad you've stepped in, Ran. I don't always agree with you about the show (I defend it a heckuva lot more), butÂ really that makes your arguments about their Stannis characterization more convincing than mine.
Â 
It is interesting to note that they've kindof merged Selyse with the actual Axell in a way. Didn't some at the Wall consider him a kinslayer for standing by while another Florent was burned?

3. If by burning him the man's soul is "cleansed" and he joins R'hllor (as Selyse is happy to tell Davos), than it is not execution over disobeying, it's forced conversion dead or alive.
3505	Konradsmith	2014-04-15	Well, they've certainly made changes but the point is that they don't "ruin" the character. He is still compellingly written and acted. They've made him go to lengths he never quite went to, but if it makes for good TV and works with the plot mechanics of his s4 arc then I don't mind.

					
					
							Edited by Konradsmith, 15 April 2014 - 02:44 PM.
3506	Lord Varys	2014-04-15	I've no issues with the portrayal of Stannis in that episode. He most certainly allows people close to him (i.e. Mel and Selyse) to burn people for crimes he would not have punished this way before his conversion to R'hllor, and he must also be aware of the fact that these people would not have given him cause to execute them had he openly converted to R'hllorism and allowed Melisandre to create her theocracy under/beside his own administration.
Â 
This is bad, especially if (book) Stannis has only chosen 'a red falcon' and does not exactly believe in god. If Mel is just a powerful sorceress in his eyes, then going along with her demands and wishes is actually worse than it would be if he actually believed that her god was real. In the books Stannis eventually accepts that he is as Azor Ahai and/or that he is supposed to fight the war against the Others, but we don't really know if he really believes in Mel's god.
Â 
Show Stannis seems to be converted in the sense that he takes Mel's power and his vision as a sign that Mel speaks the truth and that her god is real.Â 
Â 
But one can make a case that this thing should have happened in season 3, directly after the Blackwater, not now. It would have been a much more introduction of Shireen and Selyse if the Florents had tried to sell Shireen to the Lannisters as Tommen's bride, while Stannis was brooding in isolation.
Â 
The relationship between Stannis and Selyse seems to be much better in the show than in the books: Stannis is now disgusted by Selyse, but that was not always so. I guess he could not get along with the woman she became, after she dealt with her grief the way she did. He really seemed disgusted by the dead children in the jars, and I guess he was also not exactly turned out by her flight into religion.
Â 
His talk with Davos in season 2 as well as Selyse's memory this week strongly suggests that he once cared for her (deeply). They repeatedly tried to have children, and Stannis did everything he could to save Selyse during the siege of Storm's End. That's much more than book Stannis ever did for his wife. And TV Stannis apparently really loves his daughter. We don't know if book Stannis really cares all that much for Shireen. He does nothing to groom her for the succession.
Â 
It would be interesting if the family story on Dragonstone ended with Stannis publicly announcing that Shireen is his heir. The show has made it clear that women come way behind men in the succession to the Iron Throne, so that could be an interesting development, especially since Selyse hates her daughter in the show. It seems that she considers her a rival for Stannis' affection...

Eh, it's not forced conversion...it's more Show!Stannis has implemented a "don't ask don't tell" rule for non-R'hllor worshippers. It is certainly a worse portrayal than in the books.
3508	Ran	2014-04-15	I don't think it matters if Stannis outlaws something in the show and not the books. The idea is that they wanted to find some way to show that he's inflexible when it comes to his commands, a reminder that he's still very much an absolutist authoritarian despite bending enough to keep Davos around. They also want to emphasize the position he's in: defeated, few men left to him, trying to hold on to his base of power by hook or by crook.The interpretations of Selyse and Melisandre of Stannis's actions don't interest me. We've a scene immediately following the burning where Stannis's remark sure seems to reflect back on what just happened: he looks like he hates doing it, he says he hates lots of things, but he tolerates them (because he sees them as necessary, or he sees as he has no choice; though really, I think for Stannis the two are more or less the same concept), so I think you've got to frame the burning scene in the context of that.He hates it, but he tolerates it for a reason. What reason? My guess is that it's an attempt to reassert his authority and stamp out dissent. I don't think the Stannis of the show is a R'hllorian zealot. But while there's King's Men who worship the Seven still, I've a feeling that in the books it's a lot of private worship; I doubt the sept gets much usage anymore, if any, because no one wants to risk offending the king.Perhaps I'm being too generous to the writers and assuming they're trying to walk a fine line with Stannis. Which they should be, and which George does. He's the Rorschach of Westeros.

Didn't Lord Sungrass get burned alive for not tearing down his Sept?Â  I don't think Stannis was there for that, but he didn't punish Selyse or Melisandre for it either.

Selyse talked about Shireen being sinful and even considered to beat her. Ever met parents who are religions nutjobs? Because Selyse is one of them. Stannis, otoh, is not. He doesn't approve her beating Shireen. He doesn't say it but he seems to imply that Shireen is a limit she doesn't want her to cross: everything else, he tolerates. Otherwise, why wouldn't they bring the girl into the fire ceremony?

Lors Sunglass forswore his allegiance with Stannis after they burned the sept at Dragonstone. Stannis imprisoned him, and while he was away Selyse burned him.
3513	Ran	2014-04-15	Sunglass refused to serve Stannis or raise his banners for him, because Stannis followed R'hllor. Stannis saw this as treason -- a vassal can't just go ahead and do that -- and Stannis had him burned. It seems Melisandre does this at his behest.But the argument here is whether Stannis burned the men for refusing to convert, or because they refused to remove evidence of their holding to the Seven when Stannis wants to remove any significant public signs of dissent against his rule, in a "don't ask, don't tell" kind of way (as Chebyshov put it).

Â 
Â 
It's still a big difference from the book though, where he burns them for treason, e.g. not calling the banners. Being executed because you say "I won't submit to you as my liege lord" is still quite a different thing from "I won't tear down the holy relics of my faith".
Â 
All things being equal, it wouldn't be that huge of a thing, and maybe it isn't, but they've already had Stannis following Mel and making a fool of himself in front of his own men and completely changing his mind and plans within the span of 5 seconds because Mel told him to. Â So, when you add in pure religious extremism, it gets harder and harder to say he isn't being changed for the worse by the show.

Â 
1. I think it matters. It shows him in a darker light. It's not him converting in person, he forces others to convert, or at least offends thier rights as well. To show watchers, Stannis is being showen as more of a bad guy, a thrall of Mel, doing all she wants. In the books it takes three kings (not just one) dying for him to accept that maybe the power she claims to have is real, and he can end this war for the throne in order to fight for the Dawn. Even then he threatens her that if it does'nt work she would die by inches for making him kill an innocent for something short ofÂ saving all life on the planet.Â Nope, here it's just Stannis burning people who refuse to tear down thier own idols.Â 
2. Showing Stannis trying to re-assert authority by burning loyal men,Â afterÂ they brought him men and ships, is daft. They already follow him, why limit thier religious freedom? Thier ships burnt and thier men died for him. What is he going to get out of this?Â LessÂ men than he currently has? Saan is all the fleet he has, and he works directly for Stannis, not for any of Stannis' lords. The Men Stannis has are what he has, no more would pop up.
3. How is "don't ask, don't tell" going to work, if Stannis and all of his men know that one of his two closest advisors isÂ notÂ converting? Davos tries to kill Mel openly, spends time in the dungen, and is set free by Stannis. Still unconverted.Â 
Â 
It's does'nt make any sense. Stannis has no reason to burn his own lords for not tearing down thier own "idols". He should already be halfway to the Wall by now. Not only does he waste his time on Dragonstone with burning people whoÂ already follow him, he already knows about the Others too. Book Stannis gets a letter warning about the danger to the Wall from the Wildling host that is marching south. Show Stannis knows what Sam knows - The Others are coming close behind. Now he just seems to be wasting time with bullshit while he should be on his way north.
Â 
Is the burning to get better winds? Nope. It's because the guy refused to convert/tear down his false idols. Two options: Either we don't get that part, or Stannis adds more burnings, and one is still over someone's religion. At this rate I'm starting to wonder if the Thenns are cannibals now because in the books they serve Stannis.Â 
Â 


Â 
Didn't Lord Sungrass get burned alive for not tearing down his Sept?Â  I don't think Stannis was there for that, but he didn't punish Selyse or Melisandre for it either.


Â 
No, Stannis arrests lord Sunglass for being an oathbreaker. The Greatjon threatened to return to his hold with all his men if Robb Stark won't give him the Vanguard. Robb told him that if he goes he would hang as an oathbreaker. Sunglass, like Manderly, faced a situation where his liege lord has other gods than the Seven. Unlike Manderly, he tells Stannis that he will not serve him any longer for that. That is oathbreaking.Â
3516	Thelastactionhero	2014-04-15	I don't think it matters if Stannis outlaws something in the show and not the books. The idea is that they wanted to find some way to show that he's inflexible when it comes to his commands, a reminder that he's still very much an absolutist authoritarian despite bending enough to keep Davos around. They also want to emphasize the position he's in: defeated, few men left to him, trying to hold on to his base of power by hook or by crook.
The interpretations of Selyse and Melisandre of Stannis's actions don't interest me. We've a scene immediately following the burning where Stannis's remark sure seems to reflect back on what just happened: he looks like he hates doing it, he says he hates lots of things, but he tolerates them (because he sees them as necessary, or he sees as he has no choice; though really, I think for Stannis the two are more or less the same concept), so I think you've got to frame the burning scene in the context of that.
He hates it, but he tolerates it for a reason. What reason? My guess is that it's an attempt to reassert his authority and stamp out dissent. I don't think the Stannis of the show is a R'hllorian zealot. But while there's King's Men who worship the Seven still, I've a feeling that in the books it's a lot of private worship; I doubt the sept gets much usage anymore, if any, because no one wants to risk offending the king.
Perhaps I'm being too generous to the writers and assuming they're trying to walk a fine line with Stannis. Which they should be, and which George does. He's the Rorschach of Westeros.


Sorry, was there a power vacuum on Dragon Stone that opened up while I wasn't looking? There's no indication, either in the show or the books, that Stannis is at risk for losing his last stronghold to dissent from within. This is really the big problem that I think people like you are overlooking, because context does mean a great deal when it comes to these burnings. Doesn't make burning people alive acceptable by any means, but his reasons for executing in this fashion still matter. Stannis is a pragmatist, and he commits his share of brutal acts throughout the series, though more often than not they serve what he sees as the greater good. There's absolutely nothing practical about him burning Axel Florent in this scene. He's not even doing it to ensure properous winds to reach the Wall in time. This change in context serves no other purpose than to tinge him an even darker shade of gray, one that is all but devoid of all the aspects that made so many of us fall in love with his book counterpart. The infidel line reaks of fanaticism, despite these weak defenses of him using the term. Stannis is a grim man, and a flawed one as well, but I see absolutely no indication that he's headed north because he realizes its his duty as a king, as is made clear in the books and by the author himself. In the show I see only a weak willed man lacking any autonomy following the whims of his red priestess in pursuit of power. Another thing to consider, which shoots down this theory that this stupid infidel plotline somehow works in showing how practical he is, is that Stannis never forces any of the Northmen that join his cause in aDwD to convert. He doesn't make this a neccessary condition for joining his army because he's smart enough to know how fucking stupid and impractical such a move would be.
Â 
But really, what it comes down to is that Stannis doesn't burn innocent people. He burns criminals, and the traitor who wanted to sell his daughter to the Lannisters. Stannis is a hard, brutal, morally gray, but righteous man, and for him to kill innocents in such an arbitrary fashion conflicts not only with his moral disposition in the books, but also with how he was portrayed in Season 3. Though he doesn't agonize over sacrificing Gendry the way he agonizes over sacrificing Edric, we spend three episodes where Stannis contemplates whether or not the sacrifice of an innocent life is worth the utilitarian ends he hopes to achieve. While Stannis ulitimately makes the wrong choice in the show, it feels completely out of character for him to suddenly make this ideological and moral shift, especially since the sacrifice serves no visible practical gain outside of, as you suggested, putting down some non-existant internal rebellion. It's a silly, unneccessary aesthetic change that does nothing but cheapen the character and his arc. I'm not one of the Stannis fans who looks at him through rose tinted glasses, but I find it absolutely astounding that our objections to the changes are dismissed with such weak justifications.
3517	The Red Melli	2014-04-15	I didn't like that Stannis said the word "infidel".
But I'm not giving my hopes up there's clearly a difference between Stannis and Selyse regarding the Lord of light facial expression said it all this episode.
Â 
Â 
All in all, I liked the Dragonstone scenes. They were very well acted and I'm hoping to see more.

Â 
This. They had no reason to change why Florent was burned. Treason is met by death all over Westeros, but burning people for being ''infidels'' is fanatism no matter how grumpy you are about it. And Stannis is many things, not all of them good by any means, but he's not a fanatic. I see no other reasoning for this than to (yet again) paint him as a weak pawn of Melissandre. All the Unsullied I know think he's at best a very dark grey in the vein of the Lannisters, and at worst a villain. They removed much of his moral ambiguity in favor of making him a weak, power-hungry jerk.
Â 
I mean, after the beach scene where's hes horny for her, him giving her Gendry far sooner than Edric in the books and then only going to the Wall and sparing Davos because she tells him to, you'd think the showrunners would have made their point.
3519	A Man Has Said	2014-04-15	Stainnus is claiming to be THE King.
And as was mentioned upthread, his style is very much in the absolutist, no-questions-asked mold.
FFS, he repeatedly says in the books, "Some Would Call It TREASON." (Disobeying him.)
Â 
As such, anything done by his followers is going to be perceived as having been done by his will, if not under his orders.
Anything done in his presence is surely to be seen as having been done with his approval.
It doesn't matter if he ordered it or not.
If he doesn't denounce it on the spot, and punish the person responsible, he has given it his tacit approval.
Â 
"With great power comes great responsibility."
3520	Konradsmith	2014-04-15	The showrunners have said that they don't think Stannis is a fanatic though. And they said that again in the new inside the episode which for some reason has given rise to renwedÂ StanStan complaints.

3521	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-04-15	Ran. Seriously,  At this point of the story Edric is an "infidel" and Stannis struggles half a book about sacrifice him or not to get himself a DRAGON.  Three leehes need to work to make him doubt. And he is just one single boy.
At this point of TV show he burns people just for being infidels and for not any particular magic "benefit". Big difference.
Im lovinf your debate with Nyrhex. Both excellent posters.

Well, from my experience that's not working. As soon as people hear ''infidel'' their thoughts immediately go towards religious fanatism.
3523	Konradsmith	2014-04-15	Mel and Selyse reacted to the burning ecstatically. Stan reacted with a scowl. I think that separates the goats from the sheep more surely than his using the word "infidel" once. After Davos questioned his use of the word he didn't defend it either, he immediately jumped to political justifications.Â Stannis isÂ going through the motions, which is a change in itself, but still, not as monumental a one as you all are making it seem to be. He's not Savonarola.

I'm still catching up on the thread, but my impression is that the OP title IS deceptive.Â 
It's not about a balanced view.
It's not even about Show Stannis being different from Book Stannis.
It's about Show Stannis being different from the "King's Men" view of Stannis,Â 
Which is nowhere close to Book Stannis, IMnsHO.
Â 
They've created this "Stannis the Mannis" Great Hero image, more from reading each other's posts and comments than from reading the character as written by GRRM.
The fact that Show Stannis doesn't follow that mold is simply a function of the fact that D&D aren't members of their club.
Â 
As to the issue of Stannis' fanaticism, that's a simple enough issue to deal with.
Later in ADwD, Stannis does become far more fanatically devoted to R'hllor.
He won't let the Wildlings through the wall into the gift unless they perform a symbolic act of conversion,
burning weirwood branches.
When he burns some men (for cannibalism) during the snowbound trek to Winterfell,
there is a clear implication that he is doing it as a sacrifice, and hoping that R'hllor will change his fortunes.
Â 
So D&D are doing something they've already done many times in the series,
which is to present things in an order differently than they appear in the books.
I think the quote goes something like, "We're doing the show in chronological order, not bookalogical."

He doesnt allow burnings. "half of my army is made of unbelivers" "pray harder". The "Cannibals" he lets burn has more to do with helping the morale of his southern knight than any other magical intention.
He refuses several times to burn Asha. And he is even seamingly likely to behead Theon against a Weirtree insted of burning him.

I'm so tired of hearing that Stephen Dillane's facial expressions are somehow a consolation for how badly he's being portrayed. He's still burning an innocent without a just cause, something that feels completely out of character, even for Show Stannis (we just spent an entire season of him agonizingly contemplating whether or not to sacrifice one innocent life for utilitarian ends, even if it was less compelling than Edric's original storyline). Even you don't like the character, (there are plenty of reasons not to like Stannis) don't you think that giving him compelling reasons for committing these brutal acts makes for a more interesting story arc? Religious fanaticism is a hell of a lot less interesting to me than his cold pragmatism, unyielding resolve, and adherence to duty. Unlike his book counterpart, however, Stannis hasn't made the shift he's supposed to during this arc where he gets his mojo back and remembers what duty truly is. He does questionable things in the series, no doubts there, but come'on, the man has agency, and he's certainly not Mel's lapdog, which is why this is all so disappointing. And yet time and time again we get treated like crazy people for taking issue with D&D's interpretation.

3527	Konradsmith	2014-04-15	Well its not as though his facial expressions are irrelevant either. How he carries himself while he does something is very important and shows the psychology behind what he's up to. If they wanted him to react differently to it, it would have been in the script or the director would have told him otherwise. So, as Will Graham often says in Hannibal, "it is by design" that Stan looks as pissed off/reluctant as he does.

3528	A Man Has Said	2014-04-15	The insistence on his "obsession with his birthright" isn't great either. Stannis is obsessed with a lot more than just taking the throne, why single out this in every second interview?


I don't mean to quibble over such a small point, but the word birthright is just wrong.
Â 
Stannis claims to have inherited the right to the Iron Throne from his brother Robert.
But Robert wasn't king when Stannis wasÂ born, so you can't really call it a birthright.
In fact, when Robert became king, he had no real right to it, though Ned seems to have thought hisÂ claim was better than any of the other participants in Robert's Rebellion; Jon Arryn, Hoster Tully, and Ned himself.
3529	Nyrhex	2014-04-15	Well its not as though his facial expressions are irrelevant either.

So as Will Graham says in Hannibal, "it is by design" that Stan looks as pissed off/reluctant as he does.


Â 
No, they are not irrelevent. They are simply not good enough. When you compare Stannis in the books not being happy and comfortableÂ with converting by himself, and the notion that he has to kill a single innocent boy in order to save all life on the planet agonises him half a book, with show Stannis not being overly fond of burning innocent men becuase they are infidels, it's not bloody close to good enough.
Â 
His facial expressions just don't cut it. Instead of having the person who is literally asked if he would rather one innocent die to save the world, we have an asshole that burns innocents for no fucking reason other than them defying his religious oppression. A religious oppression that serves no pragmatic goal. They already brought him men. Most of them died. Thier ships burnt for him. He has no other sources of income, other than what Saan can bring from "taxing" merchant ships. And Saan does'nt give a rat's ass over Stannis' religion, nor is Stannis trying to convert him to keep him closer. In fact Saan, Stannis' only remaining fleet, is sickened with how Stannis burns innocents. How is Stannis going to keep what little he has with the burnings? They are doing the exact opposite of establishing his rule. Saan can just up and go at any moment.Â 
Â 
Instead of choosing fire as execution when the person is already dead either way, and itÂ may actually help the cause of saving the world, Florent is burning for not converting. As a fan, seeing your favourite character being shown as a bad guy sucks. The attempt to claim that show Stannis is not that different, and actually very close or even spot on with Book Stannis, is salt in the wound. It would be like that for any fan, seeing his favourite portrayed differently by fans of other characters. And D&D are fans. Fans with the rights, and not much holding them from altering the story according to how they see things were, or should have been, in the books. Some characters are white-washed, some are practically screaming "I'M EVIL" at the watchers. In GRRM's books most of the characters are some sort of grey. In the TV show it's D&D's version of who should be darker, and who should be brighter, and how to play with the source material so the ones they want look worse or better.

This is pretty laughable. Would you mind if I poke a few holes in your logic? Firstly, while there are definitely fans of the character who have a super-imposed image that doesn't match up to the text, I am not one of them, and dismissing the arguments of anyone who views the character as a protagonist on the grounds that "Stannis the anti-hero" is simply a big conspiracy devised by a club of internet forum nerds is pretty ludicrous.
Â 
Your argument here seems based around the assumption that Stannis develops into a fanatic later in the series. While this is a poor aesthetic justification for rushing the process in such an uncompelling manner, even if it were true, I have to strongly disagree with your assessment of his arc in aDwD. As I mentioned before, Stannis doesn't try and force the Northerners who join his army to convert to Rhillor. In fact, at this point in the story he actually seems to be quite tolerant of their beliefs, despite his burning of the cannibals, an act which I think functioned as both military execution and religious gesture in equal measure. If you remember from the Winds of Winter sample chapters, Asha actually urges Stannis to execute Theon in the traditional Northern fashion rather than give him to the flames. The fact that he is clearly entertaining this course of action doesn't really seem to indicate a growing sense of fanaticism, as you wrongly suggest. In fact, I think the fall out from that scene is likely to be the deciding moment for Stannis. You're right to say that his relationship with Rhillor is dynamic though, and that he isn't a strictly pragmatic atheist, but he certainly doesn't burn any innocent people simply for being "infidels" in the text. Whatever you think of the character, I don't see why we shouldn't be critical of a storyline that is clearly being cheapened by changing the context of events in such a way that present him in an overwhelming negative light, rather than one that is dark, but morally gray. There are plenty of reasons to hate Stan the Man, so please have at it. Regardless, the reason that we're all so pumped on Martin's work is because he has the ability to develop intriguing figures that are morally ambiguous, and I think something was clearly lost in translation from book to the television screen. I don't expect Stannis the Ubermensh to appear from the sky killing all his foes with a magic sword, but I do expect the cold, unyielding, morally conflicted figure I found so interesting to appear, and he just simply hasn't. And now I doubt he ever will.
Â 
Also, since we're speaking of aDwD, there's a reason why Jon Snow calls Stannis "the king who still cared", and its not something readers should overlook. Jon, while being critical of Stannis, sees the good in him and his cause, even if he is sceptical of the Lord of Light buisness. The reason so many of us find Stannis compelling is because he grudgingly does the right thing when it counts at the Wall, and its something that Jon comes to understand too as they develop this respect for one another. It's a primary reason I feel Stan is being set up as a tragic hero of sorts, rather than as a big bad. Even this arc is a bit tainted now though, because Stannis is headed north solely for religious reasons, since his adherence to duty has been completely thrown to the wind. I mean seriously, even if some fans go overboard deifying him, it's more than clear that Stannis in the show lacks a good deal of autonomy. I really don't see what's so terrible about criticizing an arc that lacks the poignant nuiance of the books, especially when aesthetic changes to narrative, such as what we witnessed on sunday night, feel unneccessary, and do little more than simplify his moral complexity.

The reason so many of us find Stannis compelling is because he grudgingly does the right thing when it counts at the Wall, and its something that Jon comes to understand too as they develop this respect for one another. It's a primary reason I feel Stan is being set up as a tragic hero of sorts, rather than as a big bad. Even this arc is a bit tainted now though, because Stannis is headed north solely for religious reasons, since his adherence to duty has been completely thrown to the wind. I mean seriously, even if some fans go overboard deifying him, it's more than clear that Stannis in the show lacks a good deal of autonomy. I really don't see what's so terrible about criticizing an arc that lacks the poignant nuiance of the books, especially when aesthetic changes to narrative, such as what we witnessed on sunday night, feel unneccessary, and do little more than simplify his moral complexity.


I'm sorry if you feel that my logic is 'laughable,' but I AM in the middle of another re-read, and am perhaps at the point in the books where Stan gets quite a few negative perceptions from various points of view. (about a fifth of the way through ASoS - Davos is still in the dungeon at Dragonstone)
You can quibble all you want about his motivations, but the RESULTS of his actions are almost entirely negative. Review the Catelyn chapters in ACoK and ASoS, she clearly feels that Stannis, whether his intent was villainous or not, has totally shit on the fortunes of Houses Stark and Tully by killing Renly. Renly, with the full support of The Reach and the Stormlands, had a very good chance of winning at King's Landing. Stan had none, because he alienated the Tyrells, who had the most powerful army in the Seven Kingdoms. What he did gain at Storm's End he squandered at Blackwater.Â 
What difference does it make if he burned the Florent (or which Florent) for being an infidel or for treason? In my opinion, it WASN'T treason, because after losing at BW Stannis could no longer consider himself to be king. The Florent recognized that political reality, so burning him was just Stan playing 'sore loser' in the worst possible way. That's looking at how it goes down in the book. A non-king burning someone for treason is not justice, it's murder. How much worse is the show portrayal than that? Not much, IMO.

Everything the girl inherits from him ends for the Lannisters, so everything Stannis gets from the deal goes to the Lions...a poisoned gift, were they lose nothing else than Black Waters.
Remember. His main goal is to get back his keep.

3533	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-04-15	The word "Infidel" is the key here.Â 
This was just as bad as Catelyn saying "It should've been you", Asha using the word "Cunt".Â 
This type of things totally against their book counterparts, which are always better than D&D's fanfiction characters.Â 
Â 



I suppose it was only a matter of time beforeÂ Stan the ManÂ joined this "balanced thread". Did he read any of my defences of the scene as written? Or anyone else's?Â Most importantly,Â Ran's posts becauseÂ heÂ may actually knowÂ Stannis's fate because of certain TWOW chapters that would have been in ADWD. Did he not hear the brilliant Stan quips: "A good deal more than you." "I hate good many things but I suffer them all the same." "Of course I remember." It was a good scene goddamnit!


So? Even if he knows then what? That doesn't change it one thing. D&D apologists are trying to milk the "decent" portrayal.Â 
Those all quips will be forgotten since it came from Osama. The infidel word is just horrendous and that too from Stannis.Â  Â  Â

3534	FNF	2014-04-15	They've created this "Stannis the Mannis" Great Hero image, more from reading each other's posts and comments than from reading the character as written by GRRM.
The fact that Show Stannis doesn't follow that mold is simply a function of the fact that D&D aren't members of their club.


I disagree with pretty much everything you have posted here but THIS especially sticks out as completely silly. You can pick out piles of quotes in the book, even from opposing characters, which add to his 'badassery'- emphasising his most appealing traits such as his unyielding attitude and righteousness. I'm not going to pick them out because you can personally find them no problem at all. The claim that this is some sort of fabricated persona is unfounded and the quotes provided by GRRM in interviews and the books can easily be viewed as painting Stannis as a somewhat heroic figure.

What if that is the first word? No matter how great is Stephen in portrayal of Stannis, the writing leaves much to be desired.Â 
Infidel is the word we get introduced to by Stannis. From the onset of this season we get that Stannis is a religious nutjob created by D&D's fanfiction writing.
No matter what he says next is more or less irrelevant from most people's perspective, because they have got the idea that he is Westeros' Osama.Â

I can admit I was being defensive, but seeing as your first point was that this thread has nothing to do with a balanced, or at the very least, adequate critique of Show Stannis in comparison to his book counterpart, I think I had good reason. I am the OP after all, and I really did intend to facilitate some good discussion here. There's a lot of good posts scattered throughout this thread that use textual examples to support why a lot of us are dissatisfied and satisfied with D&D's interpretation, so saying that this is just a place for King's Men to whine about how they didn't get to see their non-existent super hero on the television screen is a bit dickish. That being said, you've made some interesting points, even if I don't buy your reading of the character.
Let's talk Alester though. Now, I can freely admit, having read Davos' POV a few times, that he's intended to have sympathetic qualities. It doesn't really justify him going behind Stannis' back with peace terms, those of which include selling off his only daughter so that he can get Brightwater Keep back, but still, Alester is far from evil, and we're meant to feel bad for him when we find out he's gonna get burned to death. The reason that context matters here, is because burning him for religious reasons, rather than a pretty serious treason, completely changes Stannis' ideology. Burning weirwood trees and not allowing Wildings to through the Wall unless they swear fealty are not equivalent to burning innocents arbitrarily, especially when there is no utilitarian gain to be had. This doesn't even synch up with how Stannis was portrayed last season. Yeah, he doesn't agonize over Gendry's death as much as Edric due to the different nature of their relationship, but he's still visibly distraught over it. It's jarring that the man who just a few episodes ago struggled with sacrificing an innocent to save "all the boys and girls of Westeros" from the night that never ends is now burning people for very arbitrary reasons, and I really don't think there's a good aesthetic justification for it. Let's take the main one you offered though, which was that Stannis becomes a zealot later so they're just rushing things along.
We'll assume for a moment that you're right. Stannis is going to end up as a villain, or at the very least, a strong believer in Rhillor who is willing to sacrifice innocents willy nilly to appease his new found God (he hasn't yet in the text, but we'll go with it). The reason I don't find this a very cogent justification, is because it's along the same lines as saying that Tyrion should have been treating Shae like shit in Season 2 because he's going strangle her to death at the end of Season 4. If and when he kills her in Tywin's bed, people are going to be emotionally distraught because of how brightly colored their relationship has been up to this point. Seeing Tyrion take a dark turn is going to have long term effects on those who love him, specifically because he's been shown to have so many redeeming qualities throughout the series. How we get somewhere is just as important as when, which is why changing the context here not only changes the entire direction of Stannis' arc, but it makes him more two-dimensional. We're meant as readers to sympathize with Alester, but we also understand why Stannis executes him. The prosperous winds, (which speak to the utilitarian morality that is intrinsic to the character) are another added motivation that makes the act more ambiguous for us as readers. By making Alester (Axel in this case) completely innocent, in conjunction with the use of the word "infidel", Stannis is already colored so dark that even if he does make the full jump to villain, it won't be nearly as surprising or compelling.
Now that being said, I don't think Stannis is being set up to go that way in the books. Doesn't really make sense to me, given the Winds of Winter chapter sample, and Jon Snow's growing enthusiasm for Stannis' cause. I feel like it's more likely he's set up for a more tragic heroic end, but this is really just speculation on both our ends. The fact is though, I don't think that Stannis' arc has been handled with care the last two seasons, and whether or not you like him, I don't think the show has done a good job at giving the viewer reasons to sympathize with him, with the exception of his love for Shireen. There's no amount of bromancing with Davos that's going to wash away this horrendous scene of pointless brutality, and I find it suspect that they'll even give him his due at the Wall based on their assessment of him, but I am open to the possibility that he's being portrayed as darker and more villainous here to make it more shocking when he comes through and starts doing the right thing.
When it comes to the whole Renly-Catelyn arc you mentioned, there's no question that the results of the Baratheon feud didn't bode well for the Starks, (or many people for that matter) but saying that things would have worked out had he supported Renly is as true as saying that things would have been totally fine if Renly had done his duty by Stan the Man. Stannis even laments this in SoS, remorseful for Renly's death, and regretful that they never achieved their great victory together, "one that even Robert would be proud of." There's no question that Stannis' heroism in the latter half of the book is where readers started to look at him as more than just a dark brooding hardass, (Assassinating Penrose was anything but noble) but the reason people were even willing to reassess him as a character is because he didn't senselessly murder innocent people for no reason. This is a tough pill to swallow, doesn't really have a whole lot of aesthetic justification outside of cheapening and simplifying his arc, and I'm still in the dark here for why people are so surprised at the outrage that's come as a result.

When he burns some men (for cannibalism) during the snowbound trek to Winterfell,
there is a clear implication that he is doing it as a sacrifice, and hoping that R'hllor will change his fortunes.
Â 


This is ridiculous, plainly ridiculous. When his followers ask him for a sacrifice, he says "pray harder'; he is actively planning to change his own fortunes at this point. You have no reason to read into it that way except you don't like him. Stannis never, ever,Â ever burnt anyone for simplyÂ being an unbeliever. Not once. Selyse burnt a couple while he was fighting on the Blackwater, but that's it. if you have spent any time at all on a Stannis thread you have heard this said already, and you need to go check your book facts. Yes, we are upset, the Stan-Stans. because all of Stannis' funny and noble/honourable lines haveÂ been cut, and we have been given, basically, a cartoon character instead of a very complex character.Â I am holding out for the end of this season, but I expect, based on current form, any transition to sympathy for his character will either be tarred somehow, or similarly lacking in nuance.

I agree with that. I asked the same question upthread.
There was absolutely no point of that stupid scene.Â 
It would have worked much better if Stannis had said,
" He/They tried to sell MY DAUGHTER to the abomination in King's landing".
Two birds, one stone.
3549	Ty K	2014-04-16	Can one of the complainers please explain to me why it is more acceptable to burn someone at the stake for negotiating a treaty with your enemies without permission than it is to burn a man at the stake for publicly disobeying your orders to take down your religious symbols? Both are acts of treason, both punishable by death, except one is the way it happened in your gospel and the other isn't. Its all a matter of perception.
What if I put it this way: Stannis burnt a man alive even though his intentions were to end the war and save all of their lives and even though the deal he sought with the Lannisters was more than fair given their meager position. As opposed to burning a man alive for openly disobeying royal orders and insulting the religion whose god has intervened on their side multiple times and is the only reason they still have a chance of winning the war. See what I mean about perception?
Outraged StanStan: "But it subtly changes the motivation of the character, oh noes!" Oh well, get over it. This has happened to a lot of characters and is inevitable. I think its pretty clear Stannis begrudgingly went through that whole process and the beginning of his break-away from Melisandre to being more independent is already being set up, so relax. If he is still unsympathetic at the end of this season, then you will have a reason to be upset. No one really liked Stannis all that much at this point in the book series anyways.

Â 
Â 

Â 
In the book he is still in charge at Dragonstone, so even if he doesn't personally follow R'llor he is still allowing others to be burned. Â It is not as though Mel has pulled the wool over his eyes. Â He made his choices.

3556	Ran	2014-04-16	Can one of the complainers please explain to me why it is more acceptable to burn someone at the stake for negotiating a treaty with your enemies without permission than it is to burn a man at the stake for publicly disobeying your orders to take down your religious symbols? Both are acts of treason, both punishable by death, except one is the way it happened in your gospel and the other isn't. Its all a matter of perception.It's because Stannis would never make life-or-death decisions on the basis of people's religious beliefs conforming to his own...Oh, wait. He makes the wildlings convert if they want to get south of the Wall. Never mind.

Well whatever it is. I hope the material is solid and not downright fanfiction from that episode.Â
3558	Konradsmith	2014-04-16	I could jump on you for saying fanfiction, Stan, because obviously they have the rights and whatnot. But clearly you know that that's a loaded phrase and used it anyways, so there isn't really a point.
Â 
Just remember that we don't know definitively that D and D wrote those scenes. It is likely, but right now Carice van HoutenÂ twitter picture of the premiereÂ script cover is our only piece of evidence. You have to accept the possibility that GrrM drafted that scene that you think of so venomously. (If people REALLY want to know they could ask Bryan Cogman on twitter or ask GrrM via comment on Notablog. Both sometimes answer such things.)
Â 
EDIT: Ah, Ran has made a welcome return! I love it! I don't know if there is counterargument/justification for that letting the wildlings south of the Wall via conversion business...

Â 
Good point! Not to mention that the bigger problem for Stannis was more likely that he had given the Florent (I think they used Axel not Alester in the show but can't remember...) a direct order and he disobeyed him in a really public manner by leaving those statues of the Seven up. He almost put Davos to death after the Gendry/Edric incident and that was done in secret. This was left up for all his men to see; Stannis would not allow someone to undermine his authority like that. Its no different than what Jon did to Janos Slynt, which as you probably remember Stannis gave a nod of approval to.

3563	averde	2014-04-16	I am legitimately afraid that the battle at the wall at the end of this season will play out with Jon killing the "bad" Wildlings the Thenns, then trying to get to Mance and sign a peace treaty and all of  sudden Stannis shows up and massacres a bunch of "good" Wildlings, maybe even Ygritte.

In most parts of the world the word infidel does not equate with Osama. TheÂ onlyÂ place I have seen such a link made is on these boards by Stannis fans who would have decried any word used.

I would say Americans make up a pretty large basis of the GoT tv fans. Go out and ask them what they think of when they hear the word infidel, most Americans picture the classic image of afghan mujahideen fighters and terrorists along with specifically Osama bin Laden as the face of the Taliban. I'm not saying that it's right or anything like that but it is a reality.

I personally also think that.Â 
In one of the features released, Jon is shown fighting the Magnar of Thenn, so most certainly he is killing the bad wildlings while the good wildlings will be left for Stannis to kill, just as Mance and Jon reach to a conclusion to stabilize the realm.Â
3566	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-16	I would say Americans make up a pretty large basis of the GoT tv fans.

Â 
I recognise that point and have acknowledged as much above.
3567	Lord Varys	2014-04-16	Show Stannis is actually more sympathetic than book Stannis. It's ambiguous whether book Stannis even believes in R'hllor, but show Stannis sees Mel's abilities and his own vision as a sign that R'hllor is real. Book Stannis may still using his 'red falcon', not giving a fig about Mel's religious convictions. If that's the case, then he is actually a lot worse than show Stannis because he allows Mel, Selyse, and the Queen's Men to kill people in a very horrible way despite the fact that he himself does not give a shit about their beliefs. A man who feigns to believe something and then empowers and uses religious fundamentalists to get what he wants and/or to solidify his power is much worse than a true believer.
Â 
In fact, Stannis is in this sense the very embodiment of the real world, well-educated right-wing politicians in the US. They are way too educated and intelligent to believe in the literal truth of the bible, creationism, or the existence of a god, but they still feign such a religious belief to please or unify their followers.
Â 
I have to say I like how they reinvented the Stannis-Selyse relationship. Stannis obviously is disgusted by Selyse, but this apparently was not always the case. He mentioned Selyse's condition during the Siege of Storm's End back in season 2, and it really seems that show Stannis is not as comfortable around women as book Stannis. He has Selyse repeatedly tried to conceive children, and it seems that they only got estranged when Selyse couldn't cope with her grief, became a religious nut, and started to consider Shireen a rival for Stannis' affection.
3568	TheReal_Rebel	2014-04-16	Tyrion has burned thousands alive ...That was a defensive act by Tyrion to prevent the sacking of the city by Stannis's men.
In any case, as someone who is not a Stannis fan per se but has sympathy for him and am charmed by Shireen and his relationship with Davos, I think some here are overly critical of the show.  
I think Stannis as portrayed is a complex man.  A hard man, a brilliant tactician and fearless soldier who will ultimately defeat the Bolton's, Freys, etc.  But also as a loving man towards his daughter, wife and a good and loyal friend who is unfortunately under the sway of a religious fanatic.  One who I think who has already betrayed him by not going with him to retake Winterfell where I fear the White Walkers will first show up--remember Osha & friends got around the wall by boat,
I don't think he comes off as negatively as some think.  But is a rather understandable flawed but brave man who would sacrifice himself to protect the Realm...oh and I'm American.

Book Stannis is the last thing I would call a hero. All the Targaryans burned people alive, with their dragons. Dany burned MMD alive. Not so rare, actually. Its a pretty harsh execution method, but execution method it was.Only traitors, cannibals and criminals. Stannis never expressed any anger or malice against non believers in the books, if you can shoe otherwise, prove it.

â<U+0080><U+009C>If I sound the Horn of Winter, the Wall will fall. Or so the songs would have me believe. There are those among my people who wantÂ nothing more . . .â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>But once the Wall is fallen,â<U+0080><U+009D> Dalla said, â<U+0080><U+009C>what will stop the Others?â<U+0080><U+009D>
Mance gave her a fond smile. â<U+0080><U+009C>Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a wise woman Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve found. A true queen.â<U+0080><U+009D> He turned back to Jon. â<U+0080><U+009C>Go back and tell them to open theirÂ gate and let us pass. If they do, I will give them the horn, and the Wall will stand until the end of days.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Open the gate and let them pass. Easy to say, but what must follow? Giants camping in the ruins of Winterfell? Cannibals in the wolfswood,Â chariots sweeping across the barrowlands, free folk stealing the daughters of shipwrights and silversmiths from White Harbor and fishwivesÂ off the Stony Shore? â<U+0080><U+009C>Are you a true king?â<U+0080><U+009D> Jon asked suddenly.
â<U+0080><U+009C>Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve never had a crown on my head or sat my arse on a bloody throne, if thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s what youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re asking,â<U+0080><U+009D> Mance replied. â<U+0080><U+009C>My birth is as low as aÂ manâ<U+0080><U+0099>s can get, no septonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s ever smeared my head with oils, I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t own any castles, and my queen wears furs and amber, not silk andÂ sapphires. I am my own champion, my own fool, and my own harpist. You donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t become King-beyond-the-Wall because your father was. TheÂ free folk wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t follow a name, and they donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t care which brother was born first. They follow fighters. When I left the Shadow Tower thereÂ were five men making noises about how they might be the stuff of kings. Tormund was one, the Magnar another. The other three I slew,Â when they made it plain theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>d sooner fight than follow.â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>You can kill your enemies,â<U+0080><U+009D> Jon said bluntly, â<U+0080><U+009C>but can you rule your friends? If we let your people pass, are you strong enough to makeÂ them keep the kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s peace and obey the laws?â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>Whose laws? The laws of Winterfell and Kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Landing?â<U+0080><U+009D> Mance laughed. â<U+0080><U+009C>When we want laws weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll make our own. You can keep yourÂ kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s justice too, and your kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s taxes. Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m offering you the horn, not our freedom. We will not kneel to you.â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>What if we refuse the offer?â<U+0080><U+009D> Jon had no doubt that they would. The Old Bear might at least have listened, though he would have balked atÂ the notion of letting thirty or forty thousand wildlings loose on the Seven Kingdoms. But Alliser Thorne and Janos Slynt would dismiss theÂ notion out of hand.
â<U+0080><U+009C>If you refuse,â<U+0080><U+009D> Mance Rayder said, â<U+0080><U+009C>Tormund Giantsbane will sound the Horn of Winter three days hence, at dawn.â<U+0080><U+009D>
He could carry the message back to Castle Black and tell them of the horn, but if he left Mance still alive Lord Janos and Ser Alliser wouldseize on that as proof that he was a turncloak. A thousand thoughts flickered through Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s head. If I can destroy the horn, smash it here and now . . .

â<U+0080><U+009C>Your Grace,â<U+0080><U+009D> he said, â<U+0080><U+009C>you forget. I am a Snow, not a Stark.â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s you who are forgetting,â<U+0080><U+009D> King Stannis replied.
Melisandre put a warm hand on Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s arm. â<U+0080><U+009C>A king can remove the taint of bastardy with a stroke, Lord Snow.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Lord Snow. Ser Alliser Thorne had named him that, to mock his bastard birth. Many of his brothers had taken to using it as well, some with affection, others to wound. But suddenly it had a different sound to it in Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s ears. It sounded . . . real. â<U+0080><U+009C>Yes,â<U+0080><U+009D> he said, hesitantly, â<U+0080><U+009C>kings have legitimized bastards before, but . . . I am still a brother of the Nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Watch. I knelt before a heart tree and swore to hold no lands and father no children.â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>Jon.â<U+0080><U+009D> Melisandre was so close he could feel the warmth of her breath. â<U+0080><U+009C>Râ<U+0080><U+0099>hllor is the only true god. A vow sworn to a tree has no more power than one sworn to your shoes. Open your heart and let the light of the Lord come in. Burn these weirwoods, and accept Winterfell as a gift of the Lord of Light.â<U+0080><U+009D>
...
â<U+0080><U+009C>Whoever?â<U+0080><U+009D> Stannis gave him a measuring look. â<U+0080><U+009C>Does this mean you will not wed the girl? I warn you, she is part of the price you must pay, if you want your fatherâ<U+0080><U+0099>s name and your fatherâ<U+0080><U+0099>s castle. This match is necessary, to help assure the loyalty of our new subjects. Are you refusing me, Jon Snow?â<U+0080><U+009D>
...

â<U+0080><U+009C>As you wish. But consider quickly. I am not a patient man, as your black brothers are about to discover.â<U+0080><U+009D> Stannis put a thin, fleshless hand on Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s shoulder. â<U+0080><U+009C>Say nothing of what weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve discussed here today. To anyone. But when you return, you need only bend your knee, lay your sword at my feet, and pledge yourself to my service, and you shall rise again as Jon Stark, the Lord of Winterfell.â<U+0080><U+009D>


-ASOS, Jon XI.
Â 
The reason Stannis would not accept the Wildlings as they are is the same as why no one else in his right mind would - as they are currently they are a threat to the realm. Let's not forget - They kidnap, rape, steal, murder, far more often than in the Seven Kingdoms. They accept kidnaping and rape as a legitimate marriage proposal. Thier economy is based on raiding. Last time some faction tried to establish an economy on raiding, the Wildlings' plan was to smash thier way south, carve a new kingdom from the North or even further south, and trust that the NW and the Iron Throne or whoever else would do the actual work of defending them from the Others. If you ever wanted to make a case that the burnings are to establish authority, here it is, and it is showing Stannis as better than Mormont and the others because he is actually trying to find a way around all the bad blood and the problems that come with the Wildlings. But it is not some phase Stannis is going through, it is not "going full Mel". At the same time as he is using the symbolic burning of Mance and some branches, to get the Wildlings to symbolically abandon thier old ways and accept the King's peace, laws, and become and integral part of the Seven Kingdoms, Stannis is also offering Jon a lordship. When Jon says that he has a problem with his vows holding him back from it, Mel offers that he converts. Stannis does'nt care, his only conditions are that as long as Jon makes a decision to join him, all Jon has to do is bend the knee, swear his sword to Stannis, and marry Val. Karstark did not half to convert, nor did Umber, or Mormont. Stannis won't force Jon to convert. He offers him legitimacy, assumingly pardon for deserting, and Winterfell. The only thing holding Jon back is his religious belief. Unlike Sunglass, Jon does not start as Stannis' lord, and so refusing is not an act of treason.Â 
Â 
Back to the show - If Stannis is burning people with no actual gain that we can see back on Dragonstone, it is going to mark his burning of Mance and the burning of the branches as simplyÂ more religious oppression, rather than the act of establishing authority that you try to defend here. Stannis is simply that asshole who burns people becasue Mel told him to. If the Thenns are the ones who join Stannis later on, great - we have the asshole who burns people joined by cannibals that even funny Turmund and the likeable Ygritte hate. But it's ok because Stannis does'nt look like he enjoys it? If anything, that makes it worse. He is doing something wrong and he knows it, but he is simply a puppet. How can anyone follow that?

3572	Mithras	2014-04-16	Lol. I was expecting more Stannis fans to take this bait because they are trying to achieve the impossible: i.e. to whitewash a monster. That is why they have to jump on every opportunity.
Â 
Among the â<U+0080><U+009C>burnersâ<U+0080><U+009D> spoken upthread (Aerys, Dany, Tyrion, Victarion) which ones used burning as a punishment?
Â 
Aerys: A Monster who burned whoever he feels like burning.
Dany: Her dragons burned some slavers while taking their city. She did some other cruel stuff but she did not punish anybody by burning.
Victarion: He burned those women as an offering to the Red God. At least he did not act like a hypocrite. His purpose was clear.
Tyrion: Burned most of the fleet of Stannis while defending the capitol. He did much cruel stuff but he did not punish anybody by burning. I imagine Stannis being so OWNED by the imp is a major pain-in-the-ass for some readers. He basically took the ass of Stannis, seasoned it in wildfire and handed back to him. When Tywinâ<U+0080><U+0099>s van came, the ass got fire.
Â 
This clearly makes Stannis some kind of a monster.
3573	E-Ro	2014-04-16	Take the bait? So you admit your trolling? 
Case closed. 
Anyway dany burned mmd as a punishment. Have you read the books yet?
3574	Mithras	2014-04-16	Anyway dany burned mmd as a punishment blood magic sacrifice.
3575	E-Ro	2014-04-16	Oh, and did anyone hear about that huge meeting of Taliban they just got on camera? It was all over the news. That happens right at the same time as this infidel business. It's perfect, terrorism will be on everyone's mind when they re watch this episode.
3576	E-Ro	2014-04-16	Anyway dany burned mmd as a punishment blood magic sacrifice.
Bullshit. She burned her because she turned khal drogo into a vegetable. Nice try though.
3577	sati	2014-04-16	I am legitimately afraid that the battle at the wall at the end of this season will play out with Jon killing the "bad" Wildlings the Thenns, then trying to get to Mance and sign a peace treaty and all of sudden Stannis shows up and massacres a bunch of "good" Wildlings, maybe even Ygritte.


Â 
I sincerely believe that the showrunners realize that would be a fatal blow in the eyes of all Stannis fans and those who defended the decisions made in the show would join the riot. In other words - that would be the dumbest decision possible and would show their absolute lack of respect for the character, source material and fans, so I hope it's not gonna happen.
3578	Bayard	2014-04-16	I think this entire topic is misguided. We are all book readers here, we all have our own opinion about Stannis, but are we really objective when we try to discuss the show? I don't think so. Some think that D&D aren't portraying a different Stannis, or that they are keeping the good stuff for the latter half of the season. IMO they aren't, they dislike him, they will diminish all his great moments, even the battle at the wall. But again, this doesn't matter, because me, like all the rest, already have a formed image for Stannis, the one from the books.
Â 
What really is important is how the other viewers, the unsullied see him. I've been watching a lot of vlogs online, especially on youtube, they are overwhelmingly against Stannis. So, do the casual viewers see the same Stannis from the books? No, they don't. Yesterday I went to a party, and the discussion turned at one moment towards the death of Joffrey and GOT, so I took advantage of this to see what they thought about Stannis. So, from around 10 people, all of them thought he is one of the villains of the series, a person with no real will power easily manipulated by Melisandre (and surprisingly a couple thought by Davos as well). From all my friends only one said he liked Stannis, "because he's so crazy".
Â 
Scene by scene, burning by burning, that's the image he got on screen: a crazy, obsessed man. I'm Eastern European, we didn't have the terrorist scare like people in other countries, and even to me infidel sounded very bad. I immediately thought about the purging of the crusades. We can go back and forth about the meaning of the word, but why bother??? It's a strong word adds another element to the villainy image that HBO-Stannis already has. They are not planning a redemption arc for him. They have a villain they will use it to the end.
Â 
PS: Stannis is not even in my top 5 favorite characters in the books.

3580	Clariana	2014-04-16	I really liked Stannis's time in this episode. The way that D and D describe it in the "Inside the Episode" video is very measured actually. Yes, he's committed himself more to Mel's ways but its still practically-motivated. It's true that he never accepts this much of her ways in the books (and of course all of this is off-screen/invented stuff anyways)Â but it made for a well-written, well-acted scene. It was obvious that Stan had disdain for his wife's mumbo-jumbo and that he uncomfortable and unimpressed by the ritual anyways. That was clear in Dillane's bearing throughout the beach scene. His use of the word "infidel" obviously drew a lot of your ire, but he was quick to explain the real reason; the guy disobeyed him.
Â 
Also he had some of his best lines yet in the dinner scene. "I hate a good many things but I suffer them all the same" is a great one for instance. Dillane pulled if off really well, especially him fiddling with his food and his curt responses to Selyse. Those of you who are in panic mode ought to rewatch the episode and calm yourselves.


Â 
 Â  Looking at him when departing from the burning you could see his face was full of distaste. It shouldn't be forgotten that when he uses the word "infidel" the Red Woman, Selyse and other fanatics are all within earshot. But anyway "infidel" has two meanings the religious one and a more general usage which simply means "disloyal". It was very plain to me, and I like Stannis but would not say I am a fan, that here was a man acting to an extent under duress.
Â 
Consider the political situation, he is a loser, confined to a small island, he lacks personal charisma and he knows it... How can he rally people around him, stop desertion, foist loyalty? The only way is religion, so, unpalatable though that may be, that is what he is doing. It's politics, no more, no less.

3581	Darkbringer	2014-04-16	Bullshit. She burned her because she turned khal drogo into a vegetable. Nice try though. Don't bother, buddy. Life is too short for troll-slaying.
3582	Ran	2014-04-16	The Inside the Episode piece (got it linked at our <a href="http://www.westeros....ion_and_TheRose">episode guide</a> in the Extras section) which I think others have referenced seems to make it pretty plain that "full Melisandre" is not the same as "full fanatic". He's throwing his lot with her, and so the burning and so on seems to be, to some extent, for her benefit in regards to his relationship with her; he needs her support, and will do anything to keep it. But he's not genuinely interested in the religious thing. He's very pragmatic in that respect, which is, frankly, pretty much exactly how he is in the novels.If he needs to burn a few people to win his crown and defend the realms of men, he'll do it.
3583	ladyinblack	2014-04-16	I think D & D deserve a weekend in the Dreadfort after that terrible scene. Going out of your way to make a character look bad just really puts me off this show and ruined the episode for me.

Weekend at the Dreadfort.   Lol
Agree
3584	The Drunkard	2014-04-16	Show Stannis is actually more sympathetic than book Stannis. It's ambiguous whether book Stannis even believes in R'hllor, but show Stannis sees Mel's abilities and his own vision as a sign that R'hllor is real. Book Stannis may still using his 'red falcon', not giving a fig about Mel's religious convictions. If that's the case, then he is actually a lot worse than show Stannis because he allows Mel, Selyse, and the Queen's Men to kill people in a very horrible way despite the fact that he himself does not give a shit about their beliefs. A man who feigns to believe something and then empowers and uses religious fundamentalists to get what he wants and/or to solidify his power is much worse than a true believer.


Â 
Book Stannis quite clearly thinks Melisandre is on to something, he's just not sure where to start believing and where to stop. So we get him testing Melisandre with the leeches, being quite derisive of them until all three 'worked'. We get him questioning Melisandre with some dismay as to why R'hllor would choose him over his much more popular brothers. We get him scaring Davos with his conviction in regards to the 'great war' being a real war he needs to fight. We get him threatening Melisandre with a painful death if she's deceiving him, and so on.
Â 
Show Stannis simply dives right in, head first, and as a result we get him willing to kill Gendry as soon as he gets his hands on him, as well as burning people for refusing to convert, burning people for speaking against Melisandre, and so on.
Â 
Book Stannis may not believe in R'hllor (I'd argue he does), but he's certainly taking the threat that Melisandre talks about seriously. He just isn't swallowing up everything she says and asking for seconds, like on the show.
3585	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-04-16	Don't bother, buddy. Life is too short for troll-slaying.


I agree. I gave up arguing against him in the threads in the general section.Â 
If Stannis is a monster then i guess Dany is the greatest monster ever lived.Â 
And well Ramsey is just a sweet summer child. #ACertainPoster'sLogic

3586	Denam_Pavel	2014-04-16	Can one of the complainers please explain to me why it is more acceptable to burn someone at the stake for negotiating a treaty with your enemies without permission than it is to burn a man at the stake for publicly disobeying your orders to take down your religious symbols? Both are acts of treason, both punishable by death, except one is the way it happened in your gospel and the other isn't. Its all a matter of perception.
What if I put it this way: Stannis burnt a man alive even though his intentions were to end the war and save all of their lives and even though the deal he sought with the Lannisters was more than fair given their meager position. As opposed to burning a man alive for openly disobeying royal orders and insulting the religion whose god has intervened on their side multiple times and is the only reason they still have a chance of winning the war. See what I mean about perception?
Outraged StanStan: "But it subtly changes the motivation of the character, oh noes!" Oh well, get over it. This has happened to a lot of characters and is inevitable. I think its pretty clear Stannis begrudgingly went through that whole process and the beginning of his break-away from Melisandre to being more independent is already being set up, so relax. If he is still unsympathetic at the end of this season, then you will have a reason to be upset. No one really liked Stannis all that much at this point in the book series anyways.


Â 
It's not more acceptable. But it was Stannis. And what do you mean, publicly disobeying orders? It's not like Axell has lands on Dragonstone. All he's doing is keeping symbols of the Seven in the privacy of his own living situation. We don't hear anything about him publicly insulting the red god. And if it was treason he was burned for then Stannis should've said that. "infidels" doesn't mean Bin Laden to me, but it sure doesn't mean treason either.
Â 
And let's not forget that Ned died confessing his treason, let's not pretend Shireen would've been safe. And Alester was burned to booster the wind in their sails,Â gruesome as it waa, it had a practical purpose. All this accomplishes is losing them the men and ships that Axell apparently brought to their cause.
Â 
And subtle? What's subtle about it? In the books he's already going to the Wall. Here Davos and Mel both straight up failed to convince him. Again, this season takes places several weeks after the last one. That's a subtle difference to you?
3587	FNF	2014-04-16	What I don't understand at all is why they can't just have some scenes where Team Stannis are already at sea? Then they can offer the occasional sacrifice to grant them good winds, show them divert to Braavos/deal with the Iron Bank and then finally make them disappear for a couple of episodes before the battle at the Wall? Why they are still on Dragonstone when it looks like they have done bugger all is beyond me.
3588	Nyrhex	2014-04-16	The Inside the Episode piece (got it linked at our <a href="http://www.westeros....ion_and_TheRose">episode guide</a> in the Extras section) which I think others have referenced seems to make it pretty plain that "full Melisandre" is not the same as "full fanatic".

If he needs to burn a few people to win his crown and defend the realms of men, he'll do it.


Â 
You are missing context and tone.
Â 
Unlike the books, we have no context to show how this burning goes along with saving the world. Stannis burns people for no other reason than not converting. The show does not explain how that helps him to save the world. Hell, it does not even show that it helps him get the crown. He does it simply because Mel told him and he takes her at her word. Logically, he is wasting men and getting even further from the crown, but he trusts Mel 100%. That has never been the case in the books, as even when he is moments from making a decision to burn Edric, he orders Mel to swear on her life that it will work or she would die by inches. He has doubts every step of the way. In the show he is more of "meh" about killing people who have done no wrong, because Mel told him to do it.
Â 
That is theÂ opposite of the books, where Stannis considers burning an innocent only if he has proof that it will save the world. The other burnings are of people who are already going to die, and the burningsÂ are simply one of the types of executions we see Stannis contemplating/using (together with hanging and decapitation). They don't replace the others, as we see in the Theon gift chapter how Stannis is willing to give a clean death to the Karstarks if they confess.Â Completely different from burning infidels who refuse to convert.
Â 
I agree that Stannis would sacrefice one, or a few people, to save the world. He knows full well that he is one of those people, as he tells Davos that he knows the cost after seeing Â a vision of a king consumed by his own crown. The point is that in the show Stannis did not tell Davos about his vision, nor is he telling us that the burnings are to save the world. It's because the guy was an infidel.
Â 
The context and tone of the burnings depitct Stannis in a totally different light.
3589	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-04-16	The Inside the Episode piece (got it linked at our <a href="http://www.westeros....ion_and_TheRose">episode guide</a> in the Extras section) which I think others have referenced seems to make it pretty plain that "full Melisandre" is not the same as "full fanatic".

If he needs to burn a few people to win his crown and defend the realms of men, he'll do it.So he just jumps from strugling between killing or not Gendry to get himself a DRAGON to burning Shireens uncle with no other porpouse than to make the Red W happy? This doesnt even make sense in D&D already twisted logic.
And Im not even bringing up book Stannis who refuses to burn Edric through half a book with two leeaches already working. Big difference between "Robb Stark was killed by his bannermen" "get of me woman" "he got you there, two is not three"....mocks to Alex, Selyse and even Mel, against mr happy trigger who wants to burn Gendry from day one.

I have read the books but apparently you have not.
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>You will not hear me scream,â<U+0080><U+009D> Mirri responded as the oil dripped from her hair and soaked her clothing.
â<U+0080><U+009C>I will,â<U+0080><U+009D> Dany said, â<U+0080><U+009C>but it is not your screams I want, only your life. I remember what you told me. Only death can pay for life.â<U+0080><U+009D>


Lol. So firstly, even though if you don't Dany was burning her, at least in part, out of revenge for the death of her husband and unborn child, then you just weren't paying attention. It's the reason she chooses Mirri for the ritual rather than any other random person. Secondly, since you find Dany's burning of Mirri acceptable on the grounds that it's "blood magic" for a specific goal, it might be wise of you to consider that Stannis, the "monster" as you call him, burns Alester to ensure prosperous winds so that they can reach the Wall in time to save the Watch from the Others. To be frank, while burning Alester isn't a righteous act, Stannis' intentions are actually a bit more noble here than Dany's all in all, considering the lives at stake. But yeah, context does matter when you're assessing a character's actions. How would viewers have felt if Dany simply burned Mirri without a proper precedent on the show? These ludicrous rationalizations for the show are starting to get old, especially when they dissolve into the sort of drivel that you're posting.Â
3591	averde	2014-04-16	Â 
I sincerely believe that the showrunners realize that would be a fatal blow in the eyes of all Stannis fans and those who defended the decisions made in the show would join the riot. In other words - that would be the dumbest decision possible and would show their absolute lack of respect for the character, source material and fans, so I hope it's not gonna happen.

I also agree it would be a final straw of sorts for many book readers who watch the show and have supported the tv guys creation of Stannis so far. My last straw was the whole infidel thing this season so my hopes aren't high. It just seems like all the pieces are in place for Stannis to be a bad guy at the battle for the wall. A great many Wildlings have been introduced and are pretty sympathetic, as someone else pointed out through a video it's clear Jon kills the "bad" Wildlings Thenns.

I remain hopeful because of Stannis mentioning how he suffers the things he hates and the inclusion of his care for Shireen. Why do that if they wanted to make him the villain at the Wall?

Every season I never give up hope for a better written Stannis, and I actually think the actors really good for the the role. I just felt that after viewing Stannis burning an infidel and what not it makes him seem like an even more horrible human being that he loves his daughter because we know he has human feelings. It's like when historians talk about Hitler love of dogs. 
Like I said though I hope I'm wrong and show Stannis is headed towards a redemption and I'll love it, I just want to point out the evidence that is leaning towards that not happening.

Â 
Well, there is that Bryan Cogman interview? tweet? something, where he he implies that Stannis is being shown in such an unfavourable light to make a starker contrast with his later story.
3595	Bronn Urgundy	2014-04-16	What difference does it make if he burned the Florent (or which Florent) for being an infidel or for treason? In my opinion, it WASN'T treason, because after losing at BW Stannis could no longer consider himself to be king. The Florent recognized that political reality, so burning him was just Stan playing 'sore loser' in the worst possible way. That's looking at how it goes down in the book. A non-king burning someone for treason is not justice, it's murder. How much worse is the show portrayal than that? Not much, IMO.


Â 
Wrong! His claim didnt die at BW. Anyway, execution for treason offers us sympathy for both parties, this scene takes away our choice completely. Poor innocent Axell 
Â

Â 
This has crossed my mind, butÂ on topÂ previous Stannis and all his best lines removed or bastardised, combined with shit like Jorah the little boy sex trafficker angel, you can understand our reservations?
Â 


It's because Stannis would never make life-or-death decisions on the basis of people's religious beliefs conforming to his own...
Oh, wait. He makes the wildlings convert if they want to get south of the Wall. Never mind.


Â 
Still yet to see that as a religious conversion as opposed to a symbolic act for a violent people.
3596	Mithras	2014-04-16	Lol. So firstly, even though if you don't Dany was burning her, at least in part, out of revenge for the death of her husband and unborn child, then you just weren't paying attention. It's the reason she chooses Mirri for the ritual rather than any other random person.


Â 
She could have just get MMD beheaded or tied to her horse until she dies like the wineseller, if her primary motive was to punish her. I am talking about choosing to burn people alive as a punishment rather than hanging or beheading them. Danyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s primary motive was to work that magic and MMD was the best person she had for the sacrifice.

I thought you and your Stanfan buddies were claiming that Alester was burned because of his treason. I claim that if he burned him primarily for the wind, then he is no different than Dany and if he burned him primarily for his treason, he is no different than Aerys.

3597	Frumpus	2014-04-16	Stannis's actions in this episode are in line with his character.
Â 
The problem of course is that this situation, him burning his wife's brother for heresy, is exactly the sort of thing to make the audience turn against him. If that's what the writers wanted, then they accomplished it.
3598	Mr Fixit	2014-04-16	If majority of the readers and the show makers think of Stannis as a villain...


Â 
Was there a poll I missed?
3599	Belisarius09	2014-04-16	I decided to watch HBO's inside the episode to see what they said of this. David Benioff was quite reasonable, and explained Stannis's struggle. Â He's witnessed Mel's power, he knows she can make a shadow vagina monster. Â He remains a skeptic but he's fighting to survive and she is an asset. Â That said he is very annoyed by his wife's fervent fanaticism and he tolerates it. Â OK. Â That works for me. Â David Benioff seems very reasonable in his approach to Stannis. Â 
Â 
How about Dan Weiss? Â Stannis is jumping in with both feet embracing the religion. Â He is burning those who don't agree with him and embrace the red god, he's casting all bets with Melisandre....

I said that Dany chooses to sacrifice Mirri "at least in part" as a form of revenge for the death of her husband and unborn child. Nice of you to overlook my post and then create a strawman out of it. But yeah, we'll go point by point here.
Â 
Perhaps you don't find this use of sacrifice "acceptable" but you seemed to have been defending it on the the strange grounds that having this woman burned alive in order to get dragons is somehow less morally egregious than using it as a form of punishment (I'd say it functions as both but whatever). If I misrepresented your position, my bad, but in both the case of Dany and Stannis, there are multiple motivations which drive these burnings. Stannis burns Alester for planning to sell his daughter to the Lannisters (a point you haven't really bothered talking about because it conflicts with your oversimplification of this story arc) and offering peace terms without his leave, thereby gaining back Brightstone Keep and ending the war, but also, as the text tells us, because the sacrifice will ensure prosperous winds, hastening them to the Wall to save the Night's Watch. I don't know why it's so mind boggling for you that human beings are complex and that they can have more than one reason to follow a certain course of action?Â 
Â 
And regarding your point that this admiration, or at the very least respect for Book Stannis is confined to a very small vocal minority that conflicts with the vast majority of readers, you wouldn't mind showing us all the statistics would you? I'm certain you've compiled all the data and have a strong evidence to support this claim. It's also very telling that you lumped me and all my "Stan buddies" together into a single entity, with no individual thoughts whatsoever. I've argued from the beginning here that there are multiple reasons for why Stannis burns Alester, and that while it isn't righteous, the book arc is far more compelling and his reasoning is more understandable. This change in context does mean a great deal, as there isn't even a practical gain to be had from this sacrifice and it paints him as a fanatic without any agency. Just because you happen to have this disdain for the character, (based more on your hatred of his fans, rather than the character from the actual text from what it seems) doesn't really make this rather large deviation from the source material aesthetically justifiable. Even if you hate Stannis, there's no doubt that utilitarian ethics are at the core of his character, and stripping him of that in favor of religious fanaticism does nothing but cheapen this arc.
Â 
Also, since Stannis is just some stupid villain in your reading, would you mind explaining why George R Martin finds his rescue of the Wall to be a righteous act? You know, the action that defines his character and proves that he is in fact a "righteous man" despite the mistakes he's made along the way? He also points out that Stannis is one of the few characters to fully understand that the real battle is beyond the Wall, which is why when you say Stannis wasn't going north to the fight the Others, it falls upon you to explain this quote:
Â 
Stannis pointed north. "There is where I'll find the foe that I was born to fight."
Â 
Â 
Regarding your point about whether or not Dany's dragons are more "useful" than Stannis and Lightbringer, I spoke about moral intention and utility when I analyzed their different reasons for sacrifice. It's quite possible that Dany and her dragons, (not that it's working out too great for her at the moment) could be the turning point in the battle with the white walkers later on, but the fact is, she sacrificed a woman, (who is portrayed equally as sympathetic as Alester) so she could wake up Dragons for the purpose of conquest. At least in the case of Stannis, whatever you think of him as a person, Alester's death was at least partially motivated by utilitarian motives, since those winds are arguably what made the difference in them reachng Castle Black in time. Still, I think it's important to note that burning people alive is never a good thing, whether its for sacrifice or for punishment as you seem to be fixated on. Fans of the character clearly don't like that he burns people, but I think that your disdain for his fandom has clouded you from seeing that this lack of nuance has cheapened him as a character and over simplified his story arc.Â

Â He's witnessed Mel's power, he knows she can make a shadow vagina monster. Â He remains a skeptic but he's fighting to survive and she is an asset. Â That said he is very annoyed by his wife's fervent fanaticism and he tolerates it. Â OK. Â That works for me. Â David Benioff seems very reasonable in his approach to Stannis. Â 
Â 
How about Dan Weiss? Â Stannis is jumping in with both feet embracing the religion. Â He is burning those who don't agree with him and embrace the red god, he's casting all bets with Melisandre....
Â 
Fuck you Dan.
Â 
Here's the link. Â

Â 
Weiss has always been the worst of the two, like with the Stannis/Renly parley, as always, Stannis got all the criticisms and Renly (if I recall correctly) got none, it was basically a case of "Oh yeah, Renly thinks he'd make a better King than Stannis, which he undoubtedly would *self satisfied smirk* because of... err, reasons. So he decides to do it" without mentioning the drawbacks, and what a dick move that is, the fact that it helps divide a Kingdom, that Renly is starving a city and laughing about it. No, Renly is totally wonderful of course, and then goes on to point out Stannis' faults, which basically sounded like "well, all he has is a claim, but since we plan on completely hiding the 'justice and law' side of his character from viewers and make him look like a religious lapdog, since we want to put what makes him stand out as a good character worthy of some degree of loyalty more on Daenerys to make her look really awesome, yeah, Stannis is ridiculous and nobody wants him blah blah blah. Obsessed with birthright, wants the Throne, etc."
Â 
I get that I am paraphrasing and going a bit overboard, but watching Weiss is like reading the worst criticisms aimed at Stannis, most of which can be efficiently countered, except this guy is supposed to have artistic integrity or something. But hey, I've said in other threads they might just be fooling with us.
Â 
But you know those Daenerys fans that can't give Stannis any credit and demonise everything he does, and those Stannis fans that do the reverse, well, sometimes it feels like the show is being run by the former without the latter to balance it out. I get it, I get it, changes maybe necessary, and when they talk they are talking about their show interpretations of the character, but it can be quite an irritation, its like a giant simplifying, taking away the murkier aspects in favour of blacker and whiter alternatives.
Â 
This isn't one of the worse ones though, since as mentioned before in this thread, it is a very petty version of what happened to Sunglass and the Rambtons, its just that word innit, 'infidel'.

Was there a poll I missed?


How has he not been depicted as a villain so far?
He's 1) had innocent people executed, 2) killed his own brother, 3) stuck rigidly to a lawful alignment that makes him look lawful evil, not lawful good. The only characters from the whole Dragonstone side that anyone's rooting for are Davos and Shireen.
Â 
I'm sure D&D want him depicted as a neutral third party that antagonizes everyone else, and that is probably GRRM's intention as well, but the sad fact is that Stannis as he's depicted on the tv show is merely viewed as a minor (not even major) villain. Most of the tv show-only audience will probably be shocked that he gets to live for quite a few more seasons if not the rest of the show's run.
Â 
edit: Stannis is a villain now, but the audience will probably root for him once he moves his forces to the north to engage against the Boltons and Freys. So he can have his heel turn moment there assuming they don't deviate too much from the books.

He was responding to another poster who claims the majority of book readers see Stannis as a villain (hence the bit about missing a poll). I do mostly agree with your assessment though. And it really is a shame, not just because I care about this storyline, but because I think it could have made for really great teleivison if they had handled it with more care. Who knows though. Still holding out hope for that redemption arc.

It's not more acceptable. But it was Stannis. And what do you mean, publicly disobeying orders? It's not like Axell has lands on Dragonstone. All he's doing is keeping symbols of the Seven in the privacy of his own living situation. We don't hear anything about him publicly insulting the red god. And if it was treason he was burned for then Stannis should've said that. "infidels" doesn't mean Bin Laden to me, but it sure doesn't mean treason either.
Â 
And let's not forget that Ned died confessing his treason, let's not pretend Shireen would've been safe. And Alester was burned to booster the wind in their sails,Â gruesome as it waa, it had a practical purpose. All this accomplishes is losing them the men and ships that Axell apparently brought to their cause.
Â 
And subtle? What's subtle about it? In the books he's already going to the Wall. Here Davos and Mel both straight up failed to convince him. Again, this season takes places several weeks after the last one. That's a subtle difference to you?


Â 
I assumed Axel has statues to the Seven set up like they had at Dragonstone, something that would be highly visible. The infidel line is getting thrown way out of proportion. What term would people suggest they have used besides infidel, given its the appropriate word for what he is saying? It doesn't even make a substantial difference in his reasoning. Axel was ordered to take up the new religion and he refused. Stannis has the fiery heart of the Lord of Light in his sigil, he is going to make it the official religion when/if he conquers Westeros. Disobeying Stannis on this makes Axel both an infidel and a traitor.
Â 
Ned died because Joffrey is an idiot, and that was only after he had been captured and lost all leverage. There was no guarantee burning Axel was going to make the winds pick up either unless you think, gasp, that Book Stannis's faith actually compelled him to kill a man. You can rationalize it both ways all day long, which was my point about perceptions, Stannis burnt a man alive at the stake and I don't think it paints him in any worse of a light to have done it for disobeying one type of order than another.
Â 
None of that has to do with motivation. I meant that Stannis begrudgingly accepting the Lord of Light as opposed to being completely agnostic isn't all that massive of a change. The broad strokes of his uncertainty and pragmatic intentions are still there, they are just playing it a different way. Even then, the things you are mentioning aren't even big changes. They had to stretch Stannis' arc out for pacing reasons. Just because he hasn't went to the Wall yet doesn't mean he isn't going to. We only saw one scene with them and it didn't touch upon what their future plans were in it. That should be next episode after hearing about Joffrey's death.

Â 
Stannis doesn't give a crap about Raloo. He only sees it as a tool to further his cause. Axell was sentenced to die no matter what just the method of execution differed because Mel told him to burn him for the magical benefits that it would provide which appealed to Stannis because he is utilitarian and he does believe in Mel's power.
Â 
He's not going to make the God of Light the official religion of Westeros and there is no mention that he is going to.
Â 
Also there are probably many people that are going to refuse to take down their idols and refuse to convert. That means that Stannis is going to burn huge portions of the population something which Book Stannis would never do.
Â 
How can you root for Stannis then? You can't at least not in good consciousness.

3619	jons nissa	2014-04-16	Â 
You are missing context and tone.
Â 
Unlike the books, we have no context to show how this burning goes along with saving the world. Stannis burns people for no other reason than not converting. The show does not explain how that helps him to save the world. Hell, it does not even show that it helps him get the crown. He does it simply because Mel told him and he takes her at her word. Logically, he is wasting men and getting even further from the crown, but he trusts Mel 100%. That has never been the case in the books, as even when he is moments from making a decision to burn Edric, he orders Mel to swear on her life that it will work or she would die by inches. He has doubts every step of the way. In the show he is more of "meh" about killing people who have done no wrong, because Mel told him to do it.
Â 
That is theÂ opposite of the books, where Stannis considers burning an innocent only if he has proof that it will save the world. The other burnings are of people who are already going to die, and the burningsÂ are simply one of the types of executions we see Stannis contemplating/using (together with hanging and decapitation). They don't replace the others, as we see in the Theon gift chapter how Stannis is willing to give a clean death to the Karstarks if they confess.Â Completely different from burning infidels who refuse to convert.
Â 
I agree that Stannis would sacrefice one, or a few people, to save the world. He knows full well that he is one of those people, as he tells Davos that he knows the cost after seeing Â a vision of a king consumed by his own crown. The point is that in the show Stannis did not tell Davos about his vision, nor is he telling us that the burnings are to save the world. It's because the guy was an infidel.
Â 
The context and tone of the burnings depitct Stannis in a totally different light.


Â 
he has doubts but is still willing to make the sacrifices. i'm not clear how so many believe a bit of doubt or even tons and tons of it (which was not the case!) washes away all the ramifications of making a decision like burning someone alive. he isn't sure but he knows he needs to do something and melisandre is offering to provide all sorts of miracles. he is indeed trusting in her in the books and willing to give her what she wants because she says she can deliver.Â 
Â 
and he makes the decision to go through with sacrificing his own nephew because of melisandre's words alone. yes, she proves that her leeches can kill someone as far as stannis is concerned but does nothing to prove edric's death can save anything. how does one prove that? in fact, to date, stannis has only seen melisandre's magic kill NOT create a miracle that will wake a stone dragon and save the world thereby allowing him to finally get the throne. stannis agrees to a sacrifice based on the hope that 3 leeches will somehow translate into saving the realm and being crowned. he is going on faith, hope and desperation and is determined to do much and more in his quest.Â

3620	SkaggCannibal	2014-04-16	It may not be a balanced view, but I can see the argument of D&D having made Stannis the villain of the show.
Â 
I'm still hoping on a more nuanced show-depiction when he goes to the Wall, but I have my doubts. I think it will be shown as a situation were the bad guy accidently does something good, but only because he still has his eyes fixed on the evil masterplan, "obsessed with his birthright" only to become a "terrible King", to put it into D&D own words. I don't think we will get the redemption arc (book!Stannis doesn't even need any redemption) Stannis deserves.

You're wrong. Read the books again. Stannis never agrees to burn Edric just like he never sentences Davos to death. It's looking like he's going to go that route but he never says yes Â and that's important.

you are confusing the show with the book. in the show melisandre tells stannis that davos has work to do. in the books, the scene ends with davos reading the note from the watch. it is left to the reader to imagine what happens next but it definitely stands to reason that stannis seeks confirmation that some disaster is approaching the wall, which mel probably provides, but that is speculation.
Â 
saying that he was willing to do something but his action is intervened by fate seems very important to you however, fate interceding does not absolve anyone of the decision and that is what is being discussed. the fact that stannis had made these decisions and everything in that scene shows that he was prepared to go through with choice. but if it makes you feel better about him then yes, he wanted to do these things but was prevented from carrying it out.

Again, subtle character differences are going to happen. He has said in the show that the only reason he believes in the Lord of Light is because he has brought him results. That is why he is going along with it, it is still about utility for him. He just believes in the religion more broadly in the show as opposed to believing solely in Mel's abilities. I don't see why this makes a huge difference as to how he is perceived by viewers.
Â 
Stannis had the sept and the weirwood at Dragonstone destroyed, Jon was sure he was going to do the same at Winterfell. Stannis wouldn't allow any Widlings through the Wall unless they took the Lord of Light as their god (meaning if they didn't, he would let the Others take them, as they say). Melisandre has made it clear on multiple occasions that her religion is incompatible with those other ones and she is looking to convert everyone she can. There is no reason to think he isn't trying to make it the official religion.

Â 
Show Stannis goes north because Mel told him to.
Â 
And Show Stannis didn't execute Davos because Mel told him to.Â 
Â 
Show Stannis has no agency of his own. He is a puppet of Mel. It's not hard to see that. You have to take it all in to figure what they're trying to turn Stannis into.
Â 
Hell look how they portrayed Renly in comparison to Stannis. Show Renly is a serious, thoughtful, educated person while Book Renly is a douche with entitlement issues. Also they made it seem like he sincerely respected Brienne when Book Renly mocked Brienne behind her back.
Â 
And Book Stannis did that to the Wildlings as a show that they were his men now rather than because he actually cares about converting them for religion's sake.Â 
Â 
Jon was sure of that, but he also thought that Mel might try to burn Mance's son. Doesn't mean it's true.

These aren't subtle differences. These are huge.

Book Renly was also quick with his tongue. â<U+0080><U+009C>Renly offered me a peach. At our parley. Mocked me, defied me, threatened me, and offered me a peach. I thought he was drawing a blade and went for mine own. Was that his purpose, to make me show fear? Or was it one of his pointless jests?
Â 
And Book Stannis did that to the Wildlings as a show that they were his men now rather than because he actually cares about converting them for religion's sake.Â 
This makes zero sense. He would not let them pass unless they converted which meant death for those that did not. He could have allowed them to keep their god's but swear to keeping the Kings laws. He chose to make conversion a point of emphasis. If he gets the throne, those that follow the seven or old gods will also be his subjects. If "his people" are those that follow LoL, than what will he do to those who reject conversion?

I re-quoted this because I find it quite funny and ironic. Didn't notice this the first time I read it. Here you criticize D&D for portraying Renly as "a douche with entitlement issues". In the very next statement you criticize D&D for not making Renly act like a douche to Brienne. Lol wut.Â

3635	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-04-16	D&D Logic.
Stannis, Mel and Renly meet in land.
Melissandre needs Davos to take her to Renly by ship.
D&D logic.
3636	Nyrhex	2014-04-16	Â 
he has doubts but is still willing to make the sacrifices. i'm not clear how so many believe a bit of doubt or even tons and tons of it (which was not the case!) washes away all the ramifications of making a decision like burning someone alive. he isn't sure but he knows he needs to do something and melisandre is offering to provide all sorts of miracles. he is indeed trusting in her in the books and willing to give her what she wants because she says she can deliver.Â 
Â 
and he makes the decision to go through with sacrificing his own nephew because of melisandre's words alone. yes, she proves that her leeches can kill someone as far as stannis is concerned but does nothing to prove edric's death can save anything. how does one prove that? in fact, to date, stannis has only seen melisandre's magic kill NOT create a miracle that will wake a stone dragon and save the world thereby allowing him to finally get the throne. stannis agrees to a sacrifice based on the hope that 3 leeches will somehow translate into saving the realm and being crowned. he is going on faith, hope and desperation and is determined to do much and more in his quest.Â 


Â 
Then I think you need to re-read Davos IV, V, VI in ASOS.
Â 
Stannis sees a vision with his own eyes, of the Fist of the First Men, and is certain that what Mel is saying about a battle for the Dawn, against a cold that never ends, is true. From that vision he agrees to use the leeches that are already filled with Edric's blood because he was sick and was leeched. The three leeches ending up seeming to perform as required prove that Mel's use of King's Blood indeed has the power she claimed to have. The part about a battle for the Dawn Stannis is already sure about from his first vision, which he would later realise was from north of the Wall. The doubts Stannis has are not that a great evil is coming, they are that Stannis is the one that needs to lead the fight against it, and that Mel has the power that she claims to aid him in that. Exactly because those suspicions Stannis still makes Mel swear on her life even after proof-of-concept with the leeches worked.
How can Mel prove that she can creat life? Only death can pay for life, so how can she prove she can bring something to life without killing something else? A sacrifice is never easy, or it is no true sacrifice. If there is no sacrefice, you can't bring something to life. That's the whole point. Stannis knows that there is a great evil coming, he has this option that he can test to a limit without losing anything, but never realy prove that it's 100% guaranteed until it's too late. And he calls it out:Â 
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>â<U+0080><U+0094>is one boy! He may be the best boy who ever drew breath and it would not matter. My duty is to the realm.â<U+0080><U+009D> His hand swept across the
Painted Table. â<U+0080><U+009C>How many boys dwell in Westeros? How many girls? How many men, how many women? The darkness will devour them all,
she says. The night that never ends. She talks of prophecies . . . a hero reborn in the sea, living dragons hatched from dead stone . . . she
speaks of signs and swears they point to me. I never asked for this, no more than I asked to be king. Yet dare I disregard her?â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
He can't take the chance that she is right and he refuses because to try and prove that it works 100% would potentially risk an innocent. There is simply too much on the line here for playing safe.
Â 
Instead of this, the show has Stannis trying to burn Gendry after one king is dead, and then even after he knows what Sam wrote in the letter about the Others coming, Stannis is still sitting on his hands on Dragonstone, burning infidels because they refused to tear down thier idols. It's not even remotely similar to the character in the books, who is faced with the classic "1 life versus the world" question. It does'nt make sense that he knows what he knows and is still on Dragonstone. It does'ntÂ make sense that he would burn infidels.Â It does'nt make sense that Davos is still alive after Stannis burns others for not converting, and if anything here is unclear, it's how people try to defend D&D's presentation of Stannis with these weak defenses that Stannis is essentially the same thing. No, it's not the same thing. It's a lot less gery, and the watchers are spoon fed that this guy is the asshole that burns people because the red witch told him to do it. He is "obsessed with his birth-right", and will "do anything to get it". Not a fucking word that these actions are aimed at saving the human fucking race from extinction. The whole tone of Stannis' actions is changed from 1 act of evil to save humankind - to a bunch of acts of evil to gain the throne for his own selfish obsession with his birth-right. And even those actions of evil are fucking retarded when you realise that he is on an island, and is not gaining anything from this. It's not even Tywin killing a few at dinner than 10,000 on the field evil, it's just fanatical evil. And Stannis being the religious fanatic or burning people simply because the religious fanatic told him to, are one and the same here.Â
3637	Konradsmith	2014-04-16	Â Senor, Well they were meeting on a coast. They seemed to be moored and waiting on their ships rather than encamped. That's not so implausible, though yes the logistics were a little muddier because they conflated the two shadow baby instances. Generally this speaks more to cinematic or televisual logic than "D and D logic". On TV or in movies you can present things that are logistically vague as long as they flow and make sense while your watching them. D and D aren't to blame for that.

The show had Stannis murder Renly.Â 
And he murdered him in the books as well. Whats your point?
Â 
Whereas in the books he's unaware he even did it and has nightmares about it.Â 
And Stannis in the show expresses regret for the death of Renly to. 2 X 10
Â 
Show Stannis begs Mel for sex. Can you see Book Stannis doing the same?Â 
How do you know this doesn't happen? Stannis or Mel do not have a POV together. We have no actual knowledge what takes place between them. Besides the point is moot, they did sleep together in the books as well. I highly doubt Mel forced him.Â 
Â 
Show Stannis goes north because Mel told him to.
Books Stannis goes north because Davos told him to. How does this demonstrate agency?Â 
Â 
Â 
Hell look how they portrayed Renly in comparison to Stannis. Show Renly is a serious, thoughtful, educated person while Book Renly is a douche with entitlement issues. Also they made it seem like he sincerely respected Brienne when Book Renly mocked Brienne behind her back.

Â 


Â 
Actually Stannis never ordered Mel to kill Renly in the books. That was Mel's doing. He's oblivious to what happened.Â 
Â 
And in 2 x 10 he even chokes Melisandre. lol, villain vibes
Â 
We don't but it's not consistent with Book Stannis' character so just use your head.
Â 
Er...no. He doesn't go north because Davos told him to. Davos reads the letter and said the horse and cart speech that resonated with Stannis but it was still all Stannis' choice. He chose to pardon Davos and listen to him.Â 
Â 
Whereas he's just a puppet of Mel in the books who begrudgingly does what Mel tells him to.
Â 
You just quoted a passage that vindicated what I said. Congrats. Yes, we both agree that Book Renly was a douche. Anything else?
Â 
Stannis follows the law. There is no law in Westeros that says subjects must be the same religion as the king.Â 
Â 
He created a condition for those wildlings to bind them to him. If he really cared about conversion he'd be doing the same with the Northerners. His freaking Hand follows the Seven for God's Sake.

Yes, because the show has clearly established where Florent is from, and where those 'lands' are. Say it with me: This isn't the books.Â 
Â 
Also, whose to say what the time frame for all of this is, and what 'idols' Stannis is talking about? It could have been idols he wore on his person, or idols he kept in his quarters, or on his ship - any number of things.Â 
Â 


Stannis, Mel and Renly meet in land.
Melissandre needs Davos to take her to Renly by ship.

Â 
Again, you're the one who seems to have problems with logic. Renly is camped, Stannis and his men are stationed on their ships. They meet on land to parlay, then Stannis returns to his ship with Davos & Melisandre. Since we can see that Mel isn't pregnant during the meet with Renly, we can assume that her and Stannis did the deed, then she was sent with Davos back to shore.Â

Just because she tells Stannis that she can/will 'give him a son' doesn't mean that was the point of conception. That could have been where they formulated the plan to kill Renly, should he not back down and concede to Stannis' authority, or it could have just been a quickie...Â

I think purpose of that scene was to create that shadowbaby. Mel even says that she will give him a son.
3644	Khal-a-bunga	2014-04-16	It could have been, sure, but I don't think it was definitive. I personally felt that it was more about foreshadowing the shadow baby than anything else. Just to give the audience a heads up that some weird shit was about to go down, but in a way that isn't too obvious. Definitely open to interpretation, though.Â
3645	Lord Bronn Stokeworth	2014-04-16	Â 
(1) Yes, because the show has clearly established where Florent is from, and where those 'lands' are. Say it with me: This isn't the books.Â

Â 
1. Unless they directly counter it, I think it's reasonable to say that locations of known Houses are the same. Otherwise, it gets more ridiculous. They change an entire House's location - and the politics of the Reach with the Florents having a better claim than the Tyrells - just to make Stannis more fanatical.
Â 
2. Common sense. He said "tore down" which imply permanent structures. So, not on his person. I'm kinda doubting that he had permanent structures in his quarters or ships.
Â 
D&D do a great job at translating the series from books to pages.... except for Stannis. They're pretty sloppy. Which brings up another WTF point.....
Â 
3. Shireen is Stannis and Selyse's daughter. She is Stannis's only heir. It JUST occurred to them to introduce their daughter to the religion they are burning people alive for not following? Even if Stannis doesn't give a crap about R'Hollor, Selyse does. I mean, seriously?!?!?!
Â 
Oh. I know Shireen's religious beliefs are never brought up in the book. That's fine. She doesn't have much screen time. I would be perfectly happy if she rejected R'Hollor. But I think it's reasonable to believe she has learned about R'Hollor. So, no. I'm not going to buy "well, they didn't show it the books, so anything is possible" argument here either because makes absolutely no sense that they would not bother teaching her even the basics like "how many gods there are in our new religion." Stannis and Selyse probably aren't the most involved parents, but they acknowledge her existence. And let's face it. The child and heir of the man you want to convert would be a high priority target if you were Mel.
3646	Konradsmith	2014-04-17	Well, given what Mel has said so far, it seems that there is actually some utility to making sacrifices, its not just something to do as standard practise. She said that "a great gift requires a great sacrifice." This beach burning may have been another demonstration of power like frying the leeches was. I wouldn't be surprised if inÂ the next episodeÂ someone (bet it Mel, or Stan himself) makes the connection between the sacrifice on the beach and Joffrey dying. Mel called the burning people "tokens of our faith" implying that they were a sort ofÂ payment. Given how her magic seems to work, that means that there will likely beÂ a result.

Â 


Basically, this is the Westerosi version of Dick Cheney's One Percent Doctrine.
It's the specious 'reasoning' that caused the USA to go to war with Iraq, on the argument that;

"We don'tÂ knowÂ that they have WMDs, but if there's even a 1% chance that they might, we have to take them out.
Hair on fire! Hair on fire! Smoking gun in the form of a mushroom cloud!!"
(This is how you 'justify' a pre-emptive invasion of another country under the thin excuse that it's in self defense.)

What's the saying about prophecy being like a treacherous woman who'll bite your cock off?
Melisandre at this particular point in time, post-Blackwater, doesn't exactly have a good track record where interpreting prophecy is concerned.
If Stannis is shown to trust her at this point, it makes him out to be a fool.
Â 
She murdered Renly with Stannis' unwitting assistance so that Stannis would gain Renly's troops.
But he only gained the smaller part of the troops.
The larger force, the Tyrells, didn't remain neutral - they went over to the Lannister side and eventually are who defeats Stannis.
So he was actually WORSE off for having killed Renly.
Â 
As Doctor Phil would as, "How's that workin' for ya?"
I personally wouldn't trust someone who manipulated me into aiding and abetting a murder without even telling me until after the fact. YMMV
Â 
Then she murdered Cortnay Penrose, this time with Stannis' foreknowledge, using the same dark sorcery that was used against Renly. This second murder was committed in part in order to get control over Edric Storm, Stannis' nephew. A boy of 11. Only much later does she reveal her intention to sacrifice him.
Â 
What's that saying about sorcery being a sword without a hilt?
If you can't grasp it without wounding yourself, how can you use it against your enemies?
Â 
If you read Davos I and Davos II of ASoS, he quite indisputably blames Melisandre for leading Stannis down the garden path to his utter defeat at Blackwater.
It kind of begs the question: WHY doesn't Stannis feel the same way? He just accepts it?!?
Why does he still trust her, even to the point of contemplating killing his innocent nephew?
Â 
Your choices here are:Â 
- to accept the fact that Stannis goes along with one dark and dodgy crime after another in his efforts to win the throne,
- or that he has no agency - he's just being manipulated by Melisandre.
Who, incidentally is not shown to have an ounce of remorse over the thousands burned to death because of her failed prophecy.
3648	Ty K	2014-04-17	Jesus Christ!
Â 
The show had Stannis murder Renly.Â 
Â 
Whereas in the books he's unaware he even did it and has nightmares about it.Â 
Â 
As someone else pointed out, he has regrets it in the show as well. One way or another, he was going to kill Renly if he had a chance. 
Â 
It doesn't make sense in the books how he is unaware of the shadow demons anyways so its possible they are correcting Martin's shaky logic here. Seriously, Stannis has dreams from the perspective of the shadow demon. It ages him a decade over night and required him having sex with Melisandre to conjure. He orders Davos to take Melisandre under Storm's End to assassinate Penrose. How is it exactly that Stannis wasn't aware something was going on?
Â 
Show Stannis begs Mel for sex. Can you see Book Stannis doing the same?Â 
Â 
I couldn't see Book Stannis having sex PERIOD and yet we know he does with Melisandre. We have only seen Stannis when Davos, Jon/Sam, and Theon are around him. We don't know what he is like in private. That scene took place right after Blackwater and the book does say he was reclusive and not dealing with almost anyone outside of Mel. Its not outside the realm of possibility.
Â 
Show Stannis goes north because Mel told him to.
Â 
And Show Stannis didn't execute Davos because Mel told him to.Â 
Â 
Show Stannis has no agency of his own. He is a puppet of Mel. It's not hard to see that. You have to take it all in to figure what they're trying to turn Stannis into.
Â 
Yes, Stannis is more reliant on Mel. No doubt. I think it is pretty obvious this is part of an effort to make his upcoming face-turn more dramatic. Whether you like this or not, as long as the end result is the same then its not a big deal. Remember how upset people were when Jaime killed his cousin? Again, done to make the turn more dramatic. Jaime is one of non-readers favorites now it seems so it obviously worked.
Â 
Hell look how they portrayed Renly in comparison to Stannis. Show Renly is a serious, thoughtful, educated person while Book Renly is a douche with entitlement issues. Also they made it seem like he sincerely respected Brienne when Book Renly mocked Brienne behind her back.
Â 
He does clearly become more mature between Season 1 and Season 2 but so what? Its like you StanStans pick and choose what facts to acknowledge and which to ignore. Olenna still says he was a silly boy who was in over his head. He still makes jokes throughout his parley with Stannis. Catelyn points out to him how all he does is play at war and that they are the knights of summer blah blah blah. On the other hand, the show has made changes to Stannis like turning him into a badass at the Battle of the Blackwater or having him seem more protective of his daughter than Book Stannis was that are positive. Why are those ignored?
Â 
And Book Stannis did that to the Wildlings as a show that they were his men now rather than because he actually cares about converting them for religion's sake.
Â 
That is how you rationalize it. I used the same rationale for his actions in the previous episode and you shot it down.
Â 
Jon was sure of that, but he also thought that Mel might try to burn Mance's son. Doesn't mean it's true.
Â 
Doesn't mean its not, either. And Mel did want to burn Mance's son but Jon switched it out with Gilly's before she could.
Â 
These aren't subtle differences. These are huge.
Â 
I don't see why. Again, nothing has been changed so much that it can't be corrected given how they handle this season.

3650	Mithras	2014-04-17	From Mel's POV:

Melisandre had spent the night in her chair by the fire, as she often did. With Stannis gone, her bed saw little use.
3651	aFeastForDragons	2014-04-17	Nobody here forgets the Battle of Blackwater and how Stannis was portrayed as the "Mannis" character a lot of people fictionalise here. Its the way that character was supposed to come back after Davos's paper shield. I always got the idea that when he hears Davos out he comes to his senses and goes into Mannis mode gathering his amy, burning Florent and setting sail for the wall as fast as possible.
Â 
It does really bug me that its always Stannis mentioned. Is nobody as annoyed as I am that Davos's greatest moment was taken from him and made look like it was Mel's idea? Daniel or David has said Davos is one of their favourite characters yet they butchered his paper shield scene. It would be like Qyburn fending off the bear so Jaime could then escape or The Hound finishing off Polliver.
Â

Actually (and this may have been brought up in the few days I haven't posted), I realized the burning of Florent is really fucking stupider than I first thought.

That is a bit of a reach. There is no indication whatsoever that the scene we see where his blindfold is removed was actually the first time he was conscious. The argument is the same as claiming that because we didn't see Jaime and Brienne travel from Harrenhall to KL that it is some kind of inconsistency. Also, Theon crying "Cut it off!" does not actually mean the finger was cut off. Book Theon had some fingers removed and some others were flayed but he still had them. Attempting to condemn the show on those points lacks rationality.
3655	Konradsmith	2014-04-17	^Indeed. If Theon didn't know where he was and hadn't been told yet, he would still ask desperately. I think the implication WAS that he lost his little finger but I didn't expect too much consistency on that front so I'm fine with a glimpse of it here and there.

3656	Lady Meera Reed	2014-04-17	Nobody here forgets the Battle of Blackwater and how Stannis was portrayed as the "Mannis" character a lot of people fictionalise here. Its the way that character was supposed to come back after Davos's paper shield. I always got the idea that when he hears Davos out he comes to his senses and goes into Mannis mode gathering his amy, burning Florent and setting sail for the wall as fast as possible.
Â 
It does really bug me that its always Stannis mentioned. Is nobody as annoyed as I am that Davos's greatest moment was taken from him and made look like it was Mel's idea? Daniel or David has said Davos is one of their favourite characters yet they butchered his paper shield scene. It would be like Qyburn fending off the bear so Jaime could then escape or The Hound finishing off Polliver.
Â -snip-
Â 
That's one of my favorite moment. Davos ready to die, but managing to appeal to Stannis' sense of duty with nothing but a paper shield was a poignant scene (made even greater by the "cart before the horse" speech later).. I was hoping they'd include bits of that convo in the show because it was really moving  "I know that a king protects his people or he is no king at all." I wonder why D&D felt the need to change it. 
I dont expect they'll use any of the great lines by Stannis/Davos/Mel anymore, especially not after this episode.
3657	Spotted Cat	2014-04-17	Really zero redeeming qualities?Â 
Not sure why he has such a large fanbase if he had no redeeming qualities.Â 
Edit: I don't believe in whatever baazigar believes.Â  



im sorry what is a baazigar?Â 
Â 


Â 
When I hear people say someone has zero redeeming qualities it makes me wonder if they even understand the books and their complicated characters.Â 



book stannis is an hypocrite. he is just using the religious fervour of queens men to achieve his own end. You need to be intelligent to do that. show stannis is just a fanatic. do you really think he will resist Mels idea to burn little children ?Â
3658	zaphodbrx	2014-04-17	I've said it before and I'll say it again. I had some hopes for show!Stannis but after the episode 'Mhysa' , I lost all hope. Let's face it, show!Stannis is either a villain and/or a puppet to Melisandre. That's how it is and deal with it. So I don't particularly mind that show!Stannis burns some infidels because I no longer have any expectations of him to begin with. Book!Stannis will always be there for us and it doesn't matter what the show does. ( I have internalized the same for Littlefinger as well . )
3659	Denam_Pavel	2014-04-17	Â 
I assumed Axel has statues to the Seven set up like they had at Dragonstone, something that would be highly visible.
Â 
I don't see why we should assume such.
Â 
The infidel line is getting thrown way out of proportion. What term would people suggest they have used besides infidel, given its the appropriate word for what he is saying? It doesn't even make a substantial difference in his reasoning. Axel was ordered to take up the new religion and he refused. Stannis has the fiery heart of the Lord of Light in his sigil, he is going to make it the official religion when/if he conquers Westeros. Disobeying Stannis on this makes Axel both an infidel and a traitor.
Â 
All I'm saying is, he is being executed for the former, not the latter.Â And if he's executed for both it's his infidelity that Stannis vocally cares about.
Â 
Ned died because Joffrey is an idiot, and that was only after he had been captured and lost all leverage. There was no guarantee burning Axel was going to make the winds pick up either unless you think, gasp, that Book Stannis's faith actually compelled him to kill a man.
Â 
Yes, I do think that, among other reasons. And Shireen was to be sent to King's Landing and stay there and betroth Tommen. What leverage would she have exactly, after Stannis has surrendered and the Florent bannermen have returned to the Reach and Saan sailed away and all that?
Â 
You can rationalize it both ways all day long, which was my point about perceptions, Stannis burnt a man alive at the stake and I don't think it paints him in any worse of a light to have done it for disobeying one type of order than another.
Â 
Well I see a difference between surrendering to the Lannisters on behalf of Stannis and all of Dragonstone and not personally converting to R'hllor.
Â 
None of that has to do with motivation. I meant that Stannis begrudgingly accepting the Lord of Light as opposed to being completely agnostic isn't all that massive of a change.
Â 
I don'tÂ see Stannis as completely agnotic at this point in the books. But in the books he still values bannermen that are loyal to him in every ascept except their faith and even people like Saan and Davos.
Â 
The broad strokes of his uncertainty and pragmatic intentions are still there, they are just playing it a different way. Even then, the things you are mentioning aren't even big changes. They had to stretch Stannis' arc out for pacing reasons. Just because he hasn't went to the Wall yet doesn't mean he isn't going to. We only saw one scene with them and it didn't touch upon what their future plans were in it. That should be next episode after hearing about Joffrey's death.
Â 
He'll probably still go but it probably won't be because he cares about what happens on the Wall. As D&DÂ say in "inside the episode", Stannis is still 100% obsessed with the Iron Throne and his birthright and nothing else even though he's already heard about the White Walkers and all that.

You may invent excuses for why either this scene was not written by Martin in the episodeÂ (although how you'd know that for sure is beyond me) but officially this is his episode and we have seen him write Stannis in the past episodes of the show (Blackwater, in which he's fine with the death of "thousands"). I never felt comfortable with that dictator worship with book-Stannis. We know he never intended Stannis to be as popular as he was and frankly he's just a whiny prick to me in the books, who cares naught for the NW rules to not engage politically.

Are you sure he doesnt want Stannis to be popular?
Even more, he is making the main character of the SOIAF to develop a relationship where he respects the guy, cares for him, helps, and wants him to win.
At the same time Daenerys fights cartoonish enemies that we cant even remember their names.

3664	jons nissa	2014-04-17	Stannis sees a vision with his own eyes, of the Fist of the First Men, and is certain that what Mel is saying about a battle for the Dawn, against a cold that never ends, is true. From that vision he agrees to use the leeches that are already filled with Edric's blood because he was sick and was leeched. The three leeches ending up seeming to perform as required prove that Mel's use of King's Blood indeed has the power she claimed to have.

Â 
again, all stannis has seen proof of is that melisandre can kill.Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 

â<U+0080><U+009C>â<U+0080><U+0094>is one boy! He may be the best boy who ever drew breath and it would not matter. My duty is to the realm.â<U+0080><U+009D> His hand swept across thePainted Table. â<U+0080><U+009C>How many boys dwell in Westeros? How many girls? How many men, how many women? The darkness will devour them all,she says. The night that never ends.Â She talks of prophecies . . . a hero reborn in the sea, living dragons hatched from dead stone . . . shespeaks of signs and swears they point to me. I never asked for this, no more than I asked to be king.Â Yet dare I disregard her?â<U+0080><U+009D>

Â 
if you want to focus on his own words then let's look at them. he clearly has no idea what she's talking about. he's going on her word alone. why wouldn't he? he's being made to be the greatest hero of all time. who wouldn't respond to that?
Â 
Â 

He can't take the chance that she is right and he refuses because to try and prove that it works 100% would potentially risk an innocent. There is simply too much on the line here for playing safe.

Â 
i totally agree and believe i've said as much in my earlier posts. stannis is desperate and melisandre is promising a huge miracle that will seat him on the throne. words and promises, leeches and deaths.

Â 

Stannis rounded on him in a cold fury. "I know his name. Spare me your reproaches. I like this no more than you do, but my duty is to the realm. My duty . . . " He turned back to Melisandre. "You swear there is no other way? Swear it on your life, for I promise, you shall die by inches if you lie."

he is reluctant but he is ready to do it. and that's what i've said. my earlier quote says i'm not clear how so many believe a bit of doubt or even tons and tons of it (which was not the case!) washes away all the ramifications of making a decision like burning someone alive and you've suggested a reread. clearly you didn't understand my confusion. it says that his reluctance doesn't mean he is cleared and absolved of the choice to kill for gain. stannis is indeed facing the classic 1 life versus the world question and how one answers tells what type of person they are. stannis is ready to kill the boy because it will bring him a miracle that will save the realm and give him the throne:
Â 

"You are he who must stand against the Other. The one whose coming was prophesied five thousand years ago. The red comet was your herald. You are the prince that was promised, and if you fail the world fails with you." Melisandre went to him, her red lips parted, her ruby throbbing. "Give me this boy," she whispered, "and I will give you your kingdom."

do you think he believes he's the prince that was promised? he doesn't understand any of this just as he doesn't understand how the leeches killed the kings or how renly and pembrose were killed by a shadow. all he knows is melisandre is claiming to be able to do these things. he is willing to follow her and give her what she wants and doesn't seem to fussed about the fact that he really doesn't understand any of it. Â 
and if we look closer at the vision you say stannis saw, we realize that it is at melisandre's bidding that he looks into the flames and sees what he sees. hmmmmm. if we look at the scene closely we realize it is melisandre's interpretation of this vision that puts the seed of the great battle that needs to be fought vs the squabble for the throne. it made me realize why d&d make it seem like it is at melisandre's suggestion that they go to the wall because it is. she is showing stannis this vision and then interpreting it for him:
Â 

"It is the great battle His Grace is speaking of," said a woman's voice, rich with the accents of the east. Melisandre stood at the door in her red silks and shimmering satins, holding a covered silver dish in her hands. "These little wars are no more than a scuffle of children before what is to come. The one whose name may not be spoken is marshaling his power, Davos Seaworth, a power fell and evil and strong beyond measure. Soon comes the cold, and the night that never ends." She placed the silver dish on the Painted Table. "Unless true men find the courage to fight it. Men whose hearts are fire."
Stannis stared at the silver dish. "She has shown it to me, Lord Davos. In the flames."
"You saw it, sire?" It was not like Stannis Baratheon to lie about such a thing.
"With mine own eyes. After the battle, when I was lost to despair, the Lady Melisandre bid me gaze into the hearthfire. The chimney was drawing strongly, and bits of ash were rising from the fire. I stared at them, feeling half a fool, but she bid me look deeper, and . . . the ashes were white, rising in the updraft, yet all at once it seemed as if they were falling. Snow, I thought. Then the sparks in the air seemed to circle, to become a ring of torches, and I was looking through the fire down on some high hill in a forest. The cinders had become men in black behind the torches, and there were shapes moving through the snow. For all the heat of the fire, I felt a cold so terrible I shivered, and when I did the sight was gone, the fire but a fire once again. But what I saw was real, I'd stake my kingdom on it.""And have," said Melisandre.The conviction in the king's voice frightened Davos to the core. "A hill in a forest . . . shapes in the snow . . . I don't . . . "
"It means that the battle is begun," said Melisandre. "The sand is running through the glass more quickly now, and man's hour on earth is almost done. We must act boldly, or all hope is lost. Westeros must unite beneath her one true king, the prince that was promised, Lord of Dragonstone and chosen of R'hllor."

Â 
this really doesn't paint stannis as the one making the decisions about anything. many consider davos as the morality and conscious of stannis and he is frightened about what he's hearing. the fact is, stannis is seeing this vision when he is at his lowest and broken of spirit at her bidding. sounds like the best time for manipulation. and of course, as readers, we now know that melisandre's visions are a mixed bag however, stannis doesn't. my point is, at this stage of the story she's only delivered magical deaths and has explained to stannis that there is a greater battle that must be fought in the snow and cold by the savior of r'hollor which is him. she is definitely the one calling the shots at this point. but that changes when they get to the wall. she's still up to her old tricks (burning mance) but stannis is finally removed from her influence, which is very, very great.
Â 
it seems d&d are honing in on this scene from the books to explain the relationship between stannis and melisandre on screen and it definitely explains the scene at the end of season 2 when they are staring in the flames and in season 3 when she is the one to confirm what davos says about going to the wall.Â 
Â 
Â 

Â after he knows what Sam wrote in the letter about the Others coming, Stannis is still sitting on his hands on Dragonstone,

yeah, i agree, i don't know why they're sitting around dragonstone at their leisure instead of packing up. no clue what d&d are up to with that. very strange.

Â 
I can only guess it is a an actor's contractual screen-time issue. They can 'get away' with having them appear in every second episode and that is why they are inserting the Braavos scenes - so a Team Dragonstone appearance in Eps 2,4,6,8 and 10, with 6 and 8 in Braavos perhaps?
Â 
It still would have made much more sense for the Ep 2 scene to be about them trying to deal with the issues they are facing due to logistics instead of what they did.

The author has called stannis a righteous man, indicating yes, he does not consider him a villain. In fact, he has even said melisandre is the most misunderstood character. Make if that what you will. 
Furthermore, if the author did not intend for us to like stannis he would not have given Jon and stannis a sort of friendship, he would not have given stannis any of the great lines that he has, nor would he have pitted stannis against the biggest villains in the series(whites, others, boltons, freys)

Certainly, and yet the depth GRRM puts into his characters means that righteousness is not necessarily always a virtue - just as Ned Stark's honour was his downfall. This is set up with the Robert = steel, Stannis = iron, Renly = copper description. Stannis's actions at the Battle of Castle Black demonstrate the power and strength of character that can be drawn from righteousness. His actions on other issues demonstrates where it is a flaw just as iron is flawed and not suitable for all purposes.
3676	Ran	2014-04-17	Spotted Cat,That's the question, isn't it? Stannis is an "ends justify the means" sort of guy. He managed to work his way around killing Edric -- just barely -- with Davos's help, and that's solely because Davos convinces him he should focus on the Great War and not the war for the crown, so he doesn't need to kill Edric now.But then look at how Jon Snow acts: he thinks that if Melisandre convinces Stannis that Aemon's blood, or Aemon Steelsong's blood, would help win the Great War, we're right back to where we were. Stannis would hate it, but in his mind the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, and if push comes to shove he will kill an innocent if he believes it will save many more innocents. He hasn't changed at all, he's simply reconfigured his priorities which makes him "righteous" in a very narrow sense.

use dragon glass or valaryan steel etc. thats how you become righteous. I really doubt he is the AA so even if he burns, no way any dragons would respond.Â
3678	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-04-17	I don't get one thing. Stannis gets blamed for the "crimes" that Melisandre commits but then doesn't get credit for Davos' noble work and good deeds. He is the one who has decided to surround himself with a person who gives him the hard truth, unlike Dany and many other Kings, who surrounded themselves with yes-men.Â

Well that's one PoV.Â 
Here are two contrasting PoV's:
One from Stannis himself:Clayton Suggs - "A sacrifice will prove our faith still burns true, Sire."Godry the Giantslayer - "The old gods of the north have sent this storm upon us. Only R'hllor can end it. We must give him an unbeliever."Stannis - "Half my army is made up of unbelievers. I will have no burnings. Pray harder.
One from whom some people think controls Stannis:In truth, the young lord commanderÂ and her king had more in common than either one would ever be willing to admit. Stannis had been a younger son living in the shadow of his elder brother, just as Jon Snow, bastard-born, had always been eclipsed by his trueborn sibling, the fallen hero men had called the Young Wolf. Both men were unbelievers by nature, mistrustful, suspicious. The only gods they truly worshipped were honor and duty.
Â
3682	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-04-17	AA legend still is about the end justifiy mean after all... Thats the point of Nissa Nissa.
Every main character has this logic anyway. Qhorin when he makes men stand to let other scape, Jon when he kills Qhorin, sends explorers that wont come back, etc..... Allmost every single character does this one way or the other. Is there a big difference between this and sending your infantery as bait to Tywin in a battle they cant win? 
It is still not right, but this is not what differences Stannis to other characters. Because in that way all of them are "assholes".
Stannis might be one of the few (Bran, Jon)  who uses the end justify means logic for righteous ends, and not just for themselves, family or whatever as  everybody else  does. This is what makes Stannis different. Not being an asshole.
Problem is D&D are only giving us whitewashed characters or villians. Since besides Jaime all the "grey" characters were screwed.
 So where you put Stan?

3683	The Drunkard	2014-04-17	ok this is something i really dont understand.Â 
the "waking of dragons" , why didnt Mel just wake her bloody dragons with renlys blood?


Â 
I imagine sacrifices require blood from a live person, or at least that's what she believes. There would be no reason not to give Edric a quick, painless death otherwise.
Â 


jon was also so afraid for dalla's child that he switched it for gilly's. grrm is showing that not much has changed even if stannis has chosen to fight the fight of the north rather than just the fight for the throne.


Â 
Stannis had ample time to burn any of the KB hosts at the Wall, or even seize them for future use. He didn't. Jon fearing it doesn't make it true, especially when these fears are based on rumours and the words of feverish queen's men, who, mind you, seem to think Stannis will burn any KB host he gets his hand on.
Â 
Ran, do you know why it is that Show Stannis hasn't left for the Wall? The books gave a sense of immediacy that doesn't seem to be there on the show, even though you'd expect the show to be speedier given the letter was about the immediate threat of the Others rather than the wildlings.

3685	jons nissa	2014-04-17	One from whom some people think controls Stannis:
In truth, the young lord commanderÂ and her king had more in common than either one would ever be willing to admit. Stannis had been a younger son living in the shadow of his elder brother, just as Jon Snow, bastard-born, had always been eclipsed by his trueborn sibling, the fallen hero men had called the Young Wolf.Â Both men were unbelievers by nature, mistrustful, suspicious. The only gods they truly worshipped were honor and duty.

Â 
and she begins her quote with:Â 
Â He does not love me, will never love me, but he will make use of me. Well and good. Melisandre had danced the same dance with Stannis Baratheon, back in the beginning.
Â 
no one says stannis has taken r'hollor into his heart but he has bet the farm on melisandre, understandably, and is willing to talk the talk and walk the walk, until the bitter end, regardless of what she asks of him. mel understands that and jon understood it as well. and just as mel produces "miracles" to convince stannis, she tried to do the same with jon.

Jon fearing it doesn't make it true, especially when these fears are based on rumours and the words of feverish queen's men, who, mind you, seem to think Stannis will burn any KB host he gets his hand on.


Â 
the point is jon believed it was enough of threat to act proactively, not that it was already on stannis' to do list.

Oh yes, sorry. I agree with that.
3687	Ran	2014-04-17	As people are aware of some of the plot lines this season, I'll just say it:
	Spoiler Stannis basically has nothing left on the show. Sallador Saan leaving last season leaves him lacking in ships, he barely has troops, etc. He needs gold with which to buy these things. I admit to not being strictly sure when they will make it plain that he means to use this to go north -- it's not actually obvious in the next episode -- but we know that somehow that will happen, so I suppose it will be explained when he visits the Iron Bank.

1. Unless they directly counter it, I think it's reasonable to say that locations of known Houses are the same. Otherwise, it gets more ridiculous. They change an entire House's location - and the politics of the Reach with the Florents having a better claim than the Tyrells - just to make Stannis more fanatical.
Â 
What do the politics of the Reach, and the relationship between the Florent's and the Tyrell's have to do with the story line of the show? Nothing. That kind of tertiary information is totally irrelevant. I personally view it as the opposite: Unless the writers of the show make it explicit, it's something that can be viewed as more nebulous and malleable to their particular story-telling needs.Â 
Â 
2. Common sense. He said "tore down" which imply permanent structures. So, not on his person. I'm kinda doubting that he had permanent structures in his quarters or ships.
Â 
Fair enough. Stannis tells Davos that he asked him to 'tear down' his idols, and since Stannis isn't one to mince words, we'll just go ahead and assume that House Florent is in the same location as the books and that he had large idols to the Seven that Stannis ordered to be taken down. There's still no issue of logic here, since the timeline here isn't specified. Perhaps he ordered Axell to tear down his idols two weeks ago, and Selyse confirmed to Stannis that he had not done so. Doesn't strike me as something that took place over the course of an afternoon.Â 
Â 
D&D do a great job at translating the series from books to pages.... except for Stannis. They're pretty sloppy. Which brings up another WTF point.....
Â 
I don't have a problem with how Stannis has been adapted, but then again, I was never huge on the guy until the latter parts ofÂ ASoS, anyway. My argument here isn't about the subjective quality of these scenes, but rather about the fact that there isn't any inconsistency created - within the world of the show - through these scenes.
Â 
3. Shireen is Stannis and Selyse's daughter. She is Stannis's only heir. It JUST occurred to them to introduce their daughter to the religion they are burning people alive for not following? Even if Stannis doesn't give a crap about R'Hollor, Selyse does. I mean, seriously?!?!?!
Â 
Selyse doesn't seem to care much for Shireen (based on the two scenes we've seen with Selyse talking about her); Stannis seems to care very deeply about her (given their two scenes together, as well). Since Stannis seems more interested in the power of R'Hollor, and much less so in the ideology of this religion, it doesn't strike me as unusual that she wouldn't have been 'converted', or that this wouldn't even have been attempted. Again, if we just use the information provided in the show: Stannis barely sees Shireen, and is almost always in the company of Melisandre, whom he couldn't have met before leaving King's Landing (otherwise it's likely that Renly would have known about her). So there's no real inconsistency here, either, and I'm not sure I see the problem with this at all. Perhaps Selyse had tried to talk to her about it, but consider she's "sullen and stubborn"...
Â 
Oh. I know Shireen's religious beliefs are never brought up in the book. That's fine. She doesn't have much screen time. I would be perfectly happy if she rejected R'Hollor. But I think it's reasonable to believe she has learned about R'Hollor. So, no. I'm not going to buy "well, they didn't show it the books, so anything is possible" argument here either because makes absolutely no sense that they would not bother teaching her even the basics like "how many gods there are in our new religion." Stannis and Selyse probably aren't the most involved parents, but they acknowledge her existence. And let's face it. The child and heir of the man you want to convert would be a high priority target if you were Mel.
Â 
None of my arguments revolve around the idea that 'if it didn't happen in the books, anything is possible'. I try to separate the show and the novels, and allow for the fact that each telling of this story will have its own canon, so to speak. I can use my knowledge of the books to provide further background details, or to enhance my enjoyment of the show, but I make it a point not to get the two mixed up. It's when you try to square the books and the show on a 1:1 comparison where these issues of "logic" come up for some people.Â

3694	Lord Varys	2014-04-17	Ran,
Â 
from what we have learned from episode 3 
	Spoiler Davos (and Shireen) are trying to convince Stannis to use money from the Iron Bank to hire the Golden Company. The interesting thing now is: will that fail (because the Golden Company refuses/is unreachable) or will they just go along with it, canceling the whole Aegon plot line... I'd think (and root for) the former, of course. It would be a nice way to conclude Stannis' story pre-Wall at Braavos during the negotiations with the Iron Bank, giving the impression that they won't loan anything to Stannis (or that he is not able to transform the coin into a huge army). Then they could have him appear at the Wall with 1,000 or so sellswords he was able to hire in Braavos.
Â 
With Olenna and Tywin discussing the Iron Bank in episode 2 it's also possible that Tywin will choose to ignore the demands of the Iron Bank in the wake of Joffrey's death because he preoccupied with the trial against Tyrion, Jaime's stubbornness, Cersei's increasingly erratic behavior, Oberyn's demands, and - most likely - Shae, leading to the Iron Bank's decision to back Stannis' claim in episode 6 or 7.
3695	Konradsmith	2014-04-17	From what I read Lord Varys (and Ran confirm this if youÂ want to) 
	Spoiler  Davos brings up the Golden Company to Stannis in the scene where both are talking and Stannis is against the idea of using sellswords. I think he does convince him about it but then the fact is they need gold. In a later scene when Davos is reading with Shireen again she mentions the Iron Bank casually or off-topic and a lighbulb dings above his head. 

Â 
The reasonÂ  they've not mentioned the Wall is to create an ambiguity or uncertainty about how the Battle of the Wall will end. Maybe they'll play up the weakness of KL and have Team Dragonstone reconsider another attack there or something to misdirect us. They want his arrival to be more surprising and also to give them something to do before they show up. Naturally they had to go outside of book canon for material.

					
					
							Edited by Konradsmith, 17 April 2014 - 01:22 PM.
3696	Lord Varys	2014-04-17	The weakness angle in KL should really come up. Stannis will learn about Joff's death and Tyrion's arrest soon enough. They might decide that this is the opportune time to mount another attack, and they could hint that they are finally going to Braavos 
	Spoiler to get money to hire the Golden Company to attack KL - the Golden Company would most likely not be eager to travel to the Wall, even if they were offered a lot of gold - only to find that they can't hire the GC. Then Stannis suddenly pops up at the Wall and proves Jon's point that discipline always beats numbers... I'm pretty sure that the name-dropping of the Golden Company is all but a confirmation that we'll see Aegon and Connington next season. They only mention stuff if it's going to become important...
3697	Khal-a-bunga	2014-04-17	Or maybe the Iron Bank will proposition Stannis to attack King's Landing...? Would make sense, considering Tyrion has already mentioned how the Iron Bank would fund the enemies of the throne should the various loans default. Maybe the scene with Tycho will be framed in such a way that it ends ambiguously, and we don't know which path Stannis will choose (until he shows up at the Wall, of course).Â
3698	Konradsmith	2014-04-17	^I think they'll go that route. We'll get Stan next episode, maybe in four or five, then ep. six and not again until they save the day in ep. nine.

Â 
Yes i agree with this... they have to make the audience forget about the end of last season with the talk of the Wall, and the flame vision of a battle in the snow in S2. i was wondering how they would pad it out, with an obligation of keeping the DS characters on the screen for a while.
Â 
And agreed with the other post, it does seem they'll have to take our eye off Stannis for just a few episodes to make the arrival pack a punch. It's a difficult balancing act, but they usually deliver the great moments very well.
3700	Konradsmith	2014-04-17	And to all of you StanStans, maybe they'll play the King's Arrival theme as he rides in. Wouldn't you all just love that!
Â 
Off topic but yolkboy, I love your theories, and I complimented you earlier on wicnet. Sadly though, I have to inform you that Marge didn't do the poisoning because Natalie Dormer says in the "anatomy of a scene" feature that Marge was genuinely surprised by Joff choking. Also in the preview for the next episode she badgers Olenna as if she hadn't been in the know.

3703	Thelastactionhero	2014-04-17	You know, I rewatched the episode a third time today. I'm still not pleased with it, and I don't think that our frustration at the textual deviations is unwarranted, but I've just decided I'm not going to be angry about it anymore. It's pointless, since we can't change the direction they're taking him, and it's effecting my ability to enjoy the show as a whole. The acting is still pretty fucking good, and I don't think they'd be playing up his concern for Shireen so much if their plan was to strip him of all the character traits fans of the character love. The fact is that some of these scenes with Davos look promising, and I'm excited to see their interactions. The Book!Stannis ship has sailed guys. The chips fell, and not in our favor. I'll say this though, Stephen Dillane's acting might be enough to give us some of what want, so long as we get at least a partial redemption arc (which I think we almost have to, because of how substantial his actions at the Wall are).
Â 
I don't think D&D appreciate the nuance of his character the way us book readers do, but whatever. We can still vent our frustrations and all that shit, and I'm not going to make apologies for how much has been lost in the character, but sometimes I think we need to remember that in the grand scheme of adaptations, Stannis hasn't turned out nearly as bad as some others. Think about Denethor in Lord of the Rings. Now that was a case where every redeeming quality a character had was stripped away so that the films could have a cookie cutter antagonist. Let's wait and see how this season goes and try to enjoy the show for what it is. If he starts murdering innocent wildling children and condoning rape though, you can expect to see me on the front lines with my pitchfork.

3704	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-17	I read t hat the word "infidel" really got people mad. I understand that. But... it wouldn't the first time that Stannis says something in order to convince HIMSELF that what he's doing is right. Like the whole "I have to kill my nephew for the greater good!" while he kept delaying the burning and inside, he was practically grateful that Davos saved the kid.
Â 
While Stannis is not a religious believing person, this follows a pattern that we saw start after Blackwater. He lost and got desperate. Then, Melisandre offered another option, killing three of his enemies. One is already dead and he's about to find out a second one is gone. If we recall the tale of proudwing, he's simply reminding that this God is effective but he's also saying he doesn't like it. What else could he do?
3705	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-17	They may not do it at the charge due to the logistics or whatnot... but if it is done at the moment of victory by the troops as they surround Stannis, then I will be very happy.
3706	Benjaario Starkharis	2014-04-18	I don't like what they are doing with Stannis, but I recently watched the latest "Inside the Episode" video, where D&D discuss how Stannis is obsessed with his birthright. At first that made me mad, because they were apparently trying to make him like another power mad tyrant, however, after giving it some thought, I think they are setting him up for his famous line of Davos reminding him of his duties when all he could think was his birthrights. I think they are making him darker and more unlikeable to make his character development deeper, from a douche claimant to a tyrant warlord to a badass king. I hope I'm not fooling myself, but I believe that by the end of this season we are getting the Mannis back.
3707	Konradsmith	2014-04-18	The Stan and Dave conversation next episode looks promising. And remember that the summary for episode six says "Stannis and Davos set sail", so either without Mel or with her butÂ presence is less important than Dave's. I think they'll have Davey speak some more "hard truths" and Stan scowl and brood and reveal more hidden depths. A la their scene in ep 205.

Since Melisandre was the one that convinced Stannis to go to the Wall and to let Davos live the writers might be trying to make up for it by making Davos convince Stannis to go to Braavos.
3709	Konradsmith	2014-04-18	Well Davos said in episode 310 that he is the one who can help bring men to his cause. The route they're going with is that Stannis can't leave for the Wall yet because he doesn't have the means to. So it'll be all about finding their footing and picking up the pieces etc. Dave's point next episode will be, all this religious stuff isn't actually getting any of us anywhere, we need to act.

I know this is a tiny thing, but I got annoyed that no one in KL (namely Cersie) said they wouldnt get raped if Stannis came on the scene, its that kind of thing that makes me worry that "justice law and duty" Stannis, which is where his bad and redeeming qualities come from, since he knows burnings give power but only burns those on death row, is being sacrificed for religious lapdog Stannis, who has no redeeming qualities, he'll probably be a Janos Slynt advocate.
Â 
To those that say "whats the difference between lawful and religious burnings?" What the fuck? We want Stannis controversial, but we want OUR rapist gelding, overly lawful controversial Stannis.

Oh wawawah exceptions to the rule. I see this all the time, like with the spared Stormlords, Davos should've hanged by law as well,. So it turns out that book Stannis is more like to spare a man of use out of mercy than burn him for a petty crime... Get why we're annoyed yet?

But the TV Stannis obviously shows compassion for his daughter, which is not visible in the books.
Â 
He is an ends justify the means guy as stated upthread. He is constantly being denied of his goal so each time he is being seduced to new lows (in terms of atrocities). Any one can see where this path is leading.
Â 
In my world view, ends justify the means guys are the ultimate evils. That is why I admire Ned of not spilling the blood of the children although it costed his head.

While Stannis is not a religious believing person, this follows a pattern that we saw start after Blackwater. He lost and got desperate. Then, Melisandre offered another option, killing three of his enemies. One is already dead and he's about to find out a second one is gone. If we recall the tale of proudwing, he's simply reminding that this God is effective but he's also saying he doesn't like it. What else could he do?


Â 
I am a Stannis fan but upon repeated viewings I get fewer problems with his characterization.
Â 
The way he said "infidel" was so insincere that it was obvious he doesn't approve of it. Really like though what they're doing with Shireen on the show. Best change by far.

3722	HairGrowsBack	2014-04-18	Just dropping it here but I think the supposed "character assassination" of Stannis is really blown out of proportion. Show Stannis is at worst, more whipped (regarding Mel) than in the books, but it's Stannis still. In 4x02, he clearly disapproves the burnings ; sure, the writers probably should'veÂ have him refusing, but as I said, yes, he relies much more on Mel in the show, which kind of sucks, but isn't the only thing that matters : in the episode we also get to see how resilient he is and how, in his own lobstery way, he cares about his family.
The show has had its slips when it comes to Stannis, but they haven't come near to butcher him; hell, if anything, the show has made me like him even more, though that's mostly because Stephen Dillane just nails the part.

Â 
I agree partly with this. I think the main problem is not that he seems to be more depended on Mel, but thatÂ sheÂ is depicted as more malicious in a sense, which reflects more badly on him.
3724	Bronn Urgundy	2014-04-18	Â 
But the TV Stannis obviously shows compassion for his daughter, which is not visible in the books.
Â 
He is an ends justify the means guy as stated upthread. He is constantly being denied of his goal so each time he is being seduced to new lows (in terms of atrocities). Any one can see where this path is leading.
Â 
In my world view, ends justify the means guys are the ultimate evils. That is why I admire Ned of not spilling the blood of the children although it costed his head.


Â 
I dont disagree, part of why I like Stannis is his darkness, but even in a war for all humanity his own moral fibre and iron sense of justice keeps him from those atrocities. Book Stannis = no attack on Claw Isle, never actually consents to Edric (his reasoning is much more sympathetic as well) and punishes crime in his own ranks. Show Stannis = meh, infidel burn! Again, controversial (book Stannis has his own controversies) but for the wrong reasons.Â Some of usÂ can root for a man who fights for justice and give his actions context (I like him, you dont, neither of us are wrong) but a man who burns purely for religion or anti Mel sentiments (S3. Book Stannis people can speak their mind) is irredeemable. ThatÂ justice is gone, transplanted to another character. He's a cunt purely for the sake of it.

I see what you mean, but she doesn't come across as malicious or evil at all to me, merely pragmatic (okay, there was this scene with Gendry, but they needed to show off some boobs, I guess) : she does what she believes is the right thing without much remorse, but she doesn't take much pleasure from it.

The show seems to flip flop a bit though. In some scenes she seems sincere, calm, confident, albeit a bit naive, in others she's just arrogant and purposely spiteful.
Â So my opinion of her in the show can actually change from episode to episode.
Â 
Edit: I meant more malicious than her book counterpart, where's she more mysterious in the same vein as Moqorro.

Melisandre had spent the night in her chair by the fire, as she often did. With Stannis gone, her bed saw little use.

Here is your overly lawful Stannis. Constantly cheating his wife....


You sure about that?
Â 
Yes, we know he's sleeping with Mel, but it's only cheating on his wife if Seylse doesn't know about it and support it.Â 
Â 
And knowing Seylse she probably allows it seeing as she worships Mel and R'hllor.
Â 
Also there are hints that Mel might be drugging Stannis in order to inspire lust. Although I hope she isn't.Â

3734	Guard of the Rainking	2014-04-18	OFF TOPIC The episode 2 recap shows Stanny burning leeches. Could we finally see Balon's death? Personally I thought that it would be fitting if he died in episode 7 because it's named "Mockingbird" since Euron is called the Crow's Eye and is fond of mockery.
3735	Van West	2014-04-18	Mockingbird is Littlefinger's sigil so unlikely.Â

Well, if they're holding it back for later in the season, it would seem to indicate that they plan on introducing Euron and/or Victarion (I think Aeron's a goner), and want the fact that the Iron Islands has lot its king 'fresh' in the mind of the audience (being a relative term, since they wouldn't be introduced until the fifth season).Â 
Â 
And since I can't come up with any good reason to delay it beyond that, I'd assume that they're simply re-organizing events in order to better accommodate the narrative of a ten episode, serialized television show.Â

Someone was tossing the idea that they havent killed off Balon yet because then that wouldve made Mel's magic seem too real, and given that they wanted Joffs death to be a "shocker" it kinda might give it away.

Hints. But doesn't mean it's true. Also Davos and Jon don't generally hang around with Mel all that much like Stannis does.
Â 
And Mel mentions having potions that inspire lust in men in her one chapter.
Â 
(Note: I always figured Renly, Robert and Stannis were homosexual, heterosexual and asexual respectively.)

Cheating isnt illegal, merely immoral. He cant punish people for crimes when they arent crimes, hence our outrage at show Stannis' burnings.
3743	The Onion Sleight	2014-04-19	Or maybe the Iron Bank will proposition Stannis to attack King's Landing...? Would make sense, considering Tyrion has already mentioned how the Iron Bank would fund the enemies of the throne should the various loans default. Maybe the scene with Tycho will be framed in such a way that it ends ambiguously, and we don't know which path Stannis will choose (until he shows up at the Wall, of course).Â 


Â 
I find this idea very appealing. If we'll see such a "KL or Wall? How will he decide?" scene, I'm expecting:
Â 
1. his arrival will be a wonderful great surprise for the Unsullied, much more greater than I assumed after ep. 3.10.
Â 
2. we'll hear his "... he reminded me of my duty, when all I could think of was my rights. I had the cart before the horse, Davos said..." speech to Jon.
"Attackting KL or saving the Wall?" would be such an exactly "Trying to win the throne to save the kingdom VS. trying to save the kingdom to win the throne" situation, it would fit perfectly together!

Fuck, this is getting my excited but I'm afraid to get my hopes up because I don't want to get disappointed again. lol. The more I think about how they've developed Jaime's character after the murder of his cousin, the more I think maybe Stannis isn't too far gone to be salvaged by his scenes up north, provided they don't change the context of events in such a way that portray him in a completely evil light. I'm worried about this rumor that Mance and Jon might reach an amicable agreement just when Stannis shows up and ruins everything, possibly even slaughtering lots of innocent wildings while the Nightwatch kills the cannibals. I'm going to reserve judgment until we reach the end of this season though. A lot of us give a more generous reading for his earlier character arcs specifically because he develops into such a badass when he goes up north, so who knows. Even though none of us Stan fans are pleased with the changes, a part of me is hopeful that maybe the anti-hero we all want to see might actually make his debut at the end of this season.

3747	Dustdevil	2014-04-20	From the behind the scenes commentary of D&D on the episode it looks as if they are still going with the Stannis the Fanatic image, which really frustrates me. I really hope that they are going to make him more badass and make his arc similar to that of Jaime as in going from unsympathetic to more sympathetic. But my hopes are almost gone.

Leaving it ambiguous would be really awesome and would add to the surprise when he appears at the wall and all you hear is STANNIS! STANNIS! STANNIS!

yah! but thats mostly cuz they didnt cast enough "baddies" technically the Magnar did die before Stannis arrived at the Wall, and of course theyre gonna have Jon off him off, you know
Â 
We gotta just hope for a baddass "coming of the Mannis" during the jonmance parlay
3752	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-04-20	But you know Stannis need not needed to kill bad guys to start his redemption, in the books. In the show he is pushed as a full-fledged fanatic by D&D's imagination. So they will have to pull of something like him killing very bad guys to redeem himself. But that's not happening now.Â
3753	The Drunkard	2014-04-20	I think the very fact that these 'bad' sort of wildlings exist, that they aren't all Ygrittes and Tormunds, is enough to make the charge seem heroic, and with Jon hyping up Mance to the NW all throughout the season, as well as Mole's Town getting destroyed, I'd be surprised if they made the charge look bad.
Â 
Especially if they have the cart before the horse conversation in Braavos, but who knows if they'd do something like that.
3754	The Abominable SnowOther	2014-04-20	hmmm, well, they kinda portray Mance as a neither, good or bad, so maybe he offs him(people are tossing the idea around that they might cancel the fArya plotline, i doubt it though) but even if he did he wold just burn him probably. Back to square one...

							Edited by SnowOther, 20 April 2014 - 12:41 AM.
3755	Dustdevil	2014-04-20	Yeah but still think about it guys: Would Mance make a truce with Jon even though Jon already betrayed him before? Also if the NW manages to fend off all of the Wildling attacks why would Maester Aemon have bothered sending out letters to all the Kings of Westeros for help? My guess is it's going to play out like this: The NW manages to defeat the southern attack of the Wildlings but with heavy losses (Thorne and countless others). They hold their ground against the giants and the attacks of the Wildings coming from the North through the gate but lose even more (Grenn). Eventually they don't have a choice but to surrender to Mance. Jon, as acting commander, goes to parlay with Mance but he refuses, saying that he could easily crush them and take the wall, why stop now?
And in that moment: Stannis! Stannis! Stannis!
Â 
I also hope we see Melisandre burning Orell's eagle too.
Â 
Edit: I guess my point is: we don't need Stannis killing baddies to start his redemption arc. All the audience needs is for him to save some of their favorite characters from certain death (Jon, Sam, Maester Aemon) after their other favorite characters have died (Grenn).Â

Yeah cause I totally argued that this rumor was gospel truth? To be frank with you though, it's the sort of dickish thing I could actually see the show runners doing because of how poorly they'ved handled Stannis' character at this point in the series. They've changed the context of other events in his character arc in a way that makes him look a good deal more evil than he is in the books, so why not his moment at the Wall too?

					
					
							Edited by Thelastactionhero, 20 April 2014 - 07:18 AM.
3763	Rashtibram	2014-04-20	Yeah, I'm late to the discussion, but all this talk of "Show-Stannis is a villain" seems to me to be ultimately unfounded. He hasn't been portrayed as a villain at all: Melisandre has, and Stannis has been shown to be more in her thrall than he was at this point in the books. The portrayal has been marginally different, and it might undoubtedly be a bad decision on D&D's part to focus more on Mel than on Stannis and Davos, but a "redemption" arc is in no way impossible at this point. Stannis is ultimately a "good guy" with some morally questionable traits, in the show as well as the books, and I think his scenes in 4x02 illustrated that well ("I hate a good many things, but I suffer them all the same").
Â 
My Unsullied friends generally dislike Stannis, but it's not because they think he's a villain or a monster: they say his personality rubs them the wrong way, and to be honest his personality is one thing the show has adapted very faithfully.
3764	Mithras	2014-04-20	It'll be Thorne, I'm fairly sure.


Â 
I was thinking that they might skip Bowen and continue with Thorne as the main antagonist of Jon. It is true that after Jon beheaded Slynt, Thorne backed down and all the whining was left to Bowen. Still, while Thorne was going to his last ranging, I felt like he will return and cause more trouble.

Axell Florent is still alive in the books but Stannis burned him last Episode.

Â 
I really hope Thorne stays alive  , he's so good on the show!
Â 
Â 
I don't think he (Stannis) has to kill all the baddies to start redeeming.
Showing his motivations and giving us our dutiful Book!Stannis would be much nicer (I'd prefer more dialogues over too many killing scenes).
I think, Jon'll have his "The Wall is yours, Jon Snow!" moment like Tyrion had his "soldiers cyring "Halfman! Halfman!"" moment in "Blackwater" and Stannis'll have an amazing deus-ex-machina-like (postive!) moment like Tywin had in the same episode (remember: Cersei was ready to poison Tommen and herself, but in the last moment her father shows up, rides self-confidently in the throne room, Loras doffs his helmet [so we understand suddenly, ah okay, these fighing guys are Tyrell army], Tywin says, they've won, he saves the day, Cerseiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s happy, epic "Rains of Castamere" music).
I'm hoping, we'll see Stan saving the day, riding self-confidently and badass-stylish to the NW, surprising them with his presence, saying some epic sentence after the battle's won, incredible-awesome music theme (extra for him and this episode).
I'm not giving up hope yet about Ep. 9, and yeah, there're still 6 episodes before 4.09.
*still trying to raise my and our all hopes*
So, I want to come back to earlier events and Braavos for a moment:
I always throught they would create ambiguilty by showing the Iron Bank rejects Stannis' and Davos' request for a loan (because Tywin's still alive, the Crown's still paying their debts) and we would leave them in Ep. 6 or 7 with a scene of "We haven't enough people to help, we're would risk an immense default and maybe losing our last remaining men." and then the Unsullied wouldn't know if they're giving up their idea (no gold -> no sellswords and soldiers -> very small army compared to Mance's; the threat of the Others is in the background, other fights seem more important) or not.
But now, I'm thinking, that we'll maybe see the IBoB more keen of Stannis and his cause and they'll maybe extends a warmer welcome to him than everybodyâ<U+0080><U+0099>d assume, because of all this talking about the Crown's problems with the Bank, Tywin's and Olenna's chat last episode and that they'll maybe refuse their paying earlier than expected.
Then the IBoB would be more pro-Stan much earlier than in the books and it'd be interesting to see how that would effect him and his fate. 
(Even in the books yet, we don't really know how the bank's support will effect the TWOW events and what will really happen after the Theon sample). That'd create an "Iron Bank propostions him to attack KL again" situation (I tkink they'd be more supportive ofÂ  this idea than the Wall idea) and a better scenario.
Not only, because we'd have the ambiguilty, too - the Unsullied might see him thoughtful, struggling / doubtful, conflicted because of "Trying to win the throne to save the kingdom vs. Trying to save the kingdom to win the throne" (as I said before), and not only because of military weakness / less gold, men... .
Want do you think? Will they (Tycho & Co.) just say "Nah, sorry, we still have the Crown, we won't support you" or could it be that they'll more "Well, the Crown is not willing to pay, so we turn to you... Hey, do you still want to take the city?..."? (Even with their money for sellswords & stuff, it'd still be a very risky attack, for the NW would come very help too late, he wouldn't become "the King who still cares", aso... So going to the Wall would be the best decision, but people'd have to wait to Ep. 9 to see the result of his decision ;-)

Â 
Â 

Â 
Another small question, btw: Do you think Davos will go together with the others to Castle Black before his Manderly-mission?
I know it's actually a pretty unnecessary detour sailing to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, then riding to Castle Black, then (in Season 5) riding back to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea and travelling to White Habor (with an unplanned stopover at Sweet Sister), but I could imagine this change on show (I mean, if Stannis has this idea with White Habor later than in the books?).
Because I'd love to see Stan giving this mission to Davos on-screen and maybe a Davos / Jon meeting

3768	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-04-20	Yeah cause I totally argued that this rumor was gospel truth? To be frank with you though, it's the sort of dickish thing I could actually see the show runners doing because of how poorly they'ved handled Stannis' character at this point in the series. They've changed the context of other events in his character arc in a way that makes him look a good deal more evil than he is in the books, so why not his moment at the Wall too?if the rumor comes from my earlier post in this thread, it has no basis. it was just a guess of the kind of stuff D&D are likely to do in their Anti Stannis campaign.
I have no inside info whatsoever.
PD: Im confused with Thorne....I feel they gave him the Noye stuff to cut characters so I dont know what to expect from him.

I originally stumbled across the rumor on reddit. I doubt it has validity, but all this talk regarding how the rest of season 4 is going to go is just speculation and conjecture anyway. On another note though, Thorne is definitely going to bite it. I actually think Tormund will likely stick around though, unless they're planning on heavily simplifying that Wildling arc in A Dance With Dragons.

3770	Khal-a-bunga	2014-04-20	I'm torn on whether or not Thorne is going to die, actually. There had been ideas thrown about that he would take Donal Noye's place, and die fighting a giant, but based on the trailers and footage that we've seen of that sequence thus far, it looks like Grenn will fill that role. We've also seen footage of Thorne fighting with Tormund, but I'm not convinced that this means one of themÂ mustÂ die - any number of things could happen that would allow them both to walk away from that fight.Â 
Â 
Hard to say, really. If Thorne begins to take a more positive approach to Jon as the season develops, then I'd definitely assume that he's a goner. If they remain antagonistic with one another, I think his chances of survival are increased dramatically. Tormund will likely live, either way. With Ygritte out of the picture, he's the most developed wildling left in the cast, and that will be important in the coming fifth season (and beyond, most likely).Â

I pretty much agree with most of this. I'm actually kind of pulling for Thorne to be further developed into that Donal Noye role because his previous antagonisms with Jon would make that arc a bit more interesting, and his heroic death even more surprising. Could actually create some interesting parallels with Show!Stannis if they choose to give him that redemption arc a lot of us are banking on. The more I think about how they've developed these two characters, the more I like the idea of these two men, portrayed as selfish dickheads for the majority of the series, showing their merit by doing their duty when it really counts. The real problem it creates, as others have suggested, is that if Thorne dies, how do we get Jon to Mance for the parley? The idea of Slynt filling that role is shitty, because it seems odd that he'd have that kind of authority after joining the Watch so recently. While it's totally possible that both Thorne and Tormund could walk away from the fight, I kind of feel like the emotional impact of that encounter will be undone if one, or both of the combatants don't perish. Be really interesting for Jon to find Thorne mortally wounded after the duel for one last interesting dialogue to bring their feud to its conclusion. This is actually one of the few times where I like that they're straying from book fidelity, because it's nice to have some surprises in store for us readers.
3772	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-04-20	New Stannis discussion here for the episode 3.Â http://asoiaf.wester...iew-of-stannis/
3773	Kaspiro	2014-04-13	Episode 402 had a few major deviations from the books. Personally, I really liked the War of the Five Kings with dwarves adaptation rather than the dwarf jesters. Much funnier, and it suits the televised adaptation of Joffrey perfectly.Â

Hinting at Olenna poisoning the cup (or it was Margaery poisoning the pie?).. just like the book (I was expecting some hints to Oberyn being the poisoner).

Olenna shutting Mace: "I'm talking with Tywin!!".
Â 
Bran's vision of dragons over a pre-winter KL and an abandoned Iron Throne covered with snow. Things that may never happen, as at the end of ADWD is already snowing in KL and all known dragons are half a world away.
Â 
I have a bad feeling about Show-Vargo and Team Shaggy-dog .

I liked Fat Walda, I disliked Ramsey's Princess Merida, and Roose not saying 'Don't make me rue the day I raped your mother'.

3778	The Killer Snark	2014-04-14	The shaving scene between Theon and Ramsay, though I reckon Theon would most likely have killed him. He's not yet as broken as he is later on. Roose is more judgemental in the series towards Ramsay than he is in the novels. The Dreadfort deviations work better in the series, however, than the deviations elsewhere.

3779	The Last Reyne	2014-04-14	I have to vote for Oberyn vs the Lannisters. He has a wonderful menace about him that is truly perfect. He is as well casted a character as there is in the show.
3780	Hath4	2014-04-14	well roose was only chiding ramsay for ruing a valuable hostage, he doesn't care what atrocities he commits ie hunting women flaying prisoners he was upset because he wanted theon in one piece toÂ  trade for moat calin.
3781	The Killer Snark	2014-04-14	But...in ASoS, just before the Red Wedding, Roose makes it apparent he's not too concerned with valuing Theon as a hostage, despite what he suggests to Robb, when he presents Catelyn his flayed skin as a gift: which shows, if he isn't complicit in the flaying, he at least doesn't judge it very much.

3783	Konradsmith	2014-04-14	Before I retire for the night/morning, I'll observe that this is the second time Theon's been asked "how do you feel about that" regarding a Stark murder.
3784	Hath4	2014-04-14	the dwarves enacting the war of five kings instead of just jousting
Â 
thank god ramsay didnt rape the woman before killing her.


yeah but what he did was terrible man eaten alive by dogs is one of the most horrible ways to die.
3785	Viking	2014-04-14	Like: QoT's comment on what kind of monster murders a man at a wedding.Â 
Unlike: 5 dwarves, at this point Balon Greyjoy and Stannis Baratheon remain unvanquished. A play where the kings enemies remain standing? Unlikely.Â
3786	Mr Smith	2014-04-14	What about Jaime and Loras?
Â 
"You'll never marry her."
"And neither will you."
3787	The Kinkslayer	2014-04-14	The thing about Roose being already in the Dreadfort is: Where is "Arya"?
3788	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-14	Ramsay telling Theon that Robb was dead was good, and made me hate him more and feel some sympathy for Theon. It's good that they established the fact that both were once like brothers. Plus, Ramsay was brilliant in the way he seemed unphased despite the fact Theon had a blade, because he knew Theon wasn't going to hurt him.
Â 
Olenna's subtle little hint about killing a man at his wedding being wrong was fantastic. Obvious to book readers, but probably not so obvious to show watchers since they wouldn't suspect her.
Â 
Joffrey not only dying with Cersei, but with Jaime beside him as well was a nice touch. I wonder if it'll change Jaime's perception of the event considering it doesn't move him in the books. Maybe actually seeing it happen will make him slightly more affected by it.
3789	The hairy bear	2014-04-14	I also liked the "war of the 5 kings".Â  It was an interesting twist to the original idea, and it was real fun seeng the faces of the Tyrells during the show. Also, it opens the possibility of retconning Penny as Robb Stark if needed.
Â 


The thing about Roose being already in the Dreadfort is: Where is "Arya"?


Â 
It's easy to introduce her at S5 if they decide to follow that arch. Just have Roose complaining that he's having trouble rallying the North behind him as they are too used to follow a Stark. And then, come with the idea.

In fact, !showJeyne has never been said to travel to KL. She could be one of the girls at Winterfell that Ramsay captured, and she may have been a prisoner in th Dreadfort since then. It fits quite nicely, I think.
3790	Chebyshov	2014-04-14	Oberyn's "not you" line to Tyrion, along with the look he gives Loras. Perfecto.
3791	Raksha 2014	2014-04-14	yeah but what he did was terrible man eaten alive by dogs is one of the most horrible ways to die.


Â 
Â 
If I remember right (don't have access to the books at the moment), it was clear in the book (ADWD) that Ramsey's dogs did not kill his human quarry; they would track them down and hold them at bay and Ramsey himself would rape and kill the girls. Â  The dogs were, on the whole, nicer creatures than Ramsey (I'm not including what the dogs might have done to Jeyne, since if they did, it would have been because Ramsey trained them to do that); they gave rough comfort and shelter to Theon.
Â 
Can't wait until Ramsey dies. Â He's a horror.
3792	Colonel Green	2014-04-14	Olenna's subtle little hint about killing a man at his wedding being wrong was fantastic. Obvious to book readers, but probably not so obvious to show watchers since they wouldn't suspect her.


That line is from the books.
3793	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-14	That line is from the books.


Â 
It was? Had forgotten that. It was really well done and subtle anyway, plus we got those occasional glances to her at certain points which indicated she was up to something suspicious.

3795	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-14	Forgot to say I like the deviation of Bronn training with Jaime. It'll be a clever way to keep him active in the show while adding some witty scenes between the two character. The stuff with Ilyn is excellent in the books, but Bronn's a much more recognisable character for viewers and it helps to keep him in the show when he'd otherwise drift out of it.
3796	JesterX	2014-04-14	Not a deviation but I think I could see Olenna palm the poison as she removed it from Sana's necklace.Â  And since Joffrey's cup was right in front of her she had the perfect opportunity to poison him.
3797	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-04-14	I loved the scene of Oberyn and Cersei & Tywin. I loved everything he said, especially him continually letting Cersei know she was no longer the Queen and his remarks to Tywin about murdered children and raped women. Â 
Â 
I also enjoyed the Dreadfort scenes, especially Roose and Ramsay interaction. Â I could definitely go for more of those two.

Loved Loras / Jaime scene, witty and a laugh to end it.The deer saying Hodor made me chuckle a little.Also liked Bronn w Jaime, the two of them quipping back and forth could be great. Bronn doesn't mince words or take crap so those two could be great.

Â 
Um - the fact that Vargo Hoat/Locke and Ramsay are old buddies? Strange. Â Locke/Hoat was Tywin's creature (as much as he was anyones), until Roose turns him at Harrenhall. Â But now he has a history with Ramsay, and they are old flaying buddies. Â Just a strange confluence of creepiness.
Â 
I have to admit, it was pretty exciting that there were so many distinct changes in this episode, and that it was written by GRRM. Â We actually have some guesswork going forward.Â 
Â 
Bronn/Jaime is interesting, we are really relying on Bronn more and more here. At least we get some good quips. Jaime/Loras was fantastic - Jaime is usually the one with the best parting shots ("well then" after rescuing Brienne is still one of my favorite lines of the show), but "Neither will you" is pretty good as well.
3804	GHOSTSTARK	2014-04-14	I loved the scene of Oberyn and Cersei & Tywin. I loved everything he said, especially him continually letting Cersei know she was no longer the Queen and his remarks to Tywin about murdered children and raped women. Â 
Â 
I also enjoyed the Dreadfort scenes, especially Roose and Ramsay interaction. Â I could definitely go for more of those two.


Â 
agreed both of those scenes were great. Oberyn threw a couple shots about bastards towards Cersei and then the murdering children and raping women part was awesome. Tywin looked so annoyed. i also liked the exchange between Roose and Ramsay. showed howd Ramsay thinks hes a true Bolton but Roose shoots him down.

Â 
that surprised me. at first i thought they were all going to ride for Castle Back to take out Jon but then he just sends Hoat/Locke. i liked both Jaime and Bronn and Jaime and Loras. both were well played.
3805	Janicia	2014-04-14	Locke never had any association with Tywin. Â Locke was Roose's bannerman sent out to find Jaime after Catelyn let Jaime go. Â And now Locke has returned to the north with Roose and is being sent out to find Bran and Rickon. Â Locke fit the role of Vargo Hoat regarding Jaime, but he is not the same character. Â Interesting that he goes to the wall as a bannerman of Roose's rather than as an exile.Â 
Â 
I really liked that the dwarves played the war of the 5 kings. Â It was a gut punch to so many people at the wedding to see that, as opposed to the dwarf jousting that really only impacted Tyrion. Â 
Â 
The show emphasized Margery's unhappiness with marrying Joffrey. Â There was at least one point, when the musicians were playing "Rains of Castamere" that Margery got lost in an unhappy train of thought and had to snap herself out of it, and other times when she was squirming in discomfort at Joffrey's antics. Â I was glad to see her struggle - makes her more human. Â I didn't think the books mentioned any internal struggles she might have been having. Â
3806	Khal Shaggydog	2014-04-14	I totally forgot that part about Locke - and that he is a wholly new character for the show. I guess its just another of the show simplifiers - how to explain something like the Brave Companions and their unique place in the story? Â A Qohori captain, a bunch of random Dothraki, Rorge and Biter, zorses - too much info for the Unsullied. Â 
Â 
Its also interesting that Roose doesn't like that Locke chopped of Jaime's hand, and then later doesn't like that Ramsay chopped off Theons.... Â what goes around comes around much with mutilation?
3807	protar	2014-04-14	Bronn/Jaime fight was pretty awesome. I'm interesting to see how they keep Bronn around for Season 5. Loved the changed up Dwarf jousting as well. Thinking about it, that pretty much confirms Penny has been cut from the show which I'm rather selfishly incredibly happy about. But it was also a good scene.

3808	Seneti	2014-04-14	My top three would be:
Â 
3. Bran's vision. I'm dying to take that one apart frame by frame once it's on youtube.Â 
Â 
2. The conversation between Jaime and Loras, mainly because Jaime seems to think that foiling Loras' marriage would make him angry or sad. It doesn't, because a) Loras is gay and  he doesn't like Cersei. And it's good to see that Loras has inherited some of the Tyrell snark.
Â 
1. Tyrion spilling his own wine, after Jaime accidentally spilled his. With all the backstabbing going on among the Lannisters, it's just so nice to see that there is still some brotherly love between the two.
3809	jblair	2014-04-14	I liked the War of the Five Kings change, but making disgusting fun of your bride's brother at the wedding seems insane, even for Joff.
3810	Khal Shaggydog	2014-04-14	It wasn't his brides brother -it was his bride's first husband. Â It was his ex-fiance's brother. Â And also another man who had at least some appreciation KL, and who is still very much alive (Stannis). Â All around, it was a horrible idea, but totally Joffrey/LF. Â
3811	Sand11751	2014-04-14	Both involved Cersei; Team Lannister of her and her father vs. Oberyn and Ellaria for Team Dorne, and Cersei vs. Brienne; "But you are in love with (Jaime)" - well, goddamn, what can I say to all that except WTF.
Â 
In the first battle royale, it's clear both sides can give as good as they get. I'd say theÂ winner was Oberyn. If he could have choked Cersei with that heavy ass necklace, he'd have done it without thinking twice. Brienne's reaction after the confrontation was priceless; probably the only time she didn't have an answer for someone. I refuse to read anything into it for the future of the books; although I ship B&J, keep coming back to the fact that Cersei is the only woman Jaime's ever loved and could likely ever love. Damn shame when he kills her eventually. Â  Â Â

I take it Vargo, I mean Locke, won't get dismembered by The Mountain any time soon. I'd been morbidly looking forward to that one, seeing as it happens behind the scenes in the books.

Â 
I need to read the books again... it's been so long since my last re-read that I'm forgetting some of the details.

Â 
Everyone thought that Reeds were cut off from the show in season 2 but they appeared in season 3. So Penny can appear in the next season, those dwarves were definately dressed up, couldn't see which one was male or female. Or she could be sister of one of the performers too.
Â 


I take it Vargo, I mean Locke, won't get dismembered by The Mountain any time soon. I'd been morbidly looking forward to that one, seeing as it happens behind the scenes in the books.


Â 
I suspect Locke would be the plotÂ to get some scenes for Osha and Rickon in this season, unless they are willing to let that actress go for at least 2-3 seasons. I doubt Locke would get anywhere near the Wall and Jon Snow/Bran storylines.Â Think Locke dismembering by Shaggydog, much more satisfying.
3820	protar	2014-04-14	No it doesn't.

I suppose they could introduce some random Dwarf mad at Tyrion because her brother was mistaken for him. But it's a slight indication that she might be cut and I kind of hope she is. I just think she's such a poor character.

I don't share your conclusion at all. We don't see the face of one of the jousters (Robb Stark), so Penny could be retconned into the fight. Or just leave it at having Penny's brother be one of them. But anyway, it's not essential to Penny's character to be at KL for the wedding.

Tyrion makes mention of one of the jousters taking the King's virtue.Â  He'd be pushing it too far, knowing how Joff feels about homosexuality, to do that unless one (or more) of the jousters was a woman.
3823	Cordelia Baratheon	2014-04-14	I was kind of looking forward to Jaime sparring with Ilyn Payne and hearing him click when he wants to laugh but I mean Bronn is a pretty good replacement. Will be funny to hear sarcastic dialog between him and Jaime.


Â 
The actor who plays Ilyn Payne is quite seriously ill isn't he? That would explain why they've moved Bronn into his storylines. I'd like to see Bronn go with Jaime to the Riverlands later, I think that would work well.

Yes, you are correct, and I agree! I'd much prefer Bronn to travel with Jaime than to be shunted off to House Stokeworth
3825	Waylin Stark	2014-04-14	War of the 5 Dwarves.
Â 
Jaime vs. Bronn.
Â 
Tywin and Cersei vs. Oberyn and Ellaria.
Former Queen Regent.
Ouch.
Â 
"Hey Mom-"
"Not now Mace! Mommy has grownup stuff to talk about."
Â 
Loras to Jaime -
"And neither will you."
HA. BURN!
Â 
Ramsay, Roose, Locke and Theon gossiping while waiting for a shave.
Â 
Joffrey's nose bleeding, mouth turning red, and the blood spreading in his eyes.
Delivered the look of poison.Â
3826	The Killer Snark	2014-04-14	I love the Penny character. They had better include her or else.
3827	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-14	Someone mentioned it already, but when the High Septon says: "cursed be he who seeks to tear them apart" (or whatever), both Oberyn and Olenna were framed in that shot. Appropiate, since they both were the biggest enemies of the Lannisters back then.
Â 
Also, the War of the Five Dwarves.Â 
Â 
Margaery declaring that all leftovers were to be given to the poor (she really gets that the smallfolk make a good shield as any) and Cersei telling Pycelle to give them to the dogs. Fantastic
Â 
Ramsey happily greeting an oblivious Fat Walda cracked me up so much
Â 
Loras leaving pissed off during the dwarves' show. Nice little red herring there.
Â 
Oberyn: "Hello--not you"

Wilko Johnson, who played Ser Ilyn, is dealing with a diagnosis of terminal cancer... he's still playing shows in the UK (he's an incredible guitarist, highly influential, he was in the band Dr Feelgood) and recently released a critically acclaimed LP with Roger Daltrey from The Who... he's certainly living life as best as he's able (leaving the rest of us looking rather underachieving), giving what he's facing I think even the most diehard ASOIAF fan wouldn't begrudge him putting himself before the role of Ser Ilyn,Â  I'd be delighted if he did return to the series, I got a real kick seeing him the cast first time round... but as you say, having Bronn as a substitute as Jaime's sparring partner is great and much preferable to him following his book plot line (which would presumably have him vanishing from our screens).
3829	It's Not That Littlefinger	2014-04-14	the opening scene ras really disturbing. in a good way. also, the shaving scene was great. i really liked loras's line to jaime too. and the qot talking about how aweful it is to kill a man at a wedding. haha, so great
3830	Lady of Dragonstone	2014-04-14	Jaime and Loras's conversation. George is such a snarky little soul.
Two show improvs that foreshadow things happening in the books:
- Olenna talking to Tywin about the IB. I was surprised by this scene, but I am really glad it's there. Pretty much confirms to me that we will see some IB action on the show.
- Cersei talking to Brienne about Jaime. It's a pretty big fandom ship but the hints are so subtle that it seems like there's a lot of detractors.

Â 
I don't share your conclusion at all. We don't see the face of one of the jousters (Robb Stark), so Penny could be retconned into the fight.


Â 
I thought that, too, but the voice bellowing "I'm the King in the North!" is undoubtedly that of a man.
3832	Konradsmith	2014-04-14	That is true. But apparently one of the dwarves was played by someone named "Krysten". I don't know. It's not necessary that Penny have that connection back to the PW, so long as she loses a brother because of the Tyrion manhunt. Then again, there may not even beÂ a Penny. I think with the right actress she could be done well and be made into a more compelling character than her book counterpart who it seems a lot of ADWD readers dislike. I'm not so deadset against her, I think their dynamic if pulled off could be interesting TV.

You know, now that I think about it, what is Penny going to teach Tyrion how to do? One on one Pig/dog jousting is out, and the War of the Five Kings bit of necessity requires five players. I guess they could reenact individual battles or something.
3834	Le Cygne	2014-04-14	- Cersei talking to Brienne about Jaime. It's a pretty big fandom ship but the hints are so subtle that it seems like there's a lot of detractors.Â Is that what it is, that stops some from seeing connections?Â  Subtlety?Â  Or they just don't think one should care for the other, therefore they just dismiss the story.Â  Explain it away.Â  Pretend they are sister and brother, or not even that.Â But if it's a good author, the connection is relevant to a future plot.Â  In this case, she needs to choose, sword or noose.Â  Why does she choose noose at first, and what might she do next, given how she feels about him?

3835	Lord Damian	2014-04-14	Added dialogue North with Bolton and Ramsay. there was such an absence of it in AFFC so between 2000-2011, virtually nothing new on Roose etc... Wow. When place into perspective. That is a long fricking time.
3836	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-14	Like: QoT's comment on what kind of monster murders a man at a wedding.Â 
Unlike: 5 dwarves, at this point Balon Greyjoy and Stannis Baratheon remain unvanquished. A play where the kings enemies remain standing? Unlikely.Â 


Â 
And yet there was a statue in the city in the last episode that showed Joffrey having a mighty victory over a direwolf with a crossbow.
Â 
Joffrey having a play at his wedding that doesn't actually tell the truth? Very likely.
3837	Daedric Justice	2014-04-14	I liked the War of the Five Kings change, but making disgusting fun of your bride's brother at the wedding seems insane, even for Joff.Â

Really? More disgusting than serving Robb's head on a plate to Sansa at the feast? That was his original plan...

I'm delighted that there was no Penny. I pray to the Old Gods and New that it remains so. Pointless and boring character.
Â 
Am I reading too much into these persistent images of 'Snow' on the Iron Throne?
3838	DemonKing	2014-04-14	I loved the Renly dwarf's outfit - that huge ass crack hanging out the back and a mockÂ Loras being ridden up front - I'll have to look again to get a better view of the other costumes. You've got to hand it to Joff, he somehow managed to come up with a show that managed to insult or embarass just about everyone.

Â 
Also I LOLed when Oberyn and his squeeze waltzed into the wedding and pasued to check out that rather lithe performance artist at the entrance.

Â You're totally right. I completely missed that.
3842	Mithras	2014-04-15	It was very good to see that the pie was poisoned and the Tyrells (Margaery and Olenna) tried hard to see that Joffrey drinks the wine offered by Tyrion at the right time.
Â 
Ramsay-Roose scene was good. Roose put Ramsay in a test. If he is worthy enough to be a Bolton, he should take Moat Cailin by treachery and without losing any man. He gave him Reek to see that whether he will make use of him in this.
Â 
Olenna will be cursed as we saw her while the High Septon was speaking. The attack of the Others will be something like the Armageddon. After Mel talked about the hell they all live in, we go to Bran who is travelling north of the Wall and glimpsing the Others and wights.Â 
Â 
ETA: I also liked the "hardships" Mel suffered in her childhood.

3843	SeventySeven	2014-04-15	Both involved Cersei; Team Lannister of her and her father vs. Oberyn and Ellaria for Team Dorne, and Cersei vs. Brienne; "But you are in love with (Jaime)" - well, goddamn, what can I say to all that except WTF.
Â 
In the first battle royale, it's clear both sides can give as good as they get. I'd say theÂ winner was Oberyn. If he could have choked Cersei with that heavy ass necklace, he'd have done it without thinking twice. Brienne's reaction after the confrontation was priceless; probably the only time she didn't have an answer for someone. I refuse to read anything into it for the future of the books; although I ship B&J, keep coming back to the fact that Cersei is the only woman Jaime's ever loved and could likely ever love. Damn shame when he kills her eventually. Â  Â Â 


Â 
He's growing out of her in the books, and apparently he likes "innocence" in women now i.e. not Cersei. I think burning her letter is a pretty big indication of moving forward, and it's not even that subtle. A part of him will of course always love her, but the text tells us his mindset has changed (the wind feels like Cersei's fingers in asos, and in affc just feels like a woman's fingers). That doesn't mean he'll be with Brienne either, but it does mean he's moving on from Cersei.
Â 
I thought all of Cersei's scene this episode were very book!Cersei, you can tell when she's in grrm's hands she becomes instantly much more interesting. But the whole episode was pretty awesome.
3844	Him of Seven Faces	2014-04-15	I thought the four slices of Widows Wail to Maester Kaeth's Lives of Four Kings and not the seven we get in Storm of Swords was a book deviation that totally ruined the episode for me...Â  
Â 
Wolfsbane, Stormbringer, and what was the other suggestion?
Â 

Â 
Tyrion rubbed at his scarred, scabby nose yet again, and ugly habit that drew the eye to his ugly face. " You have never asked me how Robb died, or your lady mother."
Â 
"I... would sooner not know. It would give me bad dreams."
Â 
" Then I will say no more."
Â 
" That... is kind of you."
Â 
" Oh yes, " said Tyrion. " I am the very soul of kidness. And I know about bad dreams."

Â 
This was the biggest script change from episode one. Why have the tables turned and what purpose does it serve? In HBO's version of this scene Peter Dinklage has to play the culprit for a crime he did not commit. Same as with Oberyn. Same as with Catelyn. Damn Imp can't catch a break. Also the lack of " dream " references by all our characters is severely lacking in the show and I can't for the life of me understand why.

Sigh. I'm not referring to the moral implications, I'm referring to the strategy. Joff knows he has to keep Highgarden as happy as humanly possible, which is why he treats Marg with such courtesy. Making fun of her beloved brother makes zero sense in this setting. Serving Robb's head to Sansa would certainly display cruelty but would have no tangible political repercussions.
3846	Shane the Llama	2014-04-15	Joffrey doesn't care about keeping anyone happy. When has he ever placed political concerns over his own sadistic desires? He also needed to keep the North as happy as humanly possible, but that didn't save Ned.
3847	jblair	2014-04-15	There is a reason in the books he always treats Margaery with unimpeachable respect, and it's not because he has suddenly been inspired by a streak of virtue. He's not a complete idiot, just a partial idiot.
3848	HelenaExMachina	2014-04-15	There is a reason in the books he always treats Margaery with unimpeachable respect, and it's not because he has suddenly been inspired by a streak of virtue. He's not a complete idiot, just a partial idiot.Speaking of which, I enjoyed the wedding breakfast scene, after Joffrey is presented the book by Tyrion you see the effort he goes to, prompted by the looks from Tywin, to keep his calm and not do anything untoward. Nice touch imo.
ETA: Olenna was brilliant as ever of course, and the dropping in of the Iron Bank was a nice minor deviation imo. Also quite enjoyed the idea of Locke being sent to the Wall after Jon Snow.

Â 
Maybe. I really don't know anyone personally who has read the books and doesn't believe they'll have something going on between each other, but I see online from what I can tell, that's a bit different.
Â 
I don't think Jaime has any sort of romantic affection or "love" for Cersei any longer at this point in the books. She is the only woman he has ever loved romantically, but I think it is past tense now. It's starting to take shape on the show. Personally, I believe Brienne will choose Jaime's life.
3850	Achilles765	2014-04-17	Oberyn with tywin and cersei was GREAT.  And let's not forget that Ellaria has some good zingers too. "I have ten thousand brothers and sisters."  I love the actors that have been cast as the Dornish so far. 
Roose and Ramsay at the Dreadfort for sure, though I mourn the loss of "don't make me rue the day I raped your mother."
3851	Queen of Whores	2014-04-17	Not really a deviation, but I loved Ramsay and Locke being best mates. It made a lot of sense and was funny in a dark way.
3852	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-17	Oberyn vs the Lannister. I love how subtle yet aggressive it was:
Â 
"So, you're a bastard?"
"Yes, where everywhere in Dorne. Like your daughter... probably already found out"
"Bastards are made by passionate people! Like you... probably know, isn't? Btw, what does it feel being replaced and old?"
"How does it feel to be a younger brother?"
"Has your brother made his testame-- I mean, how is him? How's the gout? I send him my regards. I sent the starks my regards. Starks loved my regards"
"He's fine, he has a rich man's disease. You don't have it. Is because Olenna Tyrell paid for everything?"
"We have different lives here: here we don't parade our whores"
"We don't kill women and children. And I have your grand-daughter, fucktard".

In the books, it was Cersei who wanted Jon Snow killed. She was planning to send Osfryd Kettleblack to the Wall to do the deed but never got around to it
3856	Bonifer Tasty	2014-04-18	I love that you can see Olenna taking the sapphire from Sansa's necklace. Â And then, for those in the know, we get 2-3 chances later in views of Sansa to see that it is missing...always carefully places so that you can easily suppose the missing jewel is UNDER her garment. Â  Later, when Margaery takes Joffrey's wine cup away from him (after he drinks from it with no consequence), it seemed to me on re-watching it that as Margaery's right hand takes the cup, her left hand comes up to the rim as if to drop something into it. Â She then sets it down not too far from (but not too near to) her grandmother. Â  I've always wanted to know whether Margaery was involved in Olenna's plan. Â In the TV show Margaery is frequently shown to us to NOT be innocent. Â ("I want to be THE queen" and when she more or less admits to having had lots of sex to Sansa, who doesn't get it.) Â  In show world, I think she's guilty. Â  We'll see I guess. Â 
Â 
Also: Sapphires, it has frequently been pointed out, indicate deception in the novels...is that why Weiss and Beniof changed it from amethysts? Â  If so, is it book-readers who are being deceived with the hints at the jewel/goblet combo... Â  I've never been a fan of thinking the pie was poisoned...but perhaps it was.
3857	MoA«t	2014-04-20	I think it was pretty obvious they weren't going to have the pig jousting - that would've been all but impossible to film (you try getting two pigs to run at each other in a straight line, with dwarves riding them no less!) esp.Â considering the number of takes it would've necessitated, all during an already very expensive wedding reception shoot.
Â 
The mini battle (pun, yes) was perfectly fitting as was the expression on the faces of the guests as it happened.


There's not a Production Insurance company on Earth that would cover pig jousting.
3858	HelenaExMachina	2014-04-20	There's not a Production Insurance company on Earth that would cover pig jousting.

This caused me an irrational anount of laughter
3859	KnowledgeIsPower	2014-04-20	I'm not sure if this is the best board to post this on but is Balon Greyjoy dead yet? Â I was watching a discussion video on Episode 2 and they said Balon's death was announced... Â I find it weird because I normally don't miss huge things like this.. Â Is he dead in the show now?
3860	Bonifer Tasty	2014-04-20	No, Balon is still alive - although they haven't shown him. Â  Still alive in episode 3 too, unless I also missed a big announcement!
3861	aFeastForDragons	2014-04-14	I know they can bring in and out characters very easy like Ramsey, Locke(Vargo Hoat), Ser Dontos but since Tyrion is now going to spend the rest of his time in a cell this season does this mean Penny has been cut?
Â 
Personally I'm not a fan of the character but she does help with Tyrion's character development and may have a part to play in future books.Â 
Â 
Unless they introduce her in Volantis the same way but having no prior connection to Tyrion.Â
3862	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-15	Penny was a character I hated at first, but after a while I realised what her purpose was and I would be disappointed to see her cut from S5 onwards.
Â 
She doesn't need a place in S4 though - they can skip her quite easily from this season.
3863	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-15	Isn't the "Robb" dwarf kinda covered? that could be her. Or, she could be simply part of the troupe but she wasn't there because they didn't need a girl. It's even more tragic that they all got killed due to Cersei.
3864	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-15	Yeah, they don't necessarily need Penny at the wedding - she could still be introduced later and tell Tyrion that her brother was one of the jousters, thus connecting the two.
3865	MyLittleFinger	2014-04-15	Good riddance if she doesn't make it in.
Â 
Also I have a feeling it would be difficult to find a very good little person actress.Â

Â 
Also I have a feeling it would be difficult to find a very good little person actress.Â 


Â 
She was pretty good for Tyrion's development. She made him less rapey.
3868	IlAovatar	2014-04-15	As others have said, it's really not necessary for her to be at the wedding. She doesn't need to have seen Tyrion in person to identify him, if someone calls his name out..
Â 
In fact, even if there were no dwarves at all at the wedding, I wouldn't rule out Penny making an appearance because it's not necessary for her to have a brother at the wedding either. Her brother could just be some random dwarf who was mistaken for Tyrion and killed.
Â 
I'm sure it's a lot cheaper for the show producers to hire one time guest appearance actors for the dwarf scene than it is to cast a season 5 regular now for only one brief scene.
3869	MyLittleFinger	2014-04-15	Â 
She was pretty good for Tyrion's development. She made him less rapey.


Well he hasn't been near a hot woman since he met her so let's not throw things to the wind here.Â
3870	Cyvasse Khal	2014-04-15	Yeah, they don't necessarily need Penny at the wedding - she could still be introduced later and tell Tyrion that her brother was one of the jousters, thus connecting the two.


Yes this.
3871	Asshat by the Shadow	2014-04-15	I feel they could have at least had a woman be one of the jousters, then "recast" her in season 5
3872	The 10th Penny King	2014-04-15	I wrote this in the main episode forum, but the Robb Stark dwarf had a deep voice yelling "I'm the king in the North."
Â 
It will most likely be one of the performers will be her brother.Â  I'm leaning to the one who plays Joffrey.Â  He would have the blonde Lannister locks that would definitely make him a target.Â  Then, the irony would kick in that Penny would be seeking vengence for "Joffrey."
3873	Fez	2014-04-15	They could easily just not have had her at the wedding. However, I sincerely hope that she's just been cut.
3874	Chebyshov	2014-04-15	Isn't the "Robb" dwarf kinda covered? that could be her. Or, she could be simply part of the troupe but she wasn't there because they didn't need a girl. It's even more tragic that they all got killed due to Cersei.


Â 
This. Could definitely be "Robb," as has been pointed out other threads.
Â 
Also there may be no Penny. We don't know what will happen to her in TWOW, but I don't see her having staying power, and so far she hasn't been integral to the plot.
3875	juanml82	2014-04-15	Â 
She was pretty good for Tyrion's development. She made him less rapey.


Well, I'm not sure the show will go that particular way with Tyrion anyway, so there is a lot less he needs to climb back during Season 6 compared with TWOW
3876	Indigocell	2014-04-15	Sometimes I wish people would just relax and not concern themselves with issues like this.Â  Sometimes you just have to trust that the writers know what they are doing.
3877	eyeheartsansa	2014-04-16	IIRC it was her brother who was performing, not her. Â She may or may not have been at the wedding; it is a gargantuan affair and she could easily have been present but off screen. Â Maybe she was backstage in the green room or something?
3878	JagLover	2014-04-16	They could easily just not have had her at the wedding. However, I sincerely hope that she's just been cut.


Â 
Me too
Â 
The natural conclusion I would draw from DanyÂ shortly moving into her Mereen material from ADWD while Tyrion wont be leaving KL into Ep10 of this season is that, thankfully, the bulk of Tyrion's ADWD material will be cut.Â 
Â 
I am fully onboard with Tyrion very swiftly joining Dany's court (if that is how it plays out in WOW). Aside from the end of "and now his watch is ended" the Dany storyline has often been one of the weakest on the show. Tyrion would much improve things from a dialogue/character interactionÂ perspective.

3879	Rubbershanks	2014-04-16	They did use a female actress, Krysten Coombshttp://m.imdb.com/ti...ref_=m_tt_cl_sc

I don't think the actor is as important as the head remaining covered. They could be hoping off casting her role, because it's not like we'd notice a recast in this situation.

True, that is possible.  It definitely leaves the door open for that option.  However, we shouldn't base our guesses on an incorrect assumption of the actor's sex.  D&D could be taking this in several different ways.  I for one don't think Penny seems to be that important to Tyrion's storyline, except as a naive foil to Tyrion's cynical wit.  "A babe in the woods", mind you, which happens to be full of lions, dragons, and wolves. The part of Penny as such could be characterized in the future with a male or female character.

I thought she served another purpose too - she gave him a bit of grounding: this is your life now, pull your head out of your arse and get on with it. Once I came to that determination, I started to like her.
Â 
I'm not sure if that is needed to tell Tyrion's story in the show though and I expect she will be cut unless there are bigger plans for her in Winds of Waiting and A Dream Anyone is Still Alive.Â
3884	Black Wolf Smith	2014-04-20	Good riddance if she doesn't make it in.
Â 
Also I have a feeling it would be difficult to find a very good little person actress.Â 


Well unless they go out and find a completely unknown, their choice is rather limited to Meredith Eaton.

Â 
Â 
There are a few threads on the main board about the parallel story lines between Jaime and Brienne w/ Tyrion and Penny. Â While they play out quite differently both's view and position in life has dramatically changed, both have to deal w/ founding out the women the loved, didn't love them and was only using them, and both embark on a quest to find themselves w/ a new women they don't want, but seemed to need.Â
3885	Niamhikus	2014-04-20	Penny was a character I hated at first, but after a while I realised what her purpose was and I would be disappointed to see her cut from S5 onwards.
Â 
She doesn't need a place in S4 though - they can skip her quite easily from this season.


Â 
Â 
What was her purpose, i hated her, boring.....
3886	Rhaenys Reborn	2014-04-20	Penny can simply appear as a random dwarf girl whose brother got killed mistaken for Tyrion, or whose brother took part in the wedding and got killed by Cersei because of Tyrion or sth.

To be honest even that is not really necessary, she can just be a random dwarf girl and it will still work.

It's not really a clue, but I'm glad he included the dwarves, though I didn't spot any girl dwarf. Still, it may still be important later. Maybe one of them will be revealed to be Penny's brother later ? I wasn't sure she would be included, but with the dwarves at the wedding...
Â 
Not really a revelation also, but I was glad to hear Cersei bluntly say "but you love him [Jaime]" to Brienne. Poor Brienne, and her face...
Â 
I'm glad they included Walda too, I don't remember if she was in season 3. I hope they explain why Roose choose her. But does that mean she will be important ? (and why cast her if she is not ?)
Â 
More importantly : Bran's visions.
Â 
--> The dragon's shadow...I know it is probably symbolic, but does it mean that Daenerys will finally get to King's Landing ? Or is it a vision of the past ? Somehow, I think not, since it appeared after Ned's flashback.
--> Winter in King's Landing...or Snow in the throne ? What did you think ?

Have you spot anything else that could be considered as a "message" from GRRM ?

Â 
If anything comes from GRRM, it's the text. And we can't even be sure of that, as the GRRM's scripts are modifed, shuffled, moved around and rescripted at will.

3897	Asshai by the Shadow	2014-04-15	The scene at KL covered in snow and in ruins was also Dany's vision in the House of the Undying in season 1 so I think it's a prophecy that winter is coming (enventually..Â  Â ) to Westeros and whatever happens will leave KL in ruins probably from the dragon fire.Â

She looked bored to me (I thought because of its funeral march tempo), but that's a cool reading of it too!Â 
Â 
As for Penny, the "Robb Stark" dwarf's face is never shown, and the booming male voice sounded like it could have been a female disguising her voice (KotLT clue?)

It wasn't kl that was covered in snow, both times it was specifically the throne room covered in snow with the added bonus in brans vision of seeing the throne itself covered in snow.
3900	Big Daddy	2014-04-15	Seeing snow on the throne...it made me giddy.
Â 
There. I said it.
3901	Chebyshov	2014-04-15	The real question is...is it supposed to be snow on the throne (foreshadowing a great war with the others and winter sweeping the continent), or Snow on the throne?

No, the whole episode was NOT written by GRRM. Several scenes outside of King's Landing were cut from first episodes, I read it somewhere. I don't remember which ones and trying to find that article.
Thats my problem too, are Bran's scenes written by GRRM (then the visions are a MAJOR spoiler) or just by another writer, then visions are relatively meaningless - Winter will come to King's Landing, Dany "eventually" going to ride on Dragons there too and White Walkers will continue their advance southward.

Â 
Just because GRRM might not have written a scene doesn't make it "relatively meaningless." D&D wrote the first episode, so they also wrote those cut scenes, and they know what's going to happen in the end. So I wouldn't write anything off.
3904	johndance	2014-04-15	Yeah I agree I doubt there are any hints at all of whats to come in the books, if that's what you mean. Look at last season. GRRM wrote the episode where Talisa tells Robb she's pregnant. I about **** my pants when this happened, thinking 'Well George wrote this episode so that has to mean something significant!!!' Â Later, we find out though that it was D&D's idea all along. Remember, George has a lot of experience writing for TV. I bet he's just taking the outlines that D&D give him and doing his best to make that into the best scripted show he can and that's it. He is not looking for ways to drop us any clues or hints.Â

Not necessarily. Snow in Iron Throne room was a cut scene from Dany's House of Undying vision. At that time D&D had no idea what was going to happen at the end because theyÂ only laterÂ had that detailed chat with GRRMÂ andÂ went over each POV storyline with him - sometime in 2013 (When they realized that chances of him finishing last book before last season are minimal). So at the time that particular scene was written and filmed, they made it up themselves. If they wanted real hints, they might have used different scenes like reference to Song of Fire and Ice, Roses on the Wall, etc etc - book was full of them. Also, at least several scenes in Bran's tree vision were taken from previous episodes. The only new scenes are that of leaves and trees, White walker ice reflection. Even that girl scene - looks very similar to first scenes of Pilot episode.
3906	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-15	The snow on the throne and the dragon shadow over KL definitely seemed to indicate future events. Although at her current rate, KL won't be so sunny when Daenerys arrives.
3907	Masha	2014-04-15	The snow on the throne and the dragon shadow over KL definitely seemed to indicate future events. Although at her current rate, KL won't be so sunny when Daenerys arrives.


In the books, its already snowing in KL. The possible future event is the destroyed hall at which the Iron Throne sits. But because it was written before D&D had that chat with GRRM about all endings, and they added that scene with Drogo and herÂ sonÂ , it just might be random visions made up for Dany's House of Undying vision and just put into Bran's visions randomly by D&D.

Â 
Possibly, if it's a future vision of dragons though, it could always be in a distant summer, with the Targaryens in power again and the winter past. Or, it could be a vision of a dragon from the past.
3909	Asshai by the Shadow	2014-04-15	It wasn't kl that was covered in snow, both times it was specifically the throne room covered in snow with the added bonus in brans vision of seeing the throne itself covered in snow.


Correct me if i'm wrong but isn't the throne room IN King's Landing? So if the Throne room is covered in snow then logic has it, the surroundings (aka King's Landing) are also covered in snow b/c of winter.... seriously let's not get nitpicky

Â 
I always thought the snow in the throne room vision was the equivalent of the blue rose on the wall, considering they hadn't mentioned anything about blue roses until S04E01, if I remember correctly. But you are right, if they wanted it to be real hints to anything specific they would've used some of the ones in the books.
3911	Dany's Silver	2014-04-15	Bran's vision in this episode really made me wish we'd already seen Dany's vision of Rhaegar in the HotU in ACoK during season 2.Â  A repeat of that scene here would have been a delicious treat for book readers.
3912	White Harbors Wrath	2014-04-15	I really think that the crows flying through the crypts of Winterfell is the indisputable proof I've been looking for that there's a back entrance and Rickon snuck back in never making it to Skagos. Poor Davos, he's on a wild goose chase.

Not at all.Â  Visions need not be timetravelling videos of actual footage, if you will.Â  There's not REALLY a raven with an eye on top of his head, either.Â  The dragon doesn't ACTUALLY have 3 heads, the rose in the Wall isn't an ACTUAL flower, the sun isn't ACTUALLY going to rise in the west, etc.Â  Symbolism, YoungWolfling, symbolism.

3916	Impish	2014-04-15	The fact that they're showing the throne room with a destroyed roof (instead of just "snow on the throne") makes me believe it's a vision of a literally destroyed throne room, not symbolism about Jon Snow ending up on the throne.
Â 
(Then again, there's no reason the destroyed roof couldn't be symbolic also, of Jon Snow "destroying the house" that controlled the throne)

3918	RedtheWarrior	2014-04-15	Are we so sure that was snow in the Throne room? Because it looked to me like ash; maybe a prophesy of a ruined KL? Burnt by dragons?
3919	Konradsmith	2014-04-15	What about the bit with Brienne and Cersei. She says she's not sworn to Jaime but Cersei says that she loves him. This will be the conflict in their Lady Stonheart confrontation, won't it? Brienne's choice between love and duty.
3920	White Harbors Wrath	2014-04-15	I don't see it making much difference whether it's love or respect for Jaime...she had a tough decision either way.
3921	MR92	2014-04-15	I said elsewhere, but I thought the way Marg looked at the band all lovey dovey (Sigur Ros I think it was) is setting up for her arrest next season or whenever it happens. Remember that Hamish the Harper and the Blue Bard are accused.

Okay please don't be patronizing I'm well aware of symbolism but all I'm saying is that the vison of the iron throne covered in snow is literally foretelling that KINGS LANDING especially the iron throne and surroundings will be in ruins because of Dany's dragons and obviously winter is coming to KL.Some of the visions/prophecies in the books are exactly what they seem and are not vague and symbolic. It's my personal opinion this one is very straight forward.

3925	Konradsmith	2014-04-16	^Well we usually can't know until the DVD commentaries when writers and directors are pretty keen to admit about how scenes shuffle between episodes in both pre and post production. The reason people think the Stannis scenes were written for the premiere instead, is because Carice van Houten tweeted a picture of theÂ premiere script last year after receiving her scripts. It could have been a formality, or the Dragonstone scenes or a portion of them, could have been meant for "Two Swords".

Â 
Not really a revelation also, but I was glad to hear Cersei bluntly say "but you love him [Jaime]" to Brienne. Poor Brienne, and her face...
Â 
I'm glad they included Walda too, I don't remember if she was in season 3. I hope they explain why Roose choose her. But does that mean she will be important ? (and why cast her if she is not ?)
Â 
More importantly : Bran's visions.
Â 
--> The dragon's shadow...I know it is probably symbolic, but does it mean that Daenerys will finally get to King's Landing ? Or is it a vision of the past ? Somehow, I think not, since it appeared after Ned's flashback.
--> Winter in King's Landing...or Snow in the throne ? What did you think ?
Â 
Â 
Have you spot anything else that could be considered as a "message" from GRRM ?
Â 


Roose explained his choice in fat Walda to lady stark at the RW.
Â 
Saying as how green seers see the past as witnessed when Bran hooks up with BR, I'd assume the dragon shadow is of the past. Â Could be the first DwD. Â 
Â 
Penny could have been the Robb Stark dwarf because we never see that dwarf's face. Â Could be a girl for all we know. Â Winter in KL comes during the winter, and the snow in the throne room gets there because Dany burns the roof off the red keep when she invades so the snow just falls right in. Â Although it could be a metaphor for Jon Snow.
3930	Asshai by the Shadow	2014-04-16	Which visions/prophecies were straight forward?
Why would anyone need to forshadow Winter is Coming? We know it is.
SNOW on the THRONE IMO.
Eta: of they wanted to show snow in kings landing... They would have. But they chose to chose snow on the iron throne


That's reading way too much into it but sure to each their own i guess lol...
3931	Envie	2014-04-16	There's another thread about Bran's 'vision' at the weirwood tree - but this one seems to have taken over that topic as well.Â 
Â 
I think people are forgetting that Bran's connection via the "weirnet" (love that word) gave him glimpses of the past as well as what might be the future...but moreso the past because the weirwoods 'remember' things from the beginning of man's time there and even before. I think it's important to remember this in relation to the dragon shadow flying over King's Landing as it could just as well be a vision from the past when dragons did fly over KL during the first Targaryen conquest. I know it's far more satisfying to think that was a vision of the future when Dany finally gets to Westeros with her dragons, but I just thought I'd remind people that it could also be visions from the past.
3932	WiDMNDBAMMD	2014-04-17	I would think that an episode written by GRRM would be the only episode that didn't put clues into unpublished material. GRRM is the only writer that would want to try and keep it in the published material. The rest have no reason not to foreshadow things if they think that it needs to be done.
Â 
Now will there be book nods in the episode? Sure. Notice the Meereenese knot girl is back now showing off the same move?
3933	TheReal_Rebel	2014-04-17	Are we so sure that was snow in the Throne room? Because it looked to me like ash; maybe a prophesy of a ruined KL? Burnt by dragons?

Looks like ash to me, too!  My personal theory is it's not the Dragons that torched KL throne room ( as seen in end s2) but Cersei mishandling Wildfire.  So like her.

Â 
Yeah I'm not sure why Dany's dragons would torch the throne room, since all Dany wants is the throne. Â Unless she directs them to do it for revenge or something. Â  There has been way too much foreshadowing about Cersei and the wildfire/Aerys voluntarily torching KL for the wildfire not to play a part. Â But, if Dany arrives with dragons, that could be the impetus for Cersei to use the wildfire, so...
Â 
As for snow on the throne... in Dany's GoT vision, it's clearly snow. Â You can see it falling. Â I'm not a huge fan of such a literal spoiler, to be honest, IF it's meant to be that literal.
Â 
ETA Re: Bran. Â Kind of strange for him to have visions of places not connected to the weirnet, like the black dungeons of KL. Â Unless that's another spoiler about how Bran's powers expand.

i actually always thought that Cersei will eventually go mad and try to use the wildfire on KL and that's how Jaime will kill her, like he did to the Mad King. ever since the oldwoman (that i cant recall the name) said her brother will kill her i thought of Jaime, because she only thinks about Tyrion killing her and she'll never see it coming if it's Jaime.

Well in the books, Bran's traveling through the weirnet was sort of 'training' in how to interpret visions both past and present with Bloodraven's help. At first the visions were confusing and a mishmash of flashes and images. We're left with the impression that Bran's 'powers' are growing as he spends more time "jacked in" to the Westeros matrix so to speak. (He's like the GoT Neo!) haha.
Â 
My thoughts are, wondering if they didn't purposely make the visions very confusing and not much sense to convey the overwhelming sensations Bran has as he sees it all flashing past rapidly. He does glean enough out of it to know where they need to go and where to find Bloodraven.

That's certainly true of the books, but it's not very good TV.Â  Needs to be narrowed to the relevant.Â  If they wanted to show that he can see the past, it would have been better to show things that are obviously the past, like show Ned and Cat in the Winterfell godswood together in a scene we have, then Ned playing with Brandon and Lyanna at a slightly smaller tree, then winterfell being built around the tree, snow flickering on and off the ground.Â Â  Would also reinforce the "it's perception of the faces on the weirwood trees" aspect.
Â 
Just showing a random dragon flying over KL, not from a WW's POV, at some time generations ago, apropos to nothing doesn't really do much.

But they chose to chose snow on the iron throneIt's odd about a snow-wrecked KL , that was from S2E10 Dany and HOTUD , GRRM did not write that episode.Somebody can correct me, but I don't think George has a 'vision' or 'proficiency' like that in the books, so far.Tho he has hinted strongly about the Other's invasion being the biggest piece in the game on the page.If that means a literal conquest of Westeros by the Great Other I don't know... or does it just mean the Others wreck KL but can still be thrown back?

Eta: d&d had to tell grrm whom Jon's mother was before being allowed to do the show, and Danys scenes from the hotu was changed bc they would've given away too much.

It does and think its a good catch. However red or black a dragon is a dragon. I just always felt that phrase was misleading in of itself, mummers dragon. As in Varys himself is the mummer and aegon is the dragon he is backing. I mean considering Illyrio is backing him as well and the bf theory stems from him and Serra, why no mention of the cheese mongers dragon?

Â 
I totally agree with this. I'm convinced that Jamie is the Valonqar. Wildfire would be a great cause.
Â 
As for Bran's vision, here's my takeâ<U+0080>¦..
Â 
- Something must be in the Winterfell crypts that has to do with Lyanna/Jon/Ned and Ice. (In the pilot episode, when Ned is passing the sentence on the Night's Watch deserter, there is a semi-closeup on the hilt of Ice, and there's some small design on the pommel. I've always thought it looked like a tiny blue rose, but I have no idea why that would be important if it were even the case.)
Â 
- The shot of Ned in the black cells is interesting because of the reflection of Varys's torch in his eye. No idea about that one.
Â 
- The little girl wraith from the pilotâ<U+0080>¦. Bran sees some of what they have to stay away from.Â 
Â 
- The mass of ravens from last season's death of the WW by Sam the Slayer (I hope we still get that title for him), and the Death Mount for the WW - Â More of what they have to watch our for?
Â 
- The Red Keep Throne Room - identical to Dany's vision. I think this is HUGE. (It's also the longest of all the snippets.) In Dany's vision, she reaches for the Iron Throne but never touches it. The throne will never be hers, as it's not her's by right anyway. The room is a burned out ruin. I think it must mean dragons destroying King's Landing perhaps? I don't think it would be wildfire, since nothing would be left, not even the throne.Â 
Â 
- Snow on the Iron Throne. I am in the Jon Snow camp here, especially since we've now been exposed to it twice.
Â 
- The ice shardsâ<U+0080>¦â<U+0080>¦ an ice cell perhaps? It seems as if we're looking though the ice. There's also more than one face - there's another one that appears just at the end of that snip, up and to the left of the one that's moving. It's easier to see on a TV than it is if you're trying to view it on youtube, especially if you can frame-by-frame advance on a DVR.Â 
Â 
- Cersei's voice while Bran falls (mother!) - I hope that's his memory returning.
Â 
- Dragon over KL - It's not just a dragon shadow. It's also a bird. On one sweep of the wings, the left one is a bird wing - you can see sunlight through the fingers of the feathersâ<U+0080>¦ Bran will warg a dragon, which opens up Jon and Arya to do the same (if they don't cut their warging abilitiesâ<U+0080>¦..)

O, yea book is different than show totally. I just looked at it as the hint people would've gotten had they shown the toj scene from Ned's dream. But we both know, if they had shown that, a 2 yr old would've been able to put the clues together, and that will be a huge reveal on the show where it reaches a bigger audience. Too bad grrm isn't a faster writer unless we get it in twow.
3968	The Reckoner	2014-04-20	The sun won't rise in the west, but the son of Rhaegar and Lyanna will be rising in Westeros. From the dead and all.
3969	A Man Has Said	2014-04-20	As GRRM wrote this episode, we can all assume he left some clues in it, or some "canon revelations". What did you notice, what did you think of them ?
Â 
I will start :
Â 
It's not really a clue, but I'm glad he included the dwarves, though I didn't spot any girl dwarf. Still, it may still be important later. Maybe one of them will be revealed to be Penny's brother later ? I wasn't sure she would be included, but with the dwarves at the wedding...
Â 
Not really a revelation also, but I was glad to hear Cersei bluntly say "but you love him [Jaime]" to Brienne. Poor Brienne, and her face...
Â 
I'm glad they included Walda too, I don't remember if she was in season 3. I hope they explain why Roose choose her. But does that mean she will be important ? (and why cast her if she is not ?)
Â 
More importantly : Bran's visions.
Â 
--> The dragon's shadow...I know it is probably symbolic, but does it mean that Daenerys will finally get to King's Landing ? Or is it a vision of the past ? Somehow, I think not, since it appeared after Ned's flashback.
--> Winter in King's Landing...or Snow in the throne ? What did you think ?
Â 
Â 
Have you spot anything else that could be considered as a "message" from GRRM ?
Â 


That wasn't at all how I saw it.
What I think was being shown was a vision of the PAST, not the future
- from some time after Aegon's conquest when the Targaryens still had full-grown, battle-trained dragons.
Â 
Least ways, in the books all of Bran's visions (other than the ones involving the three-eyed crow)..

	Spoiler ..which I believe were being transmitted to Bran by BloodRaven. (as were some of Jojen's visions.) 

..were about the past.
Weirnet is NOT the gift of prophecy. It is what I call telescience (visions of distant events) not prescience (visions of future events.)
Â 
I think them using the shadows of (obviously VERY large!) dragons over King's Landing was a clever misdirect on the showrunners part.Â 
Wasn't that scene in all or most of the trailers for the season?
It's essentially a promise to the Unsullied that they WILL be seeing Dany in Westeros this season.

	Spoiler  And as book readers know, that is an empty promise.

Yeah, from that perspective I can see why he wouldn't want to perhaps continue. Who knows though, when he's a bit older he may decide to have another go at it. People change, as do their opinions and choices in life, so hopefully he'll return at some point in the future.

The "dirge" theme they went with is very compelling. In fact I think I like it even better than The National's version done in a previous season and I really didn't think anyone could top that!

They were VERY amused to see Evil King Joffrey literally throwing money at Sigur Ros to make them go away (which I how I first realized the musical troupe actually was a celebrity cameo, and that it was actually them singing over the ending credits instead of Jack Gleeson himself [which would've been really cool]).

3996	SlowLoras	2014-04-19	They're one of my all-time favourite bands. I leapt up and yelled at the TV when I saw them. Great version of Rains of Castamere too...wonderfully dark interpretation of the song.
3997	The Black Wolf	2014-04-14	Did anyone else notice the distinct lack of Joffrey mentioning that he was already familiar with valyrian steel? I mean, it was a pretty important part in the book that clued both Tyrion and the reader in to who it was that tried to have Bran killed. I wonder how they will solve this in the show... They might simply ignore it, since it hasn't been brought up in a very long time, but that just seems so sloppy. Does anyone have any ideas about how this might be dealt with?
3998	robdavies1775	2014-04-15	I'd be surprised if they just forgot about that plot point considering how dedicated David and Dan are but that does seem to be the case, which is a great shame. The show-watchers have probably forgotten about it, it was so long ago!

You could argue that it puts Jaime in a more sympathetic light, since it was him and Cersei that were heavily implicated in the attempted murder in the first place.

Sure, but finding out 3 years later about an event that didn't even work as planned isn't vital. It's bad story telling to lazily reveal years later something that's irrelevant to the current story. Especially when that that "mystery" brings up a major plot hole of "Why the hell did Tyrion do nothing about being framed for murder and almost executed."

It is pretty moot now, though I wouldn't be surprised if this turns up as a deleted Season 4 scene. They have to be parsimonious about what they show. This would have taken too much screen time for very little pay-off.

It may not be important for the future of the series, but I still think it's really sloppy just leaving that "mystery" hanging there. It would be similar to if they didn't mention who it was that poisoned Jon Arryn in this season (or the next). The attempted murder of Bran was one of the key events that lead to the war (seeing as it was what pushed Catelyn to King's Landing, which then lead to her capturing Tyrion...), it would be nice to know how it happened. If they wanted to have something in the episode to remind the viewer of that moment in season one they could have had Bran tell Jojen something about how Summer saved his life when they are talking about the warging... I don't know, it isn't crucial to future episodes, but it's rather disappointing...

4006	Colonel Green	2014-04-15	I'm not entirely surprised they omitted it.Â  It's probably the least-compelling plot resolution in the books to date, and by this point that mystery has completely fallen out of people's contemplation.Â  And it's not like the murder of Jon Arryn in that it has no real implications going forward.

Â 
The thing about Jon Arryn's murder is mostly everyone really did think it was Cersei who did it/was in on it, and had no idea of the scope of plotting Baelish had gone through to get where he was. It really makes his character when that's revealed, it's hugely defining. However, finding out that a scumbag kid tried to have another kid killed isn't really that surprising or informative, and we all knew it wasn't Cersei or Jaime. That Only Cat scene forces you to go back and realize how almost the entire scope of the novels was really all planned and manipulated. Thinking back on the assassination attempt makes you think..."Wow, fucking Joffrey."
Â 
I don't disagree they should've had the line but to imply it's super important to have and a big mystery that needs solving is pretty false.

Â 
I actually find those two revelations to be very compelling opposites. The truth about Jon Arryn's death shows, like you said, how much of the story has been conditioned by Littlefinger's plotting, whereas the truth about the attempt to murder Bran shows how random some things have been. It wasn't Cersei, Littlefinger or Varys plotting something, it was just this seriously messed up kid that inadvertently put a lot of things in motion.
Â 
Like I've said before, it isn't really important to the future of the show (so i agree with you there), but still... they needn't even have done it like in the books. They could have revealed it sooner/in some other way.
4009	jet199	2014-04-15	I suppose they could have Jaime work it out while the trial is going on. Then he could discus it with Tyrion when he frees him and Tyrion can say he worked it out.
I always thought the subtext around the Joffery revelation was that Cersei blamed Robert for saying Bran should be put out of his misery and actually it was her. She and Jaime were certainly saying similar things to Tyrion at Winterfell and we don't have anything similar being said by Robert. It would be interesting if they bring this out more in the show.
4010	Janicia	2014-04-15	The problem with revealing it during the royal breakfast is that Tyrion would need somebody to talk to. Â He can't just blurt it out to the world at large. Â In the book, the reveal happened in Tyrion's head. Â Tyrion just has too much going on that day, with very little privacy for gossiping about murders that Joffrey may have tried to commission years ago. Â It may come up when Jaime or Varys visits Tyrion in jail. Â It may come up between Sansa and Littlefinger (Littlefinger would have figured it out ages ago). Â Actually, if the show wants a scene with Littlefinger training Sansa in politics, that would be a neat case study for them to discuss. Â But it is hardly the most important thread that the show is at risk of leaving hanging. Â
4011	the maester	2014-04-19	I think this is a very important plot point. 
The realisation that Jeff's stupidity lead to his incarceration and nearly being executed, made Tyrion's hatred towards Joffrey reach a new level &  made him bigger suspect for his poisoning.

Speaking of poor storytelling in the novels, in ACOK, Tyrion thinks to himself that he needs to have a conversation with Littlefinger about a certain dagger, but that conversation never takes place.
4013	Newstar	2014-04-19	Sure, but finding out 3 years later about an event that didn't even work as planned isn't vital. It's bad story telling to lazily reveal years later something that's irrelevant to the current story. Especially when that that "mystery" brings up a major plot hole of "Why the hell did Tyrion do nothing about being framed for murder and almost executed."
Â 
Pretty much. The blame for bad storytelling lies with GRRM for dangling that point for a few books only to resolve it in a way that has absolutely no bearing on the plot from here on in.
Â 
Besides, in the TV universe, where we don't have the benefit of POV thoughts and where it's been several seasons since there was any mention of the dagger, how on Earth would that information be conveyed? Tyrion would have to have a conversation with someone--Bronn, I guess?--laboriously reminding the audience of the backstory and giving voice to his suspicions, but what would be the point? The writers are pretty ruthless about leaving out anything that doesn't advance the plot in some way, which the dagger revelation doesn't.
Â 
And really, when you try to imagine how that theoretical conversation would go, the ridiculousness of the idea is exposed.
Â 
Tyrion: Guess what, Bronn? Joffrey said he is no stranger to Valyrian steel.
Bronn: So?
Tyrion: That means he's handled Valyrian steel before!
Bronn: So?
Tyrion: The dagger that was used by the assassin was Valyrian steel!
Bronn: So?
Tyrion: That means Joffrey picked the Valyrian steel blade to arm the assassin!
Bronn: So?
Tyrion: What do you mean, "So?"
Bronn: Well, Bran's dead, Joffrey's dead, we all knew Joffrey was an asshole, and you can't prove any of it.
Tyrion: I guess when you put it that way....

Yeah, they haven't forgotten about the storyline, tyrion mentions his Â capture in the season premiere.
Â 
I'm not sure if they will point the finger at Joffrey as the attempted murderer though. It seems a real small reveal when it's hinted at in the ASOS. I was more like "oh so that's what happened" instead of "OH SHIT IT WAS HIM?"
4016	lostinasia	2014-04-19	Could it be revealed in the infodump that Littlefinger's surely got coming near the end of the season? "And that little Joffrey unwittingly helped my plans, using my old dagger in his attempt to have Bran Stark 'put out of his misery'. Unplanned by me, but I certainly used that happenstance to turn the Starks against the Lannisters. Only a shame that the Imp didn't precede Lyanna out that door." (All said in a raspy Batman voice.)
Â 
I agree that the assassination attempt on Bran should be resolved in the show - it's silly to leave it hanging. Mind you, I also agree that it didn't really work in the book either - the Lannisters have been desperate for Valyrian steel for generations, Joffrey gets his hand on Valyrian steel, and he uses it to pay a hired thug?!
4017	T.C	2014-04-19	Maybe HBO are going to actually do something smarter than Martin and suggest it was Cersei who did it, seeing as that was more logical.
4018	King Tommen	2014-04-19	Not to mention that in order to make Joffrey the culprit, Martin has to shoehorn in motivation for him that doesn't really make sense. Joffey's a sadistic asshole who doesn't care about the welfare of other people so the only logistical reason he would have to go through with this would be to gain the approval of Robert, who he can't tell because the whole thing has to remain a secret. It completely falls apart if you think about it for more than 5 seconds, which Martin clearly doesn't want us to do based on how little importance he put behind the revelation.
Â 
The most obvious reason to send an assassin to kill Bran would be to shut him up so that he couldn't tell anyone what he saw (meaning it's either Jaime or Cersei). Why Martin decided to change this after the fact to something so silly is trying to add a twist for no good reason is beyond me.

4037	andrew_	2014-04-13	The reason everyone noticed him was because the show-runners wanted you too, he is obviously gonna have a big part to play so they wanted the viewers to remember and identifies his face. This is the first time Tommen had this much screen time since the Blackwater episode.

I sincerely doubt that even one non-reader watched that episode and thought "They are showing numerous glimpses of Tommen at this crowded wedding in which they are showing numerous glimpses of everyone; that must mean he's the next king and Joffrey is about to die"

This. Â Also, given that Tommen wasÂ re-cast, I don't think many non-readers even realized he was there. Â Hindsight/spoiler-sight are 20/20... Â People need to chill a bit.

They could probably switch the actors of Tommen and Rickon and half of the casual fanbase would be like "Oh okay cool"


Â 
I think it's likely Rickon will be re-cast as well if he get's a larger role some time in the farther future.Â

4043	Newstar	2014-04-13	I'll wait until New Tommen actually has lines before passing judgment on him. The actor definitely looks as if he could be NCW and Lena Headey's son, though.
Â 
I'll be interested to see what they do with TV Tommen's characterization. I don't think Book Tommen's enthusiasm for kittens and stamping documents really translates to something that could be played by an actor New Tommen's age, but I guess we'll see.
4044	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-04-13	I dont like it. An older Tommen makes Cerseis manipulatiom not so convincing. Furthermore, we lost all the kittens and outlawing beet scenes...
I guess they did it to not kill a younglin later.

Or they did it because it would be weird seeing Tommen still being a little kid while the other child characters (Arya, Bran, etc.) have grown up.

4047	IlAovatar	2014-04-13	I sincerely doubt that even one non-reader watched that episode and thought "They are showing numerous glimpses of Tommen at this crowded wedding in which they are showing numerous glimpses of everyone; that must mean he's the next king and Joffrey is about to die"


I've already spoken to two non-readers who picked up fairly easily from the episode that the strange boy constantly being shown seated with the royal family had to be Joffrey's brother being deliberately introduced now to replace Joffrey. Admittedly, they already knew Joffrey was going to die, but I expect a lot of non-readers have guessed that by now even if they haven't heard rumours or spoilers.

So the previous actor doesn't age each year the same way Bran's actor does? Someone should get in touch with him and ask for the secret to immortality quick!
Â 
I don't know the kid's age because his DOB isn't on imdb, but if he's not aging fast enough because he's more than a few years younger than the kid who plays Bran then that's a poor casting decision to begin with. They should have seen this problem happening at the start and hired someone the same age.

Yeah I agree with that. You see him chuckling at the dwarf melee and then looking at Tyrion and having the tact to stop smiling. I think we'll see a Tommen a bit aged up in all ways. But I think it won't take away from the main development: It's Tywin's show this season, and Cersei's next. Tommen will not be featured anywhere near as much as Joffrey was.Â
4054	lostinwesteros	2014-04-14	This one is definitely older, so a pairing with Margaery would seem less ridiculous, but somehow I can't see this new Tommen with the Ser kitties.

You'll note that I didn't actually say in my original post that it would give away Joffrey's death to people who weren't already expecting him to die eventually. It's only going to seem like they were shoehorning in a new king to those who at least had some inkling that Joffrey was going to die at some point this season.

Â 
I'll agree to disagree then.
4057	Bran Snow	2014-04-14	The character that plays this new Tommen played Martyn Lannister last season
4058	Khal-a-bunga	2014-04-14	The reason everyone noticed him was because the show-runners wanted you too, he is obviously gonna have a big part to play so they wanted the viewers to remember and identifies his face. This is the first time Tommen had this much screen time since the Blackwater episode.


Â 
It's actually the first time sinceÂ BlackwaterÂ that Tommen has been on screen at all. He hasn't appeared in 12 episodes, to be precise. And, other than his scene in the aforementioned episode, the most screen time his character had was when Tyrion arrived in King's Landing inÂ The North Remembers. In that episode Tyrion even mentions that Tommen is 'growing like a weed', and that he's going to be 'taller than The Hound', in fact.Â 
Â 
I'd even say that this current actor isn't all that dissimilar from the original actor. Less so than the prior Daario to the new Daario, in any case.Â 
Â 
Not seeing the big issue with the re-cast, and I find it quite baffling that anyone could judge his acting abilities - with such absolute certainty - given that he didn't even have any lines. His small part as one of the Lannister cousins is probably a better indication of his acting ability, and I thought he was perfectly fine.Â

4060	lizziebeth	2014-04-14	I'm interested in seeing what they do with this new Tommen.Â  He certainly looks like I've always imagined a Lannister: blond and pretty.Â  No he's not chubby as described in the books, but honestly he's a teenage boy, it's believable for him to go from chubby cute kid to shooting up like a weed and being thinner taller and older.Â  All the kids have been aged up so it makes sense to me.Â  I'm sure some things will have to change (I doubt the passion for kitties and using the seal would be believeable in his current age, but I want to see how the writers handle it). For now I'm reserving judgement until we see where the writers are taking this and the skill of the actor.
4061	snowy	2014-04-14	I dunno, I can see this new Tommen loving cats.Â  All one has to do is watch my 25 year old son cradling his 18 year old kitty that had been his best buddy since she was a few weeks old to know adolescent boys can still love their cats.Â Â  They may completely remove that, and that's OK, but if they don't I can totally buy a kitty in his lap a lot of the time.

Exactly.
Besides, the thing with weddings is that the family sits together, so Tommen would naturally be in the whole episode very close to his brother.

Â 
In that case, they should also recast Cersei, cause she ain't beautiful either!Â 
The new Tommen looks just like Joff. I had to rewind because I thought that was Joff standing next to Cersei in the audience at his own wedding!Â
4076	Chebyshov	2014-04-14	I hate that in season three Marcella was in tears being sent to Dorne when it was Tommen in tears.

No, he cries too, because Joff says something like "a prince should never cry." I think both Tommen and Marcella are in tears.
Â 
Also I was worried he was too old looking before watching last night's episode, but I think he'll do fine. He just seems like a cute little pre-teen, and even showed a bit of his softer disposition when he began to laugh at the dwarves and then stopped after seeing the look on his uncle's face.
4077	Mel_Rose	2014-04-14	I agree he has the air of innocence that the character is supposed to have. As for the kitties, he might just refer to them, say how he used to play with the kittens and gave them names.
Still, I don't rule out seeing those cats. I am much older but still cuddle with my cat

So, show Tommen is actually 4 years older than book Tommen. Hence, the re-cast makes sense. I liked how the boy looked - a true, beautiful, good-natured golden lion.

this means that most of his scenes will have to be rewritten or removed since they will not fit with an older "tommen". much like many sansa scenes were rewritten or removed. for example, i don't expect to see any kittens. it will be interesting to see the tone of the marriage, though. i think that's what all book readers are waiting to experience.

Did they ever even introduce him? Â Like a close-up shot or a mentioning of his name? Â Because I didn't even know he was there until he laughed at the jousting scene.Â 


Â 
They didn't call Mace Tyrell by name either, so people are probably wondering who that old guy was that randomly appeared giving a present.

I don't see why this is a big deal, all of Tommen's scenes on the tv show so far have not matched anything that was in the books. Especially his last scene before S4 in the Blackwater episode.

That's actually the question for producers. I cannot answer it. The book Tommen is 7 when Robert arrives to Winterfell at 298AL. So, he would be 9 by now. Subsequently, the show Tommen would start by being 11 and would be 13 by now. The original Tommen could never pass as a 13-year-old.

they did indeed get unlucky with bran since he's supposed to be carried everywhere and is definitely too big for that. but other than that, his age doesn't really impact his story line much and he never needed to look like a child OR do things a normal boy would not do, like marry someone. Â very little, if anything, has had to be changed because of bran's aging up however, sansa's story line has changed as a result of her being older. we heard nothing of her obsession with songs and her connection to dontos being a character from a song was removed. missendei was aged up due to her role in dany's court. it would be very hard for the modern viewer to see a child in that role. (yes i know she'll probably have sex scenes but i really think it's her job that caused her to be aged up.)Â i'm also pretty sure myrcella will be aged up if her betrothal is announced on the show. so aging tommen up now isn't really that hard to understand, especially since they most likely didn't know who margeary would be when he was cast. that's another reason i think tommen's being aged up: margeary is much older than in the books.

Sorry, but I don't think the disruptive and sudden nature of the actor switch can be justified by the need to have Tommen sitting on Cersei's lap in one scene. The new actor could have passed as sweet and innocent back then compared to Joffrey, and they could quite easily have shown Cersei handing him poison during the attack on KL.Â
4096	TheKitttenGuard	2014-04-14	That actually the question for producers. I cannot answer it. The book Tommen is 7 when Robert arrives to Winterfell at 298AL. So, he would be 9 by now.

Â Â  They established in S1 that Tommen eight year old between Loras and Renly.Â  In the books Tommen was crowned at eight.
Â 
Â  All we have now is a visual of Tommen and in no way established his age.Â  There are many kids who are bigger than their age.Â  We will probably get some discussion of his age in the following episodes.Â 
Â 
Â  Tommen big scene was him starting to laugh at the drawfs and than seeing that Tyrion looked hurt he stopped himself.
Â 
Â  Anyone else see Tywinn shielding Tommen during Joffrey's death scene?Â  It is just after Cersei shoves Margaery aside you see Tywinn moving towards Tommen and then with Jamie and Cersei kneeling to Joffrey Tywinn has hisÂ arms around Tommen head.

It's still lame. Â No one forced them to cast a 30 something actress as Marg, or to cast Tommen initially as that young. Â Recasting is very jarring and a sign of serious missteps unless somebody dies. Â It isn't like they didn't know that Tommen and Marg would end up married.

Â  All we have now is a visual of Tommen and in no way established his age.Â  There are many kids who are bigger than their age.Â  We will probably get some discussion of his age in the following episodes.Â 
Â 
Â  Tommen big scene was him starting to laugh at the drawfs and than seeing that Tyrion looked hurt he stopped himself.
Â 
Â  Anyone else see Tywinn shielding Tommen during Joffrey's death scene?Â  It is just after Cersei shoves Margaery aside you see Tywinn moving towards Tommen and then with Jamie and Cersei kneeling to Joffrey Tywinn has his hands around Tommen eyes.

According to these sources, Tommen is to turn 9 at 300AL. Maybe he is not nine yet. Who cares? I like new Tommen.
4099	Chebyshov	2014-04-14	I think we're ignoring the possibility that they could have recast Tommen due to acting ability. It might not be all about age.
4100	jons nissa	2014-04-14	i definitely think the directors didn't cast anyone with the plan to recast them later but i do think they gave less attention to some of the minor characters than they might have needed to give. tommen as a kid made sense in season 1 and 2 but didn't after that. they realized their goof and changed him to a teen, especially given the casting of margeary. the end.
Â 
should they have considered that when they cast marg? yes, and there were plenty of threads discussing that when the news was announced. so i think the problem was margeary not tommen but i think natalie has done an amazing job in the role and clearly the directors thought she would, too. so recasting a character that had such a limited amount of screen time hardly seems like a crime. i fully expect rickon to be recast when he re-emerges, too.
4101	Greywolf2375	2014-04-14	Since Tommen has had basically 0 screen time in forever and even then wasn't critical to anything, a recast bothers me 0.Â  When they are casting would I like them to try to match the description in the books...sure, and overall they've done a great job.Â  I think it will be an interesting contrast now - in the books we get that Tommen is young & plump and awkward.Â  With this recast, the audience is going to see two siblings who look very very similar, but act very very differently.Â  We really don't have that much in this show - though Jaime & Cersei are starting down that path.
Â 
Honestly, if he can act, rock on.Â  he has the Lannister look, good enough for me in this one.
4102	jons nissa	2014-04-14	greywolf,
you make an interesting point about wanting to cast someone who looked more like joffrey than the first actor did.Â
4103	Chebyshov	2014-04-14	should they have considered that when they cast marg? yes, and there were plenty of threads discussing that when the news was announced. so i think the problem was margeary not tommen but i think natalie has done an amazing job in the role and clearly the directors thought she would, too. so recasting a character that had such a limited amount of screen time hardly seems like a crime. i fully expect rickon to be recast when he re-emerges, too.


Â 
They had their work cut out for them with casting Marg, because they needed her to be married to Renly without it being creepy (by our Western standards) and also be able to be betrothed to Tommen. Natalie is amazing though, so any recasts necessary for her to fit in are fine by me.
4104	TheKitttenGuard	2014-04-14	Â 
It's still lame. Â No one forced them to cast a 30 something actress as Marg, or to cast Tommen initially as that young. Â Recasting is very jarring and a sign of serious missteps unless somebody dies. Â It isn't like they didn't know that Tommen and Marg would end up married.


Â 
Â  Well their focus during the beginning is to make sure that the show was going to be made and renew.Â  To be concern of where a character in 3 years and cast is not big.Â  Casting the Starks children were very important.Â  Though they could of Tommen and Bran same age at 10 on the show would of been ideal in hindsight.
Â 
Â  Casting for children has always been difficult.Â  Basing on a book series were the actual age of the characters are only 2-3 years adds to it.Â  Without this being an animated series this was always going to be a issue with so many children actors.Â
4105	BlackStark	2014-04-14	The re-cast to a noticeably older actor does alter the manner in which the character is presented. Â You will have to temper the level of his naivete and highly manipulable nature because the mindset of 7 yo (or even a 9 to 10 yo) does not translate well to the body of a teenager unless your goal is to make him look mentally challenged. Â The dynamics of the Tommen-margarey relationship is also changed...there was some justification to keep a 17 yo and a 7 yo apart (it was an absurd pairing) but there is no reason to separate two teenagers especially when the girl is the older party. Â 
Â 
Whether it ultimately matters, we don't know because their idea of who and how TV Tommen acts and behaves may be totally different than his book counterpart. Â Same name, different character.
4106	LifeRuiner	2014-04-14	I actually prefer the re-cast. He's more plausible as a Joffrey sibling, and I remember from his Other Lannister role that he could act a bit. Also, his marriage to Nat Dormer as Margaery will look less absurd. An older actor can have a better acting range as well.Â 
Â 
I've always thought that Tommen's pawn story had potential: he's torn between the loyalty to his mother and the shiny bright flattering people that are Tyrells. I'd be far more interested to see a teenager than a child going through this arc.Â
4107	SamanthaofTarth	2014-04-14	I think we're ignoring the possibility that they could have recast Tommen due to acting ability. It might not be all about age.


Â 
At the time of the recasting, I did hear the reason given that Callum was recast partly because he himself had little interest in acting anymore, and wanted to pursue other things.
4108	MassiveDynamic	2014-04-14	i thought he looked a lot older than i remembered.. that explains it.Â
4109	Ahri Adaran	2014-04-14	I think we're ignoring the possibility that they could have recast Tommen due to acting ability. It might not be all about age.


Â 
Exactly. The old Tommen had barely any lines and didn't really do any acting so there's no reason to think he can act especially well since they mostly just grabbed him for the look. So far I've been impressed with the show's casting and the only one's that really annoyed me (Illyrio being godawful and Mance being horribly miscast despite being a good actor) were due to last minute casting changes.

4110	Chebyshov	2014-04-14	Interesting, but the new actor played Martyn Lannister last season (one of the boys Lord Karstark killed...the one who asked Talisa if Robb was a wolf). Guess they liked what they saw in that scene.

4111	Ser Not Appearing	2014-04-14	If the original actor has less interest in acting and a recast was already in order because if that, (I'm being this on the above comments), I don't have much problem with them rethinking what sort of recast might be the most advantageous. Certainly a new Tommen who looks like the old Tommen has advantages... but if it interferes with other things, you do have to consider whether a one-time... "Who is that?" ... is better than an ongoing hindrance to the story.
If they just didn't consider things enough when they cast the original actor and the change now is unforced and entirely optional, they dropped the ball - and it's still not that big a deal being that you'd prefer it hadn't happened.
Age-wise I'd expect less child naivete. You can still get across the main point of a battle between Cersei and Marg, however, and a teenage over-sweetness / gullible nature could be added to give him a semblance of the same thing (but isn't necessary).
It's not a big loss either way, imo. Ser Pounce was a means to a story-telling end. It isn't necessary.

See, again, that's lame, and insulting to the audience. Â Sorry. Â Is there some dearth of good looking teenage blond actors or something?

So, Martin Lannister got kissed by Mel and resurrected as Tommen. Great.
4115	ChrisSnow77	2014-04-14	I don't really care that Tommen isn't plump...and I could care less if he plays with cats or not.Â  But the fact that he's little enough in the book that he is "playing king" having fun with his seal on whatever document is set before him, is a pretty important plot point.Â  I'm guessing they will have to trick him into putting his seal on documents now, as I'm hoping he wouldn't be naive enough to do that without reading at his age.Â
4116	Waylin Stark	2014-04-14	This Tommen seems like a good enough chap.
Like when he was laughing at the dwarves, he looked at Tyrion, and then stopped.
Â 
But that's the problem. He looks like 13-14, what Joffrey was in the books.
Book Tommen was really young, and that served with him being as a clear puppet.
This one is older, so I don't know how they'll play the puppet thing.
Â 
And childish Book Tommen contrasted well against teenage Margaery telling him what to do.
I don't see the new one being fought over by Cersei and Margaery.

Â 
We'll just wait and see. I have every confidence in Show!Margery to get her hooks into this one.
4118	Miss Carnahan	2014-04-14	Sad to see the previous actor go, he was so adorable and perfect for the role. I suppose they cast an older boy so the age difference between him and Natalie wouldn't be so terrible.
4119	Yukle	2014-04-14	Â 
He seems nothing like the character I imagined from the books. Where the original Tommen was spot on.


Â 
I agree. And poor kid, he finally had a role to play and they recast him.
4120	Kate Poem	2014-04-14	/sigh/
No cats. No love for stamping. No hate for beets...
Twin brother of Joffrey???
Where is 8 years old plump sweetheart, where is he?
/sigh off/
4121	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-14	Some of you are really scraping the bottom of the barrel on this one.


Â 
Why would we? Tommen is a part you wouldn't give to a 16 years old because he would look ridiculous. It's so hard to find an eleven years old who could play the part? Art Parkinson was 11 when he was cast as Rickon and he's believable. He also did fine with the parts given and he's recognisable. Everybody praise GoT cast for choosing well the children. Couldn't they find an 12 years old actor to play young Tommen? He's not having sex with Margaery, he's just to have a wedding ceremony.
4122	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-14	To paraphrase Olenna: "Old..." Or at least compared to book!Tommen
Â 
What makes the character great is how jarring the image of him on the Iron Throne (which I think the show will do eventually) or using Joff's over-sized crown is. Like, he's not supposed to be young. He needs to be very young, and childish, and naive, and to play with kittens and outlaw beets and be bored with any kingly duty that doesn't involve the royal seal.
Â 
I'm withholding judgement for now, but I hope the reason for the re-casting was not because "Natalie Dormer would have looked way too old for him". Well, first, this is Game of Thrones (Craster's or Walder's wives, anyone?). And second, his marriage to Margaery is supposed to look fucked-up. It's supposed to highlight how tacky and desperate the Lannisters and Tyrells are to continue the alliance, it's supposed to show how vulnerable and pliable Tommen is, and it's supposed to give Lannister fans a king they could root for!

Isn't the age difference worse now that he's older and capable of having sex?
4124	-Ghost-	2014-04-14	Yeah, Tommen's story is gonna have to change a little. He's most likely not gonna be playing with kittens and outlawing beets, but it's really not that big of a deal.
4125	Lord Damian	2014-04-14	At least the new Tommen has really blond hair. Does it bother anyone else that if Dany has the Targ hair, Why cannot Jaime and Tyrion on the show have the blond hair that is so prominant in the books?

Tyrion's hair is all over the map. Rewatch the pilot and platinum Tyrion makes an appearance. But this explains it: http://youtu.be/Nopc6wY35J0

I know, does it not irritate you though, him and Jaime basically have dark hair and it is the hair that is the give away to the bastardy of Cercei's kids?

4130	The Eunuch	2014-04-14	I have no doubt this new actor will be awesome, otherwise he wouldn't have get the job. Let him have his chance before criticizing.
Emilia is 26, Kit is 27, and they play 15 years old characters. Nobody complains about this. Why complain for Tommen, while we all know he will only have a few lines during the next 2-3 seasons because Cersei will be in charge?
Â 
Moreover, regarding Tommen's one year absence, it's quite convincing if you consider him growing up : http://static2.hypab...es-Chapman1.png

^This. It's like everyone complaining forgot that the original actor also aged after the first season... he's not still like ten, people. He looks the exact same age as the guy they recast, and as it happens he doesn't look pudgy either.
So glad you found this, Eunoch, thank you. I've been wondering all day why there's so much complaining about a /child/ based solely on his looks when he hasn't even gotten to speak a line yet.
4134	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-14	Can anyone find out what Callum Wharry's age is? Only thing I found was from 2010 which reported him as 11, so he would be 14-15 now.
Â 
Chapman is what, 16? It isn't that much of an age-up over Tommen V1.0
4135	Aldi_AA	2014-04-14	I couldn't care less about tommen so long as he has his kittens and they better be black cats like my cat in the my pic.
4136	Russo	2014-04-14	I'm a bit gobsmakced people are complaining about this to be honest.
The character needs to Marry Natalie Dormer, who would be 30 at least. The other young actor would have looked ridiculous.
A sensible move, he still looks young enough.

Â 
He needs to look ridiculous, though. That's the point of their wedding, to highlight how tacky and desperate that shit is.
Â 
But I kinda agree. Since Dormer is older than book!Marge maybe the pairing would looked way too jarring, though we still get to see Craster's and Walder's extremely younger wives
4138	MarieAntoinette	2014-04-15	I know, does it not irritate you though, him and Jaime basically have dark hair and it is the hair that is the give away to the bastardy of Cercei's kids?


Â 
This bugs me more than it should. I'm currently rewatching season 1 and Jaime and Tyrion were blondes back then. I like that they chose a more natural blonde colour for the adult Lannisters, since a lot of blondes get darker with age. But by S4 Jaime's a brunette, and Tyrion's hair keeps changing colour.With all the effort the show takes, it could not have been that hard to keep dying the actors hair.
Â 
New Tommen looks like a teen. But so does Bran, aren't they supposed to be about the same age? If so, then the casting is at least consistent. Since they have cast an older Margaery there is still a visible age difference between them, so I guess that they will still appear as an awkward match.

Â  I do not think Walder and Craster had 10 year old brides around.Â 
Â 
I will advise to watch Borgias S1E6.Â  They had a young teen actor marry an actress many years older and they even had a bedding scene.Â
4141	Ice_and_Fire	2014-04-15	Not surprised that they have aged him up as they have done with pretty much all the children, they really aren't comfortable portraying the ages in the books. I hope he plays it very naive and innocent, the opposite to Joffrey. I look forward to him having some lines in upcoming episodes to see.Â
4142	MyLittleFinger	2014-04-15	Man if I was 16 years old and Natalie Dormer tried to coerce and control me...well needless to say Tommen is a lucky young man Â
4143	Esgar Artikai	2014-04-15	Hmm I'm quite content about the recast. He ressembles the younger actor and looks very Lannisterish, I think. Perhaps he's a bit too old though. He looks like he's around 12-13 years old (the actor is 15 I believe) and I don't see him stamping documents or cuddling kittens like 7-year old Tommen would do. There was one scene I really liked and showed Tommens kindness though. When the dwarves started their play you see Tommen laughing but when he sees Tyrion being not amused he stops laughing immediately. I'll just wait and see how he develops as an actor and character.

The actor has a lot of stage experience for a number of years. I have no doubt he has the chops to carry it off. He played the lead in Billy Elliott for 2 years.
4145	MyLittleDirewolf	2014-04-15	Seven pages on this and the kid hasn't even had a line yet. I don't think he looks *that* old. I'm guessing showTommen is going to be 14ish instead of 10ish. Not a big deal. IDK why they didn't keep the same actor, but whatever. Tommen's mostly in the background anyway. Now if they merge the kittens into one or have him outlaw turnips instead of beets, I'm done with this show!
4146	Raventhal	2014-04-15	He simply could be disinterested king and naive.Â  There are adults who rubber stamped crap.Â  Don't see why a teen still couldn't be tricked.Â  I think he would have to make more demands when his mother was arrested though.
4147	Talking Hodor	2014-04-15	I was kind of hoping for a chubby, younger, even more innocent looking Tommen. For some reason I pictured him as quite plump in the books. I can't remember if he was actually described that way, orÂ if it was just my own creation, but I liked the image of a plump little naAve boy stamping his papers.


Yep, he's plump in the books.Â  Based on his apparent age in the TV show, it looks like he's going to be a LOT different than book Tommen.Â  Probably a lot less childish, hopefully not Joffrey-jerkish.
4148	Talking Hodor	2014-04-15	BTW, has anybody theorized that Tommen could be the valonqar?Â  Murder-suicide anyone?
4149	Red Wedding Cake	2014-04-15	I was hoping they'd keep him ridiculously young for the comic relief. Now what are they going to do with King Tommen and Ser Pounce? Something serious, I'm afraid.
4150	johndance	2014-04-15	They had to age him up for the same reasons they aged up Daenerys, Sansa, and some others. They can't have Margaery Tyrell be engaged to a small child on the show. They couldn't have Khal Drogo marry an actual 13 year old girl among the other things they show him doing to her, and they can't have an actual 14 year old Sansa 'potentially' have a sex scene with Tyrion and a make out session with LF. I mean good grief we haven't even heard him speak yet. They can easily still make him have a personality exactly like he does in the books. They just had to have his appearance look older so it wouldn't be so extremely creepy when you have a 32 year old Natalie Dormer be engaged to an actual 7 year old kid.Â

Â 
And for God's sake, Tommen was a little child three episodes ago. Which wasn't more than half a year even in show-plot time.Â 
Â 
And like this he's not a sweet fat kid, who had his own one-dimensional, but still individual character. Like this, he is a Good-Joffrey.Â
4152	Chebyshov	2014-04-15	Am I the only one who's excited about the potential character changes? A tubby child-king that likes to stamp things is a pretty one dimensional character.

Tommen last apperance was in Blackwater in S2E9. Not in S3 at all and even mention by name again until last week episode.
4154	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-15	The ageing probably came because characters like Bran and Arya are ageing right in front of us, so Tommen has to be roughly in line with them.
Â 
He'll still be a kind-hearted, fairly innocent child, but it'll be interesting to see how the character in the show changes, since as an older presumably teenage boy he'll probably see Margaery in a different sort of light, and he won't be so naive when it comes to other affairs, even if he remains slightly naive.
4155	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-15	Am I the only one who's excited about the potential character changes? A tubby child-king that likes to stamp things is a pretty one dimensional character.


Â 
I know what you mean. He'll still essentially be a decent person and fairly innocent, but being slightly older we might see more of a conflict between him and Cersei, more awareness from him of some of the events, and his relationship with Margaery will be very different too.
4156	RhaenysBalerion	2014-04-15	They had to age him up for the same reasons they aged up Daenerys, Sansa, and some others. They can't have Margaery Tyrell be engaged to a small child on the show.

Â 
That's just fine, aging up the characters. The problem is that they do it absolutely inconsistently. Sansa was 13 in S01E01 and 14 in S03Esomething when Tyrion asked how old she was and 15-6 in S04 according to GoT wiki JOFFREY was 17 in S02-3 when Cersei and Tyrion talk "Remember Jaime at 17?" and according to GoT wiki, he's 19 in S04. Now, Daenerys is 18 in S04 which suggests that Joffrey was born before Robert even became King and married Cersei. Come on... a little bit of consistency, please.Â 
Â 
Btw, Natalie Dormer's Margaery looks no more than 20 and they did that in the Borgias. 10ish kid being married to 25ish woman and the scene was perfectly pulled off. Channeled all the awkwardness and weirdness.Â 
Â 


Tommen last apperance was in Blackwater in S2E9. Not in S3 at all and even mention by name again until last week episode.


Â 
Correct. For some reason I thought Blackwater was S03E09. GoT wiki says he's approx 12 yrs old in S04.Â
4157	TheKitttenGuard	2014-04-15	Am I the only one who's excited about the potential character changes? A tubby child-king that likes to stamp things is a pretty one dimensional character.

 I am interested in what Tommen is going to be.  I personally state one is not too old for kittens.  Other than that I am interested in how they play it.  He been almost consciously left out and do wonder if it comes into play.  He is a child (even if they make him a teen) that is not thought and is now the power of The Kingdom.  He is now going to have all this attention.

Will he? Â He does nothing in the books except get bullied by his mother, it would be a strange decision to expand the character of Tommen, unless the general consensus that he's going to die young is totally wrong, and he will go on to play a more important role later in the story.

They might decide it's a good idea to develop his character a bit so that his eventual death is more meaningful to viewers.

I liked watching his facial expressions during the wedding.


I felt the exact opposite on this one. He seemed kind of smug, almost like Joffrey. I imagined a more shy and uncertain Tommen. TV- Tommen will definitely not have kittens and care Â about outlawing beets.Â

4163	shastada	2014-04-16	Most of my unsullied friends/family didn't even remember Joffrey had a younger brother. Many asked... who's going to be the king now? They really should have had a scene with him introduced in some manner. Maybe providing his brother a gift at the breakfast, and something silly to show his immaturity perhaps.Â
4164	Belisarius09	2014-04-16	I always pictured him being younger and adorable playing with his kittens stamping his papers and hating beets. Â 
Â 
Bu there must have been a reason. Â The replacement must be more competent in delivery of his lines and a better actor. Â Age isn't something impossible to overcome either, I mean look at Sophie Turner, she's much older than Sansa.

I didn't find him smug either.Â  If you notice, he stops smiling at the joust when Tommen sees Tyrion's face.Â  Joffrey would have even smiled more, laughed or made a cutting remark.Â  It was clear that he didn't get the connection between the joust and his Uncle until he saw Tyrion's reaction and then appeared to be sympathetic.Â

4166	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-04-16	I think they didn't emphasize him b/c doing so would have tipped their hand that Joffrey was about to die, especially considering he hadn't been in the show for a long time. To have him just all of a sudden pop-up is a big clue. Â I don't mind that they were subtle about it. Just like not showing Robb legitimizing Jon would have done the same thing. I know when I read it in the book - I knew in that moment that Robb was dying. Â

Right, got that on the rewatch.Â
4168	hugh57	2014-04-16	I suspect that anyone expecting showTommen to outlaw beets and/or be playing with kittens is likely to be disappointed. I believe that Tommen will, instead of being a naive 7 or 8 year old boy, will instead be a naive 12 or 13 year boy. This, of course, means that the writers will have show Tommen's naivete in ways much different that what GRRM did in the books. For example, there may yet be a scene of Tommen stamping documents, though perhaps without the childish glee bookTommen expressed, and scenes where he defies Cersei will be more like a teenager defying his mother.
Â 
I do think that they could have thought of this earlier, and aged Tommen up in the first place, i.e., from Season One. But that's 20/20 hindsight.

Â 
I dont think they really lose anything from aging him up.
Â 
As said above, having him plan a naive innocent boy entering teenage years can take the place of a young boy playing with kittens. it still portays him as a young boy who has largely been unexposed to the nature of the real world and a boy who has been thrust into his position far to early.
Â 
I think this is really just complaining for the sake of complaining.

4171	Inv1ctus	2014-04-17	Lol at people saying Tommen won't be able to pass as a naive little boy because he is 13 and not 9. In what world are you living in? And if we only look at the show we can see some older characters who can get manipulated very easily (Sansa anyone? She freaking betrayed hew own father because of how naive she was. Or maybe Theon, he is supposed to be what like 20 in the books? His turning one way or another like wind, and not to even mention how he got owned by Ramsay in Winterfell). So yeah maybe Tommen won't be playing with cats much, but still doesn't mean his character will be dramatically changed. And really, condemning the change before the guy even spoke a line. Classy.

Re all the viewers who don't know who Tommen is or who don't even realize that Joff had a brother, I saw this exchange at an Unsullied site:
Â 
Â  Who is Tommen?
Â 
He's the little kid you never see who isn't Rickon.
Â 

Â
4174	Newstar	2014-04-19	I didn't find him smug either.Â  If you notice, he stops smiling at the joust when Tommen sees Tyrion's face.Â  Joffrey would have even smiled more, laughed or made a cutting remark.Â  It was clear that he didn't get the connection between the joust and his Uncle until he saw Tyrion's reaction and then appeared to be sympathetic.
Â 
I agree. I don't really get why Tommen laughing at the show is seen to be a strike against him. If he was such a bad seed, he wouldn't have immediately curbed his behaviour in response to Tyrion's displeasure. I can buy that he didn't grok how offensive the show was until he saw Tyrion's face. That makes him clueless, maybe, but not a Joffrey in training.
Â 
I could see an aged-up Tommen being characterized somewhat like Sansa in earlier books: well-meaning, sheltered, eager to please, slightly dim, and very trusting. He would be oblivious to the higher-level maneuvrings and intrigues going on around him and sweetly trusting of the Tyrells. It could work.
Â 
He's the little kid you never see who isn't Rickon.
Â 
Ha! To be fair, the last time we saw Tommen was in 2x09, and he'd said all of ten lines prior to that episode.

4178	Petyr Patter	2014-04-15	So, Joffrey is dead.Â  Time to celebrate, right?Â  No, you probably shouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t.Â  And not for the reasons you think.
Â 
Sure, the Christian thing is to say every death is a tragedy and to murder even your enemies is to sin.Â  But not everyone is Christian and even Christianity realizes to protect life sometimes one must take life.Â 
Â 
You should be sad because Joffrey was murdered, which is the opposite of justice.Â  And the lack of justice in Westeros is the real tragedy.Â  Indeed, the immediate aftermath of his murder was an accusation and an arrest.Â  If Tyrion is guilty, then he may be punished for killing Joffrey.Â  If he is innocent, even worse the death of Joffrey is costing him his freedom and quite possibly his life.
Â 
The show almost began with an act of justice.Â  Eddardâ<U+0080><U+0099>s men found a deserter of the Nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Watch, which is a capital crime.Â  Eddard questions the man and finds him guilty of desertion.Â  In front of witnesses, he explains his authority, let the accused have his last words, and then swings the sword.
Â 
Currently, no one knows why Joffrey is dead.Â  It is an act of violence at a time when violence and greed has become common.Â  There was no recounting of his crimes, no one announcing his or her authority to carry out the sentence.Â  Instead, we are going to see the apparatus of justice used to punish his presumed killer and legitimize his cruelty and reign.
Â 
Worse, the poisoner probably ate at the wedding feast.Â  Meaning he or she was a guest.Â  Why is this important?Â  Because of the great social law which forbids guests and hosts from harming each otherâ<U+0080>¦ the very same law Robb Stark depended upon for his safety at the Twins.Â  Are we to cry for the treachery that killed Robb and yet cheer it for Joffrey?
Â 
And ultimately, nothing in Westeros has changed for the better.Â  Joffreyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s younger brother and Cerseiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s youngest child Tommen is going to quickly be crowned king.Â  Tywin Lannister will continue to rule as Hand while the Boltons continue to rule in the North as a reward for betraying the Starks.Â  The Greyjoys continue to hold the rest of the North and the Riverlands continue to be devastated by kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s men like Polliver.Â  Bran, Rickon, and Arya remain as homeless refugees who are fleeing for their lives, and now because of Joffreyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s death it appears Sansa will be joining them.
Â 
While cheering a well-deserved death is cathartic for the mind, it isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t for the people who still have to live in Westeros.

Â 
Celebrations of Joffrey's death in the show are tempered by the make-up and CGI showing how terrible it was. This was also demonstrated in the books by the throat tearing. The reader/viewer is lead into the situation where they can celebrate his demise but such emotion is balanced by feelings of discomfort.
Â 


Â 
Â 
You should be sad because Joffrey was murdered, which is the opposite of justice. Â

Â 
You are right about most of this, however, I disagree with many of your conclusions.
Â 
1) Are you talking about justice or about legality? Those two are not necessarily the same. What is legal may not necessarily be just. Was Ned Stark beheading the NW ranger who ran away because he was terrified after having seen the White Walkers murder his companions justice? Ned certainly thought it was, but did the man really deserve death? I don't think so.
Â 
Is deserting the NW really such a terrible crime that it merits death, as opposed to a lot of other crimes (including murder and rape) which aren't deemed as serious and can result in the perpetrator being forced to join the NW (an organization that some people join of their own free will)? I don't think so, either. Even Ned Stark didn't seem to think so. He didn't argue to Bran that the man deserved death, he argued that death penalty was necessary because a man who deserts the NW would be very dangerous, because he's in a desperate situation. But he's only in a desperate situation because a deserter gets a death penalty according to the law. What Ned did was enforce the law, not enforce justice.
Â 
Between that death, and Joffrey being murdered at his wedding, I'd argue that the latter is much closer to justice, because Joffrey deserved a death sentence much more than the NW ranger did. Even if the murderer was not motivated by the desire to bring him to justice, Joffrey was probably murdered because of the kind of person he is and the kind of things he does.
Â 
2) If a murder were the opposite of justice, are state executions the opposite of justice? Is state-sanctioned murder that much better than individual murder - say, a murder one done by someone who wishes to punish the guilty or remove a dangerous person from a position of power/capability to do further harm? (For instance, Arya killing Polliver.) The obvious answer is that it's better because it maintains law and order, while something like a vigilante or revenge kill does the opposite. But that, again, is a matter of law and order, not justice. The state/its regime and judiciary can also be corrupt, murderous and unjust, and even if it is not, there may be failure of justice - people who are executed or otherwise punished may actually be innocent, or the judge may be prejudiced and give them a much harsher sentence than they deserve.
Â 
(To use an ASOAIF/GoT example, the execution of Ned Stark was legal [inasmuch as one recognizes Joffrey as the king, but Joffrey himself had no idea he may not be legitimate], because Joffrey was the king and had the authority to order it. The executions of Ned's father and brother at the order of the Mad King Aerys were definitely legal, because he had the authority to order it under the laws of the Seven Kingdoms [and nobody even questioned his legitimacy as the hereditary monarch]. So, does that mean that those were examples of justice, while Joffrey's murder or the murder of the Mad King were examples of injustice?)
Â 
When it comes down to it, the motivations of Joffrey's murderer are likely to be very similar to the motivations of the state in executing criminals: either justice, or - more likely - the practical motive of removing of a dangerous person from the stage and making it impossible for them to do any further harm.
Â 
3) Good luck with getting legal justice in Westeros. It should be pretty clear at this point that it's extremely unlikely to happen to regarding most of the crimes committed by powerful people (which includes pretty much everything done by Tywin, Joffrey, Roose Bolton, Walder Frey etc.), or people who operate in the state of chaos (like the Mountain, Polliver, and other people committing horrible crimes in war-ravaged Riverlands). Most of the time, only way to have the perpetrators punished for what they've done and to make them incapable of doing any more harm is, well, to murder them illegally. Since the alternative is to let them get away with it and keep doing the same, I'll take the murder, gladly, and be happy about it.
Â 
4) The third reason that motivates the legal punishments, an attempt to show an example and deter further wrongdoings by other people who may follow the example, realizing that you can get away with it, also applies in this case, even though it may not have been the motivation of Joffrey's murderer. The deaths of Aerys II and Joffrey show that you can't get away with being a complete douche and committing crimes left and right just because you are a king, and that your absolute power is not enough to protect you. The fate of Aerys II was used by Tyrion as an example for Joffrey, and while it didn't help, the deaths of Aerys II and Joffrey can have the same effect.
Â 
5) Yes, guest right doesn't mean what it used to. But, in a way, that can be seen as an example of karmic justice and a warning: you shall reap what you sow. If you break the rules and commit a horrible crime, consequences will follow and others will use the same against you. That's maybe not entirely applicable here since Joffrey was not involved in the RW, but if we look at Joffrey's murder as a strike against the Lannisters, it shows that Tywin was dead wrong when he gave his (bullshit) justification of the RW and the reasons why it's supposedly good for the realm.
Â 
6)Â  You are right that Joffrey's death does not change that much in terms of the Lannister power structure. I would much rather have Tywin Lannister murdered, if I had to choose, since he is actually crucial for the Lannister power structure (and is also responsible for many more crimes than Joffrey, but that's another matter).
Â 
You are also right that Joffrey's death results in a bad consequence of Tyrion, who's probably innocent, getting wrongfully arrested and possibly convicted/executed.
Â 
But on the other hand... if one is hoping that a power structure built on treachery and murder, such as the Lannister power, will collapse - and I certainly am - then something that severely destabilizes the Lannister power structure is a good thing, and there's no doubt that Joffrey's murder and the resulting tensions stemming from the lack of knowledge about the idendity of the murderer (including Tyrion's arrest) will do just that.
Â 
7) Becoming a homeless refugee fleeing for her life is a considerable improvement of circumstances for Sansa, compared to what she was before, i.e. a powerless captive forcibly married into the family who murdered most of her family. Sansa herself would most likely agree, since she's been dreaming of getting away from the Lannisters since her father's beheading (and, in the books, had actually been planning to do so, since she had offers, which the show had decided to deny her).
Â 
In short:Â  there are actually quite a few reasons to feel happy because of Joffrey's murder (some of them purely practical), even though there are also other reasons to feel concerned about it.

(To use an ASOAIF/GoT example, the execution of Ned Stark was legal [inasmuch as one recognizes Joffrey as the king, but Joffrey himself had no idea he may not be legitimate], because Joffrey was the king and had the authority to order it. The executions of Ned's father and brother at the order of the Mad King Aerys were definitely legal, because he had the authority to order it under the laws of the Seven Kingdoms [and nobody even questioned his legitimacy as the hereditary monarch]. So, does that mean that those were examples of justice, while Joffrey's murder or the murder of the Mad King were examples of injustice?)
Â 
When it comes down to it, the motivations of Joffrey's murderer are likely to be very similar to the motivations of the state in executing criminals: either justice, or - more likely - the practical motive of removing of a dangerous person from the stage and making it impossible for them to do any further harm.
Â 
3) Good luck with getting legal justice in Westeros. It should be pretty clear at this point that it's extremely unlikely to happen to regarding most of the crimes committed by powerful people (which includes pretty much everything done by Tywin, Joffrey, Roose Bolton, Walder Frey etc.), or people who operate in the state of chaos (like the Mountain, Polliver, and other people committing horrible crimes in war-ravaged Riverlands). Most of the time, only way to have the perpetrators punished for what they've done and to make them incapable of doing any more harm is, well, to murder them illegally. Since the alternative is to let them get away with it and keep doing the same, I'll take the murder, gladly, and be happy about it.
Â 
4) The third reason that motivates the legal punishments, an attempt to show an example and deter further wrongdoings by other people who may follow the example, realizing that you can get away with it, also applies in this case, even though it may not have been the motivation of Joffrey's murderer. The deaths of Aerys II and Joffrey show that you can't get away with being a complete douche and committing crimes left and right just because you are a king, and that your absolute power is not enough to protect you. The fate of Aerys II was used by Tyrion as an example for Joffrey, and while it didn't help, the deaths of Aerys II and Joffrey can have the same effect.
Â 
5) Yes, guest right doesn't mean what it used to. But, in a way, that can be seen as an example of karmic justice and a warning: you shall reap what you sow. If you break the rules and commit a horrible crime, consequences will follow and others will use the same against you. That's maybe not entirely applicable here since Joffrey was not involved in the RW, but if we look at Joffrey's murder as a strike against the Lannisters, it shows that Tywin was dead wrong when he gave his (bullshit) justification of the RW and the reasons why it's supposedly good for the realm.
Â 
6)Â  You are right that Joffrey's death does not change that much in terms of the Lannister power structure. I would much rather have Tywin Lannister murdered, if I had to choose, since he is actually crucial for the Lannister power structure (and is also responsible for many more crimes than Joffrey, but that's another matter).
Â 
You are also right that Joffrey's death results in a bad consequence of Tyrion, who's probably innocent, getting wrongfully arrested and possibly convicted/executed.
Â 
But on the other hand... if one is hoping that a power structure built on treachery and murder, such as the Lannister power, will collapse - and I certainly am - then something that severely destabilizes the Lannister power structure is a good thing, and there's no doubt that Joffrey's murder and the resulting tensions stemming from the lack of knowledge about the idendity of the murderer (including Tyrion's arrest) will do just that.
Â 
7) Becoming a homeless refugee fleeing for her life is a considerable improvement of circumstances for Sansa, compared to what she was before, i.e. a powerless captive forcibly married into the family who murdered most of her family. Sansa herself would most likely agree, since she's been dreaming of getting away from the Lannisters since her father's beheading (and, in the books, had actually been planning to do so, since she had offers, which the show had decided to deny her).
Â 
In short:Â  there are actually quite a few reasons to feel happy because of Joffrey's murder (some of them purely practical), even though there are also other reasons to feel concerned about it.


Â 
  Â Very much agree. I was going to make the same point about Joff and the deserter myself.Â 
My only, very minor quibble, is that although Joff was not personally responsible for the RW it was done in his name and he did not complain about it, furthermore he has benefitted politically and personally (new sword) from it, so, to an extent, he is also culpable.
Â 
The difference between justice and legality can be discussed until the cows come home, however, it is noticeable in almost any epoch and any place that the powerful and well-off are much less liable to feel the full rigours of the law, even if they deserve it, than the poor and dispossessed. Sometimes subterfuge, rebellion and, yeah, murder are the only ways in which they can be made to pay.
Â 
RIP Joff, you won't be missed.

Â 
So, I'm back to celebrating (and rewatching soon, for the fun), and anyone who'd like to do the same is welcome to come dance with me.Â  ~This board could use a good dancing emoticon~
4189	XTwipz	2014-04-16	Robb Starks was fighting for freedom, for a better place to live in. He was against the terror that Joffrey instigating. Yes, I agree, Robb had killed too, it is a war and many people are going to die. But Joffrey's death had something more. Look, even Tywin and Cersei were agree about Joffrey. He was doing what he wanted, without thinking of consequences. He was a really bad king, worst than Robert.
4190	GHOSTSTARK	2014-04-16	the Lannister had their hand in on Robb Stark. it wasnt just the Frey who broke the guest right. the Lannisters are right there with them and anything that came to them is what they deserve.
4191	SeventySeven	2014-04-16	I'm not celebrating because Joffrey dying 
	Spoiler puts Sansa in the hands of Pedofinger and has her accused of a murder she did not commit, Tyrion ends up jailed and he's also not responsible, and the kingdom is now in Cersei's hands. Mind you, not that the situation before was optimal, but it is a case of getting worse.
 Everything else, meh. He was a kid though, so I don't rejoice.
Â 
ETA: someone pointed out to me I forgot to put some stuff under spoilers, soz! It's fixed now.

4195	JoramunsKazoo	2014-04-16	Joffery was a vile psychopath and needed to be eradicated.Â  I do not celebrate a murder; I simply say good riddance to a cancer.
4196	Petyr Patter	2014-04-16	@Anarra Snow - Your reply is to big for me to quote around, but here are some quick bullet points.
Justice is not the same thing as legal.Â  However, legality provides an important framework for pursuing justice.Â  Otherwise, "an eye for an eye and the whole world goes blind." - Gandhi.Â 
The use of legal apparatus to punish the innocent (Eddard) and keep the guilty in power (Tywin, Joffrey) is the greater tragedy than Joffrey being king.Â  For example, consider Polliver, the "king's man" we saw at the end of episode 1 robbing an inn and about to rape the wife or daughter of the innkeep.Â  It seems very clear to me he's built up a bigger body count than Joffrey.Â  And with Joffrey gone... Polliver and the hundreds like still roaming the realm are still "king's men" and are still free of retribution.
Justice is requires a few elements.Â  Acknowledgement of crimes is one.Â  Had Arya shown up in Joffrey's chambers and declared "you killed my father prepare to die," I would have cheered.Â  As it is, Joffrey's death is a mystery.
Desertion from the military has historically been a capital offense.Â  It almost needs to be to maintain order.Â  Regardless, the deserter knew the penalty and abandon the Wall and weakening the defense of the Realm he was sworn to protect.Â  Maybe death for a first offense is to harsh, but everyone knows the penalty and his guilty was not in doubt.
Having read the books and knowing who and more importantly why Joffrey was murdered has colored my perception of the event.Â  Suffice it to say, unless you think Tyrion was actually guilty, Joffrey in dying may do more harm than good.
I disagree about Sansa.Â  She was actually in safe place with Tyrion, although certainly not a loving place.Â  Tyrion cared about her welfare and viewed it as his duty to protect her.Â  Now... well, her fate is in unknown.Â  I will say Dontos the former drunk knight and currently drunk fool is a far less effective protector than Sandor Clegane is to Arya.Â 
Â 


This seems like some butthurt Joffrey fan, like now suddenly in places like tumblr they're crying that he wasn't so bad, he was so misunderstood, blah blah blah.
Â

Uh, I say nothing of the sort.Â  Joffrey was exactly what he appeared to be.Â 
Â 


SPOILER


Â 
Psst.Â  This is a non-spoiler thread.Â  If you could edit your post that would be beneficial.Â  Though you are on to a reason why I'm saying Joffrey's death is more bad than good.Â  Or rather the manner of his death.Â 
Â

Â 
See, you think the world have been made better.Â  I disagree.Â  He died blaming an uncle who may or may not be guilty, and thinking he was right that his uncle was a terrible person who he was right to marginalize.Â  And the world is made darker by Tyrion in jail, one of the few people who wanted to make the realm a better place.
Â 
I agree a trial isn't necessary, but it would have been nice.Â  What is necessary is some sort of public acknowledgement that Joffrey died for his crimes.Â  Not, because his uncle hated him, which is now the working theory.
Â 


It's a monarchy, so the choices are a bit limited to all out rebellion or murder. This is not very different from Jaime slaying Aerys, and I think the books cover the moral greyness associated with making such choices.Â 


Â 
The nice thing about Jaime killing Aerys is he OWNED the fact he did it.Â  No one is stepping forward to say "I killed Joffrey." Now, if only Jaime's pride hadn't stopped him from explaining why he did it, he might actually have developed a positive reputation.Â  Instead, everyone assumes he did so because the war was lost and it was a way for the Lannisters to prove their loyalty to the new Robert Baratheon led powerblock.Â
4197	TheFullmetalAlchemist	2014-04-16	I found Joffrey to be entertaining in the books and the show. I dont get why everybody is so happy about it. For me when it comes to entertainment, I value entertaining characters over moral ones. Yet so many people seem to value the latter more.Â
4198	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-04-16	I don't think the defense that it's ok to murder someone as long as you own up to it is very strong.
4199	aceluby	2014-04-16	Whoever did murder Joffrey could still get what's coming to them eventually.Â  You are right that this is another example of guest right being broken for political purposes.Â  But that doesn't mean he didn't deserve it.Â  And the comparisons between him and Robb end at that they were both murdered at a wedding.Â  Other than that the two deaths are nowhere near the same.Â  Joff was a monster with no friends and all enemies.
4200	Annara Snow	2014-04-16	I disagree about Sansa.Â  She was actually in safe place with Tyrion, although certainly not a loving place.Â  Tyrion cared about her welfare and viewed it as his duty to protect her.Â  Now... well, her fate is in unknown.Â  I will say Dontos the former drunk knight and currently drunk fool is a far less effective protector than Sandor Clegane is to Arya.Â 


Â 
  She'd be safer anywhere else. King's Landing is the least safe place in the world for her, not to mention the worst for her emotional well-being. Tyrion can't even protect himself well enough, and he's one of the Lannisters. Being Tyrion's legal wife only makes her even more of a target for Joffrey and potentially Cersei, and Tywin is not the type to be patient for long with Tyrion not putting a baby in her belly and not producing a little Lannister heir to the Winterfell. And even if Tyrion was such a white knight, powerful enough to keep himself and Sansa safe, and entirely free of influence of his powerful and dominant father, Sansa would have always remained a passive, helpless pawn who's utterly dependent on Tyrion's good will, not to mention surrounded by the people who murdered most of her family and forced to sit and act like she's one of them while they're rubbing salt on the wounds.
Â 
If Tyrion really cares so much about her well-being, he should have tried to get her far away from King's Landing and his family, and have their forced marriage annulled.
Â

4201	Fool of a Book	2014-04-16	There is no indication in the books that either Joff or anyone implicated in his death (no spoilers) is religious, or has previously acted morally in any sense of the word in order for this act to be a conflict. Â The only "moral" person who could be implicated is Sansa. Â That this distinction does not matter regarding the sins of "guest right" is what moves the plot along, but we don't have enough information how this matters to the gears that grind GRRM's world.

Sorry OP, but I'm confused. Â Unless you shine the same moral spyglass on every single death in ASOIAF, this argument falls flat.

4204	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-04-16	The OP is trying to applyÂ our real world system of justice and law enforcement to Westeros, which we can't do. There is no systematic way to remove an unjust King. No papers to file. No petitions to be made. No due process. If Joffrey wants to have every woman in King's Landing raped daily, he can. At least according to the 'rules' of Westeros. In their world, until an amendment is made to their core rules regarding the status of Kings, there is little recourse to end the rule of an evilÂ and unjust King aside from acts of murderous treason. Given the context of their world, murdering that type of King is actually a just and morally correct thing to do, in my opinion. To view it as an immoral act of murder is just viewing through the coke bottle glasses of our own modernÂ society.

Justice is requires a few elements.Â  Acknowledgement of crimes is one.Â  Had Arya shown up in Joffrey's chambers and declared "you killed my father prepare to die," I would have cheered.Â  As it is, Joffrey's death is a mystery.


Â 
I've read all your arguments in this debate and find myself asking at the end: "So what would have been a 'justified' death for Joffrey?"Â In the line I quoted you on, you feel Arya showing up to exact justice against Joffrey would be ok. But like Oberyn's threats to avenge his sister's murder - is this 'justice' or 'vengeance?' ...fine line there. Tricky.
Â 
Ok - so ... AreÂ justification and justice even comparable regardless of having the same root word? No, you probably would say not. That's the sticky point of this debate. One might feel 'justified' to take the life of another ... but that's not the same as 'justice' - which as you already discussed, seems to imply law and order. But law and order is defined by the people who make those laws and enact the established order. The rules of Dothraki culture (and coincidentally the acceptance of death at a wedding) are obviously vastly different than the rules in Westeros culture - but still - they make their laws and order and they view it as justice or not.Â 
Â 
Joffrey's murderer felt justified in killing him for a number of reasons some of which are blatantly obvious and others which are maybe not so apparent yet.Â 
Â 
I do agree the Westeros standard of providing safety to guests at a wedding has been grievously disregarded on two occasions now. I disagree however that we should feel as outraged about it over Joffrey's death as we did Robb Stark's. The circumstances of the muderer's motivations are vastly different and there's just no way around it - Joffrey deserved it and Robb did not. As Sansa confessed, Joffrey was a monster. He would have grown worse as he matured, this is almost guaranteed. The atrocities and sadistic things he's done up to this point were inexcusable and horrific. Yes, I believe some people deserve to die more than others. That's it's own form of justice when it does happen.

4209	flamingothegreen	2014-04-16	I'm not celebrating that Joffrey is dead but I am by no means upset about it.
He was a good character - a love-to-hate type that will leave a hole for someone else to fill. I'll miss Joffrey, but he's someone that inevitably had to go.
Â 
Anyway, with the justice issue - is it just or injust? It's certainly not legal and it's definitely disrespectful to do something to the host when you are a guest, but that did not make it injust. Does Joffrey deserve to die? Maybe, maybe not. However, it is not for us to judge whether he deserves to die or not, but moreso it would be the decision of those from the realm. How many characters thought Joffrey's death would be just? In times like that, it probably would be just to kill Joffrey due to the things that he did (things that could be considered legal since he was king). However, I don't think we can view his death while regarding justiceÂ at the same time; if you do that, then you would need to take into consideration every act done by every character, "good" or "bad", and determine whether or not said actions are just or not. I understand where you're coming from regarding your conclusions, however I don't agree with them.
Â 
Also, Joffrey's death should have both positive and negative repercussions, as would any king's death. We can clearly see that Tyrion isÂ in a horrible position, Cersei is distressed, Sansa is supposedly on the run (which isn't necessarily bad), and many many people are going to be happy. o: Not everything will be bad for characters, and some will definitely get some good out of Joffrey's death.

Â 

	Spoiler It's not justice. He wasn't killed for any crime he committed. He was killed so the Tyrells could get more power. Just because someone is awful person doesn't mean that they cannot be a victim. Nor does it their murderer "just." Joffery totally deserved to die. But it doesn't make his death "just" or the Tyrells (at least those who knew/took part in it) any better for it.

Â I agree. In this context, it isn't really so much about the act being 'just' as it is about the act being a good one. Just and Good overlap but not inclusively. If Joffrey was walking through the castle and a random stone fell from the ceiling and killed him it wouldn't be 'just', because you can't call a random accident 'justice'. But it still could be called 'good' depending on your viewpoint because it may prevent years and years of senseless violence and cruelty and murder. Similarly, what happened at the wedding wasn't necessarily a just act, but it was a good one.
4212	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-16	Â 
You should be sad because Joffrey was murdered, which is the opposite of justice. Â 

I should not be sad a tyrant and a psychotic little bleeder is dead. I am not Christian so im not going to do the "decent Christian thing" when vengeance should be wrought. What i am sad about? That the people who deserved their vengeance on Joffrey the most, werent the ones who destroyed him. There is little honor in Joff's death, but that doesnt mean its any less satisfying to people like Sansa who had lost so much due to this little bastard.Â 
Vengeance is sweet.
Karma is often sweeter.Â

Deal with it.  And do not tell me how i should feel about my fictional entertainment. Thats icky and intrusive.

If it were, then the Freys would not be expected to uphold it in the first place. Guest right is considered sacred throughout Westeros.
Â 
Â 
You are right about most of this, however, I disagree with many of your conclusions.
Â 
1) Are you talking about justice or about legality? Those two are not necessarily the same. What is legal may not necessarily be just. Was Ned Stark beheading the NW ranger who ran away because he was terrified after having seen the White Walkers murder his companions justice? Ned certainly thought it was, but did the man really deserve death? I don't think so.
Â 
Is deserting the NW really such a terrible crime that it merits death, as opposed to a lot of other crimes (including murder and rape) which aren't deemed as serious and can result in the perpetrator being forced to join the NW (an organization that some people join of their own free will)? I don't think so, either. Even Ned Stark didn't seem to think so. He didn't argue to Bran that the man deserved death, he argued that death penalty was necessary because a man who deserts the NW would be very dangerous, because he's in a desperate situation. But he's only in a desperate situation because a deserter gets a death penalty according to the law. What Ned did was enforce the law, not enforce justice.
Â 
Between that death, and Joffrey being murdered at his wedding, I'd argue that the latter is much closer to justice, because Joffrey deserved a death sentence much more than the NW ranger did. Even if the murderer was not motivated by the desire to bring him to justice, Joffrey was probably murdered because of the kind of person he is and the kind of things he does.
Â 
2) If a murder were the opposite of justice, are state executions the opposite of justice? Is state-sanctioned murder that much better than individual murder - say, a murder one done by someone who wishes to punish the guilty or remove a dangerous person from a position of power/capability to do further harm? (For instance, Arya killing Polliver.) The obvious answer is that it's better because it maintains law and order, while something like a vigilante or revenge kill does the opposite. But that, again, is a matter of law and order, not justice. The state/its regime and judiciary can also be corrupt, murderous and unjust, and even if it is not, there may be failure of justice - people who are executed or otherwise punished may actually be innocent, or the judge may be prejudiced and give them a much harsher sentence than they deserve.
Â 
(To use an ASOAIF/GoT example, the execution of Ned Stark was legal [inasmuch as one recognizes Joffrey as the king, but Joffrey himself had no idea he may not be legitimate], because Joffrey was the king and had the authority to order it. The executions of Ned's father and brother at the order of the Mad King Aerys were definitely legal, because he had the authority to order it under the laws of the Seven Kingdoms [and nobody even questioned his legitimacy as the hereditary monarch]. So, does that mean that those were examples of justice, while Joffrey's murder or the murder of the Mad King were examples of injustice?)
Â 
When it comes down to it, the motivations of Joffrey's murderer are likely to be very similar to the motivations of the state in executing criminals: either justice, or - more likely - the practical motive of removing of a dangerous person from the stage and making it impossible for them to do any further harm.
Â 
3) Good luck with getting legal justice in Westeros. It should be pretty clear at this point that it's extremely unlikely to happen to regarding most of the crimes committed by powerful people (which includes pretty much everything done by Tywin, Joffrey, Roose Bolton, Walder Frey etc.), or people who operate in the state of chaos (like the Mountain, Polliver, and other people committing horrible crimes in war-ravaged Riverlands). Most of the time, only way to have the perpetrators punished for what they've done and to make them incapable of doing any more harm is, well, to murder them illegally. Since the alternative is to let them get away with it and keep doing the same, I'll take the murder, gladly, and be happy about it.
Â 
4) The third reason that motivates the legal punishments, an attempt to show an example and deter further wrongdoings by other people who may follow the example, realizing that you can get away with it, also applies in this case, even though it may not have been the motivation of Joffrey's murderer. The deaths of Aerys II and Joffrey show that you can't get away with being a complete douche and committing crimes left and right just because you are a king, and that your absolute power is not enough to protect you. The fate of Aerys II was used by Tyrion as an example for Joffrey, and while it didn't help, the deaths of Aerys II and Joffrey can have the same effect.
Â 
5) Yes, guest right doesn't mean what it used to. But, in a way, that can be seen as an example of karmic justice and a warning: you shall reap what you sow. If you break the rules and commit a horrible crime, consequences will follow and others will use the same against you. That's maybe not entirely applicable here since Joffrey was not involved in the RW, but if we look at Joffrey's murder as a strike against the Lannisters, it shows that Tywin was dead wrong when he gave his (bullshit) justification of the RW and the reasons why it's supposedly good for the realm.
Â 
6)Â  You are right that Joffrey's death does not change that much in terms of the Lannister power structure. I would much rather have Tywin Lannister murdered, if I had to choose, since he is actually crucial for the Lannister power structure (and is also responsible for many more crimes than Joffrey, but that's another matter).
Â 
You are also right that Joffrey's death results in a bad consequence of Tyrion, who's probably innocent, getting wrongfully arrested and possibly convicted/executed.
Â 
But on the other hand... if one is hoping that a power structure built on treachery and murder, such as the Lannister power, will collapse - and I certainly am - then something that severely destabilizes the Lannister power structure is a good thing, and there's no doubt that Joffrey's murder and the resulting tensions stemming from the lack of knowledge about the idendity of the murderer (including Tyrion's arrest) will do just that.
Â 
7) Becoming a homeless refugee fleeing for her life is a considerable improvement of circumstances for Sansa, compared to what she was before, i.e. a powerless captive forcibly married into the family who murdered most of her family. Sansa herself would most likely agree, since she's been dreaming of getting away from the Lannisters since her father's beheading (and, in the books, had actually been planning to do so, since she had offers, which the show had decided to deny her).
Â 
In short:Â  there are actually quite a few reasons to feel happy because of Joffrey's murder (some of them purely practical), even though there are also other reasons to feel concerned about it.

My. God. Where have you been all my life?
4214	Beric175	2014-04-18	It's an ugly situation overall.
Â 
Fact 1) Joffrey's a cowardly, petty tyrant who enjoys cruelty and always wants to get his way.
Fact 2) Joffrey's a scared boy dying in his mother's arms without understanding the why or what of whatÂ is happening to him at that moment.
Fact 3) Guest right applies to the host as well as the guests (see Craster).
Â 
So yeah, actually lots of reasons to be conflicted about this. Me being a strong believer in human dignity I cannotÂ enjoy other people engaging in base instincts by celebrating the murder of a child. Your culture and your engagement with it indicates something about you as an individual and even if on the surface it feels satisfying, it should not be because Martin is trying to tell you that the best way to deal with tragedy is to take it and get over it (like Sansa does), yet most viewers have this thirst for revenge for past injuries inflictedÂ on their favourite characters built up for 3 seasonsÂ now (the Arya-types). I don't think going mad with revenge like Arya does is the appropriate response to a hard life, if anything it showsÂ her psychological weakness, as opposed to Sansa whoÂ has been dealt a rough enough handÂ as well (getting constantly abused, mocked and nearly getting raped) and yet she holds it together and keeps her humanity, as opposed to Arya who's so willing to throw it all away so easily.
Â 
I will end by saying that i'm not happy aboutÂ Joffrey dying as a person because thatÂ tyrant was also still a vulnerable human being endowed with human dignity and so I will not be jumping up and down on his grave anytime soon. Nor will I pretend that it was a great loss for anyone other but Cersei to whom my sympathy went at the moment of Joffrey's death. Overall, it was an ugly individual dying in an ugly way, showing us all the ugliness beneath the surface of his demeanour before and as he was dying,Â leading to an even uglier situation going forward, whilst showing to us the ugly mentality of some of the viewers. Thus is the nature of the Purple Wedding.Â Â

4215	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-18	Is there a source from the texts that implies that a guest harming his host carries the same taboo as a host harming his guest? It doesn't change my stance on this issue, but I was just wondering. I don't remember reading that anywhere.


Guest right Â goes both ways.
4216	TheWanderer	2014-04-18	Unfortunately, most of what I have to say is spoilers (though careful watchers might have a big clue):
Â 

	Spoiler It's not justice. He wasn't killed for any crime he committed. He was killed so the Tyrells could get more power. Just because someone is awful person doesn't mean that they cannot be a victim. Nor does it their murderer "just." Joffery totally deserved to die. But it doesn't make his death "just" or the Tyrells (at least those who knew/took part in it) any better for it.



Â 

	Spoiler I don't think that is the Tyrells motivation because it's not really true. 1) Margery is only Queen if Joffery is King OR if they can get her engaged to Tommen. While it is very likely that Margery would be engaged to Tommen following Joffery's death it is far from guaranteed, especially as Tywin no longer really needs their help and Cersei hates them. 2) Tywin is the real power behind Joffery's throne, this only becomes more true with Tommen king since Tommen is even younger.Â 
Â 
They really seem to be more concerned with the danger Joffery poses to Margery than anything else (especially given the conversation they had with Sansa in the show).

Â 


Guest right Â goes both ways.


Â 
But does it actually apply here?
Â 
They're not in his home, they're not staying in his home, he hasn't given them bread and salt and wouldn't be expected to give them guest gifts when they leave. I don't think just having people to an event automatically qualifies them as your guest, I don't even think having people in your home automatically qualifies them as your guest (else Joffery broke it rather badly when he had that singers tongue removed). I honestly don't think Joffery's murder can be considered a violation of guest right, which is probably why no one (in universe) does.
4217	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-04-18	Guest right Â goes both ways.


Â That may be, but I'm wondering where in the text it actually states this. I'm just interested to see it.
4218	Dudu42	2014-04-18	So, Joffrey is dead.Â  Time to celebrate, right?Â  No, you probably shouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t.Â  And not for the reasons you think.
Â 
Sure, the Christian thing is to say every death is a tragedy and to murder even your enemies is to sin.Â  But not everyone is Christian and even Christianity realizes to protect life sometimes one must take life.Â 


Â 
The Christian thing would only make sense in a Christian environment. So, this point isn't so relevant.
Â 

You should be sad because Joffrey was murdered, which is the opposite of justice.Â  And the lack of justice in Westeros is the real tragedy.Â  Indeed, the immediate aftermath of his murder was an accusation and an arrest.Â  If Tyrion is guilty, then he may be punished for killing Joffrey.Â  If he is innocent, even worse the death of Joffrey is costing him his freedom and quite possibly his life.
Â 
The show almost began with an act of justice.Â  Eddardâ<U+0080><U+0099>s men found a deserter of the Nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Watch, which is a capital crime.Â  Eddard questions the man and finds him guilty of desertion.Â  In front of witnesses, he explains his authority, let the accused have his last words, and then swings the sword.
Â 
Currently, no one knows why Joffrey is dead.Â  It is an act of violence at a time when violence and greed has become common.Â  There was no recounting of his crimes, no one announcing his or her authority to carry out the sentence.Â  Instead, we are going to see the apparatus of justice used to punish his presumed killer and legitimize his cruelty and reign.
Â 

Â 
This is a tragedy, yes. Innocent people will pay. I just wonder if Joffrey staying in the throne was a bigger tragedy. I think it probably is, but then again, conjectures...
Â 

Worse, the poisoner probably ate at the wedding feast.Â  Meaning he or she wasÂ a guest.Â  Why is this important?Â  Because of the great social law which forbids guests and hosts from harming each otherâ<U+0080>¦ the very same law Robb Stark depended upon for his safety at the Twins.Â  Are we to cry for the treachery that killed Robb and yet cheer it for Joffrey?
Â 
And ultimately, nothing in Westeros has changed for the better.Â  Joffreyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s younger brother and Cerseiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s youngest child Tommen is going to quickly be crowned king.Â  Tywin Lannister will continue to rule as Hand while the Boltons continue to rule in the North as a reward for betraying the Starks.Â  The Greyjoys continue to hold the rest of the North and the Riverlands continue to be devastated by kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s men like Polliver.Â  Bran, Rickon, and Arya remain as homeless refugees who are fleeing for their lives, and now because of Joffreyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s death it appears Sansa will be joining them.
Â 
While cheering a well-deserved death is cathartic for the mind, it isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t for the people who still have to live in Westeros.
Â 

Â 
All the talk about justice and law seems to me a bit of secondary. What about freeing Westeros from a completely sociopath ruler? Isn't that a good reason to cheer?
Â 
And I see some posters arguing that cheering about the death of a child is simply wrong? But really, if you could describe Joffrey in a single word, would you choose "child"? Why not "jerk", "murderer" or the one I just used, "sociopath"?
The fact Westeros had such king in throne had to be adressed. If not by murdering him, then how? I think whoever had the balls to plan and execute Joffrey's assassination did a favor to Westeros. Of course this will lend to a lot of unfortunate outcomes, but someone had to kill that kid, he was a cancer.
Â 
Even if that somehow end up making Lannister's power stronger it was, in the end a good thing. And I honestly believe it'll actually make their power stronger. One of the reason the whole North entered in war was Ned's beheading, an order from Joffrey, not Tywin. Sure, that made Lannister presence weaker since they acquired so much more enemies, but it was overall harmful to Westeros, since it was plagued by a gruesome war.
4219	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-18	Â That may be, but I'm wondering where in the text it actually states this. I'm just interested to see it.


I looked it up on the Wiki and it cited a Jon ASOS chapter, so i'm guess it's stated in the book right there.

I honestly don't think Joffery's murder can be considered a violation of guest right, which is probably why no one (in universe) does.


I don't think Joffrey was breaking guest right, since he was there to sentence, since the singer was not there as a guest, but as Â  someone who had been caught committing a crime.
Â 
I don't think that Guest Right really applies to the Tyrells either, since Â they had been there for a while and seem to have no plans on leaving. they are pretty much residents of KL now. And no one says it's a violation of Guest Right in universe because neither Tyrion or Sansa were guest. it's different than when it for sure was violated in the case of Crasters Keep and The Red Wedding, since they were only going to be there for a bit.
Â 
I do wonder why no one accuses Tyrion or Jaime of guest right violation when Bran gets pushed out the window and later almost killed by an assassin.

4222	WinterKing	2014-04-13	Share!
4223	Mr Smith	2014-04-14	I watched it with a couple of friends, who both reckon the Tyrell's killed Joffery. So I started screwing with them, and now I've got one of them convinced it was SansaÂ  
Â 
In other news, my uncle wonders whether Jaime and Cersei's incest is going to become public knowledge now, and will prevent Tommen from being crowned.
Â 
No one seemed particularly upset about Joffery's death.
4224	The Kinkslayer	2014-04-14	Dwarf-Stannis used his broomstick red woman to birth another shadow baby and kill Joff
4225	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-04-14	I watched it with my hubby and he was saying "Yes! Yes! Finally!" when Joffrey died. He loved it. He was guessing pretty much everybody at the wedding as being the culprit, including Cersei and Brienne which obviously cracked me up. Â He is onto Dontos and finally after naming everyone he eventually got to Olenna or the Old Lady as he calls her. I have told him nothing.
Â 
He didn't have many other comments about the rest of it - doesn't like The Witch (Melisandre) and thinks Stannis' wife is awful. He said that if he was Theon he'd just provoke Ramsey into killing him.
4226	ShaggyCat	2014-04-14	I am so glad this has finally happened. I made a comment in the title of a photo on instagram of where I was up to ASoS once that alluded to the Purple Wedding and had a bunch of friends on facebook do that "WAAWAA SPOILERS ZOMG!!!" rant.Â 
Â 
Like, seriously. The book has been out for how many fucking years? Get a grip. The only people I have less sympathy for whinging about book spoilers are people complaining about the end of the Hobbit being "spoiled". It's only one of the highest selling books of all time people... suck it up!
4227	dbunting	2014-04-14	I have only spoken to one "unsullied" so far and he half expected him to die at the wedding, just wished he died more violently. Same as the rest of us. He did say he thinks it was the Tyrells. Only other odd thing is he asked if Brienne is going to start going after the Lannisters.
4228	Obebb	2014-04-14	About three quarters through the wedding when Joffrey started being really horrible my friend was like "Will he die soon? Please let him die soon." I could only respond "I don't knowÂ   "
Â 
When Joffrey first starting coughing my friend was laughing so hard because she thought he was choking on his pie "Oh my god, really? He's gonna die like that?" But then she slowly started to realize that is was obviously more than choking "Poison?". Now I think she thinks Petyr did it.

4229	GHOSTSTARK	2014-04-14	my sister kept saying throughout the whole episode how she couldnt take much more of Joffrey and kept asking when he'd die. my buddy told her book 8, and after the episode she was so happy haha
4230	GeorgeIAF	2014-04-14	Most think that another favourite character, Tyrion, will die.
4231	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-04-14	One person thinks it's Cersei that killed Joffrey. 1. Because he's out of control and 2. To get rid of Tyrion. Two birds with one stone. Not a bad theory.
4232	Lord Martin	2014-04-14	My wife went through just about all the options book readers have come up with, a real credit to the shows loyalty.
Â 
She noticed Sansa putting her hand in the cup, but didn't think it was her.
Â 
She suspected both Margery and the QoT but was also suspicious of the red viper.
Â 
Then she wanted to know if whoever did it, was Tywin in on it b/c he was losing control of Joffrey.... Â I just smiled and told her, we'll learn soon enough.
4233	Gendrys Forge	2014-04-14	My buddy figures one of the fighting dwarfs poisoned joffery and framed tyrion because they were jealous of how good he has it.
He also thinks that dany is at kings landing, about to launchÂ an attack.
Stannis will burn shireen.
The red viper is only "pretending" to be gay to get in closer to the royal family...somehow..
Â 
To be fair though he's not that much of anÂ idiot, just one of these assholes who HAS to be texting all the time, its hard to know whats happening when you look at your phone and reply "lol" every 2 minutes.Â  God I hate texting, its so fucking rude.
4234	The Red Haired Viper	2014-04-14	My Unsullied girlfriend loved the episode, but immediately predicted the QoT poisoned Joffrey.

4237	The Drunkard	2014-04-14	The weirdest (most creative?) guess I've heard is that Oberyn and the Tyrells were in on it. Not a bad guess, I think. The show hasn't established any Martell-Tyrell hatred, the Tyrells have reason to supplant the Lannisters and Oberyn quite obviously wants revenge against them.
Â 
I'm looking forward to where they take this theory when Oberyn and Mace end up on the jury.
4238	Black_Robin	2014-04-14	My friend didn't do the predictions, but I did get this series of messages:

I just watched it
I nearly jumped for joy when it happened
although I am scared for Tyrion
and I don't want to say "well they can't kill tyrion" because well really
it's GoT
Mind blowwwwn
and it's only the 2nd episode of the season!
Â 
^
Am I evil for enjoying how tortured she is?

4239	Harry Lime	2014-04-14	I did a little Whodunnit survey, and the most likely suspects to my unsullied group are "The Jester," Oberyn, or Margery, but they did comment on how literally anyone in attendance would have wanted Joffrey dead.
Â 
I'm surprised how few of them suspect Olenna. I guess her "You fools! Help your king!" was pretty convincing.
4240	Jerol	2014-04-14	My wife had to watch the rerun an hour later just to savor Joffrey's demsie. Note, she did not do that for the previous wedding.Â
4241	ohpooratlas	2014-04-14	My boyfriend is unsullied and never comments during the episodes. But as Joffrey was humiliating Tyrion I could tell he was getting irritated and he finally turned to me and asked "Please tell me that when he finally dies, it's really painful?" He's very anti-book spoilers so I was completely caught off guard and was like "Um, durp ... cough ... um ... Yes? Maybe?" 
Â 
And five minutes later he dies!
Â 
Predictably, he was like "Not a violent enough death."
Â 
He's made no comment about who actually did the deed. From what I've been able to gauge from other unsullied reactions, very few people suspect Lady Olenna. So that should be a fantastic surprise to everyone.
Â 
I also like how unsullied viewers are like "Well this sets up the rest of the season as a whodunit?" But if the show follows the books, Littlefinger should reveal the plot to Sansa in the next episode or two. So of course the whodunit is a red herring. It doesn't matter who did it. It matters that Tyrion was fingered for it and now everyone will be on the edge of their seats wondering if one of their favorites will die.
4242	Cersei the Great	2014-04-14	My Unsullied husband is convinced that Oberyn was responsible. Â
4243	Natalie Underfoot	2014-04-14	I've heard the Tyrell's and specifically the QoT but my husband also suggested Tywin "allowing" it as he views him as relatively competent and ruthless. Â 
Â 
At this point the Dontos/Sansa dynamic is considered completely separate which I'm okay with as I loved the realization in the book about how deep the plot went.
Â 
As far as Stannis, I asked my husband if he felt Stannis was a fanatic and he said he absolutely gets the impression that Stannis is doing what he needs to do to win and thought that when Stannis called his brother-in-law an "infidel" he was saying it out of disgust and he fixated more on the fact that he disobeyed an order from Stannis and so that's why he okayed the burning.

4244	Sarah Lannister	2014-04-14	I read the books, but I admit, I'm curious to what's going to happen to Locke.Â  Will he actually make it to the wall, or will he run into the Thenns.Â  I'dÂ loved to see Locke and his search party making camp for the night, and haveÂ Shaggydog/wolfpack attack them...or maybe even the Umbers w/Rickon.
4245	Mark Antony	2014-04-14	My brother thought it was Oberyn
4246	protar	2014-04-14	My mum thinks that it's either Olenna, or Dontos and she's leaning towards Olenna I think. She definitely doesn't think it was Margaery because she thinks that Marg would wait until consummating the marriage so her position would be secure.
4247	Bluecore	2014-04-14	My brother said Cersei (first time I heard her named) or Oberyn.Â
4248	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-04-14	So initially one of my friends suspected Sansa, but then after rewatching the scene he suspects Margaery. He actually is reading the books, but has only just finished ACOK. Funny thing is I'm not even sure whether he is right or wrong. It's still widely disputed about who physically poisoned him. Regardless he didn't seem to suspect Olenna and it seems no unsullied have any suspicions about Littlefinger being in on it. It should play out vey nicely.Â
4249	The Dublin Warrior	2014-04-14	My dad thought it was Oberyn, I remained quiet he forced me to tell him who I thought it was. I told him to guess he still didn't say the Tyrells until I suggested it.
4250	Dildo_Baggins	2014-04-14	Non readers are unsullied?


lol yeah...could someone explain why though?
4251	lyanna_maria	2014-04-14	My Unsullied flatmate doesn't even wanna say who she thinks poisoned him because she's afraid I'll make a face and then she'll know if she's right or not haha (which is a pretty valid fear) 
By I was very surprised about her reaction... She hates Joffrey as much as anyone, but was pretty horrified of his death and is a bit scared that there's a general explosion of joy over someone's death haha I had to go over every awful thing Joffrey has done. 
She also keeps on feeling sorry for Tyrion: she thinks everyone treats him badly, from his own family to Oberyn Martell. In the Shae scene, she felt awfully bad for her, even though she normally doesn't like her, which I don't think it's good news, taking into account what's coming. She also pities Theon so, so, so much, and thinks Ramsay Snow and Selyse Florent are completely insane.
4252	Onna Lewyys	2014-04-14	^ She's good in my book.
4253	It's Not That Littlefinger	2014-04-14	i've heard a lot of people say sansa did it. apparently her picking up the cup was easily remembered.
4254	Milady May	2014-04-14	My friend immediately said Olenna (The Old Lady to her), but mostly because it's one of ther favourite characters. She's sure the poison was in the pie, though.
4255	Gneisenau	2014-04-14	Ser Dontos.
4256	Impish	2014-04-14	My friend has been saying "I can't WAIT until he dies... GRRR!" for years, I've been vaguely telling him he will be "satisfied" by what happens to Joffrey.
Â 
He was very pleased.
Â 
I asked him if he thought Tyrion did it (NOBODY I've asked today has thought it was Tyrion), he said "Nope. It was the fool", and he also thinks Oberyn is behind the whole thing.
4257	Lady Flandrensis	2014-04-14	The unsullied in my life are all over the place with whodunnit. A big email day.
Nobody thinks it was Tyrion.
Everyone thinks the QoT was in it.
The consensus is it was a conspiracy of many, including LF, Dontos (unwittingly), QoT, Margaery and maybe Tywin.
I've kept me trap shut. 
For peep who've never read anything, they're pretty sharp.
4258	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-14	Well. My mum picked up who did the poisoning immediately. She was spot-on too. She did need a slight nudge in where the poison came from but mum is a sharp cookie and really pays attention to shit. Her predictions are a little less on the mark but really, how is anyone gonna know whats coming unless they've read? Mum thinks Sansa might back Tyrion if he goes to trial. (oh mum...) She also thinks that Sansa is off to Highgarden. Majority of Unsullied think that Dontos is an agent of Olenna's. Not a bad lead actually.
Â 

Â 
Â 
Alright, so I think that Olenna and that knight are working together. Basically the necklace was the symbol for Olenna to poison Joffrey, and that is when he would take Sansa to escape. Since she wants Sansa to remain safe; the Tyrells and Starks have no bad blood
Â I think that Sansa may be going either to Pentos or Dorne, but I'm not sure
Â Since Margaery and Joffrey are married, she is the queen reagent
Â while I presume Tommen becomes the king
This is my friend's little theory. I did tell him that since Joff is toast, Marg is up for grabs again.Â 
So thats two non-readers who pin it on Olenna.Â
4259	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-14	My dad said it was Sansa.Â  
Â 
My mom thought it was Margaery (so close!)
Â 
So funny that not a single Unsullied I've seen has mentioned Littlefinger!
4260	Rapsie	2014-04-14	Finally watched the episode with my other half. His thoughts below:
Him: It's all going to shit when the blond chick arrives with the dragons. 
Me: Do you know the blond chick's name?
Him: Nope. 
(On seeing the wedding gift from Mace Tyrell.)
"Do they have charity shops in Westeros?"
"Is it Stavos and Davos?"
"I don't fancy charcoaled priest tonight." (Dinner scene at Dragon Stone when Stannis pushes his meat away)
"She's beautiful. I mean she's not ugly this other one, but she looks so plain compared to her."   (Referencing Mel and Selyse)
"She looks like she's from Star Trek. What the fuck is she wearing?" (Brienne's outfit)
On the Purple Wedding:
"Grandma did it"
4261	Lord Damian	2014-04-14	Nobody thinks Sansa did it but they remembered the necklace and Ser Dontos. Lady Oleana removing Sansa's braid from it and scenes of her with the chalice in the foreground, looking calm and concentrating.
4262	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-14	My dad said it was Sansa.Â  
Â 
My mom thought it was Margaery (so close!)
Â 
So funny that not a single Unsullied I've seen has mentioned Littlefinger!


I know! The LF reveal is gonna be gr9!Â
4263	Angmar	2014-04-14	It's my mother's first episode she's ever watched, and she's an Unsullied. And half the episode I was explaining to her about random info (who's this character, who are they related to, blah blah)
Â 
A funny thing she said during the episode:
Â 
"That boy king's a git"
Â 
"Yeah, you really wanna punch him no?"
Â 
"Yeah, but sadly he's the type of guy tv shows keep for all seasons".
Â 
Her face at the end of the episodeÂ  
Â 
She comments it was very well made and planned, due to so much focus on different characters at the wedding, with different interactions, and almost nobody seems to love "the boy king", it's hard to pinpoint exactly who did it.
Â 
Also, she's noticed about the poisoning, wondering if either the wine or the pie was poisoned (she goes more towards the wine). She wonders about the "cup exchange"...And she believes Sansa was the one who did it, or at least she's mildly involved along with the jester, because it's such a "coincidence" that at the moment Joffrey dies, Dontos comes over and takes her away...
Â 
Not bad for your first screening.Â
4264	Madfunkymonkey	2014-04-14	An old Army buddy of mine thinks that the "fool" poisoned Joffery.
4265	Obebb	2014-04-14	My sister thought Joffrey choked on the pie; the doings of an evil cook. Even after all that bleedingÂ
4266	eyeheartsansa	2014-04-15	My wife's first words as the credits were rolling:
Â 
It was the grandmother, wasn't it?
Â 
She is pretty good at guessing things on TV, so I wasn't really surprised. Â I let her know that this is known as the Purple Wedding and asked if she noticed anything purple displayed prominently on screen, and if gramma was involved was it originally her idea or someone else's?
Â 
I am looking forward to theÂ bomb being dropped at some point when we are shown just how many things Littlefinger is behind. Â That's something my wife wouldn't be able to guess because she doesn't spend much time thinking about it.

4267	shiola	2014-04-15	My coworker came up to me and said, "So.. Â Joffrey's dead, right?"
4268	ovis alba	2014-04-15	"My Unsullied" sort of all agree that it was the Tyrells but none of them really figured out how it was done.
4269	Beatrijs	2014-04-15	My unsullied coworker thought the Tyrel's did it to get power. But when I told him Tommen would be king after Joff he thought Cersei did it to get rid of Marg and the rest of the Tyrels...

					
					
							Edited by Beatrijs, 15 April 2014 - 04:59 AM.
4270	Angmar	2014-04-15	She has no hope of Tyrion living though. She fully expects him to go to the chopping block next episode, lol
4271	angjen0816	2014-04-15	I have read a lot of people thinking it was Cercei, which would be quite poetic. Another trend is people, quite a lot in fact, seem to think it was the pie that did him in rather than the wine.
4272	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-04-15	Re-watched it with the hubby and he figured out w/o my help that it was Olenna. Â I then showed him the necklace scene. Â My dad told my mom it was Olenna, but she still thinks Cersei is in on it. Â My mom just really hates Cersei. Â No one has an inkling of a clue about LF so that'll be a nice reveal.
4273	Iron Victory's Captain	2014-04-15	I watch the show with 3-4 friends who havn't read the books. They are very interested and pay attention really well (remeber all the names etc) but I'd still label them as casual fans.
After Jeoffreys choking scene, they all high-fived each other and watched the scene a couple times over. Afterwards they were asking who did it and were discussing all possibilities:
- Tywin: because he things Jeoffrey is a lose canon
- "Old woman" (Queen of Thorns): because she know Jeoffrey is a prick. However they couldn't understand why they'd do it because it gives their family less power.
- The fool (Dontos): Because payback.
- Prince Oberyn/ Elaria Sand: because he's a bad-ass and hates Lannisters. "Didn't he come to kingslanding to do something like this?"
- Varys: because the is creepy and might "serve the realm" by killing Jeoffrey
- Tyrion: payback, although they let go of this idea I think.
- Sansa: Because she handed the cup to Tyrion, and has a good reason to kill him.
- Margaery: Because she knows Jeoffreys a monster and she might have ordered the cake (and fed him herself).
- Melisandre/Stannis: because she asked the lord of light.
Â 
They still havn't figured it out but they think Dontos, Tyrells or Oberyn is most likely.
4274	ovis alba	2014-04-15	Well the last one is not too wrong also.
I noticed that basically all of my Unsullied friends completly forgot about the leeches actually.
4275	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-04-15	My coworker came up to me and said, "So.. Â Joffrey's dead, right?"


Â 
No just a little setback, just needs some rest and chicken soup and that internal bleeding will subside.Â
4276	Luthien125	2014-04-15	I watched it with my mom and while chatting with my best friend. They both had very different reactionsâ<U+0080>¦
Â 
Mom: was shocked with Joffrey's death, but what she was more concerned about was Ramsay and his opening scene. She said she hates the character, that the Red Wedding was horrible but that the Ramsay scenes don't seem to have a purpose. She hated it and said she doesn't know if she will be watching again, especially because if Joffrey dies all the "bully" scenes will now focus with Ramsay and she just can't take it.
Â 
Best friend: had no comments about the first part of the episode, but during the wedding she kept saying everything was too quiet and something bad was going to happen, when Joffrey finally died she was really, really happy, and she couldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t believe itâ<U+0080>¦ later she got obsessed with who did it, she even asked me to tell her.. Â She thought the "jester" and the "grandma" had something to do with it, and I told her she was on the right track but, that there was someone else that had come up with the master planâ<U+0080>¦ So she is really looking forward to the next episode.Â
4277	lyanna_maria	2014-04-15	I've spoken with my best friend and his first thought was Cersei, but he immediately jumped to the Queen of Thorns. With some clues and a bit of guidance by me, he was able to guess the necklace thing: but he didn't mention Littlefinger. He's wondering if Margaery was involved or not.Â 
Â 
By the way, he asked me who's gonna be in the throne now, because he/she would have benefited from the death of the king. I had to remind him of the existence of Tommen. Once he knew he was gonna be the new king, he predicted that now Margaery is gonna marry him (I didn't give him any clues there, I promise!) ^^
Â 
He loves Tyrion and fears for him, and he also keeps emphasizing how much he pities Theon.Â 
Â 
PS: I didn't even think about the leeches... I'm assuming none of my Unsullied remember them. I might mention it to my best friend and see what he thinks, or maybe it's better if I wait until Balon Greyjoy's death.
4278	Ice_and_Fire	2014-04-15	My brother thinks that LF was ultimately behind Joffrey's death but is torn over who physically poisoned him, he thinks Sansa or Cersei.Â 
The only family he doesn't think did it are the Tyrells! Haha he can't see how they would have anything to gain from it.Â
4279	Fool of a Book	2014-04-15	Just talked to my brother, he said he expected Joffrey to die but not so soon in the story...and he thinks "the fool dude" (Dontos) had something to do with it... he caught the necklace significance. Â He also thinks "the Inigo Montoya dude" (Oberyn) was involved.
Â 
(I told him he was partially right, but not about which part).
Â 
Also, he said that he missed "the dragon chick" in this week's episode. Â Having a relative love this series but reducing everyone to chicks and dudes is eye-opening to say the least.
Â 
Â
4280	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-15	My sister thought Joffrey choked on the pie; the doings of an evil cook. Even after all that bleedingÂ  


Â 
Awwwwww, I almost feel bad for laughing.Â
4281	ohpooratlas	2014-04-15	Finally was able to speak to two of my unsullied coworkers today.
Â 
One of them immediately fingered the QoT, but he was not entirely sure of himself and I steered him away for the time being. He then went on to list just about every possible suspect.
Â 
Another coworker thinks it's Sansa because she picked up the goblet from the floor and handed it to Tyrion (the other mentioned this as well). My response is always "You really think Sansa is cunning enough/her honorable Stark background would let her do that?" and they both were like "YES. ABSOLUTELY." Lolz.
Â 
Neither of them have an inkling of a clue that Littlefinger is involved. One asked me if we'd find out who did it sooner rather than later, and I said more than likely if they follow the books.
4282	zombree	2014-04-15	My non bookreader friends are not very fun when i ask them what they think is happening. One of the guys i pestered about it thinks Tywin is going to be king, because he is completely unaware Joffrey had a younger brother the other one says he has no idea but doesn't like that Tyrion got framed for itÂ
4283	Impish	2014-04-15	Another friend:
Â 
"Many plausible options. The silly fool who ushers stark away is too obvious (I think he will be a patsy). And Tyrion would kill his father or sister first"
4284	VeturKemur	2014-04-15	My sister's boyfriend thinks Tywin is going to be in it until the end because "he's too conniving to be killed". Ha, surprise ahead for him.
4285	starkfever	2014-04-16	i was surprised when i asked one of my coworkers who he thought poisoned joff, and right away he said littlefinger though through someone else. Â He doesnt know who he thinks actually poisoned him but hes dead set on that littlefinger is the one behind it all just because that is something he would do, just like betraying ned. Â im actually surprised he didnt figure out that he was right based on my reaction, i was stunned that he or any of the other non bookreaders i know actually guessed that.
4286	Ice_and_Fire	2014-04-16	I asked my brother if he knows who will be next on the throne and he didn't. The show hasn't really highlighted Tommen very well :-/
4287	Fylimar	2014-04-16	The non-readers in my group of friends suspect the Tyrells and/or Sansa. But they lean more toward Margaery. Some think, it could have been Cersei or Ser Dontos. One even did suspect Sigur RA3sÂ   ('that band playing at the wedding, because Joffrey didn't let them finish') - that one made me scream in laughter (but seriously, Joffrey deserved to die for interrupting Sigur RA3sÂ   ). But most think, that it was the Tyrells - so right direction.
Most are convinced, that Tyrion will die now and are already sad for him.Â
4288	Xcorpyo001	2014-04-16	I'm Â the only one of my friends that read the books, so I'm sort of banned from these after-show talks, and I can only use show stuff, even from the past when I'm in one of these reviews.
Â 
Tried to convince my friends that it was actually the butcher that did him in as revenge for Mycah when they got too close for comfort. Â  Â Â 
Told them about the 'foreshadowing' in episode 1 when we are reminded about him(the scene with the Hound talking about the 'code'), pointing out that he had access to the food and drinks, nobody pays attention to the servants and someone could use him as their pawn because they know about his thirst for revenge against Jeoff.
Almost had them, but I couldn't help myself and burst out laughing while watching the look on their faces...
Â 
My failed attempt tricked them into increasing the suspects pool, and after thinking about all the times Tyrion pissed off Jeoff and vice-versa, they believe that only Dani coming with her dragons to conquer KL can save Tyrion from a certain slow and painful death at the hands of his sister.
4289	Belisarius09	2014-04-16	My friends totally fell for the Oberyn Martell diversion, and thought it was him. Â I finally caved in and gave them a hint after they threatened to look up the answer if I didn't tell them, so I showed them a photo of Sansa's necklace, and from there they were able to piece it together, sorta...
Â 
My mother is convinced Tywin did it due to his conflicts with Joffrey in the past season. Â She sees him as being ruthless enough to do it. Â Not a bad guess, there are even popular theories out there amongst book readers that Tywin may have had a hand, contributing to the Tyrell plot. Â 
Â 
Sadly none of my friends bought my Arya "theory", that Arya killed Joffrey with her new assassin powers by recruiting her friend Hotpie, who baked and poisoned the pie. Â xD

4290	aameen	2014-04-16	i was encouraging my family to think like detectives. telling them to analyse all the suspects.
my brother mentioned, "the sneaky dude with the mustache, why wasn't he at the wedding?".
i told him "he went to marry Lysa, the breastfeeding lady, remember?"
then he said, "so we definitely know he's not sniping from a tower? cool."
---i feel like an idiot.
4291	Mel_Rose	2014-04-16	My sister said that she has no idea who is behind it, "maybe Sansa". She thinks that it was in the wine and that Tyrion won't die but "he'll be in prison for a while". She also thinks Margaery is the Queen now and she made an interesting observation, that Cersei is slowly going crazy.
Â 
I read the comments on a couple of reviews and many of the Unsullied think Margaery is the new Queen. Some think it was in the pie not the wine. Oberyn is a huge fan-favorite and also a suspect; QoT and Tywin and the fool and even Cersei have been named, but NEVER Littlefinger. It'll be awesome when they see him next episode waiting for Sansa on the boat 
Â 
Â 
Edit: I asked her if she thinks there'll be any other big name deaths this season and she thinks no, this is it. Next season someone important will die.
Â 
Â 


The non-readers in my group of friends suspect the Tyrells and/or Sansa. But they lean more toward Margaery. Some think, it could have been Cersei or Ser Dontos.

4292	gotgrrrl	2014-04-16	Husband originally thought it was Sansa who poisoned Joff because she had the opportunity when picking up the cup under the table but then I pointed out how suspicious the QoT was acting with the necklace and all.Â  He also thought the pie might have been poisoned because the camera does linger a minute on the dead birds in the pie.Â 
Â 
Also, he claims he has never seen Selyse before although he's watched every episode.Â  Somehow her existence just didn't stick with him.Â  He expressed confusion about why Stannis was "burning people" and seemed to think the Red Woman had "made up" her religion.Â  I had to remind him about Beric Dondarrion coming back to life by Thoros and explain that it was part of the same religion that originated in Essos (which I then had to show him on a map).Â 

	Â
4293	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-04-16	I asked my brother if he knows who will be next on the throne and he didn't. The show hasn't really highlighted Tommen very well :-/


Â 
Why is not on the viewer to pay enough attention to know who the characters are? It's not a simple story, and like anything if you casually watch it paying half attention you're not going to know all the details and often be confused.Â 
Â 
There are threads here with people learning things from the books that they didn't realize until someone told them. Hell, I've read each book at least 4 times and every now and then I learn something new. I don't really fault GRRM for not beating me over the head with the information.
4294	KeeperOfOaths	2014-04-16	I don't remember who my colleagues from work thought it was. I have to ask them again tomorrow.
Â 
But a friend of mine texted me just after the end of the episode and asked me: " it was Dontos, right?"
Â 
She wanted me to tell her who it was, so I told her that we don't know for sure (honestly, I didn't remember in that moment if we knew for a fact or not who did it) but in principle it was Olenna with Littlefinger.
Â 
To which she told me: "I don't think that Littlefinger knew about it."

Â 
Wait till Episode 10 and her mind will be blown!
4296	Mia B.	2014-04-16	Most think it was Olenna... I think the show kind of made it obvious. Also several think it was Cersei?
4297	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-04-16	I think it's interesting how many people think it's Cersei. It goes to show that as much as people on here argue that the show has softened that character, clearly not as much as people on here like to think.
4298	lyanna_maria	2014-04-17	While talking to Unsullied about the whodunnit issue I've been surprised to hear how they moral,y consider certain characters. I met an Unsullied yesterday and he guessed it was Olenna (only after I told him the poisoner was at the wedding, because he thought there might be some wider plot...)
But I don't think he would consider Tywin able to do it because he told me "I've heard that he is VERY bad in the books, but in the show they've made him kind of likeable, right?". I also told him that a lot of readers think that Cersei's character is a bit whitewashed in the show, and he was surprised because he considers Cersei bad and he hates her. He also used to think Jaime was a "really, really bad guy" and is amazed at the change he is showing.
I was more upset to find out that he has no clue about anything related to Robert's Rebellion: I asked if he understood why Obern hated the Lannisters and he had no idea.
Another of my friends has read only halfway into ASoS and she guessed it was "the Tyrells".

4299	KeeperOfOaths	2014-04-17	ok, I have asked my colleagues.
Â 
One thinks it was Margaery. She is not sure and she doesn't have other real suspects. She thinks Donos was weird, but she doesn't think he did it.
Â 
The other one thinks it may have been 1. Tyrion; 2. Oberyn; 3. Sansa. Although he thinks Sansa is too soft; she wouldn't be capable of such a thing. I asked him how could Oberyn have done it. He was nowhere near the table. He said that Oberyn might have done it with help from third parties; servants or such!! Cllueless, I love it!!
4300	Rohanne4	2014-04-17	My brother was unfortunately spoiled that Joffrey would die, but he didn't know when. It actually caught him off guard that it happened this early. He thinks Cersei did it. Oberyn is too obvious, Tyrion is clearly innocent, and Sansa would never do that sort of thing (although he did think it odd that someone was there to take her away right when it happened, and he thinks she will go to her aunt's). It was mentioned several times about Cersei not being queen, and she obviously loves power, so by killing Joffrey, he thinks she will remain in power longer since Tommen is still young. Plus, she hates Tyrion, so it was the perfect way to remain in power and get rid of Tyrion in the process.Â 
Â 
Â
4301	Baltan	2014-04-17	In the scene where Bran interacts with Bloodraven, and he says "I know where we have to go" my brother said very convinced "Oh... King's Landing is where they are heading now!".
Â 
I couldn't correct him, explaining that the conversation ended with a clear "find me under a tree, NORTH" because HBO and Martin are such cunning creatures that all those king's landing images might be foreshadowing something. And I will die before being proved wrong by my brother in a matter where I'm supposed to know better.
4302	Le Cygne	2014-04-17	Yeah, I was just told it was Sansa because she picked up the cup and was glaring at Joffrey.
4303	Onna Lewyys	2014-04-17	I asked her if she thinks there'll be any other big name deaths this season and she thinks no, this is it. Next season someone important will die.

Aww, sweet summer child.
I'm honestly shocked that there are actually unsullied who figured out that Littlefinger is involved. He's been gone for six episodes! I'd figured they'd all forgotten about him.
4304	Three sisters	2014-04-18	The unsullied I watched the episode with, figured it out right away it was QoT (with or without help from Marg) who poisoned Joffrey. Clearly, that must have been obvious in some way. However, they didn't know how.Â At that point they pressured me to reveal the purpose of the necklace. So on request I spoilered them. They don't know who's gonna to be the next king. Or how important the Tyrion trial is going to be. They also think that Shae is out of the picture for good (which was accompanied by a cheer because none of them like the actrice and/or the character Shae much). They've been wondering where LF is. And they expect him to show up in the E3.Â
4305	Beric175	2014-04-18	My brother laughed a little at the sight of Joffrey's purple face. He overall, does not do predictions, as he is not into ASOIAF/GOT but he occasionally watches the episodes of the show with me.
4306	TheBadboy	2014-04-14	Only for book readers..
Â 
It was very clear that olenna wasresponsible for poisoning Joffrey, right from her sneaky conversation with Sansa where she chipped the poison amethyst to her facial expressions , it was her show.Â 
But my question is how big a part did Margaery play in the actual poisoning.Â 
She looked distressed due to all of Joffrey's actions during the wedding , She even tried to stop him when he was being atrocious.Â 
And if you observe carefully she was the one that Joffrey handed his cup to when he got the pie and she placed it within Olenna's reach .Â 
So is it safe to assume that Marg was completely aware of all the plotting , because in the books she may not have been.Â 
Â 
And is the show already setting up the Marg- Cersei cat fight with Cersei clearly opposing the new queens order?
Â 
Â 
Will Loras have a fling with Oberyn ( there is no such indication in the books)
Â 
And I loved the Tyrells in this episode.
From Jaime-Loras to Tywin -Olenna and the short lived romance of king and queen. They were awesome!!!
4307	Dragon's Bane	2014-04-14	Mace has fallen a bit flat, he seemed far more pompous in the books, altough Olenna's "Not now, Mace." was really well done.
Â 
I hate how Loras seems to be a real slut in the show. I was under the impression that he really, really loved Renly and that he joined the Kingsguard because his one true love died. In the show, he is portrayed like a gay stereotype which has a feel of bigotry on it.
Â 
Margaery always felt like Olenna's granddaughter to me, very cunning about her business. They played a nice farce which is only possible if everyone involved knows their part. Especially if you consider that the poison had to be close to Margaery and Olenna would never endanger her granddaughter by not telling her of the plot - at least that was the impression I got from the books.
4308	WiDMNDBAMMD	2014-04-14	Only for book readers..
Â 
It was very clear that olenna wasresponsible for poisoning Joffrey, right from her sneaky conversation with Sansa where she chipped the poison amethyst to her facial expressions , it was her show.Â 
But my question is how big a part did Margaery play in the actual poisoning.Â 
She looked distressed due to all of Joffrey's actions during the wedding , She even tried to stop him when he was being atrocious.Â 
And if you observe carefully she was the one that Joffrey handed his cup to when he got the pie and she placed it within Olenna's reach .Â 
So is it safe to assume that Marg was completely aware of all the plotting , because in the books she may not have been.Â 
Â 
And is the show already setting up the Marg- Cersei cat fight with Cersei clearly opposing the new queens order?
Â 
Â 
Will Loras have a fling with Oberyn ( there is no such indication in the books)

Â 
I have to be honest, it wasn't easy for me to "see" and I watched on a 60 inch HD TV. Without knowing what to look for it's impossible to know who did it without carfully rewatching. I mean unsullied didn't even know he was going to die right?
Â 
and I'll go to my grave believing that Margaery had to know what was going to happen in the books. Her and Jofrey were drinking out of the same cup. Her grandmother isn't going to risk killing her little Margaery.
Â 
The Tyrells and Martells aren't really good "friends". Dorne and the Reach were at constant border wars with eachother before Aegon's conquest.
Â 
and in the books don't forget that Oberyn crippled Willas the "heir" to Highgarden. While in the show he doesn't appear to exist at all and the hostility is toned down to put more on the focus of Lannister vs. Martell.
Â 
so Oberyn likes pretty boys right? Big change of circumstance but whatever....

To be fair, Oberyn was the one giving him the eyes. Loras sort of just acknowledged it with a smile before turning around.

In the book, Jaime is telling someone (can't remember who) about Oberyn and says he's got more bastards than Robert had and likes boys too.

His bi-sexuality was there in the books, most have probably forgotten.

Actually, it's not. Loras's relationship with Renly is quite known by others, they don't say "it's said Loras sleep with men": they mention their relationship a few times. In Oberyn's case, it looks like it's said to speak ill about him.

Â 
Well then they are playing up the rumors a lot more, just like they played up Loras and Renley too. Many of the scenes between them weren't in the book and were added for effect. I think the same is being done with Oberyn. It's implied he's bisexual and so they have to play it up with some over the top flirting with Loras. I guess it's ok, I didn't feel like it was too out of place considering they already added the whorehouse scene previously.
4314	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-14	I was just happy to see Loras get a bit of strength of character about him again. It went missing after Joffrey set Sansa aside.

Â 
From the preview (she seems upset about Joff's croaking vs. Olenna being pleased) I at least took a away the opposite i.e. she had no idea, Olenna did it all on her own.
Â

Nope. Finn said no sex(y) scenes for him this season (except for some flirting). He even was pouting about it a little.

Oh, please not this shit again. Tyrion thinks about it as a "rumor", Jaime says "... and beds with boys as well" to Tywin pretty matter of factly (ASOS chapter 62, p.855), and Arianne later thinks he stole her first boyfriend from her, which pisses her doubly off, because she had the hots for uncle Oberyn too (hey, it's GRRM).

Â 
However something seems off about poising the wine. As it is quiet likely to risk Margery (unless off course she is taken in confidence).
Â 
Any idea who made the Pie in the books. During the Pie cutting anyone also notice a dead Dove presumably from Jeofferys blade, What if that was the poison was in the Pie, again a big risk to all others in this case. Â
4318	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-14	For all that talk about Loras "not caring" about Renly's death, he sure as shit didn't take kindly to him being mocked during the entertainment. Thought that was a nice touch. Loras has been pretty hot and cold in the show, but I loved his scenes this episode.

This. I've always worked on the assumption that Marg was in on the Queen of Thorns plot to kill Joff.Â
4322	The Lady Leela	2014-04-14	I think the guy who plays Loras is really underrated on here. He portrays him brilliantly in my opinion.


Â 
I agree, and he cares a great deal about the source material and book Loras. I think I recently read an interview with him where he was kinda disappointed that the show has kinda downplayed Loras's storyline.

..


Â 
Agreed. As for the show (separate cups, which is weird because why bother showing Mace giving the big chalice as a gift then?), after Olenna palms the jewel from Sansa, you here an audible "plink" as she walks by Marg. She either dropped it in the cup or gave it to Margery directly, but there's no way Margery didn't know.
Â 
In the previews Marg may be expressing frustration that she's not a "true queen" and that maybe she didn't like the timing of it, but I don't think that's evidence that she had no idea what was going to happen. She may have not liked the timeline, or perhaps she did the poisoning after Joffrey was being awful to Tyrion (if you watch her face, Margery is very not happy). It's following those events that Marg directly takes Joff's cup, in fact.
Â 
Also notice it's the Tyrells that are all the first to react to the poisoning (as it was in the books, too). Highly suspicious. Show!Margery is incredibly cunning and astute. I'll bet 100 dragons that she knew.
4324	Er Rn	2014-04-14	Re: the look between Oberyn and Loras, I thought maybe it was to imply that he and the Tyrells were working together to poison Joff. I'm sure Oberyn will be suspected by unsullied viewers if the show mentions his notorious (rumored?) use of poisons against his enemies.

I always thought that Cersei would have Loras named to the kingsguard to get out of her marriage in the process pissing off the Tyrells and furthering the tension between the two sides. Although, now after watching the premiere I tend to lean on the side of Cersei pretending to be menopausal to remove herself from marriage.Â

Finn Jones does the best with what he is given. He's read all the books and really loves book Loras and the book Tyrells. I know he's become exceedingly frustrated with the portrayal of them on the show, but I think he's also just started to realize it is what it is, and go with it. I enjoyed the scene with Jamie and Loras to be sure, but considering the book!history with the Tyrells/Martells the flirting seemed ridiculous. But the book =/= the show, and with no Willas, I guess they are just going to take out all the antagonizing past between the houses.
Â 
Though I do wish the show would realize that just because there are two characters who aren't straight, doesn't mean they need to hook up with each other. Loras in the book is insanely devoted to Renly, even after death, and watching him flirt with every boy that bats an eye his way is cringe worthy.

Â 


Â Â  I don't think I call that a gay stereotype, as many of the characters on the show are promiscuous. Its just a GoT stereotype. . But Loras still give indications that he loved Renly in this episode. When the dwarfs came out and one of them was dressed as Renly, Loras got up and left.
Â Â  As for Mace, I agree. I hope his character gets more flavor as time goes on.
4333	Dragon of Valyria	2014-04-14	Honestly that's kind of absurd even for the Lannisters. Cersei would he amused because he's petty, but how would Tywin see that as a good idea in an honor-obsessed culture like Westeros? He should be annoyed that Joffrey is provoking such a powerful ally. That kind of insult is enough to cause a war. Especially as Loras is the heir in this version. 
The Tyrells kept calm -- barely -- because they knew the score, but Tywin doesn't know that.

You're right! Not sure how I missed that. Joffrey knows how to treat his in-laws
4335	Ser Areo Mace	2014-04-14	If you watch the scene again, when Joffrey hands his cup to Marg, she grabs it with one hand then passes the other hand up by the top, that could have been when she dropped it in.

Â 
Her hands are empty though (she's clapping right beforehand and then we see her gesture to Joff). But they do make a point of showing her with it. My guess is it happens off-screen.
Â 
I love that we're here over-analyzing the movement of every single Tyrell and the Unsullied are probably like "it was TOTALLY Oberyn." I have a feeling they're going to make it apparent next episode.

There is nothing in the books about this but my guess is yes, if Littlefinger tells the truth about their murder conspirancy. She would have to be a total idiot not knowing who stole Sansa away from KL (and her). I would even go so far as to say Varys knows too.

4341	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-04-14	I agree with those who say that the Episode 3 promo seems to indicate Margaery wasn't aware of the plot, but perhaps this reads differently when seen in context. I'm very interested to see how the show reveals the clues. Will it be noted in the next episode that Sansa has a gem missing from the necklace for instance?Â
4342	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-14	For what is worth, I think (hope?) Garlan was the one who did it in the books, after Olenna gave him the bead. I think Marg was aware to not drink from his cup
Â 
In the show, I think it was Lady O. There's a rather clear shot of her eyeing the goblet at one point. I'm actually very curious of how the Unsullied are going to react to her killing the absolute most despised character but framing the audience's fave at the same time.
Â 
As to Loras, glad he told Jaime to eat shit. That's the hot-headed smug bastard from the books that we all know!
Â 
But I'm less than thrilled with him and Oberyn flirting. They're supposed to hate each other, damn it. Loras ain't Willas

Â 
I think its more that she is mad she isnt Queen, after all her ambition is life is to be THE queen, rather than shock. The Tommen-Marg relationship hasn't been put forward yet and that goes along way to calm her down.
Â 
I think that Margery had to be in on it. Olenna wouldn't have poisoned Joffery to only risk her as well. She would have only done it if she could guarantee her safety (otherwise whats the point in killing her monster of a husband?) and the only way to do that when they are sharing a chalice is to make sure she doesn't drink from it. Having them both share the chalice also helps give the Tyrells an out, leaving Tyrion pretty much the only suspect with the means and motive.
Â 
Also, risking Margerys life means they essentially have no power. They need to wed into the Lannisters to secure a hold on the Throne. There is absolutely NO WAY, they would risk it. Margery is a huge deal to them.
Â 
We see Dontos and Sansa making for the cliffs in the preview, so i think its safe to say we will see the handover to Littlefinger. I think from there they will spell it out regarding the necklace/hairnet.

Word. But maybe she'll take on Willas' and Garlan's supposed big roles, and maybe we'll see the Ironborn attack on the Reach from her perspective
4348	Berry	2014-04-14	On my re-watch last night I noticed a loud 'clink' as the QOT walks away from Sansa and past Margery. Also, this happens right before the moment when Margery is looking at the singers and looking quite contemplative.
Â 
My unsullied friends noticed nothing even after the re-watch and thought the sound was background noise from the feast, but my book-reader friends are conviced this sets up Margery as the person who does the actual poisoning after the QOT retrieves the 'gem' from Sansa. Given Margery's reactions to Joffrey during the wedding and the fact that she handles his cup quite a bit leading up to the death scene, I have to say I'm quite convinced myself....thoughts?
4349	TheNorth's1stKnight	2014-04-14	in the books i'm pretty sure margaery was never involved and from the look of the promo for next episode she looks pissed that olenna had joffrey poisoned.

4351	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-15	I loved the Tyrell reactions to Renly/ LorasÂ being mocked. Margaery beingÂ clearly displeased, Olenna giving a stony faced 'shake of the head'Â and Loras storming away. I bet any doubts Olenna may have had (and Margaery if sheÂ  was in on it)Â vanished after seeingÂ JoffreyÂ ridicule one of their own in such a way....probably enjoyedÂ poisoning the little shit afterÂ that. Â 
Â 
I'm kind of hoping Margaery was in on it as I think it would add to her character (well her show one). She's pretty much Grandma's little girl and seems capable of such an act.
4352	BlueDragon	2014-04-16	Margery has to know; she probably even plunked the jewel in. Â The promo scene is just meant to reinforce that she wants to be Queen and regrets that she got so close only to wind up the almost queen, again. Â 
Â 
Margery can't be sure that the Tyrells will arrange a marriage to Tommen, but Margery will be more than satisfied with that when it happens. Â Cersei will be even more incessensed as Tommen is malleable to her and Margery will be in the way of that. Â This sets up the battle of the Queens quite nicely. Â Tommen is such a nice kid it is hard to contemplate the horrors awaiting him.Â 
Â 
I don't think the Tyrells could have known how out of control Joffrey would be in terms of Tyrion. Â The axe falling on him was probably quite accidentally a bonus for them.
Â 
Having Margery drinking from the same cup was their cover up, so she has to know when the poison is dropped into the cup. Â My bet from the screen version is that she, herself, dropped the jewel into the cup.
Â 
As far as Loras goes, he is humiliated and angry as he recognizes the skit as aimed at him too. Â It just proves how dangerous Joffrey will be to the Tyrells if he stays alive. Â I would guess, everyone except Mace, is thrilled the plot succeeded although I don't think Loras was in on it.
Â 
Oberyn flirting with Loras is just Oberyn being Oberyn and doesn't mean a thing about Lora's feelings or inclinations. Â The poster above who doesn't seem to have a clue about this being a bigotted stereotype is clueless.
Â 
P.S. I did NOT read Tywin's face as pleased at that skit. Â He would consider it unnecessary provocation of in laws and lots of others and beneath the dignity of his house. Â I watched his face closely on multiple replays. Â He is not happy about that skit in any way.
Â 
In fact, the only ones who are happy are Joffrey and Cersei, everyone else at the front tables is in various stages of shock and disgust.

4353	Chebyshov	2014-04-16	Margery has to know; she probably even plunked the jewel in. Â The promo scene is just meant to reinforce that she wants to be Queen and regrets that she got so close only to wind up the almost queen, again. Â 


Â 
I agreed with most of this, until I saw this (slight spoilers, potentially):Â https://www.youtube....h?v=phJb60y5wlE
Jump to 3:26 and listen to what Natalie Dormer says.
Â 
Obviously Show!Margery was never in danger from the cup, so she wouldn't have had to know. I hope I'm wrong or Natalie's interview was edited or something.
4354	Frumpus	2014-04-16	Only for book readers..
Â 
It was very clear that olenna wasresponsible for poisoning Joffrey, right from her sneaky conversation with Sansa where she chipped the poison amethyst to her facial expressions , it was her show.Â 
But my question is how big a part did Margaery play in the actual poisoning.Â 
She looked distressed due to all of Joffrey's actions during the wedding , She even tried to stop him when he was being atrocious.Â 
And if you observe carefully she was the one that Joffrey handed his cup to when he got the pie and she placed it within Olenna's reach .Â 
So is it safe to assume that Marg was completely aware of all the plotting , because in the books she may not have been.Â 
Â 
And is the show already setting up the Marg- Cersei cat fight with Cersei clearly opposing the new queens order?
Â 
Â 
Will Loras have a fling with Oberyn ( there is no such indication in the books)
Â 
And I loved the Tyrells in this episode.
From Jaime-Loras to Tywin -Olenna and the short lived romance of king and queen. They were awesome!!!


Â 
In the books, Margaery is still quite young and likely not a part of the plotting. On the tv show she is an adult in her late 20s, so its very likely that she was in on it as was the rest of the Tyrell family (maybe not Loras, he doesn't seem the type to be able to keep secrets).
Â 
And I also believe the Tyrells plotted to kill Joffrey knowing full well that Tommen would be next in line and it would be easy to hook Margaery up with him.

I guess it could be misdirection but certainly this makes it seem like she didn't have a part in it. I wouldn't be surprised if the show just has it be Olenna who dropped it in. It's not like us book readers can even agree on who dropped it in in the book (or if it even was in the wine), so D&D clearly just made their own interpretation of who it was. The funny thing is it really doesn't matter much. In the end it was the Tyrells' and Littlefinger's plan and Tyrion was blamed.Â

Â 
Yeah, I agree, and I assumed it was QoT until rewatching it, because it doesn't look like she gets the chance, whereas Marg does.
Â 
You're right that it's a small point though, and we may never get a full explanation, because you never know who's little birds are listening.
4357	The Singer	2014-04-17	It's a bit confusing whether Marg knew or not.
Â 
On one hand you have the scene where Marg and Olenna are choosing necklaces, now apparently for Sansa, not Marg.
Â 
Then in the preview for the next episode we have a clip of Marg saying "But I could of been Queen".
Â 
Then you would think that Olenna wouldn't put her own grand daughter in danger, whcih she would be if she didn't know about the poison plot.
Â 
Personally I think she must of known the whole thing but I guess we'll find out, the show is being a lot more revelaing than the book, I wonder if it will show who (if anyone) poisoned the person who dies on the toilet?
4358	joachim	2014-04-17	I always thought that Cersei would have Loras named to the kingsguard to get out of her marriage in the process pissing off the Tyrells and furthering the tension between the two sides. Although, now after watching the premiere I tend to lean on the side of Cersei pretending to be menopausal to remove herself from marriage.Â 


Ooh, savvy.
4359	Spotted Cat	2014-04-17	We see clearly Â Mace presenting the chalice to the happy couple. But they don't use the damn thing at all. in fact the cup is not even on the table in the feast.Â 
What we have to understand is that the cup is margery's main line of defence. She just have to say "hey i drank from the same cup" and just like that she is free of suspicion. why didn't they use it?Â 
1. Its actually margery who poisoned the "Brave little boy".
2. she is totally off the hook that she doesn't even need an alibi.
what do you think ?
Â
4360	zaphodbrx	2014-04-14	After watching the episode I thought a little about Show!Ramsey and want to speculate based on what they showed so far.
Â 
1. Ramsey and the hunt. This isn't something I would have picked to be the first scene of the episode but anyway. So, Ramsey, Theon and Miranda hunt a girl ( on foot, apparently ) with some dogs. Now I've paused the screen a couple of times here and while I don't think the actress is the same as not-Miranda from season 3, she looks a lot like her, and the dialogue pretty much establishes that she is the same one 'Your jealous and blah blah'.Â 
Â  Â This was suprising for me, I had no idea that those two would return, those were just naked women of the week. This is just so different from what is in the books. Apart from the fact that Ramsey doesn't have a psychotic girlfriend, the hunts are a lot more depraved and involved raping and flaying. I don't know where they are going with this 'Miranda' character, but I just hope she's not Fake!Arya.Â 
Â 
2. Locke. Another character not from the books. So he's going to hunt Rickon and Osha? Well I guess they're inventing a new storyline for Rickon and that doesn't bother me too much but still..
Â 
3. Theon. I get that they wanted to show how Theon is totally obedient to Ramsey now, but the shaving scene doesn't make any sense. Theon could just easily have slit his throat. Book!Ramsey would never have risked that, and book!Theon suffered a great deal more torture than in the show.
Â 
4. Fake!Arya . If there's going to be a fake!Arya in the show, there's no sign so far. If there isn't one, then Theon's arc will be running into big problems.
Â 
5. Attack on Moat Cailin. Well, they are doing this, strangely enough. I suppose it will be the same as in the books, but who will Ramsey welcome with the bunch of flayed men on poles? Maybe some Frey?
Â 
6. Yara's attack on the dreadfort. This is the part that I'm totally CLUELESS about. Locke, Ramsey and Theon are leaving, but Roose and his wife will still be there and ??? Really I have NO CLUE.
Â 
7. The Northern lords are still missing. No Ramsey meeting with Arnolf Karstark and Hother Umber, no word of Roose's alliance with Dustins and Ryswells, no Manderly, the Hornwood thing isn't in the show. They basically don't exist and at this point I wonder if they ever will. One possibility that occurred to me is that 'Miranda' = Lady Dustin . Totally dumb I know but it would make some kind of sense if they play it right...
Â 
Ok discuss..
4361	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-15	Â 
Â 
3. Theon. I get that they wanted to show how Theon is totally obedient to Ramsey now, but the shaving scene doesn't make any sense. Theon could just easily have slit his throat. Book!Ramsey would never have risked that, and book!Theon suffered a great deal more torture than in the show.


Â 
The shaving scene does make sense. As you say, Show!Theon has had far less torture than the book - and yet they cop flack for all the 'pointless torture porn' last season. The shaving scene demonstrates that Theon is actually Ramsay's thrall in a far better way than having him mutter 'I must remember my name' ad infinitum.Â
4362	Sarah Lannister	2014-04-15	I wonder if they'll try to pass Myranda off as FArya.Â  Not sure how she's comparable to Lady Dustin.Â  It's been the Bolton's first scenes this season, I'd say there's time to develop such things, but they could omit some too.
Â 
Not sure what's going to happen with Asha.Â  Stannis, or his forces could pick her up, or maybe the Boltons capture her and try to wed her to Ramsay.
4363	Ice_and_Fire	2014-04-15	I liked the shaving scene, and didn't think it was out of character for Book Ramsey, he always seemed 100% sure that Reek was his so though it worked well for the tv show.
The attack on Moat Cailin has got me a little confused now that Roose is already at the Dreadfort. I wonder if this is to show a bit more character development for Ramsey, how his father treats him for not being a 'Bolton'.Â 
Â 
I am also completely lost with the Asha/Yara attack on the dreadfort, and wondering how the Iron Islands story will fit in around that.Â
4364	Konradsmith	2014-04-15	^Well, Roose said that he had to smuggle himself into his own lands. So the Ironborn are still blocking the Neck, which means that Moat Caillin needs to be retaken to open the passage again. Then the bulk of Roose's troops can actually return home.
Â 
As for how the Iron Islands story will play out, we can only guess.

4365	Daske	2014-04-15	3. Theon. I get that they wanted to show how Theon is totally obedient to Ramsey now, but the shaving scene doesn't make any sense. Theon could just easily have slit his throat. Book!Ramsey would never have risked that, and book!Theon suffered a great deal more torture than in the show.


Â 
That it seems like it is a crazy move is shown by Roose - who is clearly unsure what the heck he is up to (but notice doesn't try to stop him!).
Â 
But it makes perfect sense. Ramsey is such a genius at psychological torture aswell as physical torture that he knows that Theon is incapable of making that move. It's extreme brainwashing.- I think we are meant to assume that more mental torture went on after the physical torture we saw to really break him.Â And after all, he's Reek now, not Theon, and Reek does not have the will to do that deed to his master.
Â 
Edit: Just remembered what this reminded me of. Isn't there a bit in Cool Hand Luke where the head warden thinks he has broken Luke so completely that he let's him go fetch his rifle from the lorry? Similar sort of thing.

4366	protar	2014-04-15	I wonder if they'll try to pass Myranda off as FArya.Â  Not sure how she's comparable to Lady Dustin.Â  It's been the Bolton's first scenes this season, I'd say there's time to develop such things, but they could omit some too.
Â 
Not sure what's going to happen with Asha.Â  Stannis, or his forces could pick her up, or maybe the Boltons capture her and try to wed her to Ramsay.


Â 
I really hope Myranda doesn't replace Farya now she's been established as a complete psychopath. In S3 there was a bit of a possibility that she was faking her psychopathy because Ramsay forced her. Now, not so much. Farya needs to be an innocent, she can't be one of Ramsay's accomplices otherwise Theon saving her makes no sense.
4367	Konradsmith	2014-04-15	She won't be FArya. She'll die this season.
4368	I'll pay the iron price	2014-04-15	I actually like the Psycho girlfriend arc, as for the shaving scene...............I suppose it shows to the viewers that Theon is totally broken and is suffering from extreme Stockholm Syndrome!
4369	Dornishwoman's Husband	2014-04-15	Now that Joffrey is dead, Ramsay will take the role of the best villain in the series. He shall surpass Joffrey in everything.
4370	Charles Phipps	2014-04-15	I dunno, I find Ramsey less enjoyable than Joffrey.
Â 
The appeal of Joffrey was that he looked normal but was a psycho underneath.
Ramsey can't conceal what a complete lunatic he is.
Â 
Joffrey is Bundy, Ramsey is Manson.
4371	King Tommen	2014-04-15	1.Locke is not going to hunt Rickon and Osha, he's going to the Wall on Roose's orders to infiltrate the NW in order to get to Jon as the Boltons believe that Jon is either harboring or knows where Bran and Rickon are.Â  Locke also has a built-in excuse to take the black as he can tell Jon that he was the one that cut off Jaime's hand and got sent to the Wall as punishment which will most likely endear him to Jon.
Â 
2. Myranda is not FArya. She's replacing Ramsay's boys.Â  Most likely he'll grow bored with her and turn on her later this season. Stephanie Blacker is the actress who played "Violet" last season (the blonde teasing Theon with Myranda). She was supposed to be in this season but couldn't participate because she was pregnant. I imagine that "Tansy" (you can hear Ramsay call her name on the hunt) is kind of supposed to be her (or an equivalent accomplice) even though she goes by a different name, the resemblance is too similar not for that to be the implication.
Â 
3. Roose still needs to bring his army through the Neck and needs Moat Cailin to surrender in order to do so. He had to smuggle his small group into the North to get to the Dreadfort. He was planning on ransoming Theon back to Balon in order to make this happen. Since Ramsay already tried that and Balon refused, Roose is letting Ramsay and Theon take a crack at liberating Moat Cailin themselves, which will most likely fall very closely to book events.Â  After that, Roose will be able to move his army into the North and eventually Winterfell in S5.
Â 
4. Yara's attack will either come very soon before Ramsay leaves for Moat Cailin (since we can tell both Ramsay and Theon are there when it happens) or possibly it occurs right at the end of the season after all the Moat Cailin stuff and Ramsay/Theon have returned to the Dreadfort.Â  Whatever happens here will go a long way in determining what Yara is going to be doing in S5.
Â 
5. They aren't going to have any significant Northern lords on the show (maybe extras standing around in the background) except for Manderly who is important. He'll be the face of the Northern lords, kind of like how the Greatjon represented them in S1. They don't need to introduce him until S5 though since that's when the Winterfell stuff will occur.Â  I'm certain they won't bother with Arnolf Karstark or any of that stuff as it's not really that important.Â  They have to consolidate their characters and find ways not to have the cast balloon out to 300 people.
4372	'96Buck	2014-04-15	Â

The shaving scene demonstrates that Theon is actually Ramsay's thrall in a far better way than having him mutter 'I must remember my name' ad infinitum.Â 


Agree...the whole point of the scene is to show that Theon WOULDNT (since he didn't) cut his throat "at that point."
4373	'96Buck	2014-04-15	With respect to Locke, we know in the book that there are Bolton men searching for the boys.Â  We certainly can't know that none of them were named Locke since they aren't named to a POV character.Â  Whether he's going to take the black or just go to Castle Black to look for the boys, it's a pretty obvious move.Â 
Â 
I daresay SOMEONE from the Dreadfort would have gone to Castle Black and looked, if they were looking for them generally, even if Snow were NOT there (or not known to anyone in Ramsay's command, which seems unlikely).Â  Presumably they looked in all of the population centers...that is generally how you look for people.

Â 


Â  Violet and Tansy are both blonde and young, but I think they are suppose to be two separate people. It doesn't make sense to me that they'd go out of their way to cast an actress who looks like same as Violet, and thus meant to be Violet,Â just to call her 'Tansy' instead of Violet. Ramsay has an entire harem of women, and I think Tansy was someone we've never seen before.

4375	Daenerys Must Die	2014-04-15	Until Ramsay and Jon Snow (which is still probably 10 episodes down the line) start to build up toward a sort of plot/feud I can't see show watchers hating him all that much because they aren't really led to believe he is anything more than a bit of side-show at the moment..
Â 
As for the hunt the actress being hunted is not the same as the one from last season (she's pregnant I believe so couldn't return) but I think it's safe to assume that by all accounts it's meant to be the same character.. Rambo's gotten bored which definitely causes a lot of confusion - they could build Myranda up a bit then kill her off to paint the full picture.

4376	Asshai by the Shadow	2014-04-15	Ramsay is not going to easily replace Joffrey because so far he's not hurting anyone the audience really cares about. In the show,Joffrey hurts Sansa, has her direwolf put down, antagonizes Tyrion,etc... so people despise him. Ramsay is hurting random girls and Theon so people don't care as much they just see him as a psycho. They will only truly hate him if he marries FArya and treats her like in the books because she's so innocent and if when he sends that letter to Jon because people love Jon.
4377	Hath4	2014-04-15	Well ramsay did burn winterfell and killed all it's people. So he has hurt the Starks in terrible ways.

Only we know this though unfortunately.. People still think "Theon is getting what he deserves" for killing the millers' boys even if it was FReek to begin with..

Only we know this though unfortunately.. People still think "Theon is getting what he deserves" for killing the millers' boys even if it was FReek to begin with..


Â 
In both the show and the books, it was Theon who ordered the murder of the miller's boys; so his is the responsibility. Â He did not, in my opinion, deserve to be tortured for months for that crime, a quick death would have been justice.
4380	Janicia	2014-04-15	The shaving scene gave a lot of insight into Theon's state, but it said just as much about Ramsay and also gave insights into Roose. Â Roose, yet again pointing out that somebody is doing something stupid but letting them do it anyway, even though Ramsay is his only living son. Â Ramsay being a risk taker, very confident in his work as he Â goads Theon with the razor to his throat, but also really wanting to impress Roose with his mastery. Â Roose is impressed. Â And poor Theon is completely broken but not numb. Â Â
4381	yushkevitch	2014-04-15	I actually like the Psycho girlfriend arc, as for the shaving scene...............I suppose it shows to the viewers that Theon is totally broken and is suffering from extreme Stockholm Syndrome!


Â 
Not to nitpick - but clearly I will anyway - but Theon doesn't have Stockholm Syndrome, not even close.
Â 
He's completely terrified of Ramsay and his actions and words are done out of complete, mortal fear of the man. Specifically, Theon does not have any sympathy or "good" feelings towards Ramsay. There is no love, admiration or (positive) emotional bond which is the trademark of Stockholm Syndrome.

I don't remember hearing, in the show, that Ramsay killed all the people of Winterfell down to the scullery maids and stable-boys - did he? Â I don't think he did in the book; I think he sent the surviving servants to serve at the Dreadfort; so I have hope that Beth Cassel and even Old Nan might still turn up alive. Â Â
4383	Hath4	2014-04-15	In the books ramsay did take a few women back to the dreadfort. most famously kyra who he manipulated into escaping with theon before he hunted them and kyra was eaten by his hounds. In the show he put the entire Winterfell  to the swords and in the books he killed like all most all of them so yeah.

The Reek plot from ACOK is missing from the show.
Its Dagmer who suggests the Millers boys be killed and I believe its Dagmer who does the deed.
I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t think the women were taken from Winterfell to the Dreadfort in the show because they were already dead at the Iron Borns hands.
I am really enjoying ShowRamsey... His face is always amazing.
IMO they should have done the Reek/Ramsey story in season 2, but they didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t for whatever reason.
The girl being hunted is just some random girl. Its not the girl from season 3. Different name, different acrtress.
Shaving scene was good. Great use of time to show the relationship between Ramsey, Roose and Reek.
4385	Hath4	2014-04-16	Not true after they knocked out theon the ironborn opened the gates and handed them over to ramsay, ramsay then flayed the ironborn living and killed the local population and burnt winterfell. Ramsay was responsible. Ironborn has nothing to due with the burning of winterfell that was all ramsay.

Â 
Violet and Tansy are both the names of flowers... I think that's a little wink from D&D Â Â to the viewer that they are meant to be the same character but they couldn't pull it off. Pretty certain Miranda will very soon suffer exactly the same fate because that's what Ramsey does, he builds people up and then pulls them down... He loves playing games.

4387	FNF	2014-04-16	I think this has been picked up by the majority of book readers- D&D don't do 'subtlety' very well. You can argue that in a visual medium you have to make things a little more obvious for the viewers and that they don't have enough time in the show to explain conflicts, feelings etc in the same depth that GRRM does. However, the shaving scene is just another example of D&D making it blatantly obvious that Theon is a broken man.
4388	Angmar	2014-04-16	It was a great scene, the with the shaving. It showed all three characters' psyque really good.
Â 
I'm not too fond of Ramsay now having "the Bastard's girls", but the more I see it i think Myranda will be gone mid-season or something, in another hunting scene just as brutal.
Â 
And Theon now limps.Â

4390	Beric175	2014-04-16	I love Ramsay on the show and that's because I knew that all the torture would eventually pay off with this show of absolute power by Ramsay over Theon. IfÂ Theon had just disappeared for a season and then reappeared as Reek,Â I don't know that people would feel empathy to the extent they do now that they have been through the torture with him. Also, Iwan Rheon is really selling me on the performance. He almost seems like a guy who forces himself to be happy when he does awful stuff, when in fact it seems like he is very angry over his father lording it over him that he's not a Bolton.
Â 
The weird Ramsay/Theon shippersÂ have toÂ get their ideas from somewhere. Just the way Ramsay is so possessive of Reek in the books (if only to inflict pain on him) might be an indication.
Â 
I think the Myranda stuff is interesting because serial killer couples are not unheard of (ex. the Moors murders) and she might be feeling high and mighty now but my guess is once Ramsay's legitimized he's gonna have a hunt to honour that....it's also interesting that it showcases his ability to manipulate people: he makes myranda think that she's being left out and so she gets jealous of the other girl and he just likes to see what happens as a result. In any case, he's gonna get his fun and I especially like the hunting scene for what we expect to see and what we get. We hear laughter first and so one might think something pleasant is going on when in fact it's anything but that. The extent of power Ramsay has over Reek is also showcased with the shaving scene and it serves to indicate to us that theon is broken (but not completely because he still flinches at the news of Robb Stark's death). Also, those are some big ass dogs and at least they get to bond with theon in the books.

He almost seems like a guy who forces himself to be happy when he does awful stuff, when in fact it seems like he is very angry over his father lording it over him that he's not a Bolton.
Â 
The weird Ramsay/Theon shippersÂ have toÂ get their ideas from somewhere. Just the way Ramsay is so possessive of Reek in the books (if only to inflict pain on him) might be an indication.
Â 
I think the Myranda stuff is interesting because serial killer couples are not unheard of (ex. the Moors murders) and she might be feeling high and mighty now but my guess is once Ramsay's legitimized he's gonna have a hunt to honour that....it's also interesting that it showcases his ability to manipulate people: he makes myranda think that she's being left out and so she gets jealous of the other girl and he just likes to see what happens as a result. In any case, he's gonna get his fun and I especially like the hunting scene for what we expect to see and what we get. We hear laughter first and so one might think something pleasant is going on when in fact it's anything but that. The extent of power Ramsay has over Reek is also showcased with the shaving scene and it serves to indicate to us that theon is broken (but not completely because he still flinches at the news of Robb Stark's death). Also, those are some big ass dogs and at least they get to bond with theon in the books.


I think he is genuine is his love for torture flaying and murder.Â its a joy to him. he is defently not forcing himself to be happy. though I agree he loves to have power over peopleÂ  you could see it with reek, also with tamseyÂ he could have sicked his bitches on her, but he stoppedÂ and let her beg for mercy. he loved that, he loved seeing the fear in her eyes. he is one sick man. as for myranda she probably appeals to him because she is also a psychopathic sadist. tamsey and other girls in the past that have fallen victim to the hunts were just doing what he said to stay alive. Myranda actually enjoys it.

Â 
I don't remember hearing, in the show, that Ramsay killed all the people of Winterfell down to the scullery maids and stable-boys - did he? Â I don't think he did in the book; I think he sent the surviving servants to serve at the Dreadfort; so I have hope that Beth Cassel and even Old Nan might still turn up alive. Â Â 


All of the men were killed and only the women were taken to the dreadfort, where they were subsequently killed off one by one via Ramsay's hunts.
Â 
Chances are, Beth and Old Nan are dead.

4394	Simon Steele	2014-04-15	I haven't read Storm of Swords in like ten years, so I can't remember if Cersei sending away Pycelle was in the book (it seems familiar), but I think this point of view hasn't been discussed much yet in terms of the show. But Cersei's little flaunting of her authority over the grand maester seems to have be lost in the shock that Joffrey is dead--will there be a fallout for her character that she sent away the one guy who might have been able to help Joffrey? I mean, most likely Pycelle couldn't have helped but I'm guessing there is significance in Cersei trying to express her authority by removing the only qualified medical expert from the wedding feast.
Â 
Even if this happened in the books it was a wasted point I feel like as Cersei never really saw her own inadvertent role in her son's death. Will the show make a bigger deal of this? I think it's kind of a great moment of irony, and so far people haven't seemed to really latch onto this as far as I can tell.
Â 
I also don't remember if the books have revealed Joff's poisoner, it's been a long time since I've read any of them (Dance of Dragons was years ago now too), and I am not implying Cersei had anything to do with it. I just kind of love that her ridiculous belief that she is smarter than everyone else, when she isn't, kind of was the last nail in Joffrey's coffin. This idiocy of her's definitely takes off in A Feast for Crows and Dance of Dragons, getting her imprisoned--I just hope the books kind of seize on this nice little tidbit.
4395	Indigocell	2014-04-16	I don't recall exactly how it went down in the books.Â  I do recall that Cersei began to favor Qyburn at some point, so this is one way of doing it.
4396	Ice_and_Fire	2014-04-16	No in the book Pycelle is present at the feast when Joff dies. There is a line about him shouting for help to go back to his chambers to get his potions, but the poison was so quick acting no one could have helped. I think it was more after Joff's death that Cersei began to become obviously unhinged, she couldn't seem to accept that her precious son could be killed while surrounded by his kingsguard and grand maester.
Â 
And the poison plot is revealed quite soon after the purple wedding, although I think there is still some debate on who physically put the poison in the chalice but we certainly find out who is behind it, where the poison was etc.Â
4397	Jaqen Hghar	2014-04-16	Yep, as I remember it, there are clear conclusions drawn by at least one POW character about who was responsible for the poisoning, even if I don't recall it being officially "spoken out", so it'll be interesting to see how it's dealt with in the show.

4510	cip	2014-04-14	My friend and I have been thinking about a couple of deviations from the books and how to tie them together.
Â 
At the end of ASoS Tyrion tells Jaime, that Cersei slept with Lancel and Osmund Kettleblack. But there is no Kettleblack in the series. So maybe they let Bronn take over the roles of the Kettleblacks. Let's see:
Â 
- Bronn tells Jaime this episode, that he sleeps with Sir Laygood's wife.
- Cersei had Qyburn give her medicine in E01. Perhaps to abort or avoid a pregnancy? This means, Cersei is already being unfaithful to him.Â 
Â 
- Ser Osmund is a sell sword, questionably sworn into knighthood, just as Bronn.
- Ser Osmund testifies against Tyrion in the books. Having Bronn testify against Tyrion would be big for Cersei.
Â 
- Shae was sent off by Tyrion and Bronn brings her to a ship. Bronn does not say Shae's shipped sailed away, he only says "She's gone."
- But Shae will (we hope!) betray Tyrion and testify against him, being found in Tywins bed some time after. So Bronn either lied or was negligent.
Â 
So maybe Bronn and Cersei are already sleeping with each other, and Cersei had Bronn bring Shae to her as a bargaining chip against Tyrion. Then, both Shae and Bronn will testify against Tyrion. Bronn will be sworn into the kingsguard and take on the role of the Kettleblacks moving forward.Â 
Â 
The only thing is, that Cersei doesn't have that much to gain from bedding Bronn prior to Joffreys death and we don't think he is the type of guy she would go for. Other than that, it would tie up a lot of the little missing things and we know that the writers love the Jerome Flynn and want to keep the cast smaller. So merging the Kettleblacks into Bronn makes sense from that perspective, as Bronn and Tyrion part ways at the end of the season anyway.
It would be an even bigger blow to TyrionÂ and make for an interesting dynamic with Jaime, as Bronn knows about Jaime's lack of swordsmanship with his left hand and trained with him.
Â 
What do you think?
4511	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-15	Cersei's lack of infidelity (since Lancel) has been a concern of mine.
4512	Konradsmith	2014-04-15	Not to be gossipy but apparently Lena Headey doesn't get along with Jerome Flynn at all (he's her ex) and won't talk to him on set. This is of course according to a British tabloid rag, but the source may well be true. If it is, then this would block the possibility of that potential character merge. Moreover, I doubt Cersei would sleep with someone so affiliated with Tyrion.
Â 
Of course, not all casting news leaks. For all we know they've already cast a Kettleblack as a bit part.
4513	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-15	She doesn't need to sleep with Bronn, though. Tyrion could say "she's been fucking Lancel, Bronn and the whole castle for what I care!".
4514	PhoenixFlame	2014-04-15	Maybe aspects are composited into Bronn's character? I'm just hoping they keep in Bronn's pwnage scene from AFFC.Â 
					
					
							Edited by PhoenixFlame, 15 April 2014 - 01:10 AM.
4515	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-15	Really can't see Cersei sleeping with Bronn (for both characters). I'm not convinced that Bronn will betray Tyrion. Refuse to champion for him? Yes. But to knowingly put Shae in the wrong hands, or testify against him... I just find that hard to believe. I think it will play out the same as in the books, except with Bronn taking Ilyn Payne's role in Jaime's Riverland adventures.Â 
Â 
I think the Kettleblack merge is an interesting theory, though!

4516	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-15	I agree with others, I don't really see Cersei fucking Tyrion's creature. I do think he could be in Littlefinger's payroll, as the Kettleblacks.
Â 
But if anything, I think Lancel will take on most of the role of the Kettleblacks: murdering the High Septon, attempting to seduce Margaery, being questioned/tortured by the Faith, and then he could also have his religious conversion.
Â 
Besides, the Kettleblacks are now in a cell, and unless Cersei comes back to power and releases them I don't see what big part they could play in future books.
Â 
I'd like Bronn to go the Stokeworth route, mainly because him naming his son Tyrion is hilarious and because it would be a great irony if he and Tyrion meet again, this times with the roles reversed: Tyrion as the sellsword (since he joined the Second Sons) and Bronn as the lord

Â 
But wasn't that 'son' actually the child born of rape during that time the crowd rioted when Myrcella was taken to Dorne? We haven't seen the Stokeworths since season 2? It's going to be awkward to bring them back now and have Bronn marry Lollys at this point as a lot more time seems to have passed by now. Cersei arranging for Bronn to marry Lollys as another tactic to keep him from defending Tyrion was one of my favorite facepalm moments in the books about his character and I'm wondering how they'll play out his story now.
Â 
I also do not think he'll replace Osmund Kettleblack as he's had absolutely no contact with Cersei at all that we've seen and it would seem really odd and out of place at this point.
Â 
To be honest I'm not sure where Bronn's story is going to go once Tyrion's trial begins on the show. It will be interesting to see.Â
4518	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-04-15	I'm not sure about Bronn sleeping with Cersei, but I do suspect that he betrayed Tyrion off-screen in episode two. Why else lie about Shae getting away? Keeping in mind that Tywin at the breakfast said he wanted Shae brought to him before the wedding, I think Bronn was caught escorting Shae to the ship by Cersei and/or her soldiers. Bronn, naturally interested in preserving his skin, makes a deal to lie to Tyrion while Shae is put away for questioning later on.
4519	cip	2014-04-15	Exactly. Shae coming to the trial will play as a betrayal by Bronn either way now. Maybe he just didn't wait there until the ship sailed away and Cersei's agents took Shae after he left. But this would be a lackluster explanation.
Â 
So probably he already betrayed Tyrion for Cersei and/or Tywin. This makes it pretty easy for him to be sleeping with Cersei and enter the Kingsguard.
Â 
Also, given that Cersei has been sleeping with another man (I don't really count pitiful Lancel, as sleeping with him wouldn't have caused her to scream "Everything's changed" imo), you gotta wonder, who it is. Unless they want to introduce a new character (a Kettleblack), it needs to be some knight in Kings Landing. And I don't see anyone pretty in the Kingsguard.
Â 
Bronn is, as to his arrogance and skill, not that unlike Jaime and he hasn't been serving Tyrion for some time, when Tyrion was licking his wounds after Blackwater. The affair might have started then and there. Or it might have started after Tyrion sent Myrcella to Dorne, with Cersei hoping to gain information about Tyrion by bedding Bronn.
Â 
Lena and Jerome having had a fling is interesting in this context
4520	Mel_Rose	2014-04-15	Interesting idea. I think it's likely that the Kettleback character might not appear at all, and Bronn will take his place. I had figured that he will follow Jaime to the Riverlands, since he took over parts of Payne's role.
I find that the idea of Bronn betraying Tyrion actually makes me quite sad - esp in the show, they have such a good rapport. I am hoping that Varys told Cersei about Shae's leaving and she sent people to the ship.
4521	-Ghost-	2014-04-15	Theyre doing something different with Bronn's story, but I dont think its the Kettleblack role. Im not sure what it is but I think it will be good.
4522	I'll pay the iron price	2014-04-15	What if Tywin decided to buy Bronn to spite Tyrion?
4523	SeventySeven	2014-04-15	Cersei's lack of infidelity (since Lancel) has been a concern of mine.


Â 
This. And tbh I find it a bit weird they seem to be implying she's sleeping with someone now, because who is she even sleeping with? I think they're doing a better job this season with Cersei at least so far, because she doesn't spend all her time moping, she has spies, she hates Pycelle like in the books (honestly her relationship with Pycelle in the books is hilarious, I hope next season we get Lord Gyles as well so she can hate him for coughing), tries to outdo Margaery, calls herself the queen even when she isn't anymore etc, but the fact she tries to build a posse around her is a pretty big part of her character. She needs the Kettleblacks or a replacement of sorts, otherwise how are they going to follow her arc going forward?
Â 
With this said, imo Bronn will be Jaime's Ilyn Payne replacement, and will go to the Riverlands with him next season.

4524	Charles Phipps	2014-04-15	I think it makes sense for Bronn to be the new Kettleback but, oddly, I think Bronn is too smart to believably fall for Cersei and confess to murdering the High Septon.

4525	Dornishwoman's Husband	2014-04-15	I imagined Bronn could replace all of three Kettleblacks before, but now I think he will replace Ilyn Peyne and Adam Marbrand, and follow Jaime to Riverrun in the next season.
Â 
I think that Meryn Trant could be some kind of replacement for Kettleblack brothers. I imagine he admits his adultery with Cersei to High Sparrow while he hangs from the ceiling in the Sept of Baelor after he's scourged.
4526	Charles Phipps	2014-04-15	You could also forgo his religious conversion and have Lancel do it.
4527	SeventySeven	2014-04-15	I imagined Bronn could replace all of three Kettleblacks before, but now I think he will replace Ilyn Peyne and Adam Marbrand, and follow Jaime to Riverrun in the next season.

Â 
Yeah, I mean at this point he would be the only likely candidate. Although it's hard to imagine Cersei sending him to try and seduce Margaery, maybe by then they'll introduce someone else.
4528	'96Buck	2014-04-15	I agree with a lot of the comments above about the obstacles with the original proposal (not least, interestingly, the actors themselves), but Bronn is still looking to move up, it seems, mentioning that he wants a sigil.Â  Was obviously evasive w/ Tyrion regarding Shae.Â  He is building the relationship with Jaime now...I don't think Bronn's secret oceanside spot is unknown to Varys, and Varys needs some currency with Tywin, but only Cersei or Littlefinger would have been looking to flip Bronn up until now, though.Â  Tywin doesn't scheme against him and Jamie doesn't scheme at all.
Â 
Varys recognizes that Bronn is a big asset for Tyrion, and ultimately of course is NOT looking to stabilize the kingdom.Â  He knows that Tyrion actually would be good for the 7 kingdoms if he were in a position of influence.
4529	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-04-15	I'm pretty sure having Bronn be Jaime's sparring partner puts a big hole in this theory. Jaime wouldn't continue to train with Bronn if he suspected him to be fucking Cersei, and since it's obvious the show is putting emphasis on Jaime's re-training, I suspect Bronn will follow Jaime to the Riverlands and continue their sparring. Then again it would make for some pretty cool scenes to have Jaime training with a man he suspects to be fucking his love.

Yeah, training up to the point where he can beat him...then they switch to sharp swords...
Â 
Bronn might as well head to the Riverlands anyway; he doesn't have the Stokeworth estate to steal and has no obvious means of support w/o Tyrion.Â  Just some loot, or maybe even some minor estate in the Riverlands for good service would drive the ambitious up-jumped sellsword.

Â 
As much as I love the idea of Bronn and Jaime in a heated fight, I think it would be sort of a regression for Jaime's character to kill or wound the man for fucking Cersei. That's what the old Jaime would do.
4532	HairGrowsBack	2014-04-15	I honestly can't see it, but I also have hard time seeing him following Jaime in the Riverlands after refusing to fight for Tyrion, so...
I do agree that the lack of candidates for Cersei's lovers is problematic, though.
4533	JoramunsKazoo	2014-04-15	My belief is that Bronn will replace Ilyn Payne on Jaime's adventures out in the Riverlands.Â  Cersei would never bed a consort of her Imp brother.Â  Her paranoia will hang too heavily after Tyrion's escape.

Â 
Agreed.Â 
Â 
Cersei's infidelity should have been set-up a bit better, but they still have a little time to introduce it (for instance, if what she and Qyburn were discussing in 4x01 was moon tea).
4536	Talking Hodor	2014-04-15	I could totally see this happening.Â  Bronn is quite popular in the TV show, he's possibly in the employ of Littlefinger, and he would be perfectly situated to take over the roles of several minor book characters (Kettleblacks, Ilyn Payne, actual Bronn).
4537	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-04-15	Â 
Agreed.Â

Â 
Well we already know she was with Lancel while Jaime was away, and I don't think they needed to really reintroduce the idea in Season 3, since introducing complications and details to a story a year before anything becomes of it is generally bad for the show. People have a hard enough time keeping up with current events, so Cersei's infidelity is probably something they're only going to bother with this season. Certainly they hinted at it already, and I think we'll see a couple more hints, culminating with Tyrion dropping the bomb on Jaime at the end of the Season.Â
4538	Benjaario Starkharis	2014-04-15	I think Tywin bought Bronn back in season 1 when he arrived with Tyrion in the Lannister camp. He then planted Shae in Tyrion's tent to spy on Tyrion as know what he's going to to as Hand of the King. Everything that's happened between Shae and Tyrion was acting and she's been in Tywin's pocket all along. That's how I think the whole betrayal is going to unfold.

Â 
I smell another honeypot! I'd like this better than the "hell hath no fury" way it's unfolding currently though.Â
4541	ThunderG	2014-04-15	Bronn is a sellsword, so he would never join the kingsguard. IMHO it makes sense if he trains Jaime for money and leaves KL with him.
4542	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-04-15	Way too much time spent of Shae's genuine love for Tyrion and insecurity of being a whore to have her be a spy this whole time. More likely she's just bitter about Tyrion's rejection and offered very little choice but to testify against him.
4543	HairGrowsBack	2014-04-15	Bronn is a sellsword, so he would never join the kingsguard. IMHO it makes sense if he trains Jaime for money and leaves KL with him.


Yes but again, why would Jaime would tag along with the guy that refused to fight for his brother ? Granted, Bronn was justified not to, but it strikes me as strange that Jaime wouldn't be at least slightly bitter about it.
4544	Frumpus	2014-04-15	Is Lancel even on the show this season? I was surprised he wasn't at the purple wedding and he was absent last season.
4545	Chebyshov	2014-04-15	Is Lancel even on the show this season? I was surprised he wasn't at the purple wedding and he was absent last season.


Â 
No, and according to his wiki page, he's just a character in seasons 1&2.Â http://gameofthrones...ancel_Lannister
Â 
I wonder if they'll keep Jaime's run-in with him the same.
4546	The 10th Penny King	2014-04-15	Something definitely happened when Bronn walked Shae to that boat.Â  The words he used afterward were specific and deliberate.Â  I think he is definitely involved with keeping Shae in Kings Landing, but don't think he's sexing Cersei.
Â 
It would be hardcore though if Bronn would completely betray Tyrion as well.
4547	REVEALnothing	2014-04-15	Is bron liying to Jamiy as well about Ser Laygoog, Thunderbolt on their shield? Baric Dondarion? or am i just reading too much into it?
4548	Sun	2014-04-15	I doubt it. I think Bronne will leave KL with Jaime. He'll be the character in whom Jaime confides his thoughts for us to hear them, pretty much the same role he played for Tyrion when no other significant character was around.Â 

					
					
							Edited by Sun, 15 April 2014 - 01:28 PM.
4549	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-15	Nah, I can't see Cersei putting any trust in him when he's been connected to Tyrion for so long. He'll likely fulfill Ilyn's role in S5 in that he'll travel to the Riverlands with Jaime. Since there'll be a lot of storylines going on there, that could further alter his storyline as it progresses, due to the fact we don't know if he'll be important in TWOW.
4550	I'll pay the iron price	2014-04-15	Jaime and Bronn would be a great pairing and we fans cant get enough of Bronn's witty one linersÂ
4551	King of the Road	2014-04-15	I reckon Varys is the new Kettleblack.
4552	Dragon's Bane	2014-04-15	I reckon Varys is the new Kettleblack.

4553	Ned's Sword	2014-04-06	here it is folks, the promo for next week's episode
Â 
http://www.youtube.c...h?v=YZd7okKkGmI
Â 
i hope this is the right subforum
4554	Rashtibram	2014-04-07	I'm really not a fan of this new promo layout, I have to say. The music just seems off somehow, and the new 'Game of Thrones' logo looks weirdly too festive: I preferred the eerie drum music from the season 3 previews, and the logo set against a black/dark green backgroundâ<U+0080>¦but whatever. The next episode looks pretty damn amazing (it's been hailed by certain critics as one of the best hours of the show to date).
Â 
I think we all know what to expect from next week, anyway (at least in terms of the KL arc) so I'll list some stray observations:
Â 
â<U+0080><U+0093> Ramsay's hunt looks like it's going to be in this episode, as well as maybe his interactions with Roose? Apparently the hunt is the last thing that truly breaks Theon/Reek, so I'm simultaneously apprehensive and excited to see how it plays out.
Â 
â<U+0080><U+0093> Bran's visions are in this episode, which pretty much confirms that the dragon-shadow flying over KL is one of them. I guess they found a way to write CH out.
Â 
â<U+0080><U+0093> I like that they kept some variation of the line "Handless and noseless, the Lannister boys."
Â 
â<U+0080><U+0093> I'm looking forward to Melisandre's interactions with Shireen, and getting a bit of much-needed exposition into the Great Other and R'hllor (and possibly Azor Ahai?)
4555	Konradsmith	2014-04-07	^Good analysis. I think it's likely that the Roose/Ramsay conversation we've seen will be next week. Also, yeah, this confirms that it will be Bran that sees the dragon image.
4556	aFeastForDragons	2014-04-07	I was wondering how they will fit in the Dragon part. Interesting and might also be a spoiler for TWOW/ADOS.Â
4557	Queen of Whores	2014-04-07	That quick bit of Shae (I think...) slapping Bronn is surprising. Nothing like that at all happens in the book, so I'll be interested to see what is happening there,
4558	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-04-07	Yeah finally Stannis.

He looks grumpy, which is good.Â
4559	Queen of Whores	2014-04-07	Yeah finally Stannis.
He looks grumpy, which is good.Â 


Â 
Haha, yep. On another thread I asked someone that had seen the episode, specifically "what is Stannis like during the burnings?" and she said he was pissed off and reluctant but determined, so... it looks like we're getting back a bit of the good ol' Stannis finally.
4560	aFeastForDragons	2014-04-07	^George wrote this episode so we should get some badass lines from Stannis. Also hopefully we get the cart before the horse speech from Davos.
4561	The hairy bear	2014-04-07	I also look forward to Jaime +Tyrion and Jaime+Bronn, written by GRRM. I recall that in one SSM he said that while waiting ASOS he initially considered having Jaime arrive at KL before Joffrey's wedding. I wonder if he'll recycle dialogues or concepts that he envisioned back then for those scenes.
Â 
It seems that we'll have most of the storylines that were dropped from E1: Bran, Dragonstone, and Dreadfort. I guess that we are not going to have Arya, Jon, and wildling, since their stories were left at an adequate stopping point.
Â 
As per the dragon's shadows over KL, it can only be a dream, and my main guess is Dany. But perhaps it could be one of Melisandre's visions: she "sees in the flames" three dragons over KL, and they try to wake them by burning three people alive.
4562	Hath4	2014-04-07	George wrote the kings landing bran and ramsay reek scenes for this episode. The dragonstone scenes were originally in episode 1 but then moved to episode 2.
4563	Lord Alistair	2014-04-07	Â 
Â 
â<U+0080><U+0093> Ramsay's hunt looks like it's going to be in this episode, as well as maybe his interactions with Roose? Apparently the hunt is the last thing that truly breaks Theon/Reek, so I'm simultaneously apprehensive and excited to see how it plays out.
Â 
Â 


As much as I can't wait for the Roose/Ramsey scene, I doubt they will be showing the hunt + Moat Cailin + return to Dreadfort all in one episode (wouldn't be surprised however to be in 2 episodes and I can't wait )Â 
Also love that they have added the dreadfort into the oepning credits, always awesome to see art/depictions of places that havn't really been described in any real detail.Â 

					
					
							Edited by Lord Alistair, 07 April 2014 - 06:45 AM.
4564	Hath4	2014-04-07	Moat cailin will be later in the season probably episode 8. roose comes to the dreadfort early in the season leaves then they meet up again at the end of the season. The actor who plays roose said he is not in a lot of the episodes so this is the  most likely  outcome.
4565	Azor Ahoy!	2014-04-07	STANNIS! STANNIS! STANNIS! by the way Boltons! And of course the one true king Joffrey!
Â 
Can't wait, had way too much KL this ep. Joffrey is my favorite part of KL.
4566	Shaldun	2014-04-07	STANNIS! STANNIS! STANNIS! by the way Boltons! And of course the one true king Joffrey!
Â 
Can't wait, had way too much KL this ep. Joffrey is my favorite part of KL.


That won't change next week though. According to the promo, Stannis', Bran's and Bolton's storylines are in the episode and the rest is King's Landing. I suppose Arya, the Wall + Wildlings and Dany won't be there or not all of them anyway.Â
4567	SuperTechmarine	2014-04-07	...no purple wedding?
Â 
Ho yeah. Can't wait for next week. Wine for everyone. The food will be so good, Joffrey will want to claw his own throat out.

					
					
							Edited by SuperTechmarine, 07 April 2014 - 08:28 AM.
4568	Lord Bored	2014-04-07	I doubt we'll see Roose. The episode will already be packed as it is without having to add his arrival to the Dreadfort into the mix. I see him coming in during Episode 3. 
We'll probably just be focusing on Ramsay's hunt.
4569	Hath4	2014-04-07	We will see some of roose, though it will be just him introducing fat walda  to ramsay.
					
					
							Edited by Hath4, 07 April 2014 - 09:31 AM.
4570	Queen of Whores	2014-04-07	What I don't understand is how they can have Roose and Ramsay meet up before Theon clears out Moat Cailin. The entire reason for him clearing out Moat Cailin in the book was so Roose and his men could keep coming up North, but if he already apparently can.... what's the point of keeping Theon's mission in the show...?
4571	Hath4	2014-04-07	the show never established it as the gateway to the north so in the show there is probably another way to get back to the dread fort .  Roose will probably arrive with a small number then leave to reclaim the rest of his forces as well as the freys. A larger force would probably require them to take moat cailin.
4572	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-07	I really wanted to see Roose be a guest at the PW just so we could have a Tywin/Roose scene but I guess that was never really going to happen.Â 
Â 
I'm really looking forward for Cersei's crazed mother reaction (can she top Catelyn?) and how they tackle Bran's visions.Â 
Â 
I like how Ramsay is in this episode too- he's pretty much gong to take the most hated/annoying character title from Joff.Â 
Â 
I've got to say, I'm not really a big fan of this new promo lay out either. I really liked the way Season 3 promos were laid out- especially the 3x10 (Mhysa) promo with flashes of the RW aftermath and 'the Northerners will never forget' line. It was very effective and haunting.Â

Â 
I'm fairly interested in that too. I want to hear what Bronn says that incites a slap from Shae. Probably some clever comment of Tyrion fucking Sansa and Shae not being needed anymore, after which he probably asks her to fuck him instead.
Â 
Â 
So excited for the next episode. Written by GRRM.
Stannis, Bran, Ramsay return.
And a certain Wedding.Â  
Â 
After this episode though, I'm gonna stop watching until after the season is over. Then I'll binge watch the entire season.
10 hours of extreme pleasure.

Yes it's what I think too. It will take some time surely (several scenes) in a packed episode with the events of KL and some Stannis and Bran (plus, Dany or Arya or the Wall/Wildlings ?).Â 
Â 
Also, I don't really see Ramsay doing his hunts with his father here. I know Roose isn't a good person and knows what Ramsay is doing probably but I don't see him authorizing that. That doesn't strike me as his type.Â 
Â 


I really wanted to see Roose be a guest at the PW just so we could have a Tywin/Roose scene but I guess that was never really going to happen.Â 
Â 
I'm really looking forward for Cersei's crazed mother reaction (can she top Catelyn?) and how they tackle Bran's visions.Â 


Â 
Yes it would have been so great written by GRRM in addition. There's no rush to make him come back to the Dreadfort, they should have done that. But I suppose the problem is that Roose hasn't the teleporter of Littlefinger with him and the Twins is not next to KL.


Â 
After this episode though, I'm gonna stop watching until after the season is over. Then I'll binge watch the entire season.
10 hours of extreme pleasure.


You're brave to being able to not watch it immediately. I prefer the one-hour of pleasure each week followed by a week of dying to see the next one. At the end of the season (not immediately after though), there will be 40 hours of extreme pleasure with a binge watching since season 1. I hope to bring my girlfriend in the show with this future visionning.

The hunt will happen before roose arrives. Alex Graves is directing both Episodes 2 and 3. WIC ( the source I assume you're referring to) reported Walda's casting before the director for Episode 3 and most other episodes were released so the guys over at WIC more than likely just assumed she was set for episode 2 since Graves was already confirmed as the director for that particular episode then at that point in time. They've made mistakes, it's not like they've been 100% flawless in their reporting (thst wouldn't be realistic)
But yeah, her official CV says nothing from what I can see about which episode she appears in specifically, just that it's being directed by Graves.

To be fair, even though some of the Stanstans get carried away, there are valid reasons for not being satisfied with HBO's adaption of the character. I'm definitely concerned about the burnings coming up next week, seeing as they look like completely innocent people, which is a farcry from what actually goes down midway through SoS.
4587	Drogo_1	2014-04-07	So no Cold Hands?

Â 
I reckon so - television license. Â When Ramsay was torturing Theon at the end of season 3, Theon begged him to kill him and Ramsay pointedly said that they still have a use for him. Â I reckon they'll bring the 'Arya' marriage story forward (minus the Jeyne backstory, or at least a shortened version of it if they do it at all - since she'll have to be a northerer of about the same age), and it'll show that Roose's plan all along was to marry the 'last Stark' to his son and make him Lord of Winterfell. Â It's a quicker plan to explain on television.
Â 
It'd make sense to the pace of the show if they just went straight to that instead of doing the Moat Cailin ruse.
4590	Konradsmith	2014-04-07	D and D probably wrote some of the Stannis scenes but that doesn't mean that GrrM didn't write any of them. Our evidence that at one point Stannis was in the premiere script is that Carice van Houten showed a picture of script 401 back in the early summer. Now maybe GrrM DID write all of the Stan scenes and she got it simply as a formality. We'll find out whenever people in the production clarify who wrote which scenes, which they often do during the commentaries. Perhaps we'll find out earlier but let's not use this as "D and D ____ Stannis" just yet, alright?
Â 
Actually I think it's likely that Mel clarifying to Shireen about there only being one hell (and from Gran de Lys we know, she is generally talking about the R'hollor religion) is written by GrrM. He often puts world-building into his episodes to catch up the unsullied with things that hadn't been adequately explained prior, like the weirwood explanation in "the Pointy End" for example.
Â 
Another thing. Roose WILL appear in "the Lion and the Rose". We've known that since "the Bastards of Westeros" feature aired. That feature showed a clip of Roose introducing Fat Walda to Ramsay, which since we know from her casting info that the lady playing Fat Walda appears only in ep. 2, confirms this scene will be next week.

This jumped out at me as well. I remember in the books Shae begs and begs to go to the wedding and I'm guessing she's going to get even more upset in the show when Tyrion says no, so upset perhaps that Bronn has to step in.Â

4593	bobbybuilderton	2014-04-07	Spoiler So, if you're quick you can catch that Sansa does wear the necklace to the wedding. So I just wonder how they'll get the poison into the wine. Unless Dontos is a red herring for readers to think they know what's coming. I wouldn't be surprised if they tried to simplify her escape for people to understand exactly who was involved in the planning. Also, we saw Tommen in this promo. Dude's a giant, definitely aged up. About as tall as Tywin. Seems to have more of a chubby, boyish, beta male face though. Cersei also seems to be genuinely smiling in the background of the clip where Joffrey holds the sword.

Also there are a lot of a amazing scenes they could build up with him, like the 2nd massacre at Craster's Keep etc... IMO it would be a complete waste not adding him. I'm really hoping that they are just hiding him for now...
4595	ovis alba	2014-04-07	I'm actually curious about what they are going to do with Bran the next season(s).
Compared to the books he is already extremly far in his story, more than any other character. He might probably be a good tool to tie in some of the historical parts that have been skipped in the show so far.

He often puts world-building into his episodes to catch up the unsullied with things that hadn't been adequately explained prior, like the weirwood explanation in "the Pointy End" for example.
Â 
Another thing. Roose WILL appear in "the Lion and the Rose". We've known that since "the Bastards of Westeros" feature aired. That feature showed a clip of Roose introducing Fat Walda to Ramsay, which since we know from her casting info that the lady playing Fat Walda appears only in ep. 2, confirms this scene will be next week.
Again, Alex Graves is directing Episodes 2 AND 3.  WIC published the Fat Walda casting report before the director of Episode 3 was officially revealed online.
4597	Chebyshov	2014-04-07	What is up with the Weirwoods? There doesn't look to be any red sap in the promo coming from the eyes. I know it's nitpicky, but it's the old gods.
4598	The Giver	2014-04-07	Which is funny, because if I remember correctly, when Jon and Sam took their vows before a Weirwood, it had red sap.
4599	go joff go	2014-04-07	So, if you're quick you can catch that Sansa does wear the necklace to the wedding. So I just wonder how they'll get the poison into the wine. Unless Dontos is a red herring for readers to think they know what's coming. I wouldn't be surprised if they tried to simplify her escape for people to understand exactly who was involved in the planning. Also, we saw Tommen in this promo. Dude's a giant, definitely aged up. About as tall as Tywin. Seems to have more of a chubby, boyish, beta male face though. Cersei also seems to be genuinely smiling in the background of the clip where Joffrey holds the sword.
Â 
I wanted to put this in spoiler tags because I don't know the rules for the promo threads, but I can't seem to find them... wow dude just ruin it for everyone
4600	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-07	So, is that Shae slapping Bronn in the preview?
Â 
Also... dragon over KL. Finally getting into Bran's visions, it seems!
4601	bobbybuilderton	2014-04-07	wow dude just ruin it for everyone


I'm not trying to though, I pretty explicitly said I wanted to put it in spoiler tags but when I went to edit I couldn't find them. Do I have to type it in? It's been a while since I posted on a no spoiler thread, which this isn't labeled as. Not in the title and not in the OP.
Â 
Okay I looked around for how to do spoiler tags and I have fixed it. I'm sorry if I spoiled something for you or others =/

â<U+0080><U+0093> Ramsay's hunt looks like it's going to be in this episode, as well as maybe his interactions with Roose? Apparently the hunt is the last thing that truly breaks Theon/Reek, so I'm simultaneously apprehensive and excited to see how it plays out.


Â 
Can't be worse than the Bolton slumber party...Â 
Â 
Haha, with you on the "excited + apprehensive." Roose Bolton's actor said one scene between him and Ramsay was totally sad.Â 
Â 
Â 



I'll be really mad if they don't add CH. It's not like its hard to find an actor to make his role, he wouldn't even need to show his face. Also there are a lot of a amazing scenes they could build up with him, like the 2nd massacre at Craster's Keep etc... IMO it would be a complete waste not adding him. I'm really hoping that they are just hiding him for now...



I think Sam's actor said they cut him. IMO he serves no crucial purpose. Meera and Summer can fight off baddies, Bran and Jojen navigate with greendreams.Â

Are you thinking of Rickon? Tommon is Cersei's youngest, but he's supposed to be 8.
I'm assuming the change is so when

I second that. It will be hilarious. Anyone else care to speculate on Shae slapping Bronn? I originally said maybe he's there to restrain her from going to the wedding since she wanted to go so bad. But maybe Tyrion proposes she marry Bronn lol. Whatever it is I'm predicting it's the final straw.

4618	sati	2014-04-08	Tommen is a freaking giant. What they were thinking with this casting? :/ He looks older than Joff.
4619	Rhaquentis	2014-04-08	It looks like the wedding will consist of two parts? I see some difference in Sansa's attire, one scene with a simple dress and without the necklace, and another with a better dress and hairdo, plus necklace.
4620	Queen of Whores	2014-04-08	It looks like the wedding will consist of two parts? I see some difference in Sansa's attire, one scene with a simple dress and without the necklace, and another with a better dress and hairdo, plus necklace.

In the books there is a breakfast they all go to in the morning, where Joffrey destroys the book Tyrion gives him, then they have a break for an hour or so, get changed and go to the wedding ceremony and then the feast, which starts at midday I believe. So that's probably why Sansa is dressed differently.
4621	The Monkey	2014-04-08	How can Roose visit the Dreamfort if they haven't cleared the Ironborn scum at Moat Collin? I suppose he can take a ship, but what's the point of that? They're gonna have to clear it at some point.
4622	Vvornth	2014-04-08	The purple wedding in the next episode already?
Â 

	Spoiler This means Tyrion will spend most of the season in chains.
It also means there will be no build up with Dontos as "Florian" and Sansa holding out hope.
Of course what follows is that the show will likely incorporate more elements of The Vale this season which is welcome.
Â 
I suspect Shae slapping Bronn is a play to getting her more alienated to the audience. Something to justify her being killed by Tyrion more later in the show.

That'd be a hilarious name for it.
4626	Shaldun	2014-04-08	Tommen is freaking tall. And the actor is likely in growth phase considering his age. He seems almost taller than Cersei already. In season 5, we'll have a teenager around 15-16, I suppose they'll change its story because he can't play with cats and all at his age. But the point of Tommen is to be this boy king that the Tyrells can easily played to love them and against his mother. Here, Tommen is like what was Joffrey in season 1, he can almost rule in his own name and marry Marg immediately. Also, when we see him in season 2 (that's the last time right ?), he's a small kid around 7-8 years old IIRC. 2 seasons later, he's like 13-14 years old or more. That the kind of inconstenscy that is a problem when you watch all seasons back to back. The recasts of the Mountain and Darrio are already bothering but this one is far worst as it changes completely the character and the story of KL. I don't understand why they have done that.Â

No, I mean Tommen. He got tall! He played a little Lannister last season and he was a wee tot cutely asking about Robb being a werewolf. For some weird reason his expression/face reminded me of Kuja. Except not psychotic.Â

Â 
Ahh, the Dreamfort. Where there's nothing but lollipops and sunshine.
Â 
Ignoring the fact that the show never established Moat Cailin (or Moat Collin) as the gateway to the North, I think even in book canon, there would presumably be a method of bringing a small party into the North without bypassing that spot (backroads and whatnot). If you're trying to march an army through, then yeah, you need to deal with Moat Cailin. But this is clearly not what Roose is doing in this episode. And we know that Theon is sent to Moat Cailin to get their surrender later on this season so presumably that would be so Roose could bring his entire host through at that time.

4658	Queen of Whores	2014-04-08	Every child in the show was aged up. It all went smoothly. Why is Tommen all of a sudden an issue?

Because his age is actually important to the plot. The reason Cersei got away with so much dumb shit and why the Tyrells can keep using him easily is because Tommen in the books is very young and naive, so it's easier to manipulate him. In the show, he looks like he's about 14 or 15, so that isn't gonna be the case, unless they want to make him look really stupid. Also, because of his young age in the books, he wasn't able to consummate the marriage to Margaery, and that may have some plot relevance because of the trials coming up in Winds. In the show it looks like he would be able to consummate the marriage, so.... ageing him up this much creates a few problems.

I'm 28 years old and my brother is 13. I'm 6'2 and wear a size 13 shoe. Last time I went home I left with a pair of his shoes because he didn't like them and they fit me and he was my exact height. Tommen is tall and chunky. The situation can play out just fine.
4660	Ser Blake	2014-04-08	Tommem and Bran are the same age.Â  If Bran looks like a teenager then it would be weird to recast Tommen as a small child.Â  Just because he is old/tall doesn't mean he can't be still be sweet, soft and malleable.Â  There are plenty of 13 year olds whoÂ  look grown up, but are still pushover mamma boys.

what matters is his personality. As long as he's a punk who was terrorized by Joffrey and is the extreme opposite, it's fine. His lack of a spine is just that much more apparent.Â
4662	Ser Oromus Locke	2014-04-08	If they play Tommen as naAve then he'll be fine, considering Nathalie Dormer's.. performance.. In the books, Tommen is nine and Marge is seventeen. Roughly twice his age.. To be completely fair, Nathalie doesn't play Marge as if she's seventeen, more like she's nineteen/twenty-two.
Â 
Whatever the new age of Tommen might be, I think he'll stumble and stutter in the presence of Nathalie Dormer's.. performance, regardless if they made him look a tidbit older. The difference would probably still be noticable if Tommen is just a tall thirteen year old, barely having hit puberty and he probably doesn't even know he's starting to smell/sweat more, while Marge is completely experienced in every way.
Â 
Getting a bit personal here, but I was around 5'9" when I was twelve. If Nathalie Dormer walked up to me back then and started to invest interest in me, I would be clueless of her alterior motives as well as jibbering, stuttering and stumbling the entire time.. Now imagine if I was berated by the likes of a Joffrey my entire prior life - and thus have no spine? Then suddenly those three years upgrade don't seem to matter much to me.
Â 
If people are expecting a twelve-year-old to stand in the grace of Nathalie Dormer, expecting him to go full on suave and dirty on her - then they're missing some insight on how twelve-year-old boys have no clue whatsoever on how to behave/keep their cool around young women (not girls - but women, and especially when they move in 'flocks'). Or, I'm just getting old and kids are getting dirty and suave much earlier these days.. I heard reports of the average age of African American girls to hit pubesence is nine... Which is actually kind of frigthning because nine year old girls should not be able to have babies at all..
Â 
Either way, I'm not expecting Tommen to play with any type of pussycat in the series due to the age increase though.

Â 
Agreed. Like I said, I was just surprised after seeing him last season. I'm super curious to see how they write him.Â 
Â 
Plus, besides him not being really into girls yet, I doubt Margaery wants to bang him. She does her duty to her family, but if Olenna says "pfft, he's a baby, let's just troll Cersei for a couple years," she'd be in favor. Playing with kittens vs. nodding and smiling at threats to murder her gay brother. Yeaaaah....
4664	Grey Guardian	2014-04-09	Not sure if anyone mentioned, but apparently there was a scene this season that was so bloody and disgusting that it had to be toned down. My guess? A full flaying from Ramsay. Mixed feelings about this, because on one side I want to see it, but on the other side I really don't... Even though they've cut it, I wonder if they'll ever release the full version of the scene?Https://uk.tv.yahoo.com/game-thrones-bloody-season-four-scene-had-toned-141800039.html
4665	Rhaegar I Targaryen	2014-04-09	The passing of the "Most Hated" torch should occur, from Joffrey to Ramsay..Â
4666	Jinjonator	2014-04-09	What's wrong with kittens people I still played with them when I was fourteen cats are cute he can still have kittens.


He better. If we don't get Ser Pounce and Lady Whiskers, there's no point in even watching the show anymore tbh.
4667	mck	2014-04-09	Â 
I like how Ramsay is in this episode too- he's pretty much gong to take the most hated/annoying character title from Joff.Â 


Â 
How do you figure?
My friends and I absolutely hated Joff. Scum of the earth, but everyone who I have watched the show with Hates Theon just as much.
Ramsay's TV depiction was absolutely great. I found myself laughing at what his character was saying or doing more often than not (The sausage seen was great!)
.... Then again, everyone else LOOOOVES Dany, for reasons I cannot see. I find her dull and think she would make for a terrible leader, but that's beside the point. I would hope for everyone else's sake that they don't despise Ramsay nearly as much as they despised Joff.
4668	Rhaegar I Targaryen	2014-04-09	I think that Ramsay will be inflicting pain on a more innocent victim than Theon in episode 2..
4669	PhoenixFlame	2014-04-09	Now I'm painfully curious what exactly was "too disturbing" for HBO (besides a press release inspired by "hey guys, we're running short on prosthetic skin, we should scale back")

Probably the rape and flaying of Ramsay's female victim. I read that they changed it so he just sets the dogs on them, though that's still terrible, it's easier to cut the camera away and for us to still know what's going on. I imagine it will be done somewhat in the way it was in Django Unchained.
4671	jet199	2014-04-09	The passing of the "Most Hated" torch should occur, from Joffrey to Ramsay..Â  


Ramsay just looks too cute (in a boyish way) and is too funny for people to hate him like they hate Joff. Roose may get a lot of hate instead though.
Â 
The thing I really want to see though is who is sitting next to Tyrion at the wedding. There is someone in green (possible Tyrell) sitting next to him when he has the book which I guess is from the earlier gift-giving scene as Sansa is not wearing her nice new necklace. However I am betting Loras sits with them during the wedding. 
	Spoiler The Knight Of Flowers is tied with Sansa in my mind as the person who actually puts the poison in the cup. I mean kofÂ is a pretty weird way to spell cough.
4672	Hath4	2014-04-09	Probably the rape and flaying of Ramsay's female victim.

Being eaten alive by dogs is probably one of the worst ways to die so I wouldn't say that are toning it down it's just as terrible. I have a feeling those that thought he was cool last year will not find him so cool after hunting a girl and feeding her to his dogs that's just sick on so many levels.

Â 
I never said it wasn't terrible, I just said it's easier for them to get across what is going on without having to show it all.Â
4674	Hath4	2014-04-09	Yeah I agree I'm interested to see how they will handle it if the camera stays to long on the girl being torn apart that could easily turn people off and go into torture porn level. I have a feeling that for most of the shot the camera will be on reek and we will see his reaction.

This might be the other wedding, but in the books they have dancing afterwards and change partners every so often?

	Spoiler This would be an excellent way to make it ambiguous as to who delivers the poison.Â  So many characters interacting with Sansa which would generate many suspects.Â  It's probably unlikely and they'll probably go with the Queen of Thorns, Loras and Mace interacting with Sansa at some stage, to put suspicion on the Tyrells.
Â 
There should be a point at the end of the episode where Sansa realises something is missing from the necklace, but how do they establish that the gemstones are actually poison? Perhaps Littlefinger will reveal this detail to her in a later episode.

Â 
Regarding a much earlier event in this series:

	Spoiler Also, at this point during the books Tyrion implies to Joffrey that he knows that he sent someone to try and kill Bran with the dagger.Â  This is when Joffrey receives Widow's Wail (such an ironic name considering what happens later) and states that he is no stranger to Valyrian steel.Â  At this point during the show will anyone remember Bran and the dagger, or even care?Â  Even in the books, I bet most people were completely unconcerned about the dagger by this stage, since it makes absolutely no difference to the plot.
It seems to me that the whole dagger plotline in AGOT is one of the weakest parts of ASOIAF (considering how many events rely upon it) and is "concluded" just with a subtle remark by Tyrion.Â  Perhaps the whole thing is better off forgotten.
4676	ambi76	2014-04-09	The Tyrells and Lannnisters are seperately seated at the reception. Pretty sure the Tyrell that cringes when Joff "kills" the book at the breakfast is Mace.
Â 

	Spoiler Loras will not even be there when Joff dies. He runs off disgusted by the dwarf jousting. Mostly the big assed Renly dwarf.

Loras turns up behind Joff as he goes down but doesn't seem to be doing much for the rest of the chapter so I can't really pin it on him.
4678	Harry Lime	2014-04-09	Spoiler What's with all this detective work? Don't we know for a fact from the books that Olenna did it?

Â 
I think everyone's trying to figure out
Â 

	Spoiler  which Tyrell does the actual poisoning. It's been suggested that Willas took the gem from Sansa. We know it's a plot between Lady Olenna and Littlefinger, and that Marg was in on it (because she didn't drink), but the logistics were never confirmed.
4680	iheartseverus	2014-04-09	My guess is that the 'violent, disturbing, disgusting' scene from Ep. 4 that had to be toned down, probably involves the rape of the innkeeper's daughter--I noticed in this past episode distinct mentions of how scary and violent the Mountain is--perfect time to introduce their massive new guy onscreen.
Â 
Even better, someone over at WiC came up with this gem in their discussions of what that scene might be:
Â 
Littlefinger and Lysa having sex?
Â
4681	acosta	2014-04-09	Â 
I reckon so - television license. Â When Ramsay was torturing Theon at the end of season 3, Theon begged him to kill him and Ramsay pointedly said that they still have a use for him. Â I reckon they'll bring the 'Arya' marriage story forward (minus the Jeyne backstory, or at least a shortened version of it if they do it at all - since she'll have to be a northerer of about the same age), and it'll show that Roose's plan all along was to marry the 'last Stark' to his son and make him Lord of Winterfell. Â It's a quicker plan to explain on television.
Â 
It'd make sense to the pace of the show if they just went straight to that instead of doing the Moat Cailin ruse.


Â 
That can't be his plan at this point. Sansa and Tyrion are still expected to produce the next heir to Winterfell. Also, the trailers for the season somewhere show Ramsay telling him that Bran and Rickon are still alive and then suggesting they need to produce "Arya" before the rest of the north finds out and rallies behind a Stark. He probably does that in this episode, since you have to figure that would be one of the first things he'd say when they meet back up.Â
4682	Konradsmith	2014-04-09	iheartseverus, we already saw the Innkeeper's Daughter in Two Swords. Episode four or five could mean Craster's Keep 
	Spoiler  which the leaked call sheet tells us will be in episode four. 
 Or it could be something Ramsay gets up to or mayhaps the Thenns.

4685	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-04-09	I'm not sure what some people are talking about with Ramsay not being as hateable as Joffrey? In the books I probably despised Ramsay more than I did Joffrey.

I'm sure it's gonna change though, probably they are already setting the stage in this episode.

Game of Thrones, Showcase, 3.30pm and 7.35pm
There is no doubt boy-king Joffrey (Jack Gleeson) is a vile, sadistic, murderous little psychopath. But for sheer, nightmare-inducing depravity, there is no matching Ramsay Snow (Iwan Rheon). Last season, we saw Ramsay flaying bits of Theon Greyjoy (Alfie Allen) before finally slicing off his most prized appendage. Tonight, he does even worse to a complete innocent. Ramsay does the things he does not for any personal or political reason, but just for the love of torture. And this is chillingly evident in the way Rheon plays him: composed, in control, utterly unreachable, but with eyes full of delight where you might expect to see nothing. Most of tonight's action, however, takes place down in King's Landing, where Joffrey is finally to be wed to Margaery (Natalie Dormer). Joffrey being Joffrey, he has arranged certain entertainment specifically to humiliate his uncle Tyrion (the marvellous Peter Dinklage) and to twist the knife in Sansa (Sophie Turner). Another brilliant episode.

So they'll change that. It's unfortunate â<U+0080><U+0093> Jaime's monologues would have been perfect for the show â<U+0080><U+0093> but understandable. The show can function even if the details don't all remain exactly as they were in the books.

Â 
I think people (myself included, at times) get to caught up in this idea. Yea, it's gonna be a little different because the premise is different (Payne couldn't talk), but I would rather see him spar with Bronn to be honest. It'll make for great television, and could actually be an improvement, we don't know yet.Â 
Â 
I get your sentiment though.Â 
Â 
edit - and he's probably not gonna spill his guts about him and Cersei but that's not the end of the world.Â

4701	bobbybuilderton	2014-04-09	Payne being mute isn't all that important. Especially since Bronn is established as being the quintessential sellsword. Loyalty as deep as your pockets. It's not a stretch that he'd keep quiet as long as Jaime pays him well enough.

Â 
I count Stannis as my all-time favourite AsoIaF Â character, so maybe I'm a little biased, but in the books (not so much the show at all) he's a really complex and interesting and badass character. He's ultra determined, and will not give up despite any hardships. He's a practical man, and will make-do with whatever he has at his disposal. He's also not elitist. He raises Davos, a mere smuggler, into the position of knight, and then later raises him even further to be Hand of the King, pretty much a big F you to all the other suck-up and useless lords. He also takes Jon's advice, a bastard, whereas not many others would. He's also got a multitude of awesome and badass quotes.
Â 
These pardoned lords would do well to reflect on that. Good men and true will fight for Joffrey, wrongly believing him the true king. A northman might even say the same of Robb Stark. But these lords who flocked to my brother'sÂ banners knew him for a usurper. They turned their backs on their rightful king for no better reason than dreams of power and glory, and I have marked them for what they are. Pardoned them, yes. Forgiven. But not forgotten.
It is not a question of wanting. The throne is mine, as Robert's heir. That is law. After me, it must pass to my daughter, unless SelyseÂ should finally give me a son. I am king. Wants do not enter into it. I have a duty to my daughter. To the realm. Even to Robert. He loved me but little, I know, yet he was my brother. The Lannister womanÂ gave him horns and made a motley fool of him. She may have murdered him as well, as she murdered Jon ArrynÂ andÂ Ned Stark. For such crimes there must be justice. Starting with Cersei and her abominations. But only starting. I mean to scour that court clean. As Robert should have done after the Trident.
I shall bring justice to Westeros. A thing Ser AxellÂ understands as little as he does war. Claw IsleÂ would gain me naught... and it was evil, just as you said. CeltigarÂ must pay the traitor's price himself, in his own person. And when I come into my kingdom, he shall. Every man shall reap what he has sown, from the highest lord to the lowest gutter rat. And some will lose more than the tips off their fingers, I promise you. They have made my kingdom bleed, and I do not forget that.
Lord SeaworthÂ is a man of humble birth, but he reminded me of my duty, when all i could think of was my rights. I had the cart before the horse, Davos said. I was trying to win the throne to save the kingdom, when I should have been trying to save the kingdom to win the throne.
We all know what my brotherÂ would do. Robert would gallop up to the gates of WinterfellÂ alone, break them with his warhammer, and ride through the rubble to slay Roose BoltonÂ with his left hand and the BastardÂ with his right. I am not Robert. But we will march, and we will free Winterfell â<U+0080>¦ or die in the attempt.

I'm really looking forward for Cersei's crazed mother reaction (can she top Catelyn?) and how they tackle Bran's visions.Â 
Â 


Â 
Gods be good. Now that I think of it, I seriously doubt that Cersei's big scene could top Catelyn's rage. And this makes me think the Purple Wedding , as lavish as it promises to be, could be underwhelming. I truly hope not - this is one opportunity to see the Lannisters torn apart.

Â 
Yeah it changes a lot. Many things I think are good and I look forward to it. On one point there could be an issue but I suspect the is a clean way to resolve that.
Â 
People are trying not to spoil in this thread.
4710	bobbybuilderton	2014-04-09	Cersei wouldn't have a big scene. 
	Spoiler She doesn't care about her children, she tells herself that in order to be close to power and have an excuse for doing the things she does to keep it. I doubt we would get anything close to Catelyn's reaction besides blaming Tyrion. Even if you believe she actually cares about her children as much as she claims, she would have problems getting all emotional in front of so many people.

I'm going to be hella sad to see her break down, even it they stage it so it's more "internally cracking apart." Hot damn, I really reaaaaally want them to preserve or slightly enhance that moment when Tywin tells her to let Joffrey go.
Â 
As far as sparring, they probably won't have Jaime spilling his guts as much, but if he's focused more on swordplay, he might inadvertently say more than he means to. Aw hell I just want those handsome dudes sparring. Â

Â 
Great interview. Carice seems really down-to-earth and friendly. I'm really looking forward to seeing the more 'normal' side to Melisandre, that we saw a bit of in her chapter inÂ Dance.Â I also can't wait to see the household dynamic between everyone. That's sure to be a classic scene.
4719	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-09	Some interesting answers:
Â 


What itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s like to work with Stephen Dillane, who plays Stannis?
â<U+0080><U+009C>I really like working with him because heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s so unpredictable and thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s something so stern about him. Liam [Cunningham] explained it really well, actually. He said, â<U+0080>He doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t give a damn about being liked by anyone.â<U+0080><U+0099> And thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s what makes him so cool and so very authentic in a way. Heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a sweetheart, but thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s something about him, you cannot really â<U+0080>getâ<U+0080><U+0099> him. And especially to be in that triangle with Liam and him, that trio is so interesting because those men couldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t be more different, and yet, they get along so well and they make me laugh. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s like Laurel and Hardy. We joke, the three of us, we joke about doing a fun spinoff called â<U+0080>Melissa, Dave, and Stanley.â<U+0080><U+0099> A light-hearted supernatural rom-com.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
Is Melisandre driven by missionary zeal, plain evil, or power-lust?
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>I still believe she has the right intentions: that she really thinks sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s going to save the world with Stannis on the throne. But since we cannot look into the future and sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a very mysterious character, and Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve had several hints of people talking to me about her true intentions, Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m not sure anymore. Thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s why itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s so difficult to talk about it, because I know certain things that I really cannot sayâ<U+0080><U+0093>there may be a big twist!â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
How do you approach the more explicit scenes Melisandre is given?
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s definitely not my favourite thing in the world. But if the scene is great, I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t see the problem. I accept it, because Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve worked with Paul Verhoeven, who I always describe as an intellectual with a dirty mind. And also itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s to show that thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s how the world works. It shows how weak the male flesh is, and how manipulative women can be.

4721	Konradsmith	2014-04-09	Stannis: I would've barbecued sooner...the battle...
Â 
Selyse: I've heard about all your troubles. The lady Melisandre's told me everything.
Â 
Mel: I have.
Â 
Stannis: Well, since my men were barbecued I've not been in the mood for meat burnt black. I've only recently been convinced, Ser Davos reminded me that red meat is more important than a red god...
Â 
Selyse: Mel, is Stan good in the sack? It's been too long. If he's put off by my purported mustache, I would remind him that Maester Martin lied about that.

Stannis: (grinds teeth)

We're all in the same boat about it! Fresher's week in the college is hilarious, he's always running around doing things! He came up to the SciFi stand to sign up for the year when I was on the committee and the look on a fresher's face when she realised who she was standing beside! It's a little sad that he's said when he's finished he wants to give up acting and go into academia, but he's a Trinity Scholar (meaning he is crazy smart at what he's studying) so I think his future is going to be bright whatever he chooses to do!

Tbh, it's probably mostly due to the fact Trinity is such a small campus, physically, you run into everyone! That and the fact the societies are so active, my mate knows him through the rowing club. On the other hand, I'd imagine he likes being in Dublin while all this is going on, nobody really treats him like a celebrity, same goes for nearly any celeb in Ireland. It's considered REALLY bad form if you go up to a celeb and hassle them here.
4726	Chebyshov	2014-04-10	To bring up something else,Â 
Â 

	Spoiler  why are we seeing Stannis this episode? At the end of last season Mel said the true war was up north, so we can assume that's where they're headed. Shouldn't we not see him until the battle? Or are we going to get their journey because I guess the surprise has been ruined? Thoughts?

They don't want the Dragonstone arc to be absent for an entire season, so they're creating a subplot where they go to Braavos and try to enlist the support of the Iron Bank. I'm sure his rescue will still be a surprise, though, in the same way that Tywin's arrival at KL in 'Blackwater' was.
4728	Konradsmith	2014-04-10	^Yeah, the comments are pretty rude there. Still a good interview.
4729	Boggsy Cyvasse	2014-04-10	Found this new video on YouTube- full of interesting character discussions/ new scenes/ behind-the-scenes stuff. I just wanted to put this somewhere where it might get discussed a little more. However, I apologize to the moderators if it seems like I'm spamming this link.

Â 
-A better look inside Mereen.
-Oberyn writing to someone. Cersei approaches... wonder what she has to say? More condescension?
-The actor playing Mace Tyrell doesn't think Mace is the "oaf" everyone seems to think he is.
-Ramsay wants Reek to give he and Myranda some privacy. We get a good look at his "bitches".
-A peek inside Styr's head from the actor playing him.
Â 
Take a look, a good deal of new footage- almost on par with "A Foreshadowing".
4730	Konradsmith	2014-04-10	The Oberyn-Cersei scene is in episode five (as we could read on the scene-starting clapper in the Foreshadowing feature). It's when Cersei says her "what good is power if you..." speech from the second trailer. Other than that most of the footage is very pertinent to this thread because if it didn't in "Two Swords", it will likely show up this Sunday.
Â 
The Oberyn-Varys scene I think will be in episode six.

You're right, I can't believe the majority of comments are about how she's a bad actress and good for nothing but nude scenes. There was even a comment about how her Valyrian is crap and nothing compared to Emilia Clarke...some people are so narrow minded. What do they expect, she was speaking Valyrian in a casual conversation, not a dramatic scene like the Dany one.Â  
Â 
I think she's great at playing Mel and definitely one of the best cast decisions.Â

Yea I know the show semi-blew the surprise by mentioning the true war being up north, but I still really hope they keep it a secret. I believe a lot of viewers will have forgotten about it, or didn't really put the pieces together. That scene is so much more impactful when Stannis just comes out of nowhere to save the day.Â
4738	BenBamBoo	2014-04-10	Just watched the promo again and noticed that Jaime was practising his swordplay with Bronn, not Ser Ilyn.
Â 
In the books one of the things I liked about those sparring sessions was it gave Jaime a chance to 'open up' about what he was thinking knowing that Ser Ilyn couldn't repeat what he was saying as he couldn't read and write, something that I think would have come across well in the show to help show the conflict in Jaime's relationship with his various family members, as well as showing the shift in his character personality at this stage in his arc. I'm wondering if they are just finding a use for Bronn's character or if Bronn is going to continue his bromance with Jamie instead of Tyrion.

"Christie: Yeah, those two -- it sort of made their minds explode a bit. Neither of them could really handle it; they're both staring at the floor. In that scene where Brienne says goodbye to Jaime, he can't even look at her. There's something thrillingly teenage about the whole thing, isn't there?

This is what I'm basing my hunch on. Plus the show runners knew the audience would love the dynamic between Arya and the Hound so they're going to soak that up for all it's worth.Â

Because her getting on the ship is a much better ending (and a much more substantial scene).Â  It sends her off on a sea voyage to end the season, and then we can pick up with her arrival in episode 1 or 2 of the following season.Â  It's also an ending better-suited to a time jump between seasons.

Now that she has needle, there isn't really a lot for her to accomplish in Westeros anymore.
Â 

	Spoiler I imagine they will milk the relationship between her and the hound a bit to set up his death and the effect that will have on her. Her story is one of abandonment and close encounters, I think they will build a sort of Stockholme syndrome relationship in the upcoming episodes then 'kill' the Hound/leave him mortally wounded, leaving Arya alone again, just as she starts to feel comfortable with Clegane. She has killed in self sefence/panic (stable boy in KL), she has killed in anger (the group they meet after the RW) and now she has killed purposefully (Polliver). With Sandor now gone, she will turn back to Jaqen and Syrio with renewed purpose. I think we will see the voyage to Braavos in this season and an episode where she is looking around Braavos, just so we get to see it a bit more and how different it is. I predict the season ends with her entering the HoBaW.
4751	sati	2014-04-11	About Braavos, I think people are mistaken that Arya will be there by the end of the season. As others have stated, in the trailer you can see Stannis' ship under the Titan of Braavos. I'm betting that's the only time we'll see it this season.Â 


I read somewhere the guy who gets hr to Braavos was cast and will appear in finale.
4752	briantw	2014-04-11	I'm betting it's not.
Doing all the CGI work for one scene is not very economical, plus Arya already has needle, for her to not get to Braavos would be terrible pacing for her character.

It's not like they can't reuse the CGI assets for Braavos next season if they need to.
4753	IlAovatar	2014-04-11	Just watched the promo again and noticed that Jaime was practising his swordplay with Bronn, not Ser Ilyn.
Â 
In the books one of the things I liked about those sparring sessions was it gave Jaime a chance to 'open up' about what he was thinking knowing that Ser Ilyn couldn't repeat what he was saying as he couldn't read and write, something that I think would have come across well in the show to help show the conflict in Jaime's relationship with his various family members, as well as showing the shift in his character personality at this stage in his arc. I'm wondering if they are just finding a use for Bronn's character or if Bronn is going to continue his bromance with Jamie instead of Tyrion.


The guy who plays Ser Ilyn has terminal cancer. It makes sense just to end the character's role in the series now and give Jaime a different sparring partner, rather than find a replacement actor for Ser Ilyn.
4754	Queen of Whores	2014-04-11	So it seems like this episode will have a pretty limited amount of stories. We know we'll get:
King's Landing
Dragonstone
Theon + Ramsay
Bran and co.
Could this be it? I hope so, cause I really like when the episodes have a smaller focus. They tend to be the better ones, in my opinion.
4755	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-04-11	So it seems like this episode will have a pretty limited amount of stories. We know we'll get:

I really hope Dany skips this episode.Â
4756	Queen of Whores	2014-04-11	I really hope Dany skips this episode.Â 

I'm almost certain she will. There was nothing of her in the promo, and we know she'll be heavily involved in episode 3, since it's called 'Breaker of Chains,' and will have Daario vs the Meereen champion and the siege of Meereen, so there really wouldn't be anything for her to do in episode 2 anyway. That's all for the best though. I don't want her detracting time from Stannis and Dragonstone.
4757	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-04-11	I read somewhere the guy who gets hr to Braavos was cast and will appear in finale.

That doesn't necessarily prove anything. In fact, if he's only in the finale I think it would indicate the likelihood that she just gets on the boat in the finale and doesn't make it all the way there in one episode.
4758	sati	2014-04-11	That doesn't necessarily prove anything. In fact, if he's only in the finale I think it would indicate the likelihood that she just gets on the boat in the finale and doesn't make it all the way there in one episode.

That's likely too. In fact It's probably gonna be just like in the book with Arya giving him the coin and that's the last we see of her this season.

I bet you're right. I'm pretty sure they said the wedding would be half the episode so having those other stories spread about the other half would make for some nice pacing.
4760	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-04-11	That's likely too. In fact It's probably gonna be just like in the book with Arya giving him the coin and that's the last we see of her this season.

I was hoping for Braavos this season, but that really is a good place for her narrative to end this season. And it's not like I'm going to complain about additional Arya+the Hound time.
4762	Arkash	2014-04-11	Arya's season could also end up with her on the deck of the ship staring at the Titan growing in the horizon. That'd be nice !
4763	Rhaquentis	2014-04-11	The guy who plays Ser Ilyn has terminal cancer. It makes sense just to end the character's role in the series now and give Jaime a different sparring partner, rather than find a replacement actor for Ser Ilyn.



I think Arya also stopped naming him in her prayer as well, which makes sense :/

A fellow book fan friend of mine was adamant that they must include "Penny" and the dwarf mockery show in the wedding. I said I hadn't seen or heard that any actors had been cast for those parts. She'll be thrilled to hear that they have in fact been cast. Does anyone know if there's a link to any info on this?
Â 
Like most in this discussion, I am most anticipating the wedding scenes and since they took so long to film and were some of the most detailed sets created per interviews with the designers, I just know it's going to be everything we hoped for and more!
Â 
As for the previous discussion about why the actor for Tommen looks so much older, I think it's as someone else said - he's about the same age as Bran, and Bran's definitely looking the 13 year old puberty growth-spurt gangly stage for sure. Tommen's more refined as a Lannister but definitely has that awkward chubby faced just-hitting-puberty look and I think it's perfect.

4773	iheartseverus	2014-04-11	I was just reading an interview with Carice vanHouten on what's coming up for Mellisandre this Sunday.
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>We start by seeing her doing a certain ritualâ<U+0080><U+0093>I canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t be more specific than thatâ<U+0080><U+0093>and then we get a little peek behind the scenes of Stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099> household. So you see Stannis and his two wivesâ<U+0080><U+0093>basically, me and his own wife Selyseâ<U+0080><U+0093>and you get to enjoy the dynamics between the three of us.â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>Of course itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s very tense, but the funny thing is Selyseâ<U+0080><U+0099>s on my side more than anyone else. She is a believer, a true believer in the Lord of Light, so sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s in awe of the fact that I represent this religion. But also I think there must be some sort of jealousy. So we see a little bit more of that, and we see my relationship to their child who is not, per se, on my teamâ<U+0080><U+0093>which of course is a nuisance for me. Be assured that Melisandre will convince this child that the Lord of Light is not all bad. Sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll make sure of that.â<U+0080><U+009D>

I don't think they've cast "Penny" specifically and it's unclear if they even have the dwarves at the wedding riding pigs or dogs (it could be some other kind of entertainment since there's some animal issues you would need to deal with otherwise).
Â 
I don't think that this part of E2 is necessarily indicative of Penny being included later on. The dwarves are there in this scene to provide the humiliation for Tyrion, which is obviously very important to the sequence of events. As to whether that comes into play down the road, that still remains to be seen.

I don't mind the jump around between everyone episodes myself because that's really the only way to drive such a massive story, but it is nice to see big events get a little more screentime. I think Bran will get the least screentime (four-to-six minutes)Â of them and that Dragonstone and the Dreadfort will have a bit more between them.
Â 
We should remember though that the episode is only like fifty minutes. We found that out when we got the summaries for the first four eps. So half is really twenty-five minutes not half an hour.

I agree. All those "focused" episodes have so far been among the best ep's.
Blackwater is another example. I was glad that the entire ep was in KL.

And the invented Craster funny business actually looks like it will be awesome. Some of us had hoped that the PW would all be in KL but I'm glad it isn't now because that means we get two of my faves, Stan and Roose showing up on Sunday! Also Bran's vision sounds promising, especially because GrrM likely wrote the thing, so it might have book-portents as well as show ones.

So that is about 26 and half minutes both the dreadfort and dragonstone will have significant scenes with ramsays  twisted idea of hunting and Mel's burnings and dinner time with stannis to roose arriving at the dreadfort.

Â 
Oh I do hope that they include Penny.Â  I know I'm in the minority here - but I loved Penny. I thought she was such a sweet and warm character and it was great to read how she and Tyrion seemed to play off of each other.Â  Just when Tyrion was getting a bit over the top, Penny came along to show him that he is not the only dwarf in the world, and in fact, being a dwarf of common birth can lead to much danger and dispare.Â  IMO Penny helped to help bring Tyion down to earth - humanize him more, much the same way that Brienne seemed to humanize Jaime.Â 
Â 
I really do hope that we get to see the fighting dwarfs, and thus Penny, in this next episode.Â
4802	lostinwesteros	2014-04-11	Unfortunately that's what it seems. People have speculated no CH for a bit since there hasn't been any castings or anything.
I know!  Really, really, really sorry we won't have CH. I was looking forward to him last season, then thought surely he would be in this season once they got on the other side of the wall, but nooooo.  It's hard to see some fav book parts go by the wayside.

	Spoiler The problem is that Tyrion has to this point been shown to be absolutely morally perfect and has no dark or flawed behaviour in him. In the books there was a gradual build up to the murders at the end of ASoS, but in the show there has been nothing. We're approaching episode 4x2 and he's still a knight in shining armour. It's very hard to imagine the Tyrion of now murdering Shae in cold blood.

	Spoiler But it was also shown that Tyrion is a proud man who truly believes Shae is his. For her to not only betray his trust during trial but also betray his love and not just with anyone but his father? This kind of anger will not struck anyone as out of the blue, I'd say it's proportional to what she has done especially that the audience will despise her by then - she was more than annoying in the premiere episode and it looks like this will continue in tomorrow's ep.
4814	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-04-12	Spoiler  I agree. I think/hope they will stick with the books and have him kill her. But what are we to make of the stuff we saw in the trailer for episode two? First, we have Varys telling Tyrion that his father doesn't make idol threats. Second, we have Shae slapping Bronn. It seems at least like they're going to try and get her out of there.

Hadn't thought of that, actually: good point. They will likely use this to sew further seeds of discontent between Tyrion and Shae. It's a good way to go.

	Spoiler  I would imagine that will change during his subsequent arrest and trial. I think that rather then having Tyrion become gradually more morally ambiguous, they will try to make it as sympathetic of an act as possible. I'm cool with that tho, show!Tyrion is a good guy and is likely I stay that way until the series ends. I have accepted this, and it helps me sleep at night

Because its not clear what the spoilers policy is here and so some would rather be safe than sorry. It's not in the title and it's not in the OP. People coming to a preview thread probably expect to see spoilers about the episode/preview but not the series as a whole. I asked earlier if it could be made clearer in the thread for the next preview.

4822	Konradsmith	2014-04-12	^Those lists are incomplete but there is some interesting info on them. Also wicnet says that Brian Fortune actually plays Othell Yarwyck rather than Bowen Marsh. Whether or not that means thatÂ we've yet to meet real Bowen or that they've merged him with someone else, we don't know yet.

Â 
It explains why Brian Cogman on Twitter responded to someone stating they saw Brian Fortune in the Bowen Marsh role in E1 by saying "Keep watching...". They clearly still want Fortune to be a familiar background role while either giving Bowen Marsh's role to a brand new more established actor in S5 or his actions to an already existing NW cast member.
4824	King Tommen	2014-04-12	Wait, has it been announced that Kevan and Lancel won't be in this season? If so doesn't that majorly impact future seasons?


Â 
Not really since I don't believe Lancel even appears in ASoS. Kevan plays the role of Tyrion's confidant during the trial in the books but they're going to have Jaime play that role on the show which makes much more sense given their relationship and Jaime's early presence in King's Landing.
Â 
If they want to bring back both of those characters in future seasons when they actually have something of substance to do, then they are free to. King's Landing is loaded to the gills with characters this season, better not to try and cram in 2 more characters who aren't going to really contribute to the plot.
4825	Benjaario Starkharis	2014-04-12	So, no Russians leaking pics from the episodes this season? Last year there was a guy in 4chan posting screenies like a day before the episode aired.

Lancel has a brief appearance in ASoS at Joffrey's wedding. He was with Kevan and was extremely frail. Sansa commends him for his valor at Blackwater and that was it.Â
4828	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2014-04-13	About Braavos, I think people are mistaken that Arya will be there by the end of the season. As others have stated, in the trailer you can see Stannis' ship under the Titan of Braavos. I'm betting that's the only time we'll see it this season. Is it possible Arya sneaks aboard this ship instead?
4829	Queen of Whores	2014-04-13	Is it possible Arya sneaks aboard this ship instead?

Not possible at all. She's in the riverlands and Stannis and co. set off from Dragonstone. I don't see how this would work.

Â Well, to anyone who has read the books, we stick fairly closely to that plotline, and those reversals of fortune really send him down the rabbit hole. Whatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s interesting about this character is how much he changes [this season]. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s remarkable. When Dave and Dan and I met for the first time, they talked about this stuff, and I found it to be so interesting as an actor to go on that journey because he really ends up in a different place than he thought he was going to. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s fueled a bit by anger towards his family, and trying to find his place in the world. You see that some people rely on drunk, funny Tyrion. I think funny and drunk lasts only so long. He sobers up in many ways. And love is in his life [with Shae], and that causes a tremendous amount of damage â<U+0080><U+0094> because heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s vulnerable and he doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t like to be vulnerable.

4836	Ravi Seaworth	2014-04-13	Perhaps, the so called white-washing was used to enhance the contrast. They seem to like to emphasize those transitions. Just think of Jaime. I guess Cersei and Stannis will have a similar development as characters. Not 100% equal to the books, but following the same type of evolution of the character behavior and personality.

4838	Arkash	2014-04-13	I plan on doing a PW video reaction (I watch the show with like 10 Unsullieds).

This season, the two actors I'm really awaiting to shine are Kit Harrington and Peter Dinklage !
Â 
Peter will do an amazing job with his "darker" Tyrion. It's gonna be amazing TV !
Â 
And this is also Jon's biggest season for many many reasons and I totally trust Kit to pull it off ! His performance in "Two Swords" was truly great ! More to come ! Yeah ! =D

4840	King Tommen	2014-04-13	I am just wondering what percentage of unsullied have already been spoiled of Joffrey's death.


Â 
I think many of them assume he's going to die because he's been set up that way. But I don't get the sense that they think it's necessarily happening this soon, especially in the second episode of the season. They will be suitably shocked.
Â 
If you're Unsullied, you're probably assuming (as I did when reading the books for the first time) that when Joffrey dies, it's going to be at the hands of Arya or even Sansa. Or maybe Stannis. The Royal Wedding is a victory lap for him where none of his enemies are in position to do anything to him. That he just chokes on his wine and dies is not really an outcome many people would consider which is why it's shocking.

In the grand scheme of things, with some of the things we witness through the various POVs, he's not even close to one if the worst characters and I am totally cool with the show's interpretation. I think GRRM would write out some of Tyrions darker deeds if he knew how far some ppl take I with their hate.

Â 
There's a difference between a flawed man capable of kindness but also of ambition and cruelty reaching a breaking point that makes him embrace his worst traits and a chivalrous man pure as the driven snow being utterly transformed after he becomes the victim of the evil people he helped and trusted. Tyrion will probably end up 
	Spoiler  killing Shae on the show, but he's been treating her far better than he did in the books and therefore I expect the murder to be even more heatedly defeated than it was by readers "because she had it coming." In the books, Tyrion had character flaws and made mistakes that became weapons used against him in the trial. On the show, the absence of any moral complexity (which I'm sure Dinklage could have played) will make Tyrion's fall something that is done toÂ this poor poor gentleman. The end result will be the same (Tywin and Shae dead) but the character won't. It's as if show Dany banished Jorah because she wants to screw Daario and Jorah is old and in the way, not because she found out Jorah betrayed her - that would be character assassination, like Tyrion's portrayal as a noble man with no foreshadowing of the traits that became dominant in ADWD has been whitewashing, despite leading to the same plot point as the books. Could any show-only viewers imagine Tyrion raping women and talking of hurting Cersei's innocent children because it will hurt her? In the books, all that had been foreshadowed. On the show, I seriously doubt any of that will be included.

Â 
Basically, in the books Tyrion was Walter White, an intelligent man who went down a dark path because he liked it and ultimately ended up trapped by the forces he'd enjoying playing with and thought he'd mastered. On the show, the first three seasons of noble Tyrion have set him up to be the fanboy version of Walter: the awesome witty hero who's done it all for the best reasons, for his family, and is being screwed over by selfish assholes he needs to smack down and teach to respect him.
Â 
On the bright side, tonight should offer plenty of great scenes involving characters who are allowed to have flaws and screw up in entertaining ways as they try to make the best of things. I expect the episode to be as awesome as show Tyrion is boringly perfect, so bring it on!

Who is anyone to dictate what is done for shock value, especially something like that. Why wouldn't she be stabbed in the belly by someone who hates the fact that she is pregnant with the baby of the King who betrayed his family? Would you have preferred if her throat was slit? Or if she was stabbed multiple times in the heart? Not everything done on the show is Â a conspiracy.Â

I'd argue that the fact that they've made her pregnant in the first place was solely for shock value ; the rest is just "natural" consequence.

I don't think anyoneÂ sees him as a villain, really ; just a deeply flawed character who's capable of some pretty f*cked up acts/thoughts.
Also, while I agree that the way he's been treated his entire life explains more or less his behavior, it does not excuse it : a lot of characters are treated like crap without turning into vengeful and hateful wrecks.

I would have preferred if she wasn't there at all because Robb wasn't stupid enough to think Frey wouldn't be insulted by her presence. And did I say everything is a conspiracy? I made one comment about two topics (RW adaptation and Tyrion adaptation) and suddenly I'm up the show's ass and claiming everything has an agenda? It was done for shock value. Her presence there, us seeing her stabbed where she was, them talking about naming the child Eddard immediately before they're murdered? Changing those things/adding them were pretty clearly an attempt to increase the emotional response to the scene--shock value. Your obvious irritation only exists because of your own idiotic assumptions that have no basis in what I actually said. Next time try using this thing sloshing around in your skull (hint: it's called your brain).

Sorry I didn't mean you were saying that everything was a conspiracy, I should have edited that. And I do agree with you, I don't think she should have been there in the first place. But Robb made so many silly calls, that it doesn't surprise me.
4854	Khal-a-bunga	2014-04-13	@ bobbybuildertonÂ 
Â 
And whose to say that he wouldn't have been equally offended at her absence? Sure, that wasn't the case in the books, but this isn't the books. Since we weren't privy to a scene where this is explained, the obvious assumption to make is that Robb was compelled to have his wife - the Queen - present at the wedding. Because, as Walder had established in his first and only scene prior to The Rains of Castamere, he seems to take great offense at nobles who shrug off his wedding invitations. No jumping through hoops to come to this conclusion, it flows pretty naturally from one point to another.Â 
Â 
That said, having Robb & Talisa talk about naming their baby Eddard, was most certainly an emotionally manipulative move. It's one that I have no problem with, though, becauseÂ it worked. Or, at least, it worked for me and a vast number of others. Ad populum argument? Eh', maybe. But I think it's a bit misguided to assume that Talisa was there solely for shock value. Much like Robb's character functions as a subversion of the idea that the son will avenge the father, Talisa's death (and the death of her unborn son) functions in much the same way, but has the added 'benefit' of being an unexpected turn of events even (or especially, in some cases) for people who had read the books.
Â 
Jeyne Westerling is still alive in the books, and I think a lot of people had their theories about how events with her would play out, so I can see Talisa dying being obnoxious to those specific individuals. And I guess I can also see the annoyance of people who felt it was done simply out of shock value, but I'd argue that you might as well be annoyed with the whole scene - even from the novels - if that's the case. The entire scene is shocking, even though it was also somewhat inevitable. The feeling of foreboding wasn't as prevalent as it was in the novels, but the build-up within the episode itself was appropriately unsettling. And it's not like they'd ever made Walder Frey out to be a reasonable man, in the first place.Â 
Â 
More likely is that Talisa died (the way she died being, in my view, more about symbolism than pure shock value) as a result of both the additional unexpected twist her death would have on the book readers, and as a result of the character (including Jeyne) not playing enough of a role to warrant continued inclusion in the story. If you're going to essentially tie off an entire plot thread, it's best to leave as few leftovers as possible, for the sake of story-telling efficiency. The Blackfish, Walder, Roose, and possibly even Edmure have roles to play in other story lines going forward, so it's obvious to me that Talisa/Jeyne did/does not.Â

4859	iheartseverus	2014-04-13	They're reporting at another site, NeoGAF that HBO has tweeted that HBO GO won't start airing the episode until an hour after it airs on tv.Â  Guess they're trying to avoid the bad press they got last week when the site crashed only minutes after the episode started on tv.

4861	The Onion Sleight	2014-04-13	I am just wondering what percentage of unsullied have already been spoiled of Joffrey's death.


Â 
When I'm on YouTube or something, I always get the feeling that it's nearly impossible for the Unsullieds to don't be aware of Joff's death...
I guess, maybe the half (or more?) already know it... and the others at least suspect something great (good or bad) will happen  .

Aaaahh, the waiting Â  Purple Wedding + Dragonstone + Dreadford + Bran & Co -> In ONE episode, perfect!Â  Â

	Spoiler  Joffrey:Â  I know how to handle Valarian steel, I've handled it before.
Â  Then, Tyrion will realize who it was, right then and there.
Â 
This is going to be a wedding from seven hells in a couple hours.Â  WIsh I could be there, off in a corner somewhere, watching it all go to shit.Â  
Â 
ETA:Â  WiCTumblr has Sigur Ros performing Rains of Castamere.Â  I'm guessing that's what we're going to hear at the end of tonight's episode.Â  Cripes, its so...haunting, so mournful, it gave me goosebumps and made me want to hang myself at the same time!Â  PS:Â  I assume they don't speak English?Â  Sounded like it.Â  Gorgeous, just haunting.

4869	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-04-13	Perhaps, the so called white-washing was used to enhance the contrast. They seem to like to emphasize those transitions. Just think of Jaime. I guess Cersei and Stannis will have a similar development as characters. Not 100% equal to the books, but following the same type of evolution of the character behavior and personality.


Yea I am really hoping your right, mostly for Stannis's sake. I always go back to the way thye portrayed Jaime to reassure myself that Stannis won't always be portrayed as some kind of villain. I assume the change will start occuring when he saves the wall later this season.Â

Not everything in his episodes are written by him  if you listen to commentarys for past seasons he says as much.

I think you're way off the mark. She probably says that after Margery and Joffrey are declared man and wife. You can see everyone happy and clapping. Once they go outdoors for the feast they're probably not going back in by the time the episode is over. I guess we'll know soon though.

Because of course GRRM could never write anything that shows Stannis in a negative light.Â

4896	Aldi_AA	2014-04-13	Because of course GRRM could never write anything that shows Stannis in a negative light.Â 

Not what I said I'm just saying don't expect too much just cause grrm wrote it he wrote probably the worst episode last season IMO.
4897	IlAovatar	2014-04-13	I wonder how horrific the death scene will actually be.
Â 
Part of what makes the moment so interesting in the books isn't so much the surprise of Joffrey dying as was the case with Robb, but rather the manner in which he dies. He doesn't just gasp a little then fall down dead. He turns black and tries to claw open his own throat for what seems like quite a prolonged period of time. You're almost made to feel sorry for the poor child and his mother.
4898	Aldi_AA	2014-04-13	Have we been given any reason to think that the Stannis scenes, in particular, aren't being written by him?

No I was just saying. He probably wrote it but it was just worth noting he doesn't write everything.
4899	Jinjonator	2014-04-13	Not what I said I'm just saying don't expect too much just cause grrm wrote it he wrote probably the worst episode last season IMO.


Well the point I was making was that it doesn't make sense to say they're butchering the character if GRRM himself is writing it (unless you're accusing him of butchering his own character??). Now, maybe it's the case that he didn't write any of the Stannis scenes this episode... but so far I haven't seen any reason to believe that that's the case. So the claims of character assassination are, at present, unfounded.

Sansa should have run off already by the time Tyrion is arrested; otherwise they'd have arrested her too. She needs to escape during the chaos while everyone's attention is on Joffrey.

I agree with this. Is there not anyone else that, like me, thinks we're being tricked into thinking the climax of the PW is this episode and that the wedding will be spread out over two episodes?

Â 
Also, I didn't thoroughly read the thread of Gran De Lys answering questions, but if the wedding was 2 episodes long, she surely would have mentioned it, no? The Purple Wedding is tonight.

Thank you for that link, the description for episode 3 reveals that the weeding will finish in episode two. I was just thinking it would give more time to show the aftermath i.e. Sansa's escape, Tyrion's arrest. But I guess that can always happen next episode.
4904	Jinjonator	2014-04-13	Yeah, my first thought was Sansa's escape would probably be at the beginning of the next episode. I imagine this one will end similarly to the book with Tyrion being accused... but I guess we'll see soon enough.
4905	Aldi_AA	2014-04-13	Well the point I was making was that it doesn't make sense to say they're butchering the character if GRRM himself is writing it (unless you're accusing him of butchering his own character??).

I read that stannis scene was bad but seeing it was worse that's was complete butchering he calls him an infidel and burns him for not converting instead of being a traitor I am now almost certain grrm didn't write this shit.
Edit: And this is why I think it was written by D&D  carice van houten had the script for ep 1 and stannis wasn't in that episode http://instagram.com/p/bOs92fCzIN/
