notice anything about balon but im sure it was in spiritâ loved loras storming out in rage at the offensive portrayal of renly squealing as he was repeatedly stabbed in the buttâ was hopeful sansa

symptoms but this was wonderfully bloody and i love how only jaime and cersei run to the kings side â horrified reaction shots during the wedding of everyone else at joffreys outrageous behaviorâ loras storming out wtf looks from mace and olenna margaery looking to see how sansa reacts to the worst stuff even tywin looks unhappyâ only cersei is amused by this parade of offensivenessâ and thus while tyrion is arrested immediately the show has effectively set up what i hoped they would a who shot jr style mystery and cliffhanger over who really did itâ already the reaction from the unsullied is entertaining me as they speculate wildly and even cleverly sometimesâ one show only fan that i saw has already fingered olenna though they did not notice the significance of her fucking with sansas necklaceâ the early leading culprit is actually dontos as his reappearance in the show seemingly makes no sense unless its to set him up for thisâ and of course he smuggles sansa to safety at just the right timeâ my favorite somewhat joking guess so far is that everybody wanted joffrey dead and gave him a slow acting poison that would take days but because so many people were independently trying to poison him he oded and died immediatelyâ sansa dontos oberyn and his suspicious nickname margaery and olenna have all been fingered tyrion being accused of it of course eliminates him in peoples minds as a potential real killer â and now i need a cigarette even though i dont smoke â"

situation growing more and more precarious was well documented and the dialog between selyse and stannis was very goodâ again when stannis is given some breath to grow the writing tends to be very goodâ his decency does tend to leak out and i donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t think itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a coincidence that this episode was written by martin who has a far far far more balanced hand with stannis than ddâ stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099> commitment is as severe as its ever beenâ butâ<U+0080> wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t he supposed to go northâ â stark raving visions branâ<U+0080><U+0099>s dip into the pool of the supernatural complete with visions similar to dany was very well thought out and executedâ â for a quick scene it reminded us all of the scope of this work â a bolton in the snow the strident terror of the new north was played perfectly with the cold calculating and brutal roose bolton holding court over the reptilian locke the psychotic ramsey and the meek reekâ i thought that the show did a great job of encapsulating reekâ<U+0080><U+0099>s demise and how pliable he is now to ramseyâ it also captured perfectly the high tension and shear terror that is the north now without starksâ also that reek told ramsey about the truth of the stark boys â the dwarf and the cripple so buried deep in this episode was the new discovery of jaime and tyrion characters who have not shared a screen since the pilotâ jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s training combined was great but even better was that possibly for the first time in their relationship it was tyrion who had to make jaime feel safe and jaime who had to admit to a physical limitationâ the complexity of that relationship was tremendousâ andâ<U+0080> â i have a theoryâ â i donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t think shae is an accidentâ i think tywin planted shae i think tywin planted shae and paid bronn to bring him to tyrion so that shae could keep tabs on tyrion for tywinâ at first this was only for the time they were in the camp but as time went onâ<U+0080> wellâ<U+0080> if you are going to make a man hand might as well have a tail on himâ this explains shaeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s strange pedigree â this explains her constant complaints gets more info from tyrion and it it explains her reluctance to leaveâ this will also explain her strange rediscovery in a few episodesâ â thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s my theoryâ â purple people eaters â everything about the wedding was tremendous the dialog between the players the development of the murder joffâ<U+0080><U+0099>s insanity brienneâ<U+0080><U+0099>s silent admission that she does love jaime and who can blame her the dwarf warâ â 95 of the wedding was absolutely perfect but the actual murder itself was specialâ joffâ<U+0080><U+0099>s death was about as well done as can be even jaimeâ<U+0080> calling him â<U+0080><U+009C>jofferyâ<U+0080><U+009D> not â<U+0080><U+009C>your graceâ<U+0080><U+009D> at the critical momentâ joffâ<U+0080><U+0099>s death was raw real terrifying horrible and in many ways far worse than robbâ<U+0080><U+0099>s or nedâ<U+0080><U+0099>sâ it captured the terror of his end momentsâ many people have wanted joff dead for so long and in many ways this was as good as they could have hopedâ â what i am on the fence on â my son is deadâ<U+0080> i wonder what is on tv later in the book cerseiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s scream is the defining characteristic of joffâ<U+0080><U+0099>s murderâ her wail her shear anguish over the death of her son is spectacular and sad the fact that the reader can actually feel sorry for the queen of madness was a triumph of writing and of the readerâ<U+0080><U+0099>s ability to empathize even with the horribles of the worldâ â the showâ cersei seemed upsetâ<U+0080> i mean for a second or two her son ded but it was almost as if the director told her â<U+0080><U+009C>look leena babe donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t dwell on itâ<U+0080> i mean you have two other kids miriteâ<U+0080><U+009D> cerseiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s reaction to her sonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s murder was pedestrian sloppy and cheapâ yeah she has the anger down pat but her anguish was stilted quick and briefâ â what iâ didntâ like â remember that time in the book where they tried to kill bran â<U+0080> neither did the showâ so last week i postulated that on eof the best parts of the book was when tyrion finally pieced together that joff ordered bran killedâ in the books itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a big moment because it 1 shows us tyrionâ<U+0080><U+0099>s brilliance 2 gives payoff to the audience for solving a mystery and 3 fulfills a promise to the audience that even longpassed mysteries will be solvedâ hereâ nahâ who needs conectivityu of story and a description of past events by revealing the truths in the presentâ thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s for losersâ who cares about solving problems and answering questions here more boobiesâ â look i am readily and happily withdraw this criticism if joffâ<U+0080><U+0099>s culpability is revealed in short order i donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t want to wait until the end of episode 40 to find out about an attempted murder in episode 2â but if its not and if dd just let that juicy morsel â<U+0080><U+009C>die on the vineâ<U+0080><U+009D> and convince us that cersei ordered it â<U+0080> wellâ<U+0080>â i got one word for that â failâ â overall a classic episode in a long sea of classicsâ great successâ"

"rmholt",2014-04-14,"im not sure why people think the tyrells were scapegoating sansa except purely for jaded cynicismâ look the tyrells like sansa legitimatelyâ straight upâ the qot and margery have had several scenes with sansa and there has been zero hint that they are doublecrossing herâ in fact there is an interview with natalie dormer where she explicitly says the tyrells are not taking advantage of sansaâ i think people are simply to jaded by lannister methodologyâ the tyrells are not the lannistersâ they are a fusion of lannistersstarksâ they are as crafty clever and politically aware as the lannisters but still with a moral center of duty and justice like the starksâ not as good as the starks but wayyyyy less evil than the lannistersâ the thing is the starks were too goodâ they were so good that they were blind to the reality of the world and ultimately that is what defeated themâ the tyrells represent as good as you can realistically be in this world â the tyrells dont want to muhahahah ruleâ they want to rule because they understand that they alone at this point in history have what it takes to actually and justly rule the seven kindgomsâ remember olennas comment last season about squirting the milk back up the udderâ everythings gone to pot and olenna realizes that if the tyrells dont act to restore things they are guilty by complicityâ they recognize the dangerâ they dont want to be in this situationâ they wish none of this had ever happenedjoffery the war the starks the famine etc â when they came to kingslanding they bid their timeâ they studied everyoneâ gears were turningâ they even called sansa in to talk with her because sansa is a wildcardâ it was very important they understood sansas motivation and most importantly is sansa a powerplayer â they realized that no she isnt and they repeatedly tested her on this to be sureâ shes just an innocent daughter of a man that himself was too innocent to recognize the dangerâ they realize sansa is in an extremely dangerous situation and they decide that if they can they will try to help herâ legitimatelyâ but also helping sansa is not their primary purpose for being here and they wont sacrifice their main goal for hernor should theyending jofferys rule and the war are more important than the life of one girl â so first olenna tried to marry sansa off to lorasâ this would have been a winwin situationâ yes the tyrells would gain the keys to the north but sansa would get her fairytale story and would be out of kl and out of the powerplaysâ i dont fault the tyrells for gaining something in this arrangementâ arranged marriages are usually mutually beneficial and the tyrells werent shafting the starks â when that fell through olenna worked sansa into the main plan of killing jofferyâ again not for a scapegoat but for justiceâ olenna explains her motives as shes taking the jewel from sansaâ listen to olenna talkingâ what sort of monster kills a man at a weddingâ notice shes condemming joffery and also implicating herselfâ joffery is a monsterbut so is olenna for what shes about to do and as tyrion says monsters are dangerous â olenna thought the lannister actions were so reprehinsible that the instrument of their destruction needed to pass through stark hands but she isnt scapegoating sansa because shes set up an escape plan for herâ olenna cares about sansa and is getting her out of this place but only after justice is done â notice several thingsâ tyrion is being followedâ so is bronâ the lannisters know about shae sansas handmaiden very likely the tyrells do tooâ but dontos isnt the type the lannisters respect or fearâ they arent watching him and olenna knows thisâ olenna misdirected everyone with the bit about her handmaidens getting a good necklace tell the who you are and tell them who i am â noone suspects anythingâ it just seems like she wanted a nice necklace for the wedding but no doubt they brought back many necklaces for her to chooseand modifyâ then olenna plants a necklace on sansa via dontos with no one noticing and when events transpire dontos apparently stone sober shows up to save sansa â the qot is absolutely brilliant and has escalated the game to a whole new level and at the same time struck a much needed blow for the good guys and escaped blame herself and got sansa out of dodgeâ the only bad thing that happened was that tyrion got blamed which was not her intent but tyrion is probably the best equipped to get out of the situation certainly better equipped than sansa we dont actually know how the tyrells feel about sansa except shed be acceptable to book willas they dont really want to scapegoat her and im sure lf made his plan sound genius for keeping margaery out of suspicion once tyrion married sansa they couldnt get her but they were given a plan that let them think she would be safe enough though a pawn they dont give two shits about tyrion why should they qot is the tyrell matriarch despite her origins  in fact she chose the family she married into sort of like walder frey is the patriarch it was a nice demo of how a seemingly overdone fuss about necklaces in one episode might need a week or more to be made fully clear to the viewer we dont know if bronn was followed took shae off as ordered or what the writers could work it either way by now tv shae is not

"TheWhiteRabbit",2014-04-15,"generally they hope hell get to make some contribution to the fight against the others and die or else defeat the boltons etcâ liking a character and believing hed be the best choice for the throne isnt the same thing as believing hes actually going to winâ if anything for a lot of people it adds to the tragic aura how many jaime fans really expect him to survive the series are you ts i understand where youre coming from im team arya but i dont know if shed make a great queen maybe so since she doesnt want it honestly tyrion would probably be the best i know there has to be some stannis fans out there though that are at least holding on too a little hope that hell be seated upon the throne in end im the same way with jon he looks pretty much next to dead right now but that doesnt keep me from holding out hope that he is going to make it somehow edited by thewhiterabbit 15 april 2014  1209 am"

"KeeperOfOaths",2014-04-16,"i dont believe the love she has for jaime in the books is the same love she has for renly with jaime it is almost like a sibling thing like a brother theyve been through a lot together it is for lack of a better comparison a love between men who fight together like what robert and ned hadbrothers bound by war and hardship the love she has for jaime isnt the same as what she felt for renly i mean if thats your point i guess i see that slightly but still her honor to cat is the main reason she heads out and she feels like she owes jaime as well that wasnt what cersei meant tonight when she asked her and her response didnt indicate that either so its just likely knowing how the show operates that they will try to make that the main motivationâ â omg really it is the complete other way around â what brienne feels for renly is just a young girlâs crush a crush that does not have a strong fundament he treated her with kindness he valued her as a fighter and he was not so prejudiced so that he wonât give her an opportunity to fight just because she was a woman but he didnât care about her and there was no actual connection there brienne fell in love with a fantasy really just because she is also a woman not only a warrior and she does have feelings and nobody has treated her with kindness and respect â what brienne feels for jaime is totally different it is real love born out of respect and admiration and a deep understanding forged out of extreme experiences and a very strong connection jaime is not just a man who treats her with kindness at the end of their relationship and appreciates her as a fighter he is a man who rescued her twice who defended her who actually proved that he does care for her and for her wellbeing who entrusted her with his honour showing that he values her not only as a fighter but also as a woman of honour with whom she shares values even if she is still innocent while he has become a cynic due to his life experiences when he was young he dreamed after allâ of great deeds of courageâ of being a knight in shining armour with heroic adventures and who she actually knows with good parts and bad parts she trusts and she likes â so you may ignore what it is actually happening in the books she remarking how good he looks in the oathkeeper scene she constantly thinking of jaime she dreaming of renlythe man you say she loved so deeply and then renly turning into jaime over and over again she thinking if jaime would comfort her is she gave up her quest and return to him without sansa and actually thinking that this is what men â<U+0080><U+0093>jaime may want a dame in distress to contort she saying his name over and over again when she is injured etc but from this to actually turn it the other way around and say that brienne cares about jaime just like a sister â<U+0080><U+0093>other than cercei j  would care for her brother while her feelings for renly were looove it is a huge difference and not at all backed up by the books â on the contrary the books point to the exact opposite so i am very happy that the show goes into this direction as well"
"jet199",2014-04-16,"thats were marg places it yet when tyrion picks it up  from the camera angle it seems closer to olenna than where it was put down that might be a continuity error or maybe in the pigeon hooha it got moved i notice oddly that before sansa hands the cup to tyrion her left hand passes over the top of the cup then marg handles the cup and we really cant see where her hands are all the time now i dont think sansa dropped the crystal in the cup but its odd just saying â its just the camera angle which makes it look like the cup if in front of olenna the camera is taking a shot on a diagonal from in going from the cup on the corner of joffs table across to the other table where olenna is sitting the perspective in the shot also gives it away the cup is very big in the foreground with olenna small in the background this shows she is a few yards away if the cup had been in front of her on her table it would have appeared smaller on screen maybe someone who is good with that sort of thing can draw a diagram of the cameras line of sight â this isnt a continuity error they have purposely chosen these camera angles to make it look like the cup next to olenna when it wasnt this trick worked really well and they also used distraction to draw away people attention when marg puts the cup down so people miss where she has put it they have put a lot of work into making it seem like the the cup was with olenna on a casual viewing but nowhere near her on closer inspection they want there to be a double meaning i think this is because we are still going to get the qot did it reveal from lf so they need people to think she had the opportunity but there will be a second reveal maybe in the next book that the poisoner was someone else lf could not really know who actually put the poison in the cup as he was not there and there has always been scepticism about olenna putting the poison in the cup as she is too short to reach it and others have more opportunity â so our suspects in order of probability are marg sansa or tyrion or the poison was in the pie but i wont complicate things with that theory â marg has the best access to the cup if it is marg the it is not a good plan because if tyrion had not reacted to joff then marg would have been the only one with access to the cup and you know that cersei wants rid of marg as much as tyrion unless everyone had bought the choking lie then marg wouldve been a dead woman there is also a big risk that joff could have asked marg to take a slip after she had put the poision in but it also works the other way in that once she puts the poison in the cup she knows to stop drinking and doesnt need a secret signal from anyone the tyrells bleating about it being terrible because marg was drinking from the same cup could be to cover the fact she did it if it is marg then it could be revealed in the next book in or around her trial i imagine cersei could be gloating about margs honour being lost and marg throwing back at her oh i forgot to mention i killed your son i win â sansa has motive and opportunity however i think i saw tyrion looking into the cup after sansa gives it to him this would mean if sansa did it then tyrion knows and let it happen this wouldmight be a change from the books but not too big a change because tyrion certainly suspects sansa and his defence is partly hampered by the fact that he thinks she had good reasons for wanting joffrey dead and so wont blame her olenna could have put the jewel into sansas hand after taking it from her necklace there are a few frames where sansa and olenna are talking but their hands are out of view olennas words about coming to highgarden could be hints that sansa has a chance to leave tyrion and the tyrells will help her sansa could work out the jewel is poison on her own however this theory works better if the original target for the poison was tyrion whose death would free sansa to marry again also he is known for his love of wine and sitting right next to sansa but sansa took the opportunity to kill joffrey instead this theory is crackpot as it relies on sansas dodgy memory but if we get her talking about the unkiss on the show then it is a possibility that her memory problems will have a real purpose in the plot sansas pov chapter after the pw is weird she laughs when she is told she has a good heart she knows the gem was used in the murder but not how when it really shouldnt even occur to her she outright accuses dontos of murder why doesnt she just assume the amethyst was loose and fell out it could be this chapter is weird because sansa is rewriting her memories as the chapter progresses â tyrion has motive and it is also possible that olenna gave him the jewel when the hands were hidden tyrion picks up the cup like he knows something is wrong with it and joffrey points to him the problem is that books tyrions pov makes not mention of poisoning joff except maybe once later or taking the poison from olenna however tyrion often plots and schemes silently in his povs in adwd he finds out young griffs id silently we have him educating aegon which we think is him being helpful only to get a he took the bait thought from tyrion after we find out aegon has followed his advice then we get his escape from slavery and although it is clear what is happening he never once thinks about his plan or that they are trying to escape he just does it so there is a very slight chance that tyrion could have poisoned joff one more count against tyrion is that he and lf are the only two characters to have actually confessed to killing joffery in the books"

"The Killer Snark",2014-04-14,"i somewhat generously gave it an eight a solid episode but not especially inspired and to be honest the most anticipated episode after the red wedding turned out to be a bit of a missed opportunity the dreadfort scenes were very good but were narratively rushed and slightly mishandled the relationship between roose and ramsay too much interfering with how things go down in the books the last appearance of shae was a complete disaster and exceeded my worst expectations of how theyd go with her character arc it seems the producers were simply too timid to have things pan out the way they do in the novels for fear of alienating viewers and have decided to whitewash both shae and tyrion in case viewers arent smart enough to realise tywin would be the one to blame if theyd kept things they way they end in asos even for a nonreader viewer the way their relationship ends onscreen should seem like a big buildup to nothing so thats my main annoyance with the episode aside from that there are minor problems caused by having to resolve too many changes to the chronology of the source and the shows treatment of stannis is by now a lost cause lets hope he fares better in development of his character in the north â the wedding was not big enough penny the dwarf made no appearance and there wasnt enough of a buildup to it oberyn and tyrions relationship is furthered in the third novel by this point the rancour between joffrey and tyrion is built up just prior to the wedding feast which makes it apparent joffrey sees his humiliation of his uncle there as a warning and revenge the bleeding at the nose and eyes was a nice touch but there was no throattearing from joffrey and the show made it too obvious who one of his murderers is he chokes to death too quickly too his face has turned black before he finally kicks the bucket in the book â enjoyable stuff but too many shortcuts and fluffed moments i think to satisfy a lot of casual viewers or those familiar with the novels too many changes that dont work though the wedding feast itself is pretty faithful in the main i really think they should have cut out all of the sidestuff in this and set the entire episode at kings landing in order to do as full as possible justice to the source edited by the killer snark 14 april 2014  0214 am"

"Beric175",2014-04-16,"this was a great episode 910 from me if i had a problem it would be the stannis scenes only because they did not add much beyond mentioning the great other and establishing a lovehate relationship between selyse and shireen the actors are wellportraying what theyve been given but judging from what dd have been saying about stannis in the most recent inside the episode video i think the problem with theâ stannis characterization seems to stem largely from the fact that weiss has a less nuanced position regarding stannis than benioff and that is crucially the problem with the characterâ itself hes a divisive character some people think hes a kinslayer for having renly murdered byâ shadow others think hes got the only legal claim when daenerys also has a good birth rightâ i mean people reading the books have disagreed about the character so why wouldnt that potentially be the case with the creators of the show its unfortunate that weiss wants to portray him in a way that is more akin to a religious zealot than anything else whereas banioff seems to understand that melisandre is just a means to an end and some of that comes through with the actors portrayal of the character in this episode to me because he seems disinterested in whatever religious procedure melisandre as going on and he at least says hands off my daughter so yeah the complexity off the show version of the character has to be found elsewhere than in his speeches about claims and thrones i can live with this portrayal of stannis because i believe the intent is to have him turning up at the wall as a hero in the last two episodes be a surprise despite the fact that theyve established this motivation at the end of last season a bit ofâ a shame that the creators are not on the same page about him but then again many of the readers arent at least shirreen and davos are true to their book counterparts i can live with the show version of stannis for the sake of simplification and narrative economy â the rest of the episode was amazingly welldone and kudos to jack gleeson who has been as good as anyone cpould have hoped for in that hateful role and im really liking iwan rheons portrayal of ramsay as well so heres to the psyhcos of westeros may both of them rest in pieces once the storys overâ alfie allen should really get some recognition for his portrayal of reektheon and now that we have the physical torture behind us it will be interesting to see where he goes rom here and roose bolton is also wonderful on the show really all these serial killers of westeros need is to hug their dads  who the fs jon snow made me laugh locke is one of the better inventions for the show methinks brans story is also getting interesting and its nice to see them bringing in material from when we first met the reeds in the books i think most of brans storyline in the books is not that eventful that chronology is strictly required which could be an asset going forward as they are inevitably going to have to do something with bran once they run out of adwd material so yeah why not introduce elements from earlier books later on welldone i also like the consistency of the visions because it shows that they have a clear endgoal and that well get there sooner rather than laterâ â i see where the divide usually comes from regarding lena headeys portrayal of cersei because when martin writes her we get fullon idiotasshole cersei not just deeply condescendingcynical cersei and its refreshing to see lena portray that hatefulness and schadenfreude so well hereâ i dont have a problem how they usually show cersei its just that viewers might hate her for slightly different reasons in the show than in the books but i can live with that that scene with pycelle was hilarious theyre really setting up her disappointment with him so once he gets to be in charge for a while hell gloat and be sufficiently arrogant which is always good tywin and olenna are both awesome as matriarch and patriarch of their families albeit olenna is deliberately telling tywin to enjoy himself of course so as to make him let his guard down for just that second and thenthe kings choking on the floor all the wedding interactions are wonderful oberynellaria are so wonderfully progressive i would not be surprised they end up becoming fan favourites on the show jaimes really in no position to threaten anyone and certainly wouldnt be able to carry out such a threat and its lovely seeing loras having a backbone here too brienne is wonderfully awkward and yay we got bowing on the show natalie diormer is really making margaery much more interesting than she ever was to me in theâ books and i dont have a problem with bronn stepping in for ser illyn because of sadly the actors health preventing him from carrying onâ â and then of course the mighty jack and peter having at it in whats probably the best building tension weve had so far on the show i especially liked how the show managed to get around the animal cruelty charges that a pig and a dog would inevitably have brought with them and made us feel sad for both tyrion and sansa whilst also playing a nice game of follow the cupâ and if one looks closely tywin is eating the pie so for any viewers who might think that its not the wine theres your answer â â now to me at least it feels like every wedding we had so far has its own character and atmosphere so yes i will always stick with my praise for the shows version of the rw because it now makes it a singular event just as this pw is a wonderful sendoff that was too good for a character like joffey to deserve but jack gleeson cetainly deserved nothing less and i already miss him next week is his last scene as a corpse so lets see if he can do anything more to make us hate him â nb sansa finally has some agency because her decision to leave is still her decision and it shows the beginnings of hopefully great things to come"
"Knight of Ashes",2014-04-16,"well i was gonna give it a six but that closeup of theon followed immediately by tyrion eating a sausage deserves a point at the risk of sounding like ramsay they should make that a running gag but seriously last season iirc left off with tyrion and cersei having an almost normal brother and sister conversation where cersei pretty much admitted that it wasnt her but joffrey who had mandon moore try to kill tyrion she gave the impression that she didnt approve of this and the both of them were kind of bonding cause they both felt oppressed by tywin i know the tv versions of cersei and tyrion have both made threats to each other and have felt hostilities but in light of that scene the flow felt off to me when tv cersei became much closer to book cersei when she was at tywins side conspiring against tyrion"
"The Anti-Targ",2014-04-16,"some nitpicks on the episode and rather an annoyance that bronn is jaimes training partner makes jaime even weaker in intelligence cant even figure out his own training options i suppose they are setting things up to somehow have bronn use that information anyway disappointed that i wont get to hear ilyn payne doing his toungeless cackle laugh"
"Beric175",2014-04-16,"the antitarg you wont be hearing nor seeing ser illyn on the show again sadly because the actor has terminal cancer andâ he expected to die already last year but luckily he has not died yet but yeahâ out of respect they will probably not recast him and hence its best to give his role to another character that people already connected with â knight of ashes you seem to be forgetting that in the same scene between tyriona nd cersei last season tyrion mentions how joffrey could have been smart by using poison to kill him so noone would have known it was him who killed tyrion which then now comes back into play because cersei knows that he voiced such a possibility to murder someone efficientlyâ also have you noticed that every time tyrion asks cersei about some hideous deeds the killing of the bastards ser mandon moore trying to kill himâ she always goes silent and neither denies nor confirms anything i like that far more because it leaves some ambiguity for the viewersâ all the viewers have is tyrions assumptions of what happened no actual evidence or facts to back that up and so why not have the audience led in the wrong direction just because tyrion arrives at one conclusion as a result of her silence does not mean that he arrives at the right conclusion"

"yushkevitch",2014-04-17,"i admit im surprised at how well this episode was received here â it felt awkward uneven poorly paced and the wedding itself was far short of the extravagance that was shoved down our throats for how many episodes â first everythings going smoothly through the first few scenes and then  bam  margaery is being escorted to joffreys side the quickest nuptials in history and then a rather underwhelming in terms of spectacle outdoor receptionâ â the tyrionshae scene was awkward varys brief appearances even more so what was the look on his face during the reception a bunch of confrontations added the drama cerseibrienne and jamieloras being notable but not anything special but not much else â unfortunately i have a feeling that the rest of this season will be something like this plenty of soso marginally relevant scenes highlighted with a few epic ones to keep up the interest its still early yes but i predicted this season and next would likely be the low points of the series so maybe a tad biased but i was genuinely hoping and expecting more edited by yushkevitch 17 april 2014  0259 pm"

"Lady cut throat",2014-04-18,"i give the episode an 8 because like another commenter i feel like they should have just kept the whole episode in kings landing and to the wedding at some points it felt really rushed like they were running out of their 60 minutes but there was some great bits joffreys death was obviously brilliantly done kudos to jack gleeson i liked the joffreytyrion scenes it was so uncomfortable watching him get bullied and humiliated that i was on the verge of watching through my fingers and i liked the way oberyn martell shut down the lannisters"

"Rashtibram",2014-04-19,"im really baffled by the fact that this episode seems to have generated such a lukewarm reaction on this site many of the popular criticisms im reading seem to be either utterly unfounded especially when one takes the time to rewatch the episode with them in mind or are the result of extreme and biased book purism i found this to be easily one of the best episodes the show has done to date and not just because we finally got to see joffrey choke and die as of now i consider it to be 7th on my scale of besttoworst got episodes one spot ahead of the wolf and the lion and one behind kissed by fireâ â httpwwwavclubcoandrose203386 â this review pretty much sums up what i loved about the royal wedding the slowly escalating tension the way the murdermystery aspect was played up by martins writing and graves superb direction and the unsettling sense in that final scene â<U+0080><U+0093> so perfectly captured by the cinematography music and acting â<U+0080><U+0093> that the balance of power in the show had just been drastically altered beyond any hope of repair the interactions between the various political figures of kl were all handled excellently as well from loras parting retort to jaime and neither will you to olenna sneakily but noticeably removing a stone from sansas necklace to kill a man at a weddingâ<U+0080>horrid to oberyns open and uncaring hostility towards tywin and cersei in other places the rape and murder of women and children is considered distasteful â considering the explosive nature of the second half of the episode all the supporting arcs really needed to do was avoid major problems and carry the charactersstory along in an acceptable way but imo most of them went well beyond that i think i probably could have done without the opening hunt sequence but it did provide us with an interesting parallel between the two primary psychopaths of the show i believe this is discussed more thoroughly in the article linked above and the later scene at the dreadfort was quite brilliant im interested â<U+0080><U+0093> and a little apprehensive â<U+0080><U+0093> to see where lockes hunt for the stark boys is going art parkinson and natalia tena didnt film anything for this season if im remembering correctly but im also definitely looking forward to seeing ramsay and reek tackle the siege of moat cailin â the scenes on dragonstone were also handled quite well i particularly liked stannis line i hate a good many things but i suffer them all the same i wasnt the only one in my viewing party who was of the opinion that he was talking about the burnings on the beach as well as his dislike for the taste of fish melisandres talk with shireen was one of the highlights of the episode and the transition from her last line about hell to brans pov direwolf experience was sufficiently eerie and intriguing brans visions were also good although honestly i was expecting that scene to be a bigger deal than it was portrayed as on the whole it seemed a little rushed and i dont think they illustrated clearly enough why bran suddenly felt the need to go touch a random tree my unsullied friends were mostly just confused by the time the camera cut to kings landing i do like that theyre playing up the dangers of warging for too long though im hoping well get to see more of that before bloodravens inevitable appearance â aside from all that the prewedding kl scenes were mostly fine if not particularly mindblowing jaimebronn was predictably good and joffreys petulant cruelty during the breakfast sequence was spoton the shae scene was my biggest issue with the episode when i first watched it but upon reconsideration i cant really pinpoint my problem i suppose it felt a little rushed for what must seem to the viewing unsullied like the farewell of a major character and an entire subplot but when you really think about it it was sufficiently built up and will hopefully tie in well with the rest of her material for this season â so overall a fantastic episode a lot better than the premiere and thats saying something while it wasnt quite momentous enough to earn an eight from me i rate according to a very harsh scale compared to other posters here and as such nearly every episode falls somewhere around the fivesixseven mark blackwater and the rains of castamere being the only exceptions i believe â 710 â also my friend returns as one of the tyrell cousins shes the one cersei rescues from grand maester pycelle during the wedding edited by haldir monark 19 april 2014  0742 pm"

"Dustdevil",2014-04-15,"i actually tried making a thread on this topic but it hasnt gone up until now anyways heres my interpretation of each and every vision except for the last one where br says north â crypts of winterfellâ â â the first vision we see is that of a heart tree followed by the trv flying through the crypts of winterfell directly after that we see the image eddard stark sharpening ice and the close shot of his eye in the black cells of the red keep when varys comes to visit him in season 1 you could simply say that this is repetition of brans previous vision in season 1 where he predicts his fathers death but i think it points to the importance of the crypts of winterfell many here on the forums believe that the crypts of winterfell will have some importance in the revealing of jons parentage and that something is hidden in lyannas crypt specifically the fact that eddard is being shown could be hinting towards the fact that he knew something about the crypts and about the secret that he took with him to his grave which is that rlj â the little girl  after that vision we see an image of a girl in robes standing in the woods beyond the wall in the background we hear a voice obviously br saying that bran should look for him beneath the tree as many pointed out from one of the trailers this girl could be one of the cotf and in this case br is hinting to bran as to who will help him find him â snow on the throne and winterâ  after this we see a series of visions all dealing with the coming winter we see the others dead horse from the end of season 2 we see one staring through what looks like a frozen river and we see once again snow on the iron throne there are two ways of interpreting this on the one hand you could simply say that br is trying to show bran the ultimate outcome if he is to fail in his mission to stop the ww on the other hand the fact that they are showing us the same imagery from danys vision at the hotu could point towards a stronger meaning of this scene it could be that this directly points towards jon snows actual parentage just like how the first vision could point to it this vision could mean that snow is of royal heritage it doesnt necessarily mean that he will sit on the it or become king just that he is rhaegars son and therefore the true heir to the it â bran fallingâ  this is one of the visions that i loved the most we see bran falling down the tower with cersei screaming he saw us in the background could this possibly point towards bran regaining his memory of why he fell how would that have any significance for his story if he finds out why or how he fell especially if he is to be the next greenseer â the black dragon over kings landingâ  im just going to flat out say it here i dont think that this is hinting to dany heading to kl and that it is just there to put the show watchers off i think this scene is hinting more to the fact that aegon will take kl since it only shows the shadow of a dragon looming over it in the books we know that dragons in prophecies dont have to literally mean dragons but that they could be refering to targaryens or blackfyres instead the fact that it is only the shadow that we see is also interestingâ it is a black dragon flying over a red city the banner of house blackfyre in short you could say that this visions means a black dragon will come to kl could this possibly hint to the fact that aegon is indeed a blackfyre and that he will take kings landing in twowâ"

"libertine",2014-12-08,"i see many of you think that the dragon over kings landing means aegon will take the city black dragon over red city being the blackfyre colours i have to admit i seriously doubt that we will even have an aegon in the show the producers have stated that tyrion will interact with dany in season 5 which means there wouldnt be much time for him traveling with aegon and jon con down the rhoyne and stuff moreover it would be kinda strange to introduce such a big charakter in the tv show well i get that martin did the same in the books but lets face the truth most of the show watchers wouldnt even know who that particular aegon even was some wouldnt even know rhaegar which would make things even more complicated for the nonreading audienceâ â my prediction is that the dragon in brans vision in fact symbolizes danaerys the story will move forward quickly in season 5 and lots of storylines will merge together or get cut out so the meereenese knot will be solved and dany will be on her way to westeros accompanied by tyrion by the end of the season as for the snow on the iron throne thing i pretty much think it means that jon snow will end up there at some point in the show although i kinda doubt thats whats gonna happen in the books but hey great stuff for an entertaining tv series"
"TimeThief",2014-04-28,"now im doing this completely based off memory so correct me if im wrong but i do remember from a storm of swords that tyrion realized that joffrey was the one who attempted to kill bran way back when he was still in winterfell and in a coma by using his dagger â i believe he realized this sometime around the rehearsal dinner part of the wedding when joffrey is receiving his gifts including tyrions bookâ â im curious as to why dd didnt want to add that into this season seeing as it was a mystery that was never solved in the first season again if i remember correctly because of all the confusion that happened after roberts death â i know it wouldve been a difficult thing to randomly bring back up again but i wanted to hear what other people thought about it"
"King Tyrion I",2014-11-06,"i would have also liked it if that this mystery had been solved and uncovered but i think they dropped it because of lack of time you know the episodes are not that long  roughly about an hour  and i think they wanted to focus on the main event the marriage and joffreys ultimate demise â of course the book readers i also read the books want more details more things from the books but i guess there need to be compromises and cuts edited by king tyrion i 06 november 2014  0252 pm"
"Kikajon",2014-11-08,"not everyone in this forum including me believed that theory i believe that well not have further details in the books thoughi fear this side part of the story will not be taken into further details but if grrm will writemore on it i think the joff theory will be discarded if so it makes sense that even in the show wasnt mentioned"
"Jehane",2014-11-21,"thats the first time i read about this theory  cant remember tyrion connecting joffrey to the murder attempt on bran but its been years since i read storm im currently rereading but havent even finished agot yet so im really curious to know if there really is a sentence like oh now i know  joffrey tried to murder bran bastard in storm and if there is  what possible reason would joffrey have to kill bran the only two people who might want bran dead are cersei and jaime because bran has seen them also i seem to remember that on the show one of them  either cersei or jaime cant remember which  asked the other one if they had become completely stupid by stealing and using that dagger to kill the boy"

"jaimereborn",2014-04-15,"i found briennes reaction to cerseis do you love him to be heavily unnecessary it takes a lot of the mystery out of brienne and jaimes unspoken connection and creates a previously nonexistent romance to root for that was never overly suggested in the books at all what i so liked about jaime  briennes relationship was just how unconventional it was and how little it revolved around ideas like love and sex it seemed to be based more around shared experience admiration and trust i was disappointed that they felt the need to throw a hollywood kind of romance into this dynamic also briennes reaction was completely unbelievable she easily could have denied it"
"SheRa Seastar",2014-04-16,"i think there is a love between jaime and brienne in the books though brienne didnt say yes or no and i think any sort of connection between them has marked brienne as an enemy of cerseis now because cersei is the only one in her mind allowed to have any sort of relationship with jaime i expect cersei to be vile to brienne in the coming episodes instead of just plain mocking"

"KeeperOfOaths",2014-04-17,"â agreed and tbh i thought it wasnt about jaime at all cersei was angry and wanted to put brienne back in the kitchen where all women belong she was losing her power theres a new queen and thats why after going after brienne she rushes to insult pycelle and exercise her power over margaerys by having the food fed to the dogs everything was about her not jaime and not brienne she just happened to be right when she suggested brienne loved jaime but i doubt she put any thought in it â it was not about jaime at the beginning i agree that at the beginning it was as you said cercei being jealous of the frredom brienne had being a knight etc but once brienne said in such a sweet voice that jaime has rescued her more than once it became about jaime too she realized that there is something there that jaime has rescued a woman he was not supposed to rescue and that jaime has not told her about it so she became jealous and suspicios about this connection too jealous not in the sens thst cercei loves jaime so much and she canât live without him but in the sense that cercei wants to be the center of jaimeâs life and resents the idea of any woman taking what she considers to be hers"

"SeventySeven",2014-04-17,"â what bothers me most on the scene is that it shows that briennes amazing arc searching sansa will be much shorter on the series â â brienne isnt even clearly in love with jaime at that point is when he makes good on his promise to save the stark girls sending brienne after sansa and after present brienne with a sword which she sees acordingly as a recognition of her as a fellow warrior that she lowers her guard â even so is just while traveling with podrik and her exsuitor that she starts to notice that she thinks more on jaime than on renly day by day the realization is slow and to be fair is not a full blown out crap i love that man even while lady stoneheart is demanding her to bring jaime â â i know we cant clearly see inner thoughts on a show but

it before one of them die and im sure there will be no wedding for them as much as i like them both very much so i wont join the knitting circle on making booties for their babies â brienne is living again in the lands of platonic love and jaime not only never beded any noncersei woman he also is trying to became a worthy kingsguard in an atempt to regain the kind of happiness and joyfulness he had when he was as naive as brienne and to be the real deal white knight keeping his pants is suposed to be part of the job â a hot love is not going to do any good to him now the dude needs to regain

what youre talking about weve all read the books we all know wishing for actual happy endings is a waste of time that doesnt mean 2 characters cant fall in love even if it ends in tragedyâ â and btw we dont know when brienne started to fall for jaime because she had no pov in asos so your guess is as good as mine theres no evidence in the text that her feelings start to grow after he gives her the quest if anything the way she talks about the way he looked during the bath tub scene and her reaction of blushing and being shy when he gives her oathkeeper indicates he was already growing on her brienne trying to push her feelings away because shes too scared to confront them is probably part of the show as well the difference is that they cant have her slowly realise she does its part of the difference in the mediums were not inside her head â the scene was nice i donât understand all the negative fuss about it â â as regards the unsullied i think this scene works perfectly for them as wellâ they loved j and b in season 3 they probably didnât see them as a romantic pair but they loved them then came the scene in in 401 with are you sure that we are not related and a lot of them asked themselves whether jaime was actually flirting with brienne because of the whole incest stuff then we have this scene where cercei tells brienne that she loves jaime andâ brienne doesnât answer

dont know if the unsullied arent buying it most of my unsullied just enjoy the storylines wherever they go the intention of this scene was to plant a seed concerning how briennes feelings had grown

"Koi No Yokan",2014-04-17,"it begs the question yes brienne and sansa are both in kl but what exactly is brienne supposed to do here yes she could have approached sansa briefly at some point during the wedding but apart from that â brienne has no sway or power in kl she is basically under the protection of jaime at this point the whole point of her convo with jaime last week about sansa was pressuring him to do something bc hes the only one of them in a position to do something brienne has enough experience with court life certainly not to do anything stupid while shes in what may be somewhat hostile territory my takeaway was that she deferred to jaimes judgment she can be annoyed at him for not doing anything but in this instance shes not going to challenge him and spirit sansa away or something â as for brienne loving jaime i never took that scene for brienne to realize wait i do love him and more wait what brienne has no sense of what real love actually is poor girl the only people who seem to have actually showed real love for her are her dad and the guy who taught her how to fight with a sword her notions of loving a man are pure courtly love with a healthy side of he was nice to me so shes infatuated with renly bc she saw him as this shining example of honor and greatness and his handsomeness certainly helped things but he also treated her decently and with respect at least to her face and made her a knight of his own royal guardâ â so now jaime whos completely different than renly and who brienne actually knows on a deep level as a person and not just a symbol of something is somebody she would probably admit freely prior to cerseis accusation that she regards very highly but love it would never occur to her love is the logical thing you feel for people like renly who are perfect and wonderful its not messy and complicated and directed at people who are messy and complicated like jaime brienne has no mature understanding of love if cersei achieved nothing else with her commentary its that brienne now has to face up to her own complicated feelings about jaime feelings that prior to that moment were almost certainly in briennes mind pretty simple and straightforward â â â now that was brilliant writing achieving so much with so little â going back to cb scene i think it is brilliant writing too because it achieves a lot of things with very few lines â 1 it gives us more insight into cerceiâs character it shows her as the insecure frustrated woman that she is and not as the powerful glamorous queen that she wants to appear she is frustrated by her condition as a woman by her inability to chose her destiny freely by her inability to fight her enemies with a sword in her hand and not only with words and plots brienne represents from a pov everything that cercei wanted to be and to have so being the bitch that she issorry but this is how i see it she takes it on brienne â 2 it gives us more insight into brienneâs character we see her as a shy closed woman not fit for social interaction and less for the kl kind of interaction she is a great warrior but she is a shy woman who is not very capable of fighting with words the way she fights with her sword â 3 it gives us insight into cerceijaime relationship yes she rejected him but this doesnât mean that she is willing to let him escape her influence and power hence the need to bitch out brienne some more â 4 it gives us a little insight into jaimebrienne relationship he didnât tell cercei about rescuing brienne he kept it for himself as something private between him and brienne which is nice â 5 it shows that brienne is very grateful to jaime for rescuing her more than once which is really nice and something i liked a lot because we didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t get to see brienne thanking jaime for saving her on the contrary when they say goodbye in harenhall he tells her that he has a debt with her which bothered me a little because the debt had been paid he rescued her from rape she rescued him from dying after harrenhall brienne is the one who has a debt with jaime i am glad to see her being grateful to him â 6 it plants the seed of something more between brienne and jaime she speaks so fondly of him â two great posts well done"

"SlowLoras",2014-04-17,"lmao at the thirsty jaimebrienne shippers defending that terrible writing i have things that i like as well but im not delusional about them â hm well perhaps if i can offer my two cents as someone ambivalent towards jaimebrienne â i thought the scene worked well for several reasons firstly it illustrates that jaime is cerseis hot button  shes generally quite subtle when it comes to snark slipping in little digs and quips into conversation but when its something shes emotionally invested in  her son for example check out her total lack of subtlety when she puts margaery in her place or jaime she goes for the jugular cerseis no stranger to bluntness nor to rudeness  and her treatment of brienne is both of those things cersei has two reasons to be jealous of brienne â firstly the obvious regard she and jaime have for one another  cersei sees treachery everywhere so even if you were to assume jaime and brienne maintained a purely platonic respect for one another it stands to reason that cersei would see something else shes in an insecure position as queen regent surrounded by tyrells secondly  and this is more evident in the books  cersei constantly bemoans being born female not because she has any real desire to be a man but because she wants to command the same respect and authority as a man heres brienne who seeks the same thing but is a great deal more proactive and in some ways effective at getting it she bows instead of curtseys wears masculine clothing fights better than a lot of men and wears her strength and relative masculinity as a point of pride cersei can be beautiful and queenly and desirable or she can be masculine but to her mind she cannot be both that jaime might even consider as an outside possibility this masculinefeminine hybrid as a potential sexual partner  eschewing jaime in the process  is something cersei just cannot comprehend â but what is cerseis talent picking out a persons weakness and brienne is certainly not comfortable in her own skin at least not to the point where shed consider herself worthy of jaimes attentions or renlys for that matter so cersei zeroes in on this  when she realises her mockery of briennes masculinity has fallen flat she goes for the throat she hears brienne speak almost fondly of jaime and latches on to this id say her you love him was a shot in the dark that hit its target but cerseis cleverer and more intuitive than that brienne is reserved but she also wears her heart on her sleeve  shes honest honourable and her affection for jaime whether platonic or romantic is clear and obvious i dont think its bad writing to have cersei come out and seize on this so bluntly  i think its pretty incharacter for cersei and briennes reaction stunned silence is also in character  im still not convinced brienne hadnt realised it herself but shes pushed those feelings down and suppressed them for so long that shes come to believe that its invisible to others to be sussed out so thoroughly in such a short space of timewell its going to be intensely unnerving especially now briennes left to consider the potential consequences of this piece of information going public â just my thoughts"

"Peter George Stewart",2014-04-18,"i found briennes reaction to cerseis do you love him to be heavily unnecessary it takes a lot of the mystery out of brienne and jaimes unspoken connection and creates a previously nonexistent romance to root for that was never overly suggested in the books at all what i so liked about jaime  briennes relationship was just how unconventional it was and how little it revolved around ideas like love and sex it seemed to be based more around shared experience admiration and trust i was disappointed that they felt the need to throw a hollywood kind of romance into this dynamic also briennes reaction was completely unbelievable she easily could have denied it â huhâ to me briennes reaction was perfect  it was like cersei had perceptively articulated something brienne hadnt yet thought of in such clear terms herself but as soon as it was articulated thats the moment she realized it was true edited by peter george stewart 18 april 2014  0958 pm"

"The Tickler.",2014-04-19,"in the books it was readily apparent that shae was using tyrion because he was a wealthy lannister but in the hbo show i couldnt really tell because either the acting or the writing was off it seems in the show that she really loves tyrion â based on my feelings toward book shae i really hope she never leaves and the plot plays out the way it does in the books i think however that tywin has her killed and the tyrion kills tywin for that reason dd have made every effort to simplify this story for the non book reader audience and considering the books complexity i have trouble faulting them for that its like comparing peaches and carrotsâ â completely agree with this i really dont like shae in the book and her eventual betrayal was not overly surprisingâ â however i dont see the shae of the series betraying tyrion to extent she will have to too match the books"
"Zombies That Were Promised",2014-04-20,"here are my thoughts on shae if anyone cares â i dont see anything at all wrong with the portrayal of shae in episode 1 and 2 â sorry there i said it â shes a scared girl way out of her depth â her only prestige is being tyrions personal mistress and she knows it â i am your whore and when you are tired of fucking me i will be nothing 3x07 â that same scene tyrion gives her a gold chain and says she can buy a ship with it a planted seed of doubt that grows in 3x10 with varys instilling further fear in shaes mind â same scene she offers again 2x10 they go to essos â in her mind its a huge insult to her that offer is flung back at her  but without tyrion in 3x10 â 4x01 she tries to win him back the way they got together â  with sex â its her last power and when he denies her even that no matter what his reasons are not only is she afraid hes sending her away forever but shes afraid that he doesnt even find her attractive it has nothing to do with sansa its more what am i doing wrong baby than any oh no sansa is better than me her whole dialogue that people interpret as jealousy over the sansa marriage in season 3 is her trying to prove to tyrion that he doesnt love sansa why else complain about a fact so obvious to them both she tries to prove that he can fight tywin and cersei â really jealousy over sansa shae was a whore shes used to being tossed around  which is why her lines are not jealousy nor stupidity thats just plain out of character given the tv interpretation â shae is a fighter a lover a protector â â 4x02 she accuses hes afraid of tywin and cersei and he looks away tyrion was a real asshole in that scene shouting youre a whore in her face i dont agree with despising shae that she â shouldve seen through that tyrion was trying to protect her â those things are very hurtful to hear no matter what â imo this still isnt enough for her to willingly betray tyrionâ before 4x01 and 4x02 shed probably let them kill her first but under intense threat and behind closed doors with cersei and tywin and with sansa mia shell more than ease into testifying against tyrion for her own life  the only thing she has at that moment of coercion â itll be awful when tyrion kills her over killing him for breaking up awful â my 2c"

"Mladen",2014-04-14,"actually i dont think the pw was a repaying of the debts of the rw and i dont think the book shows that at all but the tv series implies it heavily through olennas speech to sansa i think thats what cyberias referring to â i was meaning in the narrative sense for the reader not inuniverseâ â â she does precisely not just sit around the actress shows everything she is intensely immersed in every moment transporting so much with a minimum of moves her face a landscape this is the contrary of just sitting around and i am pleased to realize that i so far have underestimated sophie turner â true although i need to see next weeks episode to make definitive statements about sansas storyline in the beginning of season 4 she never speaks too much but she brings out emotions through the gazes oneliners for the first time this was not about just sitting and actually had a point â but i think colonel green has a point when you have actress this talented and who can bring a lot to the table it is frustrating to see her being a piece of furniture especially when the original material gives you space to use it â and as usual we are glad to see you have seen the errors of your ways â â i think this was one of sophies best episodes yetâ despite some of the questionable writing decisions in the past the episode showed sansas strength in ways we havent seen since season 2â loras ran away from the humiliation but sansa faced it with grace and the inner strength shes been developingâ â true contrasting them showed sansas dignity strength and endurance and that is one of those things we missed to see for so long in tv"

"ohpooratlas",2014-04-14,"the general reaction ive seen from unsullied viewers who have generally disliked sansa has been remarkably positive for this episode and i think that is in large part due to sophie turners spectacular acting i loved someones comment from the last page about sophies face being a canvas she conveys so much with only her eyes â i am still a little bummed by the fact that theyve removed sansas agency regarding her active role in her own escape but i do not agree that she has been relegated to furniture her survival in kings landing has been completely determined by her ability to internalize everything to maintain her inner strength and grace â anyway i think we can all agree that from this point on sansa will not be furniture shes going to be sharing a very major subplot in the series from here on out including a location that will predominantly focus on her and littlefinger â regarding margaery i think by the end of joffreys little tirade it became absolute clear that margaery does not have the control over him that she initially thought she keeps doing her best to pull him back but the whole war of the 5 kings debacle just kind of showed her increasing annoyance with him that was joffrey acting in front of everyone in the court imagine how he would have been behind closed doors all it takes for joffrey is one imagined slight â margaery is good but shes not that good shes still learning  as has been demonstrated by the qot in the first episode of this season  and from the glimpse we got in the preview for the next episode"
"Colonel Green",2014-04-14,"anyway i think we can all agree that from this point on sansa will not be furniture that remains to be seen given the writers track recordâ she could just as easily end up as littlefingers prop now that her stint as a prop for tyrion and co is done"

"VladimirDulud",2014-04-14,"i think the first episode of this season is the first that instills some sense of empathy for sansa â she did start out as a cruel spoiled child when audiences first meet her i wouldnt say she was a hit to begin with â because the scene with dontos allows her some grace i do agree that seeing more of her character  kindness gentility  more of her perspectives beliefs etc  would benefitâ â there is something about turners manner and delivery that makes me see her as a bit spoiled and not having learned much in the way of humility even though the character has been through quite a lot episode one this season may have changed that"

"Raksha 2014",2014-04-14,"the general reaction ive seen from unsullied viewers who have generally disliked sansa has been remarkably positive for this episode and i think that is in large part due to sophie turners spectacular acting i loved someones comment from the last page about sophies face being a canvas she conveys so much with only her eyes â i am still a little bummed by the fact that theyve removed sansas agency regarding her active role in her own escape but i do not agree that she has been relegated to furniture her survival in kings landing has been completely determined by her ability to internalize everything to maintain her inner strength and grace â anyway i think we can all agree that from this point on sansa will not be furniture shes going to be sharing a very major subplot in the series from here on out including a location that will predominantly focus on her and littlefinger â regarding margaery i think by the end of joffreys little tirade it became absolute clear that margaery does not have the control over him that she initially thought she keeps doing her best to pull him back but the whole war of the 5 kings debacle just kind of showed her increasing annoyance with him that was joffrey acting in front of everyone in the court imagine how he would have been behind closed doors all it takes for joffrey is one imagined slight â margaery is good but shes not that good shes still learning  as has been demonstrated by the qot in the first episode of this season  and from the glimpse we got in the preview for the next episode â â it would have been marvelous and fairly easy to do to have dontos set up in one conversation with sansa an escape during the wedding so at least she could have been seen to participating in the attempt to gain her freedom â â margaery might have thought at one point that she could control the little monster of a king and initially last season it was shown that she could influence him â but its one thing to influence a teenaged boy whos impressed by a sophisticated older woman and another thing entirely to continue that influence as the teenaged boy grows up into the most powerful man in westeros especially if hes a vicious sociopath who gets sexually aroused by hurting people and animals as in the shows â margaery would have ended up with bruises and welts at the least though joffrey might have abstained from more severe injuries or killing her if she gave him a son or two â i think the queen of thorns who was older and wiser than margaery and knew how a husbands attitude could change over time figured out very quickly that joffrey would have to be killed in order for margaery to remain safe as a nominal baratheon queen"
"Cyberia",2014-04-14,"justice i can see that to a point she does mention when first meeting sansa that she knew her grandfather rickard and that ned had been known for being honorable i think lady oleana was still hoping to get sansa to marry ser loras on the tv show and in the books to willas sansa is the last known living stark and heir to the north they all want her claim in the books and on hbo yes that includes everyone â i dont fault the tyrells for thatâ arranged political marriage usually are mutually beneficial and the starks werent being shaftedâ sansa would get her fairytale marriagelife and be safe â remember shes a girlno matter who she marries the stark line ends with her so far as anyone knowsâ winterfell will pass to another familyâ periodâ no matter what â so what family should get the keys to the northâ the lannisters or the tyrells"

"channamasala",2014-04-14,"totally agree the tyrells are taking an enormous risk and it makes much less sense if we dont see margaery under threat â actually i felt that at the wedding she had some control  she is very good at basic graces like turning situations around distracting people making people feel good she probably would have made a pretty good queen in fact conniving and scheming aside seeing as everyone does that anyway but she was clearly worried about losing it as joffrey acted out she knew when to stay silent and wait for an opening to distract people true but she sure looked worried in some of those scenes â so generally i agree and cerseis fears are quite founded but i do feel like even margaery worried about losing control of joffrey at the wedding itself"

sandor and they become best buddies still no problemâ â theres a joke that every time sean bean is cast its an automatic spoiler that the character hes playing will die since it happens so often i think the moment they cast rory it looked a lot like a spoiler of what wouldnt be happening between sansa and sandor but thats just one opinion it all remains to be seen â peter dinklage and rory mccann were both born in 1969 rory is turning 45 the next week on the 24th peter in june interesting fact  aidan gillen has the same birthday as rory but hes a year older and will be turning 46 next week â im pretty sure everyone on the show is playing down their age with the exception of peter vaughn julian glover and david bradley who are playing older than they are for obvious reasons and the new mountain who is a special case jason momoa may have been the only actor who was exactly his characters age ned is certainly not meant to be 50 in season 1 and catelyn is not meant to be in her late 40s it makes no sense its not like they waited till they were 30 till they got married and had kids in their kind of society tyrion is supposed to be a few years younger than jaime and cersei but peter dinklage is older than both his onscreen siblings the actors playing 17year olds or 16year olds richard madden kit harrington emilia clarke joe dempsie are all in their late 20s it would be ridiculous to expect a 27year old actor to be cast as sandor imagine someone who looks the same age as sansas teenage brothers playing sandor the show has also tried to make people like danyjorah and has even tried to make tyrionsansa more palatable or rootable so to speak which i find mindboggling but i guess its a consequence of dds feelings for tyrion and theyve played with aryagendry too â ive seen that argument before and ive always found it mindboggling i mean really sansa is 11 in the books and 12 at the time of the blackwater battle sandor is supposed to look old enough to pass for aryas father at least how is it less appropriate to play with future romantic possibilities between a 14year old girl played by a 16year old and a probably 30something played by a 43year old man  compared to a 12year old an a 27year old man her age is the problem imagine if they actually had cast a 2627year old guy and an 11year old actress and what that would look like say imagine an ambiguouslyromantic scene between richard madden and the actress who played lizzie on the walking dead can anyone imagine people shipping that if they saw it on screen â its also funny because hollywood is infamous for casting younger actresses 15 years younger on average often more as love interests for older famous male leads its normal for hollywood as long as the woman is of age its the opposite that happens rarely though some brave movies and tv shows have done it the pairing of nick stahl and adrienne barbeau on carnivale for instance though they eventually abandoned that in season 2 in favor of an age appropriate ship tease â i sometimes think that some book fans may have created some unlikely images in their head of what the characters look like with a sandor who looks like a modernday 27year old guy basically the age that richard madden kit harington and joe dempsie are andâ a sansa who looks like shes 1820 though sophie turner actually has turned 18 now and has looked like she could have been 20 since season 2 at least basically something similar to how jack from will and grace described the oc 25yearold teenagers and 35yearold parents â and its also interesting to note that grrm when asked who he saw in the role of sandor when he was writing the books said ron perlman â and yep ive seen lots of sansan shipping by the unsullied during the first two seasons but it seems almost forgotten now simply because the characters are have been in different locations and dont talk about each other edited by annara snow 19 april 2014  0414 am"

"The Kinkslayer",2014-04-14,"i thought i was going to miss pretty pig and the dancing bear but 5 dwarfs as 5 kings was awesome the only thing i didnt like about the jousting was tyrions response to joffrey it lacked the strength of ill fight you because you are the only man in this wedding that im certain of defeating â i think we all can agree that no coldhands and the dragonstone scenes were the weak points of the episode stannis didnt even clench his teeth once â pointless burning of infidels stannis isnt sailing to the wall yet was pretty anticlimatic for stannis whom just won the war of the 5 kings by default show balon is still alive but nobody cares about him also the florents claim to descent from the kings of house gardener so melisandre just wasted some of that valued kings blood edited by the kinkslayer 14 april 2014  0328 am"

"The Killer Snark",2014-04-14,"i have many reservations see my review of the episode most are forgivable but the copout resolution of the tyrionshae arc was an absolute catastrophe and seemed to be patronising nonreading viewers by assuming they wouldnt reach a proper moral conclusion against tywin which keeping the real ending of their situation would have caused to finish things between them this way makes her seem like a superfluous character at kings landing all this time if indeed she managed safely to get on board the ship â the dialogue between jaime and joffers was neat in ep 1 but it doesnt really work that hes already at kings landing in the novels part of what drives cersei further off the deep end is his desire to join the kingsguard and abstain from her bedroom after he returns past the death of jofrey and leaves her with one less person to be close to he would never have cared to protect joffrey anyway and the show made it too obvious who was partly to blame for her sons end â the dreadfort scenes were good but i reckon theon at that point would still have had enough of himself left to slit ramsays throat with that razor after hearing of robbs death even if the episode was written by grr martin he does think to himself he should have died with robb at the red wedding in the fifth novel after all edited by the killer snark 14 april 2014  0409 am"

"Yukle",2014-04-14,"2 cersei her comments to brienne were utterly pointless and unwarranted although her comment about renly does kind of show that shes grasping at straws and getting desparate as she loses power but theres better ways to handle it than that and yes we know theres sexual tension between jaime and brienne it does not need to be stated in such a blunt stupid way â 5 whilst im team stannis i find his scenes utterly bizarre sometimes theyre good where he tells his wife that she will not strike their daughter but generally theyre getting worse and the infidel moment struck me as utterly pointless too and what was with melisandre pulling that daft expression â both of these points are issues i have as well stannis is coming across a petulant child driven only by ambition he is meant to be driven by duty and justice he is not a harsh and cruel person either and doesnt refuse to show discomfort he just tolerates it its known that his marriage is not especially warm but i found his rudeness to his wife extremely out of character he always does his duty so i cannot imagine him being rude to someone his duty says he must treat honourably â the only redeeming moment was stannis immediate defence of shireen there have not been enough scenes with her and stannis it is much needed depth to his character as to watchers of the show stannis seems to be an unfair and almost cruel person â and show dont tell there was absolutely no need to have cersei say you love him to brienne and it ruined the tension by pointing it out worse cersei is the most conceited person in westeros theres no chance whatsoever that she would feel jealous of brienne â sansa is meant to be much more active in her escape than that i was disappointed to see her whisked away with no sneaking off to the godswood and planning with her unknown saviour it has stripped away some of her characters cleverness and left her without much depth â of course though there are great moments in the episode my favourite was the part where joffrey died of course although i did actually think it was well done they reminded everyone why he is despised and ensured that every single person had a definite motive to kill him except cersei and they also put in subtle indications that the lannisters will actually be in a better position following his death â the earlier scenes with ramsay and theon including the bizarre decision to withhold ramsays identity felt like filler now however the scenes feel excellent the conversation between roose and ramsay was a welcome addition to the storyline not present in the books although roose seems indifferent to his son in the books its entirely believable that behind closed doors hed be frustrated by his sociopathic nature the scenes also show the sheer impact of the torture theon has endured to the point where each time you see him i plead with ramsay as i do while reading seriously just kill the poor guy â shae is just in it for the money with tyrion in the books but it seems she is genuinely the spurned lover in the tv series its interesting but possible problematic â spoiler perhaps it is leading to a massive revelation later though jaime is meant to reveal tyrions first marriage was genuine and tywin broke it up and claimed she was a prostitute jaime was complicit in this â perhaps instead it will be revealed that shae is not in love with tyrion but part of a plot to spy on tyrion and the you will not take that whore to court was a move from tywin to ensure that tyrionâ didâ bring her to court maybe jaime will tell tyrion that there must be some motive for tyrion to kill shae and at the moment there doesnt seem to be one â at least thats my theory"

"Thelastactionhero",2014-04-13,"so like many other stannis fans i am quite upset by the rendition we witnessed tonight i realize george r directed the episode but im still curious as to whether or not he wrote the scenes as rumor has it they were meant to be in the premiere rather than in episode 2â â so here are my thoughts and questions and im going to be as objective as i can possibly be given the circumstances i feel that while stannis as a religious pragmatist is ruined and his moral ambivalence is thrown to the wind in regards to the unsullied that there might still be a kernel of hope for the character in the coming episodes this comes from a devoted kings man my reason for believing this comes from stannis scene with his family in which he tells his wife not to strike shireen with the rodâ â now granted as all of us book readers realize stannis burns the florent in the book because he has secret plans to smuggle shireen to the lannisters and because he feels its perhaps the only way for them to reach the wall in time to save the nights watch while alister is sympathetic in the books stannis position is made more morally ambivalent by the circumstances and thus the character suffers heavily from this episodes rendition of the events â â all i can say to fans of the character who are as upset as i am is that while the television series is very different from the book arc there is still the potential for a redemption arc worthy of our captivation its important to note how heavily the show has embellished his love for shireen something that is much more subtle in the books i feel that not only does this foreshadow future developments in winds of winter but that it provides stannis with the groundwork for a redemption arc that is meaningful and potent even if hes been unnecessarily portrayed as villainous hereâ â something to consider as readers of the book is that we dont know the full story yet of who wrote the arc if george did indeed write these scenes its something that fans of the character need to consider in their future readings and yet even still its hard to argue that stannis in sos isnt more fleshed out and sympathetic than hes being portrayed here if george is making a conscious decision to redirect the way hes adapted in the television series fans need to respect that but i dont think that fans of the books have been incorrectly interpreting his arc for no reason we have reasons to sympathize with him as a character particularly in a dance with dragons where jon snow frequently refers to him as the king who still cared â i cant speak to where the show is going to go i dont like where the characters direction is headed all i can say is that we need to respect the show as a different medium and hope that the characters triumphs have the same moral and emotional weight as the failures theyve ascribed to him in this episode this isnt what i was hoping for but its still too early to say stannis has been given the treatment that denethor was given by peter jackson"
"Lord Bronn Stokeworth",2014-04-14,"i think the stannis that martin wants us to see in the books is still in the books regardless of who wrotedirected that scene unfortunately show stannis is already a fanatic who burns men for being infidels it makes more sense for show stannis to simply burning infidels as he usually does than give background on the man never before introduced explaining his treason one that would be hard for him to commit since he is not hand in the show it makes it a bit awkward â i do find it odd that they said it was axel instead of alister i mean hes a fanatic in the book and now cant be introduce i understand that some people take over others roles ie gendry taking over edric storms almostsacrifice role but that just seemed kinda pointless selyse can still have more brothers â and really selyse suffered far more character assassination than stannis this episode she is not a pleasant person but damn do they ratchet up the crazy evil on the show"

"jons nissa",2014-04-14,"my reading of his character in this episode was that he was coerced into the sacrifice by melisandre he takes no pride in nor gives the burning souls much attention whereas his wife and melisandre are positively delighted â this was my interpretation of the scene as well he was clearly not happy about while mel and selyse were very obviously in raptureâ â â i like stannis in the tv show as he has a growing feeling of uncertainty in his actions his beliefs are being questioned but hes too proudstubborn to deviate from his path as its the only one he has â â i like this too and i think this is how the showing is establishing all the hesitation stannis has in the books he is not eager to do any of it and is much more remorseful i think this is definitely creating a similar sense of inner conflict only the books tend to do it before the act and the show does it after"
"Mr Smith",2014-04-14,"i was one of d  ds greatest critics regarding the stannis of last season but i actually didnt have too much to complain about in this episode their biggest mistake is that the burning should have been so that theyd have calm waters in their journey north rather than he was an infidel however the rest of the dragonstone stuff was really good i thought the dinner scene was excellent and i didnt mind the shireen and mel scene much they have time to turn it around"
"hollowcrown",2014-04-14,"i guess theyre building stannis as some kind of creepy villain so we will be even more shocked when he turns up at the wall and saves the day â its very eh though just a problem because for 15 seasons now stannias has been doing nothing but thats what happens in the book and you cant make stuff up"

"Lord Varys",2014-04-15,"ive no issues with the portrayal of stannis in that episode he most certainly allows people close to him ie mel and selyse to burn people for crimes he would not have punished this way before his conversion to rhllor and he must also be aware of the fact that these people would not have given him cause to execute them had he openly converted to rhllorism and allowed melisandre to create her theocracy underbeside his own administration â this is bad especially if book stannis has only chosen a red falcon and does not exactly believe in god if mel is just a powerful sorceress in his eyes then going along with her demands and wishes is actually worse than it would be if he actually believed that her god was real in the books stannis eventually accepts that he is as azor ahai andor that he is supposed to fight the war against the others but we dont really know if he really believes in mels god â show stannis seems to be converted in the sense that he takes mels power and his vision as a sign that mel speaks the truth and that her god is realâ â but one can make a case that this thing should have happened in season 3 directly after the blackwater not now it would have been a much more introduction of shireen and selyse if the florents had tried to sell shireen to the lannisters as tommens bride while stannis was brooding in isolation â the relationship between stannis and selyse seems to be much better in the show than in the books stannis is now disgusted by selyse but that was not always so i guess he could not get along with the woman she became after she dealt with her grief the way she did he really seemed disgusted by the dead children in the jars and i guess he was also not exactly turned out by her flight into religion â his talk with davos in season 2 as well as selyses memory this week strongly suggests that he once cared for her deeply they repeatedly tried to have children and stannis did everything he could to save selyse during the siege of storms end thats much more than book stannis ever did for his wife and tv stannis apparently really loves his daughter we dont know if book stannis really cares all that much for shireen he does nothing to groom her for the succession â it would be interesting if the family story on dragonstone ended with stannis publicly announcing that shireen is his heir the show has made it clear that women come way behind men in the succession to the iron throne so that could be an interesting development especially since selyse hates her daughter in the show it seems that she considers her a rival for stannis affection"

"Thelastactionhero",2014-04-15,"im still catching up on the thread but my impression is that the op title is deceptiveâ its not about a balanced view its not even about show stannis being different from book stannis its about show stannis being different from the kings men view of stannisâ which is nowhere close to book stannis imnsho â theyve created this stannis the mannis great hero image more from reading each others posts and comments than from reading the character as written by grrm the fact that show stannis doesnt follow that mold is simply a function of the fact that dd arent members of their club â as to the issue of stannis fanaticism thats a simple enough issue to deal with later in adwd stannis does become far more fanatically devoted to rhllor he wont let the wildlings through the wall into the gift unless they perform a symbolic act of conversion burning weirwood branches when he burns some men for cannibalism during the snowbound trek to winterfell there is a clear implication that he is doing it as a sacrifice and hoping that rhllor will change his fortunes â so dd are doing something theyve already done many times in the series which is to present things in an order differently than they appear in the books i think the quote goes something like were doing the show in chronological order not bookalogical this is pretty laughable would you mind if i poke a few holes in your logic firstly while there are definitely fans of the character who have a superimposed image that doesnt match up to the text i am not one of them and dismissing the arguments of anyone who views the character as a protagonist on the grounds that stannis the antihero is simply a big conspiracy devised by a club of internet forum nerds is pretty ludicrous â your argument here seems based around the assumption that stannis develops into a fanatic later in the series while this is a poor aesthetic justification for rushing the process in such an uncompelling manner even if it were true i have to strongly disagree with your assessment of his arc in adwd as i mentioned before stannis doesnt try and force the northerners who join his army to convert to rhillor in fact at this point in the story he actually seems to be quite tolerant of their beliefs despite his burning of the cannibals an act which i think functioned as both military execution and religious gesture in equal measure if you remember from the winds of winter sample chapters asha actually urges stannis to execute theon in the traditional northern fashion rather than give him to the flames the fact that he is clearly entertaining this course of action doesnt really seem to indicate a growing sense of fanaticism as you wrongly suggest in fact i think the fall out from that scene is likely to be the deciding moment for stannis youre right to say that his relationship with rhillor is dynamic though and that he isnt a strictly pragmatic atheist but he certainly doesnt burn any innocent people simply for being infidels in the text whatever you think of the character i dont see why we shouldnt be critical of a storyline that is clearly being cheapened by changing the context of events in such a way that present him in an overwhelming negative light rather than one that is dark but morally gray there are plenty of reasons to hate stan the man so please have at it regardless the reason that were all so pumped on martins work is because he has the ability to develop intriguing figures that are morally ambiguous and i think something was clearly lost in translation from book to the television screen i dont expect stannis the ubermensh to appear from the sky killing all his foes with a magic sword but i do expect the cold unyielding morally conflicted figure i found so interesting to appear and he just simply hasnt and now i doubt he ever will â also since were speaking of adwd theres a reason why jon snow calls stannis the king who still cared and its not something readers should overlook jon while being critical of stannis sees the good in him and his cause even if he is sceptical of the lord of light buisness the reason so many of us find stannis compelling is because he grudgingly does the right thing when it counts at the wall and its something that jon comes to understand too as they develop this respect for one another its a primary reason i feel stan is being set up as a tragic hero of sorts rather than as a big bad even this arc is a bit tainted now though because stannis is headed north solely for religious reasons since his adherence to duty has been completely thrown to the wind i mean seriously even if some fans go overboard deifying him its more than clear that stannis in the show lacks a good deal of autonomy i really dont see whats so terrible about criticizing an arc that lacks the poignant nuiance of the books especially when aesthetic changes to narrative such as what we witnessed on sunday night feel unneccessary and do little more than simplify his moral complexity edited by thelastactionhero 15 april 2014  0621 pm"

doesnt match up to the text i am not one of them and dismissing the arguments of anyone who views the character as a protagonist on the grounds that stannis the antihero is simply a big conspiracy devised by a club of internet forum nerds is pretty ludicrous â your argument here seems based around the assumption that stannis develops into a fanatic later in the series while this is a poor aesthetic justification for rushing the process in such an uncompelling manner even if it were true i have to strongly disagree with your assessment of his arc in adwd as i mentioned before stannis doesnt try and force the northerners who join his army to convert to rhillor in fact at this point in the story he actually seems to be quite tolerant of their beliefs despite his burning of the cannibals an act which i think functioned as both military execution and religious gesture in equal measure if you remember from the winds of winter sample chapters asha actually urges stannis to execute theon in the traditional northern fashion rather than give him to the flames the fact that he is clearly entertaining this course of action doesnt really seem to indicate a growing sense of fanaticism as you wrongly suggest in fact i think the fall out from that scene is likely to be the deciding moment for stannis youre right to say that his relationship with rhillor is dynamic though and that he isnt a strictly pragmatic atheist but he certainly doesnt burn any innocent people simply for being infidels in the text whatever you think of the character i dont see why we shouldnt be critical of a storyline that is clearly being cheapened by changing the context of events in such a way that present him in an overwhelming negative light rather than one that is dark but morally gray there are plenty of reasons to hate stan the man so please have at it regardless the reason that were all so pumped on martins work is because he has the ability to develop intriguing figures that are morally ambiguous and i think something was clearly lost in translation from book to the television screen i dont expect stannis the ubermensh to appear from the sky killing all his foes with a magic sword but i do expect the cold unyielding morally conflicted figure i found so interesting to appear and he just simply hasnt and now i doubt he ever will â also since were speaking of adwd theres a reason why jon snow calls stannis the king who still cared and its not something readers should overlook jon while being critical of stannis sees the good in him and his cause even if he is sceptical of the lord of light buisness the reason so many of us find stannis compelling is because he grudgingly does the right thing when it counts at the wall and its something that jon comes to understand too as they develop this respect for one another its a primary reason i feel stan is being set up as a tragic hero of sorts rather than as a big bad even this arc is a bit tainted now though because stannis is headed north solely for religious reasons since his adherence to duty has been completely thrown to the wind i mean seriously even if some fans go overboard deifying him its more than clear that stannis in the show lacks a good deal of autonomy i really dont see whats so terrible about criticizing an arc that lacks the poignant nuiance of the books especially when aesthetic changes to narrative such as what we witnessed on sunday night feel unneccessary and do little more than simplify his moral complexity im sorry if you feel that my logic is laughable but i am in the middle of another reread and am perhaps at the point in the books where stan gets quite a few negative perceptions from various points of view about a fifth of the way through asos  davos is still in the dungeon at dragonstone you can quibble all you want about his motivations but the results of his actions are almost entirely negative review the catelyn chapters in acok and asos she clearly feels that stannis whether his intent was villainous or not has totally shit on the fortunes of houses stark and tully by killing renly renly with the full support of the reach and the stormlands had a very good chance of winning at kings landing stan had none because he alienated the tyrells who had the most powerful army in the seven kingdoms what he did gain at storms end he squandered at blackwaterâ what difference does it make if he burned the florent or which florent for being an infidel or for treason in my opinion it wasnt treason because after losing at bw stannis could no longer consider himself to be king the florent recognized that political reality so burning him was just stan playing sore loser in the worst possible way thats looking at how it goes down in the book a nonking burning someone for treason is not justice its murder how much worse is the show portrayal than that not much imo â there are definitely fans of the character who have a superimposed image that doesnt match up to the text i am not one of them did i say or even imply that you were was my comment directed at any individual in particular no â his burning of the cannibals an act which i think

clearly entertaining this course of action doesnt really seem to indicate a growing sense of fanaticism as you wrongly suggest first off i never mentioned theons impending executionâ which might have been put in spoiler tags its from the wow sample chapter isnt it  ill respond anyway â we have no idea what stans decision in this matter is going to be i dont think the fact that hes entertaining a certain course of action is very compelling evidence one way or another id say that pokes a huge hole in your logicâ â he grudgingly does the right thing when it counts i think this is where the grrm statement he is in spite of everything a righteous man comes into the lightâ the one time that stannis does the right thing prior to his setting out to rescue arya is among the most morally ambiguous moments in his story arc iow while he admits that he must protect the kingdom to become the king its clear to me at least that his goal is still primarily becoming king and protecting the kingdom is now seen by him as his new path to that goal ymmv â i agree with more of what you said underlined in the quotes block than i disagree with especially about portraying the character with nuance and complexity but my initial point was that many people on this forum strip him of that by whitewashing his every deed far worse than anything dd have done in the other direction â as for poking holes in

sections of the book id never even mentionedâ i can admit i was being defensive but seeing as your first point was that this thread has nothing to do with a balanced or at the very least adequate critique of show stannis in comparison to his book counterpart i think i had good reason i am the op after all and i really did intend to facilitate some good discussion here theres a lot of good posts scattered throughout this thread that use textual examples to support why a lot of us are dissatisfied and satisfied with dds interpretation so saying that this is just a place for kings men to whine about how they didnt get to see their nonexistent super hero on the television screen is a bit dickish that being said youve made some interesting points even if i dont buy your reading of the character lets talk alester though now i can freely admit having read davos pov a few times that hes intended to have sympathetic qualities it doesnt really justify him going behind stannis back with peace terms those of which include selling off his only daughter so that he can get brightwater keep back but still alester is far from evil and were meant to feel bad for him when we find out hes gonna get burned to death the reason that context matters here is because burning him for religious reasons rather than a pretty serious treason completely changes stannis ideology burning weirwood trees and not allowing wildings to through the wall unless they swear fealty are not equivalent to burning innocents arbitrarily especially when there is no utilitarian gain to be had this doesnt even synch up with how stannis was portrayed last season yeah he doesnt agonize over gendrys death as much as edric due to the different nature of their relationship but hes still visibly distraught over it its jarring that the man who just a few episodes ago struggled with sacrificing an innocent to save all the boys and girls of westeros from the night that never ends is now burning people for very arbitrary reasons and i really dont think theres a good aesthetic justification for it lets take the main one you offered though which was that stannis becomes a zealot later so theyre just rushing things along well assume for a moment that youre right stannis is going to end up as a villain or at the very least a strong believer in rhillor who is willing to sacrifice innocents willy nilly to appease his new found god he hasnt yet in the text but well go with it the reason i dont find this a very cogent justification is because its along the same lines as saying that tyrion should have been treating shae like shit in season 2 because hes going strangle her to death at the end of season 4 if and when he kills her in tywins bed people are going to be emotionally distraught because of how brightly colored their relationship has been up to this point seeing tyrion take a dark turn is going to have long term effects on those who love him specifically because hes been shown to have so many redeeming qualities throughout the series how we get somewhere is just as important as when which is why changing the context here not only changes the entire direction of stannis arc but it makes him more twodimensional were meant as readers to sympathize with alester but we also understand why stannis executes him the prosperous winds which speak to the utilitarian morality that is intrinsic to the character are another added motivation that makes the act more ambiguous for us as readers by making alester axel in this case completely innocent in conjunction with the use of the word infidel stannis is already colored so dark that even if he does make the full jump to villain it wont be nearly as surprising or compelling now that being said i dont think stannis is being set up to go that way in the books doesnt really make sense to me given the winds of winter chapter sample and jon snows growing enthusiasm for stannis cause i feel like its more likely hes set up for a more tragic heroic end but this is really just speculation on both our ends the fact is though i dont think that stannis arc has been handled with care the last two seasons and whether or not you like him i dont think the show has done a good job at giving the viewer reasons to sympathize with him with the exception of his love for shireen theres no amount of bromancing with davos thats going to wash away this horrendous scene of pointless brutality and i find it suspect that theyll even give him his due at the wall based on their assessment of him but i am open to the possibility that hes being portrayed as darker and more villainous here to make it more shocking when he comes through and starts doing the right thing when it comes to the whole renlycatelyn arc you mentioned theres no question that the results of the baratheon feud didnt bode well for the starks or many people for that matter but saying that things would have worked out had he supported renly is as true as saying that things would have been totally fine if renly had done his duty by stan the man stannis even laments this in sos remorseful for renlys death and regretful that they never achieved their great victory together one that even robert would be proud of theres no question that stannis heroism in the latter half of the book is where readers started to look at him as more than just a dark brooding hardass assassinating penrose was anything but noble but the reason people were even willing to reassess him as a character is because he didnt senselessly murder innocent people for no reason this is a tough pill to swallow doesnt really have a whole lot of aesthetic justification outside of cheapening and simplifying his arc and im still in the dark here for why people are so surprised at the outrage thats come as a result"

"TheReal_Rebel",2014-04-16,"tyrion has burned thousands alive that was a defensive act by tyrion to prevent the sacking of the city by stanniss men in any case as someone who is not a stannis fan per se but has sympathy for him and am charmed by shireen and his relationship with davos i think some here are overly critical of the show i think stannis as portrayed is a complex man a hard man a brilliant tactician and fearless soldier who will ultimately defeat the boltons freys etc but also as a loving man towards his daughter wife and a good and loyal friend who is unfortunately under the sway of a religious fanatic one who i think who has already betrayed him by not going with him to retake winterfell where i fear the white walkers will first show upremember osha  friends got around the wall by boat i dont think he comes off as negatively as some think but is a rather understandable flawed but brave man who would sacrifice himself to protect the realmoh and im american edited by therealrebel 16 april 2014  0431 am"

pledge yourself to my service and you shall rise again as jon stark the lord of winterfellâ<U+0080><U+009D> asos jon xi â the reason stannis would not accept the wildlings as they are is the same as why no one else in his right mind would  as they are currently they are a threat to the realm lets not forget  they kidnap rape steal murder far more often than in the seven kingdoms they accept kidnaping and rape as a legitimate marriage proposal thier economy is based on raiding last time some faction tried to establish an economy on raiding the wildlings plan was to smash thier way south carve a new kingdom from the north or even further south and trust that the nw and the iron throne or whoever else would do the actual work of defending them from the others if you ever wanted to make a case that the burnings are to establish authority here it is and it is showing stannis as better than mormont and the others because he is actually trying to find a way around all the bad blood and the problems that come with the wildlings but it is not some phase stannis is going through it is not going full mel at the same time as he is using the symbolic burning of mance and some branches to get the wildlings to symbolically abandon thier old ways and accept the kings peace laws and become and integral part of the seven kingdoms stannis is also offering jon a lordship when jon says that he has a problem with his vows holding him back from it mel offers that he converts stannis doesnt care his only conditions are that as long as jon makes a decision to join him all jon has to do is bend the knee swear his sword to stannis and marry val karstark did not half to convert nor did umber or mormont stannis wont force jon to convert he offers him legitimacy assumingly pardon for deserting and winterfell the only thing holding jon back is his religious belief unlike sunglass jon does not start as stannis lord and so refusing is not an act of treasonâ â back to the show  if stannis is burning people with no actual gain that we can see back on dragonstone it is going to mark his burning of mance and the burning of the branches as simplyâ more religious oppression rather than the act of establishing authority that you try to defend here stannis is simply that asshole who burns people becasue mel told him to if the thenns are the ones who join stannis later on great  we have the asshole who burns people joined by cannibals that even funny turmund and the likeable ygritte hate but its ok because stannis doesnt look like he enjoys it if anything that makes it worse he is doing something wrong and he knows it but he is simply a puppet how can anyone follow that edited by nyrhex 16 april 2014  0624 am"

argument to make if majority of the readers and the show makers think of stannis as a villain then maybe this stannis minority should reconsider their opinions about stannis i said that dany chooses to sacrifice mirri at least in part as a form of revenge for the death of her husband and unborn child nice of you to overlook my post and then create a strawman out of it but yeah well go point by point here â perhaps you dont find this use of sacrifice acceptable but you seemed to have been defending it on the the strange grounds that having this woman burned alive in order to get dragons is somehow less morally egregious than using it as a form of punishment id say it functions as both but whatever if i misrepresented your position my bad but in both the case of dany and stannis there are multiple motivations which drive these burnings stannis burns alester for planning to sell his daughter to the lannisters a point you havent really bothered talking about because it conflicts with your oversimplification of this story arc and offering peace terms without his leave thereby gaining back brightstone keep and ending the war but also as the text tells us because the sacrifice will ensure prosperous winds hastening them to the wall to save the nights watch i dont know why its so mind boggling for you that human beings are complex and that they can have more than one reason to follow a certain course of actionâ â and regarding your point that this admiration or at the very least respect for book stannis is confined to a very small vocal minority that conflicts with the vast majority of readers you wouldnt mind showing us all the statistics would you im certain youve compiled all the data and have a strong evidence to support this claim its also very telling that you lumped me and all my stan buddies together into a single entity with no individual thoughts whatsoever ive argued from the beginning here that there are multiple reasons for why stannis burns alester and that while it isnt righteous the book arc is far more compelling and his reasoning is more understandable this change in context does mean a great deal as there isnt even a practical gain to be had from this sacrifice and it paints him as a fanatic without any agency just because you happen to have this disdain for the character based more on your hatred of his fans rather than the character from the actual text from what it seems doesnt really make this rather large deviation from the source material aesthetically justifiable even if you hate stannis theres no doubt that utilitarian ethics are at the core of his character and stripping him of that in favor of religious fanaticism does nothing but cheapen this arc â also since stannis is just some stupid villain in your reading would you mind explaining why george r martin finds his rescue of the wall to be a righteous act you know the action that defines his character and proves that he is in fact a righteous man despite the mistakes hes made along the way he also points out that stannis is one of the few characters to fully understand that the real battle is beyond the wall which is why when you say stannis wasnt going north to the fight the others it falls upon you to explain this quote â stannis pointed north there is where ill find the foe that i was born to fight â â regarding your point about whether or not danys dragons are more useful than stannis and lightbringer i spoke about moral intention and utility when i analyzed their different reasons for sacrifice its quite possible that dany and her dragons not that its working out too great for her at the moment could be the turning point in the battle with the white walkers later on but the fact is she sacrificed a woman who is portrayed equally as sympathetic as alester so she could wake up dragons for the purpose of conquest at least in the case of stannis whatever you think of him as a person alesters death was at least partially motivated by utilitarian motives since those winds are arguably what made the difference in them reachng castle black in time still i think its important to note that burning people alive is never a good thing whether its for sacrifice or for punishment as you seem to be fixated on fans of the character clearly dont like that he burns people but i think that your disdain for his fandom has clouded you from seeing that this lack of nuance has cheapened him as a character and over simplified his story arcâ edited by thelastactionhero 16 april 2014  0204 pm"

melisandres magic kill not create a miracle that will wake a stone dragon and save the world thereby allowing him to finally get the throne stannis agrees to a sacrifice based on the hope that 3 leeches will somehow translate into saving the realm and being crowned he is going on faith hope and desperation and is determined to do much and more in his questâ â then i think you need to reread davos iv v vi in asos â stannis sees a vision with his own eyes of the fist of the first men and is certain that what mel is saying about a battle for the dawn against a cold that never ends is true from that vision he agrees to use the leeches that are already filled with edrics blood because he was sick and was leeched the three leeches ending up seeming to perform as required prove that mels use of kings blood indeed has the power she claimed to have the part about a battle for the dawn stannis is already sure about from his first vision which he would later realise was from north of the wall the doubts stannis has are not that a great evil is coming they are that stannis is the one that needs to lead the fight against it and that mel has the power that she claims to aid him in that exactly because those suspicions stannis still makes mel swear on her life even after proofofconcept with the leeches worked how can mel prove that she can creat life only death can pay for life so how can she prove she can bring something to life without killing something else a sacrifice is never easy or it is no true sacrifice if there is no sacrefice you cant bring something to life thats the whole point stannis knows that there is a great evil coming he has this option that he can test to a limit without losing anything but never realy prove that its 100 guaranteed until its too late

disregard herâ<U+0080><U+009D> â he cant take the chance that she is right and he refuses because to try and prove that it works 100 would potentially risk an innocent there is simply too much on the line here for playing safe â instead of this the show has stannis trying to burn gendry after one king is dead and then even after he knows what sam wrote in the letter about the others coming stannis is still sitting on his hands on dragonstone burning infidels because they refused to tear down thier idols its not even remotely similar to the character in the books who is faced with the classic 1 life versus the world question it doesnt make sense that he knows what he knows and is still on dragonstone it doesntâ make sense that he would burn infidelsâ it doesnt make sense that davos is still alive after stannis burns others for not converting and if anything here is unclear its how people try to defend dds presentation of stannis with these weak defenses that stannis is essentially the same thing no its not the same thing its a lot less gery and the watchers are spoon fed that this guy is the asshole that burns people because the red witch told him to do it he is obsessed with his birthright and will do anything to get it not a fucking word that these actions are aimed at saving the human fucking race from extinction the whole tone of stannis actions is changed from 1 act of evil to save humankind  to a bunch of acts of evil to gain the throne for his own selfish obsession with his birthright and even those actions of evil are fucking retarded when you realise that he is on an island and is not gaining anything from this its not even tywin killing a few at dinner than 10000 on the field evil its just fanatical evil and stannis being the religious fanatic or burning

has no idea what shes talking about hes going on her word alone why wouldnt he hes being made to be the greatest hero of all time who wouldnt respond to that â â he cant take the chance that she is right and he refuses because to try and prove that it works 100 would potentially risk an innocent there is simply too much on the line here for playing safe â i totally agree and believe ive said as much in my earlier posts stannis is desperate and melisandre is promising a huge miracle that will seat him on the throne words and promises leeches and deaths â stannis rounded on him in a cold fury i know his name spare me your reproaches i like this no more than you do but my duty is to the realm my duty     he turned back to melisandre you swear there is no other way swear it on your life for i promise you shall die by inches if you lie he is reluctant but he is ready to do it and thats what ive said my earlier quote says im not clear how so many believe a bit of doubt or even tons and tons of it which was not the case washes away all the ramifications of making a decision like burning someone alive and youve suggested a reread clearly you didnt understand my confusion it says that his reluctance doesnt mean he is cleared and absolved of the choice to kill for gain stannis is indeed facing the classic 1 life versus the world question and how one answers tells what type of person they are stannis is ready to kill the boy because it will bring him a miracle that will save the realm and give him the throne â you are he who must stand against the other the one whose coming was prophesied five thousand years ago the red comet was your herald you are the prince that was promised and if you fail the world fails with you melisandre went to him her red lips parted her ruby throbbing give me this boy she whispered and i will give you your kingdom do you think he believes hes the prince that was promised he doesnt understand any of this just as he doesnt understand how the leeches killed the kings or how renly and pembrose were killed by a shadow all he knows is melisandre is claiming to be able to do these things he is willing to follow her and give her what she wants and doesnt seem to fussed about the fact that he really doesnt understand any of it â and if we look closer at the vision you say stannis saw we realize that it is at melisandres bidding that he looks into the flames and sees what he sees hmmmmm if we look at the scene closely we realize it is melisandres interpretation of this vision that puts the seed of the great battle that needs to be fought vs the squabble for the throne it made me realize why dd make it seem like it is at melisandres suggestion that they go to the wall because it is she is showing stannis this vision and then interpreting it for him â it is the great battle his grace is speaking of said a womans voice rich with the accents of the east melisandre stood at the door in her red silks and shimmering satins holding a covered silver dish in her hands these little wars are no more than a scuffle of children before what is to come the one whose name may not be spoken is marshaling his power davos seaworth a power fell and evil and strong beyond measure soon comes the cold and the night that never ends she placed the silver dish on the painted table unless true men find the courage to fight it men whose hearts are fire stannis stared at the silver dish she has shown it to me lord davos in the flames you saw it sire it was not like stannis baratheon to lie about such a thing with mine own eyes after the battle when i was lost to despair the lady melisandre bid me gaze into the hearthfire the chimney was drawing strongly and bits of ash were rising from the fire i stared at them feeling half a fool but she bid me look deeper and    the ashes were white rising in the updraft yet all at once it seemed as if they were falling snow i thought then the sparks in the air seemed to circle to become a ring of torches and i was looking through the fire down on some high hill in a forest the cinders had become men in black behind the torches and there were shapes moving through the snow for all the heat of the fire i felt a cold so terrible i shivered and when i did the sight was gone the fire but a fire once again but what i saw was real id stake my kingdom on itand have said melisandrethe conviction in the kings voice frightened davos to the core a hill in a forest    shapes in the snow    i dont     it means that the battle is begun said melisandre the sand is running through the glass more quickly now and mans hour on earth is almost done we must act boldly or all hope is lost westeros must unite beneath her one true king the prince that was promised lord of dragonstone and chosen of rhllor â this really doesnt paint stannis as the one making the decisions about anything many consider davos as the morality and conscious of stannis and he is frightened about what hes hearing the fact is stannis is seeing this vision when he is at his lowest and broken of spirit at her bidding sounds like the best time for manipulation and of course as readers we now know that melisandres visions are a mixed bag however stannis doesnt my point is at this stage of the story shes only delivered magical deaths and has explained to stannis that there is a greater battle that must be fought in the snow and cold by the savior of rhollor which is him she is definitely the one calling the shots at this point but that changes when they get to the wall shes still up to her old tricks burning mance but stannis is finally removed from her influence which is very very great â it seems dd are honing in on this scene from the books to explain the relationship between stannis and melisandre on screen and it definitely explains the scene at the end of season 2 when they are staring in the flames and in season 3 when she is the one to confirm what davos says about going to the wallâ â â â after he knows what sam wrote in the letter about the others coming stannis is still sitting on his hands on dragonstone yeah i agree i dont know why theyre sitting around dragonstone at

"Konradsmith",2014-04-17,"from what i read lord varys and ran confirm this if youâ want to spoiler davos brings up the golden company to stannis in the scene where both are talking and stannis is against the idea of using sellswords i think he does convince him about it but then the fact is they need gold in a later scene when davos is reading with shireen again she mentions the iron bank casually or offtopic and a lighbulb dings above his head â the reasonâ theyve not mentioned the wall is to create an ambiguity or uncertainty about how the battle of the wall will end maybe theyll play up the weakness of kl and have team dragonstone reconsider another attack there or something to misdirect us they want his arrival to be more surprising and also to give them something to do before they show up naturally they had to go outside of book canon for material edited by konradsmith 17 april 2014  0122 pm"

"Khal-a-bunga",2014-04-17,"or maybe the iron bank will proposition stannis to attack kings landing would make sense considering tyrion has already mentioned how the iron bank would fund the enemies of the throne should the various loans default maybe the scene with tycho will be framed in such a way that it ends ambiguously and we dont know which path stannis will choose until he shows up at the wall of courseâ"

"Konradsmith",2014-04-16,"well we usually cant know until the dvd commentaries when writers and directors are pretty keen to admit about how scenes shuffle between episodes in both pre and post production the reason people think the stannis scenes were written for the premiere instead is because carice van houten tweeted a picture of theâ premiere script last year after receiving her scripts it could have been a formality or the dragonstone scenes or a portion of them could have been meant for two swords edited by konradsmith 16 april 2014  0208 am"

"BlackStark",2014-04-14,"the recast to a noticeably older actor does alter the manner in which the character is presented â you will have to temper the level of his naivete and highly manipulable nature because the mindset of 7 yo or even a 9 to 10 yo does not translate well to the body of a teenager unless your goal is to make him look mentally challenged â the dynamics of the tommenmargarey relationship is also changedthere was some justification to keep a 17 yo and a 7 yo apart it was an absurd pairing but there is no reason to separate two teenagers especially when the girl is the older party â â whether it ultimately matters we dont know because their idea of who and how tv tommen acts and behaves may be totally different than his book counterpart â same name different character"

even christianity realizes to protect life sometimes one must take lifeâ â you should be sad because joffrey was murdered which is the opposite of justiceâ and the lack of justice in westeros is the real tragedyâ indeed the immediate aftermath of his murder was an accusation and an arrestâ if tyrion is guilty then he may be punished for killing joffreyâ if he is innocent even worse the death of joffrey is costing him his freedom and quite possibly his life â the show almost began with an act of justiceâ eddardâ<U+0080><U+0099>s men found a deserter of the nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s watch which is a capital crimeâ eddard questions the man and finds him guilty of desertionâ in front of witnesses he explains his authority let the accused have his last words and then swings the sword â currently no one knows why joffrey is deadâ it is an act of violence at a time when violence and greed has become commonâ there was no recounting of his crimes no one announcing his or her authority to carry out the sentenceâ instead we are going to see the apparatus of justice used to punish his presumed killer and legitimize his cruelty and reign â worse the poisoner probably ate at the wedding

younger brother and cerseiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s youngest child tommen is going to quickly be crowned kingâ tywin lannister will continue to rule as hand while the boltons continue to rule in the north as a reward for betraying the starksâ the greyjoys continue to hold the rest of the north and the riverlands continue to be devastated by kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s men like polliverâ bran rickon and arya remain as homeless refugees who are fleeing for their lives and now because of joffreyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s death it appears sansa will be joining them â while cheering a welldeserved death is cathartic for the mind it isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t for the people who still have to live in westeros â you are right about most of this however i disagree with many of your conclusions â 1 are you talking about justice or about legality those two are not necessarily the same what is legal may not necessarily be just was ned stark beheading the nw ranger who ran away because he was terrified after having seen the white walkers murder his companions justice ned certainly thought it was but did the man really deserve death i dont think so â is deserting the nw really such a terrible crime that it merits death as opposed to a lot of other crimes including murder and rape which arent deemed as serious and can result in the perpetrator being forced to join the nw an organization that some people join of their own free will i dont think so either even ned stark didnt seem to think so he didnt argue to bran that the man deserved death he argued that death penalty was necessary because a man who deserts the nw would be very dangerous because hes in a desperate situation but hes only in a desperate situation because a deserter gets a death penalty according to the law what ned did was enforce the law not enforce justice â between that death and joffrey being murdered at his wedding id argue that the latter is much closer to justice because joffrey deserved a death sentence much more than the nw ranger did even if the murderer was not motivated by the desire to bring him to justice joffrey was probably murdered because of the kind of person he is and the kind of things he does â 2 if a murder were the opposite of justice are state executions the opposite of justice is statesanctioned murder that much better than individual murder  say a murder one done by someone who wishes to punish the guilty or remove a dangerous person from a position of powercapability to do further harm for instance arya killing polliver the obvious answer is that its better because it maintains law and order while something like a vigilante or revenge kill does the opposite but that again is a matter of law and order not justice the stateits regime and judiciary can also be corrupt murderous and unjust and even if it is not there may be failure of justice  people who are executed or otherwise punished may actually be innocent or the judge may be prejudiced and give them a much harsher sentence than they deserve â to use an asoaifgot example the execution of ned stark was legal inasmuch as one recognizes joffrey as the king but joffrey himself had no idea he may not be legitimate because joffrey was the king and had the authority to order it the executions of neds father and brother at the order of the mad king aerys were definitely legal because he had the authority to order it under the laws of the seven kingdoms and nobody even questioned his legitimacy as the hereditary monarch so does that mean that those were examples of justice while joffreys murder or the murder of the mad king were examples of injustice â when it comes down to it the motivations of joffreys murderer are likely to be very similar to the motivations of the state in executing criminals either justice or  more likely  the practical motive of removing of a dangerous person from the stage and making it impossible for them to do any further harm â 3 good luck with getting legal justice in westeros it should be pretty clear at this point that its extremely unlikely to happen to regarding most of the crimes committed by powerful people which includes pretty much everything done by tywin joffrey roose bolton walder frey etc or people who operate in the state of chaos like the mountain polliver and other people committing horrible crimes in warravaged riverlands most of the time only way to have the perpetrators punished for what theyve done and to make them incapable of doing any more harm is well to murder them illegally since the alternative is to let them get away with it and keep doing the same ill take the murder gladly and be happy about it â 4 the third reason that motivates the legal punishments an attempt to show an example and deter further wrongdoings by other people who may follow the example realizing that you can get away with it also applies in this case even though it may not have been the motivation of joffreys murderer the deaths of aerys ii and joffrey show that you cant get away with being a complete douche and committing crimes left and right just because you are a king and that your absolute power is not enough to protect you the fate of aerys ii was used by tyrion as an example for joffrey and while it didnt help the deaths of aerys ii and joffrey can have the same effect â 5 yes guest right doesnt mean what it used to but in a way that can be seen as an example of karmic justice and a warning you shall reap what you sow if you break the rules and commit a horrible crime consequences will follow and others will use the same against you thats maybe not entirely applicable here since joffrey was not involved in the rw but if we look at joffreys murder as a strike against the lannisters it shows that tywin was dead wrong when he gave his bullshit justification of the rw and the reasons why its supposedly good for the realm â 6â you are right that joffreys death does not change that much in terms of the lannister power structure i would much rather have tywin lannister murdered if i had to choose since he is actually crucial for the lannister power structure and is also responsible for many more crimes than joffrey but thats another matter â you are also right that joffreys death results in a bad consequence of tyrion whos probably innocent getting wrongfully arrested and possibly convictedexecuted â but on the other hand if one is hoping that a power structure built on treachery and murder such as the lannister power will collapse  and i certainly am  then something that severely destabilizes the lannister power structure is a good thing and theres no doubt that joffreys murder and the resulting tensions stemming from the lack of knowledge about the idendity of the murderer including tyrions arrest will do just that â 7 becoming a homeless refugee fleeing for her life is a considerable improvement of circumstances for sansa compared to what she was before ie a powerless captive forcibly married into the family who murdered most of her family sansa herself would most likely agree since shes been dreaming of getting away from the lannisters since her fathers beheading and in the books had actually been planning

"sati",2014-04-16,"are we to cry for roob and cheer when joffrey died wellduh â its not even comparable what freys did and what joffreys killer did"
"Clariana",2014-04-16,"â if it were then the freys would not be expected to uphold it in the first place guest right is considered sacred throughout westeros â â you are right about most of this however i disagree with many of your conclusions â 1 are you talking about justice or about legality those two are not necessarily the same what is legal may not necessarily be just was ned stark beheading the nw ranger who ran away because he was terrified after having seen the white walkers murder his companions justice ned certainly thought it was but did the man really deserve death i dont think so â is deserting the nw really such a terrible crime that it merits death as opposed to a lot of other crimes including murder and rape which arent deemed as serious and can result in the perpetrator being forced to join the nw an organization that some people join of their own free will i dont think so either even ned stark didnt seem to think so he didnt argue to bran that the man deserved death he argued that death penalty was necessary because a man who deserts the nw would be very dangerous because hes in a desperate situation but hes only in a desperate situation because a deserter gets a death penalty according to the law what ned did was enforce the law not enforce justice â between that death and joffrey being murdered at his wedding id argue that the latter is much closer to justice because joffrey deserved a death sentence much more than the nw ranger did even if the murderer was not motivated by the desire to bring him to justice joffrey was probably murdered because of the kind of person he is and the kind of things he does â 2 if a murder were the opposite of justice are state executions the opposite of justice is statesanctioned murder that much better than individual murder  say a murder one done by someone who wishes to punish the guilty or remove a dangerous person from a position of powercapability to do further harm for instance arya killing polliver the obvious answer is that its better because it maintains law and order while something like a vigilante or revenge kill does the opposite but that again is a matter of law and order not justice the stateits regime and judiciary can also be corrupt murderous and unjust and even if it is not there may be failure of justice  people who are executed or otherwise punished may actually be innocent or the judge may be prejudiced and give them a much harsher sentence than they deserve â to use an asoaifgot example the execution of ned stark was legal inasmuch as one recognizes joffrey as the king but joffrey himself had no idea he may not be legitimate because joffrey was the king and had the authority to order it the executions of neds father and brother at the order of the mad king aerys were definitely legal because he had the authority to order it under the laws of the seven kingdoms and nobody even questioned his legitimacy as the hereditary monarch so does that mean that those were examples of justice while joffreys murder or the murder of the mad king were examples of injustice â when it comes down to it the motivations of joffreys murderer are likely to be very similar to the motivations of the state in executing criminals either justice or  more likely  the practical motive of removing of a dangerous person from the stage and making it impossible for them to do any further harm â 3 good luck with getting legal justice in westeros it should be pretty clear at this point that its extremely unlikely to happen to regarding most of the crimes committed by powerful people which includes pretty much everything done by tywin joffrey roose bolton walder frey etc or people who operate in the state of chaos like the mountain polliver and other people committing horrible crimes in warravaged riverlands most of the time only way to have the perpetrators punished for what theyve done and to make them incapable of doing any more harm is well to murder them illegally since the alternative is to let them get away with it and keep doing the same ill take the murder gladly and be happy about it â 4 the third reason that motivates the legal punishments an attempt to show an example and deter further wrongdoings by other people who may follow the example realizing that you can get away with it also applies in this case even though it may not have been the motivation of joffreys murderer the deaths of aerys ii and joffrey show that you cant get away with being a complete douche and committing crimes left and right just because you are a king and that your absolute power is not enough to protect you the fate of aerys ii was used by tyrion as an example for joffrey and while it didnt help the deaths of aerys ii and joffrey can have the same effect â 5 yes guest right doesnt mean what it used to but in a way that can be seen as an example of karmic justice and a warning you shall reap what you sow if you break the rules and commit a horrible crime consequences will follow and others will use the same against you thats maybe not entirely applicable here since joffrey was not involved in the rw but if we look at joffreys murder as a strike against the lannisters it shows that tywin was dead wrong when he gave his bullshit justification of the rw and the reasons why its supposedly good for the realm â 6â you are right that joffreys death does not change that much in terms of the lannister power structure i would much rather have tywin lannister murdered if i had to choose since he is actually crucial for the lannister power structure and is also responsible for many more crimes than joffrey but thats another matter â you are also right that joffreys death results in a bad consequence of tyrion whos probably innocent getting wrongfully arrested and possibly convictedexecuted â but on the other hand if one is hoping that a power structure built on treachery and murder such as the lannister power will collapse  and i certainly am  then something that severely destabilizes the lannister power structure is a good thing and theres no doubt that joffreys murder and the resulting tensions stemming from the lack of knowledge about the idendity of the murderer including tyrions arrest will do just that â 7 becoming a homeless refugee fleeing for her life is a considerable improvement of circumstances for sansa compared to what she was before ie a powerless captive forcibly married into the family who murdered most of her family sansa herself would most likely agree since shes been dreaming of getting away from the lannisters since her fathers beheading and in the books had actually been planning to do so since she had offers which the show had decided to deny her â in shortâ there are actually quite a few reasons to feel happy because of joffreys murder some of them purely practical even though there are also other reasons to feel concerned about it â â very much agree i was going to make the same point about joff and the deserter myselfâ my only very minor quibble is that although joff was not personally responsible for the rw it was done in his name and he did not complain about it furthermore he has benefitted politically and personally new sword from it so to an extent he is also culpable â the difference between justice and legality can be discussed until the cows come home however it is noticeable in almost any epoch and any place that the powerful and welloff are much less liable to feel the full rigours of the law even if they deserve it than the poor and dispossessed sometimes subterfuge rebellion and yeah murder are the only ways in which they can be made to pay â rip joff you wont be missed"

"Beric175",2014-04-18,"its an ugly situation overall â fact 1 joffreys a cowardly petty tyrant who enjoys cruelty and always wants to get his way fact 2 joffreys a scared boy dying in his mothers arms without understanding the why or what of whatâ is happening to him at that moment fact 3 guest right applies to the host as well as the guests see craster â so yeah actually lots of reasons to be conflicted about this me being a strong believer in human dignity i cannotâ enjoy other people engaging in base instincts by celebrating the murder of a child your culture and your engagement with it indicates something about you as an individual and even if on the surface it feels satisfying it should not be because martin is trying to tell you that the best way to deal with tragedy is to take it and get over it like sansa does yet most viewers have this thirst for revenge for past injuries inflictedâ on their favourite characters built up for 3 seasonsâ now the aryatypes i dont think going mad with revenge like arya does is the appropriate response to a hard life if anything it showsâ her psychological weakness as opposed to sansa whoâ has been dealt a rough enough handâ as well getting constantly abused mocked and nearly getting raped and yet she holds it together and keeps her humanity as opposed to arya whos so willing to throw it all away so easily â i will end by saying that im not happy aboutâ joffrey dying as a person because thatâ tyrant was also still a vulnerable human being endowed with human dignity and so i will not be jumping up and down on his grave anytime soon nor will i pretend that it was a great loss for anyone other but cersei to whom my sympathy went at the moment of joffreys death overall it was an ugly individual dying in an ugly way showing us all the ugliness beneath the surface of his demeanour before and as he was dyingâ leading to an even uglier situation going forward whilst showing to us the ugly mentality of some of the viewers thus is the nature of the purple weddingâ â edited by beric175 18 april 2014  1025 am"

"Simon Steele",2014-04-15,"i havent read storm of swords in like ten years so i cant remember if cersei sending away pycelle was in the book it seems familiar but i think this point of view hasnt been discussed much yet in terms of the show but cerseis little flaunting of her authority over the grand maester seems to have be lost in the shock that joffrey is deadwill there be a fallout for her character that she sent away the one guy who might have been able to help joffrey i mean most likely pycelle couldnt have helped but im guessing there is significance in cersei trying to express her authority by removing the only qualified medical expert from the wedding feast â even if this happened in the books it was a wasted point i feel like as cersei never really saw her own inadvertent role in her sons death will the show make a bigger deal of this i think its kind of a great moment of irony and so far people havent seemed to really latch onto this as far as i can tell â i also dont remember if the books have revealed joffs poisoner its been a long time since ive read any of them dance of dragons was years ago now too and i am not implying cersei had anything to do with it i just kind of love that her ridiculous belief that she is smarter than everyone else when she isnt kind of was the last nail in joffreys coffin this idiocy of hers definitely takes off in a feast for crows and dance of dragons getting her imprisonedi just hope the books kind of seize on this nice little tidbit"
"Indigocell",2014-04-16,"i dont recall exactly how it went down in the booksâ i do recall that cersei began to favor qyburn at some point so this is one way of doing it"
"Ice_and_Fire",2014-04-16,"no in the book pycelle is present at the feast when joff dies there is a line about him shouting for help to go back to his chambers to get his potions but the poison was so quick acting no one could have helped i think it was more after joffs death that cersei began to become obviously unhinged she couldnt seem to accept that her precious son could be killed while surrounded by his kingsguard and grand maester â and the poison plot is revealed quite soon after the purple wedding although i think there is still some debate on who physically put the poison in the chalice but we certainly find out who is behind it where the poison was etcâ"
"Jaqen Hghar",2014-04-16,"yep as i remember it there are clear conclusions drawn by at least one pow character about who was responsible for the poisoning even if i dont recall it being officially spoken out so itll be interesting to see how its dealt with in the show"

"cip",2014-04-14,"my friend and i have been thinking about a couple of deviations from the books and how to tie them together â at the end of asos tyrion tells jaime that cersei slept with lancel and osmund kettleblack but there is no kettleblack in the series so maybe they let bronn take over the roles of the kettleblacks lets see â  bronn tells jaime this episode that he sleeps with sir laygoods wife  cersei had qyburn give her medicine in e01 perhaps to abort or avoid a pregnancy this means cersei is already being unfaithful to himâ â  ser osmund is a sell sword questionably sworn into knighthood just as bronn  ser osmund testifies against tyrion in the books having bronn testify against tyrion would be big for cersei â  shae was sent off by tyrion and bronn brings her to a ship bronn does not say shaes shipped sailed away he only says shes gone  but shae will we hope betray tyrion and testify against him being found in tywins bed some time after so bronn either lied or was negligent â so maybe bronn and cersei are already sleeping with each other and cersei had bronn bring shae to her as a bargaining chip against tyrion then both shae and bronn will testify against tyrion bronn will be sworn into the kingsguard and take on the role of the kettleblacks moving forwardâ â the only thing is that cersei doesnt have that much to gain from bedding bronn prior to joffreys death and we dont think he is the type of guy she would go for other than that it would tie up a lot of the little missing things and we know that the writers love the jerome flynn and want to keep the cast smaller so merging the kettleblacks into bronn makes sense from that perspective as bronn and tyrion part ways at the end of the season anyway it would be an even bigger blow to tyrionâ and make for an interesting dynamic with jaime as bronn knows about jaimes lack of swordsmanship with his left hand and trained with him â what do you think"

"Ignorant Bog Woman",2014-04-15,"im not sure about bronn sleeping with cersei but i do suspect that he betrayed tyrion offscreen in episode two why else lie about shae getting away keeping in mind that tywin at the breakfast said he wanted shae brought to him before the wedding i think bronn was caught escorting shae to the ship by cersei andor her soldiers bronn naturally interested in preserving his skin makes a deal to lie to tyrion while shae is put away for questioning later on"
"cip",2014-04-15,"exactly shae coming to the trial will play as a betrayal by bronn either way now maybe he just didnt wait there until the ship sailed away and cerseis agents took shae after he left but this would be a lackluster explanation â so probably he already betrayed tyrion for cersei andor tywin this makes it pretty easy for him to be sleeping with cersei and enter the kingsguard â also given that cersei has been sleeping with another man i dont really count pitiful lancel as sleeping with him wouldnt have caused her to scream everythings changed imo you gotta wonder who it is unless they want to introduce a new character a kettleblack it needs to be some knight in kings landing and i dont see anyone pretty in the kingsguard â bronn is as to his arrogance and skill not that unlike jaime and he hasnt been serving tyrion for some time when tyrion was licking his wounds after blackwater the affair might have started then and there or it might have started after tyrion sent myrcella to dorne with cersei hoping to gain information about tyrion by bedding bronn â lena and jerome having had a fling is interesting in this context"
"Mel_Rose",2014-04-15,"interesting idea i think its likely that the kettleback character might not appear at all and bronn will take his place i had figured that he will follow jaime to the riverlands since he took over parts of paynes role i find that the idea of bronn betraying tyrion actually makes me quite sad  esp in the show they have such a good rapport i am hoping that varys told cersei about shaes leaving and she sent people to the ship"

"Khal-a-bunga",2014-04-13," bobbybuildertonâ â and whose to say that he wouldnt have been equally offended at her absence sure that wasnt the case in the books but this isnt the books since we werent privy to a scene where this is explained the obvious assumption to make is that robb was compelled to have his wife  the queen  present at the wedding because as walder had established in his first and only scene prior to the rains of castamere he seems to take great offense at nobles who shrug off his wedding invitations no jumping through hoops to come to this conclusion it flows pretty naturally from one point to anotherâ â that said having robb  talisa talk about naming their baby eddard was most certainly an emotionally manipulative move its one that i have no problem with though becauseâ it worked or at least it worked for me and a vast number of others ad populum argument eh maybe but i think its a bit misguided to assume that talisa was there solely for shock value much like robbs character functions as a subversion of the idea that the son will avenge the father talisas death and the death of her unborn son functions in much the same way but has the added benefit of being an unexpected turn of events even or especially in some cases for people who had read the books â jeyne westerling is still alive in the books and i think a lot of people had their theories about how events with her would play out so i can see talisa dying being obnoxious to those specific individuals and i guess i can also see the annoyance of people who felt it was done simply out of shock value but id argue that you might as well be annoyed with the whole scene  even from the novels  if thats the case the entire scene is shocking even though it was also somewhat inevitable the feeling of foreboding wasnt as prevalent as it was in the novels but the buildup within the episode itself was appropriately unsettling and its not like theyd ever made walder frey out to be a reasonable man in the first placeâ â more likely is that talisa died the way she died being in my view more about symbolism than pure shock value as a result of both the additional unexpected twist her death would have on the book readers and as a result of the character including jeyne not playing enough of a role to warrant continued inclusion in the story if youre going to essentially tie off an entire plot thread its best to leave as few leftovers as possible for the sake of storytelling efficiency the blackfish walder roose and possibly even edmure have roles to play in other story lines going forward so its obvious to me that talisajeyne diddoes notâ edited by khalabunga 13 april 2014  0316 pm"
