"Ran",2011-06-19,"last episode of the first season whatd you think"
"All-For-HotPie",2011-06-19,"was darn good but i was a little upset about the placement of the green dragon it had to be said and we got to see my boy hot pie"
"Starkess",2011-06-19,"i gave it an 8 didnt quite grab me as much as id hoped but still very good the rospycelle scene was a waste i found it impossible to follow his wheezing exposition and ended up checking facebook the final scene felt a little anticlimactic and i know its nitpicky but its really bugging me that she didnt lose her hair looks a little silly and she would have only been bald for a little whileby her second chapter in acok it is already growing back but still a very satisfying end to a very well done series loved how they pulled the sheer misery onto sansas face loved to hate joffrey loved robb loved arry cant wait until season 2"
"Sega AM2",2011-06-19,"i gave it a five out of ten the opening scene was incredible with sansa and the camera work of sansa listening to joffrey on the throne but not looking at him during court was amazing but the rest of the episode seemed rushed or dull it seems hbo showed the mormont woman and it would be nigh impossible for nonbook readers to spot her the added scenes with ros are out of control at this point its almost like the scenes are written as selfparody its so ridiculous how well connected ros is is she going to sleep with everyone in the story or what how long until shes banging euron or stannis or areo hotah the added scene with littlefinger and varys had painful dialog clearly inserted to baby nonbook readers who cant figure out what the jobs of those two are i appreciate subtle conversation but this conversation was clearly this is what our characters do the first nonbook scene between them was much better dragons looked decent i guess but the funeral pyre scene lacked the loud cracks as the eggs violently split open in the books the eggs practically explode thunderously as they hatch in the show everyone takes a nap while the dragons are hatched marillion being killed by joffrey is that right what does that mean for the big finale in storm also props for making theon even more of a traitor i am your brother youll have my sword forever oops"
"Misanthrope",2011-06-19,"gave it a 10 perfect ending to a great season"
"Lord Godric",2011-06-19,"best of the season imo 1010 it had scenes that made me shiver king in the north and jons brother returning him scenes that made me sad arya leaving kings landing as arry catelyn and robb grieving and scenes that made me scared the nights watch going beyond the wall the dragons were so much better than i thought they would ever be disappointed in absolutely nothing"
"nothatso",2011-06-19,"810 i loved parts but some parts also felt very awkward im not one who is bothered by ros but the pycelle stretches afterward seemed like they were just there for filler personally i love the littlefingervarys dialogue i wasnt a big fan of the actress portraying mirri maz duur something about her acting just put me off the dragon cgi was fantastic thats about as good as it gets for a television show i really dont understand how anybody could complain about the aesthetic aspects of them unless the complaint is that they put too much money into the dragons and too little into the rest of the show"

"All-For-HotPie",2011-06-19,"plus shaggydog was pretty bad ass"
"herkles",2011-06-19,"i gave it 1010 this was by far my favorite episode of the season so much love though i agree that the roz seen did feel out of place but there was so much goodness that even that scene didnt detract from the rest of the episode imo"
"Elrick",2011-06-19,"the joffrey scene of having the singer his tongue removed was more brutal than the way it was described in the book the actor that plays joff is perfect in his role"
"tybeechris",2011-06-19,"99 01 for the rozpycelle scene otherwise incredible perfect set up for season two"
"Mr Bean",2011-06-19,"910 episode with a big fuck you to ros everything you touch you ruin having you be pycells whore no worries but seriously we lost two good scenes because you had to show up much like voyager any scene with neelix aka ros just gets worse you dont belong in this series please go away"
"MMOWarrior",2011-06-19,"i was worried about the dragons but they pulled it off wonderfully i agree though that danys hair should have been burned away as in the book but still overall terrific"
"Kaitscralt",2011-06-19,"i gave it a nine which is about as high as i go the dragons blew me away the first season of a new television show does not usually get cgi like that even on hbo i was really really impressed"
"Noir Dove",2011-06-19,"1010 brilliant i had a little get together with my friends 35 didnt know dragons were coming and 55 squealed when they did were teenagers when it comes to good stories dont judge tonguegif classbbcemoticon altp   i really cannot think of anything that i didnt like well maybe the fact that i have to wait 12 months to see any more damn it edit can i just add how much i loved old bears montage overlapping the march beyond the wall effing brilliant edited by noir dove 19 june 2011  0944 pm"
"Shepherd6",2011-06-19,"i gave it a 1010 any issues i have are minor i am really impressed with the series and the final episode gave me chills and made me tear up which is pretty cool for a tv show i loved it"
"JayDubya",2011-06-19,"id say 910  i was definitely grooving on the dragons very excited to see that scene and it didnt disappoint"
"Bowl o' Brown",2011-06-19,"loved it gave it a 10 i could have done without the ros and pycells psa on benefits of good personal hygiene and the importance of stretching before doing your ploting i love varys but his scene with lf didnt reach the bar they set in an earlier episode drogon"
"MusaYo",2011-06-19,"i gave it a 10 though it didnt have the emotional impact on me that episode 9 did i thought i set up season 2 really well loved king of the north and robb and cats scenes together and my heart was breaking for sansa even if i dont like her arya and yoren those first scenes were very powerful i thought the final scene turned out well loved the cute dragons"
"Ser Aardvark",2011-06-19,"ah roz the girl people love to hate i have to say im not in love with the character but i dont hate her with the venom other people on here do still not satisfied with the alteration done with shae unlike the others who have been changed slightly lysa syrio lord frey sam they did not change her for the better or keep the spirit of her character intact shes the whore i cant stand in the series to be honest with you other complaint king in the north scene came too early that scene should have been later imo as it wraps up robbs and cats storyline for the season and its a pretty dramatic scene in the book oh and where was riverrun maybe too complicated to throw in yet another place i understand butwhat about the riverland lords they pledge allegiance to king robb too i believe oh and i agree the egg hatching scene should have been at night with us seeing the eggs crack open and the dragons emerge in flame but thats more of a nitpicking thing and the aforementioned lack of bald dany but i knew they wouldnt let that pretty actress go bald even for an episode of season 2other than that everything else was great particular love for joff and sansa sansa really looks like shit after the execution and the actor playing joff plays the shitbird to a t seeing the hound be gentle would have had more impact if we had got more of him this season but cest la vie runner up was jon and the nights watch the direction of the old bears last speech with the juxtaposition of jon waiting for the gates opening and hearing mormont asking paraphrasing you have to decide are you a bastard boy playing at war or are you a man of the nights watch to this music was lotrlevel badassery arry and yoren was done superbly as well though was it just me or did hot pie look like he was wearing mascara and biter woot"
"RAddichio",2011-06-19,"very much enjoyed cat keeping her cool with jaime  after first inflicting some slight justice for neds death the scene with her  robb was very touching satisfying to see tyrion finally receive some positive feedback from his father and roz again proved to be the one size fits all girl about town although the dragons are cute  really would enjoy the show even more without the fantasy aspect all in all i found the entire first season to be very entertaining and for the most part remained faithful to grrms writing"
"House Snow",2011-06-19,"95 the one thing you have to be impressed by is how tidily they wrapped up each characters arc for the season while setting upwhetting your appetite for what happens next season"
"Ran",2011-06-19,"aardvark the first lord speaking when the council starts is jonos bracken his lines and we know the role was cast i agree it would have been nice to have his status noted though maybe even suggest he or someone else is officially representing the tullys at the council"
"Winterfelled",2011-06-19,"10 how can it be anything less every cliffhanger was perfect there was variety humor sentimentality they put three episodes worth of awesomeness into one we got everybody and yet we didnt feel shorted i really dont understand the nitpicking of certain characters who gives a shit about the changes they made to shae it makes her a more interesting television character its an adaptation guys if you want the book read the book"
"Metanoia",2011-06-19,"i gave it an 8 overall i enjoyed this episode but felt that it seemed lackluster in comparison to baelor a number of scenes were very well done and i was impressed with the cgi dragons something that most bookreaders were probably awaiting with some trepidation however i felt that the acting fell flat in a few places and that the rosmaester pycelle scene was particularly gratuitous i really hope that dd realize by next season that these kinds of scenes are not only jarring but irrelevant timeconsuming and detrimental to a series of this caliber the fantasy genre is already fighting hard enough to be taken seriously"
"Merihathor",2011-06-19,"9 from me a very small nitpick but those werent dragons but wyvrens very disappointing to me but oh well"
"MrDoog",2011-06-19,"would give this a 910 for what it covers in the book i thought it was near perfect my only slight complaint would be as id previously feared the lifting of the riverun siege was covered in episode 9 but thats more to do with how badly episode 9 was fucked up not this one also still not warming to shae but oh well jaqen looks exactly as id pictured him quite scary brilliant episode brilliant season cant believe ill have to wait a year for the next one sadgif classbbcemoticon alt "
"Elrick",2011-06-19,"9 from me a very small nitpick but those werent dragons but wyvrens very disappointing to me but oh wellumm how can you tell they are babies"

"Robb_",2011-06-19,"710 for me and the weakest of the first season the scenes with sansa and joffrey were excellent and most of daenerys too but i didnt care for the pycelle part and i thought the story moved a little too slowly oh and the final scenes of the night watch of the season has gotta be up there with the best really well done scene that"
"mbatter",2011-06-19,"loved it i cried like a baby though when she was saying goodbye to khal drogo i really loved them together and still hate reading the books sometimes knowing hes not there with her ugh i hate even talking about it i hope he comes back somehow and helps her kick some effing ass glad the dragon wasnt sucking on her boob that was kinda weird love jon snow hate joffrey how long until season 2"
"Aegar",2011-06-19,"1010 imo though some things did bother me a bit especially how early the king in the north scene happened that scene is my favorite in the first book and they did it 100 perfectly for the show other than its placement in the episode i absolutely loved the dragons and most of all the scene with mormonts speech and jon going beyond the wall and jaqen the look he gave arya was perfect insane foreshadowing for a tv show"
"FlameofUdun",2011-06-19,"perfect 10 i almost cried when i saw the dragons f yeah you guys made me worried about ros but it really wasnt that bad kinda liked it cant believe its over but im glad it ended so perfectly"
"lynxx",2011-06-19,"omg jaqen even if he didnt have half red and half white hair i was almost sure sansa was going to push joffrey off the bridge too bad she didnt but that wouldnt be true to the booksl shivers and tears when danerys walked into the flames thank you hbo"
"SFA-OK",2011-06-19,"6 or 7 the actor playing joffrey is pretty much perfect so far definitely do not like how theyve handled littlefinger or varys i liked how they handled the last scene the dragons look cool i think this episode showed maybe more than any other that more than 10 episodes was needed for the first season it seemed like so much was condensed into this last episode a lot of the scenes that set up the next bookseason seemed really rushed imo"
"Trebla",2011-06-19,"9 from me a very small nitpick but those werent dragons but wyvrens very disappointing to me but oh wellthe dragons in asoiaf are twolegged so technically they are wyverns edited by trebla 19 june 2011  1136 pm"

"Imp",2011-06-20,"910 a little slower for the finale than i had expected i couldnt really remember what this section of the book chapters was like still i thought it flowed much better than most of the previous episodes and all came together very well only exeception was the pycelleros scene which i didnt think was great but i didnt actively dislike it either was a meh couple of minutes"
"Salome Sand Witch",2011-06-20,"gave it a 9 because when the ros scene came on i even said out loud oh for f sakes and i rarely swear the dragon cgi was quite nice though i thought 3 eyed crow and dragons couldve been cheesy but i think theyre doing a pretty good job"
"Damocles",2011-06-20,"best episode of the series though the series as a whole i would rate a 5 or 6 id rate this a 7 and could have been an 8 it was better filmed better acted with some exceptions it seemed more within the scope of what the directors were able to accommodate given their six person cgi team it didnt have as much momentum and impact as it could have been if they had been able to give the climatic battles of the season and book a decent treatment in the episode before as it happens we havent really seen robb lead men in battle or fight and die alongside them like a king there was less focus on dany and the cheapass looking horde of some forty odd wretches and a couple dudes from the tanning salon her storyline will get better when her khalasar is actually reduced to about forty some odd wretches in actuality and theyre all ragged and dying the rozpycelle scene killed me enough already with this particular style of exposition its so unbelievably silly and stupid the varyslittlefinger scene was unfortunate peter dinklages enunciation continues to be grating but im only really going to dock them for the roz scene so 710 just compared against the series itself and not other shows who have done more and better with a lesser budget and worse source material then its a 1010 edited by damocles 20 june 2011  1217 am"
"Kuzbad",2011-06-20,"it seems hbo showed the mormont woman and it would be nigh impossible for nonbook readers to spot herwoa what did i miss"
"Joe Reed",2011-06-20,"jaqen looks exactly as id pictured him quite scary even though you dont see what he looks like him as the only hoodedguy with rorge and biter was pretty sweet glad to see gendry too i liked the actor they got for him though is seems a bit older but mehthe ros character bugs me to no end when she first showed up i thought she was gonna pretty much be shae but then well shae showed up and i was like then what is up with that ros chick so now that she is still showing up it bugs me even more the actress is super attractive and pretty good at acting but that only makes it more frustrating that she is kind of a weirdnakedexposition toolbut meh she was still pretty minor and they were smart to set pycell up as a douchebag and hell for all we know when we finally start reading adwd there will be like 50 pov chapters devoted to a character named ros and that is why she was added into the show haha910 great ep great acting solid ending and cannot wait until next year not a perfect score only because of rosshae and i thought that previous episodes were stronger"
"Daenerys",2011-06-20,"like almost every episode this one gets an 8 from me maybe 8 the pycelle scene was a waste maybe interesting to show he was just another guy in kl who is playing the game and maybe not what they seem but that would have been a lot more effective several episodes ago shortly after ned arrives were rushing to the climax here in the last episode of the season it just really slowed it down for me while not adding much also although i love me some littlefinger and varys the scene seemed poorly written to me and again a waste do we really need to have them discussing varys balls again and a gash eh could have been a lot more interesting or cut shorter pun intended wasnt marillion supposed to be this superstar bard his song sucked sorry i would not hire the dude for my kids birthday party in kl and dany should have lost her hair see my avatar on the plus side the dragons didnt look half bad at all i was worried seeing shaggydog was cool if random robb and catelyn had some nice scenes sansa didnt bother me as much as she usually does and i loved the old bears speech even though jon still seems a bit unreadable to me overall i think they did a pretty good job getting people reinvested in the series after neds shocking death which is pretty impressive in 1 hour with some wasted fluff edited by daenerys 20 june 2011  0122 am"
"Lundy",2011-06-20,"jaqen was obviously the hooded fellow the other two were rorge  biterwhich is what i said in response to others who thought theyd seen jaqen i found that puzzling as i too assumed the guy with the big sore on his nose was how hbo was doing the noseless rorge and the other would have to be biter"
"julandro",2011-06-20,"this was my favorite episode i did not expect the naked from lancel droolgif classbbcemoticon altdrool  but as ive seen sitting i wanted to see him in action that is having sex with cersei i guess for season 2 you will see the two having sex right"
"malarky1231",2011-06-20,"amazing episode did everything i expected with the exception of marillions tongue getting cut off that doesnt mean he dies so he may have another role to play in asos still i liked varys scene with lf and i enjoyed pycelles scene as well there wasnt any part i disliked and suffice to say the episode ended the season with a bang"
"The Fenris Wolf",2011-06-20,"1010 awesome friggin episode i loved all of it even the pycelle scene i thought the dragons looked amazing and i was so into that entire scene  tying that bitch of a witch to the pyre lighting the fire dany walking into the blaze the look on jorahs face like he wanted to stop her but couldntoutstanding then dany is found sitting in the ashes of her husbands funeral pyre with tiny dragons coiled around her wow that was cool i really liked the scene when the old bear was talking about fighting the real war north of the wall while the nights watch readied to ride out that was superb the lord commander has all the best lines i swear honor made you leave honor brought you back what made you think i was talking about your honor ha got to love seeing jon constantly learning so much from older wiser men on the wall the bit with sansa and joffrey on the wall was also really good when the hound stopped her from pushing him my wife nonreader laughed and said hes the only one who even knew what she was going to do how true doesnt that say a lot about that particular crowd in and of itself the director also lets you see a bit of the steel in sansa that starts coming out later whoever plays catelyn stark is phenomenal i practically choked up in her scene wrobb at the tree where she tells him to first get his sisters back then to kill them all that was powerful that look she gave over his shoulder was stonecold murder hell i was even happy with the rospycelle scene ive just surrendered to the ros at this point theyre going to slip her in there alot for their own reasons whatever if there has to be random ta at least shes smokin hot finally for anyone who is complaining about the cgi for the dragons seriously give it a rest i watched the preview of true blood that came on after this show and after multiple seasons their special effects are totally lame compared to got seriously they had these glowing fruit things that looked like cheap glass apples with lights in them then it got really trippy and these goblins started throwing balls of fire at each other it looked like an episode of the twilight zone reboot the effects were so cheesy with that to compare it to im going to stfu from now on about any cgi or effects in got"
"lokisnow",2011-06-20,"i didnt even catch it was ros with pycelle however i thought it was worth it for all the limber stretching and then the pause before he opens the door the sudden slump of the shoulders the hunch of the back and then assuming a shambling slow gate out of his room i didnt even recognize it as pycelle at the first of the scene because he wasnt his usual weezing slow witted self as he was in council and then to follow it with varyslittlefinger repartee just to subtly underscore the point that all three of these leading council members are not what they seem very very clever i also love the suggestion that benioff and weiss are planning on using ros to parallel shae in some way i think pycelle is a bigger player than weve realized and the entire reason we need ros in the show is that in season 2 and 3 were going to need some pycelle scenes and those scenes cant exist unless he has someone to talk to"
"John (Snow) Doe",2011-06-20,"8 a lot of great stuff definitely instilled in me a sense of and the story goes on i thought the pycelle scene was pretty unnecessary  wouldve preferred more closure for the main characters weve grown attached to i thought the ending for jon was actually more powerful than danys because of the great allusion to the very first shot of the series as for danys ending  i was genuinely impressed with the dragons but i think the blackout and switch from night to day lost a lot of momentum the scene wouldve been more powerful had they followed my memory of the book and shown the dragons flying out of the fire into the night sky awesome seeing a teaser of jaqen  it felt like a nice tilt to loyal readers whore eagerly awaiting his tv premiere nonviewers obviously have no idea what to expect very powerful performances from tywin and jaime  having heard gossip about mixing seasons and events from different books i was concerned cat was going to release jaime in their final scenevery thankful that didnt happen did anybody else pick up on anything from other seasons"

"freamon",2011-06-20,"910 i loved the opening scenes with bran rickon cat and robb brought tears to my eyesi was annoyed by how horrible jaime was to cat he said the same mean things to her in the book too but that was after they kept him in the dungeon for quite a while even jaime would not propose warming her bed only days after her late husbands beheading hes not that terrible a person and i could do without a threeminute monologue from pycelle good thing roz was there to stare at the whole timeeverything else was awesome by the way that singer was obviously not the marillion from the books hes an amalgam of marillion since hes the same actor from the cattyrion inn scene and the tavern singer to whom joffrey did that but when time comes to show marillion in the eyrie i am certain they will show another actor and actually introduce him as marillion i dont remember him saying his name in the inn scene in the show edited by freamon 20 june 2011  0212 am"

"Rand",2011-06-20,"910i actually liked the scene with littlefinger and varys the back and forth was a nice break from more of the plot driven scenes that seemed to dominate this episode i agree a bit with the roz scene however i think the aim was to show maester pycelles subtle charade although that in it self is probably overkill as welli liked the last scene i think if we heard the eggs crack or any sign of the dragons beforehand it would take away from the very moment you see the dragon peak out from her shouldermy main complaint is that they should have made this season 1214 episodes so that they didnt need to rush scenes and jump from plot point to plot point but since the budget was already so large and it probably wouldnt be possible i am thrilled with this final episode and the season in generalthe way i see it maester pcyelles scene combined with littlefinger and varys are there to help foreshadow tyrions battle at court as the kings hand next season weve only scene the first two as players so far the new audience doesnt know that pycelle is a lot more cunning than he seems as wellanyways 1010 for me dont think i could ask for anymore"

"McGinnis",2011-06-20,"i gave this one a 910 not sure if id say it was the best episode of the season although its certainly up there i thought that the pycelle  ros scene was unnecessary not just because ros isnt supposed to be there but it just felt a bit awkward and for me at least took some of the pacing from the episode in contrast to some others i actually liked the littlefinger  varys scene although i agree that theyre probably being set up a bit too much theyre definitely better in the books but i dont hate them on the show either the last scene really had me worried until it happened that is what a fantastic way to end the episode and the season nights watch scene at the end was just as good even though i know everything thats going to happen i still felt like i needed to see the next episode immediately from day one maisie williams as arya has been almost exactly how i pictured her both physically and in attitude etc loved her last scene as well looking forward to seeing some juicy tyrioncersei rivalry in the next season"

"Ealdorman Halasahr",2011-06-20,"another 8 from me great acting for the most part but perhaps the woman playing mirri maz duur could have added just a touch more feeling to her lines kind of like the idea already proposed here that pycelle littlefinger and of course varys are all great players and a lot more  involved in schemes to come than they let the rest of the court believe nicely done but come on ros involved in every tiny bit of scheming listening plotting  damn she knows more than littlefinger and he knows a lot perhaps shell end up on the iron throne ok a bit harsh i know but shes doing some fast climbing up the schemers ladder id say just wondering what theyll make of her character thats all michelle fairleys doing av great job portraying lady catelyn again it must be said and maisie williams  fantastic aryaarry cool great and   we met hot pie varmpaj in swedish a literal translation im still wondering though how a person not having read the books finds this first season fun and cool surely but what about coherence and consistency and clarity  did shehe understand the plot the tale the story like most readers i guess i compared the tvseason with the book perhaps a bit too much and too often all in all a good first season looking forward to the a clash of kingsseason"
"Nick Of Troy",2011-06-20,"this episode was utterly fantastic imo from the first blooddripping scene to the final screech i loved iti was wondering whether they would show a shot of the immediate aftermath of neds beheading and how theyd go about it imust say i liked it alot with the bloodied swords and blurred shot of his head being displayed i do wish they hadnt given shots of the septa and neds heads on spikes but then im a bit of a sook when it comes to rotting bodies joffery is performing admirably as an enraging little bastard that i love to hate drygif classbbcemoticon alt  really liked yorenarya and arrygendry scenes yay for hot pie rorge biter and jaqenthe scenes of bran cat and robb were really moving too felt my eyes go watery when i saw robb hitting the tree over and over and the anguish on maester luwin and robbs faces when they recieved the news was heartbreaking probably my favourite scenes of the episode tbh sansas scenes with joffery were very good too im glad we finally see some proper character development for her in her defiance to joffery and i liked her interactions with the hound those have been sorely missed since the series beganlol  lancelbum stunnedgif classbbcemoticon altstunned  heh was kinda hoping hed keep his hat on the whole timetywin and tyrions exchange was fantastic too im really liking both actors portrayal of their characters though i cant remember if booktywin was ever so complimentory to tyrion the pouring his wine for him was a nice touch i dont quite know what to make of shae yet but so far i find her finejorah as always is absolutly fantastic looks awesome in his armour and i noticed him limping a bit too i felt so bad for dany when she woke and saw drogo for the first time although i know it led to the birth of drogon and coit still sucked to see her world fall away from her when she euthanised him my eyes watered must have gotten some dust in them or something drygif classbbcemoticon alt  her speech was great and so was her rebirth as queen of dragons rhaegal did a good job of protecting his mothers decency hahaking of the north  this part of the episode was very very good probably my third favourite bit  just behind catrobb and branluwins reactions to ned and the birth of the dragons the addition of theons vow was very nice and i think its a very good setup to whats to come i wonder whether theyre going to change the iron island storyline a bit with theon being less willing to go through with his fathers plans the wall  these were decent but not really outstanding not to say i didnt like any of it indeed the old bears speech and jons intervention from his friends was very nice to watch pycelles monologue was a bit tedious and unedded imo though i reckon it gave a bit of history to the nonreading audience a bit like brans exposition to osha vagwashing was a littleunneededbut honestly i dont mind roz as much as others seem to hate her i dont really know what purpose she holds in the series yet except to be the token ta and expositional pillowtalk but well see how she develops as the series progresses this particular scene could have been cutshortened imo as it doesnt seem to do much except give us the maesters opinion of joff as kinglittlefinger and varys little chats are fast becoming a favourite part for me i love their verbal duels each trying to probe the other for weaknesses and their backhanded snipes at one anotherother things of notewow both a rickon and shaggy sighting send a raven to missing personsdragons hurrah the threeeyed crow finally gets some explaination hope they decide to expand its role beyond recycling the same clip 3 timesdragonsall up a solid 95 edited by nick of troy 20 june 2011  0700 am"

"Tywin's bastard",2011-06-20,"great ending to the season the only negative things i could say are nitpicks and im definitely not going down that route the final scene with dany and her dragons was really nice and it was one of the things i was worried might not work as well when you actually see it instead of just imagining it i like the acting of robb more and more so it feels comforting that hell be able to carry the stark banner well in the future overall all the reactions to eddards death were acted really well and definitely stirred up emotions for me a great way to continue on the ending of the last episode both the mormonts keep standing out as well in the acting department we readers can also find a ton of small details to enjoy as always one thing that stuck out particularly to me was how the look tyrion gave when tywin answered the question why he was sending him to kings landing with youre my son as a reader i found it fit very well with the thoughts tyrion have at that moment as he realizes tywin has given up on jaime theres lots of good things but i guess its enough to view back on the entire season and realize that its been a great success they have managed to set a new standard for fantasy on tv just as the lotr trilogy changed how everyone viewed fantasy on film if anything should be lifted out above the rest id have to pick the cast which has done a great job and could have carried the show go great heights even if it only looked half as good"
"The hairy bear",2011-06-20,"just gave it a 6 perhaps ive been too harsh and it deserved a 7 but imho no more the acting was great as usual and the script consistent my main problem i think was with the direction opposite to how last week alan tylor was able to make neds beheading a greater moment that in the books themselves some scenes that were amazing in the books were disminished here in particular the king in the north scene didnt have the needed epic feel and i couldnt help but being disappointed with the closing scenes the worse thing was how it seemed like everyone had gone to sleep while dany was not burining in this tiny pyre thumbsdowngif classbbcemoticon altthumbsdown  this finale failed in the places i expected more from it"

"Winterfelled",2011-06-20,"if ros necessity to the show isnt clear yet to some of you i guess you just dont care to understand shes obviously a vehicle for the show to get glimpses into for now ancillary characters while maintaining a sense of cohesiveness shes how we learn about theons insecurities and overcompensation how we get to find out pycell isnt quite the feeble old coot we thought he was and what makes littlefinger tick yes the scenes could have been played without a single unifying character but none of those scenes would have played as strong without her there its not just some nameless voiceless extra its an actual actress who knows how to listen and how to react and how to sell these moments rozs reaction to pycells rambling anecdote was what grounded the entire scene so how could her presence be bad its such a silly nitpick and if you think its a coincidence that the one hboinvented character just so happens to be taking the brunt of the fan backlash youre mistaken people hate her for no other reason than the fact that she isnt in the books thats it and nothing more"

"JagfyrBlackfyre",2011-06-20,"o man seasons finally over and what a wait it will be til next spring thankfully episode 10 was great and still managed to amaze me despite the fact that ive read through game of thrones twice within the last couple months still i gave it an 85 rounded to a 9 mostly since i was expecting a bit more from the final scene the scenes new to the storyline aka not the book stuff were great this time around although the maester pycelle scene was drawn out far longer than it needed to be to prove its point pycelles untrustworthiness should have already been established in the minds of anyone paying attention to the show let alone the books he is portrayed as an opportunistic lannister creature from the moment he seems to deflect the well founded speculation that lannister men are behind the initial ravagings in the riverlands scene where ned holds court i guess the writers wanted to make it more apparent that he truly is as fake as they come in kings landing which is saying a lot having ros in the scene works for a simple continuity i dont see what the complaints regarding her are all about besides shes hot although pycelle in that sheerish robe is most certainly not the greatest addition was the scene with robb and caitlin in their state of grief something the book passed over more than i would have preferred given the humanity of all the characters in a song of ice and fire the final scene is an amazing addition to the storyline of course however i wish it had played out more similarly to the way it did in the books not because im a tothebook pain in the ass loyalist but because the book scene was better imo the lack of not seeing the comet took away from the magic of the scene also the comet gives continuity to the overall storyline since everyone in the world can see it and if anything it means a resurgence of magic  a theme that will strongly develop in the episodes to come it would have been an easy cgi addition to the scene too since you can easily superimpose it on a solid black night sky the biggest difference is how the scene ends in the daytime seemingly hours later rather than seemingly minutes later in the book its strange that dany would have just been chilling there for hours with her dragons it may add more weight and mystique to the scene to end it the way they portrayed it but theres something about the ferocity and power that was lost from not having the spell work as quickly as the fire burns im not going to nitpick the fact that dany still has her hair  it makes her seem all the more untouchable by fire also the visual of her and the dragons was beautifully done and not just because emilia clarke is super bangin it reminded me of botticellis birth of venus painting and truly this is a rebirth for dany the dragons were also really cool even cute looking they would definitely make awesome pets especially since you would never ever need to buy another barbecue ever again"
"Asha<U+0097>Not Yara!",2011-06-20,"i actually didnt remember the comet appearing at the end of the first book because there was so much going on the detail escaped my attention i figured when i read the second book it came shortly after the dragons arrived and after the first book ended surely the moment was magical enough that not having the red comet appear matters that much i think it might have been a bit cheesy actually as the dragons were more than sufficient but i enjoyed how different characters in the second book interpreted the comet so i kind of hope itll be included in the second season personally i figured when i read the book that it was a natural phenomenon and people subscribed to whatever superstition they wanted for it edited by mellisandra 20 june 2011  0455 pm"

"Synjin",2011-06-20,"loved it gave it a 9 i really disliked the actor portraying joffrey in the early episodes i just thought it was poorly acted though it was likely due in part to the way he looked didnt jibe with how i pictured him reading the series at all hes gotten noticeably better as the episodes advanced and i thought he was great in this final episode especially the scene with the singer and then the following one with sansa and the heads my feelings about the actress portraying sansa are almost identical to those i had for joffrey too wooden not pretty enough not bubbly teen enough she did very well the last 3 episodes and she nailed this final one lastly i was very disappointed in the actress portraying of mirri maz duur her inflections were like someone poorly faking an accent and her face couldnt convey even basic emotion even in her big monologue its too bad too because visually she was exactly the way i imagined her i loved the scene with mormonts speech to jon as they head north through the wall great stuff the actress portraying dany did really well in all her scenes in e10 like others i was a little put off by the night to day thing at the end and her being bald after the fire would have been better though i dont blame emilia clarke for not wanting to shave her head it would be nice if she would have dyed those eyebrows to the same color as her hair its a little disconcerting during her close ups the draperies should match the rug so to speak the king in the north was good i thought it could have been a little better and would have been better placed later in the episode perhaps between the dany fire  dragons scenes i love the greatjon character from the books and the actor playing him is doing excellent i just wish he was about a foot taller 50100lbs heavier and with a much bushier robert baratheonlike beard another instance of my imagination fitting with the casting of hbo as always the book is better than the tvmovie version but honestly i have been superimpressed with what theyve done then again i really didnt expect less from hbo good tv there"
"Tywin's bastard",2011-06-20,"the actress portraying dany did really well in all her scenes in e10 like others i was a little put off by the night to day thing at the end and her being bald after the fire would have been better though i dont blame emilia clarke for not wanting to shave her head it would be nice if she would have dyed those eyebrows to the same color as her hair its a little disconcerting during her close ups the draperies should match the rug so to speakwhile it might not help your enjoyment of it its perfectly possible to have naturally different colored hair and eyebrows i went to school with a blond girl who had very dark eyebrows so it does happen and the targaryens are pretty special so its at the very least not unrealisticas for your final comment about the series it matches mine as well the show has of course no chance to actually match the books since its an inferior medium but it still managed to impress in its own way"
"Silverjaime",2011-06-20,"just finished viewing as im the uk side of the pond this ep was absolutely brilliant from the first dramatic scene  im so pleased they continued from last ep and didnt cut away from neds death to somewhere else  to the end with dany and the dragons it hardly put a foot wrong well except for the obligatory naked roz scene now we get her washing her bits and pycelles rambling exposition which just didnt seem to belong among the rest of the more epic scenes i mean who cares if pycelle isnt what hes pretending to be who is we can see theyre all twofaced and deceitful but apart from that  excellent episode wonderfully epic lots of stirring and emotional scenes beautifully acted all round  and having not been a bookdany fan at all i wasnt expecting to like showdany so much  emilia has really won me over in the last few eps sansa is much more sympathetic than in the book i hated her forever but sophie is showing her as more nuanced and suffering jack gleeson continues to amaze  what a brilliantly evil and hateful little git his acting has been super the brothers bringing jon back  the hair on the back of my neck stood up when they recited the vow king in the north  another such moment and good grief iain glen is one of the sexiest men in the show  he should wear halfopen shirts all the timejust sayin jaime looking halfashamed when confronted by catelyn tywin and tyrion youre my son still not impressed by sourfaced shae lf and varys sparring  though the last scene of theirs was funnier poor little arya having to join that frightening band of nogoods and her hair is so cute gendry looking tough bran and rickon in winterfell where winter is coming and the dragons really well done beautiful cgi emilia was so graceful and proud i could go on and on well done to dd for this one  and it beautifully sets up the storylines for s2 cant wait"
"AndyC",2011-06-20,"well nitpick mode on where do i start firstly theres the  oh i dont have the heart for that this was excellent yes there were some changes from the book but i fully accept that its an adaptation adaptations have to have some changes  the medium is so different the ones that annoy me are changes that detract changes that are unnecessary or gratuitous changes that throw you out of the world its trying to depict in my opinion there was none of that in this episode and some of the changes added to the storyline yoren arry hot pie and lommy gendry  all worked very well my wife commented that arya is going to have to start binding her chest to pass for a boy much longer though but thats not a criticism of the adaptation or maisie williams the grief of cat and robb  worked very well the winterfell scenes worked very well the little lad playing rickon was very impressive for such a young actor  he carried off his scene perfectly the nights watch scenes were excellent  id feared we might lose these ones in the adaptation but they were very powerful the recitation of the oath to jon genuinely got my blood tingling the scene of them riding beyond the wall was great joffrey was perfect  someone give that kid an emmy the scene with sansa and the heads  and her nearattack on joffrey only seen  and stopped  by the hound worked very very well plus it set up the hound for next season id learned that there was a ros sexposition scene with pycelle no less and when it started my heart started to fall but it actually worked  getting over the history of aerys showing pycelles pretences without degenerating into a softcore porn flick no cringing required great relief from me the king in the north yes dany  worked very well i had feared that the dragons wouldnt come out too well but that was unfounded i have no choice but to rate this a solid 1010 like episode 8 an excellent capstone to the season kudos to benioff and weiss and all who worked on it"
"Greyjoy67",2011-06-20,"that scene with pycelle and ros was weird  they could have cut that really lots of emotion in that episode though another case of poor wee bran on the go  he lost his dad as well now and the scene with catelyn and robb was heart wrenching they really nailed those kind of scenes cant believe its already over for a season give it an 8 its odd rating episodes because virtually every episode has its moments good and bad"
"Abaddon",2011-06-20,"but thats exactly how it plays out in the book so whats the complaint she does burn mmd in the books and the mad king did go crazy and start burning people aliveplease reread what i wrote this is an observation regarding how the inserted not in the books pycelle scene reflects on what we see happening with dany and casts a more ominous light on it than we might otherwise view it ini suppose you could say that dany burning mmd immediately made you think of the mad king in the books and if thats the case well i guess that aspect of the scene was superfluous to you i certainly did not make that connection in the book and i thought the pycelle scene making that connection worked well to do just thatedit just to make sure this is clear i liked the scene this wasnt complaining edited by abaddon 20 june 2011  0521 pm"
"TheMountainThatAbides",2011-06-20,"i gave it a 910 not the best episode of the season but certainly up there with the best ones the reason for it not being the best for me is the fact that there was too much nonreader stuff in it again the conversation between baelish and littlefinger even though i love them both in the series was layed on too thick imo as well as the pycelle scene i understand why they have to do it but cant help but dislike those scenes though maybe on my rewatch ill enjoy this season more some more nitpicky stuff i though mmd delivered some of her lines a bit hasty and one of my favorite all times lines was delivered differently from the book wtf was that about jaime saying there are no men like me only me its theres only me why in the world would they shorten that sentence i think the original works just fine apart from that there was a lot to love about this episode i was on the edge of my seat and scared to death towards the end because the scene with the dragons was going to be a make or break scene if they had looked crappy that would have been the end of the show for me but they nailed it to perfection really spot on loved it"

"Twisted Monkey Demon",2011-06-21,"what a great end to a great season i honestly wasnt sure if hbo could do the books justice in only 10 episodes but they did it and they did it well all of the actors were fantastic even sophie turner sansa who hadnt really impressed me until episode nine i thought jack gleeson joffery was amazing and disturbing as an emerging tyrant in this episode and i can hardly wait for next season because i think he has the potential to really bring jofferys character and cruelty to life the king in the north scene was one of my favorites from the books and the show really pulled it off i had chills also great were the littlefinger and varys scene there really wasnt much dialogue to it but there was good tension and chemistry and the scene between catelyn and jamie with just a single look of painangershame at hearing catelyns question of justice i suddenly believed that nikolaj costerwaldau could be a convincing jamie jamie is probably my favorite character in the books and his characters transformation from incestuous prat to honorable knight should be really entertaining maybe im being picky but i wasnt crazy about the scenes on the wall this season including this episode likely thats because im comparing it to north of the wall which has the potential to be terrifyingamazing i also thought the dragon scene could have been done better i mean did they all pass out for a few hours and wake at once danys hair is flame retardant i know that dany is supposed to look shellshocked but the result was a look of forced bewilderment the dragons looked great but im going to be realistic and guess that they will only appear in season 2 a handful of times for budget purposes i wasnt upset by roz and pycells scene although it was drawn out it showed that pycell is shrewd and playing an act as well he likely also knows that roz is a spy for littlefinger and wants to appear a vacuous old man i gave the episode a 9 out of 10 and would have given it 95 great acting great way to end the season lots of good tieins going forward to season 2 i was just really disappointed by the ending scene look how youve spoiled me grrm i give the first season a 95 overall amazing series and has the potential to get better i love the way the story is driven by each unique character but there is risk in this as well all in all i think some of the epicness was taken out of the story this season in favor of developing the characters there were no big battle scenes no melees or shots of large armies but each characters progression was so real and emotional that i was hooked right away i cant wait for season 2 edited by twisted monkey demon 21 june 2011  1214 am"

"Holymoly",2011-06-21,"gave it an 8 the series as a whole gets an 8 as well overall there were no real howlers although i do feel the structure of a tv series suffered by trying too hard to remain absolutely faithful to the book in retrospect i feel more may have been achieved by basing it on the book rather than adhering almost word for word to the written word the reason i say this is as the books evolve more and more the story is driven along from the point of view of the younger cast members and it will be a heavy load for them to shoulder as time goes on for me however the first book is the best of the series so far and as a stand alone exercise the tv series did a good job with a limited budget the stand out performances were obviously bean and dinklage although im confident charles dance will more than ably take his share of the plaudits in the next series"

"CryFenril",2011-06-22,"of course the watch riding out beyond the wall and seeing the screamingburninghatching was awesome and i could even understand pycelles scene as a piece of knock knock hes a player too shae still sticks in my craw but she didnt manage to ruin the episode for me despite my misgivings ill give them a chance with it grenn jon sam and pyp in the woods  wow admittedly the wheep when sam gets knocked off is horse is pure comedy but that didnt detract from the solemnity of the recitation of their vows for me its just so so so very sam the conversation between tyrion and his father was epic on a personal scale as was the verbal sparring between varys and petyr  who both come across as shallow brilliant and very very dangerous catelyn being tempted to brain jaime for good with that rock and dropping it instead whooo i dont think id have had the strength to let it go my respect for her went way up with that one  which i think is why they added it what won the episode for me was iain glen the look on his face when he said i wont watch you burn and after she kissed his cheek is something you can only get from a truly superb actor it was the instant that he realized how much she meant to him and i cant imagine it being portrayed any better won my vote anyway all the mysticality and cgi aside this is a human drama and that was a moment of drama that completely took me into the story if i hadnt liked the series before that it might not have been strong enough to save it for me but already thinking they did a good job made this kind of the coup de grace in toto id say it was one of the strongest episodes of the season which is good considering it has to hook a substantial audience into waiting for next spring i think that that strength comes from the interactions between characters as much as if not more than it does from the special effects or environment it seems like the actors have finally relaxed into the people they are supposed to be and are able to bring more out of themselves"
"Envie",2011-06-22,"i gave this final episode a 9 out of 10 i really really liked most all of it im in the camp that didnt mind the extra varys vs littlefinger verbal sparring and pycelle w roz scenes at first i was doing a head scratcher as to why they felt the pycelle thing was necessary but as i said in the other thread regarding it  i think it was necessary to help nonreaders better understand just how corrupt all of the little council members seem to be at this point all vying for some small power within the castle  they too are playing the game of thrones in a different way than those out on the battlefields showing pycelle feigning his weak old man routine is a good way to help watchers who didnt get all the details in the books to see behind the facade i docked a fraction of a point for the bouncy scene to scene rushing i felt it was a little rushed to cram everything in that final hour this season really could have used just one or two more episodes to flesh out the final setup for book 2 in my opinion i also docked another fraction for my disappointment that daenerys hair didnt get burnt off like in the book a nitpicky detail to be sure but it seemed significant to me in the book and as someone else said signified her rebirth along with her dragons i felt moving up the scene between catelyn and jaime from book 2 to book 1 was a good move for plot sake but i wasnt sure i liked the way catelyn portrayed it in the television version finally the last tiny fraction of a point will go to shae like others im not crazy about the way they are portraying her last episode or this final one either overall my fractions of one point dont add up to much but nitpicking and opinion like everyone else it was a phenomenal season end and hbo and the creators get massive kudos for tackling such a monster saga as this one and doing it justice i had huge doubts going into the idea of watching this on hbo  but my skepticism was immediately put to rest from the first episode right on through to the last the dragons look great two thumbs way up"
"Carldog",2011-06-23,"finally got to watch it good ending for the first time since the begging of the season the show felt epic lets hope they come back next year with some more  and step things up a little gave this ep a 9"
"Giants Blood",2011-06-23,"seriously for a split second i actually thought it was a woman when the scene started then i thought it was lorasanother very skinny and effeminate guy i agree that it was very subtle and that nonbook readers would have to be paying attention to grasp the fact that not only was that roberts squire but also cerseis cousin its obviously going to be revisited in season 2 once tyrion starts manipulating himyeah i later talked to a friend nonreader who thought it was loras i then told him it was lancel and he kind of got it still i agree that they will probably focus on this more in the next series looking forward to some lanceltyrion banter"

"Lord Bloodraven",2011-06-24,"i really enjoyed the finale throughout the season i find that im constantly reminded how great the actors are i consistently find myself liking characters that i dont normally care for in the books i thought the interplay between varys and littlefinger was excellent and the behindthescenes type glimpses we get of the small council which we dont have in the books in general i also think that the closing scene with daenerys and her dragons was very good my biggest fear before watching this episode was that the dragons would be cheesy or corny but i think they are quite realistic for being mythical creatures and all i give it a 10 edited by lord bloodraven 24 june 2011  1042 am"

"Kingslayer",2011-08-19,"just rewatched it 1010 holy shit did anyone imagine the dragons would look that good danys boss speech was perfect too i swear to you those who would harm you will die screaming chills man thought marillions song was hilarious joff is great as a budding young tyrant robb is great as a budding young hero catelynkingslayer talk was fantastic the muchmaligned rozpycelle scene gave us some cool history and confirmed that the grand maester is a disgusting fraud good foreshadowing for future events arya starting to embrace the darkness was cool i killed a fat boy just like you youre a liar but im not running out of positive adjectives so yeah smilegif classbbcemoticon alt some of the negative comments almost strike me as selfparody i really liked one post in this thread that awarded the episode 510 one of the very serious complaints being the lack of a cracking sound as the dragon eggs split open im picturing a reallife comic book guy furiously typing away the text clearly notes a distinct cracking noise as the eggs hatch worst adaptation ever"
"winteriscoming73",2011-09-04,"overall i thought this was a great episode i felt more sympathy towards sansa in watching this episode than i did when reading the book when you know more about the role she has in revealing neds plans to cersei king in the north scene was awesome as was the lf and varys scene looking forward to season 2"

"Maester Sarella",2012-01-27,"oh was that ros again didnt recognize her i loved her scenes with theon up north but i kind of hate her since her appearance in the clumsily written and totally totally gratuitous sex scene in littlefingers brothel rospycelle scene i hated until ros left then when we got a peek at the real pycelle i loved it like having a little moment of pycelle pov something we dont get in the books"
"Chelly",2012-01-31,"this was the best imo the ending alone gives me chills dany rising from the pyre with the dragons clinging to her was such a powerful image as the people bow down to her she is my favorite character on the show its not your screams i want just your life she was so badass in that scene the way everything ended i am so excited for the new season"
"Santilion",2012-02-13,"i didnt like the ending with this dany rising from the pyre that link of the story is the weakest its still bearable of course but almost completely uninteresting the rest of the episode was stunning however im giving it 810 as a comparison the first episode was given 1010 by me and the series as a whole 9510 but with the death of ned and the introduction of dragon whelps i feel a bit pessimistic about season 2 even though a love dragons i must say that very few tvshows and films have succeeded in making dragons into anything else than what only small boys can appreciate hopefully theyll handle this better in got and if thatll be the case im sure itll turn epic"

"Sturn",2011-06-24,"maybe the black is just a simpler way of protraying time passing as apposed to black plus big white letters saying time passesmy first thought when watching it was that it was simpler sfx to pull off then flames my second was that it may have been more obvious to understand for a viewing audience afterwards dany is not burnt but everything else is so she is obviously still alive and obviously there is some magic at work if it ended with just flames around her and no text saying she isnt burning at all depending on how well they did it some viewingonly fans might have been confused ai was she burning or not burning in those flames is she dead"

"HokieStone",2011-07-13,"my main concerns are for the second season as i can imagine audiences getting very frustrated having recently finished the second book i think viewers may struggle with the lack of scenes characters such as jaime and robb are in making them shoehorn in random scenes from the 3rd book the bran sections of clash of kings are especially boring and i can almost guarantee they wont translate well i am also worried that the arya storyline might get a little frustrating as wellshes saved shes attacked she escapes shes captured its all a bit of a rollarcoaster which does nothing for the actual progression of the storyline i cant imagine that theyll bother with the war at kings landing either as ships are expensive i just finished a book 2 reread as well and am wondering some of the same things i imagine theyll show robb more but im really wondering about jaime hes barely in book 2 however his talk with cat or at least the gist of it that happens near the end of book 2 there is no one like me just me was actually put at the end of season 1 on the tv show so i wonder if theyll accelerate his release from riverun of course to do that theyll need to get brienne on the scene earlier and she doesnt show up until after cat wanders down to visit renly and see him get killed so theyll have to start moving the timeline significantly as for the bran scenes being boring i imagine theyll just speed up theons assault on winterfell i wonder if asha will be in show more than she was in the book  she was only in 2 chapters or so maybe theyll just leave her out of the show"

"Joe Reed",2011-08-13,"9510 very high score despite having a few qualms of course the first book kind of lacked battle scenes to begin with but i think even people who didnt read the books probably thought it was kind of weak how they just knocked tyrion out and oh hey the battle is over guy i also felt that their refusal to have flashback scenes really limited the series and made them go for the sexpositiontechnique that they ended up doing with the character ros i disliked ros a lot like most people i figured she would just become shaes character but she didnt and they actually introduced shae as some really angry foreign chick instead finally i was meh with who they got to play lf i liked the guy in the wire alright and think he is a good actor it is just that lf was pretty overthetop slick in the books imo and the actor played him more lowkey if that makes any sense ultimately though the show was awesome superb casting great acting great sets solid fight scenes good music great acting cute girls british accents and great acting"

"mmp",2012-03-22,"having read got prior i thought hbo did a nearperfect job considering the budget  episode constraints my only critique is the extent to which they sexed things up i expect sex and violence in a got adaptation but the producers decided to fill in some backstory greyjoys targaryens littlefinger with ridiculous sex scenes i think these are important stories to tell but if you need to constantly flash tits to hold your audience then youre doing something wrong i think that the arys backstory told through robert selmy and jaime is a model for how they should fill plot gaps no gimmicks just people standing around talking"

"Envie",2011-06-22,"i felt like the only reason they threw this strange pycelle scene in there which wasnt in the book at all was to remind watchers of the corruption going on with the three main characters on the small council so the watcher better understands the job tyrion has ahead of him to clean up the mess thats being made theres also the throne room verbal sparring between littlefinger and varys again to further aid the watcher in understanding how these people are all vying for power within their own little circle around the throne and some of them even pycelle are hiding their true intentions and whose side if there is one they are on at first i thought was this scene really necessary  but then i realized without reading the entire first or second book you probably wouldnt understand at all how immensely complicated and corrupt things are everyone probably assumes pycelle is this ancient old fool whose blind to everything going on when in fact hes quite the opposite maybe this goofy scene with roz is a tool to convey a hint at the drama to come in season 2 once tyrion arrives to take charge as the hand"

"Horus Ex Machina",2011-06-25,"wow i just got banned from the something awful forums for expressing this opinion i didnt like the littlefingerbanging scene either since it could have been handled differently even if they kept the whores in the scence however with that said i do think that there is a default switch in most ppls minds to instantly dislike any scene that roz is in and thats way overly simplistic many ppl seemed to completely miss or otherwise misinterpret the significance of the rozpycelle scene bc of that and i actually think that the scene was well performed even roz acting was believable and nuanced but ppl are now conditioned to turn their brains off as soon as she comes on screen personally i dont think that shes been a bad addition or that the information and things that they chose to use her character as means to convey were wrong they have a limited amount of time to convey an almost limitless amount of information and one of the best ways to get that done is through excessive monologues well in a world where telling your secrets can get you killed one of the few believable times when a person is at their most truthful is postcoitus also remember that just as the spider uses his little boys littlefingers whores are not only his employees any one of them could also be a potential part of his information network part of the reason why pycelle chooses to feed roz unintelligible nonsense now i was expressing an opinion there somebody please tell me whats wrong with that"

"Lord Varys",2011-07-04,"the point of the pycelle scene clearly is to show that he is not just the old walking corps various kings use to read their proclamations until that point he is just a walking corpse who apparently does everything he is told rather sloooowlyyy but pycelle really makes himself more frail and old than he really is in the books he especially likes to use his age as an excuse if he doesnt want to talk about something in the scene with ned and him about jon arryn the time in the black cells clearly broke him somewhat but he still is not yet the walking corpse as which he appears to tyrion later and to jaimecersei in affc we actually see that this guy who is well in his 80s is cerseis most competent advisor during her time as queen regent the series needed to establish that he is somewhat on the same level as varys and littlefinger especially as most of his corpses are going to be dragged into the light in the next season meaning his involvement in jon arryns death and his treasonous counsel to aerys most especially his weirdo loyalty to tywin and cersei in the tv series he is not suspected to be a lannister crony as of yet i assume this should not come totally out of the blue pycelle needs to behave somewhat suspicious and this scene introduced the concept that he is more than capable of deception you have to be really suspicious and paranoid if you play the old fool with a whore as you most likely use whores to have sex for which you have to be physically active  at least to a degree  edited by lord varys 04 july 2011  1101 pm"
"Lord Mord",2011-07-04,"i liked the scene it just made the character for me and it helps remind us that in kings landing everybody is working an anglewe normally see pycelle as so essentially morally physically defeated he has to drag himself everywhere as though barely alive  a position of such abject humiliation that surely it must be in spite of his best efforts to then learn that he is actually able and for his age pretty sturdy and that hunching over and shuffling and the hangdog expression are a deliberate pretense which nobody not even the slickest operators in kings landing would ever suspect is exquisitely funny edited by lord caspen 04 july 2011  1127 pm"

"Unnamed",2011-06-21,"because shes the last dragon i used lizard when i shouldve used dragon theres obviously some connection between targaryens and dragons so thats what i figure happened to the kid the way i read it both times was that the baby was drogos payment and the clumsy glance to danys belly in ep 9 really confirms that to me the price for life is a death babydrogo whether shes in the tent or not the deformation figures to be a side effect of the bloodmagic that may or may not have happened whether she went into the tent or not but no doubt in my mind whatsoever that rhaego was the price for drogos life as for whether its a significant point or not well i guess i just dont know maybe thats to show how dangerous bloodmagic is because quite frankly i dont see what the taboo would be if a horse could pay for a human life even in a horse loving culturehmm its definitely an interesting point that a horse isnt a high enough price to pay for a human life then again what she bought wasnt a human life and in retrospect i think thats how i see it you can suck life out of a big powerful creature and put it into a big powerful human but theres more to being human than a living bodyalso i find it hard to reconcile this logic with mdds peregrinations she basically said or strongly implied that the horses life was what was needed wasnt so clear on what would be the payoff later she said that dani knew the price how could she you said all that you needed was a horse and im supposed to assume that youre going to kill my baby for me that interpretation just didnt make any sense so i assumed the price in question was the halflife vegetative state that drogo wound up in the way i read it you couldnt have purchased real life for drogo with a horse or a babyas far as the stillbirth i guess the fact that it came out looking like a dragon was more eyepopping to mei just couldnt imagine that happening without it being signficant its one thing to say your baby was born dead but quite another to say youre baby was born a dead winged lizard unless we were led to believe that this was common for targaryans it strikes me as a pretty singular event bill cosby version my darling i love you very much youve just given birth toa lizardall this being said i absolutely do agree that your interpretation fits better with the way they portrayed these events in the tv show everyone saw mdd cut her eyes at danis belly and the whole thing seemed staged to portray mdd as a big fat vengeful liar which leaves the birth of the dragons as just a very strange miraculous thing that happened without any obvious cause other than danis desire for dragonsfor me thats less satisfying magic is magic but i like to feel that there exist some underlying rules that explain whats happening if bringing drogo back from the edge of death by sepsis would be a big damn deal then how much bigger of a deal is to bring back dragon eggs that have been dead long enough to have fossilized and what price was paid as you mentioned the explanation of the rules could be forthcoming later but my suspicion is that this will remain a headscratchervm"
"Patrick Tully",2011-06-21,"add in the ros factor i still dont remember her from the booksthere is nothing wrong with your memory she was a creation of the show"
"Wouter",2011-06-21,"overall this show entire first season has pulled it off much better than i had feared with the very nice cgi dragons in this episode as a confirmation while the changes to that scene were slightly unfortunate with the blackout it was still a very impressive scene with equally impressive soundtrack hbo has done very well with dany viserys jorah and rakharo throughout the season very convincing i noted with some joy that new viewers are indeed not quite sure if mirri was right or dany was right and some noted that we are probably supposed to understand both the essence of this plotline has survived the adaptation i could have done with less sexposition throughout the episodes though those scenes are downright painful at times and they dont help the reputation of the series and the genre imo i also thought it somewhat disappointing that lf is so inyourface in this adaptation some banter with varys is fine but book lf is very stingy with his secrets even to sansa in book 4 he says only so much about his plans based on the show alone i would think varys is portrayed as the stronger schemer as he seems more able to keep things to himself amusing to see that many new viewers seem to completely buy that varys is working for the good of the realm which seems at least doubtful in the books also somewhat curious to note that a number of reactions here say that they now have sympathy for showsansa that they didnt have for booksansa  and this while her scenes in ep 10 are really only an abridged version of her final chapter in the novel with the headsonspikes scene being very true to the books and with the showversion of sansa actually being older than booksansa and with show sansa even showing a bit of a mean streak in the jane espenson episode pretty much the opposite from book sansa one should actually expect less sympathy from the viewer ok the scene was done very effectively and i guess it helps to see it visualised on tv  but imo it was easy to visualise it from the books as well and very hard not to feel sympathy for sansa there ive always been shocked by those readers who stated that sansa didnt get half of what she deserved in the books and that she should have been beaten harder a pity that they changed catelyns reaction to neds death quite a bit as ran noted in his recap but i guess her line we will kill em all can be explained away as repeating robb in the heat of the moment at least the shots of her during the king of the north scene were ambiguous as to what she thought about it  ive read very different interpretations of catelyns expression there catelyn can still turn to peacemonger next season without much difficulty i wonder if next season we will see an explicit oath of the riverlords to robb as this is still missing in the show arya was fabulous in the series especially in the scenes with syrio forel  really felt like the books were coming alive there jon at the wall worked very well too the final scene with the nights watch riding out was excellent interesting that they have played down the flashbacks and prophetic elements so far  maybe to help surprise new viewers i do hope we get meera and jojen reed next season though those are very important for brans storyline also becaise meera has a fair bit of exposition in the books that the show could copy verbatim without being campy bran is another character done very nicely in this show all in all it was impressive less whores other than shae a change which i dont mind so far as showshae actually seems more likable than bookshae and less sexposition please though if the reactions are anything to go by grrm is going to selling a lot of extra books soon many say they cant wait 9 months boy are they in for a shock after the finish book 5 congrats to him this must be quite a triumph for him considering how he left the screenwriter business edited by wouter 21 june 2011  0234 pm"
"CryFenril",2011-06-21,"im in agreement that changing shae into a cold worldly calculating conniver who is capable of subtle deceit is a huge change from her character in the book and can cause serious changes in her actions or the impetus behind them in the future book shae is easily swayed by those around her and takes delight in things like seeing golden castles made out of clouds she is inelegant enough to beg to go the feast in front of the one man who doesnt want her to go she asks for her silks and satins and jewels back she doesnt demand them she pouts she whines she sulks but she never once takes the upper hand not so our new showshae showshae takes what she wants and is willing to rip someone up verbally to get it she is aggressive provoking socially literate and able to hold her own when conversing with tyrion she challenges him  not something id think hed appreciate considering his relationship with his sister and his father"

"Mad Sweeney",2011-06-21,"mirra never says the horse is the price tho she merely says it wont cost dany her life she only mentions that they need the horses blood in the books its clearer that all the violence that erupts as mdd begins the ceremony is the price being paid i dont think mdd intended in the books to kill the baby that was a consequence of jorah carrying dany into the tent the show depicted it a little differently but even there dany repeats mdds line about only death paying for life and the line about wanting her life not her screams astute viewers should be able to connect that with the dragons birth altho its heavily implied in the books that the same ceremony that returned thee semblance of life to drogo started the transformation of the eggs as they were in the same room maybe the spell affects any dead thing within range as dany is dreaming about them while unconscious after giving birth and to her they feel warm when she wakes a scene or two making that point would have been nice mdds death and perhaps even drogos is the final spark they needed to hatch but they werent just fossils when she placed them on the pyreshe absolutely did especially if your first 2 sentences are true and the horse wasnt the deathprice i dont know how it could be any clearer in the books or the show that rhaego was the price for dragos life"

"Mad Sweeney",2011-06-21,"weve all acknowledged that the tv show aint the book and some changes are necessary but this change is particularly jarring because it makes the whole tysha thing more of a macabre detail in tyrions life rather than the central defining event that it is in the bookvmand again ill say until we see what they do with the tyrionshae relationship making judgments or predictions like this are silly were all in agreement that for the most part dd have done an outsstanding job transforming a complex book series into a compelling and well done tv series we also all agree that tyrion is possibly the best character in the books and his relationship with shae is probably the most important relationship in the books i mean theyve had what 1215 minutes of screen time together out of roughly 600 so why in the name of all the gods do people think that dd are gonna screw this up edited by mad sweeney 21 june 2011  0746 pm"
"Mad Sweeney",2011-06-21,"cersei married robert about eighteen years earlier  right after the rebellion she was also considered as a bride for rhaegar she was not fifteen at the time of her wedding she and jaime are approaching forty at least robert and cersei have been married almost as long as eddard and robert and the starks have a son robbs age nikolaj is 40 and looks it trust me youd not think him significantly younger than me fitter but not younger if you met both of us and i havent seen 40 in some timeeta the timeline works even less in jaimes case the age of majority in westeros is 16 and you have to have enough time before the war for jaime to be a knight for at least a couple of years before being elevated to the kingsguardi thought he was 16 when elevated the youngest ever fifteen when he won a tourney and became a ser then the war was pretty quick after that i thought so he was 17 or so when he killed aerys then 17 years to present so early to mid thirties then hes also iirc which is in doubt due to the post you replied to the youngest capt of the kg which is useless knowledge since i dont know who the second youngest washowever this still puts tyrion in his early 30s since obviously it was at least a year after jc were born when he was born"

"Sega AM2",2011-06-22,"its good for you if you can rationalize the tv shae into tyrions character arc it sucks for me because i cant doesnt mean that i hate the tv showi love most of it but every time she appears on screen and speaks it tosses me right out of the story because im thinking the real tyrion would just as soon have a snake in his bed of course the real tyrion is probably different for every reader of the books clearly your real tyrion is far different from mine what im reminding you is that im not trying to prove to you that youre wrong and im trying to describe my real tyrion and why i imagine him this way the only person who could definitively say what the real tyrion would do is grrm and if he did it appears that it could ruin the story for half of usthis is also why i hate tvshae she is so starkly different from the books that it breaks all immersion i have when im watching the show and she appears her acting and dialog are so jarring that i am thrown out of the story and all i can think about is how wildly different this is from the books the changes to shae are by far the most egregious to me even worse than ridiculously changes like littlefinger telling sansa about the hounds burns or the pointless decision to swap two of the prologue characters i understood when everyone was cast up a few years in age and even grrm said that he liked that the tv characters were all older and i dont mind that the mountain is only seven feet tall on tv and not eight like in the books or that the actors who play cersei and jaime are not the same age and are both older than the actor who plays tyrion none of that bothers me at all because it isnt so glaringly dissimilar from the books i can believe that tyrion is younger on the show than his siblings and that cersei and jaime are the same age on the show i can still see that the mountain is a gigantic and fearsome psychopath but i cant believe that tv shae is at all the same character that book shae is judging by the dialog in the show shae is going to become tyrions lady at court and present at political meetings and social events and shes supposedly not even lowborn and instead of being submissive and fooling tyrion that she likes him she is instead outlandishly aggressive and domineering"

"The Knight of Grasses",2011-06-23,"while i dont think dany was performing the exact same ritual as mirri the idea of awakening the dragons requiring heat plus sacrifice is sparked by it it just resonates with her on a subconscious level because she is indeed the dragonthe first paragraph of the last dany chapter makes it abundantly clear that mirri thinks dany is trying to work a spell and she makes the same arguments that you made there basically you dont know what youre doing and it will never work later dany says i thank you mmd for the lessons you have taught me i remember what you told me only death can pay for lifeto say that all it took was a hotter fire to do it takes something away from dany throughout the series we see dany being forged from the weak girl she was into the strong ruler she is supposedly meant to be the first book she is hardened later she is tempered she constantly turns adversity into opportunity always learning from what happens i believe mirri wants to leave dany in the state that mirri is in broken and everything taken from her while mirri succeeds in her plan it doesnt break dany and in fact she takes from her the key to finally accomplishing everything she intends to do on her own termson a different track i think dany getting the dragons at this point is a message from grrm to the reader that like the lannisters he always pays his debts in this case dany doesnt have to wait long though she and us will have to wait and wait and wait before she can actually do anything important and its not really a fair trade but it is one means of accomplishing her goal traded for another so we can take some heart that eventually the starks will get something in return for ned we just might have to wait a while but im sure by the middle of the third book good things will be happening for them winkgif classbbcemoticon alt i dont think the hotter fire hatching the dragons takes anything away from dany she can be strong without being able to do magic i think mmds death was symbolic and dany thinks of her son her husband and the maegis deaths as paying for her dragons but i think its pretty farfetched to assume that dany knew how to channel magic shes never thought about how it worked or contemplated doing it again or even anything like it i dont think there was any magic involved in the dragons hatching other than the bond dany shares with the dragons from being a targaryen in other words nothing dany consciously did"
"The Knight of Grasses",2011-06-23,"i think this is the part that has been the sticking point for me and the reason that i have looked for an explanation these werent just old dragon eggs they were fossilized dragon eggs they were so old that all of the organic matter had been supposedly replaced by rock so what i have looked for is what triggered or provided the magical power for the transformation into organic viable dragon eggs once thats explained i can absolutely buy that they hatched in the fire because it was hot enoughto my way of thinking when daeni was cooking them on her hibachi they were just rocks and after a certain amount of time on the coals they were very hot rocks later when she puts then into the drogo barbecue they are no longer rocks they are dragon eggs that could hatch again this is my personal theoryso it was this line of thinking that led me to the notion that daenis baby must have been the power for the transformation of the dragon eggs and it was this er process that caused the baby to come out looking dragonishvmi dont buy this at all and its because of all the clues grrm gives us throughout danys arc in the first book dany sensed quite early something about the eggs that made them feel like much more than rocks thats why she put them on the brazier in the first place doesnt the book on several occasions make specific note of the fact that they were warm why would grrm do this if it was just because they were rocks that had been warmed in the sun as i said i dont know when it happened  my guess would be as soon as dany made contact with them  but those were dragon eggs because of who dany is and her innate magic as being a true dragon of the targaryen house she brought them to life again and what it took for them to be hatched was the proper conditions it makes no sense to me at all that the dragons needed blood magic to be hatched or even that dany knew enough about blood magic to facilitate it she hasnt used it or referenced it any other time or any other type of magic for that matter"

"Unnamed",2011-06-27,"just a small side regarding dragons and magic  magic had not completely disappeared but was much more powerful in the presence of dragons wisdom hallayne the pyromancer from whom tyrion and cersei commission the wildfire notes that their spells are working much more efficiently now and asks tyrion in joking fashion if hes seen any dragons about and in the marketplace quaithe tells dany that the firedancers ladder is only possible because of her dragons  before the man was barely capable of controlling the flames he played withso apparently dragons arent necessary but they sure are helpful goes back to snickering about the boar and the large spoonpoint taken that magic wasnt completely gone but it sure seemed that it was weakened to the point of being useless as i recall creating wildfire or greek fire or whatever they were calling it didnt require magic but magic sure made them able to make a lot of it fasterof course im still not really clear if the dragons have some impact on all kinds of magic or just certain kinds for instance could melissandre make her shadow babies wout dragons and how can the others go around doing their reanimator routine in got before the dragons hatched im not demanding that you answer just throwing these out sorta rhetorically but if you happen to know the answersvm"

"Unnamed",2011-06-30,"heh on a more serious note i took mdds only death pays for life to mean if you want to save a particularly life from dying then something else has to die in its placei basically took it that way too however it seemed an inversion to me because i would think that it is in reality life that is paying for life with death being the way payment is made having it phrased that way causes me to wonder if there is a subtle distinction being maderegardless of the subtleties of phrasing the notion is presented as some sort of general principle as opposed to a a rule specific to the workings of blood magic and its when i try to imagine the concept as a general principle that i start having strange ideasand of course there is the fact that drogo was not actually dead yet theoretically he still had his own life to make use of if not his health if he had died and they were about to reanimate him i would have understood the transaction betterof course all this is trying to read far more into the scene than the info really justifies but its hard to resist the temptation since grrm didnt really offer much explanation as to why these singular events played out the way they did in fairness theres little reason to expect that the characters really understood either and this is a 3rd person limited structurevm"
"RSasoiaf",2011-09-04,"hmmmm just on a funny note if you really want to nitpick there is something on the ending scene which really doesn work if you look at it when they made the full stop and then its early morning we are suposed to believe that no one managed to notice both danny or her dragons during at least a couple hours from night to early morning i wonderwhat were they all doing did they all went to sleep and just left the thing burning what if it would catch fire to some tents or something nearby you knowhaving a big fire burning while everyone goes to sleep may be dangerous and what was danny and specially her dragons doing during the night was there no suspicious sounds i bet everyone thought naaaajust our minds playing tricks on us or danny was telling her dragons to keep quite or maybe dragons only scream when in daylightmaybebut it still is a bit strange also it was some stretch having danny clearly imply to jorah that she was going to enter the fire not sure he had that kind of faith and belief on her powers and im quite he would have remembered other targs who have killed themselves the same way on a not so distant past if jorah would have realized she was going in he would have stopped her by all means possible"

"Nebiros",2011-06-21,"hmm thats quite interesting however while were on topic for the pyre scene music some thoughts about that i think the music in this scene was an overwhelmingly good choice even more so than the music parts at key points during the whole series which was always wellchosen both unobtrusive and stirring when needed it starts very ominous especially during the minutes leading up to the actual burning one gets the impression of a climax approaching drums and also that in a way something sinister is happening which i find fitting its a kind of blood magic dany is performing after all  life pays for life then theres a pause during the blend over to the dawn scene the music only gradually starts again from silence when we see dany and the dragons and when she rises and drogon does his show off thing the music grows almost angelic and very hopeful in mood as a viewer it gave me the impression that this is a definite beginning of a new chapter something that changes the way of the world and that the story has only just begun i couldnt think of a better way to end this series both regarding to capturing the spirit of the book and grrms intentions and as a way to achieve closure of the season and leave viewers with a promise that there is so much more to come in the next season simply brilliant"

"MountainThatRides",2011-06-19,"fucking awesome the wolves were good the crypt scene was good the little exchange between catelyn and jaime worked the scene with joffrey showing sansa her fathers head was excellent  and im glad they kept in joffreys sentence for the singer fingers or tonguethe wall scenes were all great but nothing stood up to the final scene even the nights watch riding beyond the wall epic as it was couldnt compare to the dragons this episode exceeded my expectations and was as good as a season finale ought to bethe one thing running through my head for the whole last 10 minutes were georges words and for the first time in hundreds of years the night was alive with the music of dragons"

"Stannis_Style",2011-06-19,"i am wondering if the pycelle workout scene is more important than we think is pycelle not at all what he seems is their magic or gods involved i mean at the end of tffc he ostensibly holds the power over the throne and the most control of king tommen this could be a split from the book in some regards to keep us guessing could pycelle be the poisoner of joffrey on the show"
"Trebla",2011-06-19,"bwahahaha pycelle with ros i was laughing my ass off with what i knew would be ppl freaking out iirc pycelle is noted in the books as not as frail as he pretends to be a lot of the kl scenes were major setup for next season when tyrion arrives cersei bedding lancel lmao when she orders him to bed pycelle pretending to be frail and lf and the spider each major players in the game i practically did a squee when i saw hot pie gendry was really cool and i wonder if the other kid is lommy greenhands or just a random bully i also assumed jaquen was under the hood rorge had anose but it looked way messed up very surprised about marillion he actually came out better off compared to what mord did to him i think we should all be happy with the direwolf appearences shaggy looked badass and still more ghost emilia clarke was sensational in his episode my dad just called me super excited abolut the dragons cant wait to see how other new fans react"

"Mad Sweeney",2011-06-19,"im amazed that so many people completely missed the point of the pycelle scene with roz i am in disbeliefdont be theres a whole lot of people that cant get past quibbles and realize soeone with that much screen time has a purpose im surprised that no one has whined that the part of pycelle closing the door couldve been cut so they could show 2 seconds of something that happened offscreen in the books ill say it for the last time this season folks trust them theyve done an almost universally praised job of making a badass series out of badass books that is not easy whatsoever so show some faith ros and shae are there for a reason the impact of robbs wolf was made known a big complaint from last episode jaimes rep is being bolstered etc patience and faith trust me youll enjoy things even more if you drop the whining about the little shit you think could be used somewhere else its chess not checkersawesome job after a few sloppy episodes early on i expect theyll reap dozens of emmys for the technical stuff like wardrobe art direction both should be a lock camera and sound stuff heres to seeing some glamor wins in there too dinklage clarke and that little shit joffrey though bean will probably be in there as well its too long to get excited for next season yet but the anticipation for the book release is gonna start killing me soon with no series to tide me over got it preordered on my nook hoping it autodownloads at midnight on release day"
"jlk7e",2011-06-19,"4 tyriontywin stuff was good but shae still gets on my nerves she is far too assertive imo at this point i realize that theyre just changing her character but i dont really get why ah well not terribly importantreally it seems obvious why book shae is utterly insipid  stupid grasping and unpleasant for the show theyre obviously creating a whore who is worth falling in love with and worth defying tywin for this may or may not be a good decision im inclined to think it is but opinions may differ but its pretty obvious why theyre doing iti think it was just two random blokes  they didnt look like the descriptions of rorge and biter probably not considered worth the effortthey were in the cage which is more likely 1 that theyve put two scary guys in a cage with probably jaqen hgar but they are not rorge and biter or 2 that they have hired actors to play rorge and biter who dont look quite look the descriptions of them in the book"

"Trebla",2011-06-19,"okay i was mostly speaking for myself i didnt love the scene but youre right people should recognize the worth of the scene especially considering that the next one was a cut to varys and littlefingerthe three councillors are clearly going to be more developed which i love their little three way rivalry will make the political machinations in kl in season two that much betteri assume varys when he meets cat and she has the dagger he says he has little birds everywhere including the north theon move your leg higher ros anyways as i was sayingthis assassin showed up in brans room with a valyrian steel dagger one of those crazy wolves saved him though can you believe that shitros you dont say mlord oh harder mlord"
"Kaitscralt",2011-06-19,"also i agree with all the people sad over theons awesomeness towards robb so bittersweet but he is a main character and the writers of season one successfully got the audience to like him without the viewer being able to read all the other characters thoughts about him like readers did i expect great things from alfie in season two and his betrayal unwitting or not is going to sting so bad even knowing that it happens edited by kaitscralt 19 june 2011  0941 pm"

"Basileus777",2011-06-19,"is it certain that it was marillion and not a different bard in that scene"
"Ormond",2011-06-19,"though not my favorite episode this certainly maintained the generally very high quality of the seriesi dont particularly like the decision to get rid of marillion so early it will be interesting to see how they rewrite the later scenes he would have been ini really disagree with those who think catelyns youve ruined your sword line was lame personally i think thats exactly the sort of thing a mother like catelyn would say in that situation it might have worked even a bit better to have her say nothing and just catch robbs eye to have him come to her but what she did say is fine pointing out to him directly that there are better ways to express his grief and anger would have been much worse and more embarrassing or even belittling to robb focusing on the minor issue of dulling the sword was actually a good way for her to get him to refocus while still saving face"
"Rockroi",2011-06-19,"the best season finale i have seen in a while what i likedwhen can i stop looking yeah i get it nobody likes sansa well i really like her and i thought that scene with joff 100 from the book more or less was tremendous but her line when she sees her father and realizes <U+0080><U+0093> much to her own shock <U+0080><U+0093>that she can handle it she asks that all important question now that i am doing exactly what you want me to do when can i stop and i thought that one part was a perfect allegory for sansa it seems as if her whole life is one unimaginable torment and abuse but that she is so hard now that she takes it all she will take any abuse any torment any attack for as long as it takes <U+0080><U+0093> until you stop the king in the north<U+0080> who wanted it that way the king in the north scene was very important and they nailed it 6 ways from sunday but that one moment the actor playing robb <U+0080><U+0093>once three men kneel to him he gets that look in his eyes that very slight hint that <U+0080> <U+0080><U+009C>you know what i do want to be king in the north<U+0080><U+009D> its very subtle but its there robb beams with pride over it once somebody said the words there was that long pause <U+0080><U+0093> at robb could have said <U+0080><U+009C>absolutely not i don<U+0080><U+0099>t want to be king<U+0080><U+009D> but no he stayed very quiet that<U+0080><U+0099>s because robb liked that idea a whole heck of a lot a game of kings i liked how they integrated a great deal of the early clash of kings scenes in this last episode seamless transition is the name of this game king and his court sweet scene to underscore aerys iii hot pincers people wailing joff giggling like an idiot who wouldn<U+0080><U+0099>t want to punch that shit in the face tales from the crypt loved the scene with rickon and bran in the crypts with osha i really think that bran and rickon are going to be solid characters as time goes on i was mildly disappointed in the way lewyn broke the enws to bran i really enjoyed that part of the book <U+0080><U+009C>we    we shall need to find a stonecarver who knew his likeness well<U+0080><U+009D> but that is just nitpicking overall the scene was scary heartbreaking and gritty missed summer though the old bear just owns i think jon snow is the weakest character in the book and now in the show but his scenes arte 100x better when lord mormont takes the center stage and pontificates his voiceover speech with the scenes of them riding north was as good a transition as anything they have done in the show stupendous really great stuff tyrion and tywin closer than we think maybe the best scene in terms of dialog and acting was the whole tyrion and tywin scene showtywin has vastly more respect for tyrion than booktywin this version is far more realistic and i enjoy it much more i think its very telling how tywin has control over every aspect of his household and his men and will use them all to maximum advantage even his sons and buried in all of it is just how much of a mind tyrion has and how similar it is to tywin they think alike and they know how to play this game i think these two characters and the two actors are tremendous cat and jaime i wanted more but at least they got my sig right great scene seeing is believing i liked the growth of the varyslf dynamic and i can even take the fact that they speak so openly to one another but i enjoyed that buried in all this is the capable pyrcell not the doddering old fool he plays on seriously i am stunned people on this board did not figure out immediately <U+0080><U+0093>what they were going for there and i liked how he<U+0080><U+0099>s getting his info from rox always remember what obiwan says you<U+0080><U+0099>re eyes deceive you don<U+0080><U+0099>t trust them<U+0080><U+009D> and that old man ain<U+0080><U+0099>t that old and for the first time in hundreds of years <U+0080> so i have said it before but it bears repeating there are some scenes that when i first read them i had them designed in my head i could because martin is a tremendous writer picture and map out everything the scene had in it and exactly how it looked the scene with the mother fucking dragons looked exactly the way i had always pictured it the dragons the look in dany<U+0080><U+0099>s eyes the dragons and how they moved on her and how one of them was totally breast feeding the desecration the ruined landscape the dragons the way jorah knelt the way they all knelt and the way it all seemed to be 100 legit like you would expect that this would be the way people would react if somebody they knew commanded three badass dragons it was utterly mesmerizing and honorable mention to the woman who played the mirri maz duur i never wanted to punch a woman in the teeth more than her great acting and that woman sure knew how to scream a little meh onhey you look familiar i am not a fan of the syrio  jaquen theory so i say this with great reservations one of the guys in the cart going off to the wall totally looked like syrio with his head and beard shaved i mean he<U+0080><U+0099>s got his eyes closed as they are moving out but  yeah<U+0080> there i said it i hope i am wrong not likingshea i can tell that you will be the person who when your scenes come on screen next season that<U+0080><U+0099>s when i get up to get some food because in the end you are really just a secondary character and not a particularly interesting one at that the fact that you talk wayyyy too much just makes that worse overall this was a fantastic episode that i enjoyed back to front the series overall was a tremendous success with only minor complaints and few things that if i could <U+0080><U+0093> i would change i think this was as good a show as we could have hoped for if we ever hoped for anything great job hbo great job georgeplay resumes spring 2012 well done and we all lose our stuff july 12 edited by rockroi 19 june 2011

"Winterfelled",2011-06-19,"even better than the last episode in my opinion i think from a technical standpoint this was the first episode all season where the pacing wasnt just good but perfect nothing felt rushed or crammed or trimmed everything had time to breath there were monologues and cinematic sequences yet time enough for extensive headhopping and a dozen tiny reveals each cliffhanger could have stood alone in its own episode it really felt like a season finale honestly and truly the youve ruined your sword line was great in my opinion its just the sort of trivial thing thats said in the throes of grief i honestly dont remember if there was an analogous scene in the book but i prefer the line in the episode to a gushier more melodramatic one i had no qualms with the episode except that it was only an hour long but given how well it was paced who knows what kind of a mess could have been made out of 90 or 120 minutes best to leave it as it is i am looking forward to next season but i am very worried about how they plan on fitting that book into 10 episodes it was a sometimes terribly rushed and uneven this year with a smaller book so i cant imagine how theyre going to manage clash"

"Trebla",2011-06-19,"does anyone else look at gendry and think he should have been renly or at least an older version of the same type of guyyeah i totally thought that as well but really gendry will have much more screen time than renly so it still works out in the end"

"brian_177",2011-06-19,"i really liked this episode sans the superflous pycelle scene what the helli liked it because it lets nonreaders know that pycelle is slyly playing his own part in the gamethat hes not as frail and senile as he makes us believe"

"Andeimir",2011-06-19,"can we fastforward to april please the king of the north scene couldve been later as it is in the books but i thought that it served well to maintain the pacing and not overcrowd the second half of the episode i was a bit disappointed we didnt get a flashback and a history lesson in the catjaime scene keeping the screenshot of brandon in mind it would come eventually but i was hoping to get to see it sooner than the next season since the recollections be it in thought or dialogue tend to be favourites of mine i liked the pycelle scene while i think the tv pycelle had a shady aura to him throughout the series it did outright establish him as a character viewers sould be suspicious of in season 2 which would make the kings landing scenes even more a joy to watch all in all to me it seems like the series really kicked it up a notch in the last 3 episodes i wasnt too impressed by the first couple of episodes but as it stands im looking forward to season 2 even more than i did for this one and i really couldnt ask for more than that oh and kawai dragons happygif classbbcemoticon alt  edited by andeimir 19 june 2011  1140 pm"

"Bahimiron",2011-06-20,"awesome awesome finale i guess now we know why they spoiled the king in the north moment in the previews it happened like five seconds in i was surprised that they trimmed mirri maz durs prophecy or curse or just a nasty statement to remove the bit where she indicates that dany is no longer capable of having children when sam stood in front of jon to keep him from leaving i kept hoping that dumbledore would show up to give sam 10 points for gryiffindor since sometimes it takes more courage to stand up to ones friends than his enemies emilia clarke was great in this one nice to see rickon show up again thats what three times we saw him they probably have the same issues with him as with the dogs little kids frequently bite people and spook horses they made the scene with sansa and joffrey headspotting a little more aggressive on sansas part its been a couple of months but im pretty sure that in the book sansa wasnt thinking of pushing joffrey as much as she was thinking of jumping its a good change i liked the pycelle scene its a little random very who are you the narrator but it was a great performance by walter donovan and at least the girl wasnt roz could have done without the old man calisthenics i so wasnt sure about conleth hill as varys so strong was roy dotrices franknelsonasvarys voice but in the end i think the guys just spectacular good to see a little extra from arya otherwise the clear fan favorite wouldnt have been in there at all that haircut though dang i never imagined hot pie being that chunky dudley dursley is riding to the wall i guess also yay gendry good thing he called out having been a blacksmith or i doubt anyone would have recognized him the end was pretty fantastic but im hells of disappointed that they took out one of my favorite parts her calling on jhogo rakharo and aggo and them refusing because shes a woman only for them to change their mind and declare blood of my blood when they see what she has done"

"laughing tree knight",2011-06-20,"i always wondered after reading the book and then the episode if danys baby that was still born that when described sounds a lot like a dragon is there a chance her child was going to look that way anyway from the book reading i couldnt tell if it was really still born or they just couldnt bear to let it live or to care for the scaley baby with wings just saying initially i thought of course her childs life was taken for the drogo spell and in turn cost the life of the child leaving behind the scaley thing but what if it just cost the childs life but wasnt responsible for the dragon characteristics i mean a dragon sure sounds like a stallion who could mount the world i know its all moot unless dany every has children again"

"Atia",2011-06-20,"loved it not that there was really any doubt about that going into the finale however the women especially stole the show tonight i was especially pleased with how sansas scene turned out she is a character who has received a lot of hate throughout the first season a lot of it justifiably so but as a fan of sansa throughout the books i was eagerly looking forward to this scene in a perverse kind of way  not for the content of course but instead since it marks a major turning point in sansas character arc i loved that they kept in sansas quote about joffreys head as well as her immediate thoughts of flinging joffrey from the wall after she is struck much has been made of aryas strength but this was a moment where sansa showed what she is made of as well i was also appreciative of the hounds role being maintained in this scene after his background story was given to littlefinger i was a little concerned that the sansasandor relationship was going to be overlooked to some degree but i now think that this worry might be unfounded it was good to see the two interact even in such dismal circumstances catelyn was lovely as always her words to robb about ruining his sword seemed a bit empty to me but i suppose we all say peculiar things in times of grief so im not one to judge the dialogue too harshly mostly i loved the way she struck jaime i thought we were really robbed earlier in the season when they depicted catelyn and tyrion being attacked by the tribesmen on the way to the eyrie in the book catelyn has a particularly fierce moment where she stabs or cuts the throat of an attacker but she was a mere bystander in the series seeing her take that rock to his head in this episode is an even trade in my opinion i for one do not mind roz still showing up every now and then but i will say this  the sequence of scenes made the one between her and pycelle feel incredibly awkward upon my first viewing i understand the value of inserting an additional scene to show joffreys council and how none of them are who they appear to be but to jump from the emotional and traumatic impact of dany smothering drogo to a brandnew scene of questionable importance between roz and pycelle it feltjarring to say the least but nothing could slow the momentum of danys epic final scene it was fantastic i was a bit worried about the quality of the cgi dragons going into tonight but they were perfect and unusually cuter than i had imagined not that thats a problem the combination of this scene along with the cut of the men of the nights watch riding out beyond the wall definitely gets you pumped for the second season looking back on the season i do really appreciate the way that the show gave more time to establishing theons character in the books i just remember being so taken aback when he became a prominent figure in the second book since he had seemed so minor before then now it really made an impact to see theon swear his allegiance to robb as the king of the north i was trying not to spoil anything for my boyfriend who has not read the books but even i couldnt suppress a scowl as he knelt knowing what hes about to do and rickonshaggydog i love how our beloved future king of westeros keeps on popping out of dark corners good to see direwolves again too i literally squee each time that one appears on screen i can think of little complaints here and there but overall i am just so grateful to hbo for this first season i am really pleased with the way it turned out and i have complete faith going into the second season that they will continue to excel the entire ensemble is so deadon especially with the younger set that its truly a pleasure to watch and tonights episode was no different"
"emmank",2011-06-20,"they made the scene with sansa and joffrey headspotting a little more aggressive on sansas part its been a couple of months but im pretty sure that in the book sansa wasnt thinking of pushing joffrey as much as she was thinking of jumping its a good change actually i think in the book the thought of pushing him comes first then she thinks a few moments later that she might fall off in the process but that it wouldnt even matteri really like this portrayal of sansa sophie turner is doing a great job as are the writers despite the small character changesi love that they kept that battlement scene pretty much intact from the book its one of my favorite sansa moments when she looks at joffrey and says maybe my brother will bring me your head and yay sandor spoke more than 1 line still needs more hound or at least stop cutting all his scenesdragons awesome yoren awesome gendry yum emilia clarke kicks ass"

"Social Justice Bass",2011-06-20,"i just finished watching it and ill probably rewatch it again mostly because my hbo go was having issues so i watched it on the xfinity main website that was a mistake  it was constantly freezing on scenes something that ive never had happen over at hbos site it seems to have sorted itself out so ill give it another watch i likeddaeneryss emotion at the whole situation she genuinely came across as upset and distraught including with miri maz durz the witch woman the only thing that felt off to me was the witchs lack of emotion in the book shes genuinely angry and upset particularly in the description of how the previous three dothraki warriors raped her by mounting her like a dog mounts a bitch or something like that her line to daenerys about how life is when everything else is gone is a gutpunch that said she almost made up for it with her death where she transitioned from singing to screaming when the fire got her daeneryss ending and the dragons i was worried that the dragons would seem too cheesy but i think they did a good job with them i particularly loved how it ended with the dragon cries just like the final line in the book about how after hundreds of years the night was full with the music of dragons jons ending props to mormont who was great in his scenes the final shot of jon and mormonts narration was my favorite character arc ending in this episode all the scenes with robb and catelyn the best scene in the episode in my opinion was the scene where griefstricken cat embraces griefstricken robb i was almost tearyeyed myself sansas scenes sansa in the film is definitely an improvement on sansa in the books my third favorite scene was the instant when she almost pushes joffrey off the ledge but gets pulled back by the hound he then tells her save yourself a lot of pain or the like but you know hes not just talking about further beatings the spat between littlefinger and varys its always great to see westeross spiders fighting each other with veiled insults boasts and threats theon    theres not a lot i can say other than that its going to seem tragic i hope they do his storyline right tyrion was good with tywin as usual you can still tell that his father terrifies him but hes also pleased at getting his fathers praise and need poor arya shes got so much crap coming and she never gets home and yes shorthaired arya is a cute little kidi was pretty meh towardsjons scenes i really think the scene where he gets rounded up by his brothers was too short it wasnt helped by the fact that he did not seem that upset  he needs to be angry they murdered his father he is a bastard with no name no mother and now not even a father shae shes better than last episode but she still feels kind of off brans scenes i cant quite put my finger on it but the whole thing felt underwhelming maybe it was just the fact that rickon wasnt as upset or that we dont have as much of a connection with maester luwin hes close to bran in the books pycelles sexposition it was somewhat interesting to hear him talk about the kings hes served but still a rather slow sceneall in all a good ending to season one on to season two im particularly looking forward to it because its based on a clash of kings which is my favorite book in the entire series edited by wise bass 20 june 2011  0116 am"

"Anomandaris86",2011-06-20,"overall very good the dragons looked great not shitty at all my only qualm is the king in the north scene not so much the placement of it though that too but just how goddamn short it is they rushed through it as quickly as possible and didnt really go into details of the political situation in the books it was important because they discuss all their options and then the greatjon comes with this perfect idea out of left field i dont think the scene will have nearly the same effect for non readers because i doubt they can tell how momentous this occasion really isi also felt weird about the pycelle scene but then as i saw others point out its purpose here it made a little more sense also the jaimecat scene didnt really accomplish anything because at this point jaime isnt willing to divulge his incest whereas in the book catelyn has already heard the rumor and jaime admits to it so in this scene we get jaime admitting to shoving bran out the window but he wont tell why nothing about the assassin either theres no purpose to the scene other than maybe a little fan servive of seeing cat hit jaimeon the other hand loved the second varyslittlefinger scene especially where varys asks him if he sees the people who made fun of him bowing as hes on the throne and littlefinger says something like theyll have a hard time bowing without their heads this scene really drove forward how bitter he is more than the books ever did for me is that good or bad also that gave a good hint to non readers that littlefinger was the one who convinced joffrey to kill nedsimplifies the stuff in the vale i guess maybe lysas fall is going to be an accident or caused by another servant or something it doesnt really matter who the scapegoat isit has to be littlefinger killing her has toi cant even get upset about the pycelle scene that was hbos way of saying there wasnt any book material left we had to make up a scene i really liked it kind of a nice resolution type episode to whet appetites for next seasonyou mean preparing us for when we see him jump out of bed naked and piss himself unfortunately i doubt that would happen i dont think the actor would be willing to do that still through his robe there i believe i saw a bit of his junkanyone else surprised how much they adhered to the dragon scene i toltally expected them to cut out the nursing partthey didnt i didnt notice any nursing though as others pointed out there may have been a little though they obviously couldnt show two nursing and the other on her head as they needed one to cover her bush since she doesnt seem willing to show thatdont be theres a whole lot of people that cant get past quibbles and realize soeone with that much screen time has a purpose im surprised that no one has whined that the part of pycelle closing the door couldve been cut so they could show 2 seconds of something that happened offscreen in the books ill say it for the last time this season folks trust them theyve done an almost universally praised job of making a badass series out of badass books that is not easy whatsoever so show some faith ros and shae are there for a reason the impact of robbs wolf was made known a big complaint from last episode jaimes rep is being bolstered etc patience and faith trust me youll enjoy things even more if you drop the whining about the little shit you think could be used somewhere else its chess not checkersso since theyve done a lot of good things we cant criticize them for anything we have to take everything they give us on faith is that how it worksthe youve ruined your sword line was great in my opinion its just the sort of trivial thing thats said in the throes of grief i honestly dont remember if there was an analogous scene in the book but i prefer the line in the episode to a gushier more melodramatic oneagreedyes its marillion grrm misspoke or misremembered or they changed the details later  marillion has his tongue cut out but presumably will live thats the big change to a lesser character that he was thinking abouthbo go special features confirms it is marillion still he doesnt die until book 4 anywayso his statement was wrong on all levelsalright im curious to what theyll do for lysas murder remember that she had marillion in there to play over sansas screams and also a big reason why sansa was willing to go along with him being a scapegoat was because he tried to rape her littlefinger obviously knew this and planned accordingly i suppose they could just have another singer who does the exact same thing but it seems pretty pointless"

"Skillet",2011-06-20,"on another note i thought it was inspirational of the writers to remove marillions tongue one of the things that didnt ring true for me about the end of asos is that marillion would obviously have stated his side of the story even if no one would have believed him but in the books we are just given the explanation that littlefinger finds a way to keep him quiet sorry but if a murderer accused me of the murder he committed methinks i might say a word or two in my defense but now without a tongue that issue is solved well done"

"snowzombie",2011-06-20,"they managed to make it look like dany was breastfeeding  that is if you were looking for it the green dragon was in her lap and as she sat up he was not near her breast but the initial image gives that impression for me the dragon scene in the book got some of its power from dany being told she will never mother a child and then she hatches the dragons who become her children despite giving birth to a stillborn monster baby her body still had mothers milk to nourish new life it must be really difficult for women who have miscarried or given birth to stillborn children to still have the aching breasts but no baby to feed this scene is profound because dany is a woman it would not have the same impact if it were a man the writers made some interesting choices  for starters making mmds betrayal very clear drogo didnt die because he ripped off her poultice he died because she put some foul stuff on a fairly insignificant wound but im left wondering why dany wasnt told shed never have a child perhaps because grrm is going to write about dany having a child in the future and not only was the dragon scene powerful because she gave birth to new life after being told she wouldnt her destiny as a leader seemed precarious because she would never have an heir anyway im not here to bitch about any choices hbo made i think this stuff is interesting to consider in terms of what it might mean for her in the future its also interesting to think about how theyll keep robb and jamie in the mix next year despite them being offscreen for all of acok lastly sansa i liked her more in the books  she came across as naive on the show she was a bitchy mean girl but now it feels like she was played that way to make her arc more dramatic she went from being someone who didnt appreciate her family and aspired to become a baratheonlannister to realizing she took her family for granted she seemed like she had a weak character and not much integrity now she has to learn to be strong and remain true to herself while seeming to obey joffrey"

"aeoleron9",2011-06-20,"this episode sort of made up for last weeks disappointment the endings to various plotlines are all nicely done but i agree with the general opinion against the ros stuff its just sloppy writing if you wanna add stuff thats fine but at least put some effort into it its the same thing with the missing battles its fine to skip them for budget reasons but dont use the dumbest excuse like tyrion getting knocked out by his own guys so its back to waiting then looking forward to season two"

"Ferrum Aeternum",2011-06-20,"blown away for the 3rd week in a rowthe last three episodes of the season were the strongest imo although this one wasnt quite up to the level of the last two it was still a powerhouse and all the major scenes were appropriately moving and effectivegeneral comments the opening scene depicting the immediate aftermath of neds execution was great at conveying a sense of chaos and confusion from aryas point of view also a wise decision to carry yorens boy admonitions and hasty barber work over to this episode so as not to lessen the dramatic impact of the actual beheading very well done bran and osha make a great team im not in favor of cutting the reeds as has been speculated may be done since im a fan of both of them but i suppose if it has to be done showosha is as good a candidate as any to accompany bran north if they do that i still wonder what the hell becomes of rickon excellent convincing use of shaggy in the crypts he really did look like a mean little shit of a wolf king in the north was pitchperfect for my money the only change i would have made would be to delay this scene to 3rdttolast just before the nw marches north  speaking of which i liked all of the decisions to move material from acok into this episode particularly the nws movement north which was a flatout epic sequence for the first time i can remember all season the showrunners decided to go with a montagevoiceover which if done correctly as it was here can be a very effective means of storytelling the jaimecat scene was wellplayed and made a lot of sense though it begs the obvious question what the hell will jaime have to do next season now that his only significant scene from acok has been moved to season 1 dd apparently want to take things in a slightly different direction should be interesting to see exactly what that is  tyriontywin was superbly played these are two characters that continually feel as if they stepped straight out of the books and seeing them together is always a treat the stunted fool line accompanied by the patented tywin lookdownthenose was great stuff even better was tyrions understated response to that and his mixture of shock and redemption at being named hand the emmy buzz for dinklage is gaining strong momentum and i believe hell win it deservedly so the added scenes were ok more varyslf is always good and served as a nice reset to exactly where both of them stand at the moment good setup for whats to come  shockingly i didnt hate the rospycelle scenes content although i do feel that it absolutely killed the momentum of the episode which up until then had been steamrolling along the scene itself was actually kind of funny and also revealed a great deal about pycelles character that we dont find out until later on in the books ie what a bloody faking fraud he is i have to admit to giggling at his calisthentics and laughing out loud as he remembered to return to humped over old man mode before exiting his door for what its worth not very much actually it was my favorite ros scene of the season that said i really hope we see much less of her next year  the dragon hatching scene  just amazing emilia clarke has come so far since episode 1 where i didnt enjoy her performance that much the scene didnt play out exactly as it did in the books but it played out immensely well nonetheless her hair didnt burn off  which surprised me  but she is dany the unburnt after all i suppose it makes sense on some level that if her skin doesnt burn her hair doesnt either no matterthe reveal of the dragons made it all worthwhile capped off by drogons screams the huge epic musical crescendo and the fantastic final landscape shot what a way to bring a superb season of television to a closemy verdict was 910  points deducted only for grinding the momentum to a screeching halt with backtoback varyslf and pycelleros exposition scenes edited by ser helman tallhart 20 june 2011  0848 am"

"Kalbear",2011-06-20,"i was disappointed and going completely wtf at the rospycelle scene it just felt out of place and conveyed so little information while standing out yet again as sexposition theater it felt off especially compared to the other notes we get the king in the north we get cersei fucking yet another member of her family we get arya going north and escaping and we get maesterobics the hell i was a bit confused about the loss of the comet i realize the speech is all in her head at that point but the comet is important for a lot of other people too i was more confused by them deciding to all hang out overnight while dany burns what were they hoping to have a nice breakfast or something also losing her oaths from her bloodriders was sad the dragons were great bald dany would have been better i wanted the whole camp of the northmen to scream king in the north having the lords say it was okay though it sounded a bit understated but then panning back to the camp who hasno reaction at all that was sloppy all in all it didnt grab me as well as prior eps did sansa was absolutely perfect arya was great tyriontywin was spot on and completely lifted from the books word for word jon was fine if not a bit understated danys heartbreak was great but the dragon hatching just didnt feel epic enough for me a good but not great ending"
"The hairy bear",2011-06-20,"things i lovedthe episode starting just were we left last episodeall the scenes with jon snowall the scenes with sansa and joffreythings i hatedthe king in the north scene its one of my favourite scenes in the books and it felt weak here im not sure why perhaps it was hard to depict that the greatjons intervention came after hours of fruitless discussion perhaps its that i was missing cats thoughts perhaps is that it didnt felt a solemn moment but more like drunken cries around a campfire but imo its certainly on of the scenes with a lowest awesomness in the showawesomness in the books ratioshowing cersei with lancel now a mistake cersei does love jaime in her way and showing her with lancel while he learns of jaimes capture makes her too twisted a character i would have liked to see how devastated he was with the loss of his lover thats why he would turn to lancel at s2the final scene was badly staged imo the pyre was so small and the flames so tiny that you cant buy for a minute that all the camp went to sleep why daenerys didnt burn a few meters from them and no one noticed this young lady sitting among the ashes brrr and theres no way mormont would have allowed dany to enter the pyre as it was filmed the dragons looked great and the acting was fine but i found the whole sequence badly staged"

"Mad Sweeney",2011-06-20,"on another note i thought it was inspirational of the writers to remove marillions tongue one of the things that didnt ring true for me about the end of asos is that marillion would obviously have stated his side of the story even if no one would have believed him but in the books we are just given the explanation that littlefinger finds a way to keep him quiet sorry but if a murderer accused me of the murder he committed methinks i might say a word or two in my defense but now without a tongue that issue is solved well donewhat if the murderer who has complete and total power over everything now with no due process or innocent until proven guilty what if that murderer told you that if you fight it and blab then youll still die but well do it slowly and with hot pincers or you could keep quiet and youll get a quick relatively painless death either way youre going to die would you still speak up"
"Mad Sweeney",2011-06-20,"overall very good the dragons looked great not shitty at all my only qualm is the king in the north scene not so much the placement of it though that too but just how goddamn short it is they rushed through it as quickly as possible and didnt really go into details of the political situation in the books it was important because they discuss all their options and then the greatjon comes with this perfect idea out of left field i dont think the scene will have nearly the same effect for non readers because i doubt they can tell how momentous this occasion really isi also felt weird about the pycelle scene but then as i saw others point out its purpose here it made a little more sense also the jaimecat scene didnt really accomplish anything because at this point jaime isnt willing to divulge his incest whereas in the book catelyn has already heard the rumor and jaime admits to it so in this scene we get jaime admitting to shoving bran out the window but he wont tell why nothing about the assassin either theres no purpose to the scene other than maybe a little fan servive of seeing cat hit jaimeon the other hand loved the second varyslittlefinger scene especially where varys asks him if he sees the people who made fun of him bowing as hes on the throne and littlefinger says something like theyll have a hard time bowing without their heads this scene really drove forward how bitter he is more than the books ever did for me is that good or bad also that gave a good hint to non readers that littlefinger was the one who convinced joffrey to kill nedit has to be littlefinger killing her has toyou mean preparing us for when we see him jump out of bed naked and piss himself unfortunately i doubt that would happen i dont think the actor would be willing to do that still through his robe there i believe i saw a bit of his junkthey didnt i didnt notice any nursing though as others pointed out there may have been a little though they obviously couldnt show two nursing and the other on her head as they needed one to cover her bush since she doesnt seem willing to show thatso since theyve done a lot of good things we cant criticize them for anything we have to take everything they give us on faith is that how it worksagreedhbo go special features confirms it is marillion still he doesnt die until book 4 anywayso his statement was wrong on all levelsalright im curious to what theyll do for lysas murder remember that she had marillion in there to play over sansas screams and also a big reason why sansa was willing to go along with him being a scapegoat was because he tried to rape her littlefinger obviously knew this and planned accordingly i suppose they could just have another singer who does the exact same thing but it seems pretty pointlessdidnt say you couldnt criticize them just poking at the people who are going apoplectic about trivial little things because theyre different from the books its more of a you shouldnt complain so much about stupid little things admonition than a you cant complain about stupid little things because it comes off as childish unappreciative and many times downright arrogant i think they proved beyond a doubt that there are good reasons for all the choices theyve made so basically chill out because you not you specifically but the wailing masses sound silly"

"Mad Sweeney",2011-06-20,"totally agree with this hopefully they crank up the cgi for the direwolves too i hope they concentrate more on the ranging in season 2 since they dont have much to show on danys side of things stannis renly tyrion the old bear and jon theon will probably be the focus next season i dont have much hope for renly but hopefully the others give some powerful performances its funny to see that robb was just aimlessly hacking at tree bark after the rife speculation of the past week still think it would have been better to make jaime light by a hand sophie turner is unfortunate in that shes playing a character openly reviled by book readers and i dont think her acting is endearing her to tv viewers either feel sorry for her i actually prefer ros to shae ros is more attractive and can act better but its a shame all shes given are sexposition scenes would have been better to have her take shaes place it would be just typical of martin to have pycelle outwit lf and varys in the end i dont know if his acting stooped is a touch by the directors or some private info shared by martin danys ending scene was well done although it would have been better to transition immediately from the flames to the dragons but im not complaining its still a 1010 episode and an improvement over episode 8 and 9perhaps this will change in upcoming seasons for one grrm has said shes well liked and her role will be expanded a bit though that doesnt necessarily mean she wont be outside of sexposition scenes but her character is extremely well placed to take the place of many different characters or events shes most likely a varys spy and most likely a lf spy as well with undetermined loyalty with the expanded bromantic rivalry between varys realm first and lf me first it could lead to some great storylinesevents"

"Easy",2011-06-20,"4 tyriontywin stuff was good but shae still gets on my nerves she is far too assertive imo at this point i realize that theyre just changing her character but i dont really get why ah well not terribly importanttheyre trying to show her feisty assertiveness as the trait that makes tyrion like shae which doesnt work well imo and nowhere near as well as the feisty wittiness she displays in the book we all know thats what really attracts tyrion to herthey should have kept that its not that hard to do on screen there have plenty of comedy romances where the female lead is similar to shae in the booksvery very minor gripe let not it detract from the awesomeness of this show"

"The Knight of Grasses",2011-06-20,"okay i have one nitpick were allowed those once in a while right when tyrion said that his father was the richest man in the whole country i cringed it just sounded so out of place to hear of westeros the seven kingdoms be referred to as a country perhaps i was the only one bothered by it but it was like nails on a chalkboard for me that is the one problem i have with the episode which means it was as close to perfection as possiblei have to say i noticed it as well it wasnt quite nailsonachalkboard for me but it definitely felt out of place i rationalized it by telling myself that country doesnt necessarily mean a nationstate like we use it today but can simply mean a large area of land i think it can work with that meaning although it still seemed an odd choice of words"

"Mad Sweeney",2011-06-20,"but balon had dictated that the starks were the enemy once your liege lord has declared an enemy you fight them as best you can taking winterfell was a brilliant stroke of tactics of course it was followed up by the incredible foolishness of letting rickon and bran escape and trying to hold the castle had theon taken the boys immediately for pyke as asha points out hed have been a hero to his people and earned the respect of his father instead he got what he gotthere is a line in a somewhat cheesy old movie i think it is they died with their boots on a soldier who disobeys orders earns either a courtmartial or a medal theon disregarded balons orders but i dont think balon would have objected to his son taking winterfell trying to hold it was stupid but the taking itself was inspired soldieringi disagree with you entirely his liege lord declared the starks enemies but he also decreed theon was to do other things that theon then ignored i dont recall but didnt the fact that theons group wasnt where it was supposed to be become a problem for other raiding groups considering the fact that balon said he didnt want winterfell i fail to see how he would be happy about it period much less at the cost of the plans and direct orders he made for theons and ashas groups taking something you cant hold isnt brilliant tactics or strategy its foolish and rash and was entirely of theons doing which was the point i was arguing overall here someone was mitigating theons actions in turning against robb he got what he got because it was stupid for him to do it in the first place and balon knew it and thats why he had theon doing other things"
"Mad Sweeney",2011-06-20,"guess well disagree i see it as a betrayal of robb as much as ambition poorly directed but thats another story and anger he cant be loyal to everyone in the situation hes in and hes tired of being kicked around so he lashes out and does something destructive and status gaining which is exactly what he needs there i dont see a child who lashes out on his parents as being disloyal but merely expressing his angernot that any of this makes him a better person in my eyes as i said he is a shit and a horrible personi dont see how you can equate what theon did with a child lashing out against his parents unless by lashing out you mean a child savagely murdering the parents families and friends as well as a few others that are intended to make the parents think even more of their loved ones are dead so other than murder on a mass scale yeah its exactly like a child lashing outlmaogif classbbcemoticon altlmao theon flat out betrayed robb no other way around it and i cant see for the life of me how it could be viewed any other way"

"The Knight of Grasses",2011-06-20,"i dont see how you can equate what theon did with a child lashing out against his parents unless by lashing out you mean a child savagely murdering the parents families and friends as well as a few others that are intended to make the parents think even more of their loved ones are dead so other than murder on a mass scale yeah its exactly like a child lashing outlmaogif classbbcemoticon altlmao theon flat out betrayed robb no other way around it and i cant see for the life of me how it could be viewed any other wayim with you here i understand the argument that theon is a soldier following orders except you know that hes not really hes been given charge of a raiding party he has not been instructed to take winterfell as hard as it would have been he could have made choices that would have honored his allegiance to robb thats not even that hard to fathom given the fact that he doesnt appear to mind disobeying his fathers orders of course when he does disobey his father its to completely betray the starks if theon had simply followed balons instructions i could see the argument that hes just a soldier but his actions indicate otherwise"

"The Knight of Grasses",2011-06-20,"reactions to some comments  i loved the king in the north scene could it have been longer yeah i wouldnt have minded that could it have been positioned differently within the episode probably but the scene taken by itself was definitely one of my favorites for the entire season at one point i was tempted to get up and grab my replica anduril just so i could kneel and shout king in the north i got chills during that scene  i agree with some who thought mmd was a bit understated in her dialogue with dany it was unclear why she stuck around in the first place although the assumed reason is that she simply has nowhere else to go in the middle of the plains but id expect a confession like that would carry more emotion  i dont understand the confusion over the dothraki sticking around after the pyre where the heck are they going to go its probably late afternoon or evening when the whole thing goes down are they going to pack up and leave right then only to make camp in an hour or two the ones who stuck around are either fiercely loyal to dany or were too oldsickweak to do anything without the ones who were fiercely loyal to dany it makes sense that they would honor her by staying at least for the night  i understand the point of the pycelleroz scene but im not a huge fan of sexposition in general its another of those scenes that i accept but would have liked to see the time spent on other things  the one scene that felt really rushed and just thrown in there was the cerseilancel scene again i dont mind its inclusion but it seemed a bit out of place and might be confusing to nonreaders i know my wife had questions about it  she didnt realize it was lancel at first  everything else was fantastic  aryaarry jons night ride the muster for the great ranging varyslf cat and jaime cat and robbi got chills quite a few times this episode"

"Asha<U+0097>Not Yara!",2011-06-20,"making her have a foreign background was obviously done because they cast a german actress for her and they needed to explain her accent i dont know if theyre going to expand on her background or not later on which is why im intrigued by it depending on how they do it it could be very interesting but if they dont delve into it deeply i wont be particularly bothered either though id be surprised if we dont learn a bit more edited by mellisandra 20 june 2011  0110 pm"

"Mad Sweeney",2011-06-20,"things i loved1 sansas inner monologue from the book being shown more assertively on screen joffrey being a monster excellent scene all around thought it had an even stronger impact in the show than in the book and ive always been a sansa fan very convincing that sansa is starting to be able to internalize her feelings 2 tywin  i totally believe that hes a man who intimidates his sons and makes them crave his approval 3 dany walking into the flames  was worried that this would seem cheesy but even knowing what was going to happen it felt like there was real danger 4 mormont is a much better commander than jon deserves while i understand the importance of the dragons and why that should be both the season and book end i kind of wish that the last shot of the show was the nights watch riding out of the gate  a neat parallel to the beginning of the show5 gendry wubgif classbbcemoticon altwub  also loved that yorens admonitions to arya translated well from the book  not a smart boy that what you mean to say they combined it with the first arya chapter in acok but there arya beats up hot pie badly and yoren physically disciplines her i suspect that showing that would be an unnecessary way to make a lot of viewers hate yoren things that were alright1 branosharickon im not at all a fan of oshas casting seeing shaggydog was cool but rickon still feels kind of random even though ive read the books i still keep forgetting about him in the show i wonder if he will ever have a major part in the books  without the five year aging up and with the series already being over halfway through while he could be a catalyst its hard to imagine him becoming an interesting personality on his own2 cerseilancel not sure about the choice to put this into the last episode of the season where it has little context might have had more impact to introduce it in parallel with jaime revealing that cersei is the only woman he ever loved and all his life choices were to stay close to her 3 king of the north i liked it but didnt love it in fact i like both robb and catelyn better in the show than the book but robb was never a character who i truly loved and rooted for even on my first read i wasnt all emotional the first time i read the red wedding likewise in the show i didnt care about robb enough to get too excited although the scene was well executed and i have no complaints regarding the show4 pycelle and ros i was pretty neutral on this  a lot depends on what is revealed later since pycelle is still around at the end of book 4 it makes sense to build up his character a little more if ros is shown to be a spy for varys explicitly commanded by him to come down to kl once ned had gone it will redeem a lot of the silliness that she just happens to sleep with every important man in the plot the only scene that will still not work for me in any way shape or form is the littlefinger sexposition thats still just wrong no matter what else is revealed things that didnt work for meok seriously you know whats a million times more annoying than people discussing what honestly didnt work for them people who seem to post here only to complain about the complainers ungrateful arrogant what are you the show morality police finding out what people like and dont like and why things do or dont work for them makes for interesting discussions posting one liners about how haters should shut up contributes exactly nothing 1 shae i hate shae again its not because shes not exactly like book shae although i do think that book shae was better in revealing tyrions vulnerabilities and his inability to get past tysha and his desire to sink back into a fantasy the actress and her mannerisms are just incredibly grating to me for whatever reason more so than anyone else on the show 2 the gap between when dany walks into the fire and how everyone falls asleep while shes supposedly burning maybe for people who didnt know what was going to happen the delay was a moment of great tension and build up but imo it was kind of an odd dead spot3 jons friends are too good for him its not the shows fault the deserting scene was well executed but jon does not work for me and it grinds my gears to see everything just fall into place for him all the time i hope he falls off the wallas ive said before commenting on what does and doesnt work for you isnt what i was railing against its the doom and gloom massive whiners that think 20 seconds of x would be better served showing something else there are only a few posters that really fit in there and besides i could turn around and say the same thing about my posts who are you to decide what i can and cant complain about in regards to posts what are you the posting morality police and since youve driected that at me ill add that i post far more than just commentary on the naysayers"

"DuckEverlasting",2011-06-20,"i think the show is doing a great job of setting theon up as more than a turncoat asshat in my opinion hes one of the most tragic characters in the series he was brought up half ironborn and half northerner and in the end hes a little too much of both to be accepted by either the ironborn see him as too soft and the northerners see him as too cruel all he really wants is feel like he belongs somewhere and to be treated with the respect he thinks he deserves as many of you have already pointed out his major flaw however is that he has way too high an opinion of himself and his slight persecution complex combined with his actual persecution means that he always thinks life will be better on the other side of the fence his place at robbs side where he stands right now is the home hes always wanted and the happiest hell ever be but hes too blind to see it until its way too late tragic sorry if this is a bit much i just got through a reread of cok and this has been bouncing around in my head lately loved the episode btw"

"Unnamed",2011-06-20,"reflecting on the whole season i think we should all be thrilled with the job hbo  co have done of bringing the story to life if nothing else i think theyve stayed very true to the spirit of the story much more so than experience had taught me to expectwhich is not to say that everything has been perfect however of the various things being batted about there are a couple points that i feel i have something to add tofirst with regard to mirridani im quoting from a post for ep 9 which i probly posted too late for most to see it because i am interested in feedbackive noticed that no one seems to have the same theory on the mirridani thing that i do based onmirris comments before the blood magic sceneif jorah had not carried dani into the tent the baby would have been fine that is this is what i believethe stillborn fetus is described as being somewhat dragonlikei always thought that mirri knew that drogo would live in a vegetative state although it doesnt make sense to me unless he was already dead and that the horses life was used to power this it also seemed that jorah carrying dany into the tent was a critical mistake if it did not matter why make a point of having it play out that waybut heres my key point theres every reason to believe that dani had a live normal baby in her belly until she was carried into the tent then gave birth to some reptilian thing then she is able to hatch fossilized dragon eggs i always believed that the horse paid for drogos life but the baby paid for the dragon eggs coming to life they were in the tent and i assumed that they were able to suck the life out of danis baby as an unintended side effect of mirris blood magic if not what else explains the miraculous births of the 3 dragons or the strange deformities of the fetusfor what its worth i never felt that mirri was plotting drogorhaegos deaths from the beginning i always read her response to dani as an afterthefact justification along the lines of well its a shame it didnt work out but i really dont care i never really liked your husband or your baby anyway also when shes saying dani knew the price i dont think she meant the stillbirthi think she meant that dani knew that drogo would not be fully aliveafter watching the last show i now also wonder if mirris life also was necessary as part of the price for bringing the dragons back but i still think that jorah carrying dani into the tent where there were dragon eggs and dancing dead was the critical event that altered world historyanyone else see it that way in particular anyone else agree that danis babys life was spent animating dragons not drogosecond i find that i side with the people who hate the changes to shaes character not because i dont find her sexy i dont but because i dont see how this character could possible arouse any real emotion in tyriontheyve made her seem mysterious and complex which would make her just like all the people that tyrion is surrounded by seriously can anyone think that this character doesnt have enough to think about or that he is looking for yetanotherperson in his life who requires careful parsing of every utterance for hidden nuancesthe key point in tyrions character development is the tysha story she was not a whore or didnt seem to be nor was she some complicated foreigner with untold secrets she was a simple young traumatized girl who charmed him with her basic sweetnesstyrion never forgets that shae is a whore but he gets emotionally attached to her because of her similarities to tysha this new shae is nothing like tysha and points it out in her first scene leaving no narrative explanation for any attachment he might form to her in every other case this character instinctively dislikes schemers and plotters and instinctively likes more simple straightforward characters look at who he bonds with and who he doesntso my point is whether shae is generally sexy is almost immaterial the fact is the character theyve painter her to be is the antithesis of tyrions perfect woman tysha and could not be more incompatible with him as a love interest and because of this every scene where they are together is absolutely like nails on a chalkboard for comparison the pycelle scene was more like snails on a chalkboardof course this is more than made up for by the spoton portrayals of other characters arya tyrion the list goes on and on i still think catelyn is the wicked witch of the north but she doesnt throw the entire chemistry off the way shae doesi just cant figure out why ned and littlefinger carry such strong love for the perpetually scowling womanfor me overall the series has been like a wonderfully arranged piece of music with shae being the one ringing false note that i keep struggling to shake out of my head then again id probably have sat through several hours of complete crap just to see dani with her dragonsi am absolutely interested in feedback on the arguable points here particularly from those that have given the books a far closer reading than i havevm"

"Mad Sweeney",2011-06-20,"unnamed imo there is no doubt whatsoever from the books or the glance to danys belly in the show that the price for drogos life is the baby iirc miri tells dany that she knew the price and i dont see how a horses life would be a good blood sacrifice for the life of a powerful man i think thats what makes blood magic somewhat taboo as it involves human blood the horse was just a ruse i also believe that mmd knew exactly what she was doing from the moment she stepped forward obviously she couldnt have know exactly what would happen but theres no doubt that she caused the wound to be as bad as it became and she knew or made happen that drogo would be a veg when she kept him alive i really dont think it makes sense to believe otherwise her village was slaughtered she was repeatedly raped and was looking at being a slave for life does it make any sense whatsoever to earnestly try to help the leader of the rapersreavers nope she had a chance to kill the khal that destroyed her life and she took it then she had the chance to cause even more havoc and she took it but again there seems to be little doubt whatsoever that the price of drogos life was rhaego she went into labor right as the spell began as to why it was deformed i dont believe it wouldve been deformed like that if mmd hadnt intervened the bloodmagic transformed it while killing it i dont recall the phrophecies or if the book mentioned anything but the dragons hatching seems to be necessary for the prophecy to be fulfilled her being the last dragontargaeryan had more to do with them hatching than the bloodmagic sacrifice obviously with her surviving the flames more is going on than drogo and mmd burning and danys ascension to fulfill her destiny begins"

"Raksha the Demon",2011-06-20,"it is not the minor change in the character that matters so much it is the longterm effects on the development of the series that it will have im ok with cerseis momentous display of empathy for branim ok with catelyns singular display of senseless violence against jaimeim ok with tyrions overstated desire for whores and drinking as seen in the pilot episodebut pycelle is a different case entirely the fact that he is shown to keep up a mask for in front of the court is of much greater relevance to how the series will progress and is completely disharmonious with the booksim actually not okay with cerseis supposed empathy for bran i didnt believe it cersei doesnt give a damn about other peoples children unless they are valuable to her own or to her maybe she was trying to verbally disarm catelyn and i had a real problem with cersei saying shed had a blackhaired son who had died as an infant we know that she never had any blackhaired children of roberts only jaimes blond children in later novels cersei reveals pride in her own consuming of roberts sperm off her fingers she speaks of eating roberts children and she has also said that she got aborted the pregnancies that robert managed to give her  the level of hate and resentment that would inspire a woman in cerseis position to take these measures is tremendous and very much a part of cerseis character but in the tv series cersei did not hate robert that much she appears to borne at least one child to him i doubt she would lie about that to catelyn since it would be known that the queen had one child who did not survive and the tv writers seem to imply that the child was roberts else why would cersei have even mentioned the infants hair color unless the infant was really another of jaimes blond bastards and cersei lied possible but this was something that catelyn could have found out with some searching cerseis revelations puzzled me and made no sense given what we know of her character unless one accepts as i probably have to that tvcersei is a rather different character than bookcersei"

"Mad Sweeney",2011-06-20,"im actually not okay with cerseis supposed empathy for bran i didnt believe it cersei doesnt give a damn about other peoples children unless they are valuable to her own or to her maybe she was trying to verbally disarm catelyn and i had a real problem with cersei saying shed had a blackhaired son who had died as an infant we know that she never had any blackhaired children of roberts only jaimes blond children in later novels cersei reveals pride in her own consuming of roberts sperm off her fingers she speaks of eating roberts children and she has also said that she got aborted the pregnancies that robert managed to give her  the level of hate and resentment that would inspire a woman in cerseis position to take these measures is tremendous and very much a part of cerseis character but in the tv series cersei did not hate robert that much she appears to borne at least one child to him i doubt she would lie about that to catelyn since it would be known that the queen had one child who did not survive and the tv writers seem to imply that the child was roberts else why would cersei have even mentioned the infants hair color unless the infant was really another of jaimes blond bastards and cersei lied possible but this was something that catelyn could have found out with some searching cerseis revelations puzzled me and made no sense given what we know of her character unless one accepts as i probably have to that tvcersei is a rather different character than bookcerseishowing that roberts offspring coupled with jon arryns dying words the seed is strong is the onl reason for that scene it was their way of showing what the blonde hair of joffrey implies"
"Mad Sweeney",2011-06-20,"i guess it all depends on what people think tyrion would or should fall for its almost unbelievable to me that he would fall for show shae as has been mentioned hes surrounded by hard to get people who all want to use him and tyrion desperately wants to be appreciated to the point that he acts irrationally not just with shae but with his father and the entire court he thinks its pathetic how grateful he is when ser garlan praises him for his part in the battle but he just cant help himself moreover show shae doesnt seem to admire him in any way i cant imagine her calling him my giant of lannister without irony in her voice if shes going to pretend to fall for him why start out so abrasive surely there are clients she could pull in that way but just as many who will kick her out the door  and as for not being a cheap camp follower who would be glad to get a knight or lordling bronn took her from a knight a few tents down she wasnt exactly in a chatayalike establishment it would be pretty strange if some random knight had a high born courtesan if she really does start to fall for him imo it makes her more a villain for her betrayal theres something incredibly more repulsive about a woman who sells the man she genuinely cares about for the promise of a manse and a marriage to a knight than there is about book shae who was always a whore i think that theres a more sympathetic although not entirely innocent story from book shaes perspective if the pov were from the perspective of a low born uneducated whore who knows that her client participated in the gang rape of his first wife and gets more and more disgusted with having not just to fuck the guy but put on an elaborate pretense of love and admiration until under threats and promises from the queen she testifies against him falsely that character is one who i think deserves as much pity as hatred she was always in above her head not everyone has to be a skilled playerall i can say is wait and see those are my thoughts on why the shaes are different however if you were a dwarf and paid for women constantly and were a smart and intellectual fellow what would intrigue you more just another in a constant stream of whores saying the same things showing the same affection and all motivated by money or a whore who seems to not care so much about the money who challenges the jon with a feisty attitude and who had a different path to whoredom than the typical whore as shown in the game they played in ep 9 we know tyrion is smarter and more well read than most people in the country so appealing to his intellectual side with mystery seems to be the route theyre going"

"Mad Sweeney",2011-06-20,"well i certainly cant point to anything in the book that refutes your pointsits not like grrm explains why things happen however we definitely have read it differentlyand i suspect it pleases grrm to no endone thing im curious about which i dont think you mentioned was the significance of jorah carrying dani into the tent the way the scene played out it seemed that her entering the tent was a big damn deal in both the book and the tv show in your reading of this whats your interpretation of this event that is what would have happened if she had remained outside or does it matter to my reading if she had stayed outside drogo would still have been a vegetable but her baby wouldnt have been a dead lizard and the dragon eggs would have been rocksof course one thing thats hard for me to reconcile is danis perception of the eggs being alive before all this since only she perceived it ive always felt that these were basically premonitionsthat is they were just rocks but she was picking up on the potential for them to be reanimatedwith plot points like this it fascinates me how different people can read the same events and interpret them so completely differentlyvmher baby might not be a dead lizard but it would be dead i dont think the eggs hatching have anything to do with mmds blood magic spell however the trauma that dany goes through during mmds revenge might be an emotionalsupernatural trigger for the eggs to hatch and maybe she needed to burn as well to activate the eggs and that would easily explain her empathy with the eggs"

"Lupigis",2011-06-21,"to summarize several pages of threads  many people think that the exotic mysterious and complex aspect is wrong for the character and the change in her character changes tyrions motivations for stupidly in both cases falling in love with her which changes the kind of person that tyrion is those who like her generally think either that shes enough of a minor character that the changes are essentially unimportant or think that shes gives tyrions attraction a more realistic focus since a smart person like tyrion might prefer a smart companionmostly i just find her annoying on a gut level i could never listen to her blather at me all day and since i like tyrion so much and otherwise want to spend a lot of screen time with him theyre the tv equivalent of the good friend with the really annoying girlfriendthis was a good summary of the issues i have with shae she is obviously a completely different person in the tv series vs the books and that difference will affect tyrions characterisation possibly by a whole lotshae only needs to appear as a whore to capture her essencefrankly this only goes to show that you dont understand the essence of shae and her relationship with tyrion wery well read eponines post again edited by lupigis 21 june 2011  0305 am"

"Lupigis",2011-06-21,"its funny how people are annoyed at an evil and totally unrealistic and exaggerated imo character is being portrayed as an actual human being because honestly it would be impossible to commit an attrocity like screwing over tyrion for money that is not a fair summary of the issues people have with tv shae both tv and book shae are portrayed as actual human beings but book shae is naive and dependent on tyrion while tv shae is experienced and appear to be much more independent which type of woman tyrion falls for affects the way we percieve himnor is it a correct description of what book shae does her lack of experience naivety and dependence on tyrion makes it easy to interpret the fact that she testifies against him as an act that she is forced to do because of outright threats andor desperationwith a stronger more experienced and independent tv shae how will that testimony and tyrions reaction to it play out i have no idea but im worried that hbo will take the easy way out and turn tv shae into someone who actively betrays tyrion as a free choice that would make his murder of her an act that would be much easier to justify for thos who want to idolise tyrion that would be a shame imo because the murder of book shae is a turning point for tyrion that is even more important than his subsequent murder of tywinthe above is just my speculation in two years time or so well know and in the meanwhile we can all hope that im wrong"

"Tall Tyrion Lannister!",2011-06-14,"whats really surprising to me isnt the nonreaders reaction to neds death but the fierce loyalty to drogo of all characters the otakuassemble guy said hell tune in for episode 10 but is done with the series if drogo dies wtf hes probably just hamming it up a bit for the camera but still maybe they made drogo too likeable in the show or something hopefully danys big finale will center the attention back to her on that continentas far as the lack of timefilling events for this episode i disagree heres what well likely get no particular orderdragons duhking in the northjons escape return and the start of the rangingarya yoren and the rest heading out of kljoff tormenting sansatyrion with shae and then with his father getting sent to klbrans last dreamcat talking with jaime apparently moved from book 2 to now insteadwill she possibly release him a season earlyand theres room there for some hboscreated scenes but i think whats there is plenty several of these are extremely pivotal moments in the entire series and theyll have some room to breathe and let us take in the emotions of everythingi doubt that cat would release him a season early she hasnt met brienne yet and she plays a big role jaimes turn around i know theyve done some softening of his charector but i think she still needs to be with him when hes set free"

"Lokhtar",2011-06-14,"i still dont like that the showed the king in the north that was a very major end of the first book but anyway what can we do hopefully they will show a lot of renly and stannis in preparation for season 2 perhaps just to give full focus to the war of the five kings and show who the major players are also i cant wait to see those dragonsi wonder it would definitely have to be someone who is not very importantthe actor who plays renly has said there is no more of his character for the rest of his season"
"Lokhtar",2011-06-14,"if the viewers dont stick around then so be it it just validates the cowardice formulaic tv that people put out because they can say that people actually dont want a real story despite them supposedly clamoring for it its like how everyone wants a smaller government but no one actually wants to cut any programs err just using that as an example dont want to get into politics id rather the show be canceled than go the route of true blood though thats not going to happen im pretty sure"

"lady_dondarrion",2011-06-16,"i like the idea of stannis in the last episode maybe end with dany credits then boom teaser for next season with stannis all broody and teethgrindy oh yeahrobb chopping jaimes hand off is just about the most ridiculous thing ive heard in a while thats not even just a nerd rage thing but a genuine wtf if they did that even id be pissed and i pretty much love everything hbo have done with the show so farthe ending with dany and her dragons would be the most dramatic not to mention it is faithful to the book smilegif classbbcemoticon alt yes i also believe that hbo wont stray to far"

"JakePT",2011-06-16,"i figured he was just hitting an inanimate object in a fit of rage i assumed mago was the character who died early even though he didnt die at all in the books and there was just a bit of a miscommunication or forgetfulness on him ding on book 3"

"SerArthurHeath",2011-06-16,"yesterday watching this preview i found a suspicion that made me to register here hello all and sorry for my englishso i am probably wrong but1 robb is shown chopping something too small move for execution too calm for a fight but probably important moment2 a character that dies later in the books should die this season3 hbo knew how much whining and anger they will face with neds death and they knew that there will be many nonreaders that will barely stay with the series but want revenge and blood lannister bloodso robb is cutting off jaimies hand kingslayer is dead as a character  not person  about two seasons fasterif ill be right i will have to start play poker again pthere is pretty much nothing that would stop me tuning in to season two of this great series this would though thats a huge change and not a good one and if they cut off jaimes hand sansa would be realistically in huge trouble"

"The Scabbard Of the Morning",2011-06-16,"actually robb doing it wouldnt be that big a change jaime rotting in a dungeon missing a hand is really not all that different from jaime losing it soon after he gets out and they could justify it by having jaime confess to pushing bran like he did in the scene with catelyn so the cutting of the hand is his punishment to trying to kill a child because they have to keep him alive as hostage the only difference is that it makes robb a much harsher character it also makes catelyn move later less bad releasing a maimed jaime is not nearly as bad as releasing a healthy jaime it will also make the jaime lannister sends his regards scene having more impact i actually wouldnt mind this change edited by the scabbard of the morning 16 june 2011  1249 pm"
"D_Richard",2011-06-16,"i wouldnt mind eitherd  d are going to need to rework some things that bigger than a hair color or factoid here and a fresh conversation there and this would simplify and possibly speed up brienne and jaimes relationshipnot that i think jaimes hand is for sure what robb is hacking at but it would reassure to me that dd know what theyre doing in terms of actually adapting the novels"
"Arrogant Bastard",2011-06-16,"update the more i think about it the less likely it seems though id still find it a pretty bold move we know theyve cast lord karstark as a featured extra this season and he hasnt shown up yet my guess is karstark attempts to kill jaime in the next episode and robb executes him for itdid they cast karstark as a featured extra i havent heard that and he isnt on the cast list at winter is comingnet also it would be way too early for robb to execute karstark especially only for an attempt to kill jaime him executing one of his banner lords this episode would greatly detract from the king in the north scene which will surely be the last scene of robbs this season i think the minor character who dies in book 3 or 4 that is killed this season has already gone it was either marillon or mago marillon was hit by a stone in episode 5 during the hill tribe attack and is never seen again so he could be the death"
"OhDanyBoy",2011-06-16,"did they cast karstark as a featured extra i havent heard that and he isnt on the cast list at winter is comingnet also it would be way too early for robb to execute karstark especially only for an attempt to kill jaime him executing one of his banner lords this episode would greatly detract from the king in the north scene which will surely be the last scene of robbs this season i think the minor character who dies in book 3 or 4 that is killed this season has already gone it was either marillon or mago marillon was hit by a stone in episode 5 during the hill tribe attack and is never seen again so he could be the deathmago doesnt die in book 3 or 4 marillion doesnt either and also has been confirmed as still being alive by bryan cogman the script supervisor for the show seems we still havent seen this mystery death or the information about it got mangled"

"Amir Mishali",2011-06-16,"gods ive been saying this for weeks now but no one seems to pay much attention none of the suggestions for the mystery character make much sense because for them to get rid of one of the characters that die in the third book they would need a very good reason we already know they were having lots of problems with the direwolves and next season they are going to be a budgetary burden because of the necessary cgi the solution to this problem is simple get rid of some of the direwolves the only direwolf that is absolutely necessary to the story is summer even ghost is expendable to a degree greywind he does nothing in the books iirc until the red wedding so they kill him earlier big deal this way theyre saving lots of money the only male character that actually makes sense in that regard then is greywind"
"The Scabbard Of the Morning",2011-06-16,"i disagree i think its a huge change that would cause a lot of character and plot problems down the line first it seems out of character for robb to maim jaime if robb took off a hand from jaime wouldnt he be afraid the lannisters would do the same to sansa word would probably spread back to kl second when jaime loses his hand is when his character changes because he no longer is the great fighter he once was and must rely on other qualities this would be harder to show while hes just rotting in a dungeon plus it removes brienne from the picture who plays a huge part in motivating jaime after his hand is lost i think it would make the jaime lannister sends his regards have less impact as it would seem more like the rw was devised just to get back at robb for cutting off jaimes hand also i think its too early for jaime to admit he pushed bran out of the window if he does he has to explain why he did which would then reveal to catelyn and presumably robb that he is the father of joffrey with that in mind i just dont think robb would proclaim himself king if he knew joffrey was the product of incest instead robb would most likely ally with stannis as the true heir as ned would have done plus in the book cat asks jaime about joffrey being his son because she heard it from stannis here its too early for her to know that unless in the show she deduces that jaime and cersei were screwing from that blonde hair she found in episode 2 which would be really sillywell  in the episode summary for chapter 10 i have found the following as tragic news spreads across the seven kingdoms bran and rickon share a prophetic dream catelyn interrogates jaime about her sones fall and robbes destiny is forever changed after a surprising decision by his father tyrion heads south arya assumes a new identity in an attempt to escape kinges landing and sansa is terrorized by joffrey so clearly we will get the jaime confessing scene in acok herewhich leads to if they are cutting his hand off for his confessed crime to trying to kill bran thats a legitimate punishment for a true crime whereas sansa has not been accused of anything ned was killed for confessed treason so they dont have to worry about lannisters harming sansa for simple revenge even the lannisters still have to keep up with appearances of justice and would need to cause to punish sansasecondly i dont agree with the interpretation that losing his hand is what started jaime on his journey of redemption yes its part of it but ive always understood that it was briennes commitment to honor and to her vows that is the catalyst for jaimes change he knew that brienne detested him and all that he was kingslayer child murderer incestadulterytreason against his king etc yet was still willing to risk her life to see him reach kings landing safely because she had pledged to do so that its not about whether you like the things that your vows make you do its about keeping your word so i dont think losing his hand now has much of an impact on jaimes redemption arc its was brienne not his lost hand"
"Arrogant Bastard",2011-06-16,"well  in the episode summary for chapter 10 i have found the following as tragic news spreads across the seven kingdoms bran and rickon share a prophetic dream catelyn interrogates jaime about her sones fall and robbes destiny is forever changed after a surprising decision by his father tyrion heads south arya assumes a new identity in an attempt to escape kinges landing and sansa is terrorized by joffrey so clearly we will get the jaime confessing scene in acok herenot necessarily she could interrogate him but he might not reveal everything why would he this early they could have moved up his story about the mad king killing brandon youre probably right that he will confess about bran and joffrey but i hope its not the casewhich leads to if they are cutting his hand off for his confessed crime to trying to kill bran thats a legitimate punishment for a true crime whereas sansa has not been accused of anything ned was killed for confessed treason so they dont have to worry about lannisters harming sansa for simple revenge even the lannisters still have to keep up with appearances of justice and would need to cause to punish sansai dont buy this at all they certainly do have to worry about the lannisters harming sansa for revenge not even robb and catelyn are naive enough to believe that the lannisters wouldnt hurt sansa if they found out about jaime losing a hand because its a legitimate punishment for a true crime plus the lannisters wouldnt hear about him getting his hand cut off for a legit crime and if they did they would deny it or just say he was forced to confess that cersei would never admit publicly that jaime threw bran out a window because she was caught screwing her twin brother also the lannisters did hurt sansa for simple revenge as joffrey had her stripped naked and beaten for robb winning a battle secondly i dont agree with the interpretation that losing his hand is what started jaime on his journey of redemption yes its part of it but ive always understood that it was briennes commitment to honor and to her vows that is the catalyst for jaimes change he knew that brienne detested him and all that he was kingslayer child murderer incestadulterytreason against his king etc yet was still willing to risk her life to see him reach kings landing safely because she had pledged to do so that its not about whether you like the things that your vows make you do its about keeping your word so i dont think losing his hand now has much of an impact on jaimes redemption arc its was brienne not his lost handi agree that its part of losing his hand and part with brienne but the two events are intertwined in my opinion if he loses his hand early he doesnt have brienne there to help him through it hes just rotting in a dungeon by himself so i think its too early to have him lose his hand without brienne being there not to mention completely out of character for robb to do so"
"The Scabbard Of the Morning",2011-06-16,"why would it be out of character for robb as the lord of winterfell to punish the man who just confessed to trying to kill his brother and causing his brother to be crippled for life"
"Arrogant Bastard",2011-06-16,"why would it be out of character for robb as the lord of winterfell to punish the man who just confessed to trying to kill his brother and causing his brother to be crippled for lifebecause as ive said he knows that jaime is a more valuable hostage intact and that joffrey will likely take sansas hand if he does that to jaime in asos robb learns that bolton has theon who he believes beheaded bran and rickon yet he agrees with bolton to keep theon in custody as a valuable hostage not to kill him theon was being tortured and flayed but the greyjoys did not hold any hostage of the starks"

"Arrogant Bastard",2011-06-16,"i think although the temptation is there to get back at the starks through sansa the lannisters ultimately need a cause for appearances sake they have to appear to be conducting the kings justice and they dont have one with sansa joffrey does punish sansa but its never to the face and not in public come to think of it the writer may be doing this to also establishing some motivation for sansas treatment and for why cersei never puts a stop to it in acokok first of all sansa is hit to the face in agot and her beating in acok was pretty much in public or else tyrion wouldnt have wandered in on it if in the book robb had actually cut off jaimes hand and joffrey heard about it do you really believe he wouldnt have sansa punished also do you believe that robb would actually think well if i cut off jaimes hand they wont do anything to sansa because the lannisters need a cause for appearances sake so they wont do anything also the act of maiming jaime would be a cause for appearances sake for the lannisters to harm sansa in retribution as i said before cersei would never acknowledge jaimes confession and would just say it was forced out of him through torture and it would appear that way because robb would have chopped off his hand"
"King_In_The_North",2011-06-16,"i think having cat talk to jaime before season 2 is a bad idea because she only discovers about jaimes and cerseis supposed incest when she meets with stannis she then manages to put all the parts together and realises that bran saw jaime and cersei together and thats how he fell she stayed in renlys tent while he was dressing for battle because she wanted to tell him that but then renly died which meant she had to run away and take brienne with her so they wont be framed for doing it now theyll just make cat staying in renlys tent a bit longer kinda pointless and it would only seem like she stayed there because the plot needed her to not because she had something very urgent to tell renly and wouldnt waste any time at telling him"

"SerArthurHeath",2011-06-17,"the worst thing about this theory is that its entirely plausible you can easily see a writer who doesnt know or care about robbjaimebriennes character arcs pulling a stunt like this purely to gratify the lannisterz are ebul crowd there will be much dissapoint if the tv adaption proves so shallowdoesnt robb cutting off jaimes hand put the act more in the poor lannisters robb stark has no honour and his father would rightfully be pissed off not happy camp"
"SerArthurHeath",2011-06-17,"you know what robb dies eventually too why not just have him killed by frey next episode and have tyrion kill tywin now and renly die off screen because that would save on time and still have the end result"

"TMWNN",2011-06-17,"little disappointing that theyd give away one of my favorite moments from the end of the books in the trailer but after the end of episode 9 i guess they felt they needed to hook people with the closest thing to a happy ending they were like to gonextepisode previews arent assembled by shows actual writers and directors but by network marketing people thats why they so frequently contain plot points similarly film previews are assembled by specialized previewsmaking companies thats why film trailers so often show all the best jokes in the movie or give away the whole plotthat said even assuming a viewer correctly deciphers what king in the north means and what it implies for future plotlines i would argue that sansa being shown her fathers head on a pike a scene we have been more or less told and shown is coming is more dramatic further king in the north is not the most important moment of the episode they have to show dragons make them sleeping at least it will be one of the most iconic tv scenes of all timethis is i completely agree done right ending the season with a naked daenerys exiting the funeral pyre with d r a g o n s wrapped around her put me down for the yes show them suckling camp for additional impact will cause a twitter frenzy that will easily eclipse sean bean getting his head cut off"
