"Aripyanfar",2012-05-28,"the wildfire explosion was completely spectacular but afterwards with the men screaming from over the water it was gutwrenching listening tyrions rallying speech was awesome the battle and yet even with all the battle scenes somehow i got caught up with the scenes in the womens quarter more my brain kind of got that theyd retreated to a tower room for safety and were tensely awaiting the outcome but as the episode unfolded my stomach finally got the crawling horror of their situation a stannis win no matter how i wanted joffrey to be toppled meant almost certain gang rape for all the women scarred for life possibly physically disfigured possibly a lingering slow death from rape or injury so they were awaiting the outcome of the battle to know when to commit mass suicide by their own hand or by ilyn paynes or not what a horrific wait"
"chico",2012-05-29,"definitely the best episode so far this season some things im looking forward to finding out  is tyrion just stunnedknockedout i was so fearful as i saw the scar show on his face that his head had just been sliced in half especially given all the other body chopping we saw  was stannis being pulled back by his own men or was he being captured it seemed like he was just being pulled away because it was time to retreat  will sansa go with the hound i know shes been crazydutiful so far but heres her chance that wildfire explosion is easily the 2nd best scene so far behind dany rising with her dragons from the fire wow"

"MegasAV",2012-05-27,"very enjoyable episode i rated an 8 only a few points of contention the sandorsansa scene clearly lacked the power of the book with sandor putting a blade to her throat and threatening to kill her for his song i thought the shows version was clearly not as good also i really dislike how incompetent they made davos and stannis out to be as battle commanders in the way in which tyrion implemented the wildfire attack i mean a single ship unsurrounded would raise no red flags with a seasoned commander like stannis but i know to some extent i am nitpicking the effect were great and given what type of budget they were working with i really felt they did a tremendous job"

"Tewks44",2012-05-27,"although tywins charge felt a bit rushed that overall scene with cersei telling the story of the lion cubs while tywins host was riding into battle was chillingly good i kind of wish they put more emphasis on the mass defections that occurred when everyone thought it was renly riding into battle but hey that was still probably one of the best things ive seen on tv 1010 edit and the hounds exit was awesome when he said fuck the kingsgaurd my expression pretty much mirrored tyrions exactly and i knew what was coming to boot edited by tewks44 27 may 2012  1147 pm"

"Gaius Martell",2012-05-27,"this was the best episode yet i guess thats to be expected when they spent the whole episode on four povs theres enough time to spend on each one lena headey was spoton and peter dinklage once again gives tyrion such bravado that he is impossible not to love the only scene that seemed new was the hound bronn scene which i thought added quite a bit and since both are among my favorite characters it was like fan service in a way changing the battle to nighttime was a wise decision by the directors methinks adding to the glory of this episode is whats needed in the next one closure on arya jaqen arstan and strong belwas hotu and jon snows next actions ramsay in winterfell i hope and perhaps a bit more jaime brienne yeah this season turned out alright edited by gaius martell 27 may 2012  1156 pm"

"boojam",2012-05-28,"i felt exactly the same way about stannis going first up the ladder with no protection the reason kings and generals didnt lead their armies from the front historically is because it generally turned out disastrously for every leonidas who dies heroically theres a brasidas who dies fighting over a stupid city like amphipolisit kind of varied didnt it alexander the great did lead from the front nearly got him killed in india not sure about julius caesar once he became commanding general i dont think he did seems i remember for the most part the roman emperors did lead from rear or were not at the battle at alltho in medieval warfare  which is the model here the in front lead commander was  not always the king but warfare evolved such this mode of operation was abandonedah well  i am not sure what george may have writtenit seems like a glitch why does stannis not wear a helm in action was that true in the book in the book he was not at the kl assault in fact in this episode we see  at one point one of his men shielding stanniss head with a shield it would have been an easy action sequence to fix even if stannis went first just carrying a shield would have made more sensebut i think part of that is not really knowing wtf he was doing maybe i missed something did that battlement lead directly to the holdfast or was there some other directly strategic value therei can see why clearing the battlement of defenders may have been necessary to enable the breaking of the gate and allow the assault to be less harassed must of been a budget thing because from the point of view the battlement seemed to shrink  maybe all those tight camera angles edited by boojam 28 may 2012  0257 am"

"Ser Graymax",2012-05-28,"want to give it a 10 but i just cant although a 9 isnt bad and i havent seen it a second time yet just seemed a little rushed to me and we never got the feeling of the massiveness of the numbers involved in the battle perhaps this should have been spread over 2 episodes but i realize the constraints still some of the best tv ever id love to see this entire series on the big screen with massive sound we needed the little girl from dispicable me looking out the battlements and yelling to tyrion its so green pig shit and turtles and sandor finally speaking his mind oh my all of the changes seem to be coming together very nicely some people just have no patience to wait for the big picture their loss edited by ser graymax 28 may 2012  0656 am"
"duncanthemedium",2012-05-28,"i wonder how anyone willfully gave this episodes the 6s and the 7s i spot up there hmmm so a 10 would be the televisation of the second coming or would jesus visual effects and make up or whatever maybe even get that down to a 9 dunnogif classbbcemoticon altdunno "
"The Black Wolf",2012-05-28,"loved it 1010 the wildfire was amazing sansa and cersei talking was just incredible and the final scene with cersei and tommen had me crying oh and of course the hound was awesome fuck the kingsguard fuck the city fuck the king i think its the first time i have absolutely no complaints whatsoever only i would have wanted this episode to go on forever because now we only have one episode left this season"

"Sanette",2012-05-28,"martin is a pure genius i wish he could write all the episodes there was more drama in this episode alone than in the whole season i loved the changes stannis leading the attack was a nice touch it reminded me why i like his character and the final shot with loras as renlys ghost and cersei with tommen on the throne was just breathtaking the best episode this season and i have absolutely no complaints hopefully dd felt inspired by it and the finale is at least half as good 1010"
"Sydney Losstarot",2012-05-28,"between 7 and 8 for me considering the difficulty of translating the books epic battle on tv they did and amazing job but in spite of all their efforts notably shooting at night and using epic music and all it still felt small scale in some parts there are also problems with the pacing notably tyrions sortie felt awfully rushed the highlights of this episode are very strong though incredible incredible performance from lena headey just the perfect cersei i loved all of her scenes sansa is most definitely coming into her own too i liked the scene with sandor in her room even though it was weaker than the books but the acting she put out when realising that sandor would not hurt her was just perfect sandor does not feel half as menacing and dangerous as book sandor though the way he said fuck the king and all felt weak too but the scene with bronn in the tavern was good bronn is very well casted and played i like the actor playing davos very much he exudes calmness and authority and humbleness just like the character in the book incredible cgi on the wildfire explosion that felt epic indeed no problem there the gory effects in the batlle such as clegane cutting guys in two and stannis splitting heads feltcheap like a b zombie movie this was so bad it took me out of the action also i can understand why they would put stannis on the front line but wellthis was soooo out of character stannis is a commander hes not lacking bravery and has surely seen his share of battle but he commands from the rear to keep a clear vision of whats happening having him rush the walls without a helmet feltoh im sorry it just felt ridiculous overall im not happy with the characterisation of stannis up until now melisandre has more charisma than him if i didnt know him better from the books a magnificent tyrion as usual the scene where the kings guard cuts him thoughfelt weak and come on tyrion its just a little cut this time why fall on the ground like he cut your nose or something im very critical but overall it was a good time i dont feel it was the incredible tv epic some of you guys describe though but it was still very good thank you cersei"

"Lord of Cheese",2012-05-28,"not bad not bad some things annoyed me though i didnt like the fact that everyone seems to be wielding a valyrian steel sword so many bodies being cloven in two and heads halved cleanly silly even tyrion had a valyrian steel axe cutting off a leg and the splatting dd have been watching too many old chinese martial arts movies were blood sprays after a cut i didnt like tyrions scar maybe im wrong but it looks like a fairly clean cut he will lose an eye but doesnt look like he will lose part of his nose and have a hideous scar they should have opened it up more hehe make it more gruesome to scare the hell out of the viewers but maybe they dont want to ruin his face too much so he is still recognisable on tv lancel not getting cut down badly enough was it communicated clear enough that sandor was afraid of the fire and not just the battle in the books we can see the inner dialogue going on in sandors head but not in tv i will ask my non bookreader friends tomorrow what i liked sandor sansa cersei illyns facial expression lol pretty much nailed though the dialogue impressed a lot the chain would have made it epic though but they would have had to change the battle dynamics and made it much larger scale not surprised to learn that grrm wrote this one by the 7 bloody hells its obvious it was him the other writers were rubbish compared to him martin to write them all"
"Chelly",2012-05-28,"a 1010 for me that episode was sheer perfection i loved every moment of it everybody brought their a game in this episode sansa was fantastic this episode cersei was at her absoulute best that scene between her and tommen was heartbreaking i cant believe i used the term heartbreaking in regards to cersei shes such a nasty vile woman but she has her moments stannis was on im loving terminator stannis cutting fuckers down who get in his way sandor was also amazing this episode i love seeing the other side of sandor first with the fire phobia and then in his moment with sandor i dont care but i fistpumped at fuck the kingsguard fuck the city fuck the king the look on joffs face was priceless"

"miguel sanchez",2012-05-28,"that kicked raw assso many of those scenes were fuckin perfect the actors fuckin nailed those classic lines from the book bronn and the gold cloaks singing the rains of castamere an awesome inclusion the wildfire explosion off the fuckin chain the violence the hound stannis bronn all extremely badass oh and that whole scene with cersei and sansa was really fantastic and true to the book like i thought lena headey was a fairly good cersei but now its elevated to a damn near perfect cersei the hound walking out was great as was joffrey being a little puss and better still was tyrion getting his moment as the hero great battle speach and then he gets to kill some guys i loved it when tyrion kills guys when i was reading and then you fuckin have tywin riding in at the end and cerseis little story to tommen and ahem medicine tyrion gettin hacked and pod saving him ahh man whole ending was brilliant i loved stannis having to be dragged away from the battle yelling stand and fight damn you its so stannis dude is nothing if not determinedgave it a fuckin 10 fuckin aye ive given one 9 and two 8s but this is my first fuckin perfect 10"
"pleonasm",2012-05-28,"my first impression was that this was really impressive the hour flew by not perfect by any means but very well done there was a couple of really outstanding moments even joffrey and lancel was written with a more nuanced hand tonight i loved what happened with davros and his son truly tragic a couple of minor quibbles other than for dumbing for the audience i dont know why they didnt show more of the kings landing fleet moored in the bay it would have taken the wildfire explosion which was awesome to a whole new level of awesomeness i wasnt sold on the sansa and the hound scene given the direction they went with the scene i wish they had made the hound stinking drunk at this point so sansas motivation to not go with him would make more sense a scene or two of stannis commmanding would have been helpful yes  ass kicking stannis is cool but he was leading an army and we kinda lost that with his rushing ahead at every opportunity other than tyrions the slice and dice cgi shots of decapitating soldiers were silly and did take u out of the moment that said this was so much better than the last three episodes and easily one of the most rewatchable episodes in the series history a solid 9"
"Greywolf2375",2012-05-28,"good episode but i just do not see how everyone is rating it so high the battle of blackwater wasnt anything like the book and was dumbed down and cheesy i love the show but the battle was terrible with cgi nowadays no excuse for not following the book more closely i think it looked like a b movie battle actually dark and cheaply made my opinionmy guess as to why many people are rating it highly is because the acting  dialogue was the best this series has seen the battle  as fun as it was to watch  was completely made secondary to the characters  which is exactly how grrm wrote the books yes the books had the creeping snakes of flame and hundreds of shipsand the show didnt but it did have cgi that made  as triskele pointed out  the 6th highest grossing film of all time rotk looks like i made the graphics with crayola crayons everyone is different everyone has their opinion but try watching this one again for the people not the explosions and maybe youll see it in a different light"
"Mooncat",2012-05-28,"easily the best episode of game of thrones so far the buildup from the last episode was slow but this definitively made up for the waiting despite the lack of renly ghost and chain i thought the battle was brilliant the acting was even better sophie turner was fantastic i couldnt stop shouting that joffrey was such a little shit jack gleeson is doing so much right the hound still creeps me out and i still dont care about davos 1010 without a doubt seriously there was finally an actual battle"
"Greywolf2375",2012-05-28,"regarding hollywoodizing stannis and other major characters in any movieshow its the fact that they rarely given them helmets stannis could have had his head crushedbut this episode 10 10 10 10 10 10 on everythingseen this a few times  take blackhawk down the producers decided they had to put names on each characters helmets to make sure the audience could identify the characters easily same thing here  is it unrealistic sure but with the number of people not being able to identify that it was a kingsguard  moore  that nicked off tyrions cheek i think it was the right choice for them to have some characters go without helmscourse it would have been bad ass if they did have the hound with his dog helmet on as long as it didnt bounce around like it was made of aluminum foil"

"saucyjak",2012-05-28,"my guess as to why many people are rating it highly is because the acting  dialogue was the best this series has seen the battle  as fun as it was to watch  was completely made secondary to the characters  which is exactly how grrm wrote the books yes the books had the creeping snakes of flame and hundreds of shipsand the show didnt but it did have cgi that made  as triskele pointed out  the 6th highest grossing film of all time rotk looks like i made the graphics with crayola crayons everyone is different everyone has their opinion but try watching this one again for the people not the explosions and maybe youll see it in a different lighti agree masterfully done episode when considering the dialogue and acting the characters are what makes this series so wonderful the epicness of the battle of blackwater was lost i just do not see whay everyone is giving it a 10 unless its a 10 considering the lack of funds they had for the battle scenes regardless i loved the episode just trying to bring things down to earth a bit inject a little reality"

"TeamDanyArya",2012-05-28,"to quote spinal tap this goes to 11 or 100 if i could blackwater was the single greatest thing ive seen done on tv that was nonsports related i loved the backandforth between the action sequences and cersei all the similarities and contrasts between cersei and sansa sansa acting like the adult in the situation and trying to stay calm while cersei gets her drunk on her very careful sarcastic reply to joffery about being stupid bring out your inner direwolf i started tearing up when the hound freaked out at the fire and turned craven touching scene between him and sansa no im not a sansan shipper and adds complexity to his character cersei at the end with tommen and the vial of nightshade choked me up even though i have read the books but there was still that part of me that wondered tyrion was awesome as always and the camera angle of tywin and loras at the end was cool this was the first time my husband and i have done an immediate rewatch of the episode well definetly be rewatching it a few more times this week my only minor gripe is we didnt get a scene with tyrion bitchslapping joffery and he really needed that overall ive enjoyed most of the added stuff this season having read all the books i know what is going to happen so to keep me as a tv viewer interested i want those added scenes as long as the integrity of the characters and story stay in place"

"Pinn",2012-05-28,"stannis going up the ladder first really never a big fan of rah rah speeches to the troops even if it was as sardonic as the one delivered by tyrion other than that an excellent episode i particularly liked the maturity that sansa displayed the implicit barbs in her nuanced conversations displays how far she has travelled from her early naivete at beginning of the series she also looks better with her hair down"

"Tywin's bastard",2012-05-28,"great episode and they really showed that they had a bigger budget here a great payoff to whats been built up this far still i dont think that if you have had criticism against previous episodes you can find things to complain about here as well i think the knowledge of that grrm wrote the episode will make some negative people ignore the flaws more though the thing that set this episode out from the rest apart from that it actually had a huge battle of course was that it was allowed to follow a single location the entire time that makes it so much easier to make things flow together"

"gmavridis",2012-05-28,"one of the best episodes of the series i think everybody would love for grrm to have the time to write the script it is the only episode of the second season that is up to the standards of the book even the stannis scene could not overshadow the excellence of the work also i think the director did excellent job the only spot was that anyone who hasnt read the books cannot understand at once the scene with loras pretending to be renly"
"sadfascist",2012-05-28,"as many people that are rating this ten they are all saying basically that the episode could not be better or improved uponno what were saying is that blackwater met and greatly exceeded any reasonable expectations we could have for a budgetconstrained adaption of an unfilmable story and we are saying that while each individual part may not be perfect the whole is greater than the partstaken within the context of the show and especially within what is an otherwise lackluster season grrm and neil marshall delivered an episode that riveted me from the first sweeping shot of blackwater bay all the way through the last note of the closing credits did i wish there were more extras yes did i wish stannis wore a helmet yes did i wish sansa sang a song for the hound yes but none of it mattered because even if all those things had been true blackwater could not have been more epic than it already is a pitchperfect roller coaster of suspense terror awe exultation and catharsisthis was a tremendous episode gots finest hour"
"Cuthbert Allgood",2012-05-28,"i loved this episode but of course i love the series anyway whats a bit annoying to me isok i might be entering troll territory here but i am so sure if we were told this episode was written by someone who isnt grrm a lot of people including elio and linda  would find so many things to bash so many downs and not so many tops i can see how this board would be filled with cersei would never say that varys giving a map to tyrion lol why do they think they are better writers than grrm sandor and bronn scene was so wrong my point isall these people who are now saying this is how you adapt are annoying the seven hells out of me all episodes have this much diversions from the books or had managed to keep the spirit of books to this degree overall this episode was not so different than others in terns of adaptation or diversion from books"

"SFA-OK",2012-05-28,"710 one of the better episodes some good some bad i thought cersei sansa and joffrey were all really good as usual the explosion of the wildfire was really really well done the rest of the battle scene had some comical stuff thrown in imo like the top of the guys head getting chopped off minor gripe but even with the budget constraints would it have been too hard to throw in some far away or overhead shots to show more of the boats and stannis army i think it wouldve just added a nice epicness to the battle which has been missing throughout the show wasnt a fan of the sansahound scene book version way better its actually one of my favorite parts of the book i did like the cerseisansa scene though"

"gogorath",2012-05-28,"couple of quick thoughts i dont think lena headey was nominated for an emmy by hbo and i know blackwater was not submitted i think because either it wasnt completely done or because they didnt want spoilers out there but both are a shame i think lena has outperformed everyone this year  dinklage dance maisie even alfie who has been 2  as the script has given her more to do ive never thought of her as a great or poor actress but shes really been fantastic this year and i wonder if my prior impression was lack of great roles i havent seen her in a ton and while this episode wasnt perfect or even my favorite of the series baelor for me it was done very well and it was something never before done on tv but please stop complaining about scale complain about pace characters whatever not scale season one had a lot of scenes that lacked it the tourney the hunt etc most of that was budget when you look at this season the melee stannis fleet blackwater understand that the scale you want and remember from the books may only be really possible with the type of money they arent going to spend complaining does no good 99 of networks and producers wouldnt have even attempted to show the battle dont look a gift horse in the mouth"
"AndrA©s Garcia",2012-05-28,"this episode was among the most epic and engaging things ive ever seen on television at the moment i cant even take seriously the suggestion that this is worth less than a 9 or a 10 it gets the latter score from me it is one of the brightest highlights from the whole series"

"NeilSpoon",2012-05-28,"i just watched it in the uk and will give it a 10  the  being for the ending being too sudden for my liking tywin riding inyup weve won credits apart from that it was of course perfect what did completely spoiled it for me however is the fact that sky atlantic basically hbo for the uk put 4 advert blocks in it completely took away the pace and didnt get the chance to get fully immersed in it"
"MrDoog",2012-05-28,"absolutely brilliant episode i give it a 9 i think you can only give a 10 if you couldnt possibly improve on anything and as great as this episode was it wasnt 100 perfect this was after all the most exciting part of cok to draw from and bring to tv screens so there was some room for improvement but not much people here complaining about stannis being first up the ladder is a bit silly it was an blatant way of grrm showing how he and joffrey are polar opposites one king hiding behind his mums skirts while the other is battered and bloody and doesnt even want to retreat even when the day is lost and nitpicking on the fact that stannis wasnt wearing a helmet is even more ridiculous  its tv for christs sake the battle is at night and the guy in question is merely a secondary character in a show which has an absolutely massive cast you have to make the show accessible for those who havent read the books i must say of all 19 episodes so far this was the one i was most looking forward to while at the same time halfdreading in case they screwed it up it was quality a strong 910"

"Ogamoose",2012-05-28,"great episode i gave it a 9 only because i thought the chains might have added another cruncher to the wildfire explosion but very well adapted indeed overall sansa showed a little spine at last and joffreys cravenness came through nicely this episode just saved the season for me"
"ipsuel",2012-05-28,"10 from me brilliant episode brilliant tv in general just freakn amazing"
"Hasfast",2012-05-28,"ok i read five pages straight of comments agree with most and strongly disagree with others as for my personal opinion this episode extremely rockedits been a while since i concluded that unlike the first season which clearly seemed to have been made more like a close adaptation of the novel with many parts even strictly resembling the actual scenes as described in the book this season sets off its own path and is as much a complement to the original work as it is an adaptation of it we see characters and events much more developed andor interpreted from different angles in the book stannis is rather absent from this battle merely mentioned even later his leading the siege is referenced only vaguely in here we see part of what he did and we can take it for cannon martin himself wrote this after allthose who judge too harshly should actually be opening themselves to the perspectives of events already related in the books because most of the times we only have one two at best this battle probably has the most povs involved in any scene of the books with davos sansa and tyrion all providing feedback to whats going on but thats a rare case the only one i can rememberto those who actually believe this was a cheap battle scene well you should either stop watching the series or start taking it for what it is a tv show with limited budget with which theyve been doing seriously hell of a job particularly in this episode odd that readers of fantasy have such a hard time opening their minds to interpretations purism in fiction is rather antithesis i thinki absolutely loved this episode and have loved the season ever since i decided to play by its rules and not the books i encourage all who still have trouble with the series to do the same dr"
"Eye.H8.Sansa",2012-05-28,"this is an overall good episode i would have given it a higher rating but there was too much sansa and cersei in there i cant stand sansa stark i actually like shae the whore more than sansa"
"Owdoo",2012-05-28,"it was a pity the chain was left out but i was awed by the wildfire explosion scenes and i have to say i found it a bit of a stretch to believe that stannis was first up the ladder with no protection on his head when defenders are throwing rocks and raining arrows down from the battlements i get that its tv and the main characters have to be recognisable but surely there is a compromise somewhere which is a bit closer to what might really happen in such a situation it doesnt have to be a full face helm same goes for the hound wouldnt his helm make him very recognisable anyway that said i think the second half of this 2nd season has been much stronger than the first half and blackwater continued the improving trend overall i thought they did a good job with the budget they had available and i enjoyed the episode a lot 910 oh and the rains of castamere song was cool too shame the sky continuity announcer in the uk decided to spoil the atmosphere of the closing credits version by speaking over it"
"Dacie",2012-05-28,"10 exceeded my expectations brilliant episode"
"AegonIV",2012-05-28,"definitely enjoyed the episode and on the whole i like the choices that were made regarding deviations from the books however i do believe that tyrions chain could and should have been included a set up in an earlier episode  tyrion telling all the smiths in kings landing to begin constructing large links and assembling them would be enough to plant the concept in the viewers minds and then the pay off would be manifested by simply showing men on either side of the blackwater towing it out of the water at the signal men on the ships would only then have to report that an enormous chain was preventing escape not perfect but it certainly could be done without an enormous increase in budget imo i could be wrong but this is a critical storycharacter point it makes tyrion look like a masterful tactician and prevents davos from looking somewhat foolish an empty ship approaching an armada has got to raise suspicions in any competent commander particularly one who has survived using his wits to avoid being trapped or bought by surprise deal breaker nah still a great episode"
"Caio T",2012-05-28,"1010 so many great things about this episode the freaking hound finally he had a big space in an ep his scenes was great especially the one he turned away from the battle fk the king yea i was susprised when i saw stannis leading the attack that was unexpected melisandre must have put some weird asshai magic to protect him lolgif classbbcemoticon altlol  weird that she didnt appear didnt like the way he was dragged when it was lost though cersei was great this episode i knew how that was going to end but i got really scared when she was about to poison tommen one moment she was about to poison her son and 10 second later she was so happy hugging him tyrion turned out to be a nice commender after all halfman halfman halfman i didnt realise at first that it was his father he was looking at when he was fainting and podrick was so brutal he broke the spear stunnedgif classbbcemoticon altstunned  the only thing i really missed was already mentioned a few times it was when loras got to battle they should be shouting renly or something like this so it would look like renly himself was leading the attack did anyone noticed the look on cerseis face after loras showed himself to her she looked really scared she didnt seem to know which side was he on"

"Fez",2012-05-28,"well god damn if that wasnt something thats a 1010 but this one goes to 11 so so much to love even without all the added suspense that im sure nonreaders mustve felt about how things might turn out i loved or at least really liked just about every episode of the series thus far with maybe 2 misfires so i dont want to say this one blew them out of the water but in a way it really really did it elevated the show to a whole other place through some combination of grrms script marshalls directing the extra budget and the catharsis of 18 and a 12 episodes worth of tension being broken in 25 brutal wonderful minutes i think my favorite scene though is one that im not seeing mentioned much it was just the short tracking shots before and after bronntyrion itself a great bit and before tyrion and sansa started talking also great just seeing men rushing through a throne room completely empty except for those massive braziers to head towards the walls for some reason it was then despite already knowing the battle was going to be shown that it just hit me that holy fuck this is actually going to go down and it is going to be awesome also enough good stuff cant ever be said about stannis i wasnt really a fan of bookstannis until adwd but since i did end up a fan i was more readily on his side earlier this season these past two episodes though it doesnt matter what preconceptions i had about him i am forever and always on showstannis side spoiler i do hope though that he sets sail for the wall by the end of season 3 even if you dont know thats where hes headed yet i dont think i could stand more than a whole season of him just hanging around dragonstone though the snails was it snails in the fire scene should be good oh and the blackwater on fire has at least temporarily replaced discworld being carried through the cosmos by the great atuin as my desktop background"
"lostinwesteros",2012-05-28,"just cruising through to see if there were any votes lower than a 10 some surprise but i see most are hugging 10 pretty closely then there are those of us who would give it a definite 11 on that scale of 10 me i could go up to a 15 at least"
"packersfan",2012-05-28,"i gave a 9 really only a few complaints haha i was under the impression that the battle occurred during the day or at least the sun was rising as the ghost of renly saved the day for kings landing thinking about it though i see two reasons for making the battle at night 1 increased effect of fire and wildfire 2 can hide more soldiers in the darkness thus not requiring a ton of extras or cgi i wonder if they got rid of the whole chain across the bay or if that will be elaborated on in the next episode as davos and stannis attempt to escape to safety obviously due to budget restraints they eliminated the awesome sounding ship to ship fighting where in the books actually tyrion is attacked by the kingsguardsman and pod saves him thankfully this episode did not introduce any drastic plot diversions from the bookssince martin himself wrote this episode he stayed pretty faithful to his own work haha i was going to criticize the opening scene with bronn and the hound as just another chance to show boobs but the scene actually worked and wasnt just wasted camera time for hbo smut unlike earlier scenes this season those are my criticisms but on a whole this episode was the best of the season even though it had a lowbudget feel to it besides the wildfire"
"GSP",2012-05-28,"gave it a ten cause thats all that i was allowed to give awesome adaptation bridge of burning ships would have been cool but prohibitively expensive i get it damn i wish they had a boundless budget"
"Ser Mixalot",2012-05-28,"10 loved this episode also have to give credit to the actor who plays joffrey everyone hates him and that means hes doing his job well i could almost feel the heat coming off the television during the wildfire scene nasty stuff the back and forth between the chaos of battle and cersei worked really well too excellent job the rains of castamere during the credits was brilliant"

"Greywolf2375",2012-05-29,"watched it a few times to me it wasnt a perfect episode it was however far greater than the sum of its parts the acting was the best theyve had  it was like everyone was given their draught of acting 5 the writing was the best theyve had  it was like well grrm wrote it fancy that the imagery was the best theyve had  the ships in the dark views from the castle walls bronns arrowthat wildfire thing the action was the most theyve had  there were quick cuts and maybe one too many people being split like firewood but hey  this is slightly fantastical are there gripes sureit looks like after bronn and the hound had their stare down that cersei brought her entourage into the same room one single ship and no reaction to it too many people being cut in half a few too many quick cuts in scenes that made it jump around it was not a perfect epsiode whatever that means it was perfect for me 10 edit not too shabby a 955 rating average so far edited by â<U+008A>eda vlk2375 29 may 2012  0830 am"
"Lady Lilac",2012-05-29,"there were some issues especially during the fighting scenes but over all it was by far the best of the season so 1010"
"WildlingGirl",2012-05-29,"definitely a 10 and epic and a lot of foreshadowing i was blown away by the wildfire explosion sansa behaving like a queen yet seeking comfort in the spurned doll cerseis story to tommen on the iron throne tyrions sortie yet forgot to look crestfallen when tyrions face was sliced so my viewer bf understood hes not dead oh well biggrinpng classbbcemoticon altd "
"goonerjon777",2012-05-29,"well i thought it was fabulous too many people on here are far too critical its a tv adaptation for christs sake not a hollywood block buster my highlights i was in awe of the wildfire cersei was brilliant the hound came in to his own cant wait for grrm to write more episodes well played sir"

"Tadco26",2012-05-29,"as someone who has been disappointed by this season as a whole i thought this episode was great and the only 10 i have given for this season any minor nitpicks or scenes i was hoping to see that didnt make it were minor enough not to detract at all granted i would love for them to have a lord of the rings movie budget to do the battles but given the budget constraints i thought it was awesome a virtually perfect example of how to do an adaptation and still stick very close to how the book story plays out the extremely minor things i missed 1 no chain which in the context of the show at this point made sense no way they could have built the chain in that length of time since they hadnt mentioned it in previous episodes and i imagine it would be very hard to make it visible in a night scene anyway plus it would have made davos look like an idiot to lead them into the chained off bay when he was the one pointing out the flaws in not sending ahead scouts in the books and noting the new towers which held the chain 2 sansa and the hounds scene didnt quite make it clear why she refused to leave with him since she said he wouldnt hurt her when if i remember correctly she was quite afraid of him at that point in the book didnt force her to sing to him i know some nonreaders seem to be confused on if she went with him or not and have made comments that she is an idiot if she did not which its hard to argue with in the context of the show 3 it threw me off slightly for the hound to directly refuse joffreys order refusing tyrion was one thing refusing joffrey in the manner he did seems it would have gotten him killed or at least some reaction from the other soldiers and kings guard rather than just let him walk off like i said exteremely minor things that were more expectations than complaints outside the context of this particular episode i wonder about what they are doing with ser dontas and if any nonreaders will even remember who he is by the time he shows up again"
"A Redeemed Hound",2012-05-29,"had to give it a 10 it was almost flawless my one minor complaint is why didnt the hound wear his hound helmet that is the coolest helmet ever he never wears the fing thing should have worn it when he rescued sansa a few weeks ago too other than that grrm should now be forced to write every episode and neil marshal must direct them all as well there was such a quality difference with the cast and writing for episode 10 the wild fire scene was jaw dropping and sansa was also awesome my mother cant believe they killed tyrion he he he"

"kirazikins",2012-05-29,"absolutely brilliant i loved everything about it yes some things were missing the chain sansas song to the hound but i really enjoyed it still i had goosebumps throughout all of it"
"bardgal",2012-05-29,"in one vast swoop of sandors sword that episode made me forget every complaint ive had with this series sure it wasnt quite like the book but as far as bringing the best of blackwater to the tv screens the did it with stunning resultsit was directed well produced brilliantly and very well writteni have no real complaints to add except for the need for ad breaksad breaks you need ad breaks or where you are has ad breaks if its the latter im wondering where is that that shows got with ad breaks shockedgif classbbcemoticon altshocked "
"A Redeemed Hound",2012-05-29,"i just hope next week is as brilliant as this week i have my doubts i really hope the house of the undying is as awesome and mysterious and trippy as it is in the books if they do it right it will make up for a rather lame qarth this season"

"gogorath",2012-05-29,"its weird how any rating less than 10 not even an 8 or a 9 is deemed too critical wow easy folksi think most of this is cause by the fact that we all have a different scale of what 110 meanswhats the comparison set all tv other hbo series just elite tv like mad men the wire the sopranos breaking bad just things i watch the emotion you felt when you read the books full scale hollywood movieswhats the criteria for a 10 someone previously said it has to be perfect for it to be a ten  kind of the gymnastics type of judging others dont start at a 10 and subtract  they allow for positives to completely outweigh negatives if the positives are awesome enough to them what are you grading and whats your focus fidelity to the books execution by the filmmakers and acting just the emotional impact it has on you for me its really hard to see someone seeing this as an 8 based on how i grade for a television show the battle execution was unprecented if this battle was an eight what does a show have to do to get a 10 portraying a battle but perhaps someone else just doesnt care for battles so its hard for me to see the grade until i realize they really dont care about that and while i thought there were things to be improved no episode would get a ten if i did the gymnasticstyle judging  so i dont  but some do and thats fine even if that means 10s are hard to come by but for me the battle scenes were so much better than i felt we had a right to expect plus i thought the cersei scenes were great as were tyrions the sansahound scene was just okay to me and the end was deliberately a bit confusing but that was all well overcome for me by the awesomenesswe may actually agree on a lot of individual points but may come up with different grades and thats before even getting to places where people differ on how well it was done period but since each of us assumes our way of grading is superior your 8 is freaking crazy smilepng classbbcemoticon alt "
"drm7",2012-05-29,"i rated it a 9 but it was actually more like a 949999 than a 8500001 i thought that baelor was the only 10 stunning visceral episode easily the best of the season lena headey was awesome i knew that the episode was done right when my heart actually leapt seeing loras and tywin burst into the throne room i was shocked at my reaction why am i cheering for tywin lannister damn you mr martin oh and the green explosion was offthecharts incredible only very minor quibbles 1 i know that stannis is a psycho control freak but personally climbing a ladder up the wall stephen dillane is incredible though 2 sansan would have been better had it stuck closer to the books i dont think that it would have added shooting time andor budget so im puzzled that the producers and theahemwriter took some of the juice out of the scene"

"gmavridis",2012-05-29,"that ladies and gentlemen is how you write the show changes yes characters remaining within the paradigm of what the showrunners have defined cersei and sandor most notably yep but it all actually clicks togethermy biggest beefs i wish they didnt have to hollywoodize stannis and have him swinging his sword in the forefront but okay you want to give him an action moment i guess and i wish someone had been shouting renly and youd see the guys in renlys kit still throwing down their swords or turning on their ownbut uh those complaints they are minori just confirmed with friends and family all no readers that they did not understand the scene with renly most of them did not even notice loras and they thought that tywin was the one that won the battle everything else was perfect"

"TyrionTargaryen",2012-05-29,"i knew that the episode was done right when my heart actually leapt seeing loras and tywin burst into the throne room i was shocked at my reaction why am i cheering for tywin lannister damn you mr martini thought the same thing tywin was like the battle is over and we have wonnow i know what it was like for darth vader when his thoughts betrayed him i guess i was rooting for tyrion the whole time but davos is right there as one of my favorites cant wait to see him on the merlin rocks or whatever they are called"

"Lady of Long Lake",2012-05-29,"910 first 10 minutes were pretty mediocre the bron  hound was a bore after that it was great with a really fantastic final scenei was thinking the same thing david when i was watching it why the hell are they wasting precious time in the blackwater episode showing us naked chicks in a barbut it made some weird sense after sandor had his meltdown he was 2 seconds away from being killed by the flaming guy when bronn shot him bronn gives him a shit eating grin and nods like dont worry i got your back big guy the guy he was going to kill in the bar 5 minutes ago saves his life whilest hes frozen with fear it added to sandors unraveling scene i think"
"Ditocorto",2012-05-30,"btw stannis suddenly became a huge badass were too far from the gates hundreds will die thousands"
"ICE CROW",2012-05-30,"ran after reading your analysis there is something i must mention im not sure if anyone else has mentioned it yet so i will you talked about how the final sandorsansa scene was missing something that happened in the book the giving of his kingsguard whitecloak the thing is she already has it in the scene where sansa is being stripped by ser meryn and tyrion comes in and saves her from further abuse sandor is the one who rips of his cloak and gives it to sansa she then leaves with it from that scene on sandor no longer has a whitecloak in any other scenes so sansa does have sandors whitecloak to remember him by in the future obviously different then how it happened in the book but we end up with the same result edit i just double checked there is only one scene after the throne room scene where sandor is wearing a whitecloak the scene where sansa thanks him for saving her i think this was a continuity error more than anything because except for that scene he never wears a cloak again after giving her his no matter what though she does have one of sandors whitecloaks which is what is important edited by ice crow 30 may 2012  0126 am"

"Silverjaime",2012-05-30,"the acting was superb throughout the special effects were excellent i cant even decide which scene i liked best  bron firing the arrow cersies drunken nastiness tyrion taking charge stannis fighting on no matter what his men do sansa saying you wont hurt me etc etc georges dialogue was spot on lots of wit and memorable lines from everyone season two started off quite disappointingly imo but this episode was probably one of the best hours of tv ive ever seen how are they gonna follow that"
"Turkey Jack",2012-05-30,"my expectations are obviously too high the blackwater was the best part of the books flicking from one point of view to another added to the tensions watching stannis lead the attack with no shield or helm broke the immersion for me and i could not take it seriously how he manages to get from the battlements through the enemy and back to his ship i have no idea the wildfire seen was amazing  the fighting on the river was shortened for obvious reasons but i think sandor gets a bit of a raw deal as retreats at the first sign of fire tyrion leading the attack on foot much cheaper in an already expensive episode also defies common sense not to mention the coolest kill in the books is ser mandon first written charge non combat sections where well done although sandor bronn was a little odd unless there will be a future arc to come out of it"
"phedre",2012-05-30,"i have to rate it a 10 ive already rewatched it twice totally lived up to expectations and the dialogue was absolutely brilliant we had to rewindrewatch the tell the hound to tell the hand several times right away we were laughing so hard"

"Uknownothing",2012-05-30,"i have to agree with most of the posters i thought the episode was excellent easily one of the best in the series i thought the battle scenes were very well produced and i find that leena hadley is really making me hate cersei a lot less than i did when i read the books her scene with tommen on the iron throne was great i am sad that the season is almost over and it will be months before we get to start again"
"tfoxx22",2012-05-30,"definitely a great episode 910"
"Glyndwr",2012-05-31,"the sheer volume  scale of the books makes it impossible to adhere perfectly to every character  story arc in a tv conversion the same way as peter jacksons lotr movies veered of in places but 17 oscars cant be wrong grrms input was evident even in the changed scenes  all in all it made for some amazing viewing and when bronn was singing the rains of castamere it really was a goosebump moment i have even found myself liking the lannisters a bit lately"

"Lord Tywin",2012-06-02,"9510 oddly lena headey sp made this episode for me as far as im concerned shes now joined dance dinklage cosmo and maybe a couple of others at the head of the class in a series that features generally strong acting all around i dont know what she did between seasons 1  2 but shes really brought it this year this whole season has seemed really dark as in the picture quality not the thematic tone since this one happened exclusively at night it was hard for me to make out some things i have perfect eyesight but perhaps my environment or my tv is notsoperfect although its been the same on my lcd monitor the battle scenes were especially murky or was that intentional it wouldnt be unreasonable if it were that aside my only quibbles are stannis the barbarian charging up the ladder with no protection the sandorsansa scene lacked intensity or a reason for her to stay in kings landing and whats happened to dontos the lack of an imp chain and tyrions wounding ser mandon is supposed to slip before striking hence his botched assassination attempt and there appeared to be no reason for him to only slice across tyrions face again i could have just missed something due to the darkness though i couldnt see a reason for it at first but by the end i thought the sandorbronn scene was just meant to reemphasize that the hound is bold enough to challenge bronn so his fuck the king scene wasnt just him being a chicken shit when the going gets tough that illustration would be more for nongrrm readers since other viewers would know exactly why he leaves grrms reaction to any claims that the writer of this episode doesnt know jack about westeros would be priceless edited by lord tywin 02 june 2012  1259 pm"

stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099> ships were terrorized the way tyrion worried endlessly the way the women stayed in that room the way the bells tolled and the drumsâ<U+0080> the drumsâ<U+0080> the drums the pressure and anticipation of this monumental battle as it crushed down on all these people was immeasurable the show captured maybe for the first time â<U+0080><U+0093>the horrible inflexibility of being trapped trapped on those ships trapped on those walls trapped in that armor in that room on that throne i thought martin did as good of a job as ever in bringing the pressure of the battle up to everyone it was horrible complete total unbearablethe reins of castermere i just thought it was the perfect touch from start to finishthe fall of the king we donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t say it enough on these boards but joff was great this episode stammering scared overwhelmed and a little bitch the whole time give that actor a fucking award i have never believed a king more capable of pissing his pants at the same time he shat himself than that scene the regent and the dove in the books i thought that the cerseisansa scenes during blackwater were as good as anything in that book my favorite i may add and the show did not disappoint cersei determined to spread her anguish and toxicity to sansa sansa playing her part to the letter i felt that helplessness and the desire to kill and hurt the things closest to you even when you are dying yourself cersei is that bitterness that we all know but rarely admit  that when we are in trouble we are capable of scalding those closest to us cersei is the person that chops off her nose to spite her faceand then with tommen and i knew she wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t do it but i still thought there was a chance that â<U+0080> that she would end up the way aerys did â<U+0080> sansa meanwhile was as incredible as always sansa knows what is expected of her she does what will keep her alive and makes sure she plays the part hits the notes makes her marks and survivesthe hound i thought they captured the houndâ<U+0080><U+0099>s rise and fall as well as anything his brutality his killer instinct and then his collapse the fear the fire the anguish and the knowledge that once down you cannot just get back up againthe quarterman another episode another masterpiece by dinklidge this time it was capturing both fear and desperation the whole time we knew tyrion gets to live but it was how he carried himself here that we knew would be the centerpiece of this story no more stupid slapstick with him missing the battle no cut aways no tyrion had to be kneedeep in this shit hole and we got that in spades glad pod was there again thoughwhy so serious iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll end this where i always knew i would by talking about the serious manlook

wretched when shae was on the screen but really this was what the balckwater needed to be 55 minutes of tension buildup climax the blackwater worked in the show for the exact same reasons the blackwater worked in the books because everything that happened we believedmaybe not the best episode maybe not the tightest episode but definitely the most gripping episode edited by rockroi 27 may

"UnknownSoldier",2012-05-27,"was a great episode like i said in the nitpicking thread the only thing i can nitpick about the episode is the way they did the scene on the blackwater the way it played out with the literal creeping doom as the wildfyre spread to the ships and then as everything got crushed up against the chain was one of my favorite scenes in the series while the explosion was cool it just didnt do the scene justice"
"redditdedditrevolver",2012-05-27,"i just love that everyone got some in this episode  tyrion podbronn stannis even lancel whos been emasculated all through this season came off more badass then expected taking an arrow and wanting to get back in and the rains of castemere at the endi usually skip over the songs in the books because i cant make up the tunes in my head just brought it hauntingly to life"

"Frumpus",2012-05-28,"i loved every second of this episode you could really tell grrm wrote it not just from the awesome dialogue and scenes but also the little things like all of the characters brought back that probably would have been cut by other writers we saw both mandon and boros although it looks like they used a stannis soldier instead of mandon to cut tyrion down unless im mistaken i also liked the use of lots of unnamed characters playing roles who was that head archer or the guy who accompanied sandor in the beginning they probably have names or match with minor characters in georges mind its a pity well never know who they really were awesome episode all around"

"erolyn",2012-05-28,"such a good episode i was nervous the whole way through even knowing everything that was going to happen awesome things cersei being a psychopath so good davos as battle commander  and his last yell back to matthos all the shots of the wildfire and ships burning even better than id pictured them in my head everything with bronn especially the brothel scene between him and the hound id watch a whole episode of bronn and the hound everything with tyrion justtyrion sansa was really well fleshed out in this episode and true to her character evolution in the books the one thing i missed was sandors a hound will die for you but never lie to you line i know he says it much earlier in the book but when he didnt a few episodes ago id hoped theyd include it here not a sansan fan just love that line oh well"
"AquariumDrinker",2012-05-28,"that better and more brutal than i anticipated looked wonderful i was hoping the hound would demand sansa to sing him a song and that he would be really drunk and give her his cloak but thats minor we got the point he has a thing for heror is he just a nice guy hahahe gave her his cloak earlier in the season and he hasnt worn it since that i have noticed"

"Onions4all",2012-05-28,"uhmazeing they seriously must have allocated their entire budget to film that episode given the way theyve skimped on battles i did not expect it to be that epic that puts a lot of blockbuster movies to shame combined with the dialog and the fact grrm wrote this episode and preserved everything that was awesome this was one of the best hours of television ever i think my favorite aspect of that episodeand there were many great oneswas stannis leading the charge and showing what a badass he is i think grrm wanted to really illustrate to us since he hadnt really had a chance to do that in the books as much i could watch this episode 3 times in a row as much as i hate the outcome"
"ckal",2012-05-28,"onions4all i agree about grrm and stannis and ive already watched the ep twice im sure ill watch it again tmrw  my brother was so upset after watching it he hates the lannisters well mainly cersei and joffrey he likes tywin and tyrion i havent seen him that upset since ned stark misplaced his head edited by ckal 28 may 2012  1225 am"

"Harrad",2012-05-28," finally if they had just put a little more effort into showing renly in some really unique armor earlier in the season then the arrival of the ghost would have held some weight as it was my father looked at me and said who is this now even after they showed loras and tywin he had no idea loras was wearing renlys armorright was he wearing the antlered crown wihtout reading the books that was unknowable"

"Honey Badger",2012-05-28,"i liked that they used loras for the renlys ghost scene as that always made more sense than using garlan i know martin wanted to be accurate as renly had roberts large build so sticking loras slight body in big green armor wouldnt fit but they could have explained it away painted or tinted some armor green to make a facsimile stuffed the armor with leather or cloth to make it fit something mandon moore was mishandled he very obviously made a go at tyrion and did it in front of witnesses even in the din of battle the books handled the awkwardness of murdering the hand by having it be a private affair on some boats also you cant tell the whitegold armor as none of it stood out besides the helm i could tell since i read the books but i wonder about the noobs everything else was cool i still think they needed the chain as one boat with wildfire shouldnt have been enough to force a landing many ships with wildfire as well as ballista and catapults with the green explosive forced stannis to land along with the chain what they gave us didnt explain the chain away oh well tactically no stannis shouldnt have charged up the ladder you hang back and engage when you think the turning point is come just how tywin does things still badass though the lack of horses sucked during tyrions charge but i guess that was a budget concern the halfmans wedge didnt come to fruition although the chopping at the knee cap was a nice way to make up for it"
"oracle86",2012-05-28,"the battle itself was amazing no chain but blowing up the blackwater more than made up for it the fighting itself was intesne and bloody and they wisely moved stannis to the battlefield in this one i liked how he was incapable of giving a great speech just come with me and take this cityi wouldnt call him incapable of giving a great speech stannis is a direct man i loved the way he said that sentence in such a matteroffact manner"
"No true knight",2012-05-28,"ser dontos still exists hes a terrible juggler heres something subtle check out the scene where joffrey tells mandon moore to represent the king on the battlefield moore nods and they both glance at tyrion in the book its never made clear exactly who sent ser moore after tyrion tyrion thinks its cersei just like the showwriters had joffrey and not cersei give the order to kill roberts bastards it looks like they also had joffrey give the order to kill tyrion in fact joffrey only leaves the battle because he gets cold feet it seems like joffreys original plan might have been to do in his uncle himself with moore providing backup support if things got hectic and then have sansa kiss the bloody sword"

"HouseLark",2012-05-28,"a visceral episode before airing i was concerned that there were no real stakes for viewers since stannis character has been underdeveloped but three characters absolutely saved it tyrion sansa and the hound the stories of those three were so well done that they raised the stakes tyrion has always had a wellwritten story but sansa and the hound have been given scraps really but with blackwater both had solid emotional arcs and the actors both nailed it the hound was especially good to see that fear of the flames and all his courage desert him was incredible i know everyone is banging on about grrm writing this episode and i dont buy the argument that the other writers arent up to scratch but grrm gets sansa and the hound in a way that the other writers dont i should add that i dont give a damn about the sansan thing which i find irritating in the extreme i believe that sansa serves another purpose for the hound their joint story is not about any sort of relationship but i wont go into that here its more of a book discussion theres a few loose ends which will be cleared up next week tywin tyrell mandon moore it would have been great to have this as a twohour season finale and when i watch this back on dvd in the future im sure thats how ill view it excellent"

"legba11",2012-05-28,"watched the scene on hbo go to see if they talk about it they say its renlys armor but oddly the only two ways you could identify it the crown loras is wearing a helm and the gold piece under the neck which is only visible slightly under cloth are not shown renly also wore cloth across his front armor but under the gold piece so you could see it odd choice to do something but make it completely unviewable also odd from watching it closely the stag horns appear much larger in the brief glimpse we have of loras on the battlefield fighting they seem to actually go outside the helm but in the still and in the throne room where he takes it off it appears to just be a small sigil imprinted on the helm on a side note does anyone know how to force a higher resolution on hbo go my goes back and forth from high to low"

"Chelly",2012-05-28,"this was amazing one of the best episodes of the series so far probably the best of the season the wildfire scene was beautiful what was actually happening was horrific but the imagery of the green flames rising on the ships and on the black water was breathtaking lena headey really shown this episode that scene with her and tommen was superb everybody did great this episode for me particularly the characters whose name starts with s sansa sandor stannis and even shae shae has become more likable these past few episodes its a shame we didnt get one or two more scenes between her and tyrion like the one with them in bed this episode it would have helped us understand why tyrion has fooled himself into falling in love with her and cares deeply for her sandor was also at his best fuck the king bowdowngif classbbcemoticon altbowdown  hell yeah the confrontation between him and bronn was great your just like me only smaller  sandor and quicker eh  bronn im aint gonna front though i was expecting a little more from the sansa bedroom scene it was one of my favorite moments in the books but i know it would not have translated well on screen i just thought we would get at least a nonkiss a sort of editing trick to give us a did he or didnt he kiss her like in the books with sansas fuzzy memory maybe that would be too much i know that sansan is not an endgame but i saw the dynamic between them to be more of an important factor in their own personal development and character growth for both sansa and sandor i at least wanted her to touch his face or something to that effect stannis was fucking incredible and unstoppable stephen dillane really brought stannis up a notch in my eyes i loved his reaction to the wildfire my favorite stannis moment was right before they proceed to kl he turns looks at his men looks like he struggles to find something inspiring to say and then goes come with me and take this city lol nowhere near as awesome as tyrions speech but his conviction sold it tyrion was the bomb i loved him sneaking up behind the soldier and cutting him down his fuck me was a line delivered perfectly yay for podrick"
"StarkWard",2012-05-28,"this episode had me crying how can my heart maintain a quick pace of 60 minutes at first i was apprehensive since there was still no blood spilt a quarter into the episode you soon realize that all that buildup had a purpose tyrion once again was a marvel this is his episode as much as it was cerseis some may take issue with the showrunners humanizing tyrion too much but i like him in this episode he was afraid but then it was a time that he was brave as well see what i did there in his most unconventional pep talk he tells the soldiers the truth rather than what they wanted to hear he cuts legs and he pulls off this gasp of whatthefjusthappened when ser mandon attacks him stannis is as straightforward as ever hundereds will die thousands there is really no doubt that stannis is a good war leader fearless and leading in battle a stark contrast to joffrey hiding behind his mothers skirts gleesons facial expressions are refreshing btw and his look of despair while his men force him to fall back struck a cord in peoples hearts sansa and cersei have such a great dynamic it really is great to see cersei slowly geting inebriated like a foreshadowing of her fall from grace in a way shaes presumption that the queen is jealous of sansa rings true because she is a younger more beautiful wouldbe queen headey was fantastic as well as her armour corset cue i should have been a man one second her words send shivers down your spine and the next she is a vulnerable woman as much as we all know her true nature you really cannot deny that cersei loves her children for a second there i was genuinely glad to see loras and tywin i think its amazing that audiences can feel a little romance tingling in the midst of a battle and the sansan dynamic is just that this episode served for sandor as well in seeing his two sides he enjoys killing  he wouldve been quick to prove it in that heartstopping confrontation with bronn but at the same night he offers safety to a terrified sansa inspite of being afraid himself i dont think i have to mention but i will anyway how amazing the far shot of the wildfire explosion is a bit queer though on how davos recognized wildfire in the misty night mind you i now get what dd kept saying about the individual things that happen to people in a war i know this one will be compared to minas tirith but the approach is entirely different you dont just see the troop movements and flanks you get to see the war from all the people involved the soldiers the women the servants the squires everyone down to the last random burning seaman blackwater had too many great lines that it would be a crime to mention any without quoting the whole script its enough to say that the rains of castamere will ring in my head for a fortnight that and druuuums"

"7V3N",2012-05-28,"no one had a problem with it when robert or robb did it or victarion sansa even comments on it and the importance of a king fighting alongside his men is stressed many times by tyrion on the matter of joffrey to prepare us for this scene so to speak it was brilliantly set up really and i loved the juxtapose between joffreys sniveling and stannis badassery jaime too leads from the front in this case it was grrm cleverly showing stannis pragmatism in combat theyve just taken a huge hit their field commander appears to have died his men were showing doubt so stannis decides to lead the charge also surrounded by his own men he was in front but its not like he was way ahead of them much in the same way tyrion decided to lead his men to inspire them it also has something to do with how the battle was adapted here the attack came directly from the sea in the books the army was split in two parts by the river they had to cross to attack the wall and they had great difficulties in getting across it makes more sense for him to lead here where stannis is able to land himself and a large portion of his army relatively securely and there is not an army still behind him that needs directionsim not talking about fighting at the front im talking about being the first the king would be dead if he was the first running towards the walls without even a shield robert was probably the only one and that was robert he was the guy that didnt care if he lived or died in the battle because the battle was what he lived for he was a warrior first"

"Raksha the Demon",2012-05-28,"in my opinion this was the best episode of the season  even without theon whose arc has been outstanding this yeari loved the battle scenes and the moments before and in between the bit between tyrion lancel the silent hound and joffrey where the conversation was going round and round without getting anywhere the old pyromancer yay roy dotrices glee at finally being able to use the wildfire again tyrions simultaneous awe and horror at the results of that wildfire usage the gorgeous shot of bronn setting it off with bow and arrow sansas sweet but catty prayers for joffrey and tyrion especially her reminding joffrey who is trying but failing to humiliate her again how her pretender brother always leads from the front ilyn paynes stare  forget the hound this guy is scary cersei getting more and more drunk and her touching and horrifying scene at the end with tommen on the iron throne about to kill her child before the expected enemies can crash through and put him to the sword and berserker stannis  i dont remember if it was true to the book but his insistence in leading from the front reminded me how singleminded stannis can be i loved it when his men had to drag him kicking and screaming from the battle when it was lost and the arrival of tywin and the lannistertyrell cavalry no one i am now convinced rides a white horse like charles dance as tywin amazing tyrion emulating an angry hobbit and striking his foe in the lower leg not to mention tyrion the whole darned time im a book purist but i dont mind at all if they have him keep his nose peter dinklage is too goodlooking to mutilate onscreenill save my nitpicks for the appropriate thread but i was very pleased with the episode it was tense actionpacked and yet held some great character moments and thank the seven there were no interruptions by daenerys whining about her dragons i do hope we see all three of them next week though edited by raksha the demon 28 may 2012  1151 pm"

"Raksha the Demon",2012-05-29,"show  makes sense with a sansa that wont let herself trust or like a lannister againbook makes sense with a softer sansathey just portray two slightly different evolutions of the character but i believe it was useful in the show because of how sansa has not been portrayed in previous episodes and like mooncat said might help explain her reaction to the forced marriage to viewers because right now tyrion seems like he should be her herothe tv characterization of sansa has not run quite as close to the book as i would like but it is in acok that after tyrion saves sansa from joffreys beatingstripping ordeal and brings her back to his tower and has her washed and medically attended that sansa herself in her thoughts wants to trust tyrion thinking that he seems kind but reminds herself that cersei seemed kind to her too i dont have the book in front of me now she cannot bring herself to trust him or to forget that tyrion is a lannister despite his having shown her some decency and even kindness he is a member of the family that killed her father after promising to be merciful the family that is holding her captive i didnt blame sansa one bit for not trusting tyrion or any lannister the show has also had to make sansa more emotionally immature than she was in the books her foolish behavior and somewhat superficial sheltered outlook on life in the first season is more understandable in an 11yearold child than it is in a 13yearold and in the book she was 12 during the battle of the blackwater tvsansa is supposed to be 14 but looks 18 it doesnt help that the young actress is a tall beautiful girl who is physically maturing quickly sansa was an isolated no shae to trust just the drunken ser dontos abused 12yearold in the book and the best defense she could muster was not to trust any lannister again even one who appeared to be kind and its a pretty good strategy tvsansas distrust of tyrion even after he saved her from joffrey was wellportrayed by sophie turner there is initially fearwariness in her eyes and face when he approaches her and extends his hand unfortunately by the time they get around to marrying tvsansa to tvtyrion the pathos and injustice of marrying a child flowering or no flowering shes not yet 13 young even by westerosi standards and booktyrion said on their wedding night that he desired her even though she is still a child will be lost because sophie turner is a gorgeous teenager who will be 17 or so in real life and not look remotely childish"

"Ghost714",2012-05-29,"does anybody think joffrey or cersei ordered sandor to take out bronn but he desided not to after actually seeing bronn was what he claimed to be a hard man like sandor himself or was sandor just testing bronn for himself trying to see what kind of man he would be fighting with soon or was sandor just wanting to kill someone i could see it being the first option there would be a lot of motive for wanting to take bronn out of the picture in the show he is in charge of the city watch and he actually spends time with the men earning their loyalty also bronn isnt a fraud he is everything he claims to be so even if cersei put someone else officially in charge the men would probably still listen to bronn and think of him as their commandersimilar to skahaz mo kandaq with the brazen beasts in adwd even when demoted he was still in charge of his men so i can see why cersei would see the need to have bronn killed and not just demoted i would like it if that was the case because it would be interesting knowing sandor didnt kill him out of some weird twisted respect for a fellow real killer i loved how bronn got up and didnt back down from sandor while keeping his hand on his knife that scene was so badass bronns knife at his lower back is so cool it just really fits the character and i thought it was a really great touch having bronn shoot the guy on fire running at sandor that was one of those truly great moments in television and this episode was full of moments like that"

"StannisandDaeny",2012-06-01,"i said he got taught the lesson from davosi was definitley saying he respected davos so much he followed his advice to the wall davos knows stannis about as good as anyone who better to judge when he feels like stannis is going to burn the kid than him the third death of joffrey happens and three kings have died of which melisandre foretold and she is preaching to burn him for his kingsblood and davos feels stannis is going to do it and ships him offstannis wasnt going to burn him in fact the only reason davos had time to act is because he was opposed to the idea you think edric would have lived if stannis had wanted to burn him he was vary skeptical on that point and wanted proof the leeches were effective first and even then you cant say he was going to burn him because he never gave the order i suppose if were going to carry this logic we should also lock up everyone who sees a hot girl on the streets and thinks of doing them because hey theyre rapists they didnt do anything but theyre still rapists right after all you dont have to do something or be certain youre going to do something to be guilty of itas for the azor ahai bullshit yeah stannis is not azor ahai duh doesnt mean he cant kick ass you think he doesnt know that the red religion is a means to and end for him nothing more its just a good rallying call it inspires the troops and lightbringer while not more powerful than another sword still carries a reputation see how they melted ice to have a counterpart to it so its just a smart and good move to go along with it even if you dont believe in it robb stark wasnt able to turn into a wolf but the story still spread fear among his enemies garlan tyrell wasnt the ghost of renly but his deception worked as well it worked and thats what matters ever heard the saying the truth is the first casualty of war why do you think stannnis few remaining men still follow him with so much conviction thats where the true power lies edited by stannisanddaeny 01 june 2012  0201 am"

"J_Crews",2012-06-01,"my understanding was hbo signed got for three seasons based off the pilot episode so the budget was set in writing before any ratings were accumulated other than test screenings and such so the deal is the deal if you know what im saying but future seasons will depend on the ratings heavily i think hbo knows they have a show that is tuff to watch only once so there on demand is blowing up the replays and they know it its probably working wonders for bringing along hbogo as wellno they greenlit season 2 after the pilot aired then greenlit season 3 after several of this seasons episodes aired hbo has never to my knowledge greenlit 2 seasons at once of any show and likely never will season 2 also got an increased budget based off of the success of season 1 which has payed off in spades seasons 2s lowestrated episode had more viewers than the highestrate episode from season 1 taken as an average of each week season 2 has seen an increase of over 12 million viewers over the 1st season which was already considered a big success edited by jcrews 01 june 2012  0326 am"

"DurararaFTW",2012-05-28,"i agree that stannis would make a great king but i absolutely cannot agree that he is the rightful king the targaryen empire built the 7 kingdoms and my loyalty will always be to fire and bloodtheyre called the 7 kingdoms because the kingdoms were already well and built and had 7 kings long before the targaryans came along all aegon did was conquer them if daenerys has right to the throne cause aegon defeated everyone then stannis does because robert made everyone bend the knee and swear to serve him as wellbut in the books doesnt it mention that during the greyjoy rebellion stannis was the first one through the castle walli thought i remembered that being mentioned by a character admittedly that was when robert was king and he was just a commander but if thats stanniss personality it makes sense hed try to lead the assault on the gatesthoros of myr and jorah were the first ones over the wall at pyke stannis was busy handing victarion his ass in naval combat and taking wyk"
"Keep Shelly in Athens",2012-05-28,"stannis wanted that stupid city so badlyit was riveting to see i think this throne lusty stannis was an improvement over the books because there he was kind of apathetic about ruling like lawful zombie just following the rules that conveniently benefit him but he never seemed jazzed about it just bored hes so much classier when show mels not around to tempt him with bastard sons that he would never legitimize anyway by his own honor codeahem i worry that they will only have a short time to show stannis camp postdefeat in the next ep which will most likely be jam packed the scene im dying to see in s3 4 is his big epiphany about protecting my kingdom to win my crown that line right there has always made me think that grrm is on team stannis eat it weiss edited by keep shelly in athens 28 may 2012  0220 am"
"Eggplant Wizard",2012-05-28,"another thing they did really well was stannis speech before the battle if you want to call all four words of it a speech he said something like lets go get em  not the most inspiring words ever spoken basically it reinforced what renly said people dont like stannis he isnt inspiring it was such a great character moment"
"Independent George",2012-05-28,"stannis kicking ass was a great addition from the book that was one thing i never got from the books was that he was a great soldier  you heard it but you never saw itbut jeez stannis if you are going to be first off the boat first to the wall and first up the ladder  could you put a freaking helmet onthe helmet thing is the same reason why the nights watch wont wear hats and the pilots in bsg had those ridiculous lights inside their visors  its so viewers can see their faces and react to their emotions i like realism but if its a choice between realism and drama i think you have to go with dramait might be a deviation from the books but we needed to see why people fear stannis until now all we got was gossip from people we gradually came to see his inner strength once he was separated from melisandre but now we got to see the war leader that even tywin was wary of"
"Stannis is the Mannis",2012-05-28,"good topic title also i agree great episode for stannis"

"Honey Badger",2012-05-28,"i dont like stannis or tywin as theyd both be tyrants but honestly stannis as king with tywin as hand would probably be the most potent combination and give everyone the best chance for peace they are both heartless badasses"
"StannisandDaeny",2012-05-28,"its even cooler because grrm wrote it cos now it cant be refuted it came from the writer there is a quote from stannis in the books where he says lightbringer didnt serve me better than any other sword on the blackwater so yes he did fight if not on the battlements then certainly below as his men were retreating i love how unfazed he was by the wildfire prepare to land  great moment followed by hundreds will die my lord thousands how can you not love this guy all hail king stannis"
"Tony Soprano",2012-05-28,"he was great when i saw the preview for the first time i thought it was stupid to portray him as a hotheaded psycho charging along with the rest of the arrow fodder but after seeing the episode i realized hes a great warrior smilepng classbbcemoticon alt first guy up the ladder killing a bunch of lannisters that was so badassand at the beginning of the season i thought stephane dillane wasnt such a good choice for stannis but after watching him in  blackwater   i saw that i was wrong hes a great actor perfect for the role bowdowngif classbbcemoticon altbowdown  hail stannis bowdowngif classbbcemoticon altbowdown "
"StannisandDaeny",2012-05-28,"i never disliked dillane but the writing for him was sometimes a bit off earlier not his fault which had me worried they were gonna cast him like a typical villain lines like i cannot defeat my brother in the field especially how he said it clean doesnt win wars how he sends davos and melisandre after renly instead of cortnay etc had no real place with king stannis but were luckily redeemed by his speech about the siege of storms end one thing i do hope is that they will mention the hillmen killed his scouts somewhere cos that was the reason he wasnt prepared for the lannister  tyrell horde rather than tactical ineptitude"

"The Bastard of Bolton",2012-05-28,"imagine if stannis had melisandre with him how do you guys think the tide of battle could have been turnedim quite sure he would have won in the books as well as in the showit wouldnt have been an honourable victory as it would have been a result of the dark artseven varys brought this to light this episode he wasnt worried about the fleets and all stanniss men he was worried about the magic"
"Dunnii",2012-05-28,"so it seems i may be the only person on this forum who still dislikes stannis i dont care how badass he is he 1 killed his own brother in a very creepy way 2 destroyed statues of gods  ignoring that others may follow those gods 3 hes an insane delusional man  does he really believe hes some kind of god himself hes as crazy as aerys was hes a heartless jerk if you ask me and no amount of going out there first in a battle is going to change that he has no guiltremorsefeelings about sending thousands to their deaths he isnt any different than joffrey who smiles when hearing the screams of men dying in the wildfire call me oldfashioned but i dont want this series to be totally amoral"

varys for reasons known and suspected cannot have stannis on the throne because there is no force as fearsome as a truly just man aqnd when varys talks about sorcery and fear thats all just window

hill or behind the lines no men help me take this city a roarinstantly stannis knew what had to be done no waffling no hesitation no mercy no stopping him first one into the boat when the men cheered him down the ropes he had them the show finally showed us as opposed to telling us â<U+0080><U+0093>that stannis baratheon may be king but he is the best soldier in westeroes and he stood on the prow of that boat easily the most underrated shot flinched his sword in the moonlight as his skiff raced ashore and dared the world to shoot himand now all your love will be exorcisedand we will find you saying its to be harmonizedon the beach heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a leader get his men to the wall stannis is a leader and yes the vast majority of the time stannis would lead from the rear but this is not those times so stannis adaptsin the books stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099> most underrated virtue is his ability to listen to wise counsel over and above his own prejudices and pride stannis can adapt stannis can evolve and so he charges to the beach right into the lions jaws and he spooks a false king the reaction from joff sandor and tyrion was perfect tyrion was afraid and he overcame his fears the hound and joff were afraid and it consumed them and they were afraid of this death coming at them and its leader this implacable force blasting onto their beaches climbing up their walls and battering down their doors and they fear his determination to destroy them alland its an even sumits a melodyits a battle cryits a symphonyat the wall stannis knows a man gets his head caved in a few inches

"The Smiling Eye",2012-05-28,"stannis is in the middle of the honor spectrum he would like to think and his fans would like to think that he is the epitome of honor sorry but that was ned stark can you imagine ned stark using the black arts to kill his younger brother to support his own claim even if it were unassailable still stannis treats davos and some others honorably and is a brave warrior a lot of that can be said for jaime lannister for example who also turns out to be in the middle of the honor spectrumstannis isnt about honor primarily hes about justice sometimes forsaking a portion of honor in order to exact justice is necessary stannis is that"
"Eirikr",2012-05-28,"i know the song dont die with a clean sword references sandors command and thus the lannister side but to me its the theme to stannis and his relentless strength and endurance i admire unyielding ironwilled heroes and stannis is number one nothing would please me more in terms of asoiaf than stannis sitting on the iron throne preferably after having executed theon littlefinger and daenerys i wasnt sold on stephen dillane as stannis in the beginning but this episode settled the matter for me he was fantastic"

"Lion of Red",2012-05-28,"the portrayal of stannis in this episode was awesome whilst it probably wasnt the wisest choice to go first up the ladders it was a pretty badass move and like people have said it suited him up to this i hadnt liked showstannis that much despite liking bookstannis but this episode changed that"
"SerMixalot",2012-05-28,"stannis leading his troops ashore also makes sense from the standpoint that the show removed the land based portion of his forces the only forces he has are on the ships"

"DurararaFTW",2012-05-28,"yeah it was kinslaying treason mean death and what renly did was definitely treason no matter if joffrey was roberts blood or not would it have more noble of stannis if he butchered everybody else but spared renly solely cause he is his brother like they make clear half a hundred times this episode stannis was gonna kill tyrion cersei and all the lannisters too it wasnt like i always hated my brother so im gonna kill him stannis will kill anyone that betrays the kingdom if tyrion varys and cersei know stannis well enough to understand this then you can bet your ass renly did he knew exactly what he was getting himself into and he laughed at the prospect"

"Eirikr",2012-05-28,"renly made the conscious decision to betray his older brother and usurp his throne in violation of both morality and the rule of law in light of that stannis would be entirely justified in ceasing to consider renly his brother renly forfeited the right to kinship so to speak if not for renlys actions the houses sworn to house baratheon would have been united and likely victorious against king joffrey and the lannisters hence joffrey cercei pycelle and numerous others would be put to justice for their crimes against the seven kingdom and house stark sansa would be reunited with robb and tywin would most likely be apprenhended or at least prevented from arranging the red wedding robb would be able to move his host back north towards winterfell and deal with the greyjoys  boltons and king stannis would have the resources to truly fortify the wall  the nights watch against the others all in all im pleased that the deceitful renly died a horrible death it couldnt have happened soon enough edited by eirikr 28 may 2012  0200 pm"

"Songlian",2012-05-28,"this thread manages to express my level of fangirlism perfectly"
"Harrad",2012-05-28,"renly was incorrect as proven by the fact that thousands supported stannis as king at the battle of blackwater enough to outnumber king joffreys men five to one if i recall correctlyexcept all the loyal renley troops switched to the hated lannisters just to get back at stannis and they were enough with tywin to boot stannis out of town"
"Ramsay Gimp",2012-05-28,"i think another important difference between ned and stannis is that stannis doesnt suffer many illusions he knows that he is hated by many he knows how many of his bannermen think and what they will say before they say it he knows after the blackwater that his chances arent that good but he still chooses to do things his own way damn the consequences he isnt surprised by the treachery of others with the possible exception of renly because that hits so close to home"
"Winterfell is Burning",2012-05-28,"thats why this battle is so good on a narrative level our beloved tyrion sansa sandor and bronn are being attacked by the ruthless rebel stannis but oh wait joffrey and cersei are on their side too and stannis may be a just man but he deals with black magic and other amoral activities and both sides see robb as a traitor there is no good guy here which makes this battle much more interesting than those between starks and lannisters where its pretty obvious who the audience will root forabout the part in bold he isnt the rebel the audience knows he is speaking the truth when he says hes roberts rightful heir which of course adds another level of ambiguity to it"
"salt",2012-05-28,"except all the loyal renley troops switched to the hated lannisters just to get back at stannis and they were enough with tywin to boot stannis out of townis that why they switched sides during the battle it seems like the 80000 lannistertyrells surprising their flank and slaughtering them from behind might have also provided a small incentive to surrenderno doubt many of the stormland men wished they were fighting for renly instead of stannois but if they were simply looking for any opportunity to get back at stannis they would have just left with the tyrells rather than ever joining him"

"StannisandDaeny",2012-05-29,"in medieval times it was common for poorer lords with fewer men at their command to fight kings would also fight if the situation was dire and it was dire seeing as his field commander had just been taken out theres always a chance an arrow will hit you but that chance is always small it wasnt like he was running 3 metres ahead of everyone as for going up the ladder first the wall was hit where the defences were weakest  you could easily see there wasnt space on the battlements for a large number of men to await the defenders there wasnt even enough space to get a good surround he faced 2 vs 1 odds at most and stannis as almost any man trained from childhood to be a knight and then a lord would be is going to be more skilled than random militia  menatarms it wouldve been a different story if he had happily been cutting away armourplastered heavy knights but i dont think this was as unrealistic as people are making it out to be the fighting was in fact very realistic ive mentioned it before but ill say it again the choreographer did an amazing job getting the actors to display medieval techniques caesar and alexander the great would be other examples of reallife commanders who also fought in the end i can just bring it down to this stannis is a bamf and haters gonna hate edited by stannisanddaeny 30 may 2012  0215 am"

"Darth Rivers",2012-07-01,"in medieval times it was common for poorer lords with fewer men at their command to fight kings would also fight if the situation was dire and it was dire seeing as his field commander had just been taken out theres always a chance an arrow will hit you but that chance is always small it wasnt like he was running 3 metres ahead of everyone as for going up the ladder first the wall was hit where the defences were weakest  you could easily see there wasnt space on the battlements for a large number of men to await the defenders there wasnt even enough space to get a good surround he faced 2 vs 1 odds at most and stannis as almost any man trained from childhood to be a knight and then a lord would be is going to be more skilled than random militia  menatarms it wouldve been a different story if he had happily been cutting away armourplastered heavy knights but i dont think this was as unrealistic as people are making it out to be the fighting was in fact very realistic ive mentioned it before but ill say it again the choreographer did an amazing job getting the actors to display medieval techniques caesar and alexander the great would be other examples of reallife commanders who also foughtin the end i can just bring it down to this stannis is a bamf and haters gonna hatewell the medieval techniques werent all that accurate since chainmail cannot be pierced by hand weapons even couched lances and point blank crossbows have difficulty with that its only disadvantage to plate is the need for thick padding also menatarms were no less armored than knights as for real life examples stannis strikes me as a henry v not the shakespearean version but the real deal hes got lots of experience since his youth he is dedicated to his goals and he doesnt shy away from the thick of fighting in the books he was cut off from the walls by wildfire in the river but likely fought the lannistertyrell horde as he was forced to retreat eta it just struck me stannis is leading a starving demoralized and disintegrating army while a strong force of enemies is approaching the battle for winterfell will be stanniss agincourt edited by darth rivers 01 july 2012  0602 am"
"Vandalism",2012-07-01,"stannis the mannis baratheon for king stannis for the win this guy is just radiating badassery all the time i absolutely loved how he fought in the blackwater and the only scene he had that i disapprove of was the choking of melisandre"
"Rockroi",2012-07-01,"i do not think stannis will ultimately prevail i think that dany and her dragons and stannis ultimate hatred for the targs and the fact that he was going to kill her make it hard for him to prevail against that type of opponent as i stated before i think stannis will attack the others as king and in doing do preserve the realm long enough for dany et al to actually beat back the night i hope stannis gets the opportunity to go out on an honorable and just blaze of glory"
"KnightOfDragonstone",2012-07-01,"i agree that it was awesome and i think stannis is the rightful and best king for westeros but i cant help but feel that him charging in as an action hero just makes him seem like somoene who would be a worse king he should be a clever and cunning military strategist who stayed back to give orders and be able to improvise with his charge it proves that he is no coward though edited by knightofdragonstone 02 july 2012  0901 am"
"TheCasualObserver",2012-07-02,"adwd spoilers im ashamed to admit but it took me a while before i actually started liking stannis i was outraged originally when renly was killed  it was such a surprise from a series where magic has played such a small part to see magic kill off a main character and after the blackwater i assumed stannis was finished and didnt think much more of it but the more i read the books the more my appreciation for him grows in one episode of the series he explains why he was compelled to kill renly with the shadow  his younger brother used his popularity to gain a crown while stannis could rely only on his right as the elder brother to rule he held storms end for a year ate rats when the food ran out nearly starved alongside his men and would have were it not for davos seaworth he suffered through all this but at the end of the seige storms end was taken from him and given to renly who hadnt fought for it hadnt starved for it hadnt done or achieved anything to warrant it yet stannis obeyed he gave up his seat and went to dragonstone like the leal lord he was his brother snubbed him but stannis did nothing because robert was his king and elder so he had the right of it and obeyed but then robert dies his children the product of incest with his wife and brotherinlaw stannis knows it is his time to rule but in spite of this his younger brother renly again takes what should be his  the loyalty of the reach and the stormlands unlike any other king in the war of the five kings stannis has payed his dues  robb was just a lord seeking vengence balon greyjoy was a brutal rebel seeking glory joffrey was an entitled asshat renly took his crown on a whim because his boyfriend told him to stannis is alone in having suffered for the throne can you really blame him for what he does to renly the culmination of a decade of resentment towards his younger brother who spits in his eye again when he declares himself kingit wasnt really out of character for stannis  he did show remorse afterward but this really was the only way stannis could possibly begin his rule and stannid will do what is necassary when stannis lost at the blackwater he saw his forces reduced to practically nothing just the two thousand he had left at the start of his campaign the whole world seemed to conspire against him  if edmund tully had allowed tywin lannister to cross the river stannis would be sitting on the throne if someone less gifted than tyrion had been in control of kings landing he still could have taken the city in time for the lannistertyrell attack if he had brought mel with him he might have killed petyr baelish before a pact was made between lion and rose but nothing went right and he was forced to flee then in his darkest moment he sailed for the wall and resuced the kingdom from the wildlings before they could breach it now he marches on winterfell seeking to claim at least one of the seven kingdoms back stannis and stannis alone is the man to rule the 7 kingdoms dont get comfortable tommen euron aegon and dany he aint finished yet"

"echidna",2013-07-25,"i agree that stannis would make a great king but i absolutely cannot agree that he is the rightful king the targaryen empire built the 7 kingdoms and my loyalty will always be to fire and bloodbut stanniss grandmother was a targaryen so hes the only king involved in the war who is notably targaryen at the time of blackwaterhaving a targaryen grandparent wa s a notable part of roberts right to the iron throne he was the oldest male leader of the victors with the right heritagestannis being male has more right to the iron throne than danerys under the westerosi rules of succession edited by echidna 25 july 2013  0722 am"
"Nedmight",2013-07-04,"this is something i dont understand completely while in harrenhal tywin was talking about going after robb in the night and decided to ride out with his soldiers then all of a sudden he shows up at the battle of blackwater bay with house tyrell how did it go from a night raid to saving kings landing was this a trick to keep it secret from potential spies i understand that it was meant to be a surprise for the viewer but it was actually a bit confusing no book spoilers please"
"echidna",2013-07-25,"he appeared to be having two conversations at once one about going to a battle and another one about robbs actions if you rewatch the scene you can pick out the 2 different things its a common way to confuse the reader that agatha christie used a lot i missed it the first time too my guess is that tywin was discussing going to kings landing and then he was asked about robb stark which is where we started seeing the conversation edited by echidna 25 july 2013  0647 am"
"Dementia",2012-05-27,"since they really havent set up ser dontos are nonbook readers understanding why sansa didnt go with the hound by the end of the conversation its obvious shes not afraid of him anymore it didnt seem like she thought it was a cerseijoffrey trick is anyone even thinking about it"
"Khal-a-bunga",2012-05-28,"i dont know maybe because the hound is a brutal killer and she is a teenage girl if i were in her shoes i wouldnt be too keen on traveling thousands of miles with that dude either the dontos subplot can easily be pushed to next season and id bet well be seeing a bit more of him in the finale"

"HouseLark",2012-05-28,"yeah sansa refusing the hounds offer is difficult to explain without dontos plot oh well i guess even grrm isnt perfect"
"King Rickon",2012-05-28,"you think its difficutl to explain why a young shallow and scared teenaged girl wouldnt run off with a drunken misfigured killer i mean just the fact that theyd have to walk out of the red keep in the middle of a war is reason enough to not go and up until this point shes been terrified of him so i cant see what would have to happen for her to grab his drunk hand and run off into the middle of a city on fire with him"
"Frumpus",2012-05-28,"i almost thought it was moon boy at first but then i remembered it was dontos so glad that he got to show up again and you have to leave it to grrm to remember his characters i bet in the hands of another writer this episode would have been dontosfree"
"Soiled Septa",2012-05-28,"hbo may have purposely put that scene after the blackwater episode for a few reasons 1 littlefinger ends up as the mastermind behind dontos rescue of sansa 2 it seems that littlefinger returns to kings landing in the finale 3 the nonreaders do not realize the level of scheming littlefinger is capable of 4 viewers may call bullshit if dontos reaches out to sansa while littlefinger is away"
"Dunnii",2012-05-28,"i think martin set up the fact for tv viewers that sansa didnt go by having cersei tell her about the people who ran during the battle and she had their heads chopped off maybe she was just too scared to go its possible cersei would not chop off her head but it could have been a part of her fear edited by dunnii 28 may 2012  1133 am"
"towerofjoy",2012-05-28,"sansa is basically told she is better off with stannis in control and would likely survive the sack as long as she stays put with the hound it would seem much more uncertain"

"heathergalaxy",2012-05-28,"it seemed to me that sansa was betting that stannis would take the city and shed be safeâ however i bet when she sees that the lannisters keep on keeping on that she will wish that she had taken the hound up on his offer and then goes along with ser dontos because she doesnt want to miss another chance of getting out i think it makes total sense why she wouldnt want to go just yet"
"Lord Godric",2012-05-28,"ser dontos was in the episode juggling in maegors holdfast so i was surprised they didnt use him more i wouldnt be surprised if his rescue promise was in the next episodei was thinking that they would wait until next season because to have this ill rescue you plot waiting around for two whole seasons assuming we dont even see joffreys death next season might be dragging it out for way too long but it would be a good way to end the season for sansa"
"NomadicDirewolf",2012-05-28,"a viewer probably understands the reasons why sansa didnt go with the hound at the time it was mentioned repeatedly that stannis would not harm her and as it says in the books hed send her back to catelyn so its a safer more direct route to home without the hound whod be difficult to share the road with given his violent nature and his lack of protection from any side in the war of the five kings and stannis victory looked all but certain at that point"

"never trust a bard",2012-05-29,"im not sure dontos is even going to be part of her escape i was thinking they might just get to the point and let littlefinger rescue her they seem to be cutting out some serious middlemen this season and combining storylines that seems like an easy place to snip"
"Mulled Wino",2012-05-29,"i dont think they had time to fit that storyline in yet no biggie theres plenty of time later"
"Darth Vader's Bastard",2012-06-01,"there can be only so many characters especially on a tv show before it becomes overwhelming they already introduced so many new characters for season 2 i dont really expect ser dontos to be a part of the show"
"Reposado",2012-06-02,"i think its part of the some arcs are better left confined to a season style this would fit having sansa meet with dontos can wait till lf is back in kl theyve already cast him and established him as a presence in the red keep they need someone to coax sansa to leave so why wouldnt they use a character that both does this in the books and is kicking around on the show theyve got to get her to the vale somehow they need to get more use out that eyrie set"
"Dunnii",2012-06-02,"this thread confuses me dontos is in the very first scene in the first episode of season 2 and sansa saves his life seems to me he will enter her life soon right"

"Reposado",2012-06-03,"dontos really isnt needed here its just as believable to have littlefinger holding the reins on the whole plot without including the dontos informationit isnt needed but theyve already cast him why if just for the one scene have they casted anyone with less of a role than that"

"heathergalaxy",2012-06-08,"based on the last episode my guess is that since sansa rightly doesnt trust littlefinger with her true feelings that theyll have the ser dontos plot to get her out of there probably after she marries tyrion and then sansa can be again rightly horrified that littlefinger was behind it"
"Myrcella",2012-08-25,"i think sansa will escape with littlefinger straight away the last we see of sansa in e10 is baelish requesting to escape sansa she reluctantly refuses and then littlefinger says the same line clegane said in the book something about everyone being liars and being better than her"

"Zappotack",2012-06-02,"i think it was cersei who ordered the attack its been shown over and over her rage toward tyrion about myrcella and regarding joffrey fighting and joffrey was terrified and left command to tyrion so theres no reason for joffrey to have him executed at that time"
"Lord Varys",2012-06-02,"as in the books the assassination attempt on tyrion is still a riddle grrm did not give us more hints in his script than he did in the book in fact the way joffy was portrayed in blackwater strongly indicates that he was not behind ser mandon and cersei well she actually confirms that she is not behind it when she drunkenly says to sansa if my wretched brother prevails if cersei had ordered tyrions death she would be damn sure he would not survive the battle and considering cerseis chapters in affc and adwd it is save to say that she had nothing to do with it at least in the books which would leave the usual suspects 1 varys who would have littleno motive neither in the books nor in the show since in both its somewhat indicated that he intends to recruit tyrion into his camp 2 joffrey technically he would have a motive but it feels not alright and it would also cause a problem to reveal the truth since now both joffrey and ser mandon are dead 3 littlefinger he is the likeliest candidate for a number of reason he is the only one with a possible connection to moore both are from the vale of arryn he is the one character who wants to get rid of tyrion after he came back alive from the vale and knows that he was behind that dagger thing thats why littlefinger chose tyrion as scapegoat for joffreys murder and its also his confirmed modus operandi to have people killed while he himself is not present 4 ser mandon acted alone feeling that this hand of the king posed a threat to his king actually the way its shown in the series this may actually be quite likely and it would still be a possibility in the books as well but i concur that this was poorly set up in the series they should have introduced the kg and ser mandon to the audience earlier and they should also have shown us about this littlefingertyrionenmity by say show us tyrion investigating littlefingers affairs as master of coin or littlefinger complain to ros about this new dwarf hand instead of this stupid pimpintimidatesprostitutescene"

"Arkash",2012-05-29,"i agree i think too he will be the one to fish up davos"
"Greywolf2375",2012-05-29,"yeah if they dont have him finding davos floating or out on the little islets its almost pointless to have introduced him at all and with the way he languishs in luxury and counsels davos i would miss that"
"LÂ<U+0092>Age dÂ<U+0092>or",2012-05-29,"i think he will have a larger role in the aftermath of the defeat since he will probably be the one taking stannis back to dragonstone and effectively stannis fleet admiral while as others mentioned there is a high chance he saves davos as well additionally stannis is in his debt so im pretty sure he will play even a bigger role in the future than he has in the books"

"Reposado",2012-05-29,"yeah should have been mentioned but it should have been last episode or the one before just a quick scene with saan mad at davos for putting him in the rear because he will miss the best plunder would be a nice character note and an explanation of why he isnt in this episode when we had that scene of davos convincing him to go to kl"
"Tadco26",2012-05-29,"i think it was an awkward situation that grrm decided to avoid addressing personally since the previous writers made davos leader of the attack and in the books davos notes that it was foolish for ser imry florent not to use salidor and his extremely experienced sea men but instead keeping them as a rear guard because he didnt trust them"

"Raging Throner",2012-10-19,"tyrion in the book and on the show is not devulging too much information to cersei and tywin spoiler plus tyrion is not on the council anymore and will be gone from kl soon it is also difficult to show varys reach as a spy without making it seem as though he knows everything going on in the realm"

"Caro99",2012-05-27,"gosh i was literally unable to speak after the episode ended and sansan wow i was in shock trying to decide if i liked her going with him or not but then the preview for next week crush that ok so about a future between them i am a devoted sansan shipper and want them to be together against all odds in the end 3 it was sad we didnt have the song or the unkiss moment or her cupping his cheek i think we can still have her hugging his cloak next week i cant recall if he was wearing any but i loved how they both acted and the face of sandor as he wants to make her realize that all men are bad i think the fact that after he says this and calls robb and ned killers we dont see sansa calling him horrid but instead daring to trust him speaks volumes and i liked how george clarified that sandor did indeed thought of taking sansa to winterfell i like what ran said about how the show is one thing the books another and george may not have been allowed to write the moment like he wanted but cause it justifies my future clinging to the belief that these 2 are bound to meet again i can see sansa in an upcoming scenario where she is either alayne stone or a sort of queen in the north unable to trust anyone and then sandor appears after the quiet isle and she remembers how he said he would not harm her oh well i writing this from my phone so ill come back tomorrow with a clearer head smilepng classbbcemoticon alt "
"Fragile Bird",2012-05-27,"caro99 as i said i hope rans right because i was so looking forward to the tension in that scene and the song for sandor and the dropped cloak while sansa is surprised to see sandor there you dont have the fear factor from the book and while sandor is drinking hes still appears more or less sober and i do hope this is just a matter of time constraints"
"towerofjoy",2012-05-27,"i think sansa symbolized innocence to sandor and because he lost his very early he alternates between hating her innocence and wanting to protect it i dont think it was sexual at all on his part sansa is always looking for her florian sandor and tyrion dont really fit the bill but always save her from others like joff seemed to initially she has been in a desperate situation since neds death  and is likely looking for a protector more in the model of a father than lover"
"Tourniquet",2012-05-27,"i think that in subsequent seasons she can imagine a remembrance of the scenario that didnt happen at all she might mention that she sang to him and he tried to kiss her when none of that happens it will be even more of a fabrication of the truth in the show"

"Kittykatknits",2012-05-28,"why ive no idea but i have a theory or two in any case these missing elements dont necessarily mean that anything is dead i mean how can a relationship turn on one scene like that theres enough there that you can maybe sorta see something in the futureany chance you would share those theories id love to hear your thoughts on itthe scene between the two of them makes sense when i consider the changes that have been made to their storyline this season im disappointed about the entire s2 arc between them so this episode doesnt really matter all that much to me i didnt expect much to begin with i dont understand why she did not go with him though in the books it made sense but that doesnt translate to the tv show he outright stated that he would take her home keep her safe and not hurt her she even acknowledges this fact her reasoning seems to be that stannis and his men wont hurt her that strikes me as rather weak that portion made no sense to me at alli dont think sansan is dead or over there is an active sansan thread over in the books section in the forum with lots of really good reasons why they are likely to meet again in the books if the only characterplot change the show made was to the relationship between sandor and sansa then i would be worried but that isnt the case at all as we have changes to danys storyline a huge change to jons that has resulted in changes to his character changes to robbs a weakening of catelyns character and whitewashed tyrion the differences between the books and the show were bigger this season than they were in the first and i expect that to continue going forwardso i dont think we can predict future events in the books based on the tv show which i am very glad about the books are my canon i enjoy the show in some respects but its a pale imitation to what i really love  the books seriessansan isnt dead for me at all ill stubbornly cling to hope until the last page of the last book im a sucker that way edited by kittykatknits 28 may 2012  0756 am"

"ZenderZill",2012-05-28,"i think in the series theyre focusing on the long term character development of sansa in a general sense throughout all of joffreys cruelty drunk cersei scaring her sandortyrion later looking out for her littlefingers schemes etc its all about her growing into a hardened woman she starts the first book as a complete idealist thinking that beautiful knights are honorable queens are gracious and that imps and monsters are evil her character arc over all the books is about her going from being a shallow little girl to an understanding woman worthy of being catelyn and neds daughter i think theyre sticking to it quite well in the show and in particular in this episode they did it exceptionally"
"jons nissa",2012-05-28,"if the only characterplot change the show made was to the relationship between sandor and sansa then i would be worried but that isnt the case at all as we have changes to danys storyline a huge change to jons that has resulted in changes to his character changes to robbs a weakening of catelyns character and whitewashed tyrionbut those are all character changes or modifications a relationship change would be a major plot change however since robbtylisa and dany are still up in the air i may change my tune after next weeks episode i doubt it though from all the side glances tylisa throws i still expect her to be part of the plan to destablize robb and i expect dany to still have enough of a khalasar to move on withas for what is shown to transpire between sandor and sansa it appears to portray it as a type of friendship that benefitted both of them and as the only friend she has that has always looked out for her well being and tried to help her recognize what is happening around her i have no doubt they will meet again the hound has shown that he genuinely cares about sansa in both the series and the books and sansa learns to see the hounds true worth as a person and as knight in both the series and the books but there doesnt seem to be any hints of romance at all on the show which is made with an understanding of where the story will eventually wind up make of that what you will"

"brashcandy",2012-05-28,"it exists to exploit the whole white knight saving the princess trope but not to the extent that there is an intent for a romance its more to teach sansa that there is more to a person than how they look cute joffrey is a bastard and ugly sandor is somewhat chivalrous thats it i think the show is doing a better job drawing those lines than perhaps the books may have however in the books you never get a physical attraction reaction from sansa during any of her pov chapters when she is interacting with the hound she just doesnt feel at all for him like some here hope and implyhuh as the books are actually what martin wrote and with the show devolving into ridiculously bad fan fiction i think ill take my cue from the former doing so one cannot miss reading sansas thoughts later on when she and the hound are separated thinking of him climbing into her bed and kissing her we dont get a physical reaction from her because most of her thoughts on it seem to be somewhat subconscious and she doesnt crush on the hound as she does with loras tyrell for instancei think the show missed a great opportunity last night to create some suspense and mystery concerning sansas decision to go with the hound and whether the unkiss really happened  if indeed theyre going to reference this in later seasons as hes walking out they could have had her say wait the effect of this being that we would not have known until next wk that she didnt go with him and we would not have known precisely how they parted meaning that a kiss could have taken placeah well to come back to fragile birds question in the op no sansan is not dead and buried its just been fucked with"

"Caro99",2012-05-31,"hmmm christina i think you may be on to something here maybe sansa was going to go with him after she gives him that lingering beautiful look when she states he wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t hurt her but just then sandor realized that he shouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t make such a promise cause harm may come to her if she leaves with him whether itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s thanks to him or for other reason so he decided to go away iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m sure he knows staying alone in kl with joff for company isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t safe but maybe since there is some sexual attraction in there he realized he could end up being a danger to her innocence or somethingâ<U+0080> but i like this theory cause it both makes sandor a man who is willing to sacrifice his wishes for the wellbeing of the little bird and it also makes sansa for nonbook readers less â<U+0080><U+009C>foolishâ<U+0080><U+009D> for not going away with himjuliads unfortunately they donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t meet again after he leaves her room for at least the next 3 books but there is a popular theory going around that his hound identity died but sandor is still alive in a sort of westesori rehabilitation centerâ<U+0080> iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m not sure how much i should say if you have not read the books but if s3 ends or includes a certain major event where he and arya are concerned then we may very well see him in s4 as well aww poor nonbook readers who think she did elope with him iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m sure that even if i had not read the books by now i would definitely be intrigued by sansan and would be just like this lot lol i mean iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve read the books more than once and i still for a moment felt convinced that the show had changed their storylines so she could run away with him i know it was mad since it would mean a lot of important future plot changes but until we got the preview for next week i was stunned into believing this dunnogif classbbcemoticon altdunno  silly me blushinggif classbbcemoticon altblushing "

"Valkyrja",2012-05-31,"juliads while sansa and sandor have yet to meet up again in the book series keep in mind that the book series is still unfinished at this point so there is a chance they may meet up again i do not believe that sandor is dead his persona of the hound may be but i feel that he is alive and in hiding whether or not he reappears in the story well just have to see nevertheless despite the fact that neither of them have seen each other again since the night at the blackwater both characters in the books seem to think of one another a great deal sansa thinks of sandor in almost all of her subsequent chapters either comparing other men to him wishing that he were still there wrapping herself in his cloak misremembering the night of the blackwater until she thinks for sure that he kissed her in the books he nearly does so the mismemory is slightly more understandable and finally in her later chapters she even has a fairly risque dream some say its a nightmare that includes sandor climbing into her bed sandor for his part rather frequently mentions the pretty little bird that he seems to regret leaving in kings landingat least it stands out as fairly frequently coming from him of all people some say that sansan shippers just magnify the importance of such remembrances but i say that this is clear and present in the text and at the very least regardless of any sexual or romantic undertones the characters continued thoughts about each other signify just how much the complicated relationship meant to each of them whether they ever meet up again or not sandor continues to play a part in the story after this point so we should expect to see him around in the hbo series for at least the next season hopefully the next two seasons smilepng classbbcemoticon alt "
"Kittykatknits",2012-05-31,"nevertheless despite the fact that neither of them have seen each other again since the night at the blackwater both characters in the books seem to think of one another a great deal sansa thinks of sandor in almost all of her subsequent chapters either comparing other men to him wishing that he were still there wrapping herself in his cloak misremembering the night of the blackwater until she thinks for sure that he kissed her in the books he nearly does so the mismemory is slightly more understandable and finally in her later chapters she even has a fairly risque dream some say its a nightmare that includes sandor climbing into her bed sandor for his part rather frequently mentions the pretty little bird that he seems to regret leaving in kings landingat least it stands out as fairly frequently coming from him of all peoplesome say that sansan shippers just magnify the importance of such remembrances but i say that this is clear and present in the text and at the very least regardless of any sexual or romantic undertones the characters continued thoughts about each other signify just how much the complicated relationship meant to each of themsandor speaks of her with a surprising amount of emotion when we consider who he is i thought it was rather sad and sweet when he spoke of her giving him a song with such pride his despair when he learned of her marriage was very powerful tooi think there is a good chance we will see him for the next two seasons actually if the two big weddings are split amongst seasons as i think they will be"
"WinterWarrior",2012-05-31,"i dont agree that he withdrew his offer i think she refused him i am a big supporter of sansan and think they will get together some day and he will die protecting her or rescuing her from something at some point i think the hbo sansan scene that martin wrote in blackwater stands alone and should not be clouded by the book scene i think it is totally about sansa coming into her own and into womanhood leaving childhood behind she is in the middle of her first flowering she handled being cooped up with the women during the battle better than cersei did she is back in her room thinking she is safe and stannis is winning and will soon liberate her and then there is the hound sansa stands her own does not seem to be afraid of him after a while and says no to this very powerful man he respects that and leaves i think the fact that he does not touch her or come on to her in a sexual way empowers her to a certain extent it is one of the few times during her captivity at kl that she can say no and it means something someone powerful listens even though the hound is powerful in a physical way not royal power she lets go of her doll in that scene as she lets go of victimhood and childhood in my opinon i think her words i know you will not hurt me speaks volumes about her sense of self and the fact that there is a bond of trust that she has with him this is setting us up for some later sansan event in the future i do believe he is in love with her and she is drawn to him edited by winterwarrior 31 may 2012  0747 am"
"Valkyrja",2012-05-31,"winterwarrior i think you make an excellent observation and a very interesting interpretation thank you for sharing smilepng classbbcemoticon alt  i agree that hbo sansa has refused the offer it is easy to get mixed up if we think about the books here but booksansa does not outright refuse the hound bookhound is much more emotionally unstable and incredibly drunk at this point and from what i understand of that scene he thinks she is refusing the offer and basically leaves before she really has a chance to process what has happened i agree that theyve given hbo sansa more agency in this scene which fits given that she is older in the show and it also fits in more with the characterization of these two characters in the show hbohound is less scary and physically agressive towards sansa hbosansa is older and less frightened especially during the blackwater episode where she seems to come into her own as much as i would have loved to have seen the book scene come to life it was just completely unrealistic as the characterization of sansa and the hound in the show is different enough at this point that it would not have worked to do the scene from the book at this point i am just so glad they kept that scene in at all it definitely had viewers and reviewers talking about sansan in a way that i did not expect smilepng classbbcemoticon alt "
"Woman of War",2012-05-31,"i am suggesting a mindgame here imagine you only and definitely only have seen hbo and be honest about it and then imagine sandor were gay i know he isnt no need to convince me i think his actions towards sansa in s2 so far would all be the same if he had acted out of basic human compassion honesty and the sincere wish to help apart from somewhat liking that girl and he expresses those emotions as far as a damaged personality like sandor is able to express them would he express them differently if he only had a fatherly concern would his kindness towards sansa have taken any other shape than it does here in hbo if he had no sexual interest in her because for example he might be gay only as mindgame here i believe there might have been exactly the same exchanges between them exactly the same kindness towards her if we assume there is no erotic tension and it is well possible that martin having written this episode is perfectly aware of it he consciously left out the rapey undertones and the idea of a kiss which logically does ot mean that there will never be any erotic attraction but so far there is none given by the hbo script so my point is there are no erotic undertones to feel in this episode only concern from sandors side or are there any"
"Valkyrja",2012-05-31,"just because the eroticromanticsexual undertones were not included from the book does not mean that none were conveyed even if accidentally ive seen plenty of reviews from nonbook readers saying that it seemed to them that the hound had special feelings for sansa i think that is one thing that cannot be denied herewhether in the books or in the show it is not just basic human compassion that makes sandor care for sansa during their time together at kings landing there are other people who are in states of distress at various times take lollys for example during this time that he did not help sandor is attracted to sansa for who she is and wants helping her from very early on whether this attraction is fatherly sexual romantic etc  none of the above or a strange combination is thus far left to the interpretation of the reader smilepng classbbcemoticon alt "
"Woman of War",2012-05-31,"yes the attraction is special no doubt maybe sansa represents his lost childhood maybe his last chance of return into humanity maybe his wish to finally do something right maybe sexual desire in the books he has grossly botched that situation and sansa herself was of course aware of the threat to her life with the knife on her throat but she was ot aware of the danger of getting raped she merely expected a kiss about that she had heard in her stories about everything else she knew nothing whereas hbo sansa had not only nearly been raped in the streets she had heard about rape all day long and would have recognized that kind of threat straightaway the plotline could not be written the same way and so everything is open to different interpretations in episode 9 so far sandor has done much better no sexual approach i am as well convinced that the two characters will meet again and that this might be the real test what sandor has made of his life you cannot compare sansa to lollys because sandor in the books expressly states that he hates cripples and the weak like lollys and tyrion this is indeed a very ugly side of him distinguishing between the weak who are worthy of his concern like especially sansa and those mishappen who are scum to him like lollys and tyrion the quality of special that sansa represents to him is imo open here could he always within the hbo script feel the same wish to help a say ten year old innocent wonderful and goldenhearted boy who gets tortured and abused and who might represent the child sandor would have wanted to be or not edited by woman of war 31 may 2012  1135 am"
"Valkyrja",2012-05-31,"sorry your are right lollys was a bad example but was the only one i could think of off the top of my head regarding if sansa were a boy would he still care for her in a special wayi really have no idea i dont understand the need to play mind games with this issueyes stepping back and looking at things from different perspective is always good nevertheless im hardly going to change my mind about liking sansan just because i am imagining for a second that the hound is gay winkpng classbbcemoticon alt  i stand by my belief that the sexualviolent aspect of their relationship was toned down for the tv show because it might make sandors character much less sympathetic to tv audience and it would probably be extremely uncomfortable for the actors portraying these characters despite being aged up for the tv series the age gap between hbo hound and sansa is even wider than in the books i think they set out from the beginning to tone down the character of the hound so that hardly any of his intense scenes with sansa would need to happen the way they do in the books"
"Woman of War",2012-05-31,"well i guess that way martin has taken himself the freedom to do with that relationship whatever he wants in the future without having it burdened with something definite already you can put much more subtlety into a written story than into the less ambigous medium movie in a book things are open to interpretation whereas in a show like that they are done or not and images can have an impact that cannot be taken back in cinema its all about looks that are exchanged and these special looks i am missing here and dont get me wrong i am a movie addict"

"Woman of War",2012-11-17,"le cygne all your quotes are from the books and far more advanced thatn the series are at that point i think it is well possible that grrm may keep the general direction that sandor wants to be more than sansas protector after all this mixture of protectiveness and outright sexual violence with a knife at her throat and explicit thought of rape is hugely interesting and adds important facets to the character sandor actually without his infatuation with sansa and his travel with arya the character sandor would be quite pointless to write and to read about one more evil guy so what but it is possible that in episode 9 grrm has been preparing us for a final outcome that leaves out some of the ambiguity of their relationship i am quite sure that a reciprocal love relationship between sandor and sansa has never been intended in martins story but that the author wanted to let us guess and consider the possibility something so deliciously twisted in the series the author apparently shortens and straightens their common storyline leaving out beautiful but sadly unnecessary twists and hints that will finally be meaningless for the story outcome sandor if he ever leaves the quiet isle will be sansas protector he will die for her and if she is by then old enough to recognize his emotions she might be aware that he loved her in his weird way  at the moment before she sees him dying"

myself actuallyâ<U+0080>grrm i do know theres all these people out there who are as they call themselves the sansan fans who want to see sandor and sansa get together in the endinterviewer 2 the tv show has played with that a little probably stoked those fires i would thinkgrrm well sure and ive played with it in the books theres something there but its still interesting to see how many people have responded to itinterviewer 1 im not going to say that hasnt crossed my mindhttpwwwyoutubechvclynybvoi2ianother grrm interviewone of the reasons i wanted to do this with hbo is that i wanted to keep the sex he admitted we had some real problems because dany is only 13 in the books and thats based on medieval history they didnt have this concept of adolescence or the teenage years you were a child or you were an adult and the onset of sexual maturity meant you were an adult so i reflected that in the booksbut thats a problem for a tv showso we ended up with a 22yearold portraying an 18yearold instead of an 18yearold portraying a 13yearold george said if we decided to lose the sex we could have kept the original ages and once you change the age of one character you have to change the ages of all the characters and change the date of the war that dethroned the mad kingthe fact we made all these changes indicates how important we thought sex washttpwwwokmagazinmesthroneshboand another grrm interview also recentthe other big decision we had to make to keep all that material was the ages of the characters in the books dany is 13 years old when all of this begins and i was drawingâ<U+0080> although my books are fantasy not historical fiction in the strict sense they occur in an imaginary world and imaginary kingdoms theyre very heavily based on real history and of course ive done a ton of research about real medieval history and basically in the middle ages they did not have our concept of adolescence of this sort of these sort of teenage years in between where were kind of adults but not adults and we have different ages where were allowed to vote at this age and were allowed to go to war and die at a different age and were allowed to drink at another age and have sex at a different age depending on which state were in all of that stuff they had child and adult and the difference between them was the onset of sexual maturityand we still have in our cultures remnants of this older structure in our ceremonies the jewish bar mitzvah the catholic confirmation ceremony which i went through at 13 reaffirming as an adult the vows made for me by my godparents at baptism the catholics once considered 13 adulthoodâ<U+0080> these things are just remnants now but they werent remnants in the middle ages and theyre not in the books they had a very different way of looking at things so i was using that based on historical precedentbut there was no way that was going to fly in our present environment if we had cast a 13 year old dany there could have been no sexual stuff whatsoever with her and even if we had cast a 17 year old actress playing a 13 year old there are some really stringent laws in the uk you cant do that even if you have an actress who is past the age of consent playing someone who is under the age of consent you cannot have a sexual situation so we have a 22 year old actress playing a 17 year old dany instead of a 17 year old actress playing a 13 year old dany and we did that deliberately so we could include this material so i think that speaks to the fact that we did think it was necessary to the story we wanted to tellhttpwwwyoutubechvqttw8metkoi added the transcript edited by le cygne 09 february 2013  0453 pm"

"Little Red Riding Hood",2012-12-11,"thank you yes he wrote marvelously talking about this has made me remember a plot that really has many points of contact with sandor and sansa relationship lady chatterleys lover have you read it of dhl the great friend of my beloved aldous huxleyof course the characters of sandor and sansa are more intense better written stronger for that reason i like so much asoiaftheir characters are so alive so pure flesh and blood edited by little red riding hood 11 december 2012  1238 pm"

"willowbark",2013-02-09,"i noticed that as well it was as if george was trying to say he intended more of a daughterishprotector role as the core of their relationshipnot a romantic one he is drawn to her innocence he wants to protect her but its not a sexual attractioni always thought sansa later remembering a kiss that never happened was just her childish tendency to romanticize everything trying hard to stay alive shes terrified of the hound and in no way attracted to him yet she recalls him kissing her sounds like a random firing out of one of her beloved songs about knights saving ladiessansa was one of my favorite characters to read from the very first book and i never ever thought of there being any romance between them until i came to this forum where it seems to be considered a given i think that when he wrote the books he had certain relationships in mind and was surprised at how readers may have interpreted them maybe he has asked the show creators to give a better sense of what he meant by those relationships i remember watching one interview where he talked about the fact that he considered dany and drogo to be a great love story  i didnt quite get that from the book but it seemed that the show made more efforts to make that visible i think the sansan relationship may also be one of these situations where the show is trying to clarify the need for the hound to protect sansa rather than the perceived romantic relationship i think if the show was going to go for a more romantic vibe for the couple they may have gone for a younger looking actor for sandor to reduce the liklihood of the ick factor of modern sensibilities of the age factor also my take on the doll falling to the floor was that it may be the nod that she is warging sandor which is a pretty big theory on the explanation of the kiss that never was as i understand it"
"Le Cygne",2013-02-09,"some reviews of the episodeshowalso i think that fact that the hound is clearly in love with her in a beautybeast sort of way helps endear her to us ignsansa and the hound sansa and the hound i have to admit that the scene where sansa finds sandor in her room after he leaves the battle is one of my favorites in all of the books im a 12yearold beauty and the beast fan at heart i only wish we couldve seen more of them together throughout the season chicago tribunewhy oh why wouldnt sansa go with the hound at this point their shared scenes have always been a pleasure to watch but none more so than their final one last night though he never asked his little bird for a song did he torsansa argues that stannis wont hurt her which the hound quickly explains that yes he will hes a killer like him like ned like robb and to look him in the face so she can get used to seeing men that killâ<U+0080><U+0094>theyre all around her making the world what it is she looks at him and is no longer afraid hes the beast and shes belle and gosh hes just gruff because hes scared tale as old as timeâ<U+0080> song as old as rhymeyou wont hurt me she realizesno little bird i wont hurt you but he will leave and does hey dont judge mebut while bronn distracts himself with a presumably hired lady love sandor keeps a rather affectionate candle burning for sansa perhaps making a reference to flame isnt exactly appropriate considering that sandor was scared enough of the fire to desert his post but that does bring up another subtle contrast between himself and firestarter bronn doesnt it tv overmindbut as fire raged outside kings landing the hound finally had enough handing in his tersely memorable notice and pausing only to offer sanctuary to sansa on his way sadly his little bird rejected his offer â<U+0080><U+0093> but their surprisingly tender scene provided a brief respite amid the death and destruction the guardiani never thought it would be possible but the hound made me tear up a bit his conversation with sansa was so heartfelt their relationship has been building up to this but it was still surprising will sansa get out with him in time iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m guessing that she will be too late once again cliqueclackthe hound is obviously soft for sansa  i think she represents a pureness and innocence he can never possess and of course there is her beauty such a beauty that it reminds the hound of his inner and outer ugliness and so she becomes a kind of symbol of all things clean that he feels motivated to protect and yet sansa refuses him not so dailyand sansa wellâ<U+0080>sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s clearly getting much better at manipulating joffrey and her scenes with cersei and most notably the scene with the hound rory mccann were some of the best weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve seen with the character what culturesandor clegane rory mccann surprised us in this episode his eff it all attitude drinking and his offer to take sansa sophie turner away were at the top of the list hes clearly had enough of his employer and doesnt care who knows it we must say we probably would have fled with him if we were sansa e onlineagree or disagree with martin you have to admit he makes his point very well and scenes like the hound advancing on sansa to tell her that all men she knowsâ<U+0080><U+0094>or will knowâ<U+0080><U+0094>are killers and that the world is made by killers are at once beautiful mesmerizing and horrifying av clubthe attention martin paid to sandor and sansas subtextridden relationship was nice sandor seemedâ<U+0080><U+0094>for the first time in this seriesâ<U+0080><U+0094>a real living breathing person and rory mccann was finally let out of his cage and allowed to do his thing that final scene in sansas chamber was delightfully scripted acted and shot and i loved the slow confidence in sansas eyes when she stared up at him and said you wont hurt me tv equalsbut he arrived stannis who deserves major props for walking the walk he was the first of his men on to land and on to the ladders was defeated and were left to wonder if tyrion is alive where sansa is off to with hound and how the kings guard will react to its highness as a coward tv fanaticdespite his burned and battered visage hes no monster merely a man sickened by all the hypocritical monstrous things hes seen other supposedly better men do to one another with the water on fire and his life on the line sandor clegane used his one good eye to take a cleareyed look at the real cost of other peoples games and did the most reasonable thing of all he walked away grantlandhaving abandoned the battle he offers to take sansa with him returning her to winterfell an offer she momentarily rejects but seems to relent to in the end or does she screencrushhe offers to take her back to winterfell and to protect her but she refuses still saying how much she loves joffrey thats when the hound gets real with her looks her straight in the eyes and explains that hes not playing games hes being 100 percent honest he will keep her safe and she doesnt need to keep lying and pretending to love joffrey and it seems to work buddy tvwar forces us to consider our allegiances and in that battle the hound realizes that his king is not worth protecting with the flames nipping at his heels that he feels differently about sansa says something about the character something the show has been subtly laying the groundwork for all season cultural learningsthe hound doesnt say much but the show has done a good subtle job of letting us know what sandor clegane thinks of joffreys treatment of the little bird huffington postsansa is almost raped before being rescued by the hound who takes care of things in his usual brute force fashion but his affection for sansa is obvious i didnt do it for you he tells tyrion av clubi loved finally seeing a bit of interaction between sandor clegane and sansa while he may not look the part he is quite the knight in shining armor torjust as its about to get really horrible the hound shows up disembowels one snaps another guys neck and kills the third one leaving the last guy cowering in the corner he tosses sansa over his shoulder and tells her youre all right little bird i think he likes sansa he brings her to the castle where tyrion frets over her because hes ultimately a gentleman and then thanks the hound who is all honey badger about it dont give a shit if youre proud of me didnt do it for you hey dont judge mei was glad to see that sansa didnt relent but fought back despite being outnumbered and outmatched the horror of the neargang rape scene was keenly felt in her terror and distress and the savage and uncaring masks of her attackers seeing her as something to be destroyed to be bloodied and used to be cast off like garbage its the hound of course who comes to her rescue the monster who is far more civilized than his masterâ<U+0080><U+0094>or anyone reallyâ<U+0080><U+0094>would give him credit for in fact its the fourth time the hound has saved her last season he chided joffrey when he made sansa stare at neds rotten head on a spike he saved her from a beating when he told joffrey that sansa wasnt just being superstitious when she made the comment about his name day he gave her his cloak when joffrey orders her stripped in the throne roomupon seeing the frenzy of the crowd the first thought that tyrion peter dinklage has is of sansas safety but hes thinking in far more pragmatic terms seeing the stark girl as a bargaining chip a hostage a pawn its not the hounds perception he sees sansa as a little bird whom he saves from the hungers of the crowd bringing her back to the keep so she can be returned to her cage his sense of honor and morality is at odds with both his freakish appearance and his own use of brutality rather than just save sansa he disembowels one of her captors and slays them all gruesomely he has the bottle to be just as brutal as anyone else but he has a moral code that sets him apart from the wildness of those around him televisionaryenter the hound who saves the little bird from her attackers and carries her to safety tyrion thanks him with a well done clegane but sandor just says i didnt do it for you sansdor shipping i am in you chicago tribuneyoull be glad of the hateful things i do someday when youre queen and im all that stands between you and your

"scurvy",2012-05-29,"i just saw the screentime list and the hound has the most this episode he was great fuck the kingi just wish he had said bugger the kings guard bugger the city bugger the kingand had he told sansa about how his brother burned him two episodes ago and told her if she told anyone he would kill her it would be so much more the lf scene at the tourney didnt hold true how would lf know and why would he say it aloud publicly if he did sandor would gut himloved the portrayal loved the actual use of the character he and arya are going to rock next season"

"Kittykatknits",2012-05-31,"it was nice finally seeing rory bring the hound to life he was amazing in this episode the lines were great and all very in character which makes sense as martin actually wrote this episode loved seeing him walk in to the brothel and all conversation stops he then kicks two guys out of their table and takes their drink too which i thought was a nice touch i think his line fuck the kingsguard fuck the city fuck the king might be the most epic line of the show that wasnt taken from the books can not wait to see more of him"

"victim",2012-06-02,"it actually makes me really uncomfortable that there is an executive producer who represents the pervert side of the audience while i dont have a problem with nudity when it is used appropriately in scenes which require it i have a problem when it is used gratuitously and in scenes where it doesnt add much take for example the littlefinger scene in season one where he tells the story of brandon and catelyn it was completely gratuitous that such a scene would take place when really his monologue should have been more than enough to capture the audience that there is a ta producer breathing down directors necks to include such scenes is unforgivable the scene in question i dont think was particularly bad as theres plenty of reason to believe that bronn would like a prostitute on the night before a large battle although it was gratuitous in the way it was shown what i mean is that for a producer to approach marshall about the shots he is choosing and urge him to film fullfrontal nudity is quite disturbing i believe that just because someone is naked in a scene doesnt mean they have to show everything i couldnt help but feel sorry for the poor actress who had to sit there naked while such a good scene took place"

"Wouter",2012-06-02,"so confirmation there is such a thing as boob quota on hbo a shame got doesnt need a bit of porn added to be successfulanother thing that did strike me during the interview is that it was marshalls decision to send stannis fighting up the battlements  the script had him just standing there beneath the walls as he said on the one hand maybe grrm could have done more letting him lead the reinforcements who attacked tyrions sortie for example but it does also confirm that tvfilm making rules apparently demand that such characters are action menwhile stannis scenes were great in a way and also showed a particularly strong contrast with joffrey its still a bit of a shame in my opinion that it just has to be like that on tv as great as tv is books are still clearly superior in many ways in my opinion also because they dont have to deal with design by committee and by focus groups edited by wouter 02 june 2012  0438 am"
"Woman of War",2012-06-02,"why do people have so many issues with nudity and sex scenes and not with bodies cut in half but seriously there is nothing wrong with nudity and sex if it is definitely part of the story and not only added for thrills this gets though difficult with no nudity clauses in some contracts and some actors being minors but showing cersei naked on her walk of shame for example would not be gratitious but necessary especially if her body is not fashionably perfect  how could it after three children showing jaime and cersei having sex over joffreys corpse is not for thrills but an important part of the story daenerys naked and vulnerable was necessary so prudity would simply be wrong here baring a characters body means baring his soul as well making him or her helpless or threatening and a movie can make use of it prude decency might be wrong here"

"King Tommen",2012-05-28,"its also very naive to think that a tv episode screenwriter is solely responsible for the finished product on the screen showrunners have their fingers in almost every aspect of the production of every episode including the writing scenes are often added and altered after the script has been submitted so if you like the episode it seems really silly to praise martin solely for it and not acknowledge that the entire production team especially dd had a hand in putting it together and it bears mentioning again that a big reason why some of the characters were so fleshed out in this episode was because martin was allowed to stay in one location for the entire 60 minutes and not have to hop around every 3 minutes to check in on the other 78 storylines that he covered off in his novels a luxury not afforded the writers of the other episodes this season he also got a massive budget afforded to him for this episode alone that dd went to hbo begging hat in hand for so that many of the battle storylines could be executed effectively he gets the characters better than anyone else of course that goes without saying but somehow implying that everyone else working on this show is incompetent is ridiculous i liked the pointy end martinss season 1 episode a lot but it wasnt the best entry that year and imo didnt stand head and shoulders above the other great writing work done that year by everyone else i hope we continue to get martin to check in every season as he does bring a lot to the table but lets be honest in saying that blackwater was an easy softball down the middle of the plate for him to knock out of the park"

"David Selig",2012-05-28,"i dont see it honestly yeah it was a really good episode but in terms of writing baelor for example was just as good if not better and it really helped martin that he had the green light to write a whole episode only about a single plotline which is the climactic point of the bookseason which wasnt an option for the other episodes"

"Lord Godric",2012-05-28,"so its your contention that the producers of the show had no intention of showing a battle at all until martin gave them a script that had fight scenes in it and they suddenly realized that they should show it brilliantthe interview you are referring to is what dd had resigned themselves to something they may have had to show given the limitations of the budget before deciding to go to hbo for the increased funds for the episode so that they could stage a battle on some kind of larger scale this was long before martin submitted a script as all of the writers would need to have a general outline for each episode provided by the producers before knowing how to structure their given hourare people here so obtuse as to not understand what showrunners do they are involved at every stage of the production they arent the hbo suits these guys know the books backwards and forwards and have sat down and spoken to grrm for countless hours about the direction and plotting of the series and how to best adapt his novels they arent some idiots sitting in a room waiting for martin to tell them how to stage a tv showno shit but i remember many times seeing martin writing about his script and wondering if they were going to be able to do it at all i certainly think that it is possible that if david and dan knew that they were going to write they episode they could have made the decision to not go to hbo and request more money because they would try to make it work their way knowing martin was writing the episode and knowing he writes things much larger for television probably pushed them to decide to show the battle instead of getting reports about it in their interview they admit that this episode was given to martin because he does things big if he wasnt doing it we probably would have had most of the action coming in the form of reports"
"Rapsie",2012-05-28,"brilliant episode and the writing was fantastic the characters felt like they were from the books which they havent done in recent episodes"
"King Tommen",2012-05-28,"well your implication was that actually filming the battle of blackwater wasnt even on dds radar until martin brought it to their attention which seems ridiculous if you watch that interview and others with dd you can see that they very much want to show these battles were angry about having to cut tyrions battle last year but had to remain within budget there was a clear decision early on in the conception of season 2 that they absolutely needed to make an exception for blackwater because of how the entire season builds towards it so they went to hbo with their business case as to why they needed the extra funds to film it how anyone takes that interview and makes the leap in logic that martin told them that they should film the battle of blackwater is beyond me anyone with half a brain who has read the books knows that filming this battle would be very important which is why they took the extraordinary steps of asking for substantially more money for this one time exception im not sure where the impression that martin writes much larger for television comes from was the pointy end written any larger than any other season 1 episode the reason this episode was big was because it was blackwater not because martin wrote it dd love martin and wanted to entrust him with a very important episode which happened to be blackwater not because he writes teleplays with lots of action scenes pretty sure thats not something hes known for at all"
"Howdyphillip",2012-05-28,"no shit but i remember many times seeing martin writing about his script and wondering if they were going to be able to do it at all i certainly think that it is possible that if david and dan knew that they were going to write they episode they could have made the decision to not go to hbo and request more money because they would try to make it work their way knowing martin was writing the episode and knowing he writes things much larger for television probably pushed them to decide to show the battle instead of getting reports about it in their interview they admit that this episode was given to martin because he does things big if he wasnt doing it we probably would have had most of the action coming in the form of reportsi work in the industry lighting tv and film so i have a little bit of insight here i dont know anyone from this production so i have no real inside scoops i am just speaking from conjecture i dont think that hbo gave two shits who was penning this actual episode when it came down to decisions of increasing budgets grrm is signed on for an ep a year so they certainly want his name at some point on the season but they didnt pour money in an episode because of the person who wrote it they increased the budget because it was necessary for the series as a whole dd would have written a different script but they would have still lobbied to get the additional financing and they would have written in large scale scenes as wellthe only reason that dd talked about having to write the whole thing from the perspective of cercei was that they were afraid that the budget wouldnt come through and that would be the cuts that they were left able to afford that is why they say they begged for more money to tell you the complete truth i dont believe that they had to beg too hard hbo knew what they had on their hands and knew that the extra money they spent would be well worth it for all of the word of mouth and critical acclaim that they would get for the extra dough they spent this is the kind of money that is spent that actually works for you and turns into more"

"protar",2012-05-30,"far and away the best episode of the season nay the series im sorry but martin just blows the other writers away that is how you adapt asoiaf youll notice that there were actually a lot of book deviations but virtually all of them had a justification and stayed true to the spirit of the novels the only scene that fell a bit flat for me was bronn vs hound wish we could have martin writing all the episodes or more realistically though probably still very unlikely i wish they drew up a new deal so martin gets more control over the show like veto power over some of the changes season 2 couldve ran a lot smoother with such a deal"
"SerMixalot",2012-05-30,"for me the negative changes have had nothing to do with budget or the number of episodes for me it has been changes to basic characterization things like jon needing a father figure or robb hooking up with talisa cause his mother showed him noone else is completely honorable etc these changes dramatically change the book characters and i can see no reason for those changes we need to see how they will resolve the robbtalisa relationship but i just cant see how they can do it realistically they could have changed a little of the dialogue kept the same story arcs and made the characters closer to the book ie jon snow this seems to arise from a basic misconception of jons character they developed this aryatywin arc that albeit was well acted went nowhere and left out important character development ok i agree that it would have taken more sets more characters to develop arya properly here but still something could have been done the dany arc has been rather a bore for me her arc has been relatively pointless and could easily have been done closer to the book with the same amount of timebudget ok it wouldnt have had the cool dragon theft story but that story is leaving me with a full case of meh does anyone really think she wont get her dragons back and so many of her scenes have just seemed repeptitive i think the kl arcs were for the most part decent though they probably could have deleted the joffrey tortures prostitute scene and added a scene or two on either establishing a clearer link between tyrion and ros or shown some of the darker sides of tyrion killing simon silvertongue for example though again for the most part kl worked though they could have lessened some of the changes to cersei"

"Sheep the Evicted",2012-05-28,"i said last week that headey is a truly fantastic actress she is a terrible cerscei i suspect its more her fault then the writers and like everyone else i hated her portrayal at first but once i got over the changes i just have to admit she is incredibly entertaining to watch i actually think i liked her scenes more then i liked the battle"

"Ramsay Gimp",2012-05-27,"stannis should have had a cool baratheon or rhllor themed helmet other than that great ep"
"Morvran",2012-05-27,"my only nitpick would have been if shae was able to break into her story that cersei requested but thankfully she was cut off when she started when i was 13 i groaned and just about punched the couch hehe but it didnt happen so nitpick retracted"
"SerMixalot",2012-05-27,"the only nitpick is that i makes the rest of the season seem like even less"
"SerMixalot",2012-05-27,"not having lancel the hound and stannis wear helmets but that makes sense so we know who they are stannis definitely would have been 1st up the ladder he is that macho cersei and sansaoutstanding shaecant wait for her to die varys awesome as always"
"Patchface12",2012-05-27,"easily the best episode in the season so far maybe martin like us did not like d  ds treatment of the hound and cersei he made cersei a bitch with little to no redeeming qualities and when the hound called sansa little bird i finally felt like he was the book character on screen not some glorified background character the most minor nitpick i can think of is shae is too likeable other than that awesome amazing episode"
"UnknownSoldier",2012-05-27,"my only nitpick would be the scene on the blackwater the way it played out with the literal creeping doom as the wildfyre spread to the ships and then as everything got crushed up against the chain was one of my favorite scenes in the series while the explosion was cool it just didnt do the scene justice"
"Ciglon",2012-05-27,"who says he survived although i will be most displeased just for the manderly negotiationsim fairly certain he will survive or else who will set edric storm free and be forgiven for it who will be able to convince stannis to head north who will go to get rickon from skagosi dont believe anyone is capable of doing all that except davos remember that he is the only voice that speaks truthfully and without abandon to stannis except melisandre since everyone else just repeats her words to him like a parrot seeing as its pretty certain that he will be coming back i think it would have been better to have him fall when the boat sankgot ripped asunderi mean matthos was blown away by the explosion and it will later be revealed that he died from that but from what we saw it looked like davos suffered a blow equal or even worse than his son did and we expect him to survive not entirely farfetched admittedly but a tad bit hard to believe"
"Dunnii",2012-05-27,"i havent really posted  been lurking each week  but just had to say this was a great episode loved the wildfire but i want to nitpick about lena headly way too much cersei tonight the way she talks drives me nuts and i hate her character so much i hate her more than joffrey so it was nerve wracking to have to watch her talk so much but overall what a great episode and im glad tyrion didnt lose his nose its tv  i dont want to look at a man without a nose voldemort was enough"
"SerMixalot",2012-05-27,"my biggest complaint is that i wont have anything to complain about this week"
"K.C.",2012-05-27,"does the existence of ros in the preview for next weeks episode count i know how much the nitpickers love her"
"moonsblood",2012-05-27,"overall it was a great ep i really wish georgie could write every one little things lena really over did the drunk acting i found her to be more comical than anything else the sandor and sansa scene was a bit weak i was sad to see the chain go but i get it"
"Affcwasmyfavorite",2012-05-27,"my only nitpick was too much nonessential fluff at the beginning i spent half the episode looking at the clock on my tv going shit shit shit 10mins left how will they oh they just shoved it in at the last second ok xd"
"Magjee",2012-05-27,"solid episode i hope nonreaders gathered what happened there would have loved to see the all out battle as described in the book but it would have been impossible with a tv budget sadpng classbbcemoticon alt "

"Valkyrja",2012-05-27,"i agree with some of the nitpicks above especially about the scale of the battle i appreciate the budget constraints but it would have been nice to have just a few more wideshots of everything but most of all my nitpick as to be expected is houndrelated no bloodstained white cloak left in sansas room bawlgif classbbcemoticon altbawl  unless of course she somehow still has the one he gave her earlier in the season but considering he wore it again afterward or another one i highly doubt it cryinggif classbbcemoticon altcrying  edited by valkyrja 27 may 2012  1145 pm"

"House Martell",2012-05-28,"i mean matthos was blown away by the explosion and it will later be revealed that he died from that but from what we saw it looked like davos suffered a blow equal or even worse than his son did and we expect him to survive not entirely farfetched admittedly but a tad bit hard to believematthos was on the back of the boat nearest to the explosion after the bomb ship passed them and was consumed by flame davos was on the far end of the ship and the explosion threw him off away from the fire into the water which will be what saves himyes the no helms was a little silly but its tv you dont want all your actors running around in helmets with their faces coveredis stannis was too awesome a nitpickand my biggest complaint is grrm just made all the other writers look foolish"

"K.C.",2012-05-28,"hk47 i was wondering the same thing about cerseis homeless shelter i think it was supposed to be a bunker but cersei questioning shae made total sense to me especially if she was drunk also the choice of singer during the credits made it seem like someone got game of thrones and true blood mixed up"
"tolthar",2012-05-28,"just wanted to point out that tyrions wound is exactly what that type of gash would look like after just being cut its not till it bleeds and pusses and gets infected and rots that it becomes worse as it bleeds more it will inflame and get bigger this is a fresh sword cut to the face and in the books he only loses the bridge of his nose its what tyrions believes is comical about it when he looks at it in a mirrorlets at least see what it looks like next episode"
"The Smiling Eye",2012-05-28,"if i had to nitpick itd be about sandor i get that hes impressively strong and one of the strongest men in westeros but him cleaving a man in full plate in two effortlessly is a bit too much i think that requires superhuman strength especially with a mere sword"

"Jolene Brown",2012-05-28,"that was absolutely badass the only teeny tiny quibble is that i think they could have worked in the renlys ghost thing with a line or two of dialogue and a weird fuzzy vision stannis had of renlygethin anthonys face or maybe by giving someone else the relevant lines of dontoss dialogue to sansa but the ending was so amazing and the episode was so great  i hope episode 10 can live up to it its funny but i always thought it was loras in renlys armor in the books anyway  i was really shocked when it turned out that it was garlan instead i must have missed whatever reference made it clear it wasnt loras when i was reading the book initially"
"Brucolac",2012-05-28,"loras tells jaime about the battle and not being able to fit into renlys armor garlan is probably not going to be cast anyway so it makes sense to use loras instead i think that was only in there for book fans anyone who hasnt read them isnt really going to notice that rider being all that different from the others"

"Qwop22",2012-05-28,"one thing that sort of killed the battle for me was the fact that stannis was the first one to charge off the little skiff right into the wall of archers with no helmet on first off why would the king be on the front lines missing armor charging straight into a wall of fire arrows secondly he just climbed his way right up that ladder into defenders without getting hurt that whole scene of that small group of men standing at the wall with stannis and then climbing up the wall seemed a little cheesy to me i would think they would all have gotten slaughtered either in the charge to the gate or definitely climbing the ladder lol but its a tv show and i know it has constraints the episode was still awesome"

"StannisandDaeny",2012-05-31,"since this thread is for nitpicking without repercussion let me echo what many have said here and on other threads about the lack of helmets on these key playersincluding stannis who doesnt belong anywhere near this battle but theyve got to show him as a fearless commander i supposei cant repeat it enough but stannis did fight on the blackwater in the books just off screen he said lightbringer didnt serve me better than any other sword on the blackwater how would he know if he hadnt used it he just didnt fight on the walls in the book but thats because of the geography of the battle changing and minor characters like guyard moriggen being cut plus grrm wrote it he decides what his characters can or cant domake stannis fiery heart on his breast plate more prominentobvious for example or give him an antlered helmentthats actually more dangerous than what he did now its like saying here i am see im the king here i am shoot me am i plain enough for all to see should i wear an even brigther outfit stannis instead blended in with his men which was the smarter choice some enemy soldiers would know his face but a lot of men wouldnt be able to make him out as the king because theyve never seen him up close he wore no helmet so at least his men would recognize him and there were plently of soldiers without helmets as well like the one he kills a helmet may give some protection but it also severely limits your hearing vision and if its a visored helmet like you suggest your ability to shout orders which are all extremely important for a commander in the book stannis wears only a crown in battle edited by stannisanddaeny 31 may 2012  0542 am"

"Silverx2",2012-05-31,"this isnt so much a nitpick of the show as the story overall but once again we get a scene that shows why i hate the character sansa so much it seems like she goes out of her way to avoid being saved in the books we at least get her pov we know she had a plan to escape but in the show here comes the hound stopped by her room specifically to ask her if she wanted him to take her with him north and she said no okay sure she thinks stannis is winning but that doesnt change the fact that he drawbridge is up and the castle is full of lannister guards a wooden door isnt going to stop them from getting in her character is just so infuriating which is also why i like arya so much sansa waits to be rescued and constantly refuses opportunities to help herself escape arya sees opportunities and takes them my other nitpick would be about the fleet no not that they got that close to one ship but that other nitpickers seem to think that sailing a boat is like driving a car most of the fleet are mainly sail powered once in formation breaking apart and scattering becomes extremely hard and potentially dangerous naval combat is much more different that arial and ground"

"Elba the Intoner",2012-05-31,"i havent posted on the nitpick thread before mostly because i wanted to see how everything played out first but now that we are at episode 9 i want to nitpick about something that keeps popping up not just in this episode but others that i dont like that is why do they keep referencing how much varys likes little boys this is the third time at least that there has been some hint to it and i dont like it its not necessary to his character and i thought that in the books he was only using little boys and girls as part of his spy network i guess what bothers me about it is that its another change to a character that i dont understand and i think it hurts his character in the books it is littlefinger who uses children as sex slaves giving little boys to lynn corbray and that is one of the reasons why i hate him though varys is no saint and he does use children for his little birds network i didnt get the feeling it was for sexual uses which to me is worse anyway thats just my feelings on the matter i guess its not really a big deal in how the show is playing out but i dont like it"

"Feron Amathy",2012-06-05,"the ending annoyed me they really messed up the whole renlys ghost thing by being in two minds about how far to push it and ending up doing it halfarsed meaning it confuses those who havent read the books and annoys those who have they take care to focus on a guy being a bamf riding a white horse but without any dialogue to convey that the horsemans wearing renlys armour its wasted my proposed alternative because obviously i know better than george and d  d episode where cat and the viewer are reintroduced to renly as well as the return of loras and renly and the introduction of margaery you have one more storm lord in the shot doesnt matter who said storm lord exchanges 10 seconds worth of dialogue with renly equivalent to how they introduced karstark with robb post shadowbaby littlefinger and the two tyrells and said storm lord are in the tent with renlys body the scene works as they did it except that the storm lord makes no move to leave at the end of the scene loras notices and asks him if hes coming storm lord apologises and says that with renly dead stannis is the undisputed ruler of the stormlands and his place is by his side later in the episode 30 second shot of stannis landing on the beach the storm lord has the remnants of renlys army lined up waiting for him they all kneel and stannis and the storm lords eyes meet storm lord dips his head and stannis nods slight smile of satisfaction on his face blackwater storm lord is with stannis when the wildfire goes down could even make it him who argues with stannis that hundreds will die storm lord leads the reinforcements who attack tyrions victorious sortee while stannis is fighting on the wall tywin and some bamf on a white horse charge in cut straight from badm to storm lords stricken face he whispers renly under his breath cut to tyrion about to pass out watching the cavalry pour in but add shouts of renly to the sound effects then cut to stannis seeing his men running and shouting at them to hold then have him do a whole renly under his breadth then cut back to a close shot of badms helmet with the antlers then back to stannis clearly unable to believe his eyes being dragged to safety by his men while hes too stunned to resist then as cerseis finishing her story to tommen cut to one low shot of the horsemen dismounting so you see the white horses legs and a slowmow of the riders boots hitting the ground with twyins boots encrusted with lions so you know its him hitting the ground next to him as he too dismounts then when they enter the throne room you see loras taking off the antlered helmet benefits 1 gives added weight to renly earlier in the season the only recognisable characters in his camp are loras margaery brienne and renly himself all very young and inexperienced lending weight to istartedthiswarbykidnappinganinnocentdwarfwithnoideawhatiwasgoingtodonext cats holier than thou playing at war crap 2 showing an actual transfer of stormlands power from renly to stannis without any dialogue and with a scene lasting seconds instead of littlefingers expositionheavy explanation to the tyrells 3 viewers understand the whole renlys ghost thing makes it clear why stannis men rout and its a coolclever idea lets the tyrells make one last homage to renly before they complete the alliance with the lannisters 4 foreshadows and therefore makes more believable stannis regret over murdering renly in episode 10 5 doesnt leave viewers wondering wtf the white horse was all about george i await youre invitation to help you with winds so that it gets released at some point in the next decade edit and have littlefinger enter the throne room with tywin and loras with close up of him with a sly grin on his face before the fade to black this would reinforce that it was lf who brought lannister and tyrell together effectively shaping how the season would turn out and repair some of the damage done to lfs subtle puppetmaster image after the hammering the writers have given it this season pointlessly threatening cersei pointlessly threatening ros hey cat ive just brought you the bones of your husband who i betrayed by the way do you wanna hook up edited by feron amathy 05 june 2012  0500 pm"

"Gogossos",2012-05-28,"the first time i came across sansa after ned beheading both in the books and in the show i was curious to see how she gets her resolve in the books we have the internal dialogue to clue us in and in the show the story relies on sophies acting and how great is she after neds death she had this glaze over her eyes where there was brightness before this year the writers have made her confide in shae in order to portray her true feelings but she doesnt need that if she continues in the same vein as that retort to tyrion"

"Caro99",2012-05-28,"ive always liked sophies acting i hated that lf told her about the hounds scars but sophies face as she hears that story was really well done and of course after baelor shes appears to really get the character i think both her body language and her face expression can convey many of sansas internal dialogues from the books so i can see a great actress on the making last nights episode only proved to be yet another hard acting challenge she managed to overcome brilliantly and even if the sansan scene wasnt what i wanted i think both sophie and rory did a great job with what they were allowed to do edit and i was happy to see sansa telling tyrion she was praying for him to end up probably just like joff in her mind so happy we wont have her suddenly falling into his arms when they marry but now more people may get her less cause tyrion is in the show basically the good guy so shell come off as an ungratful girl or something instead of a victim of a forced marriage to a man whose family destroyed hers and in the books tyrion never really understood nor even took the time to come to know her yet in the show we have him now thrices sort of admiring her i can already imagine sophies great acting during her wedding to tyrion crying and refusing to kneel down edited by caro99 28 may 2012  0604 pm"
"Woman of War",2012-05-28,"sophie turner has actually grown in this episode finally she appeared as the teenage girl she is supposed to be in the series not as the frightened little girl acting far too young for her age as she has done so far i liked her in the farewell scene with joffrey and tyrion she actually seemed rather sharp and she was not a meek passive little bird with sandor but she had some standing when she refused to go with him that was easier actually because the rapey aspect of that encounter was not there sandor acted more like a very twisted father figure who was honest with offering support not lashing out with that creepy mixture of violence and craving for closeness and sexual dominance and that more adult sansa could afford holding the doll and remembering her father without being childish like sansa of season one would have appeared sandor referring to ned fitted in here as well"

"Lyanna Stark",2012-05-29,"i get that we are suppose to think sansa was counting on stannis to win and she didnt think stannis would hurt her that doesnt make sense though stannis wont hurt her but he definitely wouldnt take her home either stannis considered robb an enemy so he isnt going to just send sansa to her mom so even though stannis would have kept her safe she also knows sandor would to and since sandor specifically offered to take her to winterfell it makes no sense that she wouldnt go with him especially when you consider stannis hadnt completely taken the city at that point so anything could have happened for all sansa knows right after sandor left ser ilyn could have showed up or cersei you know there was no certainty that sansa would ever see stannis at the point when sandor made his offer also most young people usually take the fast payout instead of the longer road even if the longer roud is the better choice because young people dont think ahead like that so again i say it doesnt make much sense agreegif classbbcemoticon altagree thats my one gripe with an otherwise 100 stellar episode in the books its far more obvious why she doesnt go with him but showsandor is not nearly as socially inept as booksandor"

"Lady Sansa Stark",2012-05-29,"im not so sure stannis did make quite a point of offering cat joff and cerseis heads for what they did to ned i could easily see him shipping sansa back to winterfell robb would be his one ally against the remaining lannistertyrell alliance nostannis even straight up told cat that he would send her girls back to her if either of them were in kings landing when he took the cityindeed he did but he did name robb to die when melisandre asked to name someone i never forgive him that although i want him to take the iron throneits just too bad that they didnt give sansa a valid reason to refuse to go with the hound i mean in the books it was obvious why although i probably would go with him regardless in the show however i would totally go with him there was absolutely no reason why she wouldnt as sansa says he wont hurt her"
"YTDN",2012-05-29,"i think sansas reasoning is that if she goes with sandor shell end up on the run through the wartorn countryside her only protection being a man who while he said he wouldnt hurt her still admits to finding killing fun staying and waiting for stannis means she would be even as a prisoner in relative safety and security and probably has more chance of being reunited with her family as part of some treaty than running of into the unknown with sandor"
"Jamie Lannister",2012-05-29,"indeed he did but he did name robb to die when melisandre asked to name someone i never forgive him that although i want him to take the iron throneits just too bad that they didnt give sansa a valid reason to refuse to go with the hound i mean in the books it was obvious why although i probably would go with him regardless in the show however i would totally go with him there was absolutely no reason why she wouldnt as sansa says he wont hurt heryeah thats true he didnt even beat around the bush he says hed take her home to winterfell shes not even met ser dontos the fool yet so its not like she has anything else going for her other than the possible belief that stannis would treat her well shes also just spent an evening learning about highborn girls being raped during a citys fall"

"Harrad",2012-05-30,"that is fundamentally unjust even in a society as backwards as the sunset kingdomsthe point is that tyrion did not seek this marriage and only consented to it after much misgivings because he was forced to by his family and he also knew sansas other options were even worse he did not even demand his husbandly rights another facet of that and other modern societies his marrying sansa was the best plausible thing that could happen to her under the circumstances later when the circumstances changed she was able to escape"

"scurvy",2012-06-02,"also when tywin manipulates not forces tyrion in to marrying sansa he broadly hints that something is going to happen with robb soon with his comments about how some wars are won with words and letters rather than swords its pretty clear he is planning something to make sansa the heirthanks for the timeline clarification but sansa is robbs heir already with bran and rickon presumed dead he plans to make sansa lady of winterfell"

"Lyanna Stark",2012-06-04,"thanks for the timeline clarification but sansa is robbs heir already with bran and rickon presumed dead he plans to make sansa lady of winterfellno thats never going to happen sansa as lady lannister would remain a hostage to the lannisters in the south she would never be permitted to go back north as if she showed up with tyrion it would mean some northman would kill him and sansa would be free to marry one of them instead and produce little starks that waythe only surefire way the lannisters can make sure to put one of theirs in winterfell is to have sansa as a broodmare in the south and send hers and tyrions son north eventually there have even been speculations that tywin meant to have sansa have an accident eventually to make it easier to have her sons placed as stark heirs in winterfell due to her not being around any more to cause possible inheritance problemsof course if robbs will ever comes to light we may see that sansa has been disinherited but thats another story completely"
"Caro99",2012-06-04,"no thats never going to happen sansa as lady lannister would remain a hostage to the lannisters in the south she would never be permitted to go back north as if she showed up with tyrion it would mean some northman would kill him and sansa would be free to marry one of them instead and produce little starks that waythe only surefire way the lannisters can make sure to put one of theirs in winterfell is to have sansa as a broodmare in the south and send hers and tyrions son north eventually there have even been speculations that tywin meant to have sansa have an accident eventually to make it easier to have her sons placed as stark heirs in winterfell due to her not being around any more to cause possible inheritance problemsof course if robbs will ever comes to light we may see that sansa has been disinherited but thats another story completelyoh gods youre probably right about tywin intending for sansa to have an accicent after they were done with her ive never really given a lot of thought to what wouldve happened to her had joff not died and tyrion hadnt killed tywin and was still close to sansa i guess cause i just dont like their marriage one bit but hopefully tyrion would have tried too stop itabout robbs will if it is ever revealed i want to see sansas reaction to it will she understand why robb did it i think so but will she also feel a little betrayed edited by caro99 04 june 2012  1159 am"
"scurvy",2012-05-31,"in the book sansa is of extreme value to the lannisters bc shes heir to winterfell because both bran and rickon are presumed dead with tywins conspiracy with the freys and boltons winterfell becomes sansas property thus her marriage to tyrion becomes extremely valuable to the lannisters not only has the lack of news of bran and rickons presumed death not reached cat and robb thus changing their motivations for respectively releasing the kingslayer and falling into the arms of someone other than his betrothed it now changes the value of sansa as a prisoner i can only expect that the off page bastard of boltons taking of winterfell and its sacking falsely blamed on theon turncloak leads to the ramsay reporting to his father of bran and rickons deaths roose can then notify the starks and in hatching his plan with tywin the hand of the king as well without the presumed deaths of the boys sansas marriage to tyrion is just a mummers farce and gains nothing"

"The Maid of Mansfield",2012-05-28,"arya and sandors interaction is much needed for aryas character development in the simplistic world of television sandors beliefs have pretty much been summed up by all men are killers as he has incessantly repeated during this entire season and arya is having a crash course on this sad reality much like in the books sandor will be paramount for the sedimentation of her education he is another step she must go through to form her warrior persona she is warring through life that little one i hate the concept that some people have of arya as a coldblooded killer i think of her as a survivor as someone who had to become who she is at this point in the books to make it she has been peeled off like an onion things have been taken away from her bit by bit but she will not go without a good fight sorry to go a bit offtopic"

"The Owl",2012-05-28,"my first impression upon first viewing of the episode was that stannis was being dragged off by lannister men in the last few shots of the episode it was quick and moved fast so i could not analyze it further this is of course a significant departure from the books as stannis was not captured and was able to retreat it was pointed out to me elsewhere on another forum that it was most likely his own men that were dragging him off on top of the battlements i was under the impression that he was alone up there but noticed a shot a couple of minutes earlier when one men did make their way up there to help him fight so that conclusion seems more likely but i honestly cannot tell from the second an a half where stannis is being dragged off ive rewatched it a couple of times if its by his own men or lannister men i know the former is more likely but admit that it could be a departure as well are any of you curious about this as well"

"Bronn Stone",2012-05-28,"it is my impression from the show that there is a dynamic not observed in the books varys is believed to dally with young boys it may be that society has gotten hints of his little birds but misunderstood his reasons for having them around we do know from the novels that he goes through them with alacrity it isnt too great a leap to imagine that there are whispers about the boys and misunderstanding of his purpose"

"Roxane De",2012-05-31,"i also felt the varystyrion conversations as an attempt of varys to test tyrion in case he could turn his cloak and serve danys cause that said i still have something bugging me  if varys is against magic why is he a targaryen supporter since the dragons are closely related to magic"

"Bambi",2012-05-28,"i rewatched this part a few minutes ago since someone mentioned the armor as it were renlys it can be but lorass cloak hides the most of it but yeah not so important most of the soldiers seem to be lannisters and city guards as i see"

"Ser Hippie",2012-05-28,"in the books garlan wears the armor because hes closer to renlys size than loras who wouldnt be able to pull it off in the show thats not the case so they can have loras wear it which i think is more dramatically satisfying anyway"
"Lord Godric",2012-05-28,"ive only watched the episode once so i dont remember everything when do we see loras fighting like that i imagine it is in the confusion surrounding tyrion getting wounded but i dont remember it"

"Ran",2012-05-28,"i expect george put it in there as a gesture to it in fact and with the added spin that it was sort of lorass way to honor renly and it may be that in the next episode well hear that some of stanniss men threw down their swords rather than fight against renly i suppose but really it doesnt much matter small detail"
"mcb",2012-05-28,"i think issue here is if it makes any sense within the show that loras wears renlys armour at all to scare the shit out of stannis soldiers for a few moments and if very lucky for the duration of the battle really no reason to try very hard to keep it secret afterwards as theres no need to maintain a legend of renlys ghost since the tyrells and the lannisters now sing the same song all hail king joffrey it would be politically awkward to support a legend of renly who did try to snatch the throne from under joffs assalso it was personal for loras"

"victim",2012-05-29,"loras basically convinced renly to claim himself a king in the first place i think it goes a little deeper than the tyrells using renly in this case though thats basically what it is much like the lannisters did in roberts rebellion the tyrells pick whichever side is going to win"

"TeamDanyArya",2012-05-29,"i never thought of loras wearing renlys armor as a way to scare the crap out of stannis or at the very least his men i dont remember that from the book although i can see that making complete sense stannis has taken up with the black arts so seeing his brothers armor could spook him i know the helm had to be renlys or at least representating the rainbow guard thereby honoring renly next season will be very interesting"
"Ser Hippie",2012-05-29,"it scares a lot of stannis men in the books because theyre uneducated and superstitious peasants who are spooked by seeing the dead renly coming at them i was reminded of this topic when i saw an exchange on another site where someone complained about this part of the episode because loras was wearing the armor and he was under the impression renlys ghost was actually in the armor in the books bawlgif classbbcemoticon altbawl "

"Istari",2012-05-30,"loras was in renlys armour its a shame that they didnt emphasize this a little bit more i remember prior to s2 being aired my friends and i were guessing what sort of tricks hbo would play on the nonreaders by tricks i mean plot twists that would work as cliff hangers we all agreed that renlys ghost would be one of the cliff hangersfor lack of a better word but we soon realized  once the season started and his distinctive armour wasnt emphasized  renlys ghost wouldnt make the cut granted if you watch closely the helm has antlersbut still how the hell would a non reader make that distinction my guess is that it was to appease the book readers its a shame that it wasnt included i think hbo missed an opportunity here to stir up some drama for the non readers to be fair though it was a pretty dramatic episode as is perhaps in valar morghulis there will be some sort of dialogue to explain the situation though it wont have the same effect as it would have in real time edited by istari 30 may 2012  0852 pm"

"sharkhawk",2012-05-30,"i dont think that the show deviates as much from the books on why renly declared himself king as a lot of people think although it isnt explained in the books we know that the queen of thorns wanted power for the tyrell family and what better way to get it than to have margery marry her brothers boyfriend renly didnt strike me as being the brightest bulb not very interested in the throne but more like robert the lannisters were the power behind robert why not the tyrells being the power behind renly"
"TeamDanyArya",2012-05-30,"interesting point and makes sense for the renlymargarey match i really didnt give the tyrells much credit in my initial reading of the books i guess because they arent as out there as the lannisters are their power moves are much more subtle"
"Maia",2012-06-01,"didnt like how the show pussified lancel during the battle of the blackwater frankly the funny thing about lancel is that he is a true lannister in a sense that he is physically brave and while not a great fighter like jaime or good general like tywin already were at his age he actually performed very well as a knight and an officer during this battle leading several successful sorties continuing to fight while wounded iirc and coming to the red keep to protest joffs removal from the walls"

"Ser Hippie",2012-05-30,"they didnt need to show him this week the dropped plotline is the fault of previous episodes ive said this in other threads but they needed ascene where davos tells saan that he will be in the back and saan can pissed about the lack of plunder queen etcwhy did they need that scene salladhor isnt a dropped plotline hes a memorable character but hes also a minor one whose main importance is to play off of davos after the battle people want to see salladhor because he seems funfunny in the show but seeing as this topic is about the battle as portrayed this episode i dont know why they though it was necessary here they probably could have fit it into the slog that was last episode but its not a big loss either wayotherwise the previous scenes with saan were pretty much worthlessoverdramatic much even beyond the fact that not every scene has to have some major payoff later in the show its easily something that can be touched on after the battleit doesnt matter that stannis has his ships because it hasnt been established how many ships stannis has and in any case the amount they show in this episode wasnt very manywhat does this even mean the purpose of including salladhor earlier this season was to show stannis gathering forces for the battle which was clear and to introduce him before the battle so when one of his galleys rescues davos and so we know why he and davos are friendly on dragonstonethe fact that salladhor was left in the rear is not meaningful unless you pretend his later involvement doesnt exist and think thats the only way to justify the earlier scene which is not about showing a valuable or important character regardless even in the books salladhor being assigned to the rear is mentioned in all of one sentence of davos thinking about how imry florent doesnt trust him because he complains about not being paidsimply put they might have put in a line about salladhor being assigned to the rear in a previous episode but it wasnt important in the books wregards to the actual battle only to explaining how his ships were able to rescue survivors including davos and it certainly wasnt meaningful to the blackwater episode itself edited by ser hippie 30 may 2012  0933 pm"
"Paxmaniac",2012-05-30,"the feeling that stannis was attacking kings landing with 2300 soldiers and the defenders were about 50fyp realistically they did extremely well considering the budget but it really did feel like a handful of players on a very small setthe whole stannisthehero thing was just a little silly no commander no matter how brave or heroic is the first to climb a siege ladder the end was just absurd  tywin swans in with thousands of troops routing the siegers in a matter of minutes and stannis  who is still on the battlements is somehow dragged away my his bannermen gets back down a ladder finds a landing boat gets back to a ship that is still intact and makes it out of blackwater bay with enough of an army to crush a hundred thousands wildlings"

"The Original",2012-05-31,"they didnt need to show him this week then why on earth are you complaining after this weeks episodeif they drop salladhor saan altogether then you can complain if you already acknowledged that they dont need to waste time in an already packed hour to show salladhor in the back of the fleet going gee i wish i was fucking the queen right now then complaining that they havent shown him is simply being irrational and borderline asininethe show writers didnt drop the ball with salladhor saan not being shown at the battle because salladhor saan wasnt actively involved in the battle is the show supposed to show every single character that wasnt there just to prove to you that they arent dead"
"Hear Us Roar",2012-05-31,"the attack on tyrion was lame yo mean to tell me he swung but all he got was a small cut on his face that was enough to ko him i am fine with them not showing salladhor he will get a lot of time back at dragonstone"

"FloredaA—",2012-05-31,"while the episode was overall great there were a few things that stretched belief for me or could have been better   not enough defenses  tyrion guessed the attack would be on the mud gate yet there was no defenses on the beach id have put some wildfire pots half buried at the edge of the water that would get trampled by the landing soldiers pits and pikes are more basic things hed have found in his books granted stannis troups did not land where they intended to yet they had to approch the walls before putting ladders up the usual defense against ladders were arrowslits in the wall themselves allowing to shoot at the climbers though i can buy that for a reason or another dragons there are none in westeros  unprobable fire  shoot flame arrows on men dressed in half wet leather and they take flame immediatley  yeah right same with the boat used to protect the ram  one torch on hard wet wood and it goes up in flames like a ball of straw  overall while the wildfire explosion and fleet destruction was satisfyingly spectacular the fire on land was neither really explained even flame arrows have to find something combustible and yet not enough to scare the hound imo if not wildfire that bronn and tyrion thought too dangerous to use in the castle oil or pitch or something would have been handy  stannis leading the climb  the first man on the ladder is so obviously a dead one that i expect they had to draw lots to choose him while the king could and would lead an attack with a good guard around him heres the limit imo the lack of helmet is stupid too but more of a tv convention  horses  i understand the complexities and costs to work with horses especially in battles but at times it becomes ridiculous  here are knights in french chevaliers almost literaly horsemen whose whole point is that they fight on horses  that makes them able to bear armours that would be very impractical to walk with not to mention fight they are supposed to have horses aplenty in the castle stables and yet they attack a party of footmen who are superior in numbers and dont think of taking their horses  if tyou want to fight on foot send footmen knights without horses are in fact nearly useless azincourt cracy  tyrions speech  the soldiers crowd reaction was unbelievable as much as when they seem to loose faith they dont look desperate or afraid or ready to flee more like  oh well not funny anymore hey buddy what if we dropped that battle and went to have a pint and a game of cards and then their sudden enthusiasm totally fake  one very small detail  unless im wrong ive yet to see a crossbow in westeros a battle scene would have been the ocasion to show they do exist after all one will feature in some future season however the whole thing worked much better than i hoped especially considering we had been described something ten times larger more ships more fire more soldiers more confusion that was entirely impossible to recreate edited by floredaa 31 may 2012  0634 am"

"sarah.jenice",2012-05-31,"op thanks for this new topic to voice likes and dislikes of the episodei loved the episode so much and while i did notice most of the things that have been brought up iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve been trying to forgive the show because i am sure the majority of them had to do with budgettime constraints and talking to all of my friends who have never read the books they all loved the episode many saying it was the best yet and they honestly donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t even notice the small stuff we avid book readers pick up on i really think they are making an outstanding show that tells the heart of the story i love and i canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t wait for the finale and the next seasonsepic1 varys and tyrionâ<U+0080><U+0099>s scene â<U+0080><U+0093> we havenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t seen much of varys this season and this scene was one of my favorites his words about the tolling of the bells were haunting no one has really addressed melâ<U+0080><U+0099>s dark powers and this had to have many fans wondering what will happen if stannis wins with mel by his side i also loved his allusion to the story of his being cut and utter hatred of magic i canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t wait to see him tell tyrion his story2 sansa and cersei scenes â<U+0080><U+0093> they knocked these out of the park3 everything with tyrion â<U+0080><U+0093> from his funny dismissal of joffrey at the beginning of the battle to his speech to inspire the troops tyrion was incredible this episode as he has been all year i do agree that his scene with ser mandon turning on him was confusing and poorly executed my fianca had to get me to clarify what just happened and they made the cut look very much like it sliced his head through iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve seen several people reference the way selene kills victor in underworld in online blogs4 wildfire explosion â<U+0080><U+0093> iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve been wondering about the chain for weeks but i like this decision it was visually stunning gave you a feel of the utter devastation of most of stannis fleet and then really brought the horror home with the cuts between the chaos on the ships and the reactions of tyrion joff and the hound and you were still able to understand that some of stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099>s fleet was okay with the cut to him still kicking on a ship5 battle scenes â<U+0080><U+0093> the battle was brutal and those were some of the craziest kills on the show i loved it6 bronn â<U+0080><U+0093> singing shooting arrows and even saving the hound7 the hound â<U+0080><U+0093> his â<U+0080><U+009C>f the kingâ<U+0080><U+009D> to joff had me laughing uncontrollably and i really liked his tended moment with sansa i do think that scene was confusing to tvonly viewers because they canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t understand why sansa would have refused such a sweet deal to get to winterfell with such a strong knight to protect her they even had me wondering if they might have her go with him and eliminate dontos only for a moment because i know that wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have worked8 rains of castamere â<U+0080><U+0093> i watch with my mom and fianca who both havenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t read the books and they both looked at me crazy when i started jumping up and down going â<U+0080><U+009C>thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s the rains of castamereâ<U+0080><U+009D>my thoughts on a few of the negatives brought up and a couple of my own1 stannis being first up the ladder and over the wall â<U+0080><U+0093> yes i agree that this is an unlikely way for a commander to act but i think the show may have done it to give show stannis some likeable quality so fans will root for him so far this season i havenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t really liked show stannis and as we all know he is the only one of the five kings still currently standing come twow and i think his bravery and battle skill shown in blackwater will show tvonly fans that his is a qualified and worthy contender for the iron throne i thought it was a step in the right direction on stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099>s portrayal because my nonreader friends have hated him until they saw how badass he is i especially like him hanging over the prow of the rowboat like he couldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t wait for his chance to jump into action2 stanniss exit  i did think this was confusing as ive seen people who even think he was captured by the lannisters i guess once we all see him safe at dragonstone they will better explain how exactly he got off the wall into a rowboat and back to a ship with tywin and tyrell armies all around3 lack of horses â<U+0080><U+0093> iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve noticed this all season not just in the battle but robb and talisa walking to the crag too and iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve seen where the producers said theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve had trouble getting horses but the borgias on showtime has tons of horses in each episode maybe theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve taken them all â<U+0080><U+0093> showtime let hbo borrow some horses please it does make things less believable but i think they carried out the battle on foot really well4 lack of salladhor â<U+0080><U+0093> iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve been missing salla too but i have to agree with the posters who were not bothered with his absence here because it could be explained later i was mainly upset that they left out his story of aa to davos after stannis gets lightbringer maybe they thought it was too early to go into heavy mythology and are saving it for next season and i could understand if that is when they want to utilize his character other than having him say funny but overall pointless lines about wanting to rape cersei since the beginning of stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099>s storm of swords chapters deal with him regrouping and the prophecy and what mel thinks he should do leech burning kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s blood numerous speeches on him being the chosen one i could see them holding off going into the aa legend until then but i would be really disappointed if it is fully removed from the show iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve got so many theories based on what salla tells davos and i donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t want all that thinking to be for nothing5 small scale of the battle â<U+0080><U+0093> i agree that at least one sweeping shot that showed the full scale of the battle would have been nice all of the ships or troops but i think that they made up for it by orienting the action around characters we cared about instead of seeing a bunch of random guys killing each other we got to see characters we know in the heat of battle and a lot of tvonly viewers were certain they were in mortal danger which is exactly what the show was aiming for6 what the battle change will mean for davoss storyline  since the wildfire bomb ship knocked davos out of the picture so quickly do you all still think he will blame mel for the loss of the battle and his son thanks to fire i know that will only affect his early stormseason 3 storyline but ive been wondering if they will still go forward with that i liked his interaction with mel when he is arrested because it gives more insight on her powers and i would be a little let down if the cutchange that another gripe along those lines is that weve barely gotten to know davos or stannis for that matter to really care about their fates on the show i really hope they can find a way to give them more screen time so the audience will better understand who they are and why we should care about their fatessorry for the long post but this is the first time ive voiced all of my comments on the episode biggrinpng classbbcemoticon altd "

"LÂ<U+0092>Age dÂ<U+0092>or",2012-05-29,"i think the main reason was due to the fact that they wanted stannis fighting in the vanguard and personally seeing to the task of taking the city he would not be able to retreat if the chain was there"

"Natmus",2012-05-29,"hey avid reader of the books hereive never quite understood how the chain worked someone explain it to methe chain was so to speak the anvil and the hulks with wildfire were the hammerto sum up the situation in the books even with a great deal of troops on stannis large fleet stannis had even more troops waiting on the southern bank of the blackwater rush so stannis fleet had several missions in the assault land the troops on the ships to establish a beachhead on the nothern bank of the blackwater engage and defeat joffreys fleet transport the troops on the southern bank to the northern bank to reinforce the assault on kings landingwhile the trick with the wildfire compare it to a very successfull fireship attack is bad enough and destroy many ships a significant part of stannis fleet could have manouvered out in the bay and avoided the wildfire if not for the chain raised behind them waited for the wildfire to burn away then sailed back in and continued moving troops from the south bank to the north bank the chain trapped almost all of stannis fleet to be destroyed even so in the books some of the trapped ships evaded destruction due to the random movements of wildfire and currentwithout the chain a lot more of stannis ships would have survived the blackwater and one can imagine that stannis them could have evacuated more men when the tyrelllannister army attacked him leaving him with more men than he currently have where the books standsin the show all stannis men are aboard the fleet so there is no need to hold the river the entire fleet just tries to get the troops ashore different circumstances leading to different defensive tactics"
"The Owl",2012-05-29,"i didnt miss the chain and its absence went nicely with the move from a day batte to a night oneit worked well either way"
"DirtyRobes",2012-05-29,"no but we did get tyrions hand chain in this episode i do wonder if it occurred to the writers that they would be forced to omit one of tyrions important chains and so decided to wait till this episode as a wink to readers in cok he does have it made quite early on i believe this is the first time its seen onscreenanyone confirm ive been trying to find it all season"

"FloredaA—",2012-05-31,"yes the main difference in the books is the scope of things  while in the show one phantom boat is enough to destroy about half of stannis fleet though its night and we never see how many boats he had and how many are destroyed and make nice fireworks in the books tyrion sacrifices a few good boats of the royal fleet to make the feint more believable plus its daylight the books are much more detailed and allow us to know exactly how many boats the width of the river the laying of the troops etc meaning the tactics have to be more thought out and believable edited by floredaa 31 may 2012  0643 am"

"TeamDanyArya",2012-05-28,"not that i think we need this thread quite yet but since there was one started for episode 8 and i suggested one of these get started for each episode ill give it a go we have nitpicky threads for each epiosde lets have a gusher thread im not one for long posts so ill try to keep this brief really this was just epic awesomeness from the start to finish cersei  ahhh her armor new meaning to breastplate her wine fueled speech to the ladies with the contrast of sansas innocence and rallying of the ladies was welldone her sitting on the throne with tommen at the end had me close to crying in an episode that had me on the edge of my seat and her telling pycelle to go away was nice sansa  it really showed off how understated and i think underappreciated sophie turner is doing with sansa she isnt one of my favorites but i do enjoy the actress and the shows take on her and her dialogue with joffery her sarcastic responses and his slow to pick up on it reaction were wellplayed joffery  gods is he a little prick i loved his expression as he realized he might have to fight after all some vunerability from the secondcoming of mad king aerys tyrion  hes tyrion what can you say scared and brave at the same time varys  he only needs one scene to make an impact i love how he was on the verge of tears when he was talking to tyrion especially when talking about the dark arts and mel i wonder if he knows mel he is the master of knowledge after all stannis  not one of my favs but i dig the actor playing him makes you almost root for him as king tywin and loras  leave the viewer wondering why a tyrell is next to a lannister good cliffhanger for nonbook readers sets up the next season quite nicely and ive always loved tywins armor it suites that character well the hound  i almost lost it as he looked around at all the fire the fear on his face and his willingness to just leave was great and i liked the scene with sansa less creepy than in the books in the books i feared sansa would be raped but in the show it played out better sansa gained a lot of courage in this episode and confronted a couple of her fears joffery and the hound the battle scenes  boom so glad i have surround sound i dont think ive ever seen a tv show attempt anything like that and try to make it look as good as possible they dont have a hollywood budget and they did a fantastic job it looked movie quality and i dont think anyone else could ever pull that off mad props to hbo for doing it and doing it well"
"Noelle Snow",2012-05-28,"im amazed that even with that epicness theres a nitpick thread no we didnt get the chain and we didnt get the song from sansa etc but seriously i didnt see one thing that was a flaw in that episode perfect from start to finish the acting the writing the effects the cinematography the direction everything and i think as much as we should heap praise on grrm for giving us this brilliance we need to give props to dd for working so hard to even get to this point and to hbo for having enough faith to even expand their budget for this one episode give it up for everyone applause"
"victim",2012-05-29,"apart from the wildfire and stannis being a badass and the other obvious stuff my favourite thing in the episode has to be joffrey when he says what did my mother say exactly did she have urgent business with me wow hes looking for any excuse no matter how weak to get the heck away from the battle his voice was cracking oh my gods i cannot get over it other than that  sansas doll  i saw you kill a man with a shield youll be unstoppable with an axe  bronn  that is exactly how i imagined cersei would be when she is drunk  head explosion via rock  the hound being afraid of the fire was houndled perfectly sorry  and pod there really is so many more"

"sennahoj",2012-05-29,"joffrey and tyrion having a conversation on the battlements with the aid of lancel und the hound was just terribly funny as well as the punchline that would make me the quarterman classic"
"Dannyisnow",2012-05-29,"that episode was absolutely sublime im not one to point out flaws and complain at minor changes but if i did wish to be that way i dont think i could with this episode it was fantastic  the highlights for me were of course the wildfire explosion  which made me physically woah  the battle scenes were immense and i thought the bronn and hound undertone was particularly good  i dont think i picked that up in the books too much so if its been added i like it   one of the things i most liked was the evolution of characters sansa finally took control of herself cersei proving shes not bullet proof and the hounds absolute terror at fire and we even got a glimpse that maybe he has a pinch of affection somewhere otherwise we saw joffrey for what he really is a coward however i think nonreaders had that one already established tonguepng classbbcemoticon altp  stannis the fearless king leading the way until the very end having to be dragged away and of course tyrion the lion i cant wait for next weeks finale i have a feeling things will tie together and certain book changes that have received many criticisms will come back around bringing the show back in line with where it needed to be with the books"
"BastardPoetry",2012-05-29,"i created an account just to share my excitement over this episode and how great it was neil marshall is a complete genius when it comes to working with a budget 11000th the size of a lotr budget and making it look just as good ive been lurking here for quite awhile and i know a lot of people get upset over the little things that dd might be doing wrong but i feel its important to praise them for the overall work theyve done this series is spectacular and you can really tell that they love the source material as much as we do little changes are made for the budget for the time limits or for viewerfriendliness in general but the passion is still there plus im one of those people who sees every alteration as either a good change at best or an understandable one at worst finally i made a poster to express my excitement over blackwater its a spoiler if you havent seen the episode yetbut why would you be reading the praise for episode 9 thread if you havent seen it yet honestly ill just put the link itself rather than an img tag because its fairly bighttpi47tinypiccomizrz7sjpg"

"Ferrum Aeternum",2012-05-27,"perfectly fine with it if they make the scar nasty enough the wound most certainly looked nasty all that really matters is that his face is visibly permanently disfigured i think dd know the importance of this even if the limitations of television make an actor losing half his nose impractical"

"House Snow",2012-05-27,"it think people are underestimating how hard the nose cgi is they refer to boardwalk empire but if you watch it the guy only takes the mask off when he still or moves just a little and i think thats deliberately due to the limitations of the cgi"
"King Rickon",2012-05-27,"yeah it would be stupid to remove half of tyrions nose as it would be time consuming and expensive and for what just give him a scar and move on having half of his nose missing doesnt effect what happens to tyrion having tywin come back to kings landing does he just needs to be unconscious for a few days and all will be well"

"Nuttz",2012-05-28,"it was definitely obvious enough that he was attacked by a member of the kingsguard i watch most episodes with my brother and he picked up on it he was shocked this is coming from someone who didnt know who the wildlings were and needed me to tell him btw"
"Golden Twin",2012-05-28,"i really want them to chop off half his nose he is so ugly in the books tv tyrion does not even have mismatching eyes and ugly ears also why arent his hair white it does seem important for a possible ahem future revelation"
"Honey Badger",2012-05-28,"you can definitely tell the people who are book readers but dont understand television nose cgi is out of the question facial prosthetics followed by makeup painted on top would be a significant investment to daily shoots peter would need to show up at 4am every morning to get all that makeup done ala michael dorn when he played worf plus remember that hes a dwarf any makeup team needs to be careful about making him look like a cartoon character or alien this is fantasy not scifi hbo deliberately chose not to make the tyrion character look grotesque with mismatched eyes as there are practical considerations hell get some light scar makeup to note the permanent disfigurement and move on maybe 2530 minutes in the makeup chair instead of the usual 15"
"addie",2012-05-28,"i will be fine if hes left with a big scar on his face he needs to have a remarkable mark to be noticeabble among all the other dwwarfs talking of varys i never really got why he talks of daenerys to tyrion in the last episode while hes is supposed to be a targ supporter and work for her anyway great episode"

"Apoapsis",2012-05-28,"i just hope both tyrion and davos dont appear next episode that would be awesomeyou want seasonspanning cliffhangers why"
"Maithanet",2012-05-28,"in the books it is unclear whether mandon moore was sent by cersei or joffrey i go back and forth on this but theres evidence and arguments to be made each way but in the show i think its pretty obviously joffery tyrion hasnt done anything to really warrant murder from cersei he didnt kidnap tommen and threaten him with rape he didnt poison cersei to keep her out of council meetings for a while and as far as she knows she has great leverage over him by kidnapping his whoregirlfriend cersei has been generally less ruthless in the show as well than in the books joff on the other hand is more willing to kill and order people killed he did it to ned he did it to the bastards and he loves ordering people to fight to the death tyrion slapped him several times in public and talks down to him constantly joffery does not abide this sort of slight i think hes clearly the prime suspect in the show like the book i imagine we wont find out who sent ser mandon moore but i think its a little odd that people are pointing at cersei as if shes obviously the one if i were coming to the show for the first time id say joff is clearly the guy"
"Greywolf2375",2012-05-28,"like the book i imagine we wont find out who sent ser mandon moore but i think its a little odd that people are pointing at cersei as if shes obviously the one if i were coming to the show for the first time id say joff is clearly the guyyes based on what were given in the show cersei doesnt like him but this act would be a stretch joffrey being upstaged by him slapped and insulted multiple times makes more sense based on what they have had joffrey do to others to this pointthat said i do hope we dont see him til next year would love that as a cliffhanger"
"Mack Kilimaro",2012-05-28,"id always assumed it was cersei who set ser mandon to dispose of tyrion in the books as well the show plays it more as either commanded by joffrey or inspired by joffrey what was it he said ser mandon and ser boras will represent the king on the battlefield that sounds pretty laden with innuendo to me like joffs just ordered tyrions death without tyrion knowing it working against that thought is the idea that joff himself was so overwhelmed with cowardice from seeing some of the realities of war that he wouldnt strike me as having the confidence to order a hit he talks big but when it hits the fan hes nowhere to be found"
"Xanrn",2012-05-28,"well if you have read all the books varys either was using dany from the start or changed his mind when he found out she actually had dragons the epilogue from a dance with dragons makes it clear who he wants on the iron throne"

"victim",2012-05-21,"speaking of mandon moore  i noticed mandon moore got a good mention by cersei in the tyrionros scene and after it i was expecting to see him a little bit more to set up the character before next episode we didnt though and now it seems to be little more than a reference to a character currently being played by a featured extra so how should his betrayal of tyrion unfold in next weeks episode well chances are it wont and i can recall someone suggesting meryn trant should take his place which seems like a good enough idea  audiences have already seen him being a lacklustre guardsmen who follows cersei and joffrey unquestionably while also having a general dislike for tyrion so this idea makes sense and is helped by the fact that audiences probably already dislike the fellow yet the mention had to be for some reason outside of adding a little bit to the world cersei could have said ser arys or ser boros to get audiences more familiar with characters who become important later so im thinking that perhaps moore has been cast for a kind of oneepisode arc where he is told it is his duty to protect tyrion only to betray him for cersei i cant see any other point of him being mentioned outside of this and its in many small ways similar to mentioning the bastard of bolton what we do know however is how vital that scene is to tyrions storyline so im pretty sure its going to happen as in im not expecting him to run into battle only be accidentally knocked unconscious again i guess it all depends on how much exposition at kings landing we get before the actual battle begins"

"Ciglon",2012-05-23,"update when i noticed someone posting a new summary for ep 10 i went to same site and noticed something interesting when you look at the cast for blackwater it does appear that well at least get a bit of jon snows storyline other episodes appear to have cast listed specific to the episode this one features almost exclusively klblackwater related people except jon snow and ygritte if nothing more perhaps ghost will finally show up and cause a little havoc to free halfhand and jon so we get our proper closing for that story line in ep 10 httpwwwtvcomshkwater2385432hmm it does seem like well be getting 1 or 2 scenes with jon and ygritte then at least according to tvcomi think this makes sense so that viewers will have something to really look forward to in the finale aside from danywinterfella bit of arya resolution i dont think the small comment the halfhand made to jon really sufficed to let the viewers know what the plan is for jon they need to reiterate that jon is going to have to try and infiltrate the wildling camp by turning cloak just a small scene next episode will remindinform the tvonly viewers of that and really get them excited to see his resolution in the finale"

"Arkash",2012-05-23,"yeah but i remembered liam cunnigham saying something like melisandre throws davos in a cell somewhere so im assuming we will have a scene on last episode where davos is rescued by a ship and a second one where he arrives at dragonstone to kill melisandre and is taken by the guards"

"Ciglon",2012-05-25,"also i do think as someone mentioned that the safe will contain money to buy the unsullied because in the show obviously dany has no money whatsoever whereas in the books she did have some money from gifts and selling them etc even thgouth she lost a bit bribing people although i suppose its not a huge problem since they could just say she had money to buy the unsullied from illyrios ships anyways obviously whatevers in the vault cant really be anything of real importance to the plot later on which just makes me more curious"

"iheartseverus",2012-05-25,"someone mentioned idea of doreah appearing with drogon indeed maybe she managed to escape pyat pree and hides somewhere with drogon i doubt escaping him would be possible but who knowsim pretty sure when we saw that closing scene of the hooded figure carrying the cages of baby dragons on his back there were only two dragon tails dangling out of the cages and neither one of them looked black my theory is doreah heard the death and slaughter going on outside danys quarters and only had time to snatch one of the dragons and run with it before the thieves broke in she has drogon and theyre both in hiding thats my spitball and im sticking to it"

"Ciglon",2012-05-26,"well for that ending scene i think theyll most likely chop the whole scheming plot aspect of that chapter in order to maybe show more dolorous edd and pyp and grenn to familiarize the audience with them not to mention they still have to show the dragonglass to the lc etc and theyll definitely have the three horn blasts and have sam say again like three blasts look of horror thats only for white walkers dun dun fade to black with regards to tomorrows episode do you guys expect well see tyrion killing plenty of good stannis men or will they not involve him too much in the action so that hes looking around a lot more we havent seen any badass gritty tyrion in the show yet just a joking clever and sometimes serious one who doesnt get the opportunity to get his hands dirty should be interesting also i hope we get to see the hound of course sansan scene whatever but esp his fear of fire that would be a brilliant scene showing the hound being afraid and later drunk for the first time of many upcoming scenes in the show rory mccann is just so excellent as the hound the nonbook readers are really getting his character and hes nailed the part so far imo"

"SerMixalot",2012-05-26,"also i do think as someone mentioned that the safe will contain money to buy the unsullied because in the show obviously dany has no money whatsoever whereas in the books she did have some money from gifts and selling them etc even thgouth she lost a bit bribing people although i suppose its not a huge problem since they could just say she had money to buy the unsullied from illyrios ships anyways obviously whatevers in the vault cant really be anything of real importance to the plot later on which just makes me more curiousif there is gold in the vault and she takes it that will be a huge change to her character if she buys the unsullied with it the trickery she used to get the unsullied is critical to the story imo"

"Ciglon",2012-05-26,"if there is gold in the vault and she takes it that will be a huge change to her character if she buys the unsullied with it the trickery she used to get the unsullied is critical to the story imofor the record i wasnt suggesting she will buy unsullied with only gold from the vault in the books she didnt just trade drogon for the army she offered to trade all the gold she had not a lot along with the ships and everything in them then the wise masters said thats a start well trade for all thatand a dragon so in staying true to the book she would still be able to use the trickery you spoke of if she had gold in fact it would be more true to the story since dany did indeed leave qarth with more gold than when she entered it from gifts not shown in the program edited by ciglon 26 may 2012  0720 pm"

"King Tommen",2012-05-26,"simple answer for disappointment is because i want to see it because it would be great tv flashback descriptions arent exactly exciting tv showing the actual events as they happen is a lot cooler i understand we didnt have the battle in the books that is exactly why id love to see it because this is tv they can do things and show things that grrm didnt in the books since the whole three blasts thing also happened in asos im not sure what your issue is here im basically saying that in addition to the prologue they actually show us a bit of the chaos and sam killing an other this is not a serious jump forward just showing a little something more that we didnt get in the booksi would rather see the chaos and some action than just hear some horns someone scream white walkers and fade to black thats very cheap for tv it works in the book because its a prologue and we know well get more later though it does take 250 pages having us see sam slay a white walker is completely within the narrative given that sam just told us about the dragonglass getting to see what its used for makes 100 narrative sense and as far as this not being in acok the whole three blasts isnt in acok either so i dont understand that argument theyre already pulling from asos if they include the three blastsif you are following the book narrative sam doesnt kill a white walker at the fist the night watch gets demolished and they all run off on foot separately for days on end and eventually many are caught by white walkers and wights from behind sam only kills the walker that comes on he and small paul in the woods on the way back to crasters keep in desperation after not being able to walk after days and days of running that would be a very prolongued method of having your final scene ending just so you can show sam killing a white walker and it also kind of deflates the whole mystery of the walkers at the same time about a minute after reintroducing themas far as what is good or bad tv what seems a more dramatic finish to the season1 an intimate conversation between sam grenn dolorous edd and perhaps mormont interupted suddenly by 1 horn blast a quick question by sam about whether jon is returning a 2nd blast where they all scramble to defend themselves against the wildlings that the audience also believes are coming due to revealing mances camp in a very recent scene and then utter horror and deer in the headlights look on all of them when the 3rd blast arrives if you wanted to you could also pan back and show the walkers approaching up the base of the fist as the music climaxes fade to blackor2 everything above and then a bunch of fights everyone runs away they are tracked for days and sam stabs and kills one of the unstoppable killing machines and we say see you next yearguess which scene will have more fans talking throughout the course of the year leading up to next seasons premiere edited by king tommen 26 may 2012  0728 pm"

"Ciglon",2012-05-26,"after hearing that the director for blackwater is neil marshall who was responsible for the excellent film centurion a year back im a bit more confident that the battle will really be pretty badass especially considering that the budget for centurion was something like 11 million american dollars which is nuts for a motion picture not too much more than what was spent on blackwater id wager also interesting to note liam cunningham davos was also in that film he was one of the romans and died in that last epic battle iirc so im sure that having worked together before will really increase the ease and flow between them and davos scenes should be nothing short of spectacular tomorrow night biggrinpng classbbcemoticon altd  also anyone have any ideas how stannis will escape since it looked like he was on shore in the preview the nonbook readers ive talked to seem to agree that stannis will likely win having the upper hand and joffrey being a villain and all i wonder if maybe well actually see the scene with axell florent telling stannis the day is lost and them running off onto a ship would make for a great scene stannis looking over at the city he almost won admitting defeat"

"K.C.",2012-05-27,"lots of hints in last episode that the chain may be gone and replaced by another solution the pig shit reference was pretty obvious in the sense that the wildfire will play a big part note the placement of the discussion of tyrion managing the lannistar toilets for those years which is true i wonder if all three of these are going to come together somehow tyrion will pour all the wildfire down the crappers of the red keep and set the whole bay aflame hope theyve got good lids on those johhnysother than that the fact that theres no river passing anywhere near the castle in dubrovnic is a pretty good reason that they may have been forced to make a plot shift you also get the sense that when the boats land they are coming in from the ocean directly by the speed and force in the books it would have been much different i think and they would have been paddling upstreammaybe stannis will land and then watch his whole fleet go up in flames behind him shot at night which theyve done will look pretty awesomewhen varys i think asked what do we have and tyrion said pig shit i figured he meant joffreys inspiring presence on the battlefield winkpng classbbcemoticon alt "

"protar",2012-05-27,"well it would have been nice if it was there but ofcourse it wasnt an option i think the people who say we absolutely need it to see him as a hero or whatever are being a bit dramatic like you said tyrion has his other moments of awesomeness in the battle which we should love him more foras if he needs more love from the tv show fans and very few people gave him credit for the chain in the books anyway so its not like his character will be ruined in the show because its goneyeah but thats kind of the whole point that no one gives him credit its his first step into becoming the much more bitter person we see in adwd but yeah so long as tyrion comes up with some master plan eg flushing the wildfire down the sewers and gets no credit then i dont mind the lack of chain"
"House Snow",2012-05-27,"hopefully not to the ridiculous jumping from ship to ship extent he was in the books not that i could see that happening its impossible for a dwarf to do such things so theyd need to use special effectslol i forgot about that im sort of glad they have tempered the general supernatural badassness of all the characters at this point most of it would be hard to believe on screen at this point"

"Arbor Gold I'm Sold",2012-05-27,"yeah i dont think theyd introduce dontos and not have him play a part in the story later on hell most likely try to help her in season 3 since people forget dd said that they are moving some things back and some things forward its now an adaption of the whole saga not just bookperseason as many tend to believe still it may have been the case for season 1 but it was much smaller in scope and more focused on a central character than season 2 and beyondi think it has been this way the whole time if you recall catelyns interrogation of jaime in the first season that didnt happen until the end of book 2"
