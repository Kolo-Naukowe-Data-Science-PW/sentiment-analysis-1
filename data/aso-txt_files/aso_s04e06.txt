"Ran",2014-05-11,"nonspoiler discussion of the show goes here for those whove not read the books or those who have but are happy to not actually reference them at all in discussion taking each episode as it comes this topic should open automatically when the show begins airing"
"AryaSansa",2014-05-11,"wow why did tyrion get so angryâ he should have realized shae was testifying under duressâ and why would he demand a trial by combat hes going to lose â and why did yara run away from some dogsâ the ironborn should have been stronger i expected more from themâ they had shields too â didnt like this episode was kind of boring"
"tricky92",2014-05-11,"are you kidding me the last 5 minutes gave me chills i never read the books but its so obvious and so genius what tyrion has up his sleeve its going to be epic"
"AryaSansa",2014-05-11,"what does tyrion have up his sleeveâ bronn â i cant imagine who will be on the other side"
"tricky92",2014-05-11,"what does tyrion have up his sleeveâ bronn â i cant imagine who will be on the other side â the previews have taken a little bit of the mystery out of it if you have followed them closely since before the season started â but there are two things you need to ask yourself â 1 who is the one man that tywin will call on to champion for him â and â 2 who is the one man that tyrion will call on that will not turn down an opportunity to fight the man that tywin will no doubt call on edited by tricky92 11 may 2014  1042 pm"
"OccupyHarrenhal",2014-05-11,"wow why did tyrion get so angryâ he should have realized shae was testifying under duressâ â yes the duress that he put her through not anything from tywin or his men if you recall the only way he could convince her to leave kings landing was to insult and reject her and she very much took it to heart"
"Winterfell is Burning",2014-05-12,"what does tyrion have up his sleeveâ bronn â i cant imagine who will be on the other side â if you figure out who will cersei pick youll figure out who will be tyrions champion"
"Fantasy Character",2014-05-12,"small question  who was the person sitting to lorass left at the trial they kept cutting to the tyrells and it was from screen l to r margaery loras some other dude edited by fantasy character 12 may 2014  0109 am"
"ambi76",2014-05-12,"an extra in tyrell clothing omfg this means there are other male tyrells"
"AryaSansa",2014-05-12,"â if you figure out who will cersei pick youll figure out who will be tyrions champion â cersei chooses jaimeâ then tyrion chooses bronn â then they fight for real"
"AryaSansa",2014-05-12,"â yes the duress that he put her through not anything from tywin or his men if you recall the only way he could convince her to leave kings landing was to insult and reject her and she very much took it to heart â poor shae â scorned by her lover and coerced by cersei to lie against her willâ i feel sorry for her"
"AryaSansa",2014-05-12,"didnt like the yara sceneâ they had 50 men i expected more from the best killers of the iron islandsâ guess their bark is worse than their bite â they should have killed the dogs in the cagesâ just stick a sword through the cageâ i thought ironborn were more fearless but i guess not â and why was ramsey fighting nakedâ what were those cuts from sexâ i didnt see any knives in the sex scenesâ â â ramsay is so ugly too his eyes are so big and he has a super wide mouth and big nose and curly weird hair â best part of the show was the dragon"
"SerArthurHeath",2014-05-12,"â cersei chooses jaimeâ then tyrion chooses bronn â then they fight for real jaime would say no hes already refused to kill tyrion for cersei"
"SerArthurHeath",2014-05-12,"though the huge contrast between someone who has not read the books and everyone who has regarding this episode and the characters mentioned is fascinating thanks for the insight"
"andurilflameofthewest",2014-05-12,"tyrions always managed to keep his cool say the right things â but when shae took the stand â  that was ithe flipped his lid"
"Alizard Erebys",2014-05-12,"if tywin and tryion both have to pic a champion could it be that tywin picks the mountain and tyrion then chooses oberyn â oberyn kills the mountain et voila "
"AryaSansa",2014-05-12,"why would tywin chooseâ i think if tywin chose hed choose an easy fighter so tyrion can live and jaime can go to casterly rock â but if cersei chooses shell choose jaime or someone better  but that person must be willingâ maybe cersei can somehow convince jaime to fightâ but tyrions pick is definitely bronnâ i guess it could be oberynn since that guy does nothing except have sexâ why would the show introduce him just to have sex he must be there for a reason â i guess if mountain was chosen oberynn would be the guy since he mentioned wanting revenge in the first episode â but tywin needs tyrion alive so jaime can go back so he should just choose an easy opponent against tyrionâ too bad ser dontos isnt aroundâ â did i mention how much of a letdown yara wasâ 50 best killers guess the best of the ironborn was about the same skill level as a regular dreadfort person and much less than some dogs"
"SerArthurHeath",2014-05-12,"tywins a judge not the accuserprosecution so im not sure he can name the prosecutions champion"
"Kiporman",2014-05-12,"if tywin and tryion both have to pic a champion could it be that tywin picks the mountain and tyrion then chooses oberyn â oberyn kills the mountain et voila  â nah im positive that tyrions going to choose jaime â i mean it makes sense since the beggining of this season jaime is training to recover his skillatarms maybe he is not in the best league now but it doenst matter  he is tywins heir if tyrion has jaime as champion tywin is fucked tyrion only loses if jaime dies so if tyrion dies jaime dies and if jaime lives tyrion walks free and if tyrion walks free mind you not only he would be free from tywins control it would also means that essentialy everything they arranged would be proven as bullshit for the world to see which means that no matter what happens tywins gonna lose â looking really foward for this"
"Alizard Erebys",2014-05-12,"ok so given that tyrion is accused by cersei if he asks a trial by combat that means him vs her in any case tywin wants tyrion alive or he loses everything hes held by the balls â we can reasonably assume that cersei will name a champion as she wants tyrion dead tyrion can either name a champion to win and be free or stand for himself thus provoking tywin into acting â i dont know if there is an order in who pics the champion but both may want to choose jaime cersei can pick him to corner tyrion who would face a dilemma tyrion could answer by standing for himself thus puttin tywin in an impossible situation and force him to do something tyrion can pic jaime to corner cersei and tywinâ â i think that either way picking jaime will give explosive outcomes â if cersei wants to ensure victory picking gregor clegane would seem only normal because hes the most fearful bannerman of the lannister in this situation tyrion wont even have to beg oberyn to step in for him â well you can always imagine surprises with characters that were not really in the spotlight lately cersei could pick loras tyrell to get rid of him and piss off the tyrell she could pic one of the kingsguard same for tyrion â what are your thoughts"
"CroS13",2014-05-12,"non book reader here picking jamie is too much of a liability for tyrion because he will loose and you cant bet on tywin to step in and overrule the trial when would he step in and do something when jamie has a sword through the chest â either way if tyrion picks jamie they both die which would stick it to the man so to speak but what good is that when your dead tyrion has repeatadly said that he has no intention of dying just yet anyway â cersei wants tyrion dead at all costs so picking jamie is not a good idea either i have got the vibe they arnt as close since he returned to the capital with the whole you left me thing also i dont think the rape done anything to gain rapport with her perhaps she also wants him dead but not as much as tyrion â either way tywin is in a pretty crappy position where its either one of his sons or both could die â i think cersei will pick the one person who can guarantee that tyrion dies and that is the lannisters most feared bannerman the mountain as others have said i doubt that tyrion would even need to ask oberyn but the question remains if he can fight or not i cant remember if his reputation in fighting precedes him but id assume so â cant believe people thought the episode was boring not all the scenes can be about tavern wenches and great battles with dragons and white walkers â oh and bronn is not going to chosen dam it"
"Alizard Erebys",2014-05-12,"everything you say makes sense â we can also imagine a bronn vs jaime duel that would mirror the training scenes they had â but the duel wouldnt be interesting as jaime stands no chance â tywin may not overrule the trial but we dont know how far he can bend the rules to ensure his positionâ"
"MaximumPatlickicus",2014-05-12,"what exactly did bronn say when tyrion asked him if hed gotten shae off on the boat i dont remember the specifics but at the time i remember feeling very skeptical and that bronn did a lot of not explicitily saying yea shes on the boat and shes gone for good â â i think bronn has ceased to be tyrions guy â â â â"
"Alizard Erebys",2014-05-12,"he said hed seen her on the ship the tyrion asks if hes seen the ship sail away and bronn avoids the questions saying shes fine now go drink â so yes when i saw this moment i thought things werent over with shae yet â next episode may tell us if bronn is still in tyrions service"
"xBradzx",2014-05-13,"non book reader here my immediate reaction was that tyrion would get bron to fight anyone they picked â however oberyn vs the mountain could be the real outcome so oberyn can get revenge he wants and he is supposed to be a deadly fighter"
"tricky92",2014-05-13,"plus in previews for this season and next week we keep getting glimpses of the mountain â also in the season preview theres a shot of oberyn in some sort of battle wheres hes pulling off some acrobatic maneuvers â im not sure how the logistics are going to work out but it seems pretty obvious that the trial by combat is going to come down to oberyn vs the mountain"
"Thrones123",2014-05-13,"after everything that has happened to theon cant blame him too much but he is a little bitch â now hes going to pretend to escape or whatever and go to that one castle ramsey is trying to take over and somehow let them in â and yeah the ironborn were pretty weak can imagine dogs being tough to fight but you are just going to run away right when it happens â danys storyline is still pretty weak guess its supposed to show how she is struggling with her newfound power she is trying to rule in mereen but what about the other cities â expected to see something about the nights watch with john returning to the wall and gaining more power maybe that will happen next episode â oberyn vs the mountain is definitely going to be the two that fight just a matter of how it ends up that way"
"Kirijax",2014-05-13,"first time poster here been watching the series from japan love this series and finally had to start reading the books although im still in the first book have no idea who tyrion will pick but the chapter title for episode eight is the mountain and the viper isnt oberyn known as the red viper or something because he puts poison on his swords when he fights or am i getting him mixed up with someone else that fight would be epic cant wait to see tywins face whenif oberyn agrees to fight for tyrionâ â a hand to hand fight between cersei and tyrion themselves would be the most entertaining though"
"orthorim",2014-05-14,"what exactly did bronn say when tyrion asked him if hed gotten shae off on the boat i dont remember the specifics but at the time i remember feeling very skeptical and that bronn did a lot of not explicitily saying yea shes on the boat and shes gone for good â â i think bronn has ceased to be tyrions guy â â â â â bronn never denied the fact that hed work for money not for anyone in particular but for those who paid him so i think its a pretty safe bet he did work for tywin when deciding to hand over shae i imagine his choice was to either take the gold or die bronn took the goldâ â then again theres the unpredictable shae  she might very well have been put on the boat safely as promised only to bail at the last minute she might even have decided voluntarilyâ to testify against tyrion in exchange for safety  given her testimony at the trial shes completely lost it she had to say certain things to keep her end of the bargain obviously  but there were plenty of things she did not have to say hell hath no fury like a woman scorned"
"TheButcherCrow",2014-05-14,"a hand to hand fight between cersei and tyrion themselves would be the most entertaining though im sure by entertaining you meant awkward  embarrassing for all involved"
"orthorim",2014-05-14,"non book reader here my immediate reaction was that tyrion would get bron to fight anyone they picked â however oberyn vs the mountain could be the real outcome so oberyn can get revenge he wants and he is supposed to be a deadly fighter â yeah that would be the most sensible thing  and incredibly clever of tyrion in my mind theres no doubt who would win it was mentioned that oberyn is a fearsome fighter weve seen a glimpse of his skill in the brothel scene where he stabbed some lannister in the hand mountain and the viper for ep 8 seems a dead giveaway  after all oberyn is only going to win through speed and smarts  though hopefully not actual poison  against the mountain the mountain is huge and impressive but hes got to be slow at that size and hes dumb as a sack of rocksâ i seem to remember too that oberyn gave some sort of speech in the brothel about the importance of speedâ â even if they were evenly matched fighters  and the mountain sure is fantastic at killing other knights in tournaments  the advantage would lie with oberyn hes got a cause in fact this is the opportunity of his lifetime to avenge his sisterâ â if tempers run too high somebody might choose jamie but as has been said jamie will refuse to fight to kill his brother and tyrion wont choose him when he has oberyn just itching to kill somebodyâ â total speculation  i wont ever read the books it would take away half the fun in watching my most favorite show ever  but i think cersei will choose jamie he refuses then she chooses the mountain as thats the best fighter available then tyrion chooses oberyn and things will get awesome â ps if this is the ep 8 title then whats ep 7 an hour of denaerys running through the desert ugh"
"valirpaz",2014-05-25,"total speculation  i wont ever read the books it would take away half the fun in watching my most favorite show ever see and im considering starting to read because once this season is done im not sure i can wait all the time until the next season â â but i think cersei will choose jamie he refuses then she chooses the mountain as thats the best fighter available then tyrion chooses oberyn and things will get awesome i agree the fight will be mountain vs oberyn for reasons that have already been mentioned but i can not see cersei choosing jamie he only has his left hand and apart from tyrion and bronn nobody knows hes even practising with it therefore she would have to think hed lose choosing jamie thus would mean for cersei to lose her one brother and father of the king and at the same time have tyrion going free shes evil not dumb â ps if this is the ep 8 title then whats ep 7 an hour of denaerys running through the desert ugh i know were now all waiting for this fight but thats a little bit of an exaggeration we have arya brann jon possibly the wildlings the vale  you could fill an episode with them without kings landing without denaerys  and yeah the ironborn were pretty weak can imagine dogs being tough to fight but you are just going to run away right when it happens i agree with that picking the best warriors entering the castle no problem and then fleeing from the dogs not portrayed so well i think â danys storyline is still pretty weak guess its supposed to show how she is struggling with her newfound power she is trying to rule in mereen but what about the other cities i actually thought that this short piece of her story were nicely done in all the last episodes she always was the shining queen idealistic liberator everything was so easily divided between poor slaves and evil master seemed you could just rush from city to city now shes realising that its not black and white and also that the day to day business of ruling is exhausting difficult and tiresome that only mereen was shown doesnt matter it is an example how it is one the one city so considering she has to rule more cities it means her task is even more difficult"

"SeA±or de la Tormenta",2014-05-11,"i like it specially stannis scene for a change the trial was done nicely however i wont give it the highest grade because the asharamsey scene sucked as hell im so tired of the almost reunion pointless scenes done many times with starks and now with greyjoys its a 7 for me"
"YourMomsBox",2014-05-11,"great episode made that way by the trial scene loved loved loved the acting by dinklage"
"Fez",2014-05-11,"910 â everything stannisdavos and kings landing was great really great the dany stuff was good the dreadfort was kinda meh"
"ohpooratlas",2014-05-11,"i gave it an 8 if only because the whole yara plot was utterly pointless â the trial was gold though emmy nom for this peter dinklage for the confession can we all agree yes"
"Kikiadiamond",2014-05-11,"dinklage rocked this episode"

"Jamie Lannister",2014-05-11,"810 mostly for the trial ashas little trip was a baffling waste of time but christ that trial even jaimes early role in it fit perfectly"
"lostinwesteros",2014-05-11,"tyrion and jaime were awesome â actually all the key players connected with the trial were â and shae  i cant wait for her to get hers â eta â i gave it a 10â edited by lostinwesteros 11 may 2014  0903 pm"
"FNF",2014-05-11,"9 my favourite of the season for sure the filler scene with asha was pretty pointless but was still better than crasters keep because it didnt drag on ramsay and reek scene was good and the rest was outstanding"
"Tyrion Hand of the King",2014-05-11,"the trial was flawless great episodeâ"
"Peachie",2014-05-11,"ashayaras side trip to try to rescue theon was a little pointless but theon  ramsey made up for it and brought the score back up to a nine for me even though i know what happens with the trial it was still fantastic"
"AryaSansa",2014-05-11,"i giive it a 6 was kind of boring â seeing stannis get a bank loanâ why would the bank give an evil religious maniac a loan â â watching dany doing meetings was boring too â yara attacking ramsay was kind of a let down too â i thought ironborn were stronger and they had shieldsâ ramsay was naked and had a few dogs â and why would tyrion demand a trial by combat hes going to loseâ shae was obviously under duress probably had to say those things or else shed die by cersei"
"Lord Godric",2014-05-11,"the first 10 ive given this year the trial was amazing the final scene where he demanded trial by combat gave me chills it was acted nicely and the produced wonderfullyâ"
"Colonel Green",2014-05-11,"braavosâ clearly setup for later but at least they clarified the size of stannis forcesâ plus salladaor saan gets his obligatory one scene per season thats such a weird recurring character â dreadfortâ single most pointless part of this season to date and im including the brothel scenesâ after the setup given to yara in the season 3 finale that was an incredible whimper â meereenâ eh okayâ amazing cgi on drogon â kings landingâ terrific stuff all around"
"C0bR",2014-05-11,"9 â i was about to give it 7 because of too much cringeworthy shae speaking but dinklage saved it â so my only complain is the lenght and the lame ironborndreadfort guys fight"
"makchamp",2014-05-11,"that ending thoughâ epic â was waiting for the trial episode since episode 2 it did not disappoint just sad that it ended in a huge cliffhangerâ"
"tito5601",2014-05-11,"cant give it a 10 cause the yara scene started of nicely but ended up being rlly bad when she escaped the stannis scene and the trial was amazing tho"
"Ran",2014-05-11,"best episode of the season so far gave it an 8 which i may decide to revise up to 9 later why not a 9 right off well the greyjoy business was not wellexecuted the reekspecific stuff yes but the stuff around it no in shades of the crasters keep matter plus emilia clarkes vacillating performance is indeed started to bug me the trial was exceptional though"
"ToTheWolves",2014-05-11,"i feel like the ashayara storming the dreadfort was sloppy and pointless i dont understand why they ran from two dogs and they were armed but everything else made up for it i especially liked the whole part with jamie and tywin"
"jarl the climber",2014-05-11,"i gave this one an eight the strongest episode of the season yararamsey was a little weak and cost the episode a point the trial was great stannis storyline was good hizadar came across as a sympathetic and interesting character which was a good change from the book where he seems to be a sleazeball good episode for clarke great episode for dinklage tyrion took a big risk asking for a combat trial without a champion lined up and calling joffrey a bastard strongly insinuated the rumors about cersei and jamie much ballsier than in the books where his actions were more measured"
"P. frontalis chiripepe",2014-05-11,"i feel like the ashayara storming the dreadfort was sloppy and pointless i dont understand why they ran from two dogs and they were armed but everything else made up for it i especially liked the whole part with jamie and tywin â i agree i think the asha sequence started out promising and then ended a bit clumsily not only did they run from the dogs but ramsey apparently gave them enough of a headstart to actually avoid getting caught by them which is uncharacteristic of him â â overall though i give the episode an 8 i liked the trial scenes â"
"Raksha 2014",2014-05-11,"9 a great episode almost as good as the blackwater in s2 â would have been a 10 without the burned goatchild confusion and ramsaygirlfriend porn and yara  her fearless five or whatever fleeing from a couple of dogs"
"rocksniffer",2014-05-11,"810 â at first i was leaning towards a lower score but the trial and the bit with ramsey washing reeks back made up for the pitiful effort to rescue himi mean how did they get awayafter i think he let the dogs out â but overall a good episode with killer moments during the trial and the addition of the tywinjamie moment â"
"Javi Marcos",2014-05-11,"the episode is almost perfect yaras plot was dumb i voted a 10 when in my heart is a 9 in order to compensate the usual hate"
"of man and wolf",2014-05-11,"those dogs are rather large id run from certain types of them as well even if armedâ â like kangals and suchthey can kill wolves wouldnt be much trouble killing humans â â anyways i dont think ramsay actually let the dogs out they just decided to leave and ramsay was content with the threat edited by of man and wolf 11 may 2014  0932 pm"

"Ser Blake",2014-05-11,"the trial was probably the best single scene in the entire seriesâ they freaking nailed itâ honestly i may have gotten more emotional and more chills at the trial than i did during the red weddingâ â peter dinklage just locked up his emmy"

"Gannicus",2014-05-11,"cogman nailed it â kings landing was perfect â aside from the dreadfort filler this was a fantastic episode the best episode of the season gets a 10"
"High-born Plumber",2014-05-11,"long may tyrion run"
"darksellsword",2014-05-11,"i gave it a solid 10 if you wont give a 10 for the trial scene alone then you are dead inside the dreadfort scene was a bit odd but only from a book readers point of view they are ironborn and he was their prince and he was shitting himself and out of his mind he wanted to be caged up with the dogsi think that was perfectly executed the ironborn despise what reek is no wonder yara said theon was dead i have to go with the emilia clarke critics tonight that scene with hizdar was cringe worthy to the extreme hopefully they can recover what she lost tonight with more vulnerabilty and emotion in her performances having said that i think the writing hit the right note the trial was fantastic peter dinklage was phenomenal i liked the small council discussing daenerys especially tywin complaining about how stupid joffrey was for dismissing ser barristani wonder will people be complaining about the white washing of tywin the only things that i didnt like at all were the varys and oberyn discussion and oberyns and did you fuck him like it was his last night on earth just thought it had no class overall i thought it was a great episode by far the best of the season so far it had a dragon burning things up and a lion tearing people apart"
"Scrambled Aegon",2014-05-11,"the incredibly elusive 910 â the only reason it doesnt get a 1010 is because it wasnt blackwater it was essentially a 1010"
"Honey Bee",2014-05-11,"i enjoyed this episode i feel that the episode had a nice flow to it viewers see the ties from the beginning of the season plans are coming to fruition ie stannisdavos i really enjoyed the iron bank scenes im sure it gave stannis more street cred from some of the unsullied viewers ramsey reek and yara scenes i also enjoyed i believe that to say it is pointless is a bit of an exaggeration i can agree ramsaynaked girl scene was silly but i enjoy the actor who plays ramsay so but they did convey reeks loyalty as well as his mental state i think its a good stepping stone to where the show plans to go in the next episodes obviously they cant leave us hanging on reeks story dannys scenes were great the throne is a bit more than she bargained for the dragon looked amazing the flow of the scene was nice i didnt know what was about to happen and then drogon came up out of now where tyrions trial was absolutely riveting i loved the acting it was spot on i was so emotional the ups and the downs i could go on i gave this episode a ten i was very satisfied with it"
"cybobbie",2014-05-11,"i had to give 10 just for the trial scene because the last minutes of it was simply awesome as many i didnt like ashas scene at the dreadfort but i have to say that when the trial started i totally forgot about it just retained the great scene of davos and the trial both made this episode one of the best"

"Stannisrex",2014-05-11,"initially gave it a 9 changed it to a 10 because ive come to realize the dreadfort scene was about theon not yara as far as establishing theons identity as reek that scene nailed it"

"FalseKnight",2014-05-11,"best episode of the season so far gave it an 8 which i may decide to revise up to 9 later why not a 9 right off well the greyjoy business was not wellexecuted the reekspecific stuff yes but the stuff around it no in shades of the crasters keep matter plus emilia clarkes vacillating performance is indeed started to bug me the trial was exceptional though all due respect ran i think they did the greyjoy plot because viewers dont have theons thoughts they didnt see how lost theon really is after yara said that her brother is dead my unsullied friends and family members jaws collectively hit the floor"

"Sages",2014-05-11,"some of my favorite quotes from people commenting on the show tonight â tyrion puts the imp in pimp â impin aint easy â the imp deserves an emmy an oscar and a grammy â that monologue from tyrion was the best thing they have ever said on the show seriously another emmy please â theres a lot of great acting in this show but wow peter dinklage stands taller lawl over everyone else hes just plain ol too good â peter dinklage continues to prove why hes one of if not the best things about this show hes just perfect in almost every scene he does â i only wished that the trial took the entire episode it was too short but i guess short but sweet â great great final 20 minutes tyrion completely owned this episode as we all knew he would but i didnt expect his acting to be that good i mean wow everything from his facial expressions body language voice intonation it was just great acting i wish he had more screen time with his monologue wonderful performance edited by sages 11 may 2014  1022 pm"

"DarkAndFullOfTurnips",2014-05-11,"gave it a 9 very close to 10 though brian cogman really should write every episode â i know people are complaining about the dreadfort stuff which honestly was kind of odd at the endescape but getting to see alfie allen as reek was amazing i suppose were supposed to believe asha has just realized her brother is ruined and is no longer theon which i think wouldve worked ok if they spent a bit more time on it i think cogman tried to write around that whole eventually pointless plot but it was kind of worth the anti climax just to see alfie be a perfect reek everything else was perfect davos selling of stannis was so fucking amazing the respect and love for davos from stannis came a bit later but its there now â ncw is so good at conveying emotion with just facial expressions and dinklage really did well such a great overall episode that its honestly made me rethink my previous votes because this is how the show should always be i cant wait to rewatch it edited by darkandfullofturnips 11 may 2014  1032 pm"

"Bluecore",2014-05-12,"410 â  yaras assault was just plain bad underwhelming hated how they turned ramsay into a badass fighterâ  iron bank of braavos was a disappointment despite a decent performance as usual from liam cunningham  the dialogue between daenerys and hizdahr zo loraq was some of the worst acting ive seen in the entire series  the constant reminders about oberyns sexuality were cringeworthy far worse than previous episodes its just getting embarrassing now â  the trial itself was okay nothing exceptional but not particularly disappointing sibel kekilli once again proved that shes not a good actress â overall one of the most disappointing episodes i can remember something about it just rubbed me the wrong way â i agree that theyre making an un necessarily huge deal out of oberyns sexuality reminds me of the bfd theyre making about the homosexual who was picked in the nfl draft however hbo has been doing this for a while im thinking of omar from the wire to startâ â the whole dreadfort scene up until the retreat was dumb she made this great speech and then we got 3 minutes of fighting and then they had to bounce ramsey had two small daggers and no armor on and him and a handful of his people took on the best reavers in the iron islands and made them retreat for gods sake they were fully equipped and even had shields theons acting was good though you could really get the impression he was a broken manâ â i was also under the impression that braavosis were more for lack of a better term foreign in the books the representatives for the iron bank reminded me of 21st century swiss bankers or something lol mildly disappointing but not a huge deal ive learned to accept the fact that charles dance has hairâ â the actor who played shae used to do porn wasnt expecting muchâ â i disagree about the trial i think it was done really wellâ"

"Corvinus",2014-05-12,"i gave it 8 maybe it deserves a 9 what i didnt like about the ashayara was the whole logistics of it every episode the intro shows us where storylines are taking place but they dont seem to care on how a character gets from a to b how did asha get from the iron islands to the dreadfort without anyone catching her still 1 for her using an axe and not a sword and we finally got to see some badass ironborn i also didnt like daenerys and hizdhar much the rest was great"

"Cyvasse Khal",2014-05-12,"810 for me a classic case of an episode building momentum as it goes along culminating in a great ending by midway through i was getting bummed because it was heading towards another soso episode but as soon as kings landing started things just picked up enormously and thats no coincidence the major players and the major acting talents were on full show here â positives the titan we already saw it in the trailers but that didnt make it any less impressive and a great scenic shot of braavos gives us a sneak peak before spending more time there next season drogon wow awesome meereenhizdahr first time this season i have included meereen in the positives i loved how it played out showed dany can make the easy decisions like repaying lost goats but flounders when it comes to dealing with more complicated matters the actor that played hizdahrapologies i dont know him was terrific his delivery of good written dialogue was very good small council every character got to have a little say here and all of it was important stuff acted brilliantly this episode made me realise i had missed seeing more of varys this season the trial perfect i loved every second of it once again every character was just highlighted everybody was seen to be important the exchanges between all the characters were fantastic tyrion special mention to peter dinklage time and time again he just proves when he needs to step up and knock a scene out of the park he does it his scathing address to the citizens of kl is definitely up there in my favourite moments â negatives iron bank for two reasons yet again stannis has been given pretty shoddy treatment here he cant persuade the ib but davos can just made him look weak and we are supposed to believe that the ibpretty much the most important institution in this world can just change their minds on a pretty damn important decision where they have already laid out their reasons for declining but switch based on a somewhat rousing speech from davos really not a fan of how all that played out filler time nudity come on hbo the sallador scene was pointless as was ramsays sex scenethat didnt even really feel like a ramsay thing to show storm of dreadfort rushed and sloppily done yaraasha dont think dd really know how to portray this character and that mostly comes down to not getting enough screen time for her to be fleshed out more her speech to the ironborn was good but that sort of contradicted the retreat and regroup decision she makes in the end edited by cyvasse khal 12 may 2014  0831 am"

"Tywin's bastard",2014-05-12,"a lot of great acting in this episode and it feels like its one of my favorites in the show altogether especially for not being a climax episode â it was almost as if those 8 minutes were scenes of yara at the dreadfort that they cut for whatever reason it seemed odd that ramsay just shows up with random blood all over himself and there was no real escape sequence â i dont think that scene needed anything more than it had i like that we dont have to be shown why ramsay has blood all over himself because we know hes crazy enough to kill the girl he was with and the point of the scene wasnt really anything about the ironborn but to show that theon is perhaps damaged beyond repair as not even his sister could snap him out of it"

"Onion Seaworth",2014-05-12,"i feel like the ashayara storming the dreadfort was sloppy and pointless i dont understand why they ran from two dogs and they were armed but everything else made up for it i especially liked the whole part with jamie and tywin simple tactics they focus on ramsay and the bastard boys the bitches would bite her leg off focus on the dogs and ramsay and his boys could rush in and stab poor yarasha and her ironborn through the heart although i had wished to see the chase from the dogs something simmilair to the previous ramsay chase or if he had caputured yarasha and do a hunt with her later â beasts are some of the best offensive one can have they are vicious and dangerous aswell expendable so to you who say she could have killed the bitches and ramsay along with his remains of the troops are wrong â on topic 10 i liked it all although the dreadfort attack was a bit too short and edited i loved to see ramsay fight laughing in his opponents faces why he simply wailed on them with his mace and dagger i have said i like show ramsay a bit more then book ramsay because of the sick twisted joker esque characteristics in the show although i still love book ramsay i only wish for them to tell more horrifying stories about him like in the books mereen although i am not a fan of dany was very good standing by her descision and such and ofcourse the trial i have no words it was perfect pure and simple â fav so far and 10 out of 10"

"Rockroi",2014-05-11,"the show begins its final rampup of the seasonâ definitely better than the last two episodes but â<U+0080> â what i liked â trials and tribulations the trial was incredible extraordinarily well done and the highlight of the episodeâ it took up about 20 minutes of the show so to have sych a longrun of extrodinary story is a very good thing â for those who know me from the board they know i am actually a trial attorney and so i watched the episode with a different eyeâ watching the farce of the trial and how it was inflicted on the accused and how that accused did not have the knowledge necessary to fight back reminds me â<U+0080><U+0093> just a little â<U+0080><U+0093> of being in court when people represent themselves under the false belief that well if they could just talk to the judge the judge â<U+0080><U+009C>would just know iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m innocentâ<U+0080><U+009D>â i hear that often and watching tyrion get beaten up is reminiscent of that reality â pretty much every aspect of the trial was well done and i enjoyed the buildâ â other notes from the trial â huge reveal that many of us already knew namely that tywin was never ever going to allow tyrion to die he was always going to send him to the wallâ but whatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s one last twist of the knife â tyrionâ<U+0080><U+0099>s reaction to shae was perfect especially how just like in the book he takes his venom out on those he saved and how much he regrets it mostly out of spiteâ â jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s maneuver to keep his brother alive once again shows us how much this man loves his brotherâ the things he does for loveâ i also liked his interplay with tywin and throwing at tywin his own worldviewâ after all who wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t kill a king for a lannisterâ â theon the pale while its clicha the showâ<U+0080><U+0099>s work on the theonreak transformation has been fantasticâ this episode finally included ashayaya and i thought that fear and rebellion against â<U+0080><U+009C>beforeâ<U+0080><U+009D> was executed flawlesslyâ watching theon frantically resist rescue made me believe that sort of thing was possibleâ â we saw a dragon no literally thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s what qualifies for a good thing now that we are kneedeep in post stormofswords gotâ â what i am on the fence about â name stannis baratheon age 42 occupation king of westerosâ credit score 666 but rising all things considered it was not a bad sceneâ the iron bank was as singleminded as i guess we all would hope responsible banks would beâ they laid out facts not emotion and stuck stannis where he lives his small army smaller holdings and 01 battle record since robert was slainâ and davosâ<U+0080><U+0099> impassioned response was â excellent well doneâ<U+0080> â  and i couldnt help but notice not delivered by stannisâ look i get it they donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t like stannis dd have ruined the character and made it so heâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll likely liberate the wall just as mance decides to take the black and dedicate himself to world peaceâ butâ<U+0080> would have killed dd to have â<U+0080> you knowâ<U+0080> stannis say something convincingâ have him say what he isâ maybe get him to â<U+0080> do somethingâ the annexation of all of stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099> wit stannis ultradry the loss of his realization growth and decency the removal of his leadership etc it knows no boundsâ now in scenes that were not even in the books stannis canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t be stannisâ now davos has to be stannisâ â ironborn no dogs allowed so you raid this castle and you fight the the death in a gutty dramatic battle complete with huge pep talk at the start you rush in and kill and die and make this huge incredible showing of determination and pride and bravery and courage and fucking ballsout heroismâ â  but fuck run they have dogs â really â did did that really happen â so dogs make the ironborn run â is that a thing now â really â â boredom okay i like how there is a tedium in being a dragon priestess and have to ruleâ ruling as robert told us â<U+0080><U+0093> can be very boringâ she conquered her territories she now has to rule it i also did like the audience with the man who just wanted to bury his horrifying slaveowning father who had plenty of chances to do the right thing but conveniently waited until there was an army of unsullied and three dragons up his ass before he filed his objection fatherâ but havingaâ scene showing how boring things are â<U+0080> tends to remind viewers just how â<U+0080> boring things areâ boredom does not always make for

in on the last big event of the books the battle of the wall soon the last major characters we actually watch will be gone or far worse thrown to the seven winds without rhyme or reasonâ as the story grows more and more fragmented not less and less it will be harder and harder to tell this storyâ as ffc takes up more space and bores us all to death as dany does less as we flicker from dorne to the iron isles to cersei being â<U+0080> being all â<U+0080> cersei â<U+0080> as these events take on less and less shapeâ<U+0080> â â<U+0080> the most popular show on paycable tv is headed for a huge

"Chloe.a.thomson",2014-05-14,"â ok that too but shirtlessness is so common and expected on got that i no longer even notice it â â its possible of course but why include something that would be so completely lost on show viewers who havent read the books he might have been thinking of cersei and jaime lysa and littlefinger even shae and tyrion showwise â i just thought the look on oberyns face hinted at that but i could be reaching every time oberyn is onscreen i am waiting for someone to mention elia â â â and although i have never thought about it i agree with those that think that varys is aware of sansas whereabouts and is keeping it quiet for now in show and books keeping her undetected in the vale means she can be of use to him in the future he just has to deal with lf however if she is captured and executed by the lannisters the north is lost to the boltons as far as varys is concerned assuming he doesnt know about bran and rickon"
"Daenor",2014-05-14,"varys has been using an extended network of spies indeedbut this doesnt mean that he knows everythinghow the hell the wretched kids of flea bottom that are part of his little birds where supposed to recognize arya for exampleor any other of his spies and informantsits not as if arya has some unique features that make her immediately recognizable and they cant exactly google her namecheck her facebook or instagram to get some pictures of her"

"The Prince of Newcastle",2014-05-14,"great episode theonramsey bath scene was utterly horrific great acting by both especially alfie allen the sexual undertones were really uncomfortable especially the way ramsey smiles at theons ken doll patch i never picked up on a sexual interest ramsey had in theon in the books but others did and it seems like d and d did as well tyrion was amazing the whole trial was brilliant oberyn owns every scene he is in im not so sure about mace tyrels portrayal he seems extremely incompetent and i never got that impression from the books hes an oaf a bit of a buffoon but hes not any bodies lap dog im not bothered so much though different canon i cannot wait to see the mountain"
"Lady Blue Rose",2014-05-14,"the weirdest bit was sansas necklace we saw littlefinger crush sansas necklace so how the hell did pycell get it or one that looked exactly like it in that rolling stone interview with grrm there was this â that killing happens early in this fourth season the books of course are well past the poisoning of king joffreyâ in the books â<U+0080><U+0093> andâ i make no promises because i have two more books to write and i may have more surprises to reveal â<U+0080><U+0093> the conclusion that the careful reader draws is that joffrey was killed by the queen of thorns using poison from sansas hairnet so that if anyone did think it was poison then sansa would be blamed for it sansa had certainly good reason for it â doesnt it sound like grrm is hinting theres more to joffreys poisoning than we suspect last week when cersei asked margaery if she still wanted to be queen i thought what the fuck wouldnt it be a real pisser if cersei was in on the poisoning its a crazy idea i know but tyrion says if theres one person im sure of that didnt kill joffrey its cersei thats just too good of a line to not be true oh the irony think about it cersei was losing control of joffrey and theres also this from the rolling stones interview â i dont know if somebody like jaime or cersei can be redeemed cerseis a great character â<U+0080><U+0093> shes like lady macbethâ well redeemed in whose eyes shell never be redeemed in the eyes of some shes a character whos very protective of her children you can argue wellâ does she genuinely love her childrenâ or does she just love them because theyre herâ children theres certainly a great level of narcissism in cersei â i would argue that cersei viewed joffrey as hers and when he wasnt hers anymore she wanted him dead â i dont know about cersei killing joffrey i think he was the only one of her children she genuinely loved unconditionally not that she doesnt love the others but she does so in a twisted way she was always tender and proud of him even if he was a monster but with tommen she is constantly disappointed â but i have always wondered whether she would have issues and try to fight in some way when tommen comes of age and tries to take power ive believed that is a possibility ever since that scene when tommen wants to make some sort of decision because he is the king and she punishes him her thoughts are that tommen can wait for his turn at ruling because after everything she had take from robert her father etc it was her turn now â it is disturbing that she would think she has earned this and it is her time given that it is tommen who is actually king she has no claim to the position except as his mother the dynamic of power between her and tommen is significantly different than it was with joffrey granted tommen is younger but still it make me think cersei may later have issues ceding power to tommen â<U+0080>once she gets out of the trialsâ"
"Maia",2014-05-14,"in the books and show berric dondarrion and crew knew she was alive and looking to go to riverrun before the red weddingâ because one of the bwb was a former stark guardsman harwin who knew her quite well iirc arya also revealed herself to him immediately thinking that she finally found somebody who was unreservedly on her side in affc brienne hears rumors that the hound was with a highborn girl whom she assumes is sansa when she is looking at the saltpans â rumors coming from the same source  the bwb who knew very well that sandor stole arya from them so yea the mere knews that sandor was travelling with some ragged girl wouldnt have had anybody thinking of arya they did some odd stuff in season 2 where it looked as if littlefinger recognized arya when visiting tywin in harrenhal but there was no followup on his part whatsoever so it seems like itwas just a quick way to ratchet tension a little if varys had known aryas whereabouts he would have grabbed her for future use or tried to edited by maia 14 may 2014  0910 am"
"Mithras",2014-05-14,"the tv show has its own canon but in the books there is a very interesting theory that cersei tried to poison tyrion with the pigeon pie but joffrey came and ate it so joffrey died before the tyrell plot was played"

"Lady Blue Rose",2014-05-14,"and i say there is no reason that varys would not get a full report and no reaons that varys would not speculate who the girl with the hound was â we can disagree thats cool â ps westeros is way bigger than latin america â grrm says its roughly the length of south america â i dont know if anyone already pointed this out but im sure you meant that westeros is smaller â latin american comprises all countries in the americas were roman languages derived from latin are principle it includes countries starting in north america and every country from central and south america start at mexico and move all the way down to brazil as well as most islands on the caribbean and some in the pacificâ â south america is comprised by those countries south of panama starting with colombia all the way to brazil it is a bit over 3 million km2 smaller than latin america â not saying this to give a geo lesson just so you get a better grasp of the actual size of westeros â"

"Ghost wind",2014-05-14,"best episode so far surely of the season and probably of the whole series i mean when tyrion demanded the trial by combat i saw it was 49 minutes already and i was like wow that went quickly â loved bravoos in the opening and the titan but i pictured bravoos more like foggy â then that yaradreadfort thing it took her long enough to get there didnt it and correct me if im wrong but is there sea near the dreafort from the credits i think not anyway good filler it gives some screen time to yara it pictures how badly changed theon is already which is good because we dont get his povs and it shows how mad ramsay is i mean going to battle without any shirt and with this cuts all over his chest my only doubt is was that the girl or the actual fight haha â i liked how daenerys was handling the audiences and all but my only complain was hizdahr i mean why is he asking for his father if you make him look like a nice guy who has nice feelings for his father then it will not have the same effect when she marries him in the books he seemed to me a total asshole who only cared for money and power in the episode he was almost begging for his poor father who had not done anything to be buried nonsenseâ also i think everyone saying how whitewashed dany was didnt have much excuse this episode they clearly showed how she had punished some innocent men and how she didnt liked it but anyway did it â liked very much the small council meeting oberyn makes up for littlefinger and mace is such a bootlickerâ â the whole trial was perfect i think we can see how well cersei has manipulated the witnesses so that every little thing tyrion had done was tergiversated also it was clear how wounded he was when varys confessed i admire your good intentions jaime but i think the little combat bit ruined your little plan oooh and the shae i mean the look in tyrions face when he saw her and then how everything she said was just a lie with some bit of truth and how tyrion just completely looses his head and starts shouting that was greatly done and of course the i demand trial by combatâ â so very very good episode enjoyed every bit"

"madprofessah",2014-05-14,"in the books there is so much chaos on the country side that  as george paints it and i dont remember them running into any high born so it is not surprising that arya goes unnoticed well actually  you know arya has only three chapters in feast and only 2 in dance i am not counting mercy yet those 5 chapters were my favorites in novels 4 and 5 they are not short but i was intrigued every moment everything seemed off center and arya was growing and changing the show could do well with aryas braavos stuff â hear hear for me as well by far the best parts of book 4 and book 5 were the sob few arya chapters especially as danys went rapidly downhill and tyrions meandered â as for the episode itself i agree with everyone who said that the dreadfort scene was ridiculous ramsay is in a swordfightâ shirtless and doesnt get a scratch on him he has scratches from the rough sex with myranda beforehand methinks ridonculously bad then it just turns into farce when the iron born run away from dogs sheesh â but peter dinklage tore up the scenery in the trial scene im still rooting for charles dance to get an emmy i dont think he has had a bad scene in the show ever the look on jaimes face when tywin says quickly done is priceless â"

"Emperoreddy",2014-05-12,"â â it comes close if not his best one â what was most amazing was watching the selfcontrol that tyrion has probably cultivated most of his life break and all his builtup bitterness over years of mockery from the world and scorn from his father because of a condition tyrion could not help and would do anything to change come raging out of him like a lions roar â and the tyrion eye challenge to tywin at the end  naked hate and a hint of pain from tyrion and fury and some surprise from tywin â god that eye challenge was great that little smirk he gives at then end of it even better that it seems tywin is doubly mad if his plan was never to actually execute tyrion now he knows he will die and that jamie may volunteer and he could lose him which is even worse i honestly cant get enough of this scene dinklage is just so good dance doesnt have to do much heavy lifting but he is always goodâ â pw was excellent but this episode blows everything out of the water edited by emperoreddy 12 may 2014  0222 am"

"Pod The Impaler",2014-05-12,"another thing that bugs me about shae selling out sansa at length is that not only did the show make a big deal out of shaes love for sansa but while she was clearly souring on tyrion and feeling increasingly resentful towards him she not once showed anything but affection for sansa after the marriage and never seemed to direct her anger about the marriage towards her she was clearly concerned in 4x01 that sansa was not eating so its a big mystery that the show just had shae sell out sansa with no other apparent motiveagain absent coercionthan jealousy since shed never taken out her jealousy on sansa before â â i see shaes motivations as one of spite after tyrion broke her heart to save her life but she didnt understand that â thats a big difference from the books of course but it was really telegraphed in the show by the emotional direction the whole tyrionshae relationship had been given to begin with â of course there is still room for some ambiguity there too  a few things that might add up to a rather big surpriseâ â in any case nice trial for the most part tyrion  gets no witnesses almost no questions ah medieval justice â the tradeof jaime made is something that made sense  since kevan lannister is not in this and jaime was back so damn early also jaime sort of knew shae was coming next on the witness list didnt he no outbursts lol not happening â tyrions tirade in the court  i think they mostly got it right dear kings landing fuck you all i hope someone invents nukes just so one can be dropped on this place signed tyrion the imp the twisted monkey demon"

"Charles Phipps",2014-05-12,"i think the sansa jealousy business was a ridiculous change but i think the other changes to shae were good ones part of what george rr martin does well is highlight what censored the whole medieval values system is shae is a prostitute but shes a human being first and bringing up this doesnt make her anything more or less than a person plying her trade is a good thing â yes in the books its tyrion who makes up the relationship in his head but showing he wanted to buy a girlfriend isnt a bad thing for me"

"Newstar",2014-05-13,"interesting to note wicnet on tumblr just posted an interview with the actress who plays shae she talks about wanting to take out the sansa line in her testimony she says she argued with dd to take it out because it was inconsistent with what she felt were genuine feeling of care for sansa by shae and also with her character having just said that shed kill for that girl interesting that they left it in not only because of her protestbut also because not even in the books did they go all out in placing the blame on sansa too i wonder if theres a future purpose to doing this or if its simply because they can â i agree with sibel kekilli that it made no sense for tv shae as shed been written to go scorched earth on sansa as well if there had been any hint at all in season 4 that she personally resented sansa and was turning against her it would be one thing but the last we saw of their relationship was shae urging tyrion that sansa needed to eat which certainly seemed consistent with the sisterly concern and love shed shown her previously the writers could have set it up incredibly easily as late as 4x01shae rolling her eyes at sansa crying over her family acting aloof or even contemptuous with sansa etc etcbut they didnt which makes shae turning on sansa just as she did on tyrion much less believable â to be fair to the writers though i get why they wanted shaes condemnation of sansa and tyrion to be consistent with the story the trial was selling of tyrion and sansa conspiring together to murder joffrey it wouldnt have worked if shae had been contradicting the other witnesses version of events which leaned so heavily on sansas involvement tyrion and sansa needed to be in on it together for the story as it was constructed to hold upwhere sansa was the drug mule tyrion procured the poison for sansa to use and tyrion was motivated in part by his sympathy for his wife and the northern causeand it wouldnt do for shae to insert her two cents about how there was no way sansa could have been involved despite all the other witnesses claims to the contrary and to float her own theory that tyrion had somehow acted entirely on his own even though sansa had worn the murder weapon edited by newstar 13 may 2014  0113 am"
"Mad Monkey",2014-05-13,"i think the problem is that they wanted shaes testimony to tie together all of the disparate pieces of evidence her testimony was basically closing arguments for the prosecution presenting a grand unified theory that covers the motive the means and opportunity for the crime if shae cared for sansa she could have just left out sansas involvement entirely it was already hinted by the other witnesses she could have just focused her testimony on establishing tyrions motive but the person pulling her strings  cersei  wanted to drive home the theory that tyrion and sansa planned and carried out the assassination together â amusingly it kind of highlights how stupid the prosecutions theory is cersei lf olenna et al have emphasized over and over how simple and dull sansa is compared to the conspirators in kings landing were all liars here and all of them better than you but in shaes cerseis version sansa is the brilliant master manipulator who used tyrion and dontos as pawns this girl  who has to be what 13 14  managed to seduce tyrion into killing joffrey to avenge her brother mother and father then left him holding the poisoned chalice to take the fall then she and dontos disappeared off somewhere where she managed to overpower a much bigger man  a former knight  filled him with crossbow bolts and dumped his body into the bay where he was found â why would tyrion agree to this plan if his motive is as shaecersei claim sex with sansa why would he agree to a plan that involves him poisoning the king in front of half the court a plan that guarantees his arrest and execution he must have been the one to arrange for dontos to take sansa away but why didnt he set it up so that he could go with them â before shaes testimony the case against tyrion almost held together it was obvious horse shit but as long as you look at each piece in isolation it worked tyrion did have the poisons that were used to kill joffrey he did threaten and insult joffrey and his mother on several occasions but when you put them all together it highlights how the whole thing makes absolutely zero sense"

"Hangover of the Morning",2014-05-13,"just because some people prefer subtle acting doesnt mean that acting over the top is bad â in that situation it was perfectly appropriate for petertyrion to act over the top i wouldve gone crazy on those people too and probably would have said f you to them individually cartman style  â i prefer subtle acting and generally find overacting really irksome but it was perfect for this scene it went from subtle to outburst to tyrion being in control besides he was addressing lots of people who were far from him so he needed to be loud and theatrical to get his point throughâ"
"Envie",2014-05-13,"â also for all his advicegiving tyrion has never been one to follow it his mouth has always been getting him into trouble even he acknowledges this well in the books anyhow and jaime knew it too  you dont say no outbursts to someone who would never have an outburst â but yeah if ever he was going to blow up this was the time for it well in a way he is wearing the monster as armour â exactly he went from wearing his carefully concealed dont care dwarf armor to wearing a new set of armor  monster armor and thats the armor hell be wearing going forward as part of his own transformation part of what i love about jaime and tyrion is the brothers parallel between how vastly different their lives become from the beginning of the saga as they both grow and learn more about themselves and frankly become better men because of it this theme is common in the book for many characters but for tyrion its very much heartbreaking yet inspirational because hes such a survivor that even after everything else has been taken from him and hes killed his lover and father and escaped into the night like a common criminal he still holds onto his will to live he doesnt want to eat those poisonous mushrooms he found in illyrios garden in adwd for exampleâ â tyrion had very little hope of ever being more than the useless second son and dwarf in his fathers eyes now freed of that restraint he can finally find himself a new life despite trying to drink himself to death in pentos â â â this all the way ive seen people going really mad and its not subtle or dignified it is truly scary and in many ways heartrending to behold cause all control or sense goes out the window â thats sorta what real madness looks like theres really no other way for dinklage to play this up â in second sons he was angry with joffrey yes but this is much worse its not just his asshole nephew disrespecting him and threatening his wife frustrating situation yes but you can recover its all of the people he saved treating him with more venom than they ever did stannis wanting his head and his family ruining his life the wall would be almost as bad as death for tyrion there is no going back from this nobody was standing up for him save for jaime who was powerless and he was truly alone in the world that is not just anger or frustration that is bottomless despair a lifetime of hatred and unrelenting betrayal â excellent points especially comparing how carefully controlled he was with the joffrey scene yes he was angry yes he did a stupid thing to outburst and threaten joffrey because of sansa but he did all that without losing his full composure if thats what people expected him to do in the trial scene then they really dont get the immense shock and betrayal hes just experienced at the hands of shae along with his entire family except jaime turning on him and wanting him dead right there in front of the entire court it was tragic and he fully portrayed a person coming unglued and screaming out in a rage at his audience perfectlyâ â remember at this point he has nothing else to lose he even says he would rather lose his life than put up with the injustice and lies that are being put forward for show and that he truly wished he had poisoned joffrey its one of those situations where you can understand that if a persons going to be humiliated and sentenced to die they wish theyd actually made it worth it â i hope people who are criticizing peters acting performance actually stop and try to put themselves in tyrions shoes for a moment  just try to think what it must be like and how you might pop your cork in that very moment after shae did that to him and cersei is sitting over there smirking viciously at him the whole time and your father is the judge whos going to sentence you  would you keep your cool maybe some of you would  but tyrion lost his and i think peter portrayed it very well"

"Khal Porno",2014-05-13,"after todays episode i think shae has genuine feelings for tyrion when he adresses her for the first time you can hear how her voice falter before continuing her speech also just after tyrion demands a battle trial you see how she looks very surprised and franctic eyes flitting back and forth clearly this is something she did not expect nor wished for my hypothesis is that shae was not coerced into doing what she did in that sense that her life was threatened i rather think she was offered a deal by tywin in much the same way jamie was  you tell on him make him look bad  guilty and i make sure he survives and send him to the wall this would also be more fitting of the personality we have seen in shae so far ie she knew she was living a risky life with tyrion and agreed to it anyway i can see her resigning herself to being killed in other words shae is trying to protect tyrion by doing what tywin asked of her so that he will be send to the wall rather than killed i think that tywin did not expect tyrion to be that deeply in love with shae he wanted tyrion to be pushed but not that far yes i think that is exactly the case and its odd that so many people here have overlooked these clues most likely blinded by their hatred of the show version of shae and tyrion"

"Khal Porno",2014-05-13,"â i agree with sibel kekilli that it made no sense for tv shae as shed been written to go scorched earth on sansa as well if there had been any hint at all in season 4 that she personally resented sansa and was turning against her it would be one thing but the last we saw of their relationship was shae urging tyrion that sansa needed to eat which certainly seemed consistent with the sisterly concern and love shed shown her previously the writers could have set it up incredibly easily as late as 4x01shae rolling her eyes at sansa crying over her family acting aloof or even contemptuous with sansa etc etcbut they didnt which makes shae turning on sansa just as she did on tyrion much less believable â to be fair to the writers though i get why they wanted shaes condemnation of sansa and tyrion to be consistent with the story the trial was selling of tyrion and sansa conspiring together to murder joffrey it wouldnt have worked if shae had been contradicting the other witnesses version of events which leaned so heavily on sansas involvement tyrion and sansa needed to be in on it together for the story as it was constructed to hold upwhere sansa was the drug mule tyrion procured the poison for sansa to use and tyrion was motivated in part by his sympathy for his wife and the northern causeand it wouldnt do for shae to insert her two cents about how there was no way sansa could have been involved despite all the other witnesses claims to the contrary and to float her own theory that tyrion had somehow acted entirely on his own even though sansa had worn the murder weapon it does make sense because if she was compelled to testify and implicating sansa was part of whatever deal she struck then she would implicate sansa as wellâ â most likely she would have objected to that but tywin wouldnt let her get out of itâ unfortunately we will never know because those conversations happened offscreen â edit sorry for the triple post thats the problem with coming late to these huge multipage threads edited by khal porno 13 may 2014  0910 pm"

"avernite",2014-05-18,"maybe you cant stand it but the whole world has a massive issue with rape culture so what if a female can be a triarch or even a queen the point is that even women with free agency are constantly overlooked ridiculed and threatened just a few examples cersei queen regent of the seven kingdoms her thoughts and ideas although theyre usually terrible are constantly dismissed and undermined by the men around her in small council especially by her own father she gets people to do her bidding by sexually manipulating them and has nothing else to offer even with the privilege the wealth of casterly rock can provide her brother is a dwarf and constantly ridiculed yet has held two actual positions of note master of coin and hand of the king without having to sleep around to get them arianna older than her brother quentyn and actually ahead of him in the line of succession overlooked by her father who wants her younger brother to rule dorne and has wanted so since she was a child also uses her sexuality to get what she wants out of the men around her when she is proactive and plans to take power she is undermined by her own friends and father the sand snakes some of the most highlyeducated and free women in the world they are imprisoned by their uncle for wanting to avenge their fathers death including the girls who are too little to do anything to actually organise said revenge brienne as skilled with a blade as any man is tormented by men and has had many near misses with rape mentions having to basically sleep with one eye open at all times because of rapists dany actually takes cities by force the way male conquerors of the past have but the only way she felt able to stop the killing of her people was by giving herself over in marriage she was not loved or respected enough or powerful enough to work out a solution to the problem on her own even though she was advised not to marry women in that world are constantly thwarted threatened hurt and used thats just how it is i personally cannot take gender out of the equation when i look at the issue of equality in asoiaf its not the most important issue or the biggest but its still very much there as a woman i would not want to live anywhere in that world those are just my feelings on the matter westeros isnt a society built upon rape per se imo but its an extremely patriarchal society where men and women are not equal even when a woman is a ruler with power and rape is fact of life there all most women have to offer is their bodies no matter how high born they are which is always true in aggressively patriarchal societies whenever women are seen as not having agency over their lives or bodies rape abounds â cersei she it should be noted fails miserably prior to all the problems you explain she is seen as bad for having failed to stop joffrey from killing eddard  implying she could do so as a woman to a king shes his mother granted but it clearly shows shes seen as having agency she just fails at it which is what all subsequent events keep showing that in addition she uses sex as a weapon proves what that she has control over her sexuality and she can give or deny it to people and gain power that way how is that not control â arianne well yeah you obviously didnt read the books all the way  she was supposed to get the higher honour than her brother also same as above shes the one using her sexuality as a control tool and in her case its even clear the man is the one who shouldnt be allowed to do what he does and would be punished for it not her â the sand snakes these women are treated as a clear threat to the position of a man the prince of dorne threatened by women bastardborn women even he wins the struggle but he clearly thinks theres an actual contest if he doesnt act how does this show them as powerless rather than as serious players that need to be countered â brienne i cant argue with that one but then she kills people too not sure if thats so great â dany the way aegon the bloody conqueror took the seven kingdoms and made his peace was by not changing anything just adding a loose layer on top of the pyramid of power dany does something completely different and has to solve it completely differently how does that prove anything â people in this world are constantly threatened hurt and used as a man i wouldnt want to live in the horrid world that is asoiaf either  maybe you get handed a stick and forced to fight another lord rather than get raped neither seems appealing really women have power as cersei shows as arianne shows as dany shows they have enough control over their bodies to choose where and when to have sex  and to use it to their advantage too cersei is threatened with a new forced marriage aye and sansa is forced to marry outright  but tyrion didnt have much of a choice in who he wanted to marry either meaning tysha here"

"Mrs_Darcy",2014-05-12,"i was really surprised when i saw the episode that they had not changed shaes testimony and her reasons for doing it  since they had made her a lot nicer than in the books i think it will be very hard for showviewers only to accept that showshae who genuinely loved tyrion and who stayed even when offered a good amount of gold for leaving him and going to essos basically sold tyrion out â i saw the hbo videos accompanying this episode inside the episode etc  and they made it clear that shae had been somehow coerced into it by cersei but why did we never see this it would have cost 2 minutes maximum in either this episode on in the last to have a scene in which cersei threatens shae with torture etc if she does not tell lies about tyrion in the trial â likewise i found it really odd that showshae was willing to implicate sansa in the murder of joffrey since she was quite fond of her in the show and even tried to hide the fact that she had flowered  in the books was quite greedy and i therefore was not surprised when she spoke against her especially as we later hear that cersei had promised her a manse additionally i found it quite odd that shae gave her testimony wearing one of sansas dresses since it made her look greedy which is in contrast to the shae hbo had portrayed before â a lot of bookreaders have speculated that shae would somehow implicate tyrion because she tries to save sansa which is also what i had assumed would happen â what do you think about this choice in the adaption"

"Bear Island",2014-05-14,"im still not convinced tyrion will kill them both show tyrion is so so whitewashed and beloved by the unsullied for him to kill both of them after being such a pure force of good not sure they can really do that i hope they do it because tyrion is one of the most complex grey characters in the books and is in no way a pure good guy i can see him accidentally killing one of them or shae being killed by someone else i could see him accidentally killing tywin in the heat of the moment or by accidentally discharging the crossbow likewise i could see him grappling with shae out of anger and her falling down the stairs or something he kills her in such a cruel and intense way in the books and show tyrion as broken as he is just doesnt seem to have that kind of cruelty in him the way the book version does edited by bear island 14 may 2014  0529 am"

"BurningCandle",2014-05-15,"im glad they made shaes motivation more than simple greed here it seems alot more understandable and tragic she has no idea that he really loves her she thinks it was all a sham and shes out to avenge herself and do some ladder climbing because of what she views as the ultimate betrayal of her by tyrion"
"Cubarey",2014-05-15,"tyrion was going to die shae would already of had her revenge and if she is bonking tywin on the night before tyrions execution then the writers of the show have not only made shae a maniac but a total sociopath aswell â shae was happy being with tyrion because he was a lannister a rich powerful noble what better sugar daddy can you have then tywin not only the hand of the king but the real power behind the throne shae was a mercenary whore all along in both books and tv she betrays tyrian not only because she was told to by cersitywin and to skewer tyrian but also to advance in favor with tywin which she obviously did as she ended up in his bed she deserved to be strangled by tyrian she betrayed him for fun and profit and deserved no other fate then what she got"
"igrewupinKL",2014-05-15,"â good if shae is stupid for not seeing through tyrions lies in 4x02 then tyrion is stupid for not seeing through shaes lies in 4x06 ive read an overwhelming amount of comments that just go along with whatever tyrion does and its really annoying â i never believed in the whitewash concept but his flawed moments like being insecure and not even able to look at shae when he breaks up with her seem to get overlooked because hes awesome most of the time â a lot is riding on this finale i can see people cheering when tyrion kills shae im reminded of the walking dead and people were happy with deaths just because characters were annoying i dont think thats good writing you should only kinda cheer at villain deaths like joffrey or ramsay â im not sure what youre trying to sayâ â what im saying is in the book tyrions speech at the end of the trial made sense because he knew shae was just after his gold and she didnt care about him or sansa â it doesnt make sense in the show when theyve constantly given proof that shae does in fact care and love tyrion and sansa yes shae is stupid for not seeing that tyrion was just trying to protect her thats in line with her book character but not her show character in season 2 she was sharp and now this season she is dumb and annoying it doesnt make any sense so in the show for tyrion not to see that shae was doing exactly what he did to her in 4x02 does undermine his character because above everything tyrion is smarter than that forget whitewashing its not about that tyrion will still kill shae with the necklace he gave her in season 3 its just the reasons for it are a little less defined because i dont think shae deserves to die for what she did in the show but i guess we are yet to see what shell say to tyrion in the tower of the hand â i think they just stuffed up there was no avoiding tyrions trial speechso they had to make it look like shae betrayed him to me it looked like shae was made to say the story cersei invented and then tried to distance herself from tyrion by making him think she wanted to say those things you can see the worried look on shaes face when tyrion demands a trial by combat because she thought by making her testimony tyrion would be sent to the wall and live now theres a chance he will die"
"Seneti",2014-05-15,"secondly tysha now again remember we only know so much about tysha as readers because she plays a far bigger part in book tyrions thoughts but our unsullied friends only actually know her name from one episode in season 1 and a few offhand refereances refering to her cant remember myself if they actually say her name after season 1 show tyrion has never actually spoke about her in any more detail since now i asked my brother unsullied the other day do you remember what happened to tyrions first wife he said what happened to her i then said you dont remember her name by any chance i have seemed to forgot it he was pretty convinced they never actually said her namenow my brother is by no means a stupid guy i love my brother to bits and whats more i forgive him because how in the hell is any unsullied suppose to remember a name given to them in season 1 who has played no huge part in tyrions charecter since and next season all he going to go on about is tysha â i am probably going to get crucified by the agencyfundamentalists for saying this but even in the books tyshas name is of no importance what is important is that we remember what happened to her attentive viewers will remember tyrions conversation with bronn and shae as well as his fathers spiteful comment on his first marriage they might not remember the name but they remember the story and those who dont will most likely get a recap of that first conversation before ep 10 when tyrions wife will be reintroduced just when she becomes relevant to his character arc and the plot read through that last conversation between jaime and tyrion â so no i dont think shae will become tyrions tysha or be merged with her they still have good opportunities to remind viewers of what they need to know â ok just gotta come out of the closet and say itâ â â bookshae and showshae are ladder climbersâ this woman wants to go as high as she can and wont let anything stop her including love as if she could understand what that is â many who climb fail and never get to try again the fall breaks them  the climb is all there is"

"kacunnin",2014-05-16,"quote is the button in the bottom right under the message you want to quote â in my own opinion she is probably testifying because of all three but my real point is the nature of her testimony the fine details of their intimate conversations if she were testifying completely under duress there would be no need for her to reveal these things or she could have just made them up rather than repeating things that he had said to her word for word theres no getting away from the fact that she intentionally set out to humiliate him whether under duress or not she could not have been compelled to do it in that way that was her choice â im also not making the case that her murder would be justified by her wanting vengeance on tyrion only that vengeance is the primary motivation for her actions in my humble opinion i dont think perjury or vengeance on a former lover to be offenses worthy of a death sentence call me a liberal for that if you will but justice and death dont go hand in hand in westeros i think tyrion will get his revenge in what is the only socially acceptable way for a man to get vengence in the world of ice and fire that is by killing those who have wounded you as theres no chain of the hand but there is a pini could see a bit of stabby stabby on the way for poor old shae â edit an example of things she didnt have to reveal is the i am yours and you are mine possibly the most intimate and loving thing they said to each other this wounds tyrion deeply as she knew it would it prompts him to beg shae to stop at which she takes a deep breath and presses on this is clearly vengence for her from her perspective tyrion has betrayed their love and made her feel like a whore as if she is worthless so she is acting in a way that he has told her to as a mercenary who can be bought the consequences of this will of course be his death which makes her vengance slightly on the extreme side â hey thanks for the tip on how to quote  and its so simple â i do see your point and i know that most book readers will agree with youâ as i said in my first post i came to the books after the first three seasons of the show so my perspective is differentâ i got to know tyrion and shae as real lovers which is how they have been portrayed in the show from the startâ in the books its pretty clear shes a golddigging whore who uses tyrion for all she canâ â yes shes vengeful in her testimony and she does tell them intimate things he told herâ she is angry and she lashes out to hurt him  and she wants him to know that shes doing this to hurt him when he askes her to please stop she glares at him and says im a whore rememberâ â thats exactly what he said to her when he dumped her  he told her shes a whore and he cant have children or a life with a whoreâ â the problem i have with the scenario is that the show made tyrion the first betrayer  even if he did it for a socalled good reason to protect her he cruelly hurt her and in a way that would be very hard for her to forgetâ so when she hurts him back its a bit difficult for me to accept that hes angry enough to kill her â i also dont believe that tywin had sex with shaeâ i know thats whats suggested when tyrion finds shae in tywins bed in the book anyway but it totally goes against tyrins character for him to have a whore in his room much less a whore that has been sleeping with tyrionâ i see cerseis hand in this and varyss â finally the fact that the show left out the part where shae has sex with tyrion among the dragon bones seems importantâ that was a kind of betrayal that didnt seem coerced in the books  she acted as though she really loved him saying all the usual things to him my lion my giant of lannister and suggesting they would still be togetherâ but it was all liesâ and then she testifies against himâ â youre probably right and he probably will kill herâ but he shouldnt kill herâ its wrong to kill her even in westerosâ"

"Knight of Ashes",2014-05-14,"made up immensely for the rest of the ep but not the season so far all the lannisters were riveting to watch right from jaime closing his eyes as tyrion demanded trial by combat to the selfsatisfied look on cerseis face and the glaring contest between tywin and tyrion i also wouldnt mind margaery stating her true thoughts about the trial at some point one thing though as with the book i have a hard time believing that kingslanders werent happy that joffreys dead and at least some of them werent proclaiming tyrion a hero i know that may be dangerous but that are always some foolhardy enough to risk such things and while it made for a great dramatic moment particularly on tv ive always thought martin overstated how reprehensible the people of kings landing are and how far they were willing to blame tyrion for their troubles edited by knight of ashes 14 may 2014  0119 am"
"Woman of War",2014-05-14,"there was another heartbreaking and plot shaping lookintoeachotherseyes scene when jaime asked so very kindly and seriously do you trust me and tyrion looked up to him and full of trust and confindence said yes this was heartbreaking loving the little brother to the older one counting on him to chase the bullies away and the next moment tyrions look to tywin full of suspicion edited by woman of war 14 may 2014  0118 am"
"Envie",2014-05-14,"one thing though as with the book i have a hard time believing that kingslanders werent happy that joffreys dead and at least some of them werent proclaiming tyrion a hero i know that may be dangerous but that are always some foolhardy enough to risk such things and while it made for a great dramatic moment particularly on tv ive always thought martin overstated how reprehensible the people of kings landing are and how far they were willing to blame tyrion for their troubles â you have to remember those in the throne room for this mock trial were all nobles or related to the court  castle in some way and so they absolutely must be bought in 100 even if fake to the lannisters and that means to tywin as the defacto ruler and cersei as the dowager queen speaking out against them would be treasonous and so of course they are all too willing to blame tyrion these are the same idiots who were at the wedding enjoying the crowns coin in wine and food while watching joffrey be a total ass just before he died they witnessed the whole thing and stood around like the sheep that they are despicable but not a one of them has any power to speak out against the true evilâ â i imagine among the smallfolk theres a bit more appreciation for tyrion and a lot more hatred for joffrey  they did riot and throw shit at him in the streets rememberâ â its the toadies of court who are bought and paid for which isnt an uncommon theme in many historical royal courts"
"Tears of Lys",2014-05-14,"i thought it was a great scene and wonderfully wellplayed as stated many times upthreadthe one thing i didnt quite take from the books which was made abundantly clear here was how tywin was using the threat of tyrions execution against jaime to put jaime in the position of having to come to him and beg for his brothers life exactly what tywin wanted when you think about it it allowed tywin to set the conditions which of course were that jaime quit the kingsguard and take his rightful place at casterly rock and away from cerseidoes anyone else remember this point being made in the books edited by tears of lys 14 may 2014  1046 am"

"Mad Monkey",2014-05-14,"no one will sympathize with tyrion in open court in the books there was one man who praises tyrion during his testimony and it was ignored in fact cersei uses that to damn tyrion further saying that even someone who admires tyrion personally is giving evidence of his guilt"

"Theda Baratheon",2014-05-14,"i thought it was a great scene and wonderfully wellplayed as stated many times upthread the one thing i didnt quite take from the books which was made abundantly clear here was how tywin was using the threat of tyrions execution against jaime to put jaime in the position of having to come to him and beg for his brothers life exactly what tywin wanted when you think about it it allowed tywin to set the conditions which of course were that jaime quit the kingsguard and take his rightful place at casterly rock and away from cersei does anyone else remember this point being made in the booksits not in the books its an addition but i think it works well with tywins character"
"Knight of Ashes",2014-05-14," envie cant paste quotes for some reason â yeah i accept what you said about the people at court but i could do with at least a whiff of people acknowledging what tyrion did at the blackwater im sure there where surviving knights and soldiers who saw what he did and at least a tale of this would have got out like how many times does a dwarf lead a sortie â that you and i have to imagine a bit of appreciation from the smallfolk supports what im saying i think"

"Bear Island",2014-05-15,"i felt like peter went a bit ott with the snarling during the trial but not so over the top that it detracted from the scene which was quite excellent i think that the addition of the deal between jaime and tywin was perfect as an added bonus it fit well with my headcanon that tywin knows on some level that tyrion is too smart to be behind the murder but its just too good of an opportunity to stop tyrion from ever being the lord of casterly rock to pass up and thus tywin smothers his doubts and goes ahead with it"
"mankytoes",2014-05-17,"i thought it was great not just because of dinklage but all the different characters kings landing scenes are always great because theres so much character interaction margaery who usually looks calm and in control looked really uncomfortable knowing tyrion is innocent pycelles testimony was great as well i love the vindictive old bastard"
"Ser Desmond Wine's Bane",2014-05-17,"loved the scene â my only gripe is that loras was asleep and only woke up at the end when the court was in uproar"

"Matthew Marzolf",2014-05-21,"i think an important point this episode makes is that when they lift the dialog from the book its pure gold and when they think they know better than grrm theyre kidding themselves"
"MegaTechPC",2014-05-21,"peters work in this episode is some of the finest acting ever done on the small screen in my opinion â i also really loved charles dances scene in season one when he is talking to nikolaj while cleaning an actual deer â that is some mighty fine acting right there and its all of the incredible acting talent that truly make this show the best on television"
"MegaTechPC",2014-05-21,"i almost forgot there is one performer that i have never liked and continue to dislike in this episode â shae â i cant stand that actress and what she did to the shae role â not sure if its her or how the writers wrote her but she is just totally different than in the book and not in a good way in my opinion"
"Frey Pies",2014-05-12,"does anyone else think she was very good this episode i thought did a great job when talking to the goat herder and the more sympathetic tone she gradually took on when talking to hizdahr after being loathsome initially was great"
"Nymeria Stone",2014-05-12,"yes i agree i liked how dany looked very troubled and sad by what hizdhar and the goat herder said but she still tried to keep her serious queen face on emilias performance has been improving more and more she did great on season 3 and this season seems even more promising she and kit are really showing what they can do"
"Dragon Queen",2014-05-12,"i liked how young she looked when she smiled at the goat guy and told him hed get 3x the value of the goats she seemed like a younger girl and its a nice reminder that shes not quite all grown up even if she is queen her valyrian dialogue also tends toâ up her attractiveness and acting quality too"
"GSF_Grrrl",2014-05-12,"she was flawless thumbs up"
"Florina Laufeyson",2014-05-12,"she was alright yeah her wooden delivery to hizdahr was cool cuz it showed she was feeling some selfdoubt about the situation that and showing how dany cant just proclaim things with this lot her petulance was nice when speaking to hizdahr and it shows how arrogant dany had been and how hizdahrs words sorta brought her back to reality her how many more at missandei and missandei responds with a huge number and her face is like seriously missandeis annoyed tone of yes your grace was really awesome too seems like the mgal is like ok you bought this pig you arent gonna bother feeding it"
"LordStoneheart",2014-05-12,"the falseness people have been complaining about seems to be fading here with the goatherd she was wearing her queen armor so to speak but it started to break when hizdahr gave his tearjerking performance i thought she was amazingâ"
"Cyril",2014-05-12,"better than last episode surelyâ though she completely and utterly overdid the annoyance in both her face and voice in the one line where she makes hizdahr speak for himselfâ it was almost comical edited by cyril 12 may 2014  0837 pm"

"Hodor's Dragon",2014-05-12,"shes a very talented actress but she has been saddled this season with the brunt of a poor decision by the shows producersdirectors to take the brief amount of dany time available necessarily brief because nothing really happens with her story and heavily emphasize regal conqueror â book dany can do regal and conqueror but she can also be overcome by her emotions she questions her own decisions incessantly and basically only has selfconfidence when she absolutely must have it another key to her character she always steps up in the clutch â that whole thread about her last week was absurd in my opinion â she had about 30 seconds of screentime including these melodramatic scripted turns back and forth and direction to speak in a haughty regal tone  and really it had to have been direction if they didnt want haughty and regal they couldve said so â how are you gonna take that kind of dreck and make it sing â this week they finally interjected a little of that selfuncertainty that the character in the book thrives on and clarke nailed it â all she needed was a chance she can handle this role so long as the directors handle handle their end â a side question am i the only one who thinks she is betterlooking this year â i dont know whether its makeup better diet or even plastic surgery because i cant place what it is about her that looks better but while she has always been a hot chick this year shes frickin ravishing â i had a personal theory last year that emilia clarke was hitting the sauce a little hard based on her skin tone especially around the hands but i dont see any of those signs this year â that could explain it"

"Bear Island",2014-05-15,"id imagine that got would be very tedious to film but would be a fun place during downtimeâ i might be wrong but i think on average emilia has to film with green screens more frequently than a lot of the other main cast do maybe her performance is affected by that then again if she was a voice actor she should be used to having to act without the benefit of sets other actors costumes and so forth i really do feel like shes better suited to theatre not every actor is a camera actor and it doesnt mean youre not talented it just means your particular skillset isnt best suited for camera work in theatre its far more acceptable to ham it up and subtlety can actually work against you were she playing dany in a play i think shed be great she just hasnt shown herself to have the chops for tv dany imo"

"Stormland's Fury",2014-05-18,"â she obviously had a more positive reception in season one when her supporting cast included illyrio drogo viserys mirri maz duur irri doreah rakharo the wineseller etc and when she shared some of the focus with viserys â â viserys drogo and more jorah definitely took some load of her â i think most people agree that peter dinklage is one of the top tier actors the show has but there was one scene in season 3 where he was alone with shae and shes simply subpar even he couldnt save that scene and came across cheesy as well which shows that the supporting cast does indeed matter"

"of man and wolf",2014-05-11,"imo the scene was great until the part where they run out of the castle like bitches lol her speech was awesome the whole scene in the kennels was intense especially for the nonreaders but the only thing that bothered me was the dog threat and how they just ran with their tails between their legs â i get its because asha gave up on theon but it came off as cowardlyâ for people complaining about the shirtlessness in the book roose says ramsay is crazy and fearless so it makes sense also his fighting style shows how much of a psycho he isâ â i actually noticed in the sex scene they cut out the part where myranda slaps him that is in the trailers too graphic for hbo lolâ maybe the point after the slap was where ramsay gets all the blood because otherwise it looks like he got it from implied fighting or he just likes to self harm himself"

"ovis alba",2014-05-12,"yeah the reek writing was cool the bath scene was i dont even know how to describe it psychotically adorable in a disgusting way im sure its going to set ramseytheon shippers on tumblr crazy â thats why i actually in retrospect found the sex scene before was not as useless as i initially thought"
"Lord Varys",2014-05-12,"that one was really a joke come on guys the dreadfort would never be that vulnerable nor should asha be surprised that theon is not himself anymore after he was tortured partially flayed and castrated balon realized that when received the box why couldnt you â the scene afterwards is pretty good but this thing makes no sense in connection to the time line since roose already commanded ramsay and theon to take moat cailin back when he returned to the dreadfort in the beginning of this season so what did they do all this time nothing and where the hell is roose himself hiding in his dungeon"

"King Tommen",2014-05-12,"i feel like the people mad about the logistics of the episode are having a really tough time understanding the entire sequence and perhaps need a rewatch to get exactly what is going on there it was certainly a little rushed but i get what they were going for â my issue is more with the notion that they absolutely had to send yara on a mission in the finale which was going to result in her immediately heading back home just so they could find something for her to do before the kingsmoot in s5 the funny thing is they could have easily inserted some scenes with her and balon on pyke this season before he died that could have provided more background to their family dynamic and the ironborn in general that would have probably had the audience more on board with her character than this excursion did"

"of man and wolf",2014-05-12,"after thinking about it today i cant help but think it was kinda dumb for asha to just leave theon there without much of a fight after ramsay threatened her with unleashing the dogs i get theon was totally broken i get she might not want to risk further death of her own men to save someone who is clearly gone or no longer the same man she once knew but that is still her brother that is her blood family i could never leave a sibling behind to go through more torture and degrading treatment the thoughts in my head wondering what was happening at any time of day to my sibling or lovbed one would drive me mad and up the walls she should have fought harder for him or at the least given her all to get at the man who did this to him hes right there and basically laughing at you and not caring at all about what hes done to her brother and she flees she came off pathetic if you wont die for your own family whats the point of going on"
"King Tommen",2014-05-12,"it was always going to be the issue with this storyline if all they wanted to do was find something for yara to do this season the status quo had to be maintained meaning theon could not be rescued ramsay would not be defeated and yara would have to somehow be allowed to escapeâ any way you write around it you need to end up with this result so its going to come off unsatisfying in some form or another no matter what choices you make thats why i said that the only way this arc would make any sense is if they were ready to truly deviate and have yara be captured in the attack which is really what logic dictates would happen in this scenario that way it would have allowed her to be entered into theons story far earlier than she does in the book and allows for another dynamic to be introduced into the ramsaytheon interactions for the next season or so but they didnt want to alter the book narrative to that degree so everything has to be more or less reset which means you need to put on your suspension of belief glasses on to allow for the story to play out that way â for some the silver lining should be that its now much more likely the kingsmoot plays out fairly closely to the books in s5 because of yaras excursion she wont even be in pyke when balon dies so theres even more accuracy for you"

"Hath4",2014-05-12,"to me there were two points they were trying to acomplishâ with the attack on the dreadfort one was to show once and for all that theon is completly reek and complety in the grasp of ramsay second was to better flesh out yara for her storyline with the greyjoy uncles next season i think ateast on those two points it was succesful but there was no dought that this scene should have been better and more logical"

"King Tommen",2014-05-12,"there could be multiple reasons for cutting a scene of myranda dying the gruesome scene that needed to be edited down has already taken place its probably jon skewering karl at crasters keep because the director and dp that brought it up in the interview only worked on episodes 4 and 5 â however its possible that a reason the death was cut was because of all the attention the sexual violence to females narrative had gained in the media earlier in the season knowing that myranda is basically a disposable character they could kill or not kill offscreen and never speak of again a determination could have been made recently to just exclude that sequence so that they didnt have another female being used sexually and having something violent happen to her â but then again the scene may have been cut for reasons that have nothing to do with that we may never know"

"Wunhopkuendo",2014-05-14,"â can you come up with a more idiotic comparison â unanticipated mechanical failure and human error which caused multiple fatalities and compromised the mission before the area of operation was even reached versus encountering entirely predictable enemy resistance â if special forces had reached the location of the hostages and then run away because oh my god the kidnappers have guns then you might have a point â â as someone who actually served in the real special forces i do think i have an idea of what i am talking about the whole point of the comparison is that you can spend a month in preparation and have every possible variable planned out and then still have something come up that scraps the whole mission i have seen it happen in real life far more times than i can or will recall to you â the yara plan most likely hinged on a quick assault of the dungeons with a rescue of an imprisoned theon willing to escape with her the wrench thrown in to the mix was that theon was actually in the kennels and so brainwashed as to believe it was all a trick brought on by ramsey so the mission probably took longer than anticipated due to having to relocate theon and then was pushed to failure status when he wouldnt come and the bells gave away the element of surprise"

"TimeKills",2014-05-15,"surely it is obvious that when tyrion demands trial by combat shae looks stunned to me it says plainly that her agreement to give testimony incriminating both tyrion and sansa  in exchange for tyrions life  has just gone belly up i would guess tywin pulled the same trick on her that he did with jaime if she had just been forced to testify to save her own life  why would it matter to her that tyrion wants trial by combat look at cersei at the end of the trial scene she was quite happy with trial by combat as tyrion is still likely to die  cue mountain therefore seems likely that although just a whore and a fairly stupid irritating woman she had tried her best to save tyrions life the man who in her own small mind had dismissed her because she was just a whore she hates him but she still loves him enough to betray sansa worst i could say was that tv shae was naive shallow irrational headstrong and also pretty stupid so stupid it stretched belief fairly regularly but then so do the comments on this forum shae versus ramsey in the evil incarnate contest i just think the question is very odd edited by timekills 16 may 2014  0702 pm"

"Mad Monkey",2014-05-15,"i feel like the writers shaved a few iq points off of shae when they had her go from liking sansa to being paranoid and jealous of her it didnt really make any sense to me tyrion treated sansa with barely disguised terror and sansa acted like a walking corpse if she saw that as a threat she must have been watching a different tv series from the audiencelove those sibel kekilli interviews shes saying what i have been saying the shae changes were for nothing suddenly as an actor she finds her character in book shaes place and cant figure out how she got there so she cant figure out how to play her i sympathize watching it and knowing it was heading that way wasnt easy eitherthats my opinion there was this kind of odd snapback where shaes character development just kind of unspools tyrion and shae made the best decisions he gave her up and she went with bronn to the free cities apparently far from the lannisters clutches yet somehow she finds herself being marched into the red keep to give the same testimony that she gave in the books there has to be more to the story and i expect it will be revealed in subsequent episodes but i can see why its bewildering"
"Le Cygne",2014-05-15,"i dont think theres much more to it though she said she questioned it asked them dont make her say a line that sort of thing she seemed to just have to make sense of it in her mind in order to play the part"

"Le Cygne",2014-05-15,"i knew what you meant i just meant its never going to make sense i dont think theyll explain very well and if they do it still wont make sense i think theyll just be vague otherwise why would she be struggling with how to play it to the extent she had to fill in the blanks herself"
"TimeKills",2014-05-16,"why is she a fairly stupid irritating woman i think because the tv character seems to have no conception of her own danger which would be stupid also she ignores the clear description of the danger she is in from someone who clearly loves her more stupid she ignores clear warning from a master of spies who has no emotional ties that might protect her extra stupid in a palace full of spies she shouts and postures and flounces about in a way that became very irritating to me because i find stupid irritating especially in myself but also in this character that the actress made me like mostly it was like watching a headless chicken in a fox coop"

"Colonel Green",2014-05-12,"the thing that bothered me most is asha reaching the dreadfort by sea maybe i missed something but the dreadfort is not near the coast not even in the show maps we see at the beginning and even if it is its on opposite coast of westeros did she go around the whole continent so fast the dreadfort is on the weeping water a river that flows into the shivering sea â yes yara sailed around the continentâ she said that was what she was going to do in 310"

"Miodrag",2014-05-12,"just wanted to add here that in the first episode missandei told dany that 1000 slaves died building the great pyramid would have been nice to see dany make that connection to remind hizdahr and the audience that his father was still not innocent even if he didnt condone murdering the slave children again they make it look like dany just doesnt thinkâ when in reality its because the writers are the ones failing to make connections in their own writing â as it stands it looks like dd took the wrong message from danys crucifixions the problem really is not that some of them may have been innocent thats obviously a problem but dany never truly punishes them for the crime itself anyway the main problem is that it was ineffective it provoked the great masters without significantly weakening them she should have punished all of them or punished none of themâ â to tell you the truth i dont blame dany for crucifying those masters shes removing the foundation of their lifestyle their basic worldview the pillar of their culture  the notion that by their birth theyre better than other people that is the essence of the most oppressive systems in history one group of people is considered superior and simultaneously some other group is considered inferior simply because fighting a system rooted in such an oppression is never easy and practically its mutually exclusive with moral absolutism whoever thinks its possible to overthrow such a system with a clean hands is wrong in martins world just like in the period of human history martin modeled his world after slavery couldve been overthrown only by force eg a war and if you fight a war some innocent blood will be spilled will it outweigh the benefit is another matter but theres no place for moral absolutism there in short each and every one of those masters dany crucified was guilty of something pretty serious of course not all of them were equally guilty and not everyone of them deserved the same punishment but if slavery is the indictment  and it is a serious charge  then not a single one of them was innocent under different system some of those people wouldnt become villains under different circumstances dany wouldnt kill them all against some other opponent dany would possibly be the villain for what she did but this is not a different system and these are not different circumstances with her goal and her enemy i think danys doing quite fine actually in her shoes i dont think id be as tolerant as she is â but regardless of what i think its obvious how complex an issue danys mission is and martins very aware of it he makes her confused before the complexity  just like any sane and normal and wellintended person would be its one thing to sit behind the computer and theorize about danys missteps or heroics but its quite another to fight actual and grave injustice of epic proportions now to take that issue and to boil it down to simplistic irrelevant arguments a la i just want to bury my father that is one of the rare instances i cant help but think about how superior books are to the show i usually dont need such comparisons because the show is usually illogical or inconsistent or whatever on its own but this with danys war on slavery this is something that cant be discussed without referring to the books â if there is another story that so effectively and thoroughly and analytically depicts a fight against an oppression i surely dont know of it nothing on this scale and of this nature ever happened in actual history so only a fantasy story could tell such a tale and as far as i know no fantasy story ever so much as attempted at anything similar let alone pulled it if im right danys war on slavery is a unique story in many ways and now theres an adaptation of it meaning its only natural to compare that adaptation to its source material littlefingers and varys conspiracies and cerseis coup and aryas vengeance and northern rebellion with rw and all the other storylines of asoiaf while great arent as unique as danys is and they can be measured against other stories but danys war on slavery is for better or worse in a league of its own and judging by the first steps the last two episodes this adaptation is going to be a huge failure she had like two scenes in liberated meereeen and both were subpar suffering from moral simplification  one thing that can make this story practically unwatchable â im aware many readers dislike danys adwd chapters hope nobody would mind but i happen to think that in most cases that is because of some misplaced expectation that dany should already be in westeros or possibly because of tyrions and quentyns adwd chapters people had enough of essoss but for adaptation her stay in meereen is a gem its one great dialogue after another one impossible choice after another one difficult decision after another  all the elements of great drama are there in abundance while tricky in terms of production when it comes to writing danys adwd chapters are as adaptable as anything in asoiaf but if dd continue down the road they seem to be taking total neglect of the context its really going to be unwatchable"

"Florina Laufeyson",2014-05-12,"well there are alot of people who believe that actually myrannda was killed by ramsay last night but it was cut from the epiosde it would explain the blood on his chest when he enters the kennels plus in the very first trailer myrannda slaps ramsay yet we did not see that last night so some of the scene was cut plus it doesnt feel out of charcter because myrannda is also pychotic and enjoys sadism she is not the normal giri so iâ could see him keeping around a girl that shares his sadist mindset ramsay gravitates toâ those that enjoy the things he does ie being a pycho and a sadist i assumed that blood was from guys he mangled before getting to asha shrug"

"abrown9",2014-05-13,"â i got one real big nitpick with this episode that fucking goat raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaage if the show doesnt eventually have that guy come back with the bones of his kid im going to riot seriously im really mad about that snapping mad its incredibly important that the dragons nom on a human its the whole reason dany locks up her dragons come on fix it show fix itâ â â you keep raging about this â drogon kills goats in the books â this scene happened implicitly in the books â this scene in my opinion serves to enhance the obvious distress that the scene with hazzea will cause dany â i would be a little bummed if they didnt show the hazzea scene but the new material with hizdhar has already helped highlight the fact that the world is not as black and white as dany thinks it is in my opinion great episode â i understand the purpose of the asha scene remind people that the ironborn control much of the north remind everyone that ashayara exists close up the plot of asha going to war and highlight how broken theon is â i think a and b could be established through exposition and i think d has already been well established with the shaving scene â i guess they had to close up c though â i just wasnt a big fan in general â still great episode"

"Seneti",2014-05-16,"well i guess if tywin really wanted to lay it on thick hed be doing the following â 1 writing a letter to jorah about resuming his services as a spy which accidentally ends up in the hands of barristan  cue general dissent among danys advisors and possibly her banishing of both of them jorah for spying on her possibly barristan for being so close to the king that he surely knew what was going on  even though we know he didnt â 2 writing a letter to daario in the hopes that the second sons will abandon dany for an offer of lots of gold â 3 sending some of varys little birds to start a fire in her shiny new navy thus getting her stuck in mereen for good possibly ordering the burning of the woods around mereen in case the masters havent done that yet â 4 sending one of varys little birds to leave a message on the walls of meereen that makes it look like the masters were behind it all thus driving that wedge between her and the nobles of meereen even deeper"
"Colonel Green",2014-05-16,"but how does that achieve tywins objective of neutralizing danys army losing jorah might lose her one advisor and spite her but it will hardly cripple her it furthers his goalâ just because getting rid of jorah doesnt immediately cripple her doesnt mean it isnt worth doingâ getting rid of jorah by getting him busted for spying is an easy card to playâ for the rest he can devise more complex stratagems going forward â writing to barristan wouldnt make sense because thered be no reason for dany or barristan to believe anything tywin told him"

"Petyr Patter",2014-05-14,"i think the show sort of dropped the ball regarding the politicsâ â queen just means you married a kingâ her only real job is to have the kings children so he can have heirsâ she has no powers of state though her proximity to the king and social status typically translates into a type of authorityâ â however when robert died cersei called herself queen regentâ a regent rules for the actual king because he is still underageâ he or she has real power and authority â the show makes it sound like queen has power and regent is an afterthoughtâ of course tywin lannister had the money soldiers and reputation to wield actual power regardless of titlesâ when he realized cersei had no business being in charge of a company picnic he planned to send her away and probably claim the regency for himselfâ cersei was in no position to stop himâ â yet on the show it makes it look like by marrying joffrey margaery would become queen regent and that simply isnt trueâ margaerys pep talk to sansa about children learning from their mothers is a better description of the power she would haveâ"

"Miodrag",2014-05-15,"bryan cogman answering some stannis questions from an ew interview yesterday â the stannis storyline has been stuck with him fuming at his big table in dragonstone for awhile it must be fun to get him out and about again absolutely that was the idea when we first broached the subject of bringing in the iron bank for awhile the version was iron bank representativeâ tycho nestoris would come to dragonstone and meet on stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099> turf it just seemed like whenever we can open up this world and give the audience something new visually and take characters out of their comfort zone the better we thought it would be more dramatic and interesting to put stannis in the position of having to go ask for a loan itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a humiliating situation the stannis storyline is certainly more of a slow burn but it will pay off my impression of stannis is that he would be a very just king but would also be terrible at the job because has zero social game how can you rule without any understanding other peopleâ<U+0080><U+0099>s needs and motivations thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a valid question heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s learning though this was a teachable episode for him and another reason why he keeps davos around even though they donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t see eye to eye and davos commits what stannis sees as a little treason now and then davos helps him face these hard truths and through davos heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s slowly learning some lessons here he has to swallow his pride it was great fun having actors liam cunninghamstephen dillaneâ and mark gatiss all on the set in the same scene they have very different personas and different ways of working and it was great to see them bounce off each other â these answers actually contain all the reasons tv stannis is such a dull flat and utterly uninteresting character while adapting asoiaf a saga full of brilliant comingofage stories the showrunners took an arc that literally has nothing to do with coming of age stannis and turned it into  a terrible and cliched comingofage arc all the more terrible because of the actual age of the protagonist a fully grown mature and responsible man â here he has to swallow his pride cogman seems to think thats a good thing like he actually thinks its an interesting development to make a character swallow own pride well it is not especially in an epic story like asoiaf and even more especially with a character like stannis â first that theme  swallowing a pride  has generally been wornout for quite some time whatever i can say about the theme of pride and its importance and why its wrong to turn it into a simplified cliche a la pride is something to be swallowed tarantino said it better in his pulp fiction with butch the boxer storyline and pulp fiction happened 20 years ago one would expect got showrunners saw that movie and learned something from it â second in the world martin created swallowing a pride can be a very dangerous thing ned swallowed his pride at the end and died because of it had he refused to confess joff wouldnt be able to kill him the way he did robb decided to swallow his pride and ask freys for forgiveness and he died because of it robert decided to swallow his pride and tolerate the family he married into and was indebted to and he died because of it then we have jaime whose pride is taken away from him along with his swordhand after a brief period of giving up on life he rebounded by establishing another kind of pride for himself because otherwise hed probably see no reason to live anymore then theres theon a man who literally had to swallow anything that resembles a pride and at that point he really isnt a human being any more  only after jeyne pool awakens something deep inside him something that is inevitably connected with pride hes able to find some traces of humanity in himself even littlefinger and varys who are thought to have no pride at all may actually have a very vivid pride only hidden from the world in case of littlefinger its as good as proven while varys last appearance indicates the same and of course theres tywin a man whose pride was too artificial and deformed into arrogance of the most dangerous kind all of which means that pride is not something martin takes lightly either way you cant take it too far because it becomes arrogance tywin or jaime with both hands and you cant live of it especially if it isnt based in any reality any more robert but to swallow it is not a bit less wrong like with many other aspects for pride martin found the perfect balance while providing numerous different angles that illustrate the reality the balance is rooted in throwing all that away for some cheap nihilistic one has to swallow the pride to succeed philosophy is among the biggest mistakes of this adaptation and possible the biggest one from which many other mistakes stem â third boiling stannis down to a man who has to swallow his pride is a very very poor and unfortunate decision his arc is along with danys probably the most unique one among all asoiaf arcs other arcs and storylines while no less brilliant are comparable with and sometimes influenced by stories of other authors andor actual history stannis along with dany is not if theres another story of a ruler who actually saw the power of gods and uses one god in his struggle to win the throne he claims but ultimately refuses to succumb his will to any god because he rests his duties solely with his subjects i definitely didnt hear about it regardless of what one thinks of stannis his arc is a perhaps unparalleled storytelling and a masterpiece id add that touches some of the most important issues humanitys been facing forever our relationship with deities and our place in the higher order of things if there is one at all and it would simply be impossible to achieve if at the center of everything theres a man who has to swallow his pride it would be ridiculous the entire story would collapse the man who can defy gods he uses by the way wholl break rather than bend and who inspires the ultimate devotion he got from davos and cressen is not someone who has to swallow his pride â as is the case with danys war on slavery stannis arc is so unique its mindless and pointless to analyze an adaptation of it without comparing the adaptation with the

"Pod The Impaler",2014-05-16,"â the point here to me was that in the future dany might be wise to get all facts before passing judgment and implicating punishment which somewhat correlates to what we would see later with tyrion she makes the right decision for hizdahr but her arrogance at times during the conversation was a huge turnoff â after all she does come from a line of family that included the mad king and her own brother viserysâ â â â well yeah i would say i am generally in danys side when she resorts to wrathful justice but she has a dragons temper and also was raised by viserys in a tradition of arrogance and entitlement with a very distorted view of the world and herself in s1 jorah has to wake her up to the reality that the common people in westeros dont care much for who has the right to what seat of power in s2 she finds the qartheen perfectly willing to turn her away to starve save for 2 of the 13 who seek to use her and steal her dragons in s3 she wants to buy slaves to further her cause but her disgust at how the unsullied are made and her annoyance at the kraznys insults to her that convince her to crush astaporâ â so while i think dany has some good ideals and good instincts she is not saint daenerys kings and queens are not in the habit of being told they are wrong least of all by anyone sympathetic to their foes would stannis have done similarly  yes if he is willing to burn people alive i think so  and he would not be moved as easily by hizdahrs seeming anguish one he made his decision he would have stuck by it regardless would robb stark  compare the mercy he showed his mother with the lack of it which he showed karstark and his men he may have been right in moral terms but it undermined his rule â was dany right to crucify those slavers many long debates have been kicked back on this forum on just that issue she may have been just as wrong to feel bad for having done it and reverse her order to leave them nailed up as an example power is a curious thing i guess the right or wrong of it on whether the slavers appreciate her turn towards mercy and will obey her or whether they view it as weakness and see an opportunity to undermine her â spoiler book readers know the answer to this even if the exact situation same situation did not occur in the books edited by pod the impaler 16 may 2014  1112 pm"

"Lady of Dragonstone",2014-05-12,"i completely agree he practically is jaime at the beginning of the show he was cerseis creature in whole throughout season two we see him arrogantly curious about his companion brienne in the book we can see that he does care about her in whatever way  and i think they really did a great job on the progression of their non relationship from enemies to trusted friends and while that is happening jaimes heart is hardening towards cersei  now in season four we have him sending brienne on a mission to save sansa trying to save tyrion and promising tywin he will give up the white cloak and marry  all against cerseis wishes â his personality is spot on in portrayal i loved his sarcasm in the books and it is no different on screen nikolaj is dry and ironic in the perfect jaime way but it seems like he has toned down a bit in this season somewhat humbled by his injury"
"Lord Damian",2014-05-12,"i think he is clearly the breakout movie star from this series his is going to be an a list actor within 5 years thanks to agot and is looks he ought to have his agent pursue to be the next james bond villain or something i do wish his and tyrions hair was bleach blond since they atleast go to the trouble for cersei and danys hair to match the books it is the hair overall that is the slap in our face give away on the incest bastardy edited by lord damian 12 may 2014  1018 pm"

"Stannis Eats No Peaches",2014-05-13,"he does a really good job his bath scene last season was amazing and the oh shit face he pulls when tywin says done was one of my favourite bits of this episode"
"Angielina",2014-05-13,"absolutely agree with all the above posts nikolaj has shown some amazing work in his portrayal of a diamond of a character and how different light pulls out these aspects the more you look the more complex and fascinating this character becomes to see nikolajs interpretation of how jaime has progressed into his own identity and less a lannister has been inspiring â jaimes awareness of his depth has increased substantially since his time with brienne and how he is willing to go into the bear pit with tyrion also was heartwarming it is quite ironic when he comes to tywin with his willingness to leave the kingsguard and maintain the lannister line by living an ordinary life in exchange for tyrions life as jaime actually has become less lannistery this performance was artful on nikolajs part and imo there is no better match that i have seen on tv or movies today then the on screen interaction that nikolaj and gwen share i hope that we can see them together on screen again when game of thrones ends i am hoping the academy will recognize nikolajs hard work this year with an emmy since dinklage has already one the difference i see between peter and nikolaj is the peter is dramatic and commands the stage nikolaj is poignant subtle and a softer catalyst to those around him edited by angielina 13 may 2014  0503 pm"

"SeventySeven",2014-05-13,"nikolaj is quite something but ive been blowing hot and cold with jaime this season even if i completely ignore the fuck up of episode 3 i feel that jaimes characterisation is a bit all over the place this season i liked his scenes in this episode and the last scene he had with brienne was lovely but theres something off about him which i cant quite pinpoint â basically its what happened with jon for 3 seasons as well where the more i watched of him the more i was wondering who was this dude they called jon snow i just didnt connect the way i connect with him in the books its better this season though i loved what they did with jaime last season i hope the writing picks up because ncw can be way better than what weve see of him this season"

"Hangover of the Morning",2014-05-13,"nikolaj was absolutely fabulous in this episode i dont think that the trials scenes would be half as potent without his reaction shots also his plea for tyrions life was truly touching even if tywin obviously outsmarted him in that scene â jaime is the only person in the whole rooms that cares about tyrion so in that way he represents us as the audienceâ"
"Theda Baratheon",2014-05-13,"some great pieces of acting throughout the episode his reaction when tyrion started speaking up was heartbreakingâ"

"Envie",2014-05-13,"nikolaj has very subtle acting abilities i think hes really good and underappreciated except for his sexy looks far too much on the show other characters like tyrion get a lot more kudos because theyre playing a very difficult character jaimes character on the outside seems very simple  big handsome knight whos had his whole life handed to him on a silver platter and is a great fighter but killed a king and now has a complex its not that simple though jaimes underlying character is pretty complicated and conflicted and im so glad were finally seeing that this season with the brienne cersei tywin and tyrion scenes that heartbreaking look he gave tyrion when he realized tyrion wasnt going to keep his mouth shut like hed begged him to do was utterly to die for i wanted to hug himâ"

"Belisarius09",2014-05-15,"i think ncw is one of the best actors in this seriesâ yes peter dinklage is great but people tend to overlook everyone else that portrays their characters so convincingly â in my book ncw stephen dillaine charles dance ian glenn peter dinklage liam cunningham aiden gillen and conleth hill are the best actors in this seriesâ â oh and sean bean tooâ also a shout out to robert baratheons actorâ he did a great job too"

"stannisismyking",2014-05-15,"i agree with several posters above jaimes reaction shots in the background are so important the way hes observing the different family members and trying to process whats unfolding in front of him i much preferred this episodes scene with tywin to the one in 401â i loved jaime stepping up for his little brother and then the look on his face when he realises hes been played by tywin"
"KeeperOfOaths",2014-05-15,"i totally agree nikolaj is great he was perfect in the last episode apart from the moments you have mentioned his eyes during that scene where he takes tyrion out of prison to go to the court room his eyes expressed so much pain and sadness i dont even want to imagine his face in episode 10 oh the feels"
"NOT A TARG I SWEAR",2014-05-15,"jaime is the only one that loves tyrion this was palpable throughout the episodeâ one of my favorite scenes of this season was the jamiebronn sparring scene when bronn describes the trial at the eyrie and you can just see the switch flip on in jamie that he needs to actively help tyrion just one of many examples of him acting perfectly without words edited by not a targ i swear 15 may 2014  0426 am"

"Tyrion Hand of the King",2014-05-14,"im not sure if it changes much or if it does im not sure i mind depends how it plays out i think it actually nicely sets up a moment of surprise as people can assume that he would probably have the forces to attack kings landing again so his decision to go to the wall doesnt come of as he had no other choice anyhow but as a deliberatly made decision against kings landing and for the wall good point while having more men makes his victory against the wildlings less impressive it does make his decision to go to the wall more admirable and surprising considering stannis could use some positive pr so to speak with unsullied viewers i think this could have some benefits"

"Jon of the (Evil) Dead",2014-05-12,"hes better than dinklage in my opinion because his acting is way more subtle and understated but also more demanding i still miss the broken teeth and missing fingers but his performance just sells reek man and its cool that he didnt starve himself for the role christian bale style because that shit is dangerous"

"Envie",2014-05-13,"alfie has really surprised me with how well hes adapted to the degeneration of his character into reek it was easy to see him playing the cocky arrogant jerk he was at winterfell in the first season then when he started making huge mistakes and trying to impress his father and the horrific murders at winterfell after that  it all started him on that tragic transformationâ â but by this season the transformation is complete and we no longer recognize the theon greyjoy we loved to hate in the first two season now we feel genuinely pained and sympathetic to the trauma hes gone through now that takes some very good script writing directing and acting to pull off well id say theons story arcs is one of the most difficult to portray from the books â alfie and the writers who have coached him through this transformation have nailed it"
"Tixu Oty",2014-05-13,"man alfie was seriously awesome in this ep now we know for sure hes gonna kill it next season rheon also played a good ramsay though a bit too funny for me and their storyline was changed around a lot but it totally worked i loved it all"

"Jairion Lannister",2014-05-13,"he was very good and is handling the transformation well the closest weve seen to it so far hes doing well because its the sort of thing which can easily come across as overdone and over the top if you dont nail it he seems genuinely terrified every time hes around ramsay though always taking care with his words and its effective between the two"
"BlackTalon",2014-05-13,"great thread i agree alfie allen has not received the attention he deserves probably because he is so goofy looking and his role is not bad ass or sympathetic i was extremely skeptical when the casting was announced but he has more than won me over great acting all around especially in his baptism which is still my most favourite game of thrones scene â i also wonder if there is rivalry between him and his sister  just remember that humorous but still pretty nasty song she made about him i have heard he took it pretty hard i would have too if my sister had done that with millions of people laughing at me man  now he is just as successsful as she is probably doesnt make es much money as she does though edited by blacktalon 14 may 2014  1115 am"

"Hath4",2014-05-14,"i dont have a problem with the realtionship with mryannda she is a pychopath and i do not think it is out of charcter i can see ramsay keeping a girl around if she was in to the whole sadism thing he is in too we are not presented with the situation in the books so we have no way of knowing what ramsay would do if he came across a girl who also enjoyes inflicting pain on people plus we have already scene in epsiode 2 that he has a bad habit of feeding girls to his dogs so if i was a girl i would stay away as for the performance it does go over the top on occasion yes ramsay loves all the evil acts he commits he truly loves inflicting pain but sometimes rheon goes over the top and it bleeds into crackling comic villian martin manges to keep him somewaht more gorunded in the book he is still joyful about his acts of evil but is somewhat more seroius overall though i think rheon is doing a good job"
"Tixu Oty",2014-05-14,"rheon is doing a good job i agree with you on that what i mean is they made ramsay be a very different character and that change is hard to wrap my head around i mean joffrey was shown as a sadist in the show when he isnt in the books but the one character who is actually utterly horrible in the books they turn him into a cute funny guy in an evil way im exagerating a bit but you get the idea the gap is huge besides i really do not think book ramsay would keep that psycho myranda around definitely not ramsay doesnt like to be on an equal footing with anybody hes all about power and proving it by hurting people especially women but even in his interactions with all the other characters this guy has absolutely nothing nice in him he always got to get his point across that hes the bad guy and they all better fear him hes not going to play along like hes an ok boyfriend plus the ok boyfriend situation is never depicted anywhere in the books except in jons case if my memory serves me right and although it works for jon who is clearly a progressist ramsay it the last person id expect to see in that role"

"Hath4",2014-05-14,"yeah that scene was probably leading to her death the scene were she slaps ramsay was missing the episode came in short i have a feeling that ramsay killed her the scene was cut due to the sept and crasters scandal hbo probably looked it over and told them to cut it but for the girls that think ramsay is hot remember tansy thats all i will say edited by hath4 14 may 2014  0744 pm"

"Tixu Oty",2014-05-15,"i dont think that ramsays cruelties happening off page in the book made him less horrible if anything it made it more horrible to me like it was so horrible it had to be clouded in a certain evasiveness to be bearable and theon couldnt even stand to remember any of it clearly so yes the show has to show a little more stuff than the books without needing to show it all either its not how much they depict him that bothers me rather how they depict him but i guess well have to agree to disagree on that one"

"Asshat by the Shadow",2014-05-12,"i think it was foreshadowing aegon but i also think it was to set up a contrast between varys and littlefinger after last weeks episode a lot of unsullied will be paying more attention to littlefingers antics in his quest for power varys needs to be an equal to littlefinger so this scene was to indicate that varys has plans in the works as well my interpretation at least"
"yushkevitch",2014-05-12,"i was a little annoyed by that simply because i cant imagine a master of whispers like varys tipping his hand to anyone never mind an outsider like oberyn looking back varys motives through the first 3 12 seasons have been almost a complete mystery then out of nowhere he basically says hes after the iron throne very strange â my thinking is that this was necessary to help foreshadow his assisting tyrion considering varys testimony against tyrion it may be a stretch for viewers to believe he would then turn around and help the little guy escape and off his old man unless he had a fartherreaching motivation oh and then theres the matter of kevan way off in the distant future "

"Lord Varys",2014-05-12,"i actually liked that tidbit insofar as it gave a little of nonbrothel backstory on both characters  until it didnt but it would have been a little bit more interesting if oberyn had mentioned elia and her son in a conversation with varys wouldnt it could have worked easily enough since oberyn was in essos during roberts rebellion explaining why he did not participate in that war â and of course varys should have known pretty much everything that is to be known about oberyn so a lot of the conversation was exposition that didnt make a lot of sense inuniverse â on the other hand they really seem to start to move away from the varys serves the realm thing to he has ulterior motives of his own thats a good thing that came across well when he mentioned that he never forgets anything they could be really hinting at stuff here that was not yet touched upon in the books as of yet â that said does anyone else believe that jorahs revelation as spy is going to be by the little birds varys is apparently going to send to meereen very soon and if so why the hell would varys want to destabilize daenerys court if he and illyrio intend to motivate her to march for volantis if they are smart then jorah will be contacted by an agent of varys to convince dany to leave meereen and is overheard doing this by either dany herself or ser barristan"

"Envie",2014-05-12,"is it really that difficult to comprehend because he nods towards the throne when oberyn asks him what hes interested in does that mean he wants to sit the throne himself even my unsullied friends started arguing about who varus wants to put on the throne and why you dont have to take everything at face value and literally its ok to think for a few seconds about itâ â well said â i know two unsullied who got it easily enough they even mentioned the fact he was quick to point out to oberyn that he was no lord and did not want the title so they were pretty clear on the fact varys himself would never be a king or ruler hes not a lordâ â im not sure why so many people who debate on these discussions think everything in the show must be taken literally and that show only viewers must be too stupid to get hints and clues varys has made it clear he has no mortal desires and that his motives are purely in putting the right person on that throne his idea of who is right may not necessarily be the real aegon or the fake aegon in fact that debate rages on but the bottom line is  it doesnt matter if aegon is fake or real because there have been many pretenders one is on it now to the throne as well as conquerors and some were better than the trueborn king who was a mad man aerys not joffrey haha â varys wants power that much has been obvious from the start every show viewer now fully understands that the game of thrones doesnt mean the winner is the one who sits on it they know the winner is the one who successfully controls westeros through the throne by whatever means for tywin thats as the hand of the king for his grandsons for littlefinger it was his position of power over the thrones finances during roberts reign which are obviously in ruin but lf still used it to his advantage and for varys its his position as the royal spy and master of whispers  knowing and bartering secrets and paid favors is very powerful even tywin is somewhat cautious about how much varys knows â the scene with oberyn was well done it showed a little bit of varys power to both viewers and to oberyn oberyn needs to know this if hes to be the family that next sits the throne possibly via aegon or myrcella or both varys is making sure oberyn understands that his services and power are important tools for oberyns side of the game â edit i also think many people lost the subtle play of words and genders that was going on between oberyn and varys oberyn asking varys bluntly if he liked boys wasnt a sexual reference though it was literally  it was him asking who varys preferred on the throne he acted surprised when varys said he didnt choose boys or girls  but varys explained it and the subtle clue that passion and desire clouded ones judgement and put bad rulers on the throne varys absent those passions was able to see the potential candidates for what they were not their potential as mates lovers marriage matches for sonsdaughters etc etc which is all part of the game of thrones of which he does not participate he judges a ruler by their ability to lead not whether they are a king queen or potential family marriage alliance like so many lords do now that doesnt mean hes without his own devious motivations for who should be on the throne but hes pointing out that being a eunich exempts him from caring about the rulers sex edited by envie 12 may 2014  1133 am"

"Envie",2014-05-13,"i was starting to worry they were cutting some things for the future when varys was absent for so long there were a lot of kings landings scenes he probably should have been in with tywin and joffrey etc  anyone know why he wasnt in so many previous episodes but then i saw him at the royal wedding and now hes back again full force in exclusive scenes so im relieved i believe varys is the definite plot link between essos and westeros and whatever happens or whatever they choose to include will rely on his inclusionâ â that being said its definitely just speculation whether or not aegon will play an important role and be included prominently in the show or not i have to think that even if hes a fake its still really important for the overall story of westeros  at least up to the point we were left with in adwd which was young aegon leading his own host of men in westeros after sailing there and losing half his ships theres a lot of good material covering aegon from the young griff point onward that will make very good television material  particularly once tyrion joins their crew i find it hard to believe theyd cut aegon completely out of the show regardless of his endgame status as true king or fake pretender either way hes still a definite player in the game and providing a lot of storyline"

"Modesty Lannister",2014-05-13,"my take on this scene was that oberyn looking for an ally on the small council approached varys this made sense since pycelle and mace were obviously lannister toadies and tywin and cersei were nonstarters oberyn attempted to use sex with varys since that works with just about anyone right however sex is not an incentive for the enuch varys turned this approach from oberyn on its head instead of becoming oberyns ally he invited oberyn to become his ally given that dorne is the most likely supporter of aegon it makes sense for varys to make this opening with oberyn however varys couldnt simply say yo dude i have your nephew up my sleeve instead varys let oberyn know he was backing someone else for the iron throne and then just let oberyn contemplate on that while there was some danger to varys in taking this approach varys had to approach dorne at some point and this gave him the perfect opening i thought the scene was extremely well done very clever analysis of that scene kudos"

"Shortspear Rick",2014-05-12,"well you kind of answered your own question there you obviously know the leverage financial institutions can hold as far as opposing them with the brute force that is shown to be quite effective in this world well this particular bank has so much available capital that they can just buy the swords to protect them if the situation arises all of the free cities have banks but this one is richer and more powerful than all of them combined also the thing about a bank is that sacking it is a far more complicated task than sacking a castle killing the ruler and claiming victoryâ"
"Mad Monkey",2014-05-12,"some people also believe that the iron bank has a relationship with the faceless men and the sealord of braavos no one really wants to tangle with those combined institutions the iron bank alone has the resources to field massive sellsword armies if they do have an alliance with the most feared assassins in the world as well as one of the greatest naval powers in history it might be hard to get a big consensus to tangle with them â and even if the iron bank does not explicitly have an alliance with those groups realistically if westerosi lords invaded braavos to sack the bank the braavosi would have to defend them just as the iron throne would be obligated to defend lannisport if pirates out of lys tried to destroy it"

"Konradsmith",2014-05-04,"now we know why jaime and tywins confrontation in two swords was somewhat muted theyve milked it into another scene later down the line which i think is a good choice this time theyll have an even bigger disagreement and more sparks will fly â i really doubt thatâ bran or jon will show up because weve seen them so much in eps 4 and 5 the focus will be tighter and theyll give the trial yaras attack and stan with the ibobâ room to play out"

"averde",2014-05-05,"the ironborn and ramsays troops look fairly even in number in that scene and the ironborn guys seem to be better armed and armored and are supposedly the best killers on the iron islands interested to see how that plays out in anyway that makes sense and interested to see where asha ends up i also think its odd balon let his last chance for an heir run off on such a dangerous mission with such a little amount of men the whole situation is odd edited by averde 05 may 2014  1256 am"

"Fjordgazer",2014-05-05,"so this episode will have 2 major detours from the books going on stannis at braavos  yara at the dreadfort this one announced since last season the stan stuff could be played well to bring him back to canon since theyre streatching the wall storyline somewhat but the yara stuff has been discussed to death for a year now wheres she going i hope theyre not changing her whole story â the show seems very whimsical as to which storylines get stretched out with filler bran jon stannis and which ones are being moved along without bumps brienne theon dany keeping the pace and averaging both sides is the kl stuff"

"Colonel Green",2014-05-05,"my guess would be ep 408 it would tie in with gregors death while still giving arya enough time to get to the ship in ep 410 episode 8 is probably going to have to handle the hounds death already so the gift bit would be even more material for one episode though i guess it would be a fitting bookend to open that episodes arya plot with that bit and then close with arya refusing the same to the hound"
"Ignorant Bog Woman",2014-05-05,"no way man episode eight needs to end with spoiler the duel"

"Hath4",2014-05-05,"so im guessing ramsay kills myranda while they are having sex explaining the blood and scratches on his chest i think him shirtless is to show how fearless he is that is one of his major qualities in the books"
"Ghost from Winterfell",2014-05-05,"i hope theon doesnt betray yara he is not that far gone yet imo and helping her scape in some way would be a strong moment for him since we know from the books that he wasnt quickly turned into submission and that he could actually be a little defiant â how do we know roose is traveling to meet northern lords i wish he could be in the dreadfort during the action â anyway this gave me an idea of a scene that i think would be interesting roose meets with a random northern lord and manages to bullshit him that he had nothing to do with the red wedding and it was only for a matter of convenience and circumstances that he got the north while subtly threatening him into submission in some way the scene could play in a similar manner as tywin extending an olive branch to oberyn or the future scene of littlefinger manipulating the lords declarants that would cement roose as a master political player and a formidable bad guy to the audience and the thousands of unsullied who still dont pay attention to him and would give a good intro to the boltons storyline in season 5 â not that i expect something like this will happen just an idea â michael mcelhatton does say he is political animal through and through so he also seems to think a later scene with roose and ramsay is a bit heartbreaking while commenting on sons looking up for their fathers approvals this makes me think we will get the make me rue line this season due to recent controversies though i think the audience would go ballistic"

"Father of Dragons",2014-05-09,"what another informative recap that was right so well likely start with stannis following the trend of lastinrecap firstinepisode from the look on stannis face and his previous attitude hes probably not too happy about this idea of braavos with any luck other stannis fans such as myself will get the stan that disappeared in blackwater in the small council scene theyll be discussing daenerys and somebody will probably say something along the lines of we have bigger matters to discuss oberyn may bring up something about dorne and mace will make some sort of speech the topic of margaery and tommen could be confirmed by him the varysoberyn scene will happen before the trial im assuming i hope varys doesnt give away too much seems like well see the statements from ser meryn pycelle varys and potentially cersei well definitely get the im guilty of being a dwarf line i suppose shae is a possibility at some point jaime will confront tywin and well get a bigger argument between the pair that many people were expecting in the first episode the longawaited dreadfort scene will play out with so many possible endings and results to it all on the other side of the world in meereen well be seeing drogon doing his thing and roasting hazzea i think the father might make reference to the crucifixions of the great masters saying she has brought nothing but death and suffering to meereenslavers bay since she arrived absent will be aryahound jon bran sansa whom weve seen in every episode up to this point and briennepod edit as stated above we had no mention of shae which may be for spoiler reasons but is more likely to be because she wont be appearing edited by father of dragons 09 may 2014  1213 pm"
