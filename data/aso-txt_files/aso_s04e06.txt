1	Ran	2014-05-11	Non-spoiler discussion of the show goes here, for those who've not read the books or those who have but are happy to not actually reference them at all in discussion, taking each episode as it comes.
This topic should open automatically when the show begins airing.
2	AryaSansa	2014-05-11	Wow, why did Tyrion get so angry?Â  He should have realized Shae was testifying under duress.Â  And why would he demand a trial by combat, he's going to lose!
Â 
And why did Yara run away from some dogs?Â  The Ironborn should have been stronger, I expected more from them.Â  They had shields too!
Â 
Didn't like this episode, was kind of boring
3	tricky92	2014-05-11	Are you kidding me? The last 5 minutes gave me chills. I never read the books, but it's so obvious, and so genius what Tyrion has up his sleeve. It's going to be epic.
4	AryaSansa	2014-05-11	What does Tyrion have up his sleeve?Â  Bronn?
Â 
I can't imagine who will be on the other side.
5	tricky92	2014-05-11	What does Tyrion have up his sleeve?Â  Bronn?
Â

Â 
The previews have taken a little bit of the mystery out of it, if you have followed them closely since before the season started.
Â 
But, there are two things you need to ask yourself:
Â 
1) who is the one man that Tywin will call on to champion for him?
Â 
and
Â 
2) who is the one man that Tyrion will call on that will not turn down an opportunity to fight the man that Tywin will no doubt call on?

6	OccupyHarrenhal	2014-05-11	Wow, why did Tyrion get so angry?Â  He should have realized Shae was testifying under duress.Â 


Â 
Yes, the duress that he put her through, not anything from Tywin or his men. If you recall, the only way he could convince her to leave King's Landing was to insult and reject her, and she very much took it to heart.
7	Winterfell is Burning	2014-05-12	What does Tyrion have up his sleeve?Â  Bronn?
Â

Â 
If you figure out who will Cersei pick, you'll figure out who will be Tyrion's champion.
8	Fantasy Character	2014-05-12	Small question - who was the person sitting to Loras's left at the trial? They kept cutting to the Tyrells and it was from screen L to R: Margaery, Loras, Some Other Dude.

9	ambi76	2014-05-12	An extra in Tyrell clothing. OMFG this means there are other male Tyrells?
10	AryaSansa	2014-05-12	Â 
If you figure out who will Cersei pick, you'll figure out who will be Tyrion's champion.


Â 
Cersei chooses Jaime!Â  Then Tyrion chooses Bronn!
Â 
Then they fight for real!
11	AryaSansa	2014-05-12	Â 
Yes, the duress that he put her through, not anything from Tywin or his men. If you recall, the only way he could convince her to leave King's Landing was to insult and reject her, and she very much took it to heart.


Â 
Poor Shae 
Â 
Scorned by her lover, and coerced by Cersei to lie against her will.Â  I feel sorry for her
12	AryaSansa	2014-05-12	Didn't like the Yara scene.Â  They had 50 men, I expected more from the best killers of the Iron Islands.Â  Guess their bark is worse than their bite 
Â 
They should have killed the dogs in the cages.Â  Just stick a sword through the cage!Â  I thought Ironborn were more fearless, but I guess not.
Â 
And why was Ramsey fighting naked?Â  What were those cuts from.... sex?Â  I didn't see any knives in the sex scenes?Â Â Â  Ramsay is so ugly too, his eyes are so big and he has a super wide mouth and big nose and curly weird hair.
Â 
Best part of the show was the dragon
13	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-12	Â 
Cersei chooses Jaime!Â  Then Tyrion chooses Bronn!
Â 
Then they fight for real! 

Jaime would say no. He's already refused to kill Tyrion for Cersei
14	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-12	Though the huge contrast between someone who has not read the books and everyone who has regarding this episode and the characters mentioned is fascinating, thanks for the insight
15	andurilflameofthewest	2014-05-12	tyrions always managed to keep his cool, say the right things, Â but when shae took the stand..............
Â 
........ that was It...he flipped his lid!!!
16	Alizard Erebys	2014-05-12	If Tywin and Tryion both have to pic a champion, could it be that Tywin picks the Mountain, and Tyrion then chooses Oberyn??
Â 
Oberyn kills the Mountain et voilA !
17	AryaSansa	2014-05-12	Why would Tywin choose?Â  I think if Tywin chose, he'd choose an easy fighter, so Tyrion can live and Jaime can go to Casterly Rock.
Â 
But if Cersei chooses, she'll choose Jaime or someone better - but that person must be willing.Â  Maybe Cersei can somehow convince Jaime to fight.Â  But Tyrion's pick is definitely Bronn.Â  I guess it could be Oberynn, since that guy does nothing except have sex.Â  Why would the show introduce him just to have sex, he must be there for a reason.
Â 
I guess if Mountain was chosen, Oberynn would be the guy, since he mentioned wanting revenge in the first episode.
Â 
But Tywin needs Tyrion alive, so Jaime can go back... so he should just choose an easy opponent against Tyrion.Â  Too bad Ser Dontos isn't around.Â  
Â 
Did I mention how much of a letdown Yara was?Â  "50 best killers".. guess the best of the Ironborn was about the same skill level as a regular Dreadfort person, and much less than some dogs.
18	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-12	Tywin's a judge not the accuser/prosecution so I'm not sure he can name the prosecution's champion
19	Kiporman	2014-05-12	If Tywin and Tryion both have to pic a champion, could it be that Tywin picks the Mountain, and Tyrion then chooses Oberyn??
Â 
Oberyn kills the Mountain et voilA !


Â 
Nah, I'm positive that Tyrion's going to choose Jaime.
Â 
I mean, it makes sense. Since the beggining of this season, Jaime is training to recover his skill-at-arms. Maybe he is not in the best league now, but it doens't matter - he is Tywin's heir. If Tyrion has Jaime as champion, Tywin is fucked. Tyrion only loses if Jaime dies, so, if Tyrion dies, Jaime dies, and if Jaime lives, Tyrion walks free. And if Tyrion walks free, mind you, not only he would be free from Tywin's control, it would also means that essentialy everything they arranged would be proven as bullshit for the world to see. Which means that, no matter what happens, Tywin's gonna lose.
Â 
Looking really foward for this.
20	Alizard Erebys	2014-05-12	Ok, so given that Tyrion is accused by Cersei, if he asks a trial by combat that means him vs her. In any case, Tywin wants Tyrion alive or he loses everything, he's held by the balls.
Â 
We can reasonably assume that Cersei will name a champion as she wants Tyrion dead.
Tyrion can either name a champion to win and be free or stand for himself, thus provoking Tywin into acting.
Â 
I don't know if there is an order in who pics the champion but both may want to choose Jaime.
Cersei can pick him to corner Tyrion who would face a dilemma. Tyrion could answer by standing for himself thus puttin Tywin in an impossible situation (and force him to do something).
Tyrion can pic Jaime to corner Cersei and Tywin.Â 
Â 
I think that either way, picking Jaime will give explosive outcomes.
Â 
If Cersei wants to ensure victory, picking Gregor Clegane would seem only normal because he's the most fearful bannerman of the Lannister. In this situation, Tyrion won't even have to beg Oberyn to step in for him.
Â 
Well, you can always imagine surprises with characters that were not really in the spotlight lately.
Cersei could pick Loras Tyrell to get rid of him and piss off the Tyrell, she could pic one of the kingsguard... Same for Tyrion...
Â 
What are your thoughts?
21	CroS13	2014-05-12	Non book reader here, Picking Jamie is too much of a Liability for Tyrion, because he WILL loose, and you cant bet on Tywin to step in and overrule the trial. When would he step in and do something? when Jamie has a sword through the chest?
Â 
Either way if Tyrion picks Jamie, they both die, which would "Stick it to the man" so to speak, but what good is that when your dead? Tyrion has repeatadly said that he has no intention of dying just yet anyway.
Â 
Cersei wants Tyrion Dead at all costs, so picking Jamie is not a good idea either, i have got the vibe they arn't as close since he returned to the capital, with the whole you left me thing, also i dont think the rape done anything to gain rapport with her. Perhaps she also wants him dead, but not as much as Tyrion.
Â 
EIther way Tywin is in a pretty crappy position, where its either one of his sons, or both could die.
Â 
I think Cersei will pick the one person who can guarantee that Tyrion dies, and that is the Lannisters most feared bannerman, the Mountain. As others have said i doubt that tyrion would even need to ask Oberyn, but the question remains if he can fight or not? I cant remember if his reputation in fighting precedes him, but id assume so.
Â 
Cant believe people thought the episode was boring, not all the scenes can be about tavern wenches and great battles with dragons and white walkers!
Â 
Oh and Bronn is not going to chosen dam it!
22	Alizard Erebys	2014-05-12	Everything you say makes sense.
Â 
We can also imagine a Bronn vs Jaime duel that would mirror the training scenes they had.
Â 
But the duel wouldn't be interesting as Jaime stands no chance...
Â 
Tywin may not overrule the trial, but we don't know how far he can bend the rules to ensure his position...Â
23	MaximumPatlickicus	2014-05-12	What exactly did Bronn say when Tyrion asked him if he'd gotten Shae off on the boat? I don't remember the specifics, but at the time I remember feeling very skeptical and that Bronn did a lot of not explicitily saying "yea, she's on the boat and she's gone for good."
Â 
Â 
I think Bronn has ceased to be Tyrion's guy.
Â 
Â 
Â 
Â
24	Alizard Erebys	2014-05-12	He said he'd seen her on the ship. The Tyrion asks if he's seen the ship sail away and Bronn avoids the questions saying "She's fine, now go drink..."
Â 
So yes, when I saw this moment I thought things weren't over with Shae, yet.
Â 
Next episode may tell us if Bronn is still in Tyrion's service.
25	xBradzx	2014-05-13	Non book reader here.
My immediate reaction was that Tyrion would get Bron to fight anyone they picked.
Â 
However Oberyn vs The Mountain could be the real outcome so Oberyn can get revenge he wants, and he is supposed to be a deadly fighter!
26	tricky92	2014-05-13	Plus, in previews for this season and next week, we keep getting glimpses of The Mountain.
Â 
Also, in the season preview, there's a shot of Oberyn in some sort of battle where's he's pulling off some acrobatic maneuvers.
Â 
I'm not sure how the logistics are going to work out, but it seems pretty obvious that the trial by combat is going to come down to Oberyn vs The Mountain.
27	Thrones123	2014-05-13	after everything that has happened to theon, can't blame him too much, but he is a little bitch
Â 
now he's going to pretend to escape or whatever and go to that one castle ramsey is trying to take over and somehow let them in
Â 
and yeah the ironborn were pretty weak, can imagine dogs being tough to fight, but you are just going to run away right when it happens?
Â 
dany's storyline is still pretty weak, guess it's supposed to show how she is struggling with her newfound power, she is trying to rule in mereen but what about the other cities?
Â 
expected to see something about the night's watch with john returning to the wall and gaining more power, maybe that will happen next episode
Â 
oberyn vs the mountain is definitely going to be the two that fight, just a matter of how it ends up that way
28	Kirijax	2014-05-13	First time poster here. Been watching the series from Japan. Love this series and finally had to start reading the books, although I'm still in the first book. Have no idea who Tyrion will pick but the chapter title for episode eight is The Mountain and The Viper. Isn't Oberyn known as the Red viper or something because he puts poison on his swords when he fights? Or am I getting him mixed up with someone else? That fight would be EPIC. Can't wait to see Tywin's face when/if Oberyn agrees to fight for Tyrion.Â 
Â 
A hand to hand fight between Cersei and Tyrion themselves would be the most entertaining though.
29	orthorim	2014-05-14	What exactly did Bronn say when Tyrion asked him if he'd gotten Shae off on the boat? I don't remember the specifics, but at the time I remember feeling very skeptical and that Bronn did a lot of not explicitily saying "yea, she's on the boat and she's gone for good."
Â 
Â 
I think Bronn has ceased to be Tyrion's guy.
Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 


Â 
Bronn never denied the fact that he'd work for money. Not for anyone in particular, but for those who paid him. So I think it's a pretty safe bet he did work for Tywin when deciding to hand over Shae. I imagine his choice was to either take the Gold, or die. Bronn took the gold.Â 
Â 
Then again there's the unpredictable Shae - she might very well have been put on the boat safely as promised, only to bail at the last minute. She might even have decided voluntarilyÂ to testify against Tyrion (in exchange for safety). - given her testimony at the trial, she's completely lost it. She had to say certain things to keep her end of the bargain obviously - but there were plenty of things she did not have to say. Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned...
30	TheButcherCrow	2014-05-14	A hand to hand fight between Cersei and Tyrion themselves would be the most entertaining though.


I'm sure by "entertaining" you meant "awkward & embarrassing for all involved"
31	orthorim	2014-05-14	Non book reader here.
My immediate reaction was that Tyrion would get Bron to fight anyone they picked.
Â 
However Oberyn vs The Mountain could be the real outcome so Oberyn can get revenge he wants, and he is supposed to be a deadly fighter!


Â 
Yeah that would be the most sensible thing - and incredibly clever of Tyrion. In my mind there's no doubt who would win; it was mentioned that Oberyn is a fearsome fighter. We've seen a glimpse of his skill in the brothel scene where he stabbed some Lannister in the hand. Mountain and the Viper for EP 8 seems a dead giveaway - after all Oberyn is only going to win through speed and smarts - though hopefully not actual poison - against the Mountain. The mountain is huge and impressive but he's got to be slow at that size. And he's dumb as a sack of rocks.Â 
I seem to remember, too, that Oberyn gave some sort of speech in the brothel about the importance of speed.Â 
Â 
Even if they were evenly matched fighters - and the Mountain sure is fantastic at killing other knights in tournaments - the advantage would lie with Oberyn. He's got a cause. In fact this is the opportunity of his lifetime to avenge his sister.Â 
Â 
If tempers run too high somebody might choose Jamie. But as has been said Jamie will refuse to fight to kill his brother, and Tyrion won't choose him when he has Oberyn just itching to kill somebody.Â 
Â 
Total speculation - I won't ever read the books, it would take away half the fun in watching my most favorite show ever - but I think Cersei will choose Jamie, he refuses, then she chooses the Mountain as that's the best fighter available. Then Tyrion chooses Oberyn and things will get awesome...
Â 
PS if this is the EP 8 title then what's EP 7? An hour of Denaerys running through the desert? Ugh.
32	valirpaz	2014-05-25	Total speculation - I won't ever read the books, it would take away half the fun in watching my most favorite show ever


See and I'm considering starting to read. Because once this season is done I'm not sure I can wait all the time until the next season. 
Â 
Â 


but I think Cersei will choose Jamie, he refuses, then she chooses the Mountain as that's the best fighter available. Then Tyrion chooses Oberyn and things will get awesome...


I agree the fight will be Mountain vs Oberyn for reasons that have already been mentioned. But I can not see Cersei choosing Jamie. He only has his left hand, and apart from Tyrion and Bronn nobody knows he's even practising with it, therefore she would have to think he'd lose. Choosing Jamie thus would mean for Cersei to lose her one brother (and father of the king) and at the same time have Tyrion going free. She's evil not dumb.
Â 


PS if this is the EP 8 title then what's EP 7? An hour of Denaerys running through the desert? Ugh.


I know we're now all waiting for this fight but that's a little bit of an exaggeration. We have Arya, Brann, Jon, possibly the wildlings, the Vale - you could fill an episode with them, without Kings Landing, without Denaerys.
.


and yeah the ironborn were pretty weak, can imagine dogs being tough to fight, but you are just going to run away right when it happens?


I agree with that. Picking the best warriors, entering the castle no problem and then fleeing from the dogs? Not portrayed so well I think.
Â 

dany's storyline is still pretty weak, guess it's supposed to show how she is struggling with her newfound power, she is trying to rule in mereen but what about the other cities?


I actually thought that this short piece of her story were nicely done. In all the last episodes she always was the shining queen, idealistic liberator, everything was so easily divided between poor slaves and evil master, seemed you could just rush from city to city. Now she's realising that it's not black and white, and also that the day to day business of ruling is exhausting, difficult and tiresome. That only Mereen was shown doesn't matter, it is an example how it is one the one city, so considering she has to rule more cities it means her task is even more difficult.
33	Ran	2014-05-11	Share your thoughts!
34	Carey Snow	2014-05-11	Very nice episode! 9 for me.
35	Ser Jake	2014-05-11	Fucking great episode, no complaints. They nailed the trial!
36	AnotherCrannogman	2014-05-11	My first ever 10.Â  The Tyrion speech and the trial were perfect! Shae was awesome.
37	doghouse	2014-05-11	Everything before the trial was whatever. The trial MADE this episode and I keep re-watching Dinklage's performance. These are the episodes I live for. Perfect score.Â
38	Widows_Blood	2014-05-11	Fucking ten. From Davos pump fisting speech to Peter Dinklage owning shit. Best episode of season and maybe one of my favorite overall.Â
39	KalibakCruel	2014-05-11	10. Even if I hated the rest of the episode (I didn't, it was great) Tyrion at the end was amazing.
40	Batavian	2014-05-11	Awesome! It had everything. Trial. Braavos. And Drogon!
10!

42	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-05-11	I like it. Specially Stannis scene for a change. 
The trial was done nicely.
However I wont give it the highest grade because the Asha-Ramsey scene sucked as hell. Im so tired of the "almost reunion" pointless scenes. Done many times with Starks and now with Greyjoys.
Its a 7 for me.
43	YourMomsBox	2014-05-11	Great episode made that way by the trial scene. Loved loved loved the acting by Dinklage.
44	Fez	2014-05-11	9/10
Â 
Everything Stannis/Davos and Kings Landing was great, really great. The Dany stuff was good, the Dreadfort was kinda 'meh.'
45	ohpooratlas	2014-05-11	I gave it an 8 if only because the whole Yara plot was utterly pointless.
Â 
The trial was gold though. Emmy nom for this Peter Dinklage for the "confession?" Can we all agree, yes?
46	Kikiadiamond	2014-05-11	Dinklage rocked this episode.
47	King Tommen I	2014-05-11	Very nice episode! 9 for me.


Â 
Ditto!Â

49	Jamie Lannister	2014-05-11	8/10, mostly for the trial. Asha's little trip was a baffling waste of time, but Christ... that trial. Even Jaime's early role in it fit perfectly.
50	lostinwesteros	2014-05-11	Tyrion and Jaime were Awesome! Â Actually, all the key players connected with the trial were. Â And Shae -- I can't wait for her to get hers!
Â 
ETA: Â I gave it a 10!Â 

					
					
							Edited by lostinwesteros, 11 May 2014 - 09:03 PM.
51	FNF	2014-05-11	9. My favourite of the season for sure... The filler scene with Asha was pretty pointless but was still better than Craster's keep because it didn't drag on. Ramsay and Reek scene was good, and the rest was outstanding.
52	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-11	The trial was flawless. Great episode.Â
53	Peachie	2014-05-11	Asha/Yara's side trip to try to rescue Theon was a little pointless but Theon + Ramsey made up for it and brought the score back up to a nine for me. Even though I know what happens with the trial, it was still fantastic.
54	AryaSansa	2014-05-11	I giive it a 6, was kind of boring  Â  Seeing Stannis get a bank loan?Â  Why would the bank give an evil religious maniac a loan?
Â 
Â 
Watching Dany doing meetings was boring too 
Â 
Yara attacking Ramsay was kind of a let down too Â  I thought Ironborn were stronger, and they had shields!Â  Ramsay was naked and had a few dogs 
Â 
And why would Tyrion demand a trial by combat, he's going to lose!Â  Shae was obviously under duress, probably had to say those things or else she'd die by Cersei.
55	Lord Godric	2014-05-11	The first 10 I've given this year! The trial was amazing, the final scene where he demanded trial by combat gave me chills, it was acted nicely and the produced wonderfully.Â
56	Colonel Green	2014-05-11	Braavos:Â  Clearly setup for later, but at least they clarified the size of Stannis' forces.Â  Plus, Salladaor Saan gets his obligatory one scene per season (that's such a weird recurring character).
Â 
Dreadfort:Â  Single most pointless part of this season to date, and I'm including the brothel scenes.Â  After the setup given to Yara in the season 3 finale, that was an incredible whimper.
Â 
Meereen:Â  Eh, okay.Â  Amazing CGI on Drogon.
Â 
King's Landing:Â  Terrific stuff all around.
57	C0bR	2014-05-11	9
Â 
I was about to give it 7 because of too much cringeworthy Shae speaking, but Dinklage saved it
Â 
So my only complain is the lenght and the lame Ironborn/Dreadfort guys fight
58	makchamp	2014-05-11	That ending thoughÂ 
Epic
Â 
Was waiting for the trial episode since episode 2. It did not disappoint. Just sad that it ended in a huge cliffhanger.Â
59	tito5601	2014-05-11	cant give it a 10 cause the yara scene started of nicely but ended up being rlly bad when she escaped, the stannis scene and the trial was amazing tho
60	Ran	2014-05-11	Best episode of the season so far. Gave it an 8, which I may decide to revise up to 9 later. Why not a 9 right off? Well, the Greyjoy business was not well-executed (the Reek-specific stuff, yes, but the stuff around it, no), in shades of the Craster's Keep matter. Plus Emilia Clarke's vacillating performance is indeed started to bug me. The trial was exceptional though.
61	ToTheWolves	2014-05-11	I feel like the asha/yara storming the dreadfort was sloppy and pointless I don't understand why they ran from two dogs and they were armed. But everything else made up for it I especially liked the whole part with Jamie and tywin.
62	jarl the climber	2014-05-11	I gave this one an eight. The strongest episode of the season. Yara/Ramsey was a little weak and cost the episode a point. The trial was great, Stannis storyline was good, Hizadar came across as a sympathetic and interesting character which was a good change from the book where he seems to be a sleazeball, good episode for Clarke, great episode for Dinklage, Tyrion took a big risk asking for a combat trial without a champion lined up and calling Joffrey a bastard strongly insinuated the rumors about Cersei and Jamie, much ballsier than in the books, where his actions were more measured.
63	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-05-11	I feel like the asha/yara storming the dreadfort was sloppy and pointless I don't understand why they ran from two dogs and they were armed. But everything else made up for it I especially liked the whole part with Jamie and tywin.


Â I agree, I think the Asha sequence started out promising and then ended a bit clumsily. Not only did they run from the dogs, but Ramsey apparently gave them enough of a headstart to actually avoid getting caught by them, which is uncharacteristic of him.
Â 
Â  Overall though, I give the episode an 8. I liked the Trial scenes.
Â
64	Raksha 2014	2014-05-11	9, a great episode; almost as good as the Blackwater in S2. Â (would have been a 10 without the burned goat/child confusion and Ramsay/girlfriend porn and Yara & her fearless Five or whatever fleeing from a couple of dogs)
65	rocksniffer	2014-05-11	8/10
Â 
at first i was leaning towards a lower score but the trial and the bit with Ramsey washing Reeks back made up for the pitiful effort to rescue him...i mean how did they get away....after (i think) he let the dogs out???
Â 
but overall a good episode with killer moments during the trial and the addition of the Tywin-Jamie moment... Â
66	Javi Marcos	2014-05-11	The episode is almost perfect (Yara's plot was dumb). I voted a 10 when in my heart is a 9 in order to compensate the usual hate.
67	of man and wolf	2014-05-11	Those dogs are rather large. I'd run from certain types of them as well even if armed.Â 
Â 
Like Kangals and such...they can kill wolves, wouldnt be much trouble killing humans.
Â 
Â 
Anyways I dont think Ramsay actually let the dogs out. They just decided to leave and Ramsay was content with the threat.

68	Dain Storm	2014-05-11	Asha scene was pretty useless, and the fight scene what's pretty bad. Other than that and Shae, 9/10.
69	Nictarion	2014-05-11	8/10 Because of the trial and Dinklage, would have been higher if the rest was as good.

71	JonDunn	2014-05-11	I assume something worse will happen with the dragons later than killing a dumb sheep, in order to justify how she chains them up .Â
72	lostinwesteros	2014-05-11	Yeah, the Asha scene was horrible. Â And pointless, unless it was to show Reek's more advanced disintegration, and that part was well done.
73	SerJorahMormont	2014-05-11	The trial was awesome. Can't wait for the mountain and the viper
74	Ser Blake	2014-05-11	The trial was probably the best single scene in the entire series.Â  They freaking nailed it.Â  Honestly I may have gotten more emotional and more chills at the trial than I did during the Red Wedding.Â Â  Peter DInklage just locked up his Emmy.
75	Raksha 2014	2014-05-11	The trial was probably the best single scene in the entire series.Â  They freaking nailed it.Â  Honestly I may have gotten more emotional and more chills at the trial than I did during the Red Wedding.Â Â  Peter DInklage just locked up his Emmy.


Â 
Finally, finally, the real, angry, Tyrion appears and is pushed over the edge. Â 'Bout time this Lion bared his claws!
76	raj34	2014-05-11	The trial was probably the best single scene in the entire series.Â  They freaking nailed it.Â  Honestly I may have gotten more emotional and more chills at the trial than I did during the Red Wedding.Â Â  Peter DInklage just locked up his Emmy.


Â 
I completely agree, and for me it was totally unexpected. The trial was the most riveting 20 minutes of the entire series so far.
77	Gannicus	2014-05-11	Cogman nailed it.
Â 
Kings Landing was perfect.
Â 
Aside from the Dreadfort filler this was a fantastic episode. The best episode of the season gets a 10.
78	High-born Plumber	2014-05-11	Long may Tyrion run!
79	darksellsword	2014-05-11	I gave it a solid 10 .If you won't give a 10 for the trial scene alone then you are dead inside. The dreadfort scene was a bit odd but only from a book readers point of view. They are Ironborn and he was their prince and he was shitting himself and out of his mind he wanted to be caged up with the dogs.I think that was perfectly executed the Ironborn despise what Reek is no wonder Yara said Theon was dead. I have to go with the Emilia Clarke critics tonight, that scene with Hizdar was cringe worthy to the extreme, hopefully they can recover what she lost tonight with more vulnerabilty and emotion in her performances having said that I think the writing hit the right note The trial was fantastic Peter Dinklage was phenomenal. I liked the small council discussing Daenery's especially Tywin complaining about how stupid Joffrey was for dismissing ser Barristan.I wonder will people be complaining about the white washing of Tywin. The only things that I didn't like at all were the Vary's and Oberyn discussion and Oberyns "and did you fuck him like it was his last night on earth" Just thought it had no class. overall I thought it was a great episode by far the best of the season so far. It had a dragon burning things up and a lion tearing people apart
80	Scrambled Aegon	2014-05-11	The incredibly elusive 9/10.
Â 
The only reason it doesn't get a 10/10 is because it wasn't Blackwater. It was essentially a 10/10.
81	Honey Bee	2014-05-11	I enjoyed this episode. I feel that the episode had a nice flow to it. Viewers see the ties from the beginning of the season, plans are coming to fruition ie Stannis/Davos. I really enjoyed the Iron Bank scenes. I'm sure it gave Stannis more street cred from some of the Unsullied viewers.
Ramsey, Reek, and Yara scenes I also enjoyed. I believe that to say it is pointless is a bit of an exaggeration. I can agree Ramsay/naked girl scene was silly but I enjoy the actor who plays Ramsay so... But they did convey Reek's loyalty as well as his mental state. I think it's a good stepping stone to where the show plans to go in the next episodes. Obviously they can't leave us hanging on Reek's story.
Danny's scenes were great. The throne is a bit more than she bargained for. The dragon looked amazing. The flow of the scene was nice. I didn't know what was about to happen and then Drogon came up out of now where.
Tyrion's trial was absolutely riveting. I loved the acting. It was spot on. I was so emotional. The ups and the downs. I could go on.
I gave this episode a ten. I was very satisfied with it.
82	cybobbie	2014-05-11	I had to give 10 just for the trial scene, because the last minutes of it was simply awesome! As many I didn't like Asha's scene at the Dreadfort, but I have to say that when the trial started I totally forgot about it, just retained the great scene of Davos and the trial, both made this episode one of the best!
83	franko99	2014-05-11	10
Â 
The trial was perfect, probably the best 15/20 minutes so far in the 4 seasons. Emmy for Peter!!Â  
I love Jaime/Tywin scene
Â 
Â 
BraavosÂ  
Â 
Meereen was ok, and that's saying a lot since I hate Dany 
Â 
My only complain was that Yara attack seem a bit pointless, but it was still goodÂ

I agree with you 100%.
85	Ser Dank the Jedi	2014-05-11	Gave it an 8, and now I feel stupid. Â Should've given it a 10.

Dinklage absolutely crushed it, as did Cunnigham. Â The Dreadfort scene was very exciting. Â Apparently Yara can run pretty fast. Â Watching the Iron Bank scene, I said to my friends, "Man, I need a palace." Â Watching Dany's scene, I said to my friends, "Fuck that, I need a pyramid!"
Â 
How about that Drogon? Â Someone's been eating their Wheaties!
86	Newstar	2014-05-11	Cogman crushed it. Sakharov crushed it. Alfie Allen crushed it. Liam Cunningham crushed it. Mark Gatiss crushed it. Everyone crushed it.
Â 
Give Dinklage the Emmy now.

88	Bluecore	2014-05-11	This was a good episode. The trial was awesome. The Dreadfort scene was not necessary and felt out of place. Although, I knew they had to do something like that when they set themselves up for it at the end of season 3.Â

The acting blew my mind!!!! I 1,000x 'yes' this post.
91	Stannisrex	2014-05-11	Initially gave it a 9. Changed it to a 10 because I've come to realize the Dreadfort scene was about Theon, not Yara. As far as establishing Theon's identity as Reek, that scene nailed it.
92	Belisarius09	2014-05-11	I really liked it.
Â 
The trial scene was great.Â  the Stannis Davos Braavos scene was great.Â  Salhador Saan is back! Hizdar zo loraq was well done in the Dany scene.Â  (calm down my lovelies, we'll see the dragons roast a kid later, they need an excuse to cage the dragons they can't afford to cut that out).Â  I liked seeing asha (yara) again, but I didn't like the pointless subplot they made up out of thin air for her.
Â 
Everything else was great, but that made up just for the show raid on the dreadfort was really poorly done.Â 
Â 
therefore 8/10
93	Martini Sigil	2014-05-11	I gave it a 9, only because the Yara thing seemed rushed... especially when the episode ended 8 minute beofre the hour... Ramsay steals every scene he's in.
Â 
But a great episode
94	Wookiee	2014-05-11	9 from me. Â Lots of plots I was worried about getting dropped are doing well, my fears about Shae's role being changed were unfounded, Tywin manipulates everyone, Varys gets to be dramatic, Tyrion gets to be awesome, a badass dragon, Dany learning it sucks to rule. Â The Asha invasion was strange, but did a good job showing us just how much Reek is broken.
Â 
I always love Sallador Sahn. Â The random naked girls were a bit blatant (I feel like someone went "Oh, man, last episode didn't have anyone nude. Â Can we set the next one in a bath house? Â Also, can Ramsey have sex?"), but it was really nice to see a happy Davos. Â Stannis got to be Stannisy ("I am Stannis Baratheon. Â I don't like anything, but I'm the King!"), and I loved Oberyn's "What debt?" question.
Â 
This episode got me excited again, which is worth a 9 on its own. Â
95	FalseKnight	2014-05-11	Best episode of the season so far. Gave it an 8, which I may decide to revise up to 9 later. Why not a 9 right off? Well, the Greyjoy business was not well-executed (the Reek-specific stuff, yes, but the stuff around it, no), in shades of the Craster's Keep matter. Plus Emilia Clarke's vacillating performance is indeed started to bug me. The trial was exceptional though.

All due respect, Ran, I think they did the Greyjoy plot because viewers don't have Theon's thoughts. They didn't see how lost Theon really is. After Yara said that her brother is dead, my unsullied friends' and family members' jaws collectively hit the floor.
96	sastelise	2014-05-11	Slow build to a fantastic ending. 9.
97	Sages	2014-05-11	Some of my favorite quotes from people commenting on the show tonight.
Â 
"tyrion puts the imp in pimp"
Â 
"Impin aint Easy!"
Â 
"the imp deserves an emmy, an oscar and a grammy"
Â 
"That monologue from Tyrion was the best thing they have ever said on the show. Seriously, another Emmy please!"
Â 
"There's a lot of great acting in this show but wow, Peter Dinklage stands taller (lawl?) over everyone else... He's just plain ol' too good"
Â 
"Peter Dinklage continues to prove why he's one of, if not the best things about this show! he's just perfect in almost every scene he does"
Â 
I only wished that the trial took the entire episode. It was too short! But I guess short but sweet!
Â 
Great great final 20 minutes. Tyrion completely owned this episode as we all knew he would. But I didn't expect his acting to be that good. I mean wow. Everything from his facial expressions, body language, voice intonation it was just great acting. I wish he had more screen time with his monologue. Wonderful performance.

98	Ran	2014-05-11	FalseKnight,

Like I said. The Reek specific stuff was good, i.e. showing how far he is gone. But the stuff leading up to it and following it is nonsensical. They should have gone for something other than a commando raid on the Dreadfort.
99	johnnysd	2014-05-11	I feel like the asha/yara storming the dreadfort was sloppy and pointless I don't understand why they ran from two dogs and they were armed. But everything else made up for it I especially liked the whole part with Jamie and tywin.


Â 
Â 
They didn't run from the dogs. She gave up on Theon. Which shows how far Theon is gone and sets up the Kingsmoot. It was an important scene if a little clunky for non book readers.
100	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-05-11	Gave it a 9. Very close to 10 though. Brian Cogman really should write every episode.
Â 
I know people are complaining about the Dreadfort stuff, which honestly was kind of odd at the end/escape, but getting to see Alfie Allen as Reek was amazing. I suppose we're supposed to believe Asha has just realized her brother is ruined and is no longer Theon, which I think would've worked ok if they spent a bit more time on it. I think Cogman tried to write around that whole eventually pointless plot, but it was kind of worth the anti climax just to see Alfie be a perfect Reek. Everything else was perfect. Davos' selling of Stannis was so fucking amazing. The respect and love for Davos from Stannis came a bit later but it's there now.
Â 
NCW is so good at conveying emotion with just facial expressions, and Dinklage really did well. Such a great overall episode that it's honestly made me rethink my previous votes because this is how the show should always be. I can't wait to rewatch it.

101	Antoinetta	2014-05-11	I'd rate this 10 out of 10. Tyrion ripped my heart out for those few passionate minutes.  I just wanted to slap the evil glare off Cersei's face.
102	JonDunn	2014-05-11	I think the Dreadfort scene was fine. Â Â
103	Sages	2014-05-11	FalseKnight,

Â 
Yea I didn't much care for it. Almost like all the ironborne possess the magical gift of secretly penetratng castle walls. Never mind a siege. Just kill a few guards and you are inside the castle taking names no problem. And then all the build up last season and then a little more this episode al for a 5-10 minute showdown. Lol, that scene between reek and Ramsay felt longer and more impactful. But then again as its already been pointed out I've read the book so maybe its different for show viewers only.
104	Stannisrex	2014-05-11	FalseKnight,

Seems quite harsh to dock the entire episode a point because of 1-2 minutes of a 50ish minute episode.
105	Ambitious Lannister	2014-05-11	Peter Dinklage is one hell of an actor.Â
106	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-05-11	Seems quite harsh to dock the entire episode a point because of 1-2 minutes of a 50ish minute episode.


Â 
I think 1 point is fine, 2 points is a bit harsh because the acting was so great on Alfie Allen's part that it almost made it all worthwhile. I think it's tough to rate this one below a 9. Short of major action like Blackwater it's rare to get an episode this good overall. Honestly the dreadfort stuff would've worked better if Asha was outnumbered and you really felt she could barely recognize Theon anymore. It was relatively good intent that didn't work fully because they didn't give it more time (I'm talking like 1 minute of screentime).
107	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-05-11	Stannisaurus Rex would have been a better name.
108	SerMixalot	2014-05-11	and even had Salladhor San!Â  10 for me!
109	Stannisrex	2014-05-11	Stannisaurus Rex would have been a better name.

But Oedipusaurus Rex doesn't have the same ring to it...
110	ToTheWolves	2014-05-11	Also! Eventhough I didn't really like the dreadfort scene. Yaras/asha speech was awesome!! Also how fucking badass was Ramsay!?!
111	Er Rn	2014-05-11	8/10
Really good. Loved the trial. Loved seeing Braavos. Dany was fine. Davos was good. Was happy to see Sallador Saan again, but that scene was a little long and was used to meet the naked women quota. I didn't care for the Ramsay sex scene or the Asha stuff.
112	rmholt	2014-05-11	9. Show Shae wandered too far from Book Shae & this ep pays the price. Also a boat from Pyke to Dreadfort? Seriously? And Pycelle specifically said Tyrion didn't get Strangler from him in the books so it clashed here.
ETA : really Titan of Braavos? Nothing to say?
Only complaints listed due to spacetime limitations

113	~DarkHorse~	2014-05-11	I gave it a 9
Â 
Good-
Â 
The intensity and emotion behind Tyrion's 'confession' got the adrenalin flowing and goosebumps appearing. Forget "Dacarys" that was the most powerful scene of the series imo. Hats off to Peter Dinklage! They better not hold him backÂ from going dark Tyrion....he owns that stage!
Â 
Oberyn- His wit and badass persona really shined through (not standing up when Tywin enters chamber,Â "yes, we get it you have allot of poison!"Â and asking Shae a very serious sassy question). Yet, he also seemed to be trying to throw Tyrion a bone by questioning the witnesses....showing he is a decent guy and cool. Not just Bisexual.Â  I also liked the hints of theÂ him poisoning Tywin theory.
Â 
I loved Jaime's concern for his brother and Margaery looking guilty (on her grandmothers behalf) whenÂ they showÂ Sansa's necklace. She knows Tyrion is innocent and her guilt is showing.
Â 
Dany getting educated onÂ her inaccuracy of "I will serve injustice with Justice" Hopefully, the Unsullied willÂ start questioning Khaleesi's badassÂ actions. Â 
Â 
Stannis not being impressed with the Titan. His facial expressions are comical!
Â 
Varys's hidden agenda in looking at the IronÂ Throne (desires distract you from power) his goal is the Iron Throne....for Aegon!
Â 
Bad-
Â 
Yara's speech was very inspirational and powerful but wow, they had it filtered with Ramsay porn. What a way to cheapen a badass scene! That is being added into the unnecessary Sex bundle. I'm also annoyed she ran away from Dogs!

					
					
							Edited by ~DarkHorse~, 11 May 2014 - 10:55 PM.
114	Bryden88	2014-05-11	10. I loved every bit. Yara was the weakest part and yet I enjoyed that immensely. Even though I kinda like Yara - as both a book reader and a show lover, I take a smug satisfaction as a pro-Stark fan in watching Ironborn flee.
Â 
Â 
Also... EMMY FOR DINKLAGE DAMMIT!
115	Civfan	2014-05-11	dude I can't remember a thing that happened before the trial so I just gave it a 10

Â 
She ran away from giant,vicious dogs and armed men after realizing her brother had become a shell of himself. Not well executed but she didn't exactly run from just dogs.
117	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-05-11	. Also a boat from Pyke to Dreadfort? Seriously?Â 


Â 
'Yara' says at the end of S3 she was going to sail around the entire continent 'all the way up the Narrow Sea' to get to the Dreadfort. It was the reason so many were 'adamant' that Melisandre would be giving her 'there is only one hell' line to Yara instead of the far more obvious Shireen.

It didn't make sense then either. Sometimes stuff just will not fit in my brane and that's one.  I know Theon was more familiar with the concept of walking on land than Ashs but still...

Â 
Oh I agree. Much easier to raid the Dreadfort from Moat Cailin. The whole story was very weak, but they did establish that sailing from Pyke to near the Dreadfort was do-able, which it is.
123	Buzzard16	2014-05-11	The Trial and Peter Dinklage owned this episode. The rest was very disjointed. Yara / Ramsey? What the hell was that? The Trial's execution and incredible acting saved this episode. I gave this one an 8 for Peter alone, as bad as the rest of the episode was, he was just that good.
124	Mr Smith	2014-05-11	Was hovering around 8-9 for most of the episode. Raid at the Dreadfort felt very rushed, but I could see what they were trying to do, so points for effort. But then a man called Peter Dinklage came along...
Â 
10. Absolutely a 10. Is that what you want to hear?
Â 
  Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â Â

I literally don't have any more words right now.
125	shyndy	2014-05-11	if it weren't for the messed up end of the yara/ theon scene it would have been a great episode, otherwise I give it an 8

I'm deep into Season 7 of a 24 marathon and that scene put me right back in JackWorld for a moment.
127	Merysa Serrett	2014-05-11	Didn't like the Asha scene. However, Alfie Allen - good gods, he is nailing it as Reek. That made the whole weirdness kind of worth it.Â 
Â 
Everything else was fantastic. Even Emilia Clarke was mostly watchable. I smirked a little when Hizdahr zo Loraq showed up.Â 
Â 
The entire trial and all scenes related were fantastic. Dinklage is a beast. I was actually scared when he went on the tirade at the end. Holy shitsnacks.Â 
Â 
I gave it an 8 - I really didn't like the Asha scene.Â

128	Banner Without Brothers	2014-05-11	I loved the Deradfort scene. I'm not that far into the books so I'm practically a non-book reader at least in terms of what is happening now. It's conclusion was a little disappointing but it was ok. The speech yara gave at the beginning was badassary at it's finest.It established the Iron Born in terms of the show. They've not been given much time until now. It also showed us that they are not just all talk and especially Yara. We get to see why she's such a respected and favoured military leader. (even though she failed) Where the blood on Ramsey came from was not explained, which was a bit weird. But his scene with Reek was good and served to enhance both characters.
Â 
The Iron bank was good. We got to see Stannis outside of his comfort zone which added something new to the character. I love Mark Gatiss epically creepy as always.
Â 
A bit of Oberyn and.... MACE TYRELL GOT SOME LINES!!! OMG FINALLY. All the kings landing stuff before the trial was cool.
Â 
And then the trial. I'm not sure there's too much I can say that hasn't already been said. Great performance.
Â 
I gave the episode a 9
129	shiola	2014-05-11	9. Â The ONLY complaint I have is that the bones presented to Dany were goat bones, not child bones. Â If they show her the bones of the kid in a later episode, I'll go back and give this a 10.
Â 
Otherwise, PERFECT.
130	Ser Blake	2014-05-11	The yara/asha scene is about Reek.Â  It's sole goal was to show that Theon Greyjoy is dead, and with regards to that it was extremely successful.
131	Banner Without Brothers	2014-05-11	Oh yeah and did anyone else notice Cersi referred to Joffery as Joff. First time in the entire show I think?
132	iliasb	2014-05-11	awesome ep, definitely a 10. I have even found yara scene awesome! Strongest episode, especially the trial
Â 
edit: cried for tyrionÂ   Â (and I don't easily cry)
133	lil_z	2014-05-11	The Sceen at dreadfort, as many have mentioned, seemed pointless, they really didn't need it TBH, not after the scene in season 3 were Theon's fathers calls him "no son of mine."
Â 
But Tyrion, at the trial, gave me goose bumps. Well done, very well done, Dinklage shines here, we knew his talent but he lets it all out. His range, and show had me feeling his characters deep seeded injustices.
Â 
Solid 10
134	chicagostatecougars	2014-05-11	Well crafted episode. 8/10
135	3eraven	2014-05-11	Loved the trail. Very well written. Loved Dinklage' snd Nikolaj' performance
136	IlAovatar	2014-05-11	4/10
Â 
- Yara's assault was just plain bad. Underwhelming. Hated how they turned Ramsay into a "badass" fighter.Â 
- Iron bank of Braavos was a disappointment despite a decent performance (as usual) from Liam Cunningham.
- The dialogue between Daenerys and Hizdahr zo Loraq was some of the worst acting i've seen in the entire series.
- The constant reminders about Oberyn's sexuality were cringeworthy. Far worse than previous episodes. It's just getting embarrassing now.
Â 
- The trial itself was okay. Nothing exceptional, but not particularly disappointing. Sibel Kekilli once again proved that she's not a good actress.
Â 
Overall, one of the most disappointing episodes I can remember. Something about it just rubbed me the wrong way.

That trial though . . .
Â 
The only time the show has ever given me goosebumps. Peter Dinklage nailed it. Nailed it. The score building in the background, the final face off of Tywin and Tyrion and Tywin's realization that his pact with Jamie is now borked . . . Fantastic

Like I said. The Reek specific stuff was good, i.e. showing how far he is gone. But the stuff leading up to it and following it is nonsensical. They should have gone for something other than a commando raid on the Dreadfort.that ends when Ramsay threatens them with ....  dogs
140	3eraven	2014-05-11	4/10
- The dialogue between Daenerys and Hizdahr zo Loraq was some of the worst acting i've seen in the entire series.


I beg to differ on this. I thought Emilia potrayed the guilt of crusifying a non-evil master rather perfectly. It was as subtle as it needed to be.
141	DogLover	2014-05-11	8/10, mostly for the trial. Asha's little trip was a baffling waste of time, but Christ... that trial. Even Jaime's early role in it fit perfectly.

My sentiment exactly.
142	Lady Beyond the Wall	2014-05-11	Rated a 9! Nothing felt rushed, the trial and Kings Landing scenes were revealing, especially hinting on the mystery that is. Varys. Yara is a terrible name choice for Asha, but what's done is done. I had forgotten her name was changed until she said it.
143	The Great Unwashed	2014-05-11	This was definitely my favorite episode of the season thus far. Â The trial was amazing, I loved the Davos scene in Braavos, Drogon looked badass and even most of the filler stuff and deviations from the book were well done (I loved the deviation with Hizdahr). Â I gave it an 8, entirely because of the clumsy way the Asha storyline was handled...although the aftermath scene with Ramsey and Reek and the bath was great.
144	Nordeast	2014-05-11	Loved this episode. Â Tyrion will make a worthy competitor for best actor going against Walter White, and Rust Cole.
Â 
The Asha part was stupid. Â So she was cornered and Ramsey just lets her go? Â How did she get out of the dungeon? Â Sometimes when D and D need to add a scene it seems like they don't know how to make the scene realistic.
Â 
Still gave it a 9 because watching Shae burn Tyrion was perfect and basically how I pictured it.
145	Maxarion	2014-05-11	Dinklage is so good...
An Emmy for Dinklage !
Â
146	TheHouseHB	2014-05-11	Only reason I gave it an 8 is because of the Yara plot line. Other than that the episode was great loved the end credits.
147	redriver	2014-05-11	I'm giving this a 9.5 and I haven't seen it yet.I trust you guys so much.
148	The Dragon Demands	2014-05-11	Pretty much the only weak part of the episode was the ironborn attack on the Dreadfort. Â Actually, it wasn't that badly written in terms of dialogue, the pacing/cinematography was okay, the acting great all around. Â Just that the *basic idea* of it was pure filler and didn't really amount to anything. Â I say this as a book fan: Â TV-first fans I know were confused at how much hype they gave to Yara Greyjoy in the Season 3 finale. Â And how the heck did they circumnavigate Westeros to the Dreadfort? Â But again, good writing managed to smooth it in fairly well, it wasn't even "weak" so much as just "not strong", sort of just there. Â 
Other minor complaints on an otherwise solid 9 of an episode:
First, I wish that at least one of the Braavosi bankers was black, to emphasize how much of a melting pot Braavos is.
Second...maybe this was due to time constraints so I sympathize, but when Hizdahr pleaded that he be allowed to give his father a proper burial...I *really* wish that after he left, Barristan leaned in to Daenerys and said he felt she made the right decision, by pointing out to her that even Robert "The Usurper" Baratheon, who killed her brother Rhaegar at the Trident, afterwards Barristan and other captured Targaryen loyalists pleaded that Robert allow Rhaegar to be given a proper funeral (by cremation, as per Valyrian custom) and that even Robert relented and allowed them to do so. Â That would have tied in very well. Â Though again, maybe it was time constraints. Â
149	Sun	2014-05-11	A 8Â for the King's Landing scenes!Â 
Â 
For Dinklage, Dinklage, Dinklage, and Coster-Waldau. For them and because of them this episode rises to one of the best of the season.Â 
Â 
There's an Emmy for Dinklage in this episode I suspect.Â

150	Seneti	2014-05-11	10 - can't think of a single thing I didn't like
151	The Dragon Demands	2014-05-11	In all fairness I didn't take it as "the ironborn are scared off by dogs" but that Yara had already lost several men, the garrison was waking up, and specifically in that room, Ramsay wasn't outnumbered because he could let loose the dogs...who would attack *in addition to* his remaining soldiers in the room, turning the odds against Yara. Â Chances diminishing fast, she chose to retreat while she could. Â 
Yeah...visually maybe some viewers would jump to "haha they're scared by hunting dogs" but even I, who didn't like the subplot, just saw it as "concentration of force, turning the numbers against the dwindling ironborn raiding party". Â
152	Goldfinger	2014-05-11	The last 5 minutes...great.
153	ladyinblack	2014-05-12	Really trying not to compare to the books anymore
I enjoyed this ep -gave my first 9
The casting & acting was superb
That being said Asha/Yara is terrible in the part . Tonight she gave a good effort on logistically ridiculous raid on the Dreadfort.?
Dinklage killed it & Oberyn is brillantly played.
Why are they -Stannis & Davos at the IB..? It's way early. Guess they need winter clothes...& ships

Â 
- Yara's assault was just plain bad. Underwhelming. Hated how they turned Ramsay into a "badass" fighter.Â 
- Iron bank of Braavos was a disappointment despite a decent performance (as usual) from Liam Cunningham.
- The dialogue between Daenerys and Hizdahr zo Loraq was some of the worst acting i've seen in the entire series.
- The constant reminders about Oberyn's sexuality were cringeworthy. Far worse than previous episodes. It's just getting embarrassing now.
Â 
- The trial itself was okay. Nothing exceptional, but not particularly disappointing. Sibel Kekilli once again proved that she's not a good actress.
Â 
Overall, one of the most disappointing episodes I can remember. Something about it just rubbed me the wrong way.
Quoted because WOW!
155	shiola	2014-05-12	The yara/asha scene is about Reek.Â  It's sole goal was to show that Theon Greyjoy is dead, and with regards to that it was extremely successful.


 
Glad to see other people picking up on this
156	edgeroc	2014-05-12	One of my favorite of the season. I give it an 8, and the only reason it is not a 10 is the total afterthought Dreadfort scene.Â 
Â 
I'm sorry, the whole scene at the Dread was hot garbage. It felt like they added the montage at the end of season 3 with Yara coming for Theon and the whole thing was over in a few minutes. I understand, Theon has stockholm in the worst way but the buildup just to show us how bad he had stockholm was just terrible. The last scene with Yara saying her brother was already dead just sealed it for me. In my opinion the worst buildup to a scene in the story ever, I felt like I was watching something totally different. I'm going to move on but words can't explain how terrible that whole scene was to me. I actually wish they would have just left that out altogether.
Â 
Everything else in the episode minus that was a 10. The scene with the dragon ascending in Mareen, totally awesome.
Â 
Dany figuring out just what it takes to rule over thousands of people, awesome.
Â 
Stannis and Davos in Bravos, totally awesome.
Â 
The trial scene, totally awesome. Not worried at all because as much as they kill characters in this show I don't fathom any way possible they will kill off the best actor and best character in it, period.
Â 
This would be the best episode of the season for me if not for the first 10 minutes.
157	yushkevitch	2014-05-12	I gave it a 9 based mostly on the trial. I think it was masterfully done, the rising drama, Tyrion snapping and of course the final "twist" of him asking for a trial by combat. Powerful stuff.
Â 
The raid buildup was well done (didn't we almost forget about Yara) and although I confess I wasn't a fan of Alfie Allen's Theon, or early Reek, he was brilliant this episode. Great acting.
Â 
But ... for some reason something occurred to me watching Cersei. Does she really believe Tyrion did it or is he just her scapegoat? I ask because unless she truly believe he is guilty I would think a mother who loved her children (even Joffrey) as much as she did would not rest until the real murderer was found?
158	FalseKnight	2014-05-12	Glad to see other people picking up on this

I don't know how else people expected them to do this.
159	Mr Hodor	2014-05-12	Except for the unnecessary Yara part, soild 9.
160	Alboin	2014-05-12	Stupid "Yara" save is the only downside of the episode I can think of.Â 
Â 
Amazing.
161	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-05-12	9.5
Â 
Definitely the best episode this season thus far.

Â 
I think she truly believes that Tyrion is guilty. we see that in her POV's in affc.
163	WatcherInTheNight	2014-05-12	I thought Yara's rescue was stupid the whole time. It's clearly filler to get them to next season and then introduce aFFC material on the Greyjoys with a full season. Shouldn't Ramsey and Reek be close to Moat Cailin by now? After the meeting with Roose, Locke had enough time to travel to Castle Black, train, join the NW, travel to Crasters, scout Crasters, and die. Ramsey has just been banging his hot friend this whole time!?!?!?!?
164	Dragonglass Order	2014-05-12	I give it a 9. Â I wish I could give it a 10 for the second half alone, but I wasn't crazy about the first half.
Â 
The entire trial was amazing. Â When Shae walked in, I must admit, I started to cry. Â And I love Oberyn. Â Too bad we won't be seeing him much longer.
Â 
Peter Dinklage absolutely killed it! Get this man another Emmy!Â
165	Hodor's Dragon	2014-05-12	Dinklage = Emmy. Â You saw it happen tonight.
166	Jabronius Maximus	2014-05-12	9. Dinklage nailed it.
167	superdeluxe	2014-05-12	They completely nailed the trial.Â  Best episode of season for me.
168	Florina Laufeyson	2014-05-12	8. was originally a 7.5 cuz the goat put my jimmies out of place. But after some straightening out of said jimmies and the realization we might get the burned child later, its an 8. Peter Dinklage was solid and i love the rise of Dark Tyrion. Alfie kicked ass as Theon being in full Reek mode.Â
169	Stark11	2014-05-12	Loved this episode. Â Tyrion will make a worthy competitor for best actor going against Walter White, and Rust Cole.
Â 
The Asha part was stupid. Â So she was cornered and Ramsey just lets her go? Â How did she get out of the dungeon? Â Sometimes when D and D need to add a scene it seems like they don't know how to make the scene realistic.
Â 
Still gave it a 9 because watching Shae burn Tyrion was perfect and basically how I pictured it.Will True Detective be in the same category as Game of Thrones? I always thought American Horror Story was in a different category then a regular TV series. TD and AHS are borth anthologies... If not though  Dinklage is gonna have a tough time beating out McCanaughey even with that performance..
2nd, Ramsey likes to play games, why not let the hounds go and chase after them? I understand where you're coming from though.
I give it a 9.5. Best episode of the season so far.
EDIT: looked up Emmy's from last year, pretty positive True Detective will be put in the mini-series category. That hopefully equals a Emmy for Mr. Dinklage

170	The Blue Hysteria	2014-05-12	I loved the episode. Gave it a 10.
Didn't have a big gripe with the Yara scene like so many people on the forum seem to. Â Thought the action was excellent and for the first time in the show Theon truly felt like Reek to me. Â 
The only thing I felt was lacking was more dialogue from Stannis in the Bravos scene. Â Seemed like he gave up to early and just expected Davos to do everything!! I guess that's not too far off... Would just like to see him displayed as Â a stronger leader.
171	Bluecore	2014-05-12	4/10

Â

Â 
I agree that they're making an un necessarily huge deal out of Oberyn's sexuality. Reminds me of the BFD they're making about the homosexual who was picked in the NFL draft. However, HBO has been doing this for a while (I'm thinking of Omar from the Wire to start).Â 
Â 
The whole Dreadfort scene up until the retreat was dumb. She made this great speech, and then we got 3 minutes of fighting and then they had to bounce. Ramsey had two small daggers and no armor on, and him and a handful of his people took on the "best reavers in the Iron Islands" and made them retreat. For God's sake, they were fully equipped and even had shields. Theon's acting was good though, you could really get the impression he was a broken man.Â 
Â 
I was also under the impression that Braavosi's were more, for lack of a better term, "foreign" in the books. The representatives for the Iron Bank reminded me of 21st century Swiss bankers or something, lol. Mildly disappointing but not a huge deal. I've learned to accept the fact that Charles Dance has hair.Â 
Â 
The actor who played Shae used to do porn. Wasn't expecting much.Â 
Â 
I disagree about the trial, I think it was done really well.Â
172	Kenyatta	2014-05-12	The trial was probably the best single scene in the entire series.Â  They freaking nailed it.Â  Honestly I may have gotten more emotional and more chills at the trial than I did during the Red Wedding.Â Â  Peter DInklage just locked up his Emmy.


Â 
I agree that Dinklage was awesome this episode. We haven't seen this Tyrion since season one but this Emmy was locked up months ago by Matthew McConaughey in True Detective.
173	Adhara	2014-05-12	9
Â 
Peter Dinklage:Â Blew me away.
He seemed to transform. His facial structureÂ morphing as his hatred spewed.
Excellent.
Â 
Asha:Â  Really? The most sadistic sac of balls on television let a Greyjoy go?
And a female, at that. One of his favorite things to torture and kill.
End of that scene really took me out of the moment.?
Â 
Shae:Â  A woman scorned, or scratching to save her own skin.
Which-ever it was, she's toast..
Â 
Tywin: Â tyloser, very soon.
Looking forward to watching him get turned into a Ka-bob.
Â 
Dany:Â Come early, stay late. Just another day at the office.
Â 
Fun episode!

Peter doesn't need to compete with Matthew McConaughey because TD is a miniseries. Peter doesn't need to compete with Bryan Cranston because he would be submitted as a Supporting Actor. I'd say Peter has this one in the bag, if the gods are just.
176	Ryuho Martell	2014-05-12	A 10 for me, despite Asha's scene.
177	The brown snake	2014-05-12	Disopointed in Yarra/ Asha she came half way across the world to leave empty handed!
178	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-05-12	Positive
Braavos.Iron Bank - quite well done I thought. Re-established the importance of Stannis and Davos after being cast adrift for so long. Good hint about how savvy the IBB is too
'Yara' on ship - great but the drama of the scene was lost a bit following the comedy of Saan.
Reek/Ramsay - fantastic but again tainted by the disjointed flow of drama from the preceding scene
Hizdahr - Nailed it (oops, was that too soon?)
Small Council Meeting - One of the better SCMs they have portrayed. No musical chairs alone was a big plus.
The Trial - Possibly the greatest scene they have yet produced.
Â 
Negative
Attack on the Dreadfort - Pointless, disappointing, rushed, underdeveloped, underwhelming, terrible (Alfie's acting notwithstanding)
Â 
Neutral
Salad Sandwich - Saan was what saved this scene from being a negative.
Meereen - Dragon business: OK - the Drogon appearance alone should be a +ve, but the resolution was more taken up by the titles. The titles were longer than the attack on the Dreadfort.
Varys/Oberyn - OK but just seemed to be missing an X factor. Enough to get people to ask a lot of questions were it not overwhelmed by later scenes.
Â 
I'd love to give it a 9 but I think it isn't quite there. I'll put an 8 on it but that actually means '8.5'. I suspect I will edit this upwards later though.
179	TheEvilKing	2014-05-12	Gave it an 8.
Â 
The Stannis and Ramsay scenes were alright. Hizdahr's already completely different to the books and more likeable than Daario, it will be interesting to see how that develops.
Â 
All the KL scenes were great. The second half of the trial was immensely good.
Â 
Was this the first ever episode with no children of Ned Stark?
180	Knight of Ashes	2014-05-12	9. Haven't really liked an ep in quite a while but this does a great job of making up for it.
					
					
							Edited by Knight of Ashes, 12 May 2014 - 02:18 AM.
181	Bungholes First	2014-05-12	I thought it was a perfect episode. It's up there with The Rains of Castamere, Blackwater, Baelor, and A Golden Crown.
Â 
In the previous season the Dreadfort plot was the weakest part of the season. Every time it came up, it was a chore to watch and I felt more tortured than poor Reek. This season they are among the best, and I feel tense and shocked when it comes on screen. Psychological torture is much more disturbing than pain and gore.
182	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-05-12	A solid 7.Â 
Positives:Â 
The trial was brilliant.Â 
The Drogon scene. The CGI is top notch.
Hizzy!
Small council meeting finally.
Negatives:
Â 
Hypocritical usurper queen of meereen, blah blah, more Dany bs.Â 
Varys and Oberyn pep talk.
Meh:
Â 
Stannis and IB scene, was so looking forward to it but nope another average Stannis scene.
183	The Drunkard	2014-05-12	Gave it an 8. Probably my favourite since the first episode.
184	Queen of Whores	2014-05-12	I gave it a 6. The last scene was fantastic, and Peter Dinklage really brought the intensity to the scene. My favourite scene of the season so far. The rest of the episode was pretty crap honestly. I was very disappointed by the Braavos scene with Tycho, and I expected it to be more memorable. Kind of pissed off Stannis said like three sentences, but whatever, at least he wasn't burning infidels. The Dany scene was as exciting as cardboard, and just as flat. So what's up with the goatheard? Are we still getting whatÂ reallyÂ happened in the books, or is this it? Pretty good they had Hizdahr call Dany out on crucifying an innocent man. That was pretty lol-worthy, just to shove it in the faces of Dany fanatics. And I guess Yara's whole trip was entirely pointless then? Ummm... okay then. That's done now....
Â 
If it wasn't for the trial at the end I would have given this episode a 5. For once the King's Landing scenes actually made an episode better. Still, I'm very disappointed in this episode. I expected to be a lot more entertained and interested, and it just felt very flat and lifeless, like everyone was just going through the motions, wanting to get it all wrapped up. The episode - and the show as well now - has been missing a certain 'spark' it had in the dialogue and pacing that the show used to have.
185	Emperoreddy	2014-05-12	8 as I wish it was longer and the dreadfort fight just felt pointless.
Â 
Even if you argue successfully she left for strategic reasons and not the dogs (how she got out if thats true boggles me too) right now it makes no sense to have sent her all the way there just to leave that quickly. Worst part is the fight itself was pretty entertaining, her speech before hand was excellent, Ramsay was his normal awesome crazy self, and the aftermath bath scene was twisted and excellent. Some of the best Reek stuff we have gotten yet. Was just the escape and the whole point of this that detracts.
Â 
Literally everything else was spot on. One of the better Dany scenes, and nice to see her knocked down a peg. I liked the Braavos scene and Davos once again proves why he is the best. Small Council was great, Oberyn continues to just win in every scene he is in.
Â 
Finally of course the highlight is the trial. Entire scene was perfectly crafted. Some of the most interesting shots of the throne room yet. The score was spot on, and the acting was above and beyond. Some of the best the show has done. Tyrion's confession really should be one of those scenes that transcends the show and goes into the mainstream memory.
186	Newstar	2014-05-12	Direction in this episode was on point, although in general I've been really impressed with the directing in Season 4.
187	Conchobar	2014-05-12	Very nice episode, they need to work on fight scenes though, something just doesn't feel right about them. I don't know what it is either, you don't know who is who, who is dying, what is happening.
Â 
I enjoyed the scene because of what it meant for Reek though. And obviously the trial scene was flawless.
Â 



Â 
Stannis and IB scene, was so looking forward to it but nope another average Stannis scene.

Â 


Every Stannis scene is average to you, even if it is quite good, like this one was.

188	Missandei2	2014-05-12	I gave it a 9.Â  No matter what else happened in the episode, Tyrion's trial was amazing and heart-braking.Â Â  And OMG, the sheer mad passion of anger that Dinklage was able to portray at the end of the episode was nothing short of brilliant!
189	Modesty Lannister	2014-05-12	A perfect 10. All the right ingredients were there. All the bits that are off books were excellent.
- Braavos seq impressive and Davos excellent
- Jaime bargaining super
- Oberyn and Varys exchange informative
- Asha at Dreadfort excellent, because it gives us insight into how damaged Reek actually is. Unlike the books, we cannot hear his thoughts in the show. This was a necessary addition prior to Moat Cailin seq
Â 
- Tyrion trial was spot on.Â 
- Even Deanarys seq worked, which didn't happen for a while
Â 
All in all, it felt like the episode was 10 minutes long. Kudos to Alik Sakharov for a superb direction. The acting crew is always superb, but it doesn't hurt to mention how great they are.
190	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-05-12	Every Stannis scene is average to you, even if it is quite good, like this one was. 


Not really, I really liked the ship back in second season Episode 8 and ofcourse blackwater.Â 
Season 3 was downright pathetic and season 4 has been that way as well.Â
191	Ran	2014-05-12	Seems quite harsh to dock the entire episode a point because of 1-2 minutes of a 50ish minute episode.


Â 
From start to finish, the ironborn excursion was about 5 minutes long, 10% of the episode, FWIW. 10x.1=1.
Â 
And let me tally up: 297 votes, 8.79 average, 9 median, 8.96 normalized average.

					
					
							Edited by Ran, 12 May 2014 - 03:22 AM.
192	Lord of Winterhell	2014-05-12	Best. Episode. Ever.
Â 
don't know what else to say right now
193	ground_control	2014-05-12	4 of 10 -- well, at least it's been all uphill since episode 4...
Â 
o Sailing into Braavos / Iron Bank -- awesome.
Â 
o Asha/Yara -- not sure why they wasted time having her read the letter to the Ironborn just before arriving instead of a "previously on GOT..." before the opening credits, but whatever. Â The combat portion, like last week's at Craster's, was truly abominable. Â Seriously -- when Asha/Yara gave the Pulp Fiction hardest pipe-hitting Ironborn speech at the end of Season 3, I was expecting to see them getting literally medieval on the Boltons. Â Instead, it's like, "no harm, no foul, you keep Theon, we'll just put our tails between our legs and sail all the way back around Westeros, see you next season."
Â 
o Mereen -- cheesy CGI, not sure why they showed human remains when it looked like it was supposed to be just goats *this time* to set up for it being a child next time...but I totally lost respect for the show with the whole Hizdar revisionist history thing. Â I understand the writer for this episode may need the money, but if he/she really hates Martin and the books that much, he'she should just get another job. Â Seriously, in the books, the slavers themselves choose who gets executed, and there is no indication that *any* of them opposed crucifying the children. Â This antifanfic is worse than Talisa + Shae + episode 4/5 Crasters.
Â 
o Small Council / Varys+Oberyn -- not sure how Tywin demoting Mace to "ink boy" fits with his attitude last episode (saying how much they need the Tyrells). Â It's like the writers don't talk to each other or read/watch each other's episodes. Â Also, Mace is a buffoon, not a retard, so I fail to see him not noticing that Tywin is treating him poorly. Â Also, WTF -- did Pycelle actually say, "Jesus Christ" after Varys talks about The Hand? Â I know the writers have been sloppy with words this Season ("all the rage", etc.), but that's pretty bad.
Â 
o The Trial -- pretty awesome. Â Too bad whoever wrote this part didn't write (or spend as much time) on the rest of the episode.
Â 
Again, it would be nice if we could vote/poll on a per-scene basis, I hate the fact that a 10+ scene like the trial has to get buried by 1- scenes like the Dreadfort and Mereen.
194	OnlyOne	2014-05-12	I like it. Specially Stannis scene for a change. 
The trial was done nicely.
However I wont give it the highest grade because the Asha-Ramsey scene sucked as hell. Im so tired of the "almost reunion" pointless scenes. Done many times with Starks and now with Greyjoys.
Its a 7 for me.

Agreed
195	Ser Shaft of Hightower	2014-05-12	the 2nd half of this was great
the first half not so much
Â 
this 'Yara' person is ponderous and i really miss the Real Asha; one of the best characters in the books has the personality of a burlap sack on TV. well, a steely sack. but still, a sack.
Â 
and ramsay is not supposed to be fun. twisted, yes, but gleeful - NOT. missing the mark by a wide mile, there. Ramsey is basically Glen Danzig-meets-Alan Rickman but we're getting one of the Oasis brothers instead.
Â 
the trial was on point!
Â 
6.5
196	Alboin	2014-05-12	Not a lot of people are openly giving credit to Nikolaj Coster Waldau in this episode (which is understandable in the light of Dinklage's acting). Whole Nikolaj performance tonight was incredible: Jaime's shuttle diplomacy and then, at the trial - hisÂ disillusion on father's justice andÂ unease on what's coming - and a lot of Â that played just by silent looks... Brilliant work!
197	OnlyOne	2014-05-12	4 of 10 -- well, at least it's been all uphill since episode 4...
Â 
o Sailing into Braavos / Iron Bank -- awesome.
Â 
o Asha/Yara -- not sure why they wasted time having her read the letter to the Ironborn just before arriving instead of a "previously on GOT..." before the opening credits, but whatever. Â The combat portion, like last week's at Craster's, was truly abominable. Â Seriously -- when Asha/Yara gave the Pulp Fiction hardest pipe-hitting Ironborn speech at the end of Season 3, I was expecting to see them getting literally medieval on the Boltons. Â Instead, it's like, "no harm, no foul, you keep Theon, we'll just put our tails between our legs and sail all the way back around Westeros, see you next season."
Â 
o Mereen -- cheesy CGI, not sure why they showed human remains when it looked like it was supposed to be just goats *this time* to set up for it being a child next time...but I totally lost respect for the show with the whole Hizdar revisionist history thing. Â I understand the writer for this episode may need the money, but if he/she really hates Martin and the books that much, he'she should just get another job. Â Seriously, in the books, the slavers themselves choose who gets executed, and there is no indication that *any* of them opposed crucifying the children. Â This antifanfic is worse than Talisa + Shae + episode 4/5 Crasters.
Â 
o Small Council / Varys+Oberyn -- not sure how Tywin demoting Mace to "ink boy" fits with his attitude last episode (saying how much they need the Tyrells). Â It's like the writers don't talk to each other or read/watch each other's episodes. Â Also, Mace is a buffoon, not a retard, so I fail to see him not noticing that Tywin is treating him poorly. Â Also, WTF -- did Pycelle actually say, "Jesus Christ" after Varys talks about The Hand? Â I know the writers have been sloppy with words this Season ("all the rage", etc.), but that's pretty bad.
Â 
o The Trial -- pretty awesome. Â Too bad whoever wrote this part didn't write (or spend as much time) on the rest of the episode.
Â 
Again, it would be nice if we could vote/poll on a per-scene basis, I hate the fact that a 10+ scene like the trial has to get buried by 1- scenes like the Dreadfort and Mereen.

Asha/Yara and Ramsey was a waste of film. He will remember her next time. Lol
198	OnlyOne	2014-05-12	Iron Bank aka mob backs Stannis only via Davos. I guess he is earning his title. 
The first part of the trial was great-now to see the mountain and Oberyn. 
Mereen was off base completely-do the writers even know what's going on?
Disappointing.
199	Frey Pies	2014-05-12	The third best episode the show has ever done. The guilty of being a dwarf speech was perhaps the greatest thing I've seen on TV. Every single storyline was good!
Â 
Â 
This is an episode that deserves more than a 10.
200	yushkevitch	2014-05-12	Dinklage = Emmy. Â You saw it happen tonight.


Â 
He was brilliant as usual but I don't see an Emmy for him unfortunately - at least not this year. He'll likely be the sentimental favourite (no, not because of *that* .. okay, a little because of that, rather due to Tyrion being such a tragic and insanely popular character) but if the voters look past that they'll certainly agree the award belongs to McConaughey..
201	King Tyrion I	2014-05-12	10/10
Â 
Everything was perfect.
Â 
My namesakes (in a double way) nail it. Every bit of it.
Â 
Asha/Ramsay/Reek.
Â 
That was awesome acting. Especially Alfie and Iwan.
Â 
Varys and Oberyn rock.
Â 
It was actually the first episode I liked Stannis. But Davos and Salladhor'Saan get the credit.

Agreed. Dinklage was great in this episode, but he's been somewhat unremarkable the past five episodes (not really his fault; the writing's been a bit off). While he deserves a nomination at least, there is no way McConaughey doesn't win the Emmy. His monologue in 1x2 about his daughter actually almost brought me to tears, and nothing I watch ever does. One could pick any scene with McConaughey in it and present that to the Emmy's.
203	BorhPT	2014-05-12	i give it a 9 only for Peter Dinklage. He stole this episode, what an actor!!!!
204	kidlatxo	2014-05-12	I enjoyed this episode. I feel that the episode had a nice flow to it. Viewers see the ties from the beginning of the season, plans are coming to fruition ie Stannis/Davos. I really enjoyed the Iron Bank scenes. I'm sure it gave Stannis more street cred from some of the Unsullied viewers.
Ramsey, Reek, and Yara scenes I also enjoyed. I believe that to say it is pointless is a bit of an exaggeration. I can agree Ramsay/naked girl scene was silly but I enjoy the actor who plays Ramsay so... But they did convey Reek's loyalty as well as his mental state. I think it's a good stepping stone to where the show plans to go in the next episodes. Obviously they can't leave us hanging on Reek's story.
Danny's scenes were great. The throne is a bit more than she bargained for. The dragon looked amazing. The flow of the scene was nice. I didn't know what was about to happen and then Drogon came up out of now where.
Tyrion's trial was absolutely riveting. I loved the acting. It was spot on. I was so emotional. The ups and the downs. I could go on.
I gave this episode a ten. I was very satisfied with it.

I think you read the book, but I'm wondering why you didn't expect the drogon scene? It was obvious soon as the kid was shown.
205	Frey Pies	2014-05-12	Agreed. Dinklage was great in this episode, but he's been somewhat unremarkable the past five episodes (not really his fault; the writing's been a bit off).

Â 
McConaughey= best actor emmy (and hopefully oscar for Interstellar!)
Dinklage= best supporting actor
Â 
The two can coexist.
206	The Anti-Targ	2014-05-12	Couple of huh? moments but otherwise very good. 8/10.
207	Mexal	2014-05-12	Loved it. Definite 10 for me. Trial at the end was excellent as was the Reek/Braavos scenes. Not really sure why everyone thinks the Yara scene was pointless. I thought it showed how far Theon has gone, officially kills Theon in Yara's mind for any future scenes on the Iron Islands which we know will happen and becomes the pre-req to the future scene where Reek impersonates Theon. We needed to see his reaction to someone from his old life before we see him go to Moat Cailin and pretend to be Theon. This episode's scene will make that scene all that more powerful.
Â 
As for Yara running from dogs, think it was pretty clear Theon was dead to her and her mission failed so why not get out? I get it's a bit anti climatic but it's not really all that important how they get out, just what happened when she tried to take him out and the subsequent scene between Reek and Ramsey.
208	Ran	2014-05-12	322 votes, 8.78 average, 9 median, 8.95 normalized average.
209	Queen of Whores	2014-05-12	So does anyone think we'll see Yara (I refuse to call her Asha, cause she isn't the same person) again this season, or was this it? Will we maybe see her pass through Moat Cailin or maybe back at Pyke in time for a certain person's death?
210	Ran	2014-05-12	I could see her being in the finale, arriving at Pyke.
211	SnowQueen232	2014-05-12	Not sure if mentioned, but Alfie Allen was amazing. Great acting! 10/10!
212	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-12	Why oh why didn't they finish an excellent trial with Oberyn's declaration? Otherwise very good though I would have added things. 8

Â 
Also, WTF -- did Pycelle actually say, "Jesus Christ" after Varys talks about The Hand? Â I know the writers have been sloppy with words this Season ("all the rage", etc.), but that's pretty bad.
Â 


Â 
No, he said "Disgraceful".
214	gmavridis	2014-05-12	9 for me. The trial scenes were great.
215	gmavridis	2014-05-12	Not sure if mentioned, but Alfie Allen was amazing. Great acting! 10/10!


Â 
I agree he was great.
216	Nictarion	2014-05-12	Why oh why didn't they finish an excellent trial with Oberyn's declaration?I know right?  Would have been a way better ending.
217	igrewupinKL	2014-05-12	Not as great as last episode, but tyrion saved it for me
218	ipsuel	2014-05-12	I gave it a 9/10 (my first 9 of the season). And if I could rate individual performances, I'd give Alfie Allen, Iwan Rheon, NCW and PD all 10/10... My god, IR has just nailed Ramsay and his psycho-ness for me. Such a good casting choice.Â 
Â 
I really have no complaints with the exception of 'Yara' putting her tail between her legs and running... Her and the guys she had with her... Lol, that was just silly and it's the only reason I didn't give it a 10.
Â 
All in all, though, I loved this episode.Â
219	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-12	Granted all the acting was sublime!
220	Modesty Lannister	2014-05-12	I would like to support the poster who complimented Nikolaj's acting. It has been consistently superb throughout the show and I think it is way better than anything Dinklage offered this season. So, if anyone deserves an Emmy nomination, it's Nikolaj.
221	Nictarion	2014-05-12	I would like to support the poster who complimented Nikolaj's acting. It has been consistently superb throughout the show and I think it is way better than anything Dinklage offered this season. So, if anyone deserves an Emmy nomination, it's Nikolaj.Until this episode I would agree, but Dinklage blew everyone away with the last scene with Shae.
222	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-12	NCW should have got an Emmy last season any how. I can't wait for Season 5 when Jaime really comes into his own...
223	Lord Baalish	2014-05-12	Stannis had a new supporter 
IMO, Tyrions speech paled by Davos' tirade to the Iron Bank fella's. Next to that though,Â Lord Tyrell, would you be so kind as to fetch my parchment and quill?
224	Tyrannosaurus	2014-05-12	Trial was perfect. 10. One of the best episodes so far.
225	Waylin Stark	2014-05-12	It's an 8 for me.
Â 
Would have been a 9 if the Theon rescue wasn't so stupid.
And for some reason I was hoping the trial would be dragged out a bit more, but no complaints.
And Peter Dinklage's acting during the trial was PHENOMENAL.
His delivery of the last lines was spectacular.
226	Corwin Jensen	2014-05-12	If I could, I'd give it a 100, but I have to settle for a 10.
227	ladyinblack	2014-05-12	Alfie Allen-  just owning that difficult role always to perfection
Don't know all the actors names-- but Davos is played flawlessly too Stannis is the rightful king
228	Fevre River Warrior	2014-05-12	I thought Tyrion's trial was GREAT, gave the episode a 9 instead of a 10 because the Yara/Asha sequence was such a disappointment. I hope that is not the last we see of her. I would have loved to have seen her kick Ramsey's arse.
Â 
The Titan of Bravos was great and I always love Davos. I think the Mereen portion was slow but in the books it is too....Dany spends way too much time in Mereen but I thought Hizdar was good and liked the twist that his father was one of the crucified men. That sets up what happens later pretty well and gives him a motive.
229	ridilon	2014-05-12	Echoing the sentiments of all. Â Dinklage, Allen, Cunningham, Hill, NCW and as always Dance are superb. Â Not to mention Pascal's delivery with limited lines.
Â 
That was an Emmy winner for PD.
Â 
9/10
230	Fevre River Warrior	2014-05-12	Just had to add - if they follow the books for the next four episodes we are in for some amazing television. I think this season will end up being epic, just like Book 3 (Storm of Swords) is.
231	Mark Antony	2014-05-12	I know right?  Would have been a way better ending.Would make zero sense for him to declare unless he knew The Mountain was the queens champion 
Anyway I give it a 9 best ep of the season

232	Ran	2014-05-12	376 votes in, 8.78 average, 9 median, 8.95 normalized average.
Â 
For those keeping track, this places the episode as the 9th most well-received on the forum, and the best received since "The Rains of Castamere".
233	Jorah the Explorer	2014-05-12	I hate to echo the hivemind here. Â But it was great and I rate it a 9, with the obvious flaw of the Asha scene. Â A dumb sequence that goes in a circle, it's definitely out of place alongside GRRM's pre-Feast writing. Â A new scene that I really enjoyed was the Braavos story, though.. well done Cogman. Â Also the Jaime and Tywin bargain was cool.
234	Daniel Lionsbane	2014-05-12	Was gonna be an 8, but tyrion's speech at the end was just so amazing. Can't wait to see his trial by combat.
235	Nictarion	2014-05-12	Would make zero sense for him to declare unless he knew The Mountain was the queens champion 
Anyway I give it a 9 best ep of the seasonIt would be easy enough for Cersei to name Gregor and then have the last scene be Oberyn stand up and declare for Tyrion.
236	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-05-12	I gave it a 9. This episode was excellent! Â I loved it, even the Dreadfort/Ironborn deviations. Wow! on shirtless Ramsay, I had determined to never find him remotely attractive, but ummm....wow. Â I really like Yara/Asha too. Â The bathtub scene was soooo good and Alfie Allen is just incredible.
Â 
Two Words: Peter Dinklage!
Â 
Oh my goodness, the hairs on my arms were standing up when he gave his speech. Perfection!
Â 
I even finally like the Mereen stuff and loved the way they played Hizdhar, playing him with more layers.Â
237	Mark Antony	2014-05-12	It would be easy enough for Cersei to name Gregor and then have the last scene be Oberyn stand up and declare for Tyrion.
I think they want to reintroduce the Mountain first.
238	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-05-12	I think I would have given the episode a 10 - it was that good, if it wasn't for the unnecessary nudity. It has gotten beyond and old and stupid, even my husband commented on it being unnecessary.
239	BlackTalon	2014-05-12	It is pretty clear that the purpose of the Dreadfort/Yara scene was to drive home that
Â 
1. Theon is truly lost, he is not playacting
2. Yara gets it and she is now free to pursue her other ambitions (Kingsmoot in season 5 yay!)
Â 
Yara's other men were obviously fighting all over the Dreadfort (see blood spatters on ramsay), Ramsay clearly was content with letting her get away, his own casualties would have been to great if he had cornered the Ironborn. Not to mention they were fully armed and armoured, he was shirtless. A man can be excused for being a little cautious in a situation like that

240	Chuck88	2014-05-12	People are making far too much of the Asha sequence. It was poorly handled in the sense that she gave up so easily. The speech beforehand was fantastic. I get why she left Theon, but why the hell not at least kill Ramsay as retribution? Obviously that would have screwed everything up plot-wise, but surely there was a better way to establish why she couldn't.Â 
That said, people writing off the whole plot-line prematurely is pretty frustrating to see. The ironborn plot is advanced ever so slightly now that they know the extent of what's happened to Theon and just how much of a lost cause he is - opening up the plot for the introduction of future characters that some fear might not make the show.Â 
What's more frustrating is that people are letting this, the lack of a Kevan namedrop ruin one of the most dramatic and well-written episodes of the entire show. We finally see the moral ambiguity the show is renowned for find its way into Dany's storyline. Alfie and Iwan were magnificent as always. Not to mention what is probably the best Tyrion scene thus far. There are no words to describe how excellent everything about the last fifteen minutes or so of this episode are.Â

241	Corvinus	2014-05-12	I gave it 8. Maybe it deserves a 9.
What I didn't like about the Asha/Yara was the whole logistics of it. Every episode the intro shows us where storylines are taking place, but they don't seem to care on how a character gets from A to B. How did Asha get from the Iron Islands to the Dreadfort without anyone catching her? Still +1 for her using an axe and not a sword, and we finally got to see some badass ironborn.
I also didn't like Daenerys and Hizdhar much.
The rest was great.

Â 
Ha, this was the only time when I wanted to see the show deviate from the books. One of the ironborn should have totally split Ramsay's skull.
243	Grand Maester Mithrandir	2014-05-12	Straight 9 from me, no doubt. The first two acts were kinda meh but the third act was spectacular. Great performances by Dinklage and NCW.
244	Cyvasse Khal	2014-05-12	8/10 for me. A classic case of an episode building momentum as it goes along culminating in a great ending. By midway through I was getting bummed because it was heading towards another so-so episode, but as soon as King's Landing started things just picked up enormously, and that's no coincidence, the major players and the major acting talents were on full show here.
Â 
Positives
-The Titan: We already saw it in the trailers, but that didn't make it any less impressive and a great scenic shot of Braavos gives us a sneak peak before spending more time there next season.
-Drogon: Wow. Awesome.
-Meereen/Hizdahr: First time this season I have included Meereen in the positives. I loved how it played out. Showed Dany can make the easy decisions like repaying lost goats, but flounders when it comes to dealing with more complicated matters. The actor that played Hizdahr(apologies I don't know him) was terrific, his delivery of good written dialogue was very good.
-Small Council: Every character got to have a little say here and all of it was important stuff acted brilliantly. This episode made me realise I had missed seeing more of Varys this season.
-The Trial: Perfect. I loved every second of it. Once again every character was just highlighted, everybody was seen to be important, the exchanges between all the characters were fantastic.
-Tyrion: Special mention to Peter Dinklage. Time and time again he just proves when he needs to step up and knock a scene out of the park, he does it. His scathing address to the citizens of KL is definitely up there in my favourite moments.
Â 
Negatives
-Iron Bank: For two reasons. Yet again Stannis has been given pretty shoddy treatment here. He can't persuade the IB but Davos can? Just made him look weak. And we are supposed to believe that the IB(pretty much the most important institution in this world) can just change their minds on a pretty damn important decision where they have already laid out their reasons for declining, but switch based on a somewhat rousing speech from Davos? Really not a fan of how all that played out.
-Filler time nudity: Come on HBO. The Sallador scene was pointless, as was Ramsay's sex scene(that didn't even really feel like a Ramsay thing to show).
-Storm of Dreadfort: Rushed and sloppily done.
-Yara/Asha: Don't think D&D really know how to portray this character, and that mostly comes down to not getting enough screen time for her to be fleshed out more. Her speech to the Iron-born was good, but that sort of contradicted the retreat and regroup decision she makes in the end.

245	The Chequered Raven	2014-05-12	Without the Yara/Dreadford stuff it would be 11 of ten...
Â 
Ser Onion's speech to the bankster - priceless!
Oberyn once again great. I was disappointed about the casting becaus he looked to young and not at all a fearsome fighter for me - but his acting is absolutely great!
Any words necessary about the trial...???
Â 
But what in seven hells happened at the Dreadford?
Some twenty Ironborn Elite-Warriors storming a whole castle at night.
And run from some dogs...
Â 
And Ramsay going into an indoor-fight half barebody without getting hurt - the Ironborn seems to be pussies...
Â 
No! No! No!

246	TheImpThatRides	2014-05-12	I understood the point of the Dreadfort scene, just didn't like how it ended, with the appearance of Yara running from dogs.  
Just my humble opinion, but I think it would have been better if it ended something like
Ramsey steps aside- "you know, you've traveled so far I'd hate for you to leave empty handed.  If there is a man named Theon present he is free to go"
Theon- "No, no I'm Reek.  Reek Reek it rhymes with meek!  I'm your Reek!"
Cut to Yara looking horrified, disgusted, etc and then have the beach scene where she says her brother is dead.  It may be nitpicking but to me that would have been less anti-climactic. Still gave it a 9 overall though.
247	David Selig	2014-05-12	Terrible beginning, but it got much better later on. 8.
248	basilisk312	2014-05-12	solid 10 for me... dinkage deserves some sort of special emmy for his performance, that was as good as i've ever seen
249	Sand11751	2014-05-12	8 out of 10. All eight for Dinklage at the trial, Shae, Jaime's expressions. Maybe a little for Theon too. Poor Theon.
250	Into the Weirwood	2014-05-12	Definitely the best episode of the season so far for me. I agree that it was an outstanding performance from Peter Dinklage.
Wish Reek was more like the books on the physical aspect, but Alfie Allen played the role amazingly and made up for it.

Â 
I like that alternative. It would emphasise the fact Ramsay is always playing with Theon/Reek's mind and how damaged he's become after all he's been through in the bastard's hands. For me, the main flaw in that scene was the way they portrayed the ironborn in the end, really.
252	Ser Graymax	2014-05-12	I almost gave this one a 7 but with the quality of most of the acting just had to bump it to an 8.
Â 
The Ironborn seemed a little rusty and the dragon only roasted and carried off one goat and yet the goatherder claimed he lost everything.Â  Way to triple your herd overnight!
Â 
I can never see Meryn Trant again without thinking Meryn Fuc*ing Trant and he is a fu*k as is Pycelle.
Â 
Tywin just doesnt miss a thing, does he?Â 
Enjoyed Varys as usual and Margaery looked stunning!
Â 
Long as we are talking looks, if we are going to have nudity can we at least have some better looking whores.Â  Most of them this season have been a little sub par, perhaps too close to everyday female reality, and this is a fantasy show.Â  Haha, Just J/K.

254	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-05-12	I wanted to give it an 8 after the weird Yara rescue/retreat scene, but Peter's incredible speech was probably the best Tyrion scene of the entire series, so I had to give it a 9.
255	Pablosplinter	2014-05-12	6 again. The trial was great, but everything was pretty poor. The Asha scene was awful!
256	Ser Lady Nym	2014-05-12	Solid 9. Â While the dreadfort was dreadful, everything else was excellent. Â Ugh, dat trial! Â Time for a rewatch!
Â 
ETA: Even though I'm disappointed with the ironborn/dreadfort stuff, Alfie was great. Â Love seeing him on screen.

258	Robin Of House Hill	2014-05-12	10. Â If Peter Dinklage doesn't get an Emmy for that performance, I'll be disappointed. Â Davos' speech ant the Iron Bank, was excellent. Â The Yara sequence was a bit disappointing, though the portrayal of Reek was excellent.
259	Ser Blake	2014-05-12	Best scenes in the show thus far:
Â 
1) Tyrion's trial
2) Jaime and Brienne's bath
3)Â  Red Wedding
4)Â  Ned Beheading
260	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-12	I think they want to reintroduce the Mountain first.

They had 8 mins to do that though!
261	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-05-12	It was almost as if those 8 minutes were scenes of Yara at the Dreadfort that they cut for whatever reason. It seemed odd that Ramsay just shows up with random blood all over himself and there was no real escape sequence.
262	Tose	2014-05-12	Great Stuff. 10 Points.
Â 
Impeccable acting all around. Cunningham, Dance, Allen, NCW and of course Dinklage were superb.
Â 
With regards to the emmy dicussion:
Â 
Definitely an emmy episode for Dinklage. Who is, like always, going to be in the Supporting Actors Category.btw. True Detective ist going for Drama Series not Mini Series. Hitfix
263	Tywin's bastard	2014-05-12	A lot of great acting in this episode and it feels like it's one of my favorites in the show altogether, especially for not being a climax episode.
Â

Â 
I don't think that scene needed anything more than it had. I like that we don't have to be shown why Ramsay has blood all over himself because we know he's crazy enough to kill the girl he was with, and the point of the scene wasn't really anything about the Ironborn but to show that Theon is perhaps damaged beyond repair as not even his sister could snap him out of it.
264	andurilflameofthewest	2014-05-12	Hi new to this forum  I joined because this episode is so great!!!
Â 
Â Â Â Â Having read the books I wont spoil anything....BUT this was the best this season , probably very slow paced for non readers.
Â Â  I will notÂ give anything away ,Â Â  this episodeÂ is the where a pendulum of sorts starts swingingÂ the other way, for one family in particular....Â Â a turning of the tide of fortune.
 
Â 
Â 
Â
265	A Redeemed Hound	2014-05-12	Gave it a 7. Â The trial was very good. Â Seems like they are going to drag out the trial by combat for a couple of weeks. Â Tyrion's confession was superb. Â Dany's scenes were decent enough. Â Just getting her new Mereen story on track I guess. Â A nice introduction of Hizdar...hopefully they do not change actors 5 times before he really gets involved. Â What was the point of Stannis going to Braavos? Â Dragging out his role before heading north I guess? Â Maybe he needed the loan to pay for more ships and crew to head to the Wall? Â What was the point of Asha's attempt to free Theon? Â And how exactly did she get back to her boats? Â And why would Ramsey allow her (a highborn noble) to leave? Â Super weak and highly sloppy. Â And the show was not even 50 minutes long. Â I was going to give it a 6 but Tyrion's scene was very powerful.
266	Kungsmurfen	2014-05-12	Best episode so far of the season.
267	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-05-12	Gave it a 7. Â The trial was very good. Â Seems like they are going to drag out the trial by combat for a couple of weeks. Â Tyrion's confession was superb.

Â 
Stannis went to Braavos because he has no money. They set it up over 3 episodes.
Â 
Asha escaping was just weird. I really think they needed even a quick scene of them fleeing because the transition was quite poor, and as you pointed out there was plenty of time.
268	Alizard Erebys	2014-05-12	Ok so I give it an 8.
Â 
Right after seeing it I thought I'd go for a well-deserved 9 or 10, but I'm rating the whole episode and not just the last scene.
Â 
Been wanting to see Braavos for a while, not disappointed. Nice talk by Davos who actually reversed the situation.
Â 
The Dreadfort scene was nice! Good to see some fighting and to know how messed-up Theon is now. Yara/Asha running away was only logical, her little commando isn't suppose to bring down House Bolton, but merely to infiltrate. If it wasn't for Theon's transformation she would have succeed.
This scene isn't "pointless" at all, Yara just failed! Her departure in the previous season announced this assault, it's only normal we see it happen.
I would gladly have had the Ironborn be more badass and the transition to fleeing seemed weird but eh... (btw, a trained and starving hound can take down an armed man easily).
+1 for erotic choking of Ramsay.
Â 
Daenerys gets to grow-up again, learning what it is to rule people, interesting development (so far we have avoided the stupid romance of the first episode).
Â 
Very nice dialogs in King's Landing, no need to empathize how awesome the trial was.
Mace Tyrell is very well acted. Getting the essence of the character without much lines.
When Tyrion demands trial by combat, all the actors' faces are awesome, magnificent acting. It's their faces + music that conclude the episode in an awesome way.

269	KuwabaraTheMan	2014-05-12	Definitely the highpoint of the season. The Iron Bank scene was pretty good and the trial was amazing. The attack on the Dreadfort was lame, but all of the Ramsay/Reek scenes were pretty incredible. More than any other episode this one managed to pretty much keep everything up from start to finish. I hope the show can remain around this level for the rest of the way.
270	templar7	2014-05-12	I gave it an 8 if only because the whole Yara plot was utterly pointless.
Â 
The trial was gold though. Emmy nom for this Peter Dinklage for the "confession?" Can we all agree, yes?


Agreed!

Â 
If you liked the Dreadfort stuff and the Mereen stuff I don't see how this episode is only an 8.
272	Lady of the Falls	2014-05-12	total waste of time and use of a episode. They could have did so many other things that were real and true to the story than wasting half a episode on things that didn't happen and didn't even change the course of the story like the night watch scenes what was the point of Jon/Bran scenes if they didnt meet. Loche got killed. Â They could of showed Bran meeting cold hands, but they show a other taking baby to it's lair that never happened in books. Â I think show creators are making story more difficult and confusing. It would be best If guess if i'd never read book to have anything to compare it to.Â
273	Stark11	2014-05-12	I almost gave this one a 7 but with the quality of most of the acting just had to bump it to an 8.
Â 
The Ironborn seemed a little rusty and the dragon only roasted and carried off one sheep and yet the sheepherder claimed he lost everything.Â  Way to triple your flock overnight!

Pretty sure Drogon burned the whole flock, if not like 80% of it.
274	ground_control	2014-05-12	Â 
No, he said "Disgraceful".


That's good, I watched it twice and rewound that scene a few times and couldn't get anything but "Jesus Christ" out of it...maybe Pycelle shouldn't mumble quite as much (I have a hard time making out a lot of what he says most of the time).
275	Alizard Erebys	2014-05-12	Â 
If you liked the Dreadfort stuff and the Mereen stuff I don't see how this episode is only an 8.


Â 
I liked the episode, but didn't get this "OMG" feeling before the trial.
Â 
It's very subjective you know, it can get very little to have me go "omg".Â 
Â 
To do as other poster did: "The episode is worth "7" until the trial, then that becomes an 8"
276	sam90	2014-05-12	I gave a 10 but perhaps that's because I just finished watching the episode and I am still excited about it. I didn't have time to cool down. One of the best, if not the best episode so far in the series. Peter Dinklage's performance in the trial is amazing, so much power that the emotions of Tyrion strike the viewer and left it gaping at the end.
Â 
Everything was good in this episode (if we try to forget that the storyline of the series has sundered in parts from that of the books) from Stannis and the Iron Bank, to the failed attempt to rescue Reek as well as Daenyris' courts and the introduction of Hizdar Zo Loraq in Meeren.
Â 
We've reached the best part of ASOIAF, that is the second half of a A Storm Of Sword. It looks promising.

278	rmholt	2014-05-12	I think you read the book, but I'm wondering why you didn't expect the drogon scene? It was obvious soon as the kid was shown.
Well it surprised me - I thought it was well done. And it's too early to kill a kid. And there are kids everywhere. If there had been sheep instead of goats I might have twigged. I don't think too hard during bc I like to be surprised.

279	rainsofcastamere_	2014-05-12	This is my first 10 this season, the trial scene was masterpiece, really. I loved Charles Dance,Peter and NDW, oh and Oberyn was fantastic also.
280	Hard Hugh	2014-05-12	I feel like the asha/yara storming the dreadfort was sloppy and pointless I don't understand why they ran from two dogs and they were armed. But everything else made up for it I especially liked the whole part with Jamie and tywin.


Â 
I admit this wasn't perfect but I guess it didn't upset me nearly as much as some. I don't think the key was fleeing from the dogs...I think it was that they got Theon...and he refused to go. He wasn't her brother anymore. They didn't have many men. This was suppose to be a smash and grab as is the Iron Born way. Not an occupation. Once it was clear her brother was completely turned...it was time to GTFO.
Â 
Overall i loved the episode. Great setup for Stannis. A little sad more of that speech didnt come from him then from Davos but Davos nailed it.
Â 
The trial was incredible and Dinklige knocked it out of the park, as well as Varys.
Â 
It does leave me scared for where i think they are going with Shea and Tyrion as it seems to be setting up to veer pretty far off the book in an attempt to whitewash their perfect love.

285	gotgrrrl	2014-05-12	So if I break my rating down by "scenes" I get....
Â 
Ramsay/Yara/Theon -- 3, would have been a 1 if not for Reek.Â 
Â 
Dany in Meereen/Goat Scene -- 8 -- I liked it, good foreshadowing of bad things to come with the goat bones and although Hizdahr was not as I imagined, I liked how the scene showed the negative repercussions of Dany's form of "justice".Â 
Â 
Stannis and the Iron Bank -- 6 -- interesting to see inside the Iron Bank but the rationale to fund Stannis made no sense whatsoever.Â  The Salladhor Saan hot tub scene really annoyed me.Â  The joke was too long, didn't get the punch line and just seemed like another excuse of nudity.Â  Stannis is of course nowhere to be found.Â 
Â 
Pre-trial scenes -- 6--. Small councils scene was fine, setting up Dany as a threat even though I didn't get the feeling that they see the dragons as something to worry about (baby dragons), more about her Unsullied and Sellswords. Didn't get the Oberyn and Varys discussion as it seemed to suggest that Varys is angling for the Iron Throne which isn't (wasn't) the case.Â  Oh well.Â 
Â 
Trial -- 9-- pretty awesome but followed the book so no real surprises.Â  I liked how Oberyn actually questions some of the testimony (e.g., what debt did Tyrion want to pay back?).Â  They seem to really emphasize Sansa's role in the poisoning with Shea's testimony and finding the necklace.Â  I suppose that makes her position even more precarious.Â 
Â 
So, final score is a 6.5 (okay I'll give it a 7).Â
286	poggo	2014-05-12	10/10, -1 for the dreadfort filler. So a 9/10 overall. A very very good episode anyway.

288	Jasta11	2014-05-12	-1 for the Dreadfort scenes which ended on a lame note. -0.5 for Stannis the Passive. Rounded up to a very, very good 9. best episode of the season so far.
289	Twatbeards conspiracy	2014-05-12	So happy they kept the trial very close to the books, and loved the Vipers quip "well did you?" Lol six he's only in 1-2 more eps. They made him just as I imagined. Tyrions speach was just as good as the book, I'm guilty of being a dwarf. Still confused how Ramsay got the cuts though.

Â 
Strong performance by a few, especially Peter Dinklage. Certainly things I didn't particularly love about this episode, but solid TV drama. Great stuff in my book.
Â 
I feel like I finally hate "show Cersei", although I've always hated book Cersei. It's nice that the show is finally trying to catch up to Cersei's true fucked up nature.
293	Ser Lawrence	2014-05-12	Gave it a 9.Â  
Â 
The actors crushed it.Â  The Dreadfort stuff may have been scripted or edited on the clunky side, but the rest more than made up for it.
Â 
Love me some Davos, Salladhor, Oberyn, a sprinkling of Tyrells, and all the Lannisters. (As much as I hate all Lannisters in the books, I love watching this group of actors.)
Â 
Peter Dinkage KILLED it.
Â 
(and...the requisite boobs)
294	TheImpThatRides	2014-05-12	I think the key to the goat bone scene was that she paid the goatherd three times what his herd was worth and the look on Barristan's face.  That sets up the dozens of goatherds that will start showing up and will make the scene people may have thought that one was going to be even more dramatic.

This is actually *good* adaptation (not saying *you* disagree, I just thought this was a good post to which to reply). Â In the books, we get Dany's POV recalling the previous (off-page) reports, which works fine in a book. Â The show could have had her discussing it with somebody (Daario in the bath -- gag) before the scene, but I think it works much better to show the first claim (and foreshadow the problem), then later (when people are abusing her generosity) drop the bomb with a child's bones. Â And hopefully the show will at least wait one or two episodes before "resolving" this issue.
Â 
The only problem I had with [this part of] the scene is that (to my untrained eyes) the bones looked like human remains. Â Maybe if there had been a clear goat skull that would have been better.
Â 
It's too bad that too many other scenes in recent episodes have been extra-long attempts to introduce and resolve a plot point in one or two sittings.

297	I love Cersei	2014-05-12	First reaction was a 9, almost forgot about the Ironborn business. So 8 it is.Meereen wasn't too convincing either but still ok.Varys, Oberyn, Tywin and Tyrion were all perfect, as was Davos.Overall, I find the series to be much more interesting again because of the last few episodes.
298	Ravi Seaworth	2014-05-12	The combination of Oberyn, Varys, Tyrion, Jaime, Tywin, Pycelle, Cersei, Jaime, (damnit, the whole Kings Landing), in that trial, as well as in the pre-trial was simply too much acting talent gathered together for it not to bee outstanding, and nothing cheapening it. I wasn't too impressed by the Dreadfort, not because of the acting nor the argument, but how it was executed. Not bad, just not nearly as good as the rest of the episode. Everything else was good, except the trial reached an unseen level.
299	RadoLukacs	2014-05-12	8/10.
Peter Dinklage was just outstanding. The whole trial was done very well, I think and it flowed nicely, with staying true to the book. This is what the episode meant for me - Tyrion's trial. Shae was convincing and Tyrion's reactions and that speech were unbelievable. Such an emotionally full performance by Dinklage, this made up for him hardly appearing in previous episodes after the wedding. The other parts were well-done, but did not blow me away (I am not sure about Hazzea and Hizdahr, though the actor was perfect, they cast him suitably). Oberyn build-up was nice and we can certainly prepare for the pay-off of all his scenes.
Overall, a superb episode with Dinklage's speech being the main highlight.
Â 
Episodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6:Â Â  7;10;8;9;10;8/10.

300	binga	2014-05-12	A lot of people are saying this is the best episode. That is a bit much, it has the best moment with Tyrion's speechÂ but other parts I was kind of lukewarm about. Stannis has really been diminished and I am not sure why. I am not in love with the character but I think heÂ has value in the story. Â
301	Onion Seaworth	2014-05-12	I feel like the asha/yara storming the dreadfort was sloppy and pointless I don't understand why they ran from two dogs and they were armed. But everything else made up for it I especially liked the whole part with Jamie and tywin.


Simple tactics.
they focus on Ramsay and the bastard boys, the bitches would bite her leg off, focus on the dogs and ramsay and his boys could rush in and stab poor Yarasha and her Ironborn through the heart.
although I had wished to see the chase from the dogs something simmilair to the previous Ramsay chase, or if he had caputured Yarasha and do a hunt with her later.
Â 
beasts are some of the best offensive one can have they are vicious and dangerous aswell expendable.
So to you who say she could have killed the bitches and Ramsay along with his remains of the troops are wrong.
Â 
On topic,
10. I liked it all, although the dreadfort attack was a bit too short and edited **I loved to see Ramsay fight, laughing in his opponents faces why he simply wailed on them with his mace and dagger.
I have said I like Show ramsay a bit more then Book Ramsay because of the sick twisted joker esque characteristics in the show. (although I still love book Ramsay) I only wish for them to tell more horrifying stories about him. (like in the books)
Mereen although I am not a fan of Dany was very good, standing by her descision and such.
and ofcourse the Trial, I have no words it was perfect pure and simple.
Â 
fav so far and 10 out of 10
302	Dany4eva	2014-05-12	I say 8. Loved loved Yara's speech and then it just ended horribly. Reek scene was super cool and the only reek/ramsay scene I enjoyed so far. Â Stannis was boring as he is in the books. Drogon was magnificent. I like the additions to Hizdahr. Emilia's acting was great. You could feel her uneasiness, regret, trepidation and so forth. I cried a little when Shae testified against Tyrion. The look on his faceÂ  . Oberyn turns me on
303	Dudu42	2014-05-12	My favorite place in Essos, Braavos, finally appeared. And it looked amazing. It had this Venetian feel (with the Rhodes Colossus making it cooler), corresponding with how I imagined the city would be like. And Davos is outstanding.
Â 
But clearly this episode was about Tyrion's trial more than anything. The Meereen part was slow paced and the Dreadfort assault bothered me (mostly because it seems they invaded it's shores, which is weird, considering Dreadfort faces Essos, not the Iron Isles). But thanks to the trial, I gave it a solid 9.
304	sj4iy	2014-05-12	8/10. The last half was brilliant, the first half seemed disjointed. Also, no Starks.
305	Miss Carnahan	2014-05-12	9, best episode of the season so far!
Â 
The bath scene was a bit awkward, but the trial was soooo good. Dinklage really delivered! His confession at the end might even have been better than the one in ASOS.
Â 
Also, it's worth mentioning that Liam Cunningham is absolutely perfect as Davos, he never disappoints.

Â 
Couldn't agree more.
307	Stannis Eats No Peaches	2014-05-12	Gave it a 9. Excellent episode, my favourite of the season so far. Pointless Dreadfort assault was pointless, but the Reek parts were really well done, I loved Davos and they absolutely nailed the trial.
308	Trillian	2014-05-12	Brilliant episode, made it even better by some great performances. Lian Cunningham, Alfie Allen, Peter Dinklage and Nikolaji Coster-Valdau delivered amazing scenes, I cannot wait for more.
309	TimEaston	2014-05-12	Well that was an epic episodeÂ
310	The Faithless Man	2014-05-12	the asha/ironborn stuff was poor, although Theon gave a very good performance. Â The Dany scenes were average, Davos and the Iron Bank was great. Â Tyrion and the whole trial was very, very good overall, But Tyrion's speech was just spine-tinglingly excellent - best part in the series for me so far.Â

311	MyLittleFinger	2014-05-12	Man Cogman just has the flow right. Even scenes that aren't memorable or have some massive significance just flow so well.Â
312	Words of Winter	2014-05-12	I gave it a 9.
Â 
Too much nudity.Â  Brothel scene was fine. Ramsey scene did not add anything. He should have killed her after the act and then the blood on his chest would have been more disturbing and the scene would have meaning beyond bow-chicka-bow-ow. (perv quotient.)
Â 
I understood the Yara/Asha scene was actually more to show the "death" of the Theon her brother, but the escape/retreat didn't flow well.Â  It was a "WTF, did I miss something?" break, in my mind, similar to the poor introduction of Barriston Selmy last season.Â  He shows up, fights Jorah and is 15 feet away with Jorah holding him and all of the sudden he daggers the mantacor.Â  It didn't flow very well is what I'm saying.
Â 
Tyrion and Davos saved the show for a 9.

314	Baltan	2014-05-12	A plump 9. Awesome episode, one of the best of the entire series.
Â 
For the trial alone it did deserve a 10. But because we are among fans, I allowed myself to lower my vote because of small nitpickings.
315	TheHouseHB	2014-05-12	After re-watching the episode I bump this up from an 8 to a 9.5
316	TheNorth's1stKnight	2014-05-12	9 best episode of the season next to the purple wedding.
317	Skoboe	2014-05-12	9. Would have been a 10 but for the introduction of Hizdar which was a bit weak IMO for a character that will have quite an important role later on.
318	ground_control	2014-05-12	There was. It was right on top. You could see the horns.


Ok, I just watched it a third time in better light and with pause and *now* I can see it. Â Still, that was my only issue with that part of the Mereen scene, and Drogon clearly passed over the boy before flaming and the goat herd didn't look upset, so I assumed it wasn't a child anyway, so it was a pretty minor issue anyway.

To be fair I watched the episode sober for once. My judgement might be clouded.Â
320	dmo862000	2014-05-12	I'm sorry but the trial may have been the greatest scene ever. Who cares what came before. I was left stunned and in awe. 10/10.I go wiTH my initial feeling which is shock and astoundment.
321	The Dragon Prince	2014-05-12	I gave it a 10/10. I LOVED this episode.
322	DolorousKim	2014-05-12	I found this to be a very strong episode overall -- not quite at the perfect "10" level from start to finish of a Baelor or a Blackwater, but very gripping entertainment.Â  I rated it a 9.
Â 
What worked for me:
Have to mention Peter Dinklage's extraordinary performance in the number one slot.Â  His acting in this episode was as strong as, or stronger than, any performance that we've seen in the series to date in my opinion.Â  I can't imagine any serious fan of this show not being emotionally impacted by his delivery.Â  He was simply perfection.
Liam Cunningham gets my number 2 slot: both in his scene with the Iron Bank and with his old running buddy Salladhor, he totally stole the spotlight.Â  It's about time this season that we got to see (be reminded of) what he can contribute when Davos gets some time at center stage.Â  Now, perhaps the show will afford Stephen Dillane the same opportunity?
Coming in at number three is Conleth Hill's throne room dialogue with Pedro Pascal.Â  It's a crime and a shame when an actor of Hill's caliber is so chronically underused.Â  I've really been missing Varys this season, so I was thrilled with this scene, and I didn't particularly care that it was a non-book creation.Â  I like these little periodic glimpses into Varys' mind.
Number 4 is Alfie Allen's Reek.Â  I don't particularly like Reek in either book or show form, but there's no doubting Allen's acting chops in portraying him.Â  His completed transformation from Theon to Reek has been mind-blowing to behold.
Finally, at number 5, I have to give a nod of acknowledgement to Gemma Whelan, for a rousing delivery of the Iron Born's call to arms speech on the way to the Dreadfort.Â  If show Yara is missing the spark and the humor of book Asha, I'm convinced it's down to the way the writing depicts the character, and not Whelan's acting.
Â 
What didn't work for me:
Very little but minor quibbles this week, which include the fairly clunky progression of the Dreadfort invasion / Dreadfort retreat, and a less than gripping Dany segment in Meereen.
323	Daenor	2014-05-12	Gave a 9 in this one.Should have been a 10 not for the Asha rescue attempt which didn't exactly excite me.Theon having turned completely to Reek was very good,Davos scenes as well and of course the trial was fabulous.

					
					
							Edited by Daenor, 12 May 2014 - 07:19 PM.
324	ChildoftheTropicalForest	2014-05-12	voted 9 for Tyrion's trial and Peter Dinklage's "confession" what an actor!Â  Also found Alfie Allen's descent into "Reek" really moving and believeable...Â great makeup job on his scarring btwÂ even if the storyline of Asha/Yara's rescue left me perplexed as to it's purpose...Â  Also thought the visuals were fantastic:Â  Titan of Bravos, Drogon and the goats, cannot wait until next week to finish up Tyrion's storyline.
325	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-05-12	I wrote my critique before reading any comments.Â  Kind of funny the comment directly before mine directly contradicts my argument.Â  I believe parts of it didn't flow well but others do. Tomato-Tomato, I guess.

Â 
I agree. I didn't feel there was a very good 'flow' during the first half of the episode: from the light and almost comedic Saan/Davos scene into the rousing monologue by Yara, some underwhelming fighting then a very WTF flight.... I liked how intense the Reek/Ramsay scene was, but it was spoiled at the start by the confusion over flight of the Iron Born.
326	aFeastForDragons	2014-05-12	Loved it even if the Dreadfort bit was a bit silly and Dany's scene was so boring.
Â 
The trial was amazing. Maybe the best thing they've ever done in the show. Peter Dinklage was incredible.
327	Dragon Queen	2014-05-12	I rated it a 7. Although the trial was great start to finish, no complaints there, superb acting- the first half not so much. If the episode had only been the trial, would have been a 9 or 10.
+Trial
+Tywin, Tyrion, Jaime acting and scenes
+Ending with the cliffhanger of "Who will be the champion on each side, did Tyrion really just declare a trial by combat?"
I enjoyed that the show made it a point to bring back everyone who Tyrion has publicly humiliated in past seasons (Trant(?), Cersei, Pycelle). The first time you watch the show or read the books, it's very easy to sympathize with Tyrion and feel that all of his problems are because he's a quoted "ugly" dwarf. However, when re-reading the books, I couldn't help but notice all the times that Tyrion can't resist making a smart remark to people he should be allies with. It's not smart to antagonize the future King you will have no power over (Joffrey), and he should have known his time as Hand of the King was short-lived and depended on Tywin being off at war. Pycelle was loyal to the Lannisters (Tywin/Cersei), and I think Tyrion should have supported Pycelle more. Fighting against your own powerful family is not smart. I think he should have shown more loyalty to his family.
There's no guarantees he would have won his father and sister over, but he made himself look incredibly guilty. He dug himself his own grave with all his quips, jokes, insults, threats, socially unacceptable behavior, and Cersei seized the chance to push him into it.
- Asha/Yara's failed Theon rescue attempt. We see her plan this rescue attempt last season, she doesn't appear until episode 6, and then it fails? Lame.
- Stannis. If there are 2 things that hold this character back, it's his unpopularity and the fact that he is brittle and will "break before he bends." I don't know why he sails all the way to Braavos to tell some financial guys that he needs money because he deserves to be king, and then expects them to hand him over some cash. Davos does prove his worth here again.
- Endless Theon/Ramsay scenes. I don't see the point of Theon's story arc and the sexposition/torture-position? scenes. We get it, last season was pretty clear, he loses his manhood and is a completely broken human being. Can something besides more torture and sex torture happen with these characters?

328	Zachary Snow	2014-05-12	i hated how easily asha got in and out of the dread fort although the scene with theon was good so you kinda have to overlook that, and oberyn makes the episode.... oberyn can be master of absolute fucking awesomeness..... 10 for me, best of the seasonÂ
329	Lord Carson	2014-05-12	- Endless Theon/Ramsay scenes. I don't see the point of Theon's story arc and the sexposition/torture-position? scenes. We get it, last season was pretty clear, he loses his manhood and is a completely broken human being. Can something besides more torture and sex torture happen with these characters?


That's the nature of their relationship. It's all torture. Whether it be mental or physical, it's always torture. Asking to stop with the torture scenes is asking to cut Theon and Ramsay out of the show. At least this one introduced how Moat Cailin will happen, advancing their plot a bit.
330	The Red Haired Viper	2014-05-12	8. Great episode,  but the Yara scene was pointless.
331	rmholt	2014-05-12	There was. It was right on top. You could see the horns.

It's best for me to check my expectations - it was clearly only a goat that was enveloped in flame and carried off and the goat skull couldn't have been more evident - unless one was expecting something else.
332	Lady of Dragonstone	2014-05-12	I gave this episode a 9.
I would have given this episode a ten if it hadn't included the Theon-bathtime scene, which just wasn't to my taste.
The Yara filler was pretty pointless but I guess we have to see the Greyjoys sometime. The scene with her and Theon in the kennel had my blood pumping. Amazing acting and directing. Much better than the Craster's Keep filler.
The Hizdahr and Dany scene was my favorite. Great acting, great scene, and love the casting.
Very cool that we got to see some of the workings of the IB. I loved that Davos in that scene, and Jaime in the Tywin scene, both question what will happen once there are no Lannisters left. Foreshadowing anyone?
Peter Dinklage was on par at the trial. Varys's snappy answer to Tyrion's question - meow! Obyern's questions made me chuckle. Shae's "confession" made me raise my eyebrows. And hell yes to Tyrion's plea. Give me more episodes like this please, HBO!

Otherwise, PERFECT.

Â But Peter's performance on trial was outstanding to say the least. Â And when he was going on the Lords and Ladies saying "I should have let Stannis KILL YOU ALL!!!" Â I thought was hilarious. Oh and one more great thing was seeing the Titan Of Braavos, it's incredible to see it on screen like that.

344	Kenyatta	2014-05-13	Seriously -- when Asha/Yara gave the Pulp Fiction hardest pipe-hitting Ironborn speech at the end of Season 3, I was expecting to see them getting literally medieval on the Boltons. Â Instead, it's like, "no harm, no foul, you keep Theon, we'll just put our tails between our legs and sail all the way back around Westeros, see you next season."
Â 


This right here. She was like that biker chick at the end of Weird Science, "You have a lovely home." And Ramsey...what was that? He looked like uncle Joe fixin' to carve up the Christmas turkey and then he sicks the Bumpus hounds on them? Really? Wuss...
345	Holymoly	2014-05-13	Quite simply the best episode ever, and I've been pretty critical of the lastÂ  two series. Helped significantly by the decision by Sky in the UK to include only a single ad break. Acting of the highest order from the real actors of the cast. Dinklage, Dance, Coster -Waldau, Dillane and Cunningham
346	Kenyatta	2014-05-13	there is no way McConaughey doesn't win the Emmy. His monologue in 1x2 about his daughter actually almost brought me to tears, and nothing I watch ever does. One could pick any scene with McConaughey in it and present that to the Emmy's.


I agree. After the second episode it was over. Everything else was just Matty piling on. The monologue about dreams and monsters at the end of it? I'm still waiting for the right time to break that one out...
347	Domonju	2014-05-13	Solid 9. Except for the clunky Dreadfort 'invasion' everything was solid. The acting was good, especially from Alfie, but the scene and concept were poor.
348	Daske	2014-05-13	9 from me. Loved it all. Enjoyed the Dreadfort scene which many don't seem to - we needed some action and the first part was pretty much what the IronbornÂ didÂ to break intoÂ Winterfell, I can understand running from attack dogs, and the real purpose was to show how much Theon had lost it which was amazing. Don't get the minorÂ fuss about the bones - that was clearly aÂ pre-cursorÂ for later. And yes, the trial was pitch perfect all round and one of the best moments of the whole series.
349	Jaqen H'gcarl	2014-05-13	Dinklage is outrageously good. Holy fuck.
350	BrienneofQarth	2014-05-13	.
Somebody give that Dinklage an Emmy! - He was electrifying! 
And wasn't it just brilliant to see the Titan of Bravos at last? (and in the credits, too!). And Dany's throneroom! And (at last) some moreÂ dragony goodness! And a fantastic alternative way of cooking goats...
Â 
I liked this episode about a thousand times more than last week's. I know it's not always possible, but I think the individual episodes areÂ  a lot stronger when they limit the number of POVsÂ portrayedÂ to just a few. Giving the trial air time and breathing spaceÂ  really made it for me!
Â 
I have mixed feelings about the Dreadfort scenes. For no rational reason at all,Â I didn't loathe it like the Craster's stuff. I think it's a good way of keeping these characters relevant, when they seem to drop off the radar in the books. Â
351	Rhaegar I Targaryen	2014-05-13	Dinklege was so good.Â
352	Diehard_si	2014-05-13	9 for me.
Â 
The Yara scene was a bit daft and I wasn't overly keen on the Stannis scene.
Â 
The trial was however great and the hall at Meereen was pretty much exactly as I'd pictured it in my head. Peter Dinklage was absolutely superb though.
Â 
Not sure on the guy place Mace though, he seems weak
353	Giorgio Corrado	2014-05-13	This was a 10 especially when it came too Tyrion's trial can't wait to see Tyrion will pick as his champion.Â  I also loved the Iron Bank scene sure made me feel like I was going for a bank loan all you had too do was watch the chairs the IB sat and where Stanis and Davos sat.
354	zeppelincheetah	2014-05-13	I rated it a 9.Â  Loved everything about it save for the Braavosi scene.Â  It just irked me that the representative from the iron bank didn't speak Braavosi.Â  Also althrough there were plenty of scenes that were straight from the pages (Tyrion's trial) some of the made up scenes weren't written up to my standards, the braavosi scenes.Â  I loved theon's scenes and I love how it started out with Asha (can't remember her show name) reading the letter from Ramsay.
355	Ran	2014-05-13	601 votes in, 8.79 average, 9 median, 8.95 normalized average.
356	Lesk	2014-05-13	Gave it a 9. Excellent trial scenes, great acting from all involved. The DreadfortÂ invasion was a bit naff and completely made up, hence not a 10 for me. I suppose it fulfilled a purpose re-affirming the Theon/Reek/Ramsey relationship but it could have been handled better. Otherwise it was awesome.
Â 
PS
I must question the casting of the Iron Bank chairman and Hizdar. English viewers will (hopefully) know what I mean. Both are rather comedic characters in several series so I couldn't help thinking of these whilst viewing. I know it's not the actor's fault, etc., just a comment.
357	Valar Morghulis Not Today	2014-05-13	I loved the episode...
Â 
Though when I rated I forgot about the Dreadfort scenes, which started well but Asha/Yara & companions running away from a few dogs despite being armed - plus giving Ramsay time to unlock the cages? Â I get the need for dramatic pauses but it seemed a bit stupid.
Â 
Though I'm still happy to give it a 10 as Tyrion was a total boss, Tywin and Oberyn were fantastic whilst Cersei's actress is also doing a great job of making me hate her, also a good appearance from Stanis. Â 

Finished the episode wanting more thinking it was the best they'd done for a while!
358	Julia Caesar	2014-05-13	Excellent episode, gave it a 10. Loved everything about it (well almost loved the Yara/Reek/Ramsay scenes). Tywin, Oberyn and most of all Tyrion....wow!!!Â
359	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-05-13	This wasn't a perfect episode. I originally gave it a 9, but after watching it for a third time and still being blown away by Dinklage's performance I had to give it a 10.Â
360	GSP	2014-05-13	Gave it a nine.
Â 
Loved the entire trial and thought this was one of the scenes the series trulyÂ nailed. IIRC Tyrion got in some even stronger lines than he did in the book. And yeah, Dinklage is just awesome!
361	Count Balerion	2014-05-13	Episode 6: this was heading into solid 8 territory until the trial, perhaps even including the trial until PD
pushed it up to 9.Â  Most of the other segments were of either 7 or 8 quality.Â  I'm not sure why they
changed the Daenerys segment so much from the books; I suppose they wanted to highlight the
crucifixion issue, or maybe they thought the masters had acquiesced too easily in the books (although
that's not really the case).Â  Still, it worked decently well.Â  Ramsay dragged a little, and I could've done
without Oberyn/Varys.
362	Sir Stonelea	2014-05-13	A resounding 9 for this episode. Ramsay and Theon scenes were annoyingly boring (..can't believe they're wasting time with this...). All 9 points are for Dinklage's superb acting!
363	Shebara	2014-05-14	gave it a 9,. just because of the brilliant handling of Tyrions trial: Peter Dinklage made it Shakespearean, and the interaction between the 3 Lannister men....ahhh the looks!

367	Ran	2014-05-14	Did a quick look comparing polling, and averaging out their episodes, George averages a bit higher than Cogman. Cogman has been less variable, though. George's average was brought well down by "The Bear and the Maiden Fair", though, and I suppose it should be noted that it seems a couple of the scenes people were most negative about seem not to have actually been written by George, according to GRRM's Bluray commentary, so... perhaps that mitigates. Or perhaps not.
Â 
ETA: Averaging out just my own votes concurs that I hold a similar view -- George pips Cogman, but is more inconsistent (thanks to "The Bear and the Maiden Fair", but also thanks to "Blackwater"; GRRM's the only one of the two to have gotten a 10 from me so far).

Â 
Australians felt the same about Eric Bana. He was fortunate enough to land the international roles to break out of his comedy stereotype. You just have to look at what the actor is doing now rather than what they did in the past.

The other being... let me guess... Baelor?Â 
Â 
ETA: Strike that. I seem to have misinterpreted you. You didn't say that you gave only two episodes a 10, but that Cogman is the one (as opposed to Martin) you've never given a 10. Right?
Â 
I personally simply adoreÂ Kissed by Fire. That one deserves a straight 10 in my opinion. One of the very best episodes the show has ever done.

370	Zeppelin	2014-05-14	As every single person who viewed this episode has said, Tyrion's trial was perfection. Totally engrossing in every way.
Â 
Loved every character present at the trial and on this alone I would have scored it a 10. Add Oberyn, Tywin, Varys, Davos, the sadististly demented Ramsey Snow and mind numbingly, tortured Reek and and i'm still voting a 10.
Â 
However, Ashe/Yarra's attempted rescue of Theon/Reek was laughable in so many ways and Dany continues to bore me, although I did enjoy that little bitch slap she received
Â 
I gave it a 9

Â 
I'd say D&D are the best GoT writers. They always deliver on the big moments, and, unlike GRRM or BC (both of whom are amazing, but BC>GRRM), have much more on their plate. They probably get less time, but produce amazing scenes. The Rains of Castamere, Baelor and And Now His Watch Is Ended are all undoubtedly some of the greatest episodes of TV ever, and among the 7 best GoT episodes- BC and GRRM both have two (they get less, but very juicy scenes). We're incredibly lucky to have these 4 amazing writers working on GoT- I can't wait to see how Dave Hill does next season!

Â 
I think the argument goes - not unfairly - that Cogman is more consistent. While D&D do occasionally write a weaker script here and there, all of Cogman's episodes have been really top notch. In my view, he wrote the second best episode of Season 2,Â What Is Dead May Never Die,Â it's a tie betweenÂ Rains of CastamereÂ andÂ Kissed by Fire for the honour of being the best Season 3 episode, andÂ Laws of Gods and MenÂ has clearly been the best episode of Season 4 so far.Â Bryan is very very good indeed.

On the other hand, I feel that GRRM is somewhat overrated on these boards. Not that his episodes are bad, they're certainly not, but besidesÂ Blackwater I don't think they particularly stand out. TheÂ Pointy EndÂ is great, but not quite on the level of episodes directly preceding or following it.Â The Bear and the Maiden FairÂ is among the weaker Season 3 outings (though still pretty good; I don't get all the hate directed at it orÂ The Climb), whileÂ The Lion and the Rose, althoughÂ a good and enjoyable episode, is somewhat uneven at times.

I think the argument goes - not unfairly - that Cogman is more consistent. While D&D do occasionally write a weaker script here and there, all of Cogman's episodes have been really top notch. In my view, he wrote the second best episode of Season 2,Â What Is Dead May Never Die,Â it's a tie betweenÂ Rains of CastamereÂ andÂ Kissed by Fire for the honour of being the best Season 3 episode, andÂ Laws of Gods and MenÂ has clearly been the best episode of Season 4 so far.Â Bryan is very very good indeed.

Â 
Oh yes, Bryan Cogman is undoubtedly more consistent. However, he also only has one to two episodes to write every season, so he can focus on those instead of having to be responsible for 7 episodes per season. This season, D&D have been incredibly consistent, and I'm pretty sure they will knock it out of the park with the last 4! By the way, I agree that GRRM is a little overrated on the board, if only due to him making the worst episode of the series (barring The Night Lands) when the material he was given was slightly weaker than what he usually gets (about on par with what D&D get in their first three episodes, but they seem to do a better job).Â

374	Mr Fixit	2014-05-14	worst episode of the series (barring The Night Lands)


Â 
Yeah, about that. Why does everyone hate poorÂ Night Lands so much? Â I really dig that episode! KL stuff is fantastic, we see the introduction of the one and only Salladhor Saan, Theon's arrival on Pyke is handled very well, and in hindsight I especially like the changes made to Jon's story - witnessing a WW carry away the baby - because it leads to Jon's great explanation to Mance on why he left the NW (much better and more believable than in the books, I think).Â 
Â 
Is it because of all the nudity in this episode? Theon on the boat, that hilarious and truly over-the-top scene in LF's brothel that cracks me up every time I see it, and then Stannis and Mel? It was a bit much, I'll grant you that. Coupled with some of the more pronounced deviations from the books, I can understand why people rate it lower. As I said, though, in my opinion it's a very good episode.
Â 
If I had to pick the weakest episodes so far - and even those I like as they have enough to recommend them - those would probably be: 1x02Â The Kingsroad andÂ 2x08Â The Prince of Winterfell.Â Those two are the only episodes I feel are really mediocre. Everything else is at least good.

375	Drogon's Personal Trainer	2014-05-14	Late putting in my two-pennorth - but here goes: An 8 for me, and I loved it.
Â 
Getting the bad out of the way.... I think the show runners hate the Ironborn as much as me  - what on earth was that mess at the Dreadfort? Â Although every time I see Alfie Allen's Theon now I want to cry, I just thought the scene did a great disservice to Yarasha after her stirring speeches at the end of the last season and in this one. Â I do know that the point of the scene was for the Ironborn to have closure on Theon so that the next step of their storyline can go forward, but my, was it clumsily handled! Â I enjoyed the bath scene in a twisted, isn't Ramsay evil sort of way, because yet again Alfie was superb. Â A totally broken man. Â It will make his act of bravery next season all the more moving.
Â 
What I loved was the opener in Braavos. Â Dillane can do no wrong for me, and he gave a masterclass in how to convey words with no lines yet again - the reproving looks he gave Davos were more eloquent than any words he could have spoken. Â Miss Clarke, please take note: this is how to act with facial expression alone. Â Less is more. Â Cunningham continues to impress, and I got Sala as a bonus, so all in all that was a winning sequence for me.
Â 
In fairness to Emilia's Dany, though, she did find a third facial expression in this episode, and I'm going to cut her a lot of slack for it. Â I could see her trying very hard to be more subtle. Â I thought her throne room looked magnificent. Â I'm not yet sure about Hizdahr, but the writers do seem to be giving him a motive here for later events. Â But are we ever going to get a situation where Jorah and Barristan are more than appendages? Â I'm getting a bit sick of them flanking Dany in her scenes and doing very little.
Â 
But these are small gripes. Â Now on to the great stuff: Â The trial was magnificently staged, and we saw a convincing change in Tyrion, turning to the dark side at last as he finally snapped. Â The dramatic tension was masterfully portrayed. Â I don't quite buy into the hyperbole about Dinklage's performance - there was a bit too much facial gurning for my tastes, but his lines were brilliant. Â NCW stole it for me - again, less is more - and his more subtle reactions were mesmerising. Â I also loved the scene between him and Tywin - but then, playing opposite Dance brings out the best in everyone. Â Pedro Pascal did fine work in this episode too. Â 
Â 
And I give a 10 to the CGI department for magnificent shots of Drogon. Â The Dany scenes always have more oomph when we get a dragon or two Â 
Â 
All in all, one of the best episodes so far. Â I'm looking forward to seeing dark Tyrion now. Â
376	Ran	2014-05-14	Â 
ETA: Strike that. I seem to have misinterpreted you. You didn't say that you gave only two episodes a 10, but that Cogman is the one (as opposed to Martin) you've never given a 10. Right?
Â 
I personally simply adoreÂ Kissed by Fire. That one deserves a straight 10 in my opinion. One of the very best episodes the show has ever done.


Â 
Correct. I gave "Kissed by Fire" a 9. I agree it's the best episode Cogman's written to date.
Â 
On the forum, GRRM's "The Pointy End" rates as the second best episode of its season, and the first 9+ average for the show. The finale of the season reached 9.09.
Â 
"Blackwater" is almost one full point ahead of every other episode in its season.
Â 
As to "The Bear and the Maiden Fair", the risibly raunchy Theon-Ramsay scene was the biggest beef a lot of people had (us, too), and everyone held it up as GRRM's poor writing... only for him to note that he didn't write any of it. Same with the bear pit, also from Benioff and Weiss, although there it was more of an issue of the simple realities of filming with a trained animal -- there's just so much one can do with it to "sell" it.Â 
Â 
If you look at the rest of the material in that episode, there's some really good stuff, including what I think is the best Jon-Ygritte scene in the show. That episode without those two poor scenes would have been much better rated, I think (or without the one and -- somehow -- finding a better way to shoot the latter).

Now that we've seen all 5 Cogman episodes produced thus far, do you think he's the best GoT writer?Â 
Â 
Better than Martin mayhap? Â 


"Unlikely"
Â 
I liked Cogman before this season, but since I gave "his" episodes a 3 and 4 this Season, I'd say he's way below George's league (and should never be given another episode). Â Of course, without seeing his exact script, it's hard to tell, since some scenes in "his" episodes may not have been his, and since he's not the director, it's hard to tell if the writing was at fault or the directors. Â For example, this episode was noticeably shorter then others, and Dreadfort scene (the biggest negative factor for me) was so bad that it looks like stuff was cut way after filming, so Cogman may have written the scene much better than it was delivered, but without any way to tell, I have to go by what was delivered.

Â 
Now that you mention the scenes, they seem quite solid to me. However, when I was watching it (which I haven't done for a long time), it was the one that had the least impact on me. A lot of people complain about the show, but I am extremely pumped up after every single episode. This was the only one that didn't have that kind of impact on me for some reason. It might have had to do with the fact that was the first and only episode I watched with other people, so some of the nude scenes were a little... awkward. I might go and rewatch it now 
Â 
By the way, what do you consider the best episodes of the series (top 5)?Â
379	Mr Fixit	2014-05-14	By the way, what do you consider the best episodes of the series (top 5)?Â 


Â 
Arghhhh, too constraining... does not compute...
Â 
I'll recuse myself from rating Season 4 because I need more time to let it truly sink in. A nice proper binge watch in a few months ought to do it. I do think it's very good though.
Â 
Anyway, I think TOP5 would have to be (in no particular order)Â Blackwater, You Win or You Die, Rains of Castamere, Kissed by Fire, Baelor,Â andÂ What Is Dead May Never Die.Â Okay, that's 6, but I can't really take anything off that list.
380	BassChamber	2014-05-14	Dinklage saved the episode.
Â 
Yara at Dreadfort was a mess. And I am worried now about the show losing credibility with invincible super-villians (Shirtless Ramsay against armored IB, come on...) and teleporting characters (Yara and IB scape from Dreadfort).
Â 
No good, dont follow that route please.
381	AnotherCrannogman	2014-05-14	Did they cut out a Ramsay rape and killing scene? The episode was eight minutes short and the prior episode six or seven minutes short. Are they toning it down after Jaime scene?

Seems to me something was cut. I suspect Myranda died in some way but they chose to cut it for whatever reason. Maybe due to the recent Great Spring Outrage of 2014?

383	7th-key	2014-05-14	Gave it an 8, just for the enthusiasm that I felt the show is back on course and for (apparently) deciding to cut Ramsay offing his playmate. I had enough of the irrelevant sexual violence, and the boob quota fans have the Bravosi baths scene.
Â 
The trial was not perfect. Shae's motivation is not clear due to the change from the books and Sibel Kekilli's acting. But the interaction of all the major players was exhilarating.
Â 
I didn't get the Bank thing, they are supposed to have their own informants, yet they are impressed by Davos' personal story, while Stannis isn't capable of saying one interesting word.
Â 
Yara: again, like in every episode of this season, stupid contradictions. Like having 4 king guards bypassed by Margaery. Here, fierce Iron Borns running from a naked Ramsay and a couple of dogs. What's up with this confusing storytelling? Â 
Â 
I liked the setting up of the dragon killing the goat for now.
Â 
Beautiful CGI camera pan from Stannis' ship to the overview of Bravo.

385	Lord Carson	2014-05-14	I doubt they cut anything after the Jaime and Cersei scene, considering the episode has been this runtime since the information about it was first revealed I believe. Also just because Ramsay had blood on his chest doesn't mean he killed Myranda. I'm sure Yara left guards outside that Ramsay ran into.

I don't know why/if/when anything was specifically cut, but the scene looked like it was missing things in a few places (like any believable reason the Ironborn didn't win based on what was shown, how Ramsey got bloody the way he did without being killed, how Ashayara didn't kill Ramsey, or (if she failed) how they escaped. Â Since the episode was light on time, we have to assume *something* was cut at some time -- if not, the failure to have filmed the missing scenes is even worse mistake.
387	Lord Carson	2014-05-14	I'm not saying that they definitely didn't cut something, that is totally possible. I just think it's extremely unlikely that they did it in the middle of the season.

How much of an edge did dropping the low episode give Season 4? Â I'm assuming S1 would still be first and S3 second, and S2 and S4 (with only a 0.06 difference even with the fudged numbers) are pretty clearly tied for last place, which supports the general consensus that S2 was clearly lower quality than S01 and S03, and that S04 is shaping up to be as bad as S02.

What's worth noting, of course, is that we're talking less than half a point separating S3 from being "equal" to S1. In the grand scheme of things, it's not like there's a truly enormous difference in how the forum is reacting. It's a bit of dissatisfaction or disappointment, not outright rejection (for the poll-participating membership of the forum as a collective group).

I made my post here, not "around the Internet". Â Around *here*, Season 4 has been getting a lot of hate.

I don't know, that's how I feel....
Â 
I mean think about it, the best part of this phase of Bran's journey that they haven't covered (I am referring to the development of Bran's powers, which has already been adequately addressed), is meeting Coldhands. Where the hell is Coldhands in the show!? It's mind boggling if you ask me.Â

Median = 10Since no margin of error is ever posted one takes it for what it is.(Because there are Trolls at IMDB.)I don't have time to read the 'internal' reviews , but I am sure there not 7889 of them.

Actually, Ran said that while there is more traffic now, fewer people are voting, so if any change is to be made, reducing the percentage of top/bottom cuts would be in order (not saying that any change is necessary, just that if a change is made, increasing is the wrong direction).
Â 
Looking at the current data, we have about 685 votes, so 5% is about 34. Â That eliminates all votes below '6' and 15 out of 19 votes of '6' while only getting rid of 34 of 205 '10' votes.

While D&D do occasionally write a weaker script here and there, all of Cogman's episodes have been really top notch. In my view, he wrote the second best episode of Season 2,Â What Is Dead May Never Die,Â it's a tie betweenÂ Rains of CastamereÂ andÂ Kissed by Fire for the honour of being the best Season 3 episode, andÂ Laws of Gods and MenÂ has clearly been the best episode of Season 4 so far.Â Bryan is very very good indeed.I think Cogman does an excellent job for a beginner. Last year he wrote probably the best dialog scene of the season.One keeps in mind that no matter who wrote an episode , even Martin, they are all messaged by Dave and Dan.The one thing I have noticed is that when David Benioff and Dan Weiss are somewhat buffaloed by a story from the books they don't write good material, it's too bad there is not another senior writer on staff who can say, "look I can see you understand the source material, but your coasting here!", think of about 6 episodes of season 2 , all by D&D and one by Vanessa Taylor, all seemed outlined as 'let's get this over' from the beginning.When something catches their interest , like all of season 1 they ace it.Then in season 3 the RW and DRACARYS ... well one could tell those where favorites, and carefully wrote those.Most of the time D&D really click, here and there they seem to drop the ball.
414	boojam	2014-05-17	AGAIN, I think the only way to improve ratings accuracy would be to vote per-scene as well as per-episode. Â Because it seems that most people are reading the poll as: This Episode -- Great or The Greatest So Far.I don't have the time to do that.
415	OnlyOne	2014-05-17	I would like to support the poster who complimented Nikolaj's acting. It has been consistently superb throughout the show and I think it is way better than anything Dinklage offered this season. So, if anyone deserves an Emmy nomination, it's Nikolaj.

Agreed.
416	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-05-18	NCW and GC were both stunning last season and have just rolled it along into this season like they didn't have a break.

maybe reading, watching and typing is beyond you
419	The Killer Snark	2014-05-19	I gave this a 7. It was quite possibly the weakest episode yet screened. The Daenarys scene was fine, but was ripped straight off of Priam's supplication to retrieve Hector's body in The Iliad. The Stannis scene was aimless filler, and of course contrary to the novels. The Tyrion trial was excellent, and it's nice to see the betrayal by Shae I'd feared might not actually happen. What dragged it down for me were the ludicrous scenes involving Asha's (Yara's) attempt to free Theon, which not only run totally contrary to the books and possibly might screw up their proper story arcs, but they were also badly acted, badly written, badly staged and seemed like something from a Monty Python sketch. But at least the implied (one-sided) homoeroticism of the Ramsay/Reek relationship was dwelt on in the somewhat poignant, and subtle, excellent scene near the end. But, boy was that failed Dreadfort rescue awful. As if Theon at any stage wouldn't have wished to be rescued when his sister opened his cage!
420	TheonsPhantomCock	2014-05-20	I only gave it a 7 and I'll tell you why. I just didn't rate the acting in some scenes. I felt the Danny and Hiz scene was just odd. Their acting just didn't quite sit right with me. It was lacking a little something, a little too affected. The looks from Selmy and Jorah were good, though. Plus, it made no sense as to why Hiz needed a translator when he then goes on to speak fluent Westerosi.
Â 
The trial was well played out and Lena and Charles Dance were great. Plus the chap who plays Jamie. I just didn't believe Dinklage's performance. It was really good, but again, was just lacking a little I don't know what.Â 
Â 
I liked the Asha scene. Her, Alfie Allen and the chap who plays Ramsay - all did brilliantly, but the fighting looked fake. The chap who plays Ramsay and Alfie should definitely figure for awards. The scene with him and Alfie was great. The little nervous looks really made it. Ramsay's eyes. His unspoken unpredictability. Brillant casting. I liked a lot of the little touches.
Â 
Oberyn was great too. Look at Lena Headley's hand at the end of the trial scene and her facial expressions. Same goes for Marg. Great skill in conveying feelings w/o doing much. Good, subtle acting skills.
Â 
Always love watching Varys too. Loved the scene with him and Oberyn as it raised a lot of qs regarding his true objectives.

And when they add in something stupid like Asha sailing all around Westeros, up a river, and attacking the Dreadfort and then running away because of stupid dogs, its really, really stupid?

Â 
Yes, I have noticed exactly that!
425	The Killer Snark	2014-05-22	It was total Monty Python stuff. I've said that before. And that's the worst I've seen Alfie Allen act with his, "No, I'm Reek, I'm Reek!"

560	Father of Dragons	2014-05-11	People really need to pay attention! Dontos rowed Sansa to a boat [in a foggy night] (so it cleared by morning, obviously). Dontos let Sansa go first, got shot, Littlefinger threw the necklace onto his body and left it in the boat. Obviously some fisherman found the boat with the body and took it to shore, probably reporting it to the guards.

You find a necklace with what appears to be semi-valuable stones with a dead man; do you hand it over to the guards? I have a hunch the dead men wouldn't be telling no tales anytime soon.

579	briantw	2014-05-11	You find a necklace with what appears to be semi-valuable stones with a dead man; do you hand it over to the guards? I have a hunch the dead men wouldn't be telling no tales anytime soon.


Â 
Maybe a Lannister ship found the boat? Â Tywin did order the ships to close off the bay.
580	lareine	2014-05-11	Exactly what I thought haha

Absolutely! Â Thugh it doesn't really surprise me that he'd know.

Â 
Peter Dinklage's Emmy episode for sure.
Â 
Am I the only one really surprised that Only Cat will be in 4x07 and not 4x10? I guess the episode title should have been a tipoff, but I sort of thought they would save that for the finale.

662	MoIaF	2014-05-11	It was a good episode, the trial was excellent.  
I was surprise they came out with the Hizface declaration.
663	jons nissa	2014-05-11	well, at least jaime's off the hook now for leaving the guard.
664	Colonel Green	2014-05-11	You find a necklace with what appears to be semi-valuable stones with a dead man; do you hand it over to the guards? I have a hunch the dead men wouldn't be telling no tales anytime soon.


If there was a reward out for information on the location of Dontos Hollard (which I guess there was, though we didn't hear anything about it, based on their knowing he escaped with Sansa), the fisherman would.
665	Trebla	2014-05-11	Peter Dinklage delivered. That was superb. The trial was very well done. The looks the characters gave: Tywin's knowing expressions that the fix is in, Jaime's doubt, Margaery's conflicted look. And the Red Viper perking up when Tyrion demanded trial by combat. Well done.
666	Stannis I	2014-05-11	WOW!!! Epic Tyrion!!

And I love the Greyjoy's theme song...
667	Fat Trell	2014-05-11	Episode ended strong. Dany's scene was good.
Ironborn was beyond stupid though

670	jons nissa	2014-05-11	also interesting that shae looked so scared. the tone i got from the books was bitter and angry. maybe they aren't going for she betrayed tyrion and sansa but that she was forced to do it.
671	Raksha 2014	2014-05-11	Tyrion/PD's reaction to TV-Shae's perjuring betrayal nearly made me cry. Â Hope they don't have him backslide into St. Tyrion again. Â Wow, Tyrion just owned the last few minutes, credible all the way.
672	The 10th Penny King	2014-05-11	Just a remarkable episode. Â That's all I can say. Â Stunning.
673	sj4iy	2014-05-11	Damn, that was incredibly awesome. Â Can't wait for some Viper-Mountain action.

Â Book Ramsay is a beast too.
675	MsLibby	2014-05-11	Part of me thinks Tywin will kill Shae and that's why Tyrion kills him.
676	MoIaF	2014-05-11	I didn't like the fact that Asha gave up,do,quickly after giving the pat awesome speech to her men.  Didn't feel,quite right.
677	Yanninho	2014-05-11	Great episode. Loved the trial. Tyrion was awesome. Potential Emmy winner scene.
678	Tom son of Tom	2014-05-11	I guess later in the season we'll get a scene where the goat herd comes back with his child's bones. I thought we were gonna get it this episode.
679	Newstar	2014-05-11	also interesting that shae looked so scared. the tone i got from the books was bitter and angry. maybe they aren't going for she betrayed tyrion and sansa but that she was forced to do it.

Â 
i agree. that and the necklace suddenly appearing in court are my only two complaints for tonight's episode.
681	sati	2014-05-11	The looks between Shae and Tywin made me wonder if they just remove Cersei from the reason for betrayal all together

Maybe now they start to cultivate the bitter/dark Tyrion.  They really have to get going on that.
683	Lord Godric	2014-05-11	That last scene gave me chills. Â The best episode of the season so far and Peter Dinklage did amazing.Â
684	Zman1863	2014-05-11	I think the back half of the episode was excellent, even if it started slow. My only real complaint was the Yara rescue, though I suppose I'm relieved the storyline won't last too long.Â
685	Yanninho	2014-05-11	I didn't like the fact that Asha gave up,do,quickly after giving the pat awesome speech to her men. Didn't feel,quite right.


Â 
During the speech she didn't know Theon would react like he did. It's understandable even if I agree this may have been done too quickly "Let's go to death !" and just after "Well get the fuck out"
686	ballajam	2014-05-11	Someone give Peter Dinklage an oscar cause that was spot on.Â 
Â 
And the scene wish Asha was predictable because having her rescue him would have gone too far from the books.Â
687	jons nissa	2014-05-11	The looks between Shae and Tywin made me wonder if they just remove Cersei from the reason for betrayal all together


Â 
that wouldn't surprise me. after all, we already had tywin order her to be brought to his rooms in a prior episode. plus they are making cersei way more sympathetic.
688	MoIaF	2014-05-11	i agree. that and the necklace suddenly appearing in court are my only two complaints for tonight's episode.

Oh that too, however, they need to start cultivated Tyrion's resentment of Sansa so that's probably what that's all about.
689	Yanninho	2014-05-11	What do you think about Mace turned into a comic character ?
Â 
I don't mind it, it's quite funny, but Loras being branded as the "gayknight", Mace just the dumb lord who stills live in his mother's pants, and Willos and Garlan cut out, not so much love for the Tyrell boys...
690	Stannis I	2014-05-11	Almost forget:
Â 
Tywin telling Mace Tyrell to be a good man and fetch him some ink and paper was.... remarkable. LOL
691	Lord Godric	2014-05-11	Â 
that wouldn't surprise me. after all, we already had tywin order her to be brought to his rooms in a prior episode. plus they are making cersei way more sympathetic.


But we know that Cersei was the one to procure Shae.Â
692	Mark Antony	2014-05-11	Really good episode. People will be raving about Dinklage but Alfie Allen is a phenomenal reek imo. Mace and Oberyn were both in fine form tonight along with Davos the legend
693	Raksha 2014	2014-05-11	What do you think about Mace turned into a comic character ?
Â 
I don't mind it, it's quite funny, but Loras being branded as the "gayknight", Mace just the dumb lord who stills live in his mother's pants, and Willos and Garlan cut out, not so much love for the Tyrell boys...

695	TaenaOfMyr	2014-05-11	Part of me thinks Tywin will kill Shae and that's why Tyrion kills him.


Â 
That would make no sense within the storyline though, with them having Shae have a similar role as in the books where she publicly betrays him at the trial. It almost certainly goes down just like in the books now.
Â 
Awaiting the complaints about how this final scene white washes Tyrion even further... 
Â
696	Fat Trell	2014-05-11	Why they have to do my man Mace like that? Let him be HBO.
697	Darth Pipes	2014-05-11	Really good episode.Â  I appreciate that several episodes this season have allowed one sequence to be the focus of the last half hour of the show.Â  Strong performance by Peter Dinklage as he managed to put over a scary mad Tyrion.Â  Also good performances by Liam Cunningham, Alfie Allen and Conleth Hill.
Â 
I enjoyed the Dreadfort battle until Ramsay pulled a Mr. Burns and released the hounds.Â  Yara's trip seemed to be a Battle at Craster's Keep diversion although certainly more entertaining than a lot of the Ironborn stuff.Â  I'm curious to see how things go from here.
Â 
Loved the shot of the Titan although I think that shot of the Meereen castle impressed me the most.Â  I have to say the guy playing Hizdhar was very good and I liked his scene with Dany.
I'm not a fan of turning Mace into a comic character either.Â  He might be a bumbling fool that everyone works around.Â  But the point is he's not supposed to think he's a bumbling fool and lackey.Â
698	Obebb	2014-05-11	My initial thoughts:Â 
Â 
I loved Braavos in the opening, it was very cute. The Braavos scene itself though, kind of weird. But still good. And very shiny. And I'm happy they showed Salla again. I don't know why, I just can't get enough of that guyÂ  
Â 
YarAsha storming the Dreadfort seemed like the most pointless thing in the history of everything. Maybe it's just me but that whole scene was completely useless aside from letting us remember that YarAsha exists (and is suddenly very dumb). Run into the fort, battle a little, run away. Done.
Â 
I like Tyrion's trial. That Shae stuff was great.
Â 
And Oberyn was on fire this episode. Cute, sexy, everythingÂ   I only wish the episode ended with him announcing he'd champion for Tyrion.
699	Newstar	2014-05-11	When TV Hizdahr said, "I pray you may never live to see a member of your family treated so cruelly," all I could think of was Viserys being killed by Drogo.
Â 
I kind of loved the scene with Dany smoothing over the goatherd matter and being all pleased with herself, only to be cut down to size by the confrontation with Hizdahr.

But yeah, the people I was with this evening were very shocked. Â They really thought he was going to the Wall a la Ned Stark. Â I was quite pleased with the final scene.

I thought The Mountain was going to be in this episode. Â I can't wait for that.

704	AzorAhai42	2014-05-11	I thought the episode was fantastic. Peter Dinklage rocked that performance, I feel like he can be dark now.Â 
Â 
Also, is moon door/Only Cat happening next episode???
705	Salad Days Saan	2014-05-11	Salladhor Saan.Â  By definition this is already a great episode.Â  Strong debut from Mark Gatiss as Chief Kneecapper of The Iron Bank.
Â 
Loved the rolling coin on the Braavos pop-up map.
Â 
Mace got lines!Â  And then he got a quill.Â  And the good parchment.
Â 
Varys/Oberyn needs to happen more, though we don't have much time.Â  Reminded me of the Varys/Littlefinger throne room scenes, in all the good ways.
Â 
Asha's speech had me ready to headbutt somebody.Â  They got into and out of that plot knot about as well as they could, the only way they could.Â  She couldn't win, but she couldn't lose, ergo schmozz ending.Â 
Â 
At least we got to see her ninja a dude with her axe.Â  And it was a Dreadfort mook so we don't even have to feel bad about it Â  Hopefully that'll be enough to tide me over until her next appearance halfway through Season 5 .Â  That and speculating on if that one dude in her crew who never said anything and never got named will become Qarl The Maid someday.
Â 
You know who was tremendous in a spot I wasn't expecting?Â  HIZDHAR.Â  That dude knocked it out of the park and made Dany look (and feel) like a complete idiot in just a couple minutes.Â  That's putting on a "killing them with kindness" clinic.Â  Tremendous scene.Â  Barristan had a nice I-Told-You-So look, too.Â  That was a really great scene.Â  AND, in those two minutes he did more to make me care about Meereen/Essos and the people in it/under Dany than GRRM did in 900 pages.Â  Seeing is Believing I suppose.
Â 
LANCEL GOT MENTIONED~!Â  HE SORTA STILL EXISTS.Â  Ever briefly, I hoped he might show up as a prosecution witness.Â  Why must you toy with my heart Game Of Thrones
Â 
Tommen recusing himself is a big LOL when his stand-in has an even bigger conflict of interest.Â  Hint #1 that this is going to be the show trial we all knew it would be.Â  Happy to see they kept in the gag where Oberyn sits up and gets really interested in Shae's testimony.
Â 
Liked Jaime's bargain.Â  Makes sense from him, and from Tywin.Â  Good explanation for why The Wall would be given to Tyrion as an option.
Â 
And then Peter Dinklage chewed the ever-living fuck out of the scenery.Â  
Â 
Shae's return is scoring really high with the unsullied, pretty big "OMG" moment for a lot of them, they were ready to feel Tyrion's outrage right along with him.Â  I loved the trial for that.Â  Every witness just stirs the pot of outrage and bullshit for the audience, even knowing it's coming it was still effective.Â  Helps that Meryn Trant is back to carry the "you look like a fooking ballsack" banner after Rast has fallen.Â  God, Trant is such a horrible shit.Â  Everybody, even the most minor of characters, is cast so well.Â

He is a Tyrell afterall, so even if Olenna considers him a dumb oaf, that doesn't mean he isn't a top tier schemer and underhanded politico. Once Tywin is out of the picture, we'll probably see more of that side of Mace.
709	Colonel Green	2014-05-11	Also, is moon door/Only Cat happening next episode???


Yeah.Â  On the one hand I kind of wish they hadn't put the Moon Door in the preview for the Unsullied, but on the other hand it saves us from spending a week debating whether it will be in the episode or not.
Â 
Also, with Sansa's ASOS story finished by the end of episode 7, that means the Vale lords will be appearing in episode 10 for some combination of AFFC Sansa I & Alayne I (investigating Lysa's death and introducing the Lords Declarant, though not necessarily the resolution of the matter).Â  At that pace, I can't see how Sansa doesn't have TWOW material in season 5.
Â 


Salladhor Saan.Â  By definition this is already a great episode.


I sometimes wonder if that guy won a contest guaranteeing him one scene per season.

710	Raksha 2014	2014-05-11	Excellent episode. Â 
Â 
Weaknesses:
Â 
1. Â Did Drogon barbecue the goat or the child, or both (i.e. whose bones did the farmer bring to show Daenerys)?
2. Â Ramsay porn. Â Boring. Â 
3. Â Two dogs. Â Run away, Ironborn!
Â 
Â 
Strengths:
Â 
1. Â Unexpectedly, Hizdahr (a virtual nonentity in the books); he's suddenly interesting. Â 
2. Â Mycroft Holmes (Mark Gatiss) as the Iron Banker.
3. Â Oberyn doing/saying whatever.
4. Â Theon as Reek.
5. Â Tyrion-Shae-Tywin-TYRION!!!! Â (oh wow, those last electrifying moments; Tyrion unleashed the anguish and anger of a lifetime of resentment and hurt)
Â 
Â 
I didn't want it to end.
711	MoIaF	2014-05-11	Really good episode. People will be raving about Dinklage but Alfie Allen is a phenomenal reek imo. Mace and Oberyn were both in fine form tonight along with Davos the legend

Oh yes, Alfie was excellent, definite props to him and his performance.  When TV Hizdahr said, "I pray you may never live to see a member of your family treated so cruelly," all I could think of was Viserys being killed by Drogo.
Â 
I kind of loved the scene with Dany smoothing over the goatherd matter and being all pleased with herself, only to be cut down to size by the confrontation with Hizdahr.

I don't think of Viserys, but yes, it's a good parallel. 
So, Hozface is suppose to be a sleazeball in the books, are they making him now into a sympathetic character?
712	King Tommen I	2014-05-11	Asha sure gave up quickly after blowing all that hot air.


Â 
I had the same exact thought....is that how it played out in the book??
713	Newstar	2014-05-11	You know who was tremendous in a spot I wasn't expecting?Â  HIZDHAR.Â  That dude knocked it out of the park and made Dany look (and feel) like a complete idiot in just a couple minutes.Â  That's putting on a "killing them with kindness" clinic.Â  Tremendous scene.Â  Barristan had a nice I-Told-You-So look, too.Â  That was a really great scene.
Â 
Loved it. I only know Joel Fry (Hizdahr) from his comedy work (Plebs, e.g.), but I agree, dude knocked it out of the park.
Â 
The whole Braavos side trip was worth it for Davos brandishing his maimed hand as proof of Stannis' honesty and reliability.
Â 
Hard to complain about more Salladhor. Actor kills it.

Yeah, I think you're right. Although I never really thought she had a season's worth of material after OnlyCat anyway.Â
715	Salad Days Saan	2014-05-11	I sometimes wonder if that guy won a contest guaranteeing him one scene per season.


Â 
Gemma Whelan won the same contest
716	El Guapo	2014-05-11	Oh yes, Alfie was excellent, definite props to him and his performance.
I don't think of Viserys, but yes, it's a good parallel.
So, Hozface is suppose to be a sleazeball in the books, are they making him now into a sympathetic character?


Â 
Well Dany is going to end up marrying him so I guess that could be the reason for the change.
717	Mark Antony	2014-05-11	I hope they make Salladhor stay loyal in the show  I mean the reason he leaves Stannis is money right?
718	Newstar	2014-05-11	Â 
Well Dany is going to end up marrying him so I guess that could be the reason for the change.


Â 
Except this change gives Hizdahr a good reason from day one to want Dany dead--that she had his father executed for no good reason--whereas in the books it was supposed to be at least something of a surprise that Hizdahr had it out for her.
Â 
...I wonder if the show writers realized that this change essentially makes Dany the Joffrey to Hizdahr's Robb. Oops.

Yeah, but that would negate the whole sacrificing theme if he's a "good guy".  No, I think there is going to be more to him.  We just had a tiny glimpse, the intrigue is about to start and Dany won't even realize it like in the books.
720	Obebb	2014-05-11	Excellent episode. Â

Â 
The child wasn't roasted, it was only the goat. Otherwise Dany would have freaked the hell out. I hope they add that eventually though.

722	TripleOZero	2014-05-11	Answers to all the forumer's questions:
1) It was definitely a goat, not the goat herder's son. The skull of the herder's son doesn't have horns. Perhaps the ribs were his son's, but it seems doubtful that he'd mix up the remains.
2) Littlefinger most definitely left Dontos in the rowboat and threw the necklace in there. The bay was locked down shortly thereafter. The Kings Landing Coast Guard (humor me) would have no trouble finding the rogue boat floating out in the bay. Hell, Littlefinger may have even tipped them off since it implicates Tyrion/Sansa and takes the blame away from him.
Â 
3) It makes no sense for Oberyn to volunteer to be champion at this point. He wants to kill the Mountain, but he hasn't been declared as Cersei's champion yet.
723	Darth Pipes	2014-05-11	Yeah, but that would negate the whole sacrificing theme if he's a "good guy". No, I think there is going to be more to him. We just had a tiny glimpse, the intrigue is about to start and Dany won't even realize it like in the books.


Â 
Yeah, I think so too.Â  This was an interesting revelation but I'm sure he's still a pretty shady guy.

Â 
That's true too. It will be interesting to see where they are going with it. Â If anything needs a little spicing up it is Dany's storyline.

Â 
Not by Hizdahr's attitude though. Seems quite a bit more respectful of her dubious authority than Robb was. I think they have time to frame it in a way to make it ambiguous. Ambiguity is what they really want to go for with whether Hizdahr had it out for her or not.Â

738	Northbound2.0	2014-05-11	Ah, so Drogon didn't barbecue the kid. HBO can't really show something like a child being killed on the show. Oh wait, they showed Arya killing a young boy and Lommey getting a blade run through his throat....
Yara/Asha is decent. Can't wait to see what Theon does at the Moat.
Trial was great! Peter D. you are the man. Well done.

The trial was quick, wasn't it?  It worked I thought.
Tyrion was channeling The Hound amirite? 
The Jaime-Tywin deal made sense even though Tyrion blew it up. 
I did not like Stannis on bended knee in Braavos bc I thought it worked better in the books, when the Iron Bank started looking for a way to recoup losses from loans to King Tommen.  
So do you think the battle at the wall will end with Stannis arriving - no peace negotiation? Or will he come even sooner? 
Opinion still out on Hizdahr changes.

Â 
Personally for me, this is what kept the episode from garnering a 10.
743	KP Woods	2014-05-11	People complaining about the Yara/Asha filler couldn't be more wrong. What if they did this arc just so when the Kingsmoot finally happens, it gives Yara all the more reason to declare herself the next Queen of the Iron Islands because "Theon" is "dead"?Â

The child wasn't roasted, it was only the goat. Otherwise Dany would have freaked the hell out. I hope they add that eventually though.


Â 
The bones included a goat's head, and if you watch the Drogon scene carefully, you can see that Drogon clearly flies over the child's head and roasts the fleeing goats well ahead of where the child is.

1. The bones were from the goat... you can clearly see horns on the skull. Hazzea, I think, will come next. That was just a preview to show that Daenerys is paying for the damages her dragons do;
2. It's HBO, so there will be porn... LOL;
3. The dog scene was very funny at first (c'mon, you kill a hundred man but can't kill two dogs?). But thinking again, I believe they left not because of the dogs, but because Asha/Yara saw what had become of Theon.

Â 
She wanted to take Theon back with her but she can't bring him back if he refuses to come with her and she wasn't going to throw her life or her men's lives away for him.Â  It was a commando raid, their advantage disappears once the alarm bells start ringing (you heard them, right) and the superior numbers of the Dreadfort Defenders overwhelm their position.
Â 
It is totally parallel with her trying to get him to retreat from Winterfell.Â  It's just hard to notice/remember when she only shows up once a season 
Â 
Does look like she cut and run without spelling out that explanation, I suppose.Â  But as I said earlier in the thread, we knew she could not achieve total victory and yet she could not take total defeat.Â  So we got what we got.

Peter Dinklage's Emmy episode for sure.
Â 
Am I the only one really surprised that Only Cat will be in 4x07 and not 4x10? I guess the episode title should have been a tipoff, but I sort of thought they would save that for the finale.


Â 
It wont be. There will likely be a lot of spacing for those scenes. The real debate should be this:
Â 
Does episode 10 end with which of these two quotes:
Â 
"Only Cat" or " "But the stink that filled the privy gave ample evidence that the oft-repeated jape about his father was just another lie. Lord Tywin Lannister did not, in the end, shit gold."
Â 
My bet is on the latterÂ  Â

Â 
- The drogon scene.
Â 
- Hizdahr was interesting.
Â 
- They put Shae in one of Sansa's old dresses.
Â 
- The whole trial was pretty well done.
Â 
- The Iron Bankers (besides their illogical choice to give Stannis money that early)
Â 
Dislikes:
Â 
- No Starks! Â Seriously, was there a single Stark anywhere?
Â 
- All the gratuitous boobs/ female nudity. Â 
I repeat this over and over, but it continues to bother me so I'll continue to point it out. Â We got to see some man boobs, but those were man-boobs of fully realized characters who had motivations beyond being sexual objects. Â In contrast, the sole defining character trait of all the nude women is 'wants the D'.
There's not even the semblance of balance.

773	gonkaos	2014-05-11	It seems like everyone's biggest complaint with the episode was the Greyjoy rescue scene. I'll admit, it truly, truly sucked! But, be happy folks. It's a good thing!!!!! Because it leads me to fully believe that................................
Â 
Â 
Â 
THE GREYJOY ARCS ARE BACK IN BUSINESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AT LEAST BIG V
Â 
Â 
But when is Balon going to die? FFS he should have died episode 1 
I KNOW RIGHT??? I think they're going to kill him in the last episode or even in the first episode of season 5 to kickstart the GREYJOYS arc
774	marsyao	2014-05-11	Â 
He only smashed one of the stones.


Â 
But he did not put it back to the boat.
775	Martini Sigil	2014-05-11	'twas kind of cool seeing bravos in the opening credits...
776	HokieStone	2014-05-11	Hmmm...Ramsay telling Theon that he needs to take a castle back from a bad man, and he needs his help...will they change it so that Theon is the one that kills Balon?
Â 
Also...in the preview, was that the Mountain we saw for a brief second (as some dude screamed for mercy)...and if so, is this actor #3 for that role?
777	rmholt	2014-05-11	Goddamn, that ending was awesome. I need a cigarette.

I have more of a blue b**l feeling, maybe like YarAsha. But for the same reason - great ending. 
I don't think there is any non XXX filler at least in DD s minds, and they prob think the XXX stuff is necessary too.
YarAsha I agree gave up the fight - but if Theon hadn't confirmed Balon's idea of what he was she might have put forth more of an effort.  
The most unbelievable part of that battle was the boat. Even the Ironborn could see you don't sail from the Iron Islands to the Dreadfort.
778	NightStark	2014-05-11	Hmmm...Ramsay telling Theon that he needs to take a castle back from a bad man, and he needs his help...will they change it so that Theon is the one that kills Balon?
Â 
Â 


Â 
He's dressing him up and sending him to Moat Cailin just as he does in the books.
Â 
You see shots of Theon in his armour in the trailer.

Yes, and yes he is the mountain and he is a rerecast
780	Florina Laufeyson	2014-05-11	Â 
I repeat this over and over

So stop. WeÂ get your social justice tangent. Please post it on tumblr where theres more sympathetic ears.Â 
Â 
Â 


Â 
Joffrey/Dany executed Robb/Hizdahr's father on a whim. Doubt that Hizdahr will go to war over it--openly, anyway--but it does not make Dany look good.


Thats the point. Dany needs to look bad cuz what she did is fucking bad. Certainly made me sympathize more with Hizdahr. Her BS can only go so far. It appears i was right. The show is likely to make the guys in Meereen look a little more rounded.
Â 


i cant fucking wait for snow castle and only cat im going to puke from excitement


OMG I KNOW RIGHT?!! *kermit flail*
781	Crimson Viper	2014-05-11	When I watched Dany's scene with Hizzie begging for his Dad's body all I could think was that I'd seen this before. It was almost straight out of the movie Troy where the King was begging for Hector's body. Hizzie all but kissed Dany's hand and cried. Great episode.
782	Stannis I	2014-05-11	Â 
No, Tywin is not that powerful, it is like President Obama tells Mr Biden" Hi, Briden, be a good man, go and make me a cup of coffe, will you?"


What?! Tywin Lannister is THE most powerfull man alive, both in the books and the TV show. Also, you cannot compare a rich and powerfull middle-age lord to a president in modern, republican and democratic country. He's more to Richellieu.
783	rmholt	2014-05-11	Hmmm...Ramsay telling Theon that he needs to take a castle back from a bad man, and he needs his help...will they change it so that Theon is the one that kills Balon?
Â 
?

Moat Cailin is in play. That's the castle - Roose has said
784	NightStark	2014-05-11	The most unbelievable part of that battle was the boat. Even the Ironborn could see you don't sail from the Iron Islands to the Dreadfort.


Â 
?
Â 
She sailed around Westeros then up the Weeping Water by rowboat to the Dreadfort
785	Stannis I	2014-05-11	Hmmm...Ramsay telling Theon that he needs to take a castle back from a bad man, and he needs his help...will they change it so that Theon is the one that kills Balon?
Â 
Also...in the preview, was that the Mountain we saw for a brief second (as some dude screamed for mercy)...and if so, is this actor #3 for that role?


He's talking about Moat Cailin.
786	TripleOZero	2014-05-11	Hmmm...Ramsay telling Theon that he needs to take a castle back from a bad man, and he needs his help...will they change it so that Theon is the one that kills Balon?

I know people get all ragey every time a change is made, but that would be a great twist. (The Moat Cailin guy is probably right though.)

She wanted to take Theon back with her but she can't bring him back if he refuses to come with her and she wasn't going to throw her life or her men's lives away for him.Â  It was a commando raid, their advantage disappears once the alarm bells start ringing (you heard them, right) and the superior numbers of the Dreadfort Defenders overwhelm their position.
Â 
It is totally parallel with her trying to get him to retreat from Winterfell.Â  It's just hard to notice/remember when she only shows up once a season 
Â 
Does look like she cut and run without spelling out that explanation, I suppose.Â  But as I said earlier in the thread, we knew she could not achieve total victory and yet she could not take total defeat.Â  So we got what we got.


i see what you are saying completely and im usually really very accepting with te TV show and overlook a lot...but i feel that by syaing "we got what we got" is not very fair since they knew what they were going to do with her for this season since they made the whole plan of "im saving my baby brother" of the season 3 finale...it felt really rushed...we didnt get any more info about the ironborn... they are lucky enough to get actors who dont complain about only beign in a few episodes and disappearing for a while (staying true to the books in that sense) but they do nothign with it... and like i said im usually very okay with what they do, but this is just yet another lazy mistep on their part...with the amount of screentime she got and is likely to get the rest of the season, we could of gotten more on balon and the iron islands and maybe found out about his death earlier on and introduce us a littlemore to the ironborn before next season (that is, if they will be adding balons brothres into the mix)Â 
I like the casting for yara, and i thinl alfie is doing great iwht theon, but i guess we will see if tye expand on what jus thappened...if they leave it at her just returnign to the iron islands and thats it, than i feel that was a big waste of time and not very realistic considering how far the iron isladns are from the dreadfort. Â
788	Dreams and Prophecies	2014-05-11	So i am guessing they are going to start with the snow castle? (Seeing as in the previous episodes, the last scene shown in the preview will be the first scene of the episode).
Â 
Then the intermediate scenes and cue to the final scene...well THAT.Â
789	Salad Days Saan	2014-05-11	But when is Balon going to die? FFS he should have died episode 1


Â 
No way, Balon winning the war of five kings by default by being the last one to die is The Greatest Joke Ever and it needs to continue
790	rmholt	2014-05-11	Â 
But he did not put it back to the boat.

Yes, he does.
791	King Zee	2014-05-11	Â 
But he did not put it back to the boat.


Â 
yes he did. you need to rewatch.
792	TeamLemonCakeBraavos	2014-05-11	SNOW CASTLEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!
Â
793	lostinwesteros	2014-05-11	Also, LOL at people saying that Tyrion's defiant YOLO speech is him finally going 'dark' and that his whitewashing has ended.Â  


 Â  Â  Â  Â Â Â I agree!
794	rmholt	2014-05-11	Â 
?
Â 
She sailed around Westeros then up the Weeping Water by rowboat to the Dreadfort

Well that's ridiculous. 
It didn't happen that way in the book and in the show it would still take less time to hike across Westeros. If they HAD to have a boat for cultural reasons they could have built one by hand and still saved time
JMHO!
795	MoIaF	2014-05-11	'twas kind of cool seeing bravos in the opening credits...

It kind of threw me off at first... I was like, what just happened.
796	Colonel Green	2014-05-11	(Seeing as in the previous episodes, the last scene shown in the preview will be the first scene of the episode).


The last scene shown in the recap, which we haven't seen yet.
797	Lord Godric	2014-05-11	He's talking about Moat Cailin.


It just seems odd, there has been no setup for this at all. Â
798	NightStark	2014-05-11	Well that's ridiculous.
It didn't happen that way in the book and in the show it would still take less time to hike across Westeros.

Â 
All the way across the North which is held by the Boltons?

Roose told Ramsay to take Moat Cailin and bring Theon.
800	rmholt	2014-05-11	Â

Small force, big country, no pirates.
Theon made it to Winterfell and his guy made it to Torrhens Square without boating around Westeros - my book reference. Of course he had learned some green ways.

SNOW CASTLEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!
Â 
 


OMG HNNNGH IM SO FREAKING OUT OVER THAT RIGHT NOW! We watched that preview and i shrieked with glee and was like "SNOOOWWW CASTLE!" My mum was all "wtf?" I told her that is a part of one of my favorite scenes in the series. I just hope they haveÂ some cool nostalgic voice overs for when she builds it.Â

OMG I KNOW RIGHT?!! *kermit flail*


Â 
honestly its my favorite scene in the whole series, i just remember dropping my book in shock when reading it. i was hoping it would make it to the finale but i dont even care, i just want to see it right now!!!
805	Lord Godric	2014-05-11	Roose told Ramsay to take Moat Cailin and bring Theon.


Weeks ago. I think the Unsullied will have no idea why that's significant at all.Â
806	Yanninho	2014-05-11	I bet Balon Greyjoy is drinking in Pyke to all the guys and gals killed in the show while they're still alive in the books, Just chillin' in the castle waiting for the storm to kill him.
Â 
And since Mockingbird is the Ep 7, I already figured out this was gonna be the 'Only Cat' episode.
Â 
Man, look likes <z have :
Â 
E07 : Only Cat
E08 : Oberyn vs Gregor
E09 : The Battle at the Wall
E10 : Tywin dyin' + UnCat
Â 
We can say for sure this end of season is gonna kill the Internet.

Â 
From what I've seen they picked up on it quite well.
809	Salad Days Saan	2014-05-11	Slight disappointment that Theon's protestations of being "Reek, always Reek" did not appear to include any rhymes.
Â 
Maybe next week, after his RP session is over
810	MyLittleDirewolf	2014-05-11	Yes! I'm very excited for that, it is such an amazing scene in the books.Â 


We need to have her rip the head off Sweetrobin's doll and put it on a spike too. Please!

I have a feeling getting him to a weirwood is going to be important.  Tho Dreadfort probably has several their significance is not yet clear.
I'm going to love the snow castle - though the High Heart witch dream isn't included I have hopes for as many of the other book parts they can wedge in. The whole ep could be that in a perfect world.

Yessir. I'm sure Ygritte will be dying in 9 as well. .Should be a hell of a final 4 episodes.Â 
Â 
I wonder who will take Donal Noyes place (please don't be Grenn  )
816	Queen Ayras Lord Commander	2014-05-11	I loved this episode, but was there a single aspect of it outside of the trial and more or less Dany's one scene that actually happened in the book? As I go through it scene by scene it's so different.
817	nara	2014-05-11	I kinda liked Stannis and the Iron Bank.Â  Nice set up for the future and makes more sense than a random Banker coming to the Wall to seek out Stannis.
Yara -- I was looking forward to this.Â  It's one of the book changes that I liked and I remember cheering when she said she was going for her brother.Â  I felt the scene was very anticlimactic and gave the appearance that she easily lost her resolve.Â  I get that she realized her brother was gone, but I thought they should have drawn out the fighting or shown them being attacked by the dogs.Â  I would have gladly traded the Ramsay sex scene or the Sallador Saan storytelling to flesh out the Ironborn scene.
Loved Alfie's acting as Reek.Â  I thought he nailed it.Â  However, as someone else mentioned, he looked too healthy.Â  Not sure what they could have done unless he pulled a Matthew McConaughey in Dallas Buyers Club stunt and lost a lot of weight.Â  However, I thought it was a makeup fail.
Dany scene.Â  I really liked the approach to Hizdahr, but I could have waited until next season for his introduction, because he lines came at the expense of Jorah and Barristan having any lines or plot.Â  Only thing is that I have a hard time believing that Dany would not want to marry him...I do hope they keep the part when the dragon eats a small child. That's an important moment for Dany
Trial -- LOVED IT.Â  Liked Jaime bargaining with Tywin.Â  This was a logical change given that they brought Jaime back so early (and he's had several interactions with his family).Â  Glad they kept Oberyn interested in Shae and Tyrion's sex life (that always amused me).Â  I have to say that the actress who played Shae looked very beautiful today and did a splendid job with her role.Â  Peter Dinklage was awesome too.Â  Is it just me or was his accent more normal in this episode and less affected?Â  The only thing that annoyed me was the continually close-ups of Margaery.Â  I get that she's an established actress and she has to be given screen time, but it felt odd to me to focus on her so much.Â
818	MyLittleDirewolf	2014-05-11	Anyone think Theon is going to meet up with Yara again at Moat Cailin? IDK, I have to think the Yara stuff was had some kind of purpose.
I'm really going to miss Oberyn. I hope he has a lot of scenes in the next episode. He was so good in this one. The way he sits, the way he talks. Yeah, the casting was on point.
819	TeamLemonCakeBraavos	2014-05-11	Â I just hope they haveÂ some cool nostalgic voice overs for when she builds it.Â 


Â 
I knowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!!! I hope they have Arya and Bran and the snowball thing. Voice-overs, Flashbacks, whatever.
820	SerJorahMormont	2014-05-11	Â 
OMG HNNNGH IM SO FREAKING OUT OVER THAT RIGHT NOW! We watched that preview and i shrieked with glee and was like "SNOOOWWW CASTLE!" My mum was all "wtf?" I told her that is a part of one of my favorite scenes in the series. I just hope they haveÂ some cool nostalgic voice overs for when she builds it.Â 



ive seriously never been more excited for a scene in game of thrones. i have such high expectations for next weeks episode its ridiculous
821	Rockroi	2014-05-11	The show begins its final ramp-up of the season.Â  Definitely better than the last two episodes, but â<U+0080>¦
Â 
What I liked:
Â 
Trials and Tribulations: The trial was incredible; extraordinarily well done and the highlight of the episode.Â  It took up about 20 minutes of the show so to have sych a long-run of extrodinary story is a very good thing. Â For those who know me from the board, they know I am actually a trial attorney and so I watched the episode with a different eye.Â  Watching the farce of the trial and how it was inflicted on the accused and how that accused did not have the knowledge necessary to fight back reminds me â<U+0080><U+0093> just a little â<U+0080><U+0093> of being in court when people represent themselves under the false belief that, well, if they could JUST talk to the judge, the judge â<U+0080><U+009C>would just know Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m innocent.â<U+0080><U+009D>Â  I hear that often and watching Tyrion get beaten up is reminiscent of that reality. Â Pretty much every aspect of the trial was well done, and I enjoyed the build.Â 
Â 
Other notes from the trial:
Â 
-Huge reveal that many of us already knew- namely that Tywin was never, ever going to allow Tyrion to die; he was always going to send him to the Wall.Â  But whatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s one last twist of the knife?
Â 
-Tyrionâ<U+0080><U+0099>s reaction to Shae was perfect, especially how- just like in the book- he takes his venom out on those he saved and how much he regrets it (mostly out of spite).Â 
Â 
-Jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s maneuver to keep his brother alive, once again, shows us how much this man loves his brother.Â  The things he does for love.Â  I also liked his interplay with Tywin and throwing at Tywin his own world-view.Â  After all, who wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t kill a King for a Lannister?Â 
Â 
Theon the Pale: While its clichA©, the showâ<U+0080><U+0099>s work on the Theon/Reak transformation has been fantastic.Â  This episode finally included Asha/Yaya and I thought that fear and rebellion against â<U+0080><U+009C>beforeâ<U+0080><U+009D> was executed flawlessly.Â  Watching Theon frantically resist rescue made me believe that sort of thing was possible.Â 
Â 
We Saw a Dragon: No, literally, thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s what qualifies for a good thing now that we are knee-deep in Post Storm-of-Swords GoT.Â 
Â 
What I am on the Fence About:
Â 
Name: Stannis Baratheon, 
Age: 42; 
Occupation: King of WesterosÂ 
Credit Score: 666 (but Rising): All things considered it was not a bad scene.Â  The Iron Bank was as single-minded as, I guess, we all would hope responsible banks WOULD be.Â  They laid out facts, not emotion and stuck Stannis where he lives: his small army, smaller holdings and 0-1 Battle Record since Robert was slain.Â  And Davosâ<U+0080><U+0099> impassioned response was Â excellent; well doneâ<U+0080>¦
Â 
.. .and I couldn't help but notice not delivered by Stannis.Â  Look, I GET IT, they donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t like Stannis- D&D have ruined the character and made it so heâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll likely liberate the Wall just as MAnce decides to take the Black and dedicate himself to World Peace.Â  Butâ<U+0080>¦ would have killed D&D to have â<U+0080>¦ you knowâ<U+0080>¦ STANNIS say something convincing?Â  Have him say what he is?Â  Maybe get him to â<U+0080>¦. Do something?Â  The annexation of all of Stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099> wit (Stannis Ultra-Dry), the loss of his realization, growth and decency; the removal of his leadership etc- it knows no bounds.Â  Now, in scenes that were not even IN the books, Stannis canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t be Stannis.Â  Now DAVOS has to be Stannis.Â 
Â 
Iron-Born: No Dogs Allowed: So, you raid this castle and you fight the the death in a gutty, dramatic battle, complete with huge pep talk at the start, you rush in and kill and die and make this huge incredible showing of determination and pride and bravery and courage and fucking balls-out heroism...Â 
Â 
.... but FUCK RUN! THEY HAVE DOGS!!!!!!! Â Really? Â Did... did that really happen? Â So... dogs make the Ironborn run? Â Is that a thing now? Â Really? Â 
Â 
-Boredom: Okay, I like how there is a tedium in being a dragon priestess and have to rule.Â  Ruling- as Robert told us â<U+0080><U+0093> can be very boring.Â  She conquered her territories, she now has to rule it. I also DID like the audience with the man who just wanted to bury his (horrifying, slave-owning father who had plenty of chances to do the right thing, but conveniently waited until there was an Army of Unsullied and Three Dragons up his ass before he filed his objection) father.Â  But havingaÂ  SCENE showing how boring things are â<U+0080>¦ tends to remind viewers just how â<U+0080>¦ BORING things are.Â  Boredom does not always make for good TV.Â 
Â 
What IÂ Didn'tÂ Like:
Â 
Starvation Feast: Its not really one thing; and in some ways maybe its not ANYTHING.Â  Butâ<U+0080>¦ weâ<U+0080><U+0099>re past the Red and Purple Weddings, we are closing in on the last big event of the books (The Battle of the Wall); soon the last major characters we actually watch will be gone, OR (far worse) thrown to the Seven Winds without rhyme or reason.Â  As the story grows more and more fragmented (not less and less) it will be harder and harder to tell this story.Â  As FfC takes up more space (and bores us all to death); as Dany does less, as we flicker from Dorne to the Iron Isles to Cersei being â<U+0080>¦ being all â<U+0080>¦ Cersei â<U+0080>¦ as these events take on less and less shapeâ<U+0080>¦
Â 
â<U+0080>¦ the most popular show on pay-cable TV is headed for a huge backlash.Â  And â<U+0080>¦ and if the Jaime-Cersei rape; if Bran at Crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s if this meandering at this slow pace â<U+0080>¦ if this is what we have to look forward toâ<U+0080>¦ Â as we get less and less â<U+0080><U+009C>original materialâ<U+0080><U+009D> and more and more untethered whimsiesâ<U+0080>¦ its harder and harder to see how this one is going to go. Â

823	Colonel Green	2014-05-11	Well that's ridiculous.
It didn't happen that way in the book and in the show it would still take less time to hike across Westeros.

829	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2014-05-11	The Onion Knight owned it once again. Really such a weak moment for Stannis himself but Davos will get it done for him.
830	SerJorahMormont	2014-05-11	I bet Balon Greyjoy is drinking in Pyke to all the guys and gals killed in the show while they're still alive in the books, Just chillin' in the castle waiting for the storm to kill him.
Â 
And since Mockingbird is the Ep 7, I already figured out this was gonna be the 'Only Cat' episode.
Â 
Man, look likes <z have :
Â 
E07 : Only Cat
E08 : Oberyn vs Gregor
E09 : The Battle at the Wall
E10 : Tywin dyin' + UnCat
Â 
We can say for sure this end of season is gonna kill the Internet.



those episode predictions sound about right. i think too much in one episode would overwhelm me and give me a heart attack
831	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-11	So are they simply excluding the part about the goat herder"s child and replacing it with goats? Or was that just a prelude to the child later being killed?

It's building up to that. That scene is solid episode 10 material, I think.
833	MoIaF	2014-05-11	So are they simply excluding the part about the goat herder"s child and replacing it with goats? Or was that just a prelude to the child later being killed?

I think it's a prelude, we'll most likely see the child die in the last episode "The Children".
834	nara	2014-05-11	So are they simply excluding the part about the goat herder"s child and replacing it with goats? Or was that just a prelude to the child later being killed?


Â 
In the books, the killing of livestock and Dany's payments came before the killing of a child.Â  It's an escalation of violence by the dragons OR maybe the same level of violence but perceived differently because a child cannot be replaced with gold.
835	Florina Laufeyson	2014-05-11	The Onion Knight owned it once again. Really such a weak moment for Stannis himself but Davos will get it done for him.


I think this is the moment. Cuz im pretty sure Stannis is a little more than bothered by people speaking for him. First Mel and now Davos? While hes ok with Davos speaking for him, i think it was visible that he was annoyed by it. Cuz he didnt have the stones to say this shit himself. So i think we might see Stannis start being more of a presence instead of Mr Brooding Guy. Prepping him for taking control of his own shit. Davos is likely to be shipped off to deal with the North guys anyway...

842	Yanninho	2014-05-11	The Yara scene was pretty meh, but since it gave me a real hope for a full Greyjoy focus (Balon's death, Victarion/Euron and Kingsmoot) in season 5, I'm glad we had it.
Â 
She will retreat to Moat Cailin, possibly learn about the death of her father. Kenning who will appear might say to her than Victarion has returned to Pyke and maybe (I hope) he will mention Euron's back. So she will leave too, possibly before Theon and Ramsay arrive and flay all the remaining Ironborns.
Â 
And I'm convinced that she didn't sail all around Westeros. Those were just barks, so my guess is she sailed from Iron Islands to Moat Cailin then took some others boats to attack the Dreadfort.

That was so obviously trying to fanservice. Like they kinda want us to get excited about Ramsay for some reason. They showed him getting tail and there was some female gaze involved. (Shot of his face and chest with a pan of his hands on butt. This is a lady fanservice move, but also including a blatant ass shot for the blokes.)

Could be, since they lost the perfect timing for that.
Although I don't believe Tywin would write to Daenerys directly, like in a "hey, wassup? I hope you remain in Mereen forever and don't bother me here. BTW, Jorah was my spy. Cheers".
Perhaps he's writting Ser Jorah and the letter gets intercepted...

875	Fat Trell	2014-05-11	Â 
Â 
Name: Stannis Baratheon, 
Age: 42; 
Occupation: King of WesterosÂ 
Credit Score: 666 (but Rising): All things considered it was not a bad scene.Â  The Iron Bank was as single-minded as, I guess, we all would hope responsible banks WOULD be.Â  They laid out facts, not emotion and stuck Stannis where he lives: his small army, smaller holdings and 0-1 Battle Record since Robert was slain.Â  And Davosâ<U+0080><U+0099> impassioned response was Â excellent; well doneâ<U+0080>¦
Â 
.. .and I couldn't help but notice not delivered by Stannis.Â  Look, I GET IT, they donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t like Stannis- D&D have ruined the character and made it so heâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll likely liberate the Wall just as MAnce decides to take the Black and dedicate himself to World Peace.Â  Butâ<U+0080>¦ would have killed D&D to have â<U+0080>¦ you knowâ<U+0080>¦ STANNIS say something convincing?Â  Have him say what he is?Â  Maybe get him to â<U+0080>¦. Do something?Â  The annexation of all of Stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099> wit (Stannis Ultra-Dry), the loss of his realization, growth and decency; the removal of his leadership etc- it knows no bounds.Â  Now, in scenes that were not even IN the books, Stannis canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t be Stannis.Â  Now DAVOS has to be Stannis.Â 
Â 


Â 
This would have been a perfect time to break out a modified version of Stannis' boast from tWoW.
Â 
Reinforcing the militancy of Stannis, in a military sense, helps to balance out the militancy of him in a religious sense. Even if it doesn't make him likeable, it makes him competent.
Â 
Stannis' spartan ways and quick action needs to provide a contrast of the decadence of Dany in Meereen and the insanity of Cersei in KL.

Seriously. Theres so much Aegon foreshadowing going on during the Varys bits, its kinda mad. Aegon being cut would neuter next season onward. Of course they are including him. Hes Varys' primary motive. Varys' looking at the throne tonight was basically "yeah im going to put an ass in that."

She ultimately can't save Theon if Theon is unwilling to save himself.Â  She'd just be throwing her life and her men's lives away for nothing (yes, even more so than the men she already lost during the raid.Â  Sunk Costs Fallacy, etc.)

Again, from a narrative standpoint we knew she couldn't rescue Theon yet also could not get captured by Ramsay, so the show had to bullshit their way out of that dilemma and did about the best they could.Â  Now, you can criticize the producers putting themselves in that spot in the first place (and that's fair game), but when you already are painted into a corner you not getting out of it without a colorful footprint or two.

890	lil_z	2014-05-11	Just saw it, better late than never. Everything was aces, especially the trial, but I just have to let it of my chest...
Â 
WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT YARA SCENE! YOU THROW AXES FOR A LIVING, YOU'VE GOT A KID WHO'S AN AXE, AND THAT FUCKING RAMSEY IS STANDING THERE AND YOU FUCKING RUN AWAY LIKE FUCKING SWIPER FROM DORA THE EXPLORER! NO ONE UNDERSTANDS!
Â 
Uff...that felt so good. Anyway, was that trial awesome or what?


I agree, and not to mention this thought is already brought to light in Season three when Theon's father declares him "no son of mine," when he recieved the package of Theon's naughty bits. Not sure on the direct quote. It seemed like added fluf, or perhaps just to remind the viewers that Asha and the Iron Born are still around.
891	marsyao	2014-05-11	That end scene with Tyrion was a ploughing masterpiece.Â 


Â 
I agree, the only thing I regret not in the secne is "He made me call him big lion"
892	go joff go	2014-05-11	Favourite comment about the episode so far, from the AV Club commenters' thread:
Â 
(About Tyrion's speech): "That was some real wrestling villain talk, right down to the crowd booing."
Â 
Laughing forever. It's funny because it's true.lol wait until tyrion and all his little bronn-a-maniacs run over you. Oh yeah
893	redriver	2014-05-11	Â 
But he did not put it back to the boat.


Will you kindly stop chatting shit.He smashed one stone of the necklace and threw the rest of it into the boat with Dontos.
Â 
Why do you make these unequivocal comments when it's obvious you either haven't seen the recent episodes or your memory has more holes than a Swiss cheese?
894	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-11	Seriously. Theres so much Aegon foreshadowing going on during the Varys bits, its kinda mad. Aegon being cut would neuter next season onward. Of course they are including him. Hes Varys' primary motive. Varys' looking at the throne tonight was basically "yeah im going to put an ass in that."
Â 


Yeah not only did that convince me he was in the show, but also that he will end up sitting the IT for a time in the series.Â
895	Salad Days Saan	2014-05-11	Seriously. Theres so much Aegon foreshadowing going on during the Varys bits, its kinda mad. Aegon being cut would neuter next season onward. Of course they are including him. Hes Varys' primary motive. Varys' looking at the throne tonight was basically "yeah im going to put an ass in that."
Â 
I dunno...eeeee..sounds like shes spiteful and jealous.Â 


Â 
Also, this is the one time the actress' wooden delivery is actually an advantage 
Â 
"oh hey, this speech sounds like rehearsed/coached bullshit for some reason..."
896	JonDunn	2014-05-11	I
Â think they'll have him turn up later out of the blue with a bag..Dany and the non readers will think 'Ah, goat man again..just pay him his silvers', then we'll have the bones revealed as a child.


Â 
Â 
Good thought. Â I hope so
897	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-11	Oberyn said that Varys should meet Ellaria in the brothel. That's wrong, HBO. Does she lives there already?
898	~No One~	2014-05-11	I really enjoyed the 'Jorah was our spy' shout out. Betrayal happening in 3-2-1....
899	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-05-11	Â 
She ultimately can't save Theon if Theon is unwilling to save himself.Â  She'd just be throwing her life and her men's lives away for nothing (yes, even more so than the men she already lost during the raid.Â  Sunk Costs Fallacy, etc.)
Â 
Just like when she tried to get him to retreat from Winterfell.

Â 
Yeah, you're right, whoever came up with the idea last season to send Yara to this rescue mission wrote himself into a corner and Cogman pretty much had to play catch on this episode and do the best he could to walk out from that mess
Â 
But the execution was what really irked me. Like, we could have at least seen the Ironborn fighting their way out of the castle or something, but that cut was all kinds of lame, reminded me of Mr. Burns setting his dogs on people
900	Salad Days Saan	2014-05-11	Oh LOL I just remembered how when Ramsay is making Reek strip for his bath, "britches too" Ramsay totally lowers his head and shoots a look down there and has the sloppiest grin on his face.
Â 
Ramsay you complete bastard
901	JonDunn	2014-05-11	IT's not JUST the dogs, the rest of the Dreadfort men were coming too.
Â 
Â 
You people wanted Yara to do a suicide mission to save someone that bit her.
Â 
Â 
Yara is smarter than you.Â
902	King Tommen I	2014-05-11	Â 
Â 
Â 
It's not running away scared.
Â 
It's that she realized there was absolutely NO reason to fight anymore, Theon Greyjoy is dead.
Â 
Â 
Â 
SMH at some of you who don't get this.Â 


Â 
SMH at some of you who don't get it....the scene was terribly directed and/or not nearly developed enough. Â Made her look like "oh well, we tried, but...dogs....RUN!!"
903	The Warlock Mooreflo	2014-05-11	this
Â 
dafaq was up with that convo with Varys and Oberyn?
Â 
Watching with my unsullied father, and he had to pause it to ask what Varys agenda was. Honestly couldn't answer him. (I don't give him spoilers, just aid in understanding what we show watchersÂ know) Just said his agenda is stayin' alive in Kings Landing (And again after he put a knife in Tyrion's back)
Â 
...more I think about it I not sure. Wasn't Varys in league with Magister Illyrio? Who was backing Dany?? ARGH All my brainblood in in my boner from the boobies I cannot think!
Â 
Nah for real, how do I explain Varys to my unsullied pops with out giving spoilers/theories?
904	Gertrude	2014-05-11	It's not that I minded Shae turning all spiteful against Tyrion, it's that the show runners knew this was going to be the end result and decided to make Shae all 'I'd kill to protect that girl' over Sansa. You can make Shae kindly towards Sansa, but there was no reason to make a huge point of it. The inconsistency just stuck out like a sore thumb.
905	King Tommen I	2014-05-11	IT's not JUST the dogs, the rest of the Dreadfort men were coming too.

Â 
People defending that scene as well done are exposing themselves as blind D&D kool-aid drinkers imo.
906	IlAovatar	2014-05-11	I'm shocked at how bad that episode was. Really, it must be one of the best examples yet of why they should stick to the damn books instead of fulfilling some fanfic fantasy. They're clearly too incompetent as writers to do the series justice by making stuff up as they go along.

Nope, same as seasons 1, 2 and 3.
913	PhoenixFlame	2014-05-11	I was disappointed Zero Dark Greyjoy ended so mutedly...but the Reek and Ramsay bath scene was awesome. Holy crap. Ramsay looks the softest he's ever been (lighting and wardrobe) and yet the scene has more nervy tension than ever. Alfie Allen sold Reek's terror and disbelief. Rheon is always awesome at eye acting. So. Effin. Creeptastic.Â 
Â 
Holy shit where did Hizdahr come from? This dude is awesome! I loved how Dany was all "eheehe, I am a wise ruler, look at the little peasant man scamper off!" Hizdahr pwned that smug look right off. I barely registered this guy in the books. I think we might have another Bronn?
Â 
I liked Tywin's raw deal too. He seemed to imply he was never going to execute Tyrion in the first place, and Jaime bargained himself away to Casterly Rock. Mini-awesome acting moment--Dance's expression when Jaime told him about Aerys' last order.
Â 
Oh, the pained looks of EVERYONE when Pycelle spoke of the "noblest boy the gods ever put on this earth." Ahahaha the day Pycelle lied too much.Â

Ehh actually,Â it sounded restrained but when Shae turns to face Tyrion and says "i was his whore." it sounded like decent delivery. Shes spiteful as fuck. She probably didnt want to be a witness and was told to be, but while she was there, she was going to throw that into his face.
Â 


Oberyn said that Varys should meet Ellaria in the brothel. That's wrong, HBO. Does she lives there already?


Ellaria is sniffing out intel. Even my mum picked up on that. In the showverse, the whores hear all the gossip.
Â

I think this is actually supposed to look like Shae was coerced in saying that shit about Sansa. Cuz she liked Sansa so much, it would make viewers ponder whether or not she was being forced to say something. But i actually do think there was spite there because Tyrion wanted to stop banging Shae in order to make the marriage work. (she wanted to be in Sansa's place.)

You're in the minority. The votes on this site say so, and the fact that this is HBOs most watched series EVER is further proof.Â
917	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-11	I'll stop reminding you that we're watching a sexist dudebro adaptation when HBO stops reminding me.HBO? And reading the books didn't ring your bells about sexism in Westeros? When daughters AND sons are forced to marry against their will? When in the Riverruns pretty much every girl has been raped, or so said Jaime? When Randyll Tarly says that Brienne could learn to behave like a proper lady after a good old rape?I get it. Women being treated like objects offend people. But in Westeros, women were treated like properties. And, in many societies, they still are (#BringBackOurGirls, anyone?). This reminded me of those idiots who whined and whined about taking down the part of my national anthem that says we were slaves because it wasn't true. It was true and now people think it's not and someone wrote down those lyrics because it simply was feeling creative and with low self-esteem. Hiding how women were treated in history because it hurt susceptibilities doesn't do anybody a favour: it's the other way around. There were no Talisas in middle ages saying "uuuh, your world is barbaric!". they were given the barbaric treatment.

919	JonDunn	2014-05-11	I understand that Yara's exit should have been filmed better. Â  It was an awkward cut. Â But I get what they were going for. Â  The purpose of the scene came through with what came after with Reek/Ramsay.
Â 
My biggest problem with the episode was Emilia's bad acting.
Â 
Hizdhar was much better than he ever was in ADWD though.Â

Wow. While the story differs I think it is a great adaption. Adaption being the operative word there. ASOIAF could never be made into a television series or movie with out changes for SO many reason. Literally too many reasons to list, but the main one being that there are WAY too many characters in the books to fit into a screen adaption. 
Is it still considered fanfic if the author is an executive producer?

I doubt if his father spoke out against the stuff he said at all. He's just coming in with a sob story because he's probably heard that the new queen always buys sob stories. We saw that with the goatherd.
Â 
Great episode. I really liked the way they translated the trial scene into the show. It lost some things but preserved the key essence, while adding others, like Margaery's reactions to the proceedings, knowing what we know about her insight into the truth of the matter.

Â 
JA! It doesn't matter if he was lying or not, he was making valid arguments and pointing out how Dany's form of justice was shortsighted and emotional. Personally I don't think he was totally lying, even if he was playing up the grieving son angle. That's just persuasive speech tactics.Â

934	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-11	I agree that popularity doesn't equal quality but this time, this episode was very good.
935	Jasta11	2014-05-11	Best episode of the season so far, after two fairly slow ones. Started a bit weak, ended on a tremendous note.
Â 
-Braavos looks awesome, and has the best representation in the opening credits. Davos was awesome, as was Saan. But Stannis himself said too little. He seemed to just give up, and Davos had to save his ass. Really, Stannis, give up? I know the showrunners don't really like him, but whenever you appreciate the man or not, ''giving up'' is just not part of his friggin vocabulary.
Â 
-The Dreadfort scene was lamer than I thought it would be. It starts all badass with Yara making an awesome speech and sneaking all ninjaviking like in the Bolton's home turf, only to be twarted by shirtless Ramsay (against armored raiders with shields? Come on...) and his two dogs. I get that Yara thought Theon was gone, but just running for the hills without even trying to kill the asshole who did this to her lil bro seems almost cowardly. On the other hand, awesome acting by Theon and Ramsay's actors.
Â 
-Dany finally gets a scene where she doesn't end with a smug smile on her face and gets called on her shit. It seems the show has resolve to round out Meereen a bit and really showcase how perfect little Khalessi isin't adored by absolutely everyone. About time.
Â 
-Small Council meetings are always gold. I loved Oberyn chilling in his chair while the others jumped up at the mere scent of Tywin. And Jorah is totally getting ratted out by Lord Lannister.
Â 
-Varys bringing on the Aegon foeshadowing big time. His actor is really good and the Spider needed screen time badly. Me likes.
Â 
-The trial; almost perfect. It only required the 'giant of Lannister'' line. Hell, I think they made Tywin smarter than in the books with his trap to Jaime, it's a fairly elegant way to sort out the mess honestly. But of couse Tywin just had to twist the knife with Shae and ruin his own plan by getting Tyrion royally pissed off. Also loved the Tyrion-Jaime exchanges and the worried, unsure looks on the Kingslayer's face as the trial goes on. And of course Peter Dinklage nails the epic final speech as I 100% knew he would. About time he shows some anger too.
936	Florina Laufeyson	2014-05-11	HBO? And reading the books didn't ring your bells about sexism in Westeros? When daughters AND sons are forced to marry against their will?

Â Its the reason why the characters that are female we have are so great. Asha doesnt put up with shit, Ellaria is milking it to gather intel, Sansa stands her ground (and is building a fucking snow castle goddammit!). Lysa gets what she wants (at her own expense), Cersei uses the system and manipulates it to put her babies on the throne. The babies she wanted. Arya faces a bleak reality and has to cope with that. Ygritte fights for the freedom of her and her people. Dany tests the waters to rule and faces challenges by trying to overturn a bad system. Brienne makes her own way for her own honor. Melisandre wants to save the world in the name of her god. These girls are making waves and the contrast has to be made for them to do so. If it offends people,Â i have to ask if we even have seen and read the same series. The bleating....im tired of it.Â

I get it. Women being treated like objects offend people. But in Westeros, women were treated like properties.


There's a difference between women being treated like objects in Westeros and the show itself treating women like sex objects, as well as using rape as flippantly as many people feel they have been -- the latter point is up for debate, the former really isn't.Â  The show is full of female flesh that serves no purpose whatsoever other than objectifying the women for the presumed viewing pleasure of the audience.

No clue. That was part of the reason I thought Only Cat might be delayed until 4x10, since the show hasn't introduced a patsy yet and there's no Marillion.

Someone suggested using Mord, which would be an elegant solution, but I don't even know if that actor's back for Season 4.

Dorne supporting Aegon. They don't like to keep anything off screen for too long or to blind side the audience.
It's probably why they had Yara attack the dreadfort too. I thought the Ironbank scene was very good and the shot
of the Titan of bravos looked perfect and the overview of Bravos looked cool. I wish I could use Google streetview on it.
946	IlAovatar	2014-05-11	seriously. If you hate something like this adaptation, why are you watching it? There are readers of the series who have chosen not to watch the show and by proxy, they wont bitch about it. It would be a good idea to take a leaf from them so those of us enjoying ourselvesÂ dont have to hear this noise.Â 


Did I say that I hate the whole series?
Â 
I've enjoyed it a lot for the most part, even though the deviations from the books seem to be getting progressively worse with each season. There have been episodes that have left me disappointed or underwhelmed by certain scenes, but this is the first episode to rub me the wrong way so much that i'd go as far as to say I hated it.
947	Zman1863	2014-05-11	Hi guys.
Â 
Idk if this has been brought up yet (just signed up), but does anyone have a clue how they are going to pull off the moondoor situation? Because they've shown no hints of a singer so far at the Eyrie, and the show has already disposed of Marillion sooo...


Â 
I guess they'll think of some way to tweak it without upsetting it in its essentials. I don't think they've done too bad in the Eyrie thus far so we'll have to see.Â
948	Jasta11	2014-05-11	Seeing shirtless Theon was so depressing to me. Even after he's being flayed, tortured, castrated and malnourished he has a better body than meÂ 
Â 
Guess he took a page out of the Jennifer Lawrence "Don't go anorexic for a role" book, which I applaud, actually


Â 
Ah, word, I was actually thinking that for a guy who has spent months in a dungeon being tortured, he looks pretty cut. Still not a big deal, the acting is far more important than the appearance and he nails it.
949	When Harry met Sansa	2014-05-11	Thought the adaptation tonight was pretty great. This was one of the best episodes of the season and one of the more memorable ones period, IMO.
Â 
I'm not all torn up over the fan-fic stuff here; Stannis personally being in Braavos didn't bug me. Neither did Jaime's commitment to Tyrion during the trial and the deal he accepts. The reality of that scene is that it kills two birds with one stone; it helps both sullied and unsullied hop back aboard the Kingslayer's Redemption that was slightly derailed with the Cersei-rape moreÂ easily and sets the stage for the breakout in Ep. 10. Plus how great was the start of #DarkTyrion tonight? Finally Dinklage gets to bring some gray back to the character and he really nailed that scene.Â 
Â 
Somebody already mentioned it as well but the bath scene between Theon and Ramsay was pretty great; unbelievable acting and camera direction to make the simplest scene of normal human decency ridiculous ripe with tension. Plus that smile on Ramsay's face when he looks "down there" absolutely killed me.Â
950	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-11	There's a difference between women being treated like objects in Westeros and the show itself treating women like sex objects, as well as using rape as flippantly as many people feel they have been -- the latter point is up for debate, the former really isn't.Â  The show is full of female flesh that serves no purpose whatsoever other than objectifying the women for the presumed viewing pleasure of the audience.The use of women in the show as simply objects for the men's pleasure is as real as the violence and butchery we see during battles. Yes, it appeals men but it's not like they're inventing such treatment.
951	rmholt	2014-05-11	I'm a clueless chump and saw the preview but I really was teased along by the Enter the Dragon goatherd scene...wth are they staring at? Oh, yeah...Well done bit.

Â 
Varys really threw me off a bit this week. What the hell DOES he want? He looks at the throne like he was interested in it, but we know that isn't true.Â  (I know the good of the realm, but with who running it?) Again I guess thats ok since I still am not sold on exactly what book Varys wants either.
953	Lady Beyond the Wall	2014-05-11	Â Its the reason why the characters that are female we have are so great. Asha doesnt put up with shit, Ellaria is milking it to gather intel, Sansa stands her ground (and is building a fucking snow castle goddammit!). Lysa gets what she wants (at her own expense), Cersei uses the system and manipulates it to put her babies on the throne. The babies she wanted. Arya faces a bleak reality and has to cope with that. Ygritte fights for the freedom of her and her people. Dany tests the waters to rule and faces challenges by trying to overturn a bad system. Brienne makes her own way for her own honor. Melisandre wants to save the world in the name of her god. These girls are making waves and the contrast has to be made for them to do so. If it offends people,Â i have to ask if we even have seen and read the same series. The bleating....im tired of it.Â

And this..."The babies she wanted." is of course, Cersei's biggest triumphant manipulation of the system!  
Â 
No clue. That was part of the reason I thought Only Cat might be delayed until 4x10, since the show hasn't introduced a patsy yet and there's no Marillion.
Â 
Someone suggested using Mord, which would be an elegant solution, but I don't even know if that actor's back for Season 4.
Â 
It could just be some random guard.

Personally I think that there won't be a witness. It will just be Sansa and Baelish. This is my guess for the last scene this season. Bye bye Lysa.
954	greensleeves	2014-05-11	Oh for the love of...GO AWAY! Im notÂ uncomfortable. Im tired of theÂ whinging! If you dont like what you are seeing, stop feeding the pig by watching it! Armchair Activists. fucking lol

There's a difference between women being treated like objects in Westeros and the show itself treating women like sex objects, as well as using rape as flippantly as many people feel they have been -- the latter point is up for debate, the former really isn't.Â  The show is full of female flesh that serves no purpose whatsoever other than objectifying the women for the presumed viewing pleasure of the audience.

No, if the point was to critique the society, they wouldn't be using parades of nude women purely as eye candy.
956	Florina Laufeyson	2014-05-12	Stunned by the number of people who think there was any serious amount of sincerity in anything that Hizdahr said. I doubt if his father spoke out against the stuff he said at all. He's just coming in with a sob story because he's probably heard that the new queen always buys sob stories. We saw that with the goatherd.
Â 
Great episode. I really liked the way they translated the trial scene into the show. It lost some things but preserved the key essence, while adding others, like Margaery's reactions to the proceedings, knowing what we know about her insight into the truth of the matter.


Â 
Hizdahr is likely bullshitting, yes, but if he is, it means hes not a fucking mustache twirling moron, but understands how to manipulate her. And thatsÂ awesome. It made me root for him a bit. I cant wait for the Harpy subplot. Plus he dropped the Graces so yes. Green Grace is a go! Hnngh!

Ramsay half naked was also fanservice.
957	Mark Antony	2014-05-12	I've actually been fairly tolerant of a lot of the changes they've made to the series up until now. Tonight's episode just made me cringe though. Repeatedly.


Weird i'm the complete opposite. A lot of the changes in previous episodes have pissed me off but I didn't really have any problems tonight. Stannis and Davos in Braavos was great. Jaime/Tywins deal made perfect sense. I also really like Hizhahrs scene. Only thing that was meh was the Yara/Ramsay fight but Alfie Allens acting pretty much saved the scene for me.Â
958	PhoenixFlame	2014-05-12	I've only seen the episode once, but I took Stannis' quietness at the bank to be more "I am so done with this bullshit this was a bad idea from the start" more than giving up. Davos, otoh, understands Braavos and told Mycroft to shut the fuck up. The power of bromance triumphedÂ  
Â 
...or Davos said "Stannis, for the love of god, let me do most of the talking."

959	Grail King	2014-05-12	Excellent episode. Â 
Â 
Weaknesses:
Â 
1. Â Did Drogon barbecue the goat or the child, or both (i.e. whose bones did the farmer bring to show Daenerys)?
2. Â Ramsay porn. Â Boring. Â 
3. Â Two dogs. Â Run away, Ironborn!
Â 
Â 
Strengths:
Â 
1. Â Unexpectedly, Hizdahr (a virtual nonentity in the books); he's suddenly interesting. Â 
2. Â Mycroft Holmes (Mark Gatiss) as the Iron Banker.
3. Â Oberyn doing/saying whatever.
4. Â Theon as Reek.
5. Â Tyrion-Shae-Tywin-TYRION!!!! Â (oh wow, those last electrifying moments; Tyrion unleashed the anguish and anger of a lifetime of resentment and hurt)
Â 
Â 
I didn't want it to end.


Someone may already answered since I'm on pg 15, but looks like a goat and the herder said goat, look at the skull it had horns.
960	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-12	Ramsay half naked was also fanservice.And Loras/Renly, and Oberyn/Ellaria/PeopleFromTheONlyBrothelInKL, and Loras/WhatHisName...
961	Mladen	2014-05-12	This one was good... Like really good.
Â 
What I like the most is in fact that Tyrion has finally returned. St. Tyrion was gone, and good old Tyrion was back in the game. And guess what, we loved it every single moment of it. After painfully long time, after whitewashing of every single interaction he had throughout last and this season, Tyrion was brilliantly Tyrion. I enjoyed in Tyrion this episode more than I have enjoyed him in quite some time... Well job
Â 
Oberyn, as usual, lights every room he is in. He brings such great chemistry. My favorite this year. Love him...
Â 
On the opposite side, WTF Stannis and even more WTF Mace? Once again, HBO proves not to be neither brilliant nor terrible.
Â 
Lastly, Theon and Asha. This one was rather nice. Not my favorite, but good enough
Â 
The worst: Daenerys. Pardon me for saying this, but I wanted that child to burn, I wanted her to face some real challenges. Hizdahr's speech was nice, for it pointed out the injustice of the great justice. Never mind that most likely he is lying, thing is it is pointed out. I wish it was something Daenerys truly noted. This could have been done better.

Â 
Yeah, come on... One of the most beautiful scenes in ASOIAF has had to be adapted...
Â 
As for dragon, I genuinely thought it will burn a child. It would have brought such nice dimension to rather linear season of Daenerys. I wish they went with it, for I would truly love to see show Danerys' world shaken in order to see something other than "warrior princess" mode.
Â 
As for fandom, Flo, don't be upset... I watch because I want. When it is good, I don't hide my excitement, when it is bad, I am open about it. Not everything is black as it isn't white...

Who successfully laid what? If that siege can be considered success, I don't know what can't. And, back then, Baratheons certainly weren't second most powerful House.

That child will definitely burn. Does anyone think we won't see this exact same goatherd dude again when the child dies? Tonight was just foreshadowing for when he brings in that child's bones, most likely in Ep. 10 regardless of if you think "The Children" means Dany's dragons or the Children of the Forest (I'm personally hoping it means the latter but who the fuck cares).Â

Davos needed to do the speaking there because he is pleading for his life, not just the gold when he's speaking there. Think of it like a head coach who needs to win a playoff series to keep his job. Only difference is when you play the Game of Thrones you win or you die, not get fired and then have to sign with Golden State...

973	Stark11	2014-05-12	Jeez the hate for the Iron Born running away from "two dogs" if pretty harsh. Â If I'm correct there were 3 Iron Born when Ramsey unlocked the cages with "two dogs" (I'm sure he has more although we have only seen two, i'll give you that). Yes they could have tried and probably succeed in killing this dogs (which wouldn't have been a very quick and easy task) but then you have Ramsey and his men on you at the same time, they do this they are definitely dead. Â Running away = a very smart decision. I just don't see where the hate is coming from in that decision, it's called being smart. Â 
Â 
I'll say this, I haven't complained about one deviation from the book yet because I understand this is an adaption of the book and they can't keep everything exactly how it is so I love the show. However I do think this deviation was kind of bad since it lasted about 5 minutes but it did give us some future plot points. (Yara "thinking" Theon is dead and Theon going into Moat Cailin) It just seemed rushed and there could have been more of a battle that in-sued between the two sides. Â I find it hard to believe in a castle full of Bolton's that only 7 or 8 managed to take actin. Alfie Allens action was top notch though, loved him. Â

I do hope for the return of Kevan Lannister, and we will have Qyburn. Maybe that will be all, but I hope for a possibly merged Rowan/Redwyne Tyrell bannerman, even though I doubt it.
984	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-05-12	Bruhs, no Mace Tyrell slander in here. The man's a saint. http://asoiaf.wester...dpost&p=5530699


Â 
Exactly. I will not suffer this blasphemies here. This not King's Landing. And Mace is a fooking legend, and y'all know it. The Hand Throne will be the highlight of the entire show, you'll see
Â 
Also, someone on FB just said that he was waiting for the Soup Nazi to declare against Tyrion too, and I can't stop laughing about it
985	T.C	2014-05-12	By far the 2nd best episode in the series. Poor Tyrion.
Â 
I think his new found anger is a perfect lead up to what's going to happen at the end of the series.
986	Salad Days Saan	2014-05-12	Â 
Yeah, everyone in Westeros thinks Mace is a fool except Mace. His main redeeming moment is 
	Spoiler ordering Tarly to march into KL with an army to bail out Margaery.



Â 
Mace IS a shameless kissass.
Â 
Early in ASOS when Tywin shows up to be hand and Sort Out Business (including 'shipping Cersei/Balon LOL) Mace is Robin Quivers to Tywin's Howard Stern, laughing loudest at his jokes and praising his every suggestion as brilliant.
Â 
It's how Lord Oaf rolls
987	Florina Laufeyson	2014-05-12	Â 
turned?
Â

RIGHT?
Mace has always been an oaf. Always. Hes just gr9.Â 
Â 
Oh yeah.

	Spoiler 
Snowcastle. I CANT WAIT! Kermit mode activated. Sansa getting pushed at the Moon Door...and her freaking out. Omg next episode is gonna rule! Unf! Theres that joy again. 


Â 
Stannis in the Bay Area. Now theres a thought...

LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
988	TeamLemonCakeBraavos	2014-05-12	Â 
No clue. That was part of the reason I thought Only Cat might be delayed until 4x10, since the show hasn't introduced a patsy yet and there's no Marillion.
Â 
Someone suggested using Mord, which would be an elegant solution, but I don't even know if that actor's back for Season 4.
Â 
It could just be some random guard.


Â 
Serious question (of the purely speculative sort): How MUCH changes if they have Sansa throw Lysa out of the Moon Door herself? I mean, I know A LOT would change if they did that, but would it necessarily be "all" bad? I'm 99% sure they WON'T have Sansa kill Lysa herself, but with the lack of Marillion, the thought has crossed my mind more than once in the past week. Would that destroy Sansa's character completely, or would it simply usher in not only the "partnership" aspect of Petyr and Sansa's relationship (i.e. I cover your murders, you cover mine), but also the 'hardening' of Sansa herself? This is a purely "what-if" question, but I've wanted to ask someone for a while now (figured I'd ask you since you brought up Marillion).
Â 
Anyways, I think with the lack of Marillion, they're simply going to have Sansa and Petyr conspire to say that she was drunk and fell out of the Moon Door by herself.
989	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-05-12	H-dog tossin' them feels at Dany.
Â 
Stannis seemed like a different man this episode. His douche-factor's been turned down. Also, love that they're givin' Davos more screen-time and they're not downplaying his intelligence. He's truly a great negotiator.
Â 
And I lol'd at how trashy the Iron Born were. Ramsay was trolling 'em like nothin', without a shirt on, stabbin' 'em with a butter knife. C'mon, man up.
Â 
Love how Oberyn didn't get up when Tywin walked in unlike those tools.Â 
Â 
Fuck Trant. And where the hell is Balon Swann - the only decent Kingsguard member?
Â 
Trial was epic. I'm really glad they executed it so well. Everyone did a superb job.
990	Mladen	2014-05-12	That child will definitely burn. Does anyone think we won't see this exact same goatherd dude again when the child dies? Tonight was just foreshadowing for when he brings in that child's bones, most likely in Ep. 10 regardless of if you think "The Children" means Dany's dragons or the Children of the Forest (I'm personally hoping it means the latter but who the fuck cares).Â 
Â 

Â 

Well someone mentioned they were probably setting up for Hazzea and i really hope thats the case. Otherwise, its ridiculous whitewashing.Â 
Â 

Â 
I would agree with Florina... If it sets up for Hazzea nice, if don't, I am officially pissed

Â 

The Nitpick With Impunity thread is coming. I freaking made it this time. I just wish we could have a joyful discussion without some SJW throwing a tantrum and people saying people who liked this episode are sexist or just have bad taste.Â 
Â 
Â 

Oh, God... We can't say a word and not turn out to be either sexist, racist or whatever is the flavor of the week.
Â 
Â 
Â 


Â 
Thanks!
Â 
Well it was a success until it was lifted by Ned, but it was going quite well.Â 
Â 
The Baratheons had just taken the throne, I'd say that made them quite powerful, though I guess that's definitely up for debate.
Â 
Â 
I dunno, I just think his character deserved a bit more than this...


Â 
That wasn't success. Mace had a force of the Reach behind him and he couldn't have conquered castle against Stannis and his little force. The siege would have been successful if mace took the castle. He didn't thus siege was epic failure.
Â 
Baratheons took the throne, but they were nowhere near second most powerful House. Their wealth, strength is incomparable to Lannisters, Hightowers, Tyrells... Back then, as it is now.

Â 
You know, if Sansa kills Lysa herself, I would make my peace with it, but it seemed like part of the power of "Only Cat"--and Littlefinger immediately framing someone else--is that it shows just how cold and cruel Littlefinger can be: it wasn't enough to kill Lysa, it was to ensure that her last thought would be the realization that he never loved her.
Â 
Â 
I wonder if Jamie will step in for Tyrion, one handed.
Â 
I'm wondering how the show will handle this.
Â 
I'm also wondering how the show will deal with TV Bronn telling Tyrion he put Shae on a boat. If there's a Tyrion/Bronn scene in 4x07, I imagine the first thing Tyrion would ask Bronn would be "What the fuck, Bronn?"

All good with the no quote(s).Â 
Â 
I wouldn't say Mage's siege was an epic failure; it was strategically wise. Marg says it plenty of times in those cool DVD extras but Mace deciding to just starve the castle out was the best course of action. Here's why:
1.The Reach is plentiful so Mace's army was well supplied and fed. Stannis and co. were eating rats before Davos and the onions.
2. By besieging Storm's End it meant Robert's heir, by all accounts a brilliant battle commander, couldn't enter the fray. Also it distracts Robert's goals knowing that his own castle is being besieged and was done in an attempt to draw him down to break the siege. This fact also sows doubt in houses thatÂ would believe in Robert's cause; what good is a king if he can't even hold his own castle?
3. By not deciding to storm the castle and kill Robert's heir, which, and it's mentioned, would have been easy enough to do, the Tyrell's were pretty close to neutrality and made their pardons that much easier while they didn't really give up any status after the war was over.Â

Â 
Agree with all. The Tyrells made it through Robert's Rebellion with their lands and family members intact (apparently some cousin named Quentyn Tyrell died, but anyone named Quentyn in asoiaf is better off dead), which is more than can be said of other houses (cough * Connington * cough * Martell)

Yeah, I think this week's small council meeting, while CLEARLY mostly about Mace Tyrell being made Master Of Ships  also reintroduced the idea that Jorah was an informant.Â  I like the idea floated earlier in this thread (I think? maybe i read it elsewhere) that Tywin is going to have Varys's birds rat Jorah out to Dany by publishing some old letters 
Â 
A story which the honorable and honest Barristan will then confirm when Dany asks him to confirm/deny this, and then the HSS Friendzone is Sunk.

Probably even money Oberyn comes to Tyrion's cell next episode and they have the "Gregor killed Elia's kids" talk, then Oberyn volunteers before JaimeÂ orÂ Bronn has the chance. This saves us from having to see Bronn turn against Tyrion and Jamie foolishly volunteering. The look Oberyn gave when Tyrion issues the "trial by combat" line and the way he was leaning forward in his chair was shipping it so hard that the scene between him and Tyrion should really be the only KL scene we get next week and IMO should either be the first or second-to-last scene in the Ep IF Lysa flies/Only Cat happens, which it is probably reasonable to assume.

It could mean nothing but that shot did strike me a bit odd. I wonder if they're gonna have Tywin start to show symptoms and Oberyn give his line that "your lord father won't live forever"...

So after Yara's stirring speech last season Â and her 1/2 season long odyssey to the Dreadfort we get her chased away from Theon/Reek by 3 dudes and some dogs? What the hell? How do Benioff and Weiss keep botching this shit up. There a dozen more effective ways this could have played out, even low cost ones, that wouldn't have included a clunky sword fight in tight quarters and Yara scurrying back to her boats after the first sign of any conflict.
Â 
And while the Iron Bank sequence was more impressive, I couldn't help but think how unnecessary it was if they simply altered the story line a little and moved the Battle of Wall into a earlier episode and saved a sequence like that for next year.

And Tyrells were not close to neutrality. They fought Robert several times, and lost... They weren't playing neutral at the beginning...


Mace gave Robert hisÂ only defeat of the war, then decided to play it smart with the SE siege. Like I said, they were in no rush to take the castle by force and wanted to see how the war in the Riverlands would play out. So no, it's not complete neutrality but the lack of action to wait, be patient and take calculated risks and maneuvers was pretty close. The siege was effective; most of the time when you have a far superior army, are well supplied and have no immediate need to take the castle you starve the garrison out. Mace scored a flawless victory with his approach there.Â 
Â 
Tywin did almost the exact same thing without having to leave Casterly Rock. Plus I'm pretty convinced that even if the Mad King had ordered Mace to storm the castle he still would have waited, becauseÂ 
Â 
1. Mace is the one with the huge army of bannermen loyal to him, not the king, and, as mentioned, is incredibly well provisioned and supplied. Thus he can afford to be patient and if the war turns against the rebellion he can then storm the castle.
AND
2. The Lord Oaf of Highgarden simply gives zero fucks.

1021	Bluecore	2014-05-12	There's a difference between women being treated like objects in Westeros and the show itself treating women like sex objects, as well as using rape as flippantly as many people feel they have been -- the latter point is up for debate, the former really isn't.Â  The show is full of female flesh that serves no purpose whatsoever other than objectifying the women for the presumed viewing pleasure of the audience.


Â 
You just described every HBO show since the Sopranos. Sex sells. It always has and it always will; until human beings stop having it. There is nothing particularly objectifying about it.Â 
Â 
When I read these books, they were the most violent thing I had ever read or seen on TV or at the movies. Well guess what? This is the most violent and sexually charged show I've seen, so there you go. If you consider a sort of "quota", they are faaaaaarrrr behind making the quota in terms of the sex and violence GRRM wrote in to the book. Khal Drogo banged Dany 4 or 5 more times in the book than he did on screen, and it was described in much more detail. The war in the Riverlands was muuuuuuuuuch more violent than it was made out to be in the show, and in the show it was pretty freakin violent. My point is, for every "shock" scene that they're putting in the show, they're omitting several from the books.Â 
Â 
Given where we see the show has gone in the last two episodes, the Jaime/Cersei "rape" (wasn't a rape) scene could not have gone the way it did in the books. It would have given the impression that everything between them was hunky-dorey and it clearly isn't. Show Jaime is very close to the state of mind where he ignores Cersei's letter.Â 
Â 
They are doing a good job of depicting the moral degradation of the people of Westeros, and quite frankly that's how a large part of the medieval period was once you get past the monasticism of the Catholic Church (which is all you ever really study in school). It was even worse during the Roman Empire. This is how life was for most of history.Â 
Â 
If you don't like violence and sex in a good story, this is not the show, and was not the book, for you.Â

1022	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-12	Aegon's coming!!! I've always maintained he wouldn't be cut. Also, did what Varys said about his 'desire' for neither men nor women indicate that he isn't Aegon's father, as some speculate?I think that reference is important but I haven't yet decided why. I thought he would say something about Rhaegar, though.
1023	Fat Trell	2014-05-12	Mace gave Robert hisÂ only defeat of the war, then decided to play it smart with the SE siege. Like I said, they were in no rush to take the castle by force and wanted to see how the war in the Riverlands would play out. So no, it's not complete neutrality but the lack of action to wait, be patient and take calculated risks and maneuvers was pretty close. The siege was effective; most of the time when you have a far superior army, are well supplied and have no immediate need to take the castle you starve the garrison out. Mace scored a flawless victory with his approach there.Â 
Â 
Tywin did almost the exact same thing without having to leave Casterly Rock. Plus I'm pretty convinced that even if the Mad King had ordered Mace to storm the castle he still would have waited, becauseÂ 
Â 
1. Mace is the one with the huge army of bannermen loyal to him, not the king, and, as mentioned, is incredibly well provisioned and supplied. Thus he can afford to be patient and if the war turns against the rebellion he can then storm the castle.
AND
2. The Lord Oaf of Highgarden simply gives zero fucks.

Â 
Again, I am not denying that what Mace did wasn't smart and that he wasn't playing a game. What I say is that siege aka conquering the castle is a failure. I am not speaking about Mace's loyalties and the moves in the Game, I am speaking about the excruciatingly long wait.
1025	When Harry met Sansa	2014-05-12	Aegon's coming!!! I've always maintained he wouldn't be cut. Also, did what Varys said about his 'desire' for neither men nor women indicate that he isn't Aegon's father, as some speculate?


Â 
I just took that to mean that Varys desires, as he always has, to remain in a place of power. While I liked most of that scene and thought the camera direction was once again great, I thought the dialogue there could have been better.Â Of course Varys has desires; it literally made no sense for him to say he hates that word and then have his actions best speak to the same word lol.Â 
Â 
Also I guess I am late to the party on this one but how the hell could Varys be Aegon's father?? Wasn't he cut at like age 13? Varys simply wants to be on the side that wins and his loyalty never really left the Targs.Â
1026	Newstar	2014-05-12	Another book/show change I caught...Â Apart from the part about colluding with Sansa to kill Joffrey and the details of how he carried out the murder, most of what TV Shae said about Tyrion was...pretty much true? Book Shae told some pretty ridiculous lies--Tyrion arranged for the death of the boy she was to marry, Tyrion forced her to become a whore, Tyrion threatened to give her to the wildlings if she didn't bed him, Tyrion raped her repeatedly, etc. etc.--but TV Shae..well...Â Tyrion hated Joffrey, Cersei and Tywin? True.Shae was Tyrion's whore? True.Shae was with a knight in the Lannister army (the "ginger-haired cunt" Bronn mentioned in 1x09) when Bronn broke the knight's arm and brought her to Lord Tyrion? True, except for the part about the arm, and that could be true, since we never got the details of how Bronn took Shae away from the "ginger-haired cunt" she was with.He told her "I want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world"? True.Shae did everything he wanted, and whatever he told her to do? True.Shae was his property? Pretty much.Shae would wait in his chambers for hours so he could have sex with her when he was bored? True, from what we've seen.Tyrion ordered her to call him "My lion"? This one's false.Shae told him "I am yours and you are mine"? True.Tyrion only wanted Sansa and not Shae after marrying Sansa? Well, from Shae's perspective, Tyrion lost all interest in having sex with her after marrying Sansa, so I can see why she might think that.Sansa wouldn't let Tyrion into her bed? Well, I wouldn't put it that way, but true.
1027	Zarukhar of Asshai	2014-05-12	What did everyone think of the Oberyn/Varys discussion, particularly the fact that Varys was hinting about his desire to sit on the throne?
1028	HouseHarrison	2014-05-12	Mace isn't as big of a joke in the books as they make him in the show. For better or worse, the show tends to take the most notable trait of a character and elevates it to define them. Mace is mocked, so everything with him is a joke. Loras and Oberyn bang dudes, so tons of gay stuff. Varys is a eunuch, so bring up his missing dick all the time. Littlefinger is a sinister mastermind, so every time he speaks he sounds like a Bond villain. And so on.
Â 
But nonetheless even in the books Mace is barely-competent. He's a pampered product of nobility and is not on the level with the other major characters in the Game of Thrones. However he's competent enough to function administratively and his huge wealth/power nonetheless makes him formidable. But the likes of LF, Varys, Tywin, and so on could run circles around him. Fortunately for Mace, he has Olenna.
Â 
And it needs to be said that Randyll is the one who handed Robert that defeat, not Mace.

I think we just have a fundamental difference in our definitions of successful sieges/siege warfare then haha. I am of the opinion that it is not always about storming the castle and that waiting is sometimes the right choice. Mace basically Xanides Gambited the whole situation here. If the royalists win in the Riverlands regardless of if Mace storms the castle or continues to starve it out, Mace wins. If Robert wins and the Targs lose, Mace doesn't shed any blood and Mace wins. I know you will say that that is all moreso in the game itself rather than just the siege but from a siege only standpoint, Mace put himself in a position to win, and he won.Â 
Â 
Just in the numbers game alone, Stannis lost men and he didn't. The siege, despite the castle not yielding, was effective since the goal of every siege isn't always to capture the castle; it's to take the best course of action. Sometimes a siege is done to prevent the troops/important commanders from linking up with the rest of their forces-both were prevalent here.Â Only an assault, which would mean conquering the castle, could haveÂ been unsuccessful, and since Mace didn't assault it's not possible since I think Mace's goal was to never have to assault.
Â 
Ironically Loras never learned that lesson.

the thing she lied about is being unwilling about all of this.
1031	acejack	2014-05-12	At first, I thought Varys said "the Freys fuck the king", then I was like "oh, the phrase".
1032	Florina Laufeyson	2014-05-12	Oh yeah the Hound drop. I wonder if thats actually the BWB with his helm....
1033	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-05-12	Mace isn't as big of a joke in the books as they make him in the show.

Â 
Yeah, I agree, though sometimes it's the opposite. They take away the most colorful or notable trait of a character and make them look bland, like Mance being Generic Wildling Leader, Tormund being Generic Wildling Sergeant, Daario being Generic Handsome Sellsword, and Asha/Yara losing most of her sassy attitude
1034	Raksha 2014	2014-05-12	How the heck did Varys find "residue" of the strangler potion on the stones in Sansa's necklace? Â Did he have a microscope or other sophisticated lab equipment, or does the strangler potion have a particular color?

No clue; I chalked it up to compelling, damning writing for Varys to keep the unsullied in the dark. Loved the "have you forgotten me?" exchange and foreshadowing. As opposed to LF, who even the unsullied should knowÂ clearly wanted Tyrion removed from the game after having him imprisoned twice with his life on the line, this should be a powerful turn for them and given the foreshadowing we're already getting about the later books might give us something cool with Aegon/Dany this season before Tyrion departs.

Â 
Ever heard of an expression "losing a battle, winning the war"? That was what happened here. This started as argument of how Mace's siege was successful. No, it wasn't. But, it didn't need to be successful if he was playing other game. We are arguing basically the same thing, only you look into boarder picture, and I dealt with the siege alone.Â

You notice that Boros Blount has gone missing?
Â 
....yeah.
1038	espresso	2014-05-12	The only thing that annoyed me was the continually close-ups of Margaery.Â  I get that she's an established actress and she has to be given screen time, but it felt odd to me to focus on her so much.Â 
Margaery is the only person in the throne room (apart from Varys probably) who knows for a fact that Tyrion is innocent. She is getting a good dose of how justice works in Kings Landing, which may be significant to her later.
1039	Yanninho	2014-05-12	Speaking of Margaery, was the guy standing next to her and Loras of any importance ?Â 
Â 
It did seem odd to me that he was such in a high position during the trial, and yet completely unknown.
Â 
Could it be a blink from D&D to what Garlan might have looked like if he was actually in the show ?
1040	Emperoreddy	2014-05-12	Oh yeah the Hound drop. I wonder if thats actually the BWB with his helm....


Â 
Didn't they mention 5 soldiers dead in a bar? I was sure they were referring to the fight in episode 1, but then it is possible its BWB (though seems to soon). FYI I think the Hound gets his wound next week.
1041	The Taxman	2014-05-12	Margaery was sweet eye candy during the trial. Probably the most attractive person there, aside from Oberyn.Â
1042	Cold Hands warm heart	2014-05-12	It's almost like horses are being changed mid stream. I know the Asha/Yara was big and unexpected to end last season but to hangs us out for 'What about your brother." " He s dead" was lame. I love a good fight , but that storyline to replace Kingsmoot? Now is she going to run around the north til Stannis shows, maybe Iron Born could head down to the Twins beat up the Freys for what they did to the King in the North.
Give me an hour of Tyrion and Jon and I'll be happy.
1043	clawson24	2014-05-12	How could so many people be confused as to which bones those were? There was a freaking goat head, huge horns, and some fur! I'm assuming by the end of the season, another person will come forth with bones, Dany will assume it is another goat, and it will be revealed to be the man's child.

On the contrary, I think that storyline will lead to the Kingsmoot.
1045	Emperoreddy	2014-05-12	I remember people wondering in the preview thread whether we would see Tywin eat because of the poison theory. So we got a scene of him CLEARLY eating, drinking and swallowing. Maybe we will get proof the Red Viper got his revenge afterall?

I agree with that.
1047	Emperoreddy	2014-05-12	People hate on the Craster's filler (which I disagree with), but if Yara goes back to Pyke for the Moot, now THAT is waste ofÂ  time filler in my mind. Should of just kept her there and started the Greyjoy arc sooner or let her get caught sooner. Having her go all the way there to go all the way back. I just don't get what that accomplishes.
1048	ground_control	2014-05-12	How the heck did Varys find "residue" of the strangler potion on the stones in Sansa's necklace? Â Did he have a microscope or other sophisticated lab equipment, or does the strangler potion have a particular color?


Varys sniffs the necklace. Â "Iocaine powder, I'd stake my life on it."
1049	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-05-12	So did LF throw the necklace back on the boat so that someone would be able to retrieve it and use it as evidence to frame Tyrion and Sansa?
1050	acejack	2014-05-12	I just want to canvass some support here;
Â 
Does anyone else think that Tywin is going to sell Jorah out with the letter he's sending to Meereen?


Â 
100%
Â 
They showed Oberyn's reaction to the fact that he was formerly spying on her, but I'm sure Tywin picked up on that as well.
1051	Knight of Ashes	2014-05-12	Asha sure gave up quickly after blowing all that hot air.

Yarra is the Locke of this ep.
1052	Emperoreddy	2014-05-12	So did LF throw the necklace back on the boat so that someone would be able to retrieve it and use it as evidence to frame Tyrion and Sansa?


Â 
Good question. They also knew Dontos took Sansa and I have to think LF knew they would be spotted so I would lean he did it on purpose. Either way we the viewer are definitely supposed to be very aware he put it back on the boat. I was surprised people forgot, the way it was shot made it pretty obvious.
1053	clawson24	2014-05-12	In my opinion probably the best written and acted episode of the season thus far. Very, very good.
Â 
Positive stand-outs:
Â 
-Davos being awesome, per usual (really hoping we get his "Vengeance" speech to the Manderlys at some point)
Â 
-Oberyn being awesome, per usual (he's been so pitch-perfect in the role that all my initial casting concerns seem like a distant memory)
Â 
-Varys once again given considerable screen-time (have to think his conversation with Oberyn is a big hint towards Aegon/Jon Connington next season)
Â 
-A great trial scene all-around, with Peter Dinklage absolutely nailing it
Â 
-Hizdahr being a potentially more well-rounded character than he is in the book. Could really stand to help make a lot of Dany's decisions even more easy to scrutinize.
Â 
-Alfie as Reek and Iwan as Ramsey, both perfect.
Â 
Questionable moments:
Â 
-Mark Gatiss' acting was terrific as the lead Iron Banker/Tycho, but it didn't feel "Braavosi" to me. No accent, no ethnic distinction from Westeros, no flair. Felt like the scene could've taken place anywhere really.
Â 
-Stannis' negative qualities still being played up while positive attributes almost non-existant. Episode 9 can't come soon enough.
Â 
-The uneventful fight at the Dreadfort.
1054	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-05-12	So did LF throw the necklace back on the boat so that someone would be able to retrieve it and use it as evidence to frame Tyrion and Sansa?


Â 
Apparently.
Â 
Understanding that those passing judgement aren't at all concerned about justice, I'm confused as to what events are supposed to have transpired. Â Wherever Sansa and Dontos met up with LittleFinger, it took them hours to get there - yet apparently they were still close enough that Dontos's body was sure to be discovered.
Â 
Beyond that, what conclusion is one to draw from a dead Dontos with a crossbow bolt sticking out of his face and a poison necklace laying on his torso. Â That Sansa betrayed and killed him, then betrayed Tyrion and incriminated herself by leaving Joffrey's murder weapon on Dontos's corpse?
1055	clawson24	2014-05-12	So are they simply excluding the part about the goat herder"s child and replacing it with goats? Or was that just a prelude to the child later being killed?


Â 
I think it's just a prelude. Lull Dany and viewers into thinking that the next time someone brings bones wrapped in a cloth before her, it's just another sheep -- when in reality, it's a child.
1056	Emperoreddy	2014-05-12	Yarra is the Locke of this ep.


Â 
Worse as at least you can argue Locke was a red herring, and at minimum it serves as a good moment to show off what Bran can do inside Hodor, and that what he did was REALLY not ok. It had a point from a character perspective along with the red herring.
Â 
THIS seemingly has no value. Only thing you could say is it shows how broken Theon is, but I felt we already knew this and there are other ways to drive that point home again if they felt it needed to.
Â 
Its not even because she failed that the scene bothers me. Her not taking Theon is fine, its her seemingly only being in the dreadfort for 5 minutes, failing and then seemingly just giving up and going home that makes it seem pointless. If she got captured it wouldn't of been as bad, if she took Theon for a spell (and Ramsey hunts them down) it would of be a big deviation, but could of served lots of character moments and been entertaining. Hell if she just stays in the north because she plans to try again it is more satisfying.
Â 
If all that happens was her going all the way to the Dreadfort, spend five minutes, get bit by Theon, then just give up and go back to Pyke to get back on track for the moot. THAT to me is a waste of time. Either should of kept her in Pyke and had her in the moot, or you remove her from the moot and keep her in the north. She can't go back.
1057	Emperoreddy	2014-05-12	Â 
I think it's just a prelude. Lull Dany and viewers into thinking that the next time someone brings bones wrapped in a cloth before her, it's just another sheep -- when in reality, it's a child.


My thoughts as well, felt like a trick to book readers who were expecting it and regular viewers.
Â 
It seems they are starting this arc with Dany that being a queen is a LOT harder then she thought it would be. And starting with just the goat plays into this. She seems pleased as punch with herself and comes off thinking this will be cake. Then Hiz comes in and drops her down a peg, and her frustration knowing she has another 200 people to go starts the road that this will not be easy at all and she is going to have to make compromises she does not like. It all gets worse when Drogon finally kills the kid and she is forced to chain the dragons up.
1058	Widows_Blood	2014-05-12	I remember people wondering in the preview thread whether we would see Tywin eat because of the poison theory. So we got a scene of him CLEARLY eating, drinking and swallowing. Maybe we will get proof the Red Viper got his revenge afterall?


Also, noticed the bells going off when Tywin started drinking the wine. Varys in season 2 stating bells signal the death of a king. Granted, Tywin isn't the king in name, but he is the real power behind the throne.Â
1059	Widows_Blood	2014-05-12	Outside the Reek stuff, the Dreadfort sidestory was just poorly done, but i'm relieved at the very least that Yara didn't end up captured and that theories of her being fArya or married to Ramsay for control of the Iron Islands can be put to a rest. Hopefully she goes to Deepwood Motte or back home to Pyke. I also disagree with the criticism that she just left Theon there after building up the rescue plot. She had no idea Theon was that far broken. To her, Theon, or at least the Theon she knew, is dead. So I don't mind her leaving him. What stupid is the notion they could get into the Dreadfort so easily and then simply waltz back out and that Ramsay would let that happen.Â
1060	ambi76	2014-05-12	I hope they make Salladhor stay loyal in the show  I mean the reason he leaves Stannis is money right?
Â 
From a thousand pages ago, but I still like the idea of Salladhor being used as "Aurane Waters" stand-in. So a Stannis betrayal of him could work in that way. Runs over to Cersei. Promptly betrays her too.Â

Beyond that, what conclusion is one to draw from a dead Dontos with a crossbow bolt sticking out of his face and a poison necklace laying on his torso. Â That Sansa betrayed and killed him, then betrayed Tyrion and incriminated herself by leaving Joffrey's murder weapon on Dontos's corpse?


I had the impression that it was LF's plan to cement the argument against Sansa, effectively making her his hostage. If there was any doubt she was involved in Joffrey's death, she could escape the Vale. If she leaves the Vale now, she faces certain death as a traitor. Her hands are tied, she isÂ  imprisoned.
Â 
I liked the episode a lot with the exception of Yara's scene. I am one of those that enjoyed Craster' keep as it provided 2 interesting developments: Bran making Hodor kill, and Jon shining as a leader which will help his transition to Lord Commander.
Â 
Yara/Asha scene basically told us that Theon is totally Reeked. Perhaps it will make sense that she decides to go for the throne herself in the Kingsmoot, seeing as how her brother is lost.
Â 
I do like this season's long sequences of one storyline/location.
Â 
Edit: The way Oberyn is killing it acting-wise I think at the end of ep.8 the devastation of the Unsullied might even equal RW or Ned's death.

Aegon.


yeah i thought of that too.Â
1064	SlowLoras	2014-05-12	Â 
You just described every HBO show since the Sopranos. Sex sells. It always has and it always will; until human beings stop having it. There is nothing particularly objectifying about it.Â 
Â 


Â 
This would hold more weight if the men in the show were as objectified and sexualised as the women - after all, women watch TV, women watch Game of Thrones, I'd be surprised if the audience ratio wasn't around 50/50 male-female. So why are women naked for no good reason, frequently depicted as having sex or being raped in the background of unrelated scenes - when the male characters, when they are focused on in a sex scene, are usually clothed or covered in some way? I can count the instances of full-frontal male nudity on the fingers of one hand. The same cannot be said of the female nudity.
Â 
I'm no prude. I have no issue with sex, nudity or sex scenes. My problem is how disproportionate it all is. I'm equally interested in hot naked ladies and hot naked men, but on GoT I notice the former is greatly favoured over the latter. So the problem here isn't that sex sells - tell us something we don't know - but that, for GoT, naked women sell. Sexualised women sell. Sex sells, but mostly when we're catering to what men want.
Â 
I can take or leave the nudity, but if they're going to have so much of it, at least make it equal.
1065	hvfp	2014-05-12	Guess we're gonna see Moat Cailin early.


Since the facts in book 5 are supposed to happen at the same time as the ones in book 4, it doesn`t seem too much of a rush. Except that Moat Cailin is supposed to be undermanned because Victarion left for the kingsmoot. Sending Theon to deal with Victarion seems like a stretch, wonder how they`ll pull it off.
1066	Frey Pies	2014-05-12	By the way, what are everyone's favourite episodes after this week's cracker?
Â 
Mine are:
1. The Rains of Castamere
2. Blackwater
3. The Laws of Gods and Men
4. Kissed by Fire
5. Baelor

Â 
Â 
Very good points. Â I think the only male actor we've seen in full frontal nudity is Alfie Allen as Theon, though I could be wrong and there could be some minor role male characters baring it all; though I can't remember any. Â 
Â 
I would imagine that the main character males might have clauses/stipulations in their contracts about no frontal nudity (as would the leading females). Â Haven't noticed any shots of even semi-naked Cersei or Ned or Littlefinger. Â I'm trying to remember, but I don't recall seeing any naked Drogo shots; though there were plenty of views of naked Daenerys.

I think the guy who plays male Ros had let all his guard down in Breaker of Chains. And of course Hodor.

1069	petertel123	2014-05-12	I actually liked Emilia's acting this week
loved tyrions rage, especially calling Shae a "lying whore"
braavos and the iron bank were cool
Yara/theon was pretty anticlimactic but expected
best episode in the season so far
1070	Maria26	2014-05-12	Someone should open a next thread with next week episode's preview in the "Mockingbird" section, so people can actually talk about the episode there. 
Â 
Anyway I thought that this was a great episode.
Â 
People keep complaining about Dany or Emilia's Clark acting skills but to this day she is probably better than most of the actors on this show. She just sells it very easily to me. Love this new side of Dany story where they actually show us that she ain't perfect, she has flaws, she may have the best intentions but makes mistakes along the road. You know...something realistic for a change. Love Hizdar, I find Joel Fry so cute and bringing a all new "light" for the character. Not at all how I ilagined him to be from the books.
Â 
The trial was the best part of the episode.
Â 
Love the Council and Varys talking about Jorah and what's going on with Dany. The look on Oberyn's face made me only think of one thing "QUENTYN". I hope that Varys talking about Jorah and how he isn't spying for the Council anymore is us moving forwards and having the pleasure to see him being exiled by the end of the season. I feel bad for the actors playing Jorah and Barristan though...they're jus there...doing nothing...
Â 
Didn't give a damn about Stanis. Thought it was boring!
Â 
Drogon eating the goat and not the child...WTF?
Â 
Now from the previews for next week episode we have Daario back (I'm not sure what he wants by saying to Dany to let him fight... are they gonna fuck or what?), crazy Lysa, more trial and THE MOUNTAIN!!!

1071	Natasi	2014-05-12	In the books, the reader and Dany never know for certain if Drogon ate Hazzea. Maybe they will show it later to remove the mystery, but everyone in this thread is stating it as a fact. It's very likely that it happened, and Dany reacts to it in the book as if it did, but again...  we still don't know for certain.
1072	MoIaF	2014-05-12	In the books, the reader and Dany never know for certain if Drogon ate Hazzea.

Â 
I just noted that the goat herder came in right before Hizface, so Hizzy knows what happened. I liked the ambiguity in the books even though there was a good chance Drogon ate the kid.Â
1073	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-12	Well for one they are making it ridicules clear Varys is team Lannister.Â 

Like they did at that point in the books, then? Nah, Aegon is gonna show.
1074	igrewupinKL	2014-05-12	Enjoyed seeing Braavos, the Iron Bank and scene with Salladhor Saan.Â 
Â 
Honestly, Yara's speech was awesome, but when she got to Theon...it was hard to watch. I think it's just the fact that I feel Theon would not be that broken this early. But arghhh her little rescue, would've been better without it i think. So now Theon's little moat cailin adventure is too early. I'm sure the show people will do well to make it work
Â 
Best part of Dany's scene was Drogon and the sheep herder. Definitely a bit empty, and was kind've confused as to why Hizdahr was speaking in an english accent.
Â 
KL's time was the best. I don't know how i feel about the council knowing so much about Dany...? did this happen in the books? I think they are building Jorah up as a traitor. I thought Varys's scene was SO out of character, but i guess they need to build him up as something, but his conversation with Oberyn really irked me for some reason.
Tyrion, Jaime, Cersei, Tywin and Shae receive an A+
They made Shae to look like she was frightened, and made to say those things. But my unsullied family didn't pick up on it--or didn't say anything
Best lines go to Oberyn
1075	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-05-12	I loved how when everybody else stood up when Tywin entered the Small Council meeting, Oberyn was in full on No Shits Given Mode and didn't even try to get up.
1076	ipsuel	2014-05-12	The thing about Shae that seems lost on a lot of viewers is that she not only has to do it for Cersei -- she's also a pissed off, scorned woman... hence the reason they added in that line, "I'm just a whore, remember?" (Referring to what he says when he makes her leave a few eps ago).Â 
Â 
It's her saying to Tyrion, "Fk You! You sent me away after calling me a whore! You hurt me first!"
Â 
So yes, she's scared and yes, Cersei got to her -- but she's also thinking revenge as a woman scorned.Â
1077	Maria26	2014-05-12	Am I the only one who got a Euron vibe while watching Daario in the preview for next week episode? I'm still confused as to why he's saying "let me kill you ennemies, any ennemies...anywhere". Don't remember what part of the story is that particular moment supposed to be.

1079	Hot Kidney Pie	2014-05-12	Did I just read someone say that Varys is CLEARY on 'Team Lannister'..
PLEASE
Tell that to Uncle Kev
1080	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-12	Did I just read someone say that Varys is CLEARY on 'Team Lannister'..
PLEASE
Tell that to Uncle Kev
 
I don't even understand how anyone could come to that conclusion!
1081	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-05-12	Did they cut Kevan? Cause if Tywin where to die without a heir, power of Casterly Rock goes to Kevan and not lancel(as jaime said) right?
1082	Night's_King	2014-05-12	Wow. After the first four episodes of this season I was on the brink of giving up and stop watching, because the episodes were soooo bad. But then there came First of his Name and The Laws of Gods and Men. Those two have already made it in the list of my top episodes!
Â 
The only thing in this episode I cannot really understand is why they had to make that Asha filler. I really cannot see the purpose of that.
1083	Chebyshov	2014-05-12	Did they cut Kevan? Cause if Tywin where to die without a heir, power of Casterly Rock goes to Kevan and not lancel(as jaime said) right?


Â 
Kevan was in S1, so I doubt it. I think they just name-dropped Lancel so that Tyrion can tell Jaime Cersei and Lancel slept together.
Â 
What is going to happen with the "little birds" getting into Mereen? Does that mean the poisoning probably wasn't Hizdahr? Also not sure why people are worried about the goat thing...that dragon is obviously going to snatch up a child at some point. They just wanted to set the repayment for goats as a standards.
1084	Nettles	2014-05-12	I loved the episode. Hizdar has established himself as a dangerous foe, even formidable, I'd say. Just remembering his body language when watching Daenerys from the walls with a calculating look on his face makes me shudder.Â 
Now I wonder how they are going to play the marriage thing with Danny presumably having her father-in-law crucified?
Â 
During the whole process I found Margery's facial expressions excellent. She was aware of the whole farce and was the only one who knew the truth. It must be terrifying to realise you are surrounded by such filth.Â 
Â 
Tywin's letter will cause the rift between Danny and Jorah and she'll banish him. Standard move on Tywin's part, breaking alliances. Danny hasn't read her Sun Tzu The Art of War, so she will fall into his trap.
1085	hvfp	2014-05-12	KL's time was the best. I don't know how i feel about the council knowing so much about Dany...? did this happen in the books? I think they are building Jorah up as a traitor.


Â 
Â 


Daario is gonna discover that Jorah was/is a spy


Â 
I guess Tywin is going to rat Jorah or something like that with that quill and paper he asked.
In the books it`s Arstan Whitebeard who points Mormont is a Vary`s informer, just after he reveals himself to be Barristan Selmy.Â He says he had to hide his true identity from them because Jorah was working for KL, and comes out only after Jorah recognizes him.
Since in the series Selmy have already revealed his identity and the small council already know about his association with Dany, that leaves some questions:
- Selmy was in the small council before Joffrey`s coronation. How didn`t he know Mormont worked for Varys? If he knew, why didn`t he tell Dany?
1086	Colonel Green	2014-05-12	- Selmy was in the small council before Joffrey`s coronation. How didn`t he know Mormont worked for Varys?
No, he wasn't.  The show changed that.
1087	Maria26	2014-05-12	So we're saying that Jorah's banishment will take place during 4X10? It's gonna be heartbreaking for both Jorah and Daenerys.
Â 
I still hope we're gonna more of the "Relationship" between Dany and Daario. Still want to see them fuck at some point LOL But first a little more build-up would be nice.
Â 
We're getting "Only Cat" next episode...time goes by quickly in this show.
1088	Nettles	2014-05-12	Wow. After the first four episodes of this season I was on the brink of giving up and stop watching, because the episodes were soooo bad. But then there came First of his Name and The Laws of Gods and Men. Those two have already made it in the list of my top episodes!
Â 
The only thing in this episode I cannot really understand is why they had to make that Asha filler. I really cannot see the purpose of that.


Â 
I saw it as an update on Theon and the enormity and extent of damage done by Ramsay. I think it explains his future participation in capturing Moat Cailin.Â
1089	hvfp	2014-05-12	No, he wasn't. The show changed that.


Thanks, I didn`t notice that.
1090	Night's_King	2014-05-12	Â 
I saw it as an update on Theon and the enormity and extent of damage done by Ramsay. I think it explains his future participation in capturing Moat Cailin.Â 


Â 
But it does not make any sense for me. The Dreadford is on the other side of Westeros. So Asha just sailed around Dorne to save Theon and gives up shortly after seeing him?
1091	Joey Monger	2014-05-12	Tell 'im, Davos!!! ayyyeeeee this is the justice king stannis gave me
1092	Cersei the Great	2014-05-12	Â 
And the Emmy goes to...................Lock!Â 


Â 
Â 
That was my thought too. Â Great acting!
1093	Waylin Stark	2014-05-12	What was with the blood on Ramsay's chest? Did he kill a bunch of Ironborn or did he slaughter his whore?
And that guy definitely has the balls Theon lacks. Went against the Ironborn bare chested.
1094	Chebyshov	2014-05-12	Tywin's letter will cause the rift between Danny and Jorah and she'll banish him. Standard move on Tywin's part, breaking alliances. Danny hasn't read her Sun Tzu The Art of War, so she will fall into his trap.


Â 
I'm betting you're right about this
1095	Waylin Stark	2014-05-12	Looks like Only Cat is next episode. What a bummer. I wanted episode 10 to have all the best moments like Tyrion's escape, Tywin's death, Lord Commander Jon Snow, Only Cat, and Stoneheart.
Â 
Only Cat would have been the best scene to end Sansa's arc this season. But seeing as we have 3 more episodes after that, I suppose we'll see more LF scheming and plotting following the aftermath of Lysa's fall.
Â 
Also I wonder how they'll introduce Oberyn as champion. Will they take Tyrion back to the stand? In ASoS, it happened immediately after Shae's confession, right? With Oberyn having met Tyrion before? Or am I wrong?
1096	Cersei the Great	2014-05-12	We can only hope. Â It is my perfect final image of the season.Â 


I was hoping she would appear in the final scene of Ep 10 as well. Â Perfect ending. Â Unsullied would be like 'What??????!!!"
1097	Bastard of Boston	2014-05-12	I usually try not to be "that guy," as I enjoy the show enough to not go all "book Nazi" on people. But, aside from how unnecessary I found the Yara scenes, I was somewhat bothered by the ease and swiftness of her breaking into the Dreadfort. And, how Ramsay decided to take on a group of armored men with himself shirtless and shield-less. Since when did he become Conan? I had to chuckle.
Â 
I enjoyed the intro of Hisdahr. I'm not all that compelled by him in the novels, so here's hoping the show can craft a better version for me.
Â 
As excited as I am to see Mycroft on GoT, count me among the group wishing that Braavos would be more culturally different than Westeros.
1098	Natalie Underfoot	2014-05-12	Really enjoyed this episode. Â Nothing to say about the trial scene that hasn't been said other than the dynamics were great. Â The scheming and plotting between Tywin and Jamie and Jamie and Tyrion and meanwhile Cersei just sitting there until the trial of combat moment and just slight facial expression of satisfaction.
Â 
Glad to see Dany being unsure. Emilia is a good actress but they've been riding the Dany Triumphant train for a whole season now and I"m glad to see it come to a halt. Â Last episode we had her acknowleding she should have listend to Jorah's council and now, with her look at Barristan after her realization about crucifying the masters and how she should have listened to him. Will make the betrayal even more difficult as I think we're going to start seeing her lean on them more. I also like the my fleshed out Hizdar, his character always felt rushed in the book.Â 
Â 
Oberyn my heart is already breaking for you.
Â 
Tremendous acting by Alfie in the Reek scene. Â It was filler but I didn't mind it because I find all of these characters more captivating than random Nights Watch assholes. Â Also, expecting Moat Cailin to be Episode 8 or 10 with the news of Balon's death coming and maybe that's why Victarion leaves? Â I"m thinking we will have way more Greyjoy next season along with Dorne.
Â 
I also liked the DAvos, STannis scene. Â I remember in the book feeling like part of the issue with Stannis was that he was broken on the Blackwater and Davos had to keep trying to rile him, while Mel kept trying to use her magic to seduce him. Â We saw him kinda being carried on by Mel's plan but not being happy about it and now we get a rousing speech of loyalty from Davos just in time for Episode 9: How Stannis Got His Groove Back
1099	ridilon	2014-05-12	For a moment there I thought we were going to get a full frontal of Reek in all his sans genitals glory. Â 
Â 
Â
1100	Cersei the Great	2014-05-12	For a moment there I thought we were going to get a full frontal of Reek in all his sans genitals glory. Â

I was wondering that as well. Â
1101	RavenKing23	2014-05-12	Favourite comment about the episode so far, from the AV Club commenters' thread:
Â 
(About Tyrion's speech): "That was some real wrestling villain talk, right down to the crowd booing."
Â 
Laughing forever. It's funny because it's true.
It's also Tyrion's heel turn so it fits very well
1102	Greywolf2375	2014-05-12	??? Dany didn't notice that was a child?


Â Been answered, but no...was the goat and we will probably see another get presented before we get a child.Â  would like more build up, but there's only so much time.
Â 


Even Shae can't speak ill of the saintly man


Â She doesn't need to - all she needs to do is reinforce what everyone is already thinking about him.Â  Regicide & kinslaying are obviously worse, but all she needed to do was show in another light how Tyrion was always about Tyrion and his needs.
Â 


Tyrion man I know you're upset but most of these spectators don't even have names. They ain't do shit to you man


Â that's the point...he didn't know any of them, yet his actions saved them.Â  None of them know him, yet they are all comdemning him...
Â 


Â 
3) It makes no sense for Oberyn to volunteer to be champion at this point. He wants to kill the Mountain, but he hasn't been declared as Cersei's champion yet.


Â Sure it does, it is a perfect opportunity for Oberyn to give Tywin a big FUCK YOU.Â  When he finds out that the champion is Gregor, it makes it even better.
Â 


It is so improper for Tywin to ask Lord Mace Tyrell to fetch pen and paper for him, Mace is not his servant.


Â Everyone is Tywins servant.
Â 
Â 


Â 
No, Tywin is not that powerful, it is like President Obama tells Mr Biden" Hi, Briden, be a good man, go and make me a cup of coffe, will you?"


Â Bad analogy.Â  Everyone is subservient to Tywin and always have been...
Â 


Â 
Oh for the love of...GO AWAY! Im notÂ uncomfortable. Im tired of theÂ whinging! If you dont like what you are seeing, stop feeding the pig by watching it! Armchair Activists. fucking lol


Â So instead of making more comments on it, put the person on ignore so you don't have to see them. That poster has every right to complain about the nudity as Stannis fans have to complain about his characterization.
1103	Fool of a Book	2014-05-12	A few observations -Â 
Â 
- It seemed to me that Shae's confused expression when Tyrion asked for a trial by combat meant she was in on the ruse: Â that Tywin did plan on sending Tyrion to the Wall. Â It seemed the biggest part of Tywin's plan. Â He didn't call Shae as witness until after his conversation with Jaime, he likely knew she would provide the most damaging (false) evidence and that Tyrion could finally confess and plead for mercy. Â Anyway, sets up a Tywin/Shae relationship for... later. Â And provides a motive for Shae's lies, which is not so clear in the book.
Â 
BTW it's the only time I've even remotely liked tv!Shae actress, whatever her name is.
Â 
- the appearance of the necklace was eye-rolling. Â I guess they needed to hammer the unsullied over the head
Â 
- Â Varys' testimony seemed to me something he was personally asked to relay, since Tywin, Cersei and Pycelle were also there and surely remembered Tyrion saying that. Â They just needed another witness to spread out the evidence. Â I didn't see this as a betrayal of Tyrion personally.
Â 
- When Pycelle gives his list of poisons, it's Oberyn that immediately knows what they all are, and speaks first to him.
Â 
- Tywin gulping dark red wine while the bells ring was a great touch. Â Adds fuel to the fire about Oberyn poisoning him, especially because we were shown Oberyn knows about poisons AND has "much better wine" than otherwise available in KL. Â Seriously, that wine was a very dark color, not the usual medium red usually shown.
Â 
- Oberyn and Varys. Â While odd that Oberyn seemed to be interested in a whorehouseparty with Varys, yeah this scene was obviously a set-up for Aegon. Â  When they're talking about Oberyn travelling in Essos for five years (wonder what that means?) and Varys says something like "We aren't all born princes..." Â 
Â 
Which could be taken a few ways. Â In context with the Oberyn convo, he is saying he himself isn't a Prince (killing Blackfyre theories). Â But we know that he really means he either has a trueborn Prince, or that someone doesn't need to be born a Prince to take the throne. Â Then staring at the throne thinking "Soon......" Â  Nice set-up for future events and speculation.
Â 
- I personally liked the Dreadfort scene, but the cut between "How fast can you run?" and the Ironborn running to the rowboat was more comical than suspenseful. Â 
Â 
- Re: the 7 or 8 Â minutes that seemed to have been cut. Â Shirtless Ramsay was covered in blood splatters. Â I think we won't be seeing his crazy lover alive again anytime soon. Â The guy was filled with crazy manic bloodlust, not quite the way most men are after an intense lovemaking session. Â
1104	StrollofShame	2014-05-12	yeah i thought of that too.Â 

Seems totally obvious, if only to bookreaders.
1105	jons nissa	2014-05-12	Did I just read someone say that Varys is CLEARY on 'Team Lannister'..
PLEASE
Tell that to Uncle Kev


Â 
actually varys is definitely team lannister. killing kevan was to keep tommen and cersei on the throne so they would continue to create a mess in king's landing. he'll be team lannister until he's ready to reveal aegon when we will see where his true allegiance lies. but until then: go lions, go!
1106	sj4iy	2014-05-12	I bet Balon Greyjoy is drinking in Pyke to all the guys and gals killed in the show while they're still alive in the books, Just chillin' in the castle waiting for the storm to kill him.
Â 
And since Mockingbird is the Ep 7, I already figured out this was gonna be the 'Only Cat' episode.
Â 
Man, look likes <z have :
Â 
E07 : Only Cat
E08 : Oberyn vs Gregor
E09 : The Battle at the Wall
E10 : Tywin dyin' + UnCat
Â 
We can say for sure this end of season is gonna kill the Internet.

I've never been so excited.

interesting observation. this makes me think they will keep shae as the whore with the heart of gold and push that she was forced to testify but didn't agree until tywin explained the plan is for tyrion heading to the wall.
1108	W1NT3RF3LL	2014-05-12	My initial thoughts:Â 
Â 
I loved Braavos in the opening, it was very cute. The Braavos scene itself though, kind of weird. But still good. And very shiny. And I'm happy they showed Salla again. I don't know why, I just can't get enough of that guyÂ  
Â 
YarAsha storming the Dreadfort seemed like the most pointless thing in the history of everything. Maybe it's just me but that whole scene was completely useless aside from letting us remember that YarAsha exists (and is suddenly very dumb). Run into the fort, battle a little, run away. Done.
Â 
I like Tyrion's trial. That Shae stuff was great.
Â 
And Oberyn was on fire this episode. Cute, sexy, everythingÂ   I only wish the episode ended with him announcing he'd champion for Tyrion.I have noticed a few people say the same thing that oberyn should have declared champion for tyrion. To me that would have been too quick as I believe oberyn is a on few more council meetings and he meets tyrion in his cell to speak with him.  I think they did it just right.
1109	StrollofShame	2014-05-12	Â 
I just took that to mean that Varys desires, as he always has, to remain in a place of power. While I liked most of that scene and thought the camera direction was once again great, I thought the dialogue there could have been better.Â Of course Varys has desires; it literally made no sense for him to say he hates that word and then have his actions best speak to the same word lol.Â 
Â 
Also I guess I am late to the party on this one but how the hell could Varys be Aegon's father?? Wasn't he cut at like age 13? Varys simply wants to be on the side that wins and his loyalty never really left the Targs.Â 

I'm being partially facetious...everyone who's anyone has been theorized as a secret Targ, & it has been tossed about that either Varys or Illyrio is Aegon's real father, by way of a Targ momma, who was married to/sister of one or the other. I do believe Varys was snipped when quite young. But he kind of allows to Oberyn that his entire focus has been on having the IT seated HIS way.

Dude, it was a suicide mission from the get-go. The place is called the Dreadfort. What did she expect she was going to find there, rainbows and unicorns?


no, those are in Skagos.Â  
Â 


Stunned by the number of people who think there was any serious amount of sincerity in anything that Hizdahr said. I doubt if his father spoke out against the stuff he said at all. He's just coming in with a sob story because he's probably heard that the new queen always buys sob stories. We saw that with the goatherd.


Â 
I thought he might be sincere--only because they've made several characters more sympathetic than in the books.Â  Also was thinking they might create a triangle with Dany-Daario-Hizdahr...
Â 


I wonder if Jamie will step in for Tyrion, one handed.


Â 
I hope not.Â  Jaime is smart enough to know that if he tries to defend Tyrion, they will both die.Â  Also, it violates his duty as KG.
Â 


Margaery is the only person in the throne room (apart from Varys probably) who knows for a fact that Tyrion is innocent. She is getting a good dose of how justice works in Kings Landing, which may be significant to her later.


Â 
Thanks.Â  I completely missed that part! 
Â 

As excited as I am to see Mycroft on GoT, count me among the group wishing that Braavos would be more culturally different than Westeros.

Also, isn't Syrio from Braavos?Â  If so, they've already established an ethnic look and accent...
1112	DebL66	2014-05-12	Pedro Pascal is fantastic as Oberyn.Â  I wish the writers didn't have to clobber us over the head all the time that Oberyn likes his sexy time.Â  We get it.Â  Still, Pascal is so good in this role that I am really sad that his journey on the show is near an end.Â  Loved it when he remained sitting while everyone else stood when Tywin entered the Small Council.
Â 
Alfie Allen is killing it as Reek.Â  His performance is amazing and makes me forgive the filler Yara scene just because it so clearly illustrated how beaten down he has become.Â  The terror in his eyes when Yara tries to free him was an outstanding performance.
Â 
Loved the trial.Â  Loved Hizdahr (more interesting than book Hizdahr).Â  Love that they are showing Dany's difficulties when it comes to ruling.

It's called cutting your losses.

We've seen one entity in the Iron Bank and all the unsullied know from them is that they deal with Westerosi all the time. Let's not jump the gun here and conclude that all of Braavos will be like Westeros; I am sure once we get Arya next season we'll fully discover how diverse and awesome Braavos and its people are.Â

1129	Salad Days Saan	2014-05-12	Also, given that we had a 20 page thread last week debating/disputing Emilia Clarke's range as an actress I really feel like I have to say she was real solid during the Hizdhar speech.Â  Stiff Upper Lip in words and speech, trying to stay on message, but her eyes told a very different story.Â  Dany was rattled, underneath, and we all saw it.
Â 
She showed Dany's mask slipping and it was really, really good.Â  And we could feel the exasperation and the "aw FUCK, there's 212 more of these?" in her voice even when those exact words were left unsaid.Â  I am quite pleased.

I do hope for the return of Kevan Lannister, and we will have Qyburn. Maybe that will be all, but I hope for a possibly merged Rowan/Redwyne Tyrell bannerman, even though I doubt it.Â Â 
After this episode Kevan is definitely out, IMHO. It has been stressed that there is nobody among the Lannisters to keep the things together should anything happen to Tywin, and Lancel has been namedropped. IMHO, he is the Lannister who is going to show up and take over some of Kevan's role, while the rest will go to Jaime and Pycelle. Jaime is technically a member of the council and is going to actually sit there finally, and they may put Loras there too (briefly). No need to introduce Kevan when they have already established characters with not enough to do.
Â 
Early in ASOS when Tywin shows up to be hand and Sort Out Business (including 'shipping Cersei/Balon LOL) Mace is Robin Quivers to Tywin's Howard Stern, laughing loudest at his jokes and praising his every suggestion as brilliant.
Â 
It's how Lord Oaf rollsAnd also, grabbing honors, lands and titles like nobody's business, as Tyrion noted. Tywin wouldn't have been giving him all these concessions if he didn't feel that he had to. Book Mace was successfully grasping, and we don't know how sincere the QoT's disparagement of him was. She was trying to win Sansa's trust, after all. He didn't cover himself with glory during the Rebellion, but IIRC Connington did have Reach lords and men in his army and nobody asked for Tyrell troops before the Trident. I'd also guess that they were investing not just Storm's End, but much of the Stormlands, so that Robert couldn't get any more troops from there.
In the show, it wouldn't make sense for the QoT to abandon her descendants in KL if Mace is a complete oaf and Marge's position hasn't even been made official. In the books, she only left after her marriage to Tommen happened.
Re: Dany and the goatherd, it has been established in the books that Dany compensates people for livestock allegedly eaten by dragons. Here they showed her gaffe of offering thrice the price of the animals (quite subtle, with Barristan's understated reaction), which will lead to her being inundated with fraudulent claims.
Re: Hazzea, in the books it isn't even known if she was murdered by Drogon. He was seen in the area, but Nobody witnessed her death and it happened when Sons of the Harpy were alteady active and had a reason to blacken Dany's image among the farmers. I imagine that they will leave it nice and ambiguous in the show, too.
From TPaTQ we know that wild dragons didn't attack humans unless provoked or aroused by bloodshed.

1136	Feather Crystal	2014-05-12	The weirdest bit was Sansa's necklace. We saw Littlefinger crush Sansa's necklace, so how the hell did Pycell get it or one that looked exactly like it? In that Rolling Stone interview with GRRM there was this:
Â 
That killing happens early in this fourth season. The books, of course, are well past the poisoning of King Joffrey.Â In the books â<U+0080><U+0093> andÂ I make no promises, because I have two more books to write, and I may have more surprises to reveal â<U+0080><U+0093> the conclusion that the careful reader draws is that Joffrey was killed by the Queen of Thorns, using poison from Sansa's hairnet, so that if anyone did think it was poison, then Sansa would be blamed for it. Sansa had certainly good reason for it.
Â 
Doesn't it sound like GRRM is hinting there's more to Joffrey's poisoning than we suspect? Last week when Cersei asked Margaery if she still wanted to be Queen I thought, what the fuck? Wouldn't it be a real pisser if Cersei was in on the poisoning? It's a crazy idea I know, but Tyrion says, "if there's one person I'm sure of that didn't kill Joffrey it's Cersei." That's just too good of a line to not be true. Oh the irony! Think about it. Cersei was losing control of Joffrey, and there's also this from the Rolling Stones interview:
Â 
I don't know if somebody like Jaime or Cersei can be redeemed. Cersei's a great character â<U+0080><U+0093> she's like Lady Macbeth.Â Well, redeemed in whose eyes? She'll never be redeemed in the eyes of some. She's a character who's very protective of her children. You can argue, well,Â does she genuinely love her children,Â or does she just love them because they're herÂ children? There's certainly a great level of narcissism in Cersei.
Â 
I would argue that Cersei viewed Joffrey as "hers", and when he wasn't "hers" anymore, she wanted him dead.

i will admit right away that davos/sallador and reek/ramsay scenes could have been skipped, but i think the Trial just made up for all of it! Peter dinklage has to get a nomination at least for his performance...and just all of it, jaime/tywin even!Â

I thought the whole point of the Yara/Theon scene was to show how far gone Theon was as Reek, being he was too afraid to leave with her.
1140	Janicia	2014-05-12	In the books, Dany started paying for livestock eaten by the dragons and then a bunch of people start claiming that the dragons ate their livestock. Â It seemed likely that some of those people were lying, but Dany didn't know who so she kept paying out. Â Given that backdrop, it wasn't clear if Drogon had really killed a child or if the farmer was lying to get the payout. Â I assumed the show wouldn't have time to set up that uncertainty, but it is neat that they made time for it. Â 
Â 
So I guess all that blood on Ramsay was from happy sex scratches? Â Ramsay happily joining a melee covered in blood and unprotected was kinda awesome. Â He's emphatically a different kind of crazed evil than Joffrey. Â Â 
Â 
I would have preferred if Davos had caught up with Sallador in a bar rather than a hot tub with naked women, but oh well. Â The scene did draw my attention to the similarities between Davos' relationships with Sallador and with Stannis. Â Davos likes both men, doesn't like some of their choices but he's pretty easygoing and nonjudgemental about it. Â

I'm assuming the scene from this episode is set-up to having a bunch of people demanding payment, and it's going to culminate with a dead child. Dany needs a reason to lock up the dragons.

No need to introduce Kevan when they have already established characters with not enough to do.
Â 


Â 
Kevan was introduced is S1; he was sitting in Tywin's war council. I don't remember if he was in Tywin's councils in S2. So I guess it would be only reintroducing, then. I'm pretty sure he will get to KL at some point in S5 only to see how Cersei has fucked everything up. Then he'll die as in ADWD's epilogue.

From TPaTQ we know that wild dragons didn't attack humans unless provoked or aroused by bloodshed.

I thought they name dropped Lancel to bring him back in so Tyrion can tell Jaime that Cersei fucked him and Jaime is driven away once and for all when Lancel confirms it?
Btw, Tyrion can still be pissed at Jaime re the true Tysha story, but I can't see Jaime's reason for being angry with Tyrion re Joff playing out the same, can you? Or am I misreading the vibe?

No, Littlefinger crushed one of the stones, and then tossed the necklace into the boat.Â  It was otherwise intact.
1152	Inv1ctus	2014-05-12	Was there a little smile that Tyrion gave to Tywin at the end?  I wonder how many non-readers think that Jaime will fight for Tyrion at trial. Was thinking how interesting it would be for Cersei and Tywin if Jamie would want to fight for Tyrion. Because if I remember correctly in the books Oberyn first offered to be Tyrion's champion and after that Tyrion demanded trial by combat. Now it will obviously be reversed, maybe also because people will now think about Jamie being the champion. Hyphoteticaly speaking, could Jamie fight for Tyrion as a kingsguard or are there some laws prohibiting him from that? Since the kingsguard are the voice of the king.Â
1153	DrownedSnow	2014-05-12	Â 
Kevan was introduced is S1; he was sitting in Tywin's war council. I don't remember if he was in Tywin's councils in S2. So I guess it would be only reintroducing, then. I'm pretty sure he will get to KL at some point in S5 only to see how Cersei has fucked everything up. Then he'll die as in ADWD's epilogue.


Â 
Â 
It's possible they'll bring him in next season and just have kept him out until needed so they can cast the right actor and not have to recast him. Maybe they haven't decided if they will have Kevan come back or not. I thinking reference to his nephews just was talking about the younger generation. Kevan would be old, just like Tywin, so he couldn't be the future of the house.
1154	Chebyshov	2014-05-12	Was there a little smile that Tyrion gave to Tywin at the end?  I wonder how many non-readers think that Jaime will fight for Tyrion at trial.

Â 
The Unsullied seem to assume it will be Bronn again. I think Tyrion would be hesitant to choose a man who's learning to swing a sword. But you're right; the order of Oberyn offering is switched in the show.
1155	rmholt	2014-05-12	Any word on who's going to be playing the Mountain? I just hope it's not the guy from season 2.

Tangent:  we've also seen Ian Whyte as a giant and a White Walker
1156	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-12	Any word on who's going to be playing the Mountain? I just hope it's not the guy from season 2.


Â 
hafthor bjornsson...google him, he's a perfect Gregor
1157	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2014-05-12	They really highlighted Stannis weakness. He is king by right it is his duty. He will beg of no one. Not even the Iron Bank after he was crushed in battle. It's his only play but regardless he won't bow to anyone. Back the one true king or he doesn't need you. Except he needs almost everything  at this point. No money. Small army. Few allegiances.
1158	Natalie Underfoot	2014-05-12	I love those little moments this season when we see someone talking about Dany or dragons and camera gives a close up on Oberyn's face.  It is great watching it as a book reader and will be great for Unsullied to rewatch a few years from now when they will now what Oberyn knew. 


Â 
After that small council I made a comment about "time for another letter" and my husband, who is Unsullied, was confused. Â I explained that Oberyn is keeping his brother informed and that there's some new info that he needs to know. Also, he probably wanted to clear up that he wasn't the one to poison the king.Â 
Â 
There could seriuosly be a whole Tumblr dedicated to Oberyn's letters to Dorne. Â "King poisoned, wasn't me" Â "Targ heir is a girl now, is Quentyn still available" "Dragons be big" "Varys=not into boys"
1159	basilisk312	2014-05-12	~~Â And Oberyn was on fire this episode. Cute, sexy, everythingÂ    I only wish the episode ended with him announcing he'd champion for Tyrion.


Â 
that's coming, i think there's some drama between jaime and tyrion to be milked from that first
1160	raj34	2014-05-12	I'm shocked at how bad that episode was. Really, it must be one of the best examples yet of why they should stick to the damn books instead of fulfilling some fanfic fantasy. They're clearly too incompetent as writers to do the series justice by making stuff up as they go along.


Â 
How do you ignore somone? I clicked on the profile name but there's doesn't seem to be an ignore function..
1161	Strytos	2014-05-12	Nice episode overall, But I'm pretty confused about Shae's motivation to testify. In HBO's behind the scenes video 'No Turning Back'Â Sibel Kekilli states Shae wants revenge, but during the scene itself it seemed to me she was obviously coerced. Either they are stillÂ going somewhere different with Shae or their decision to change her character so much has finally come back to bite them.Â
1162	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2014-05-12	I took it as Shae is totally Cersei's pawn but she is going to take her jabs at Tyrion out of spite

Â 


Â 
I don't get this whole 'dark side' of Tyrion stuff. He was just pissed off. It was the same character.
1165	Palin	2014-05-12	Does Varys know Arya is alive but he chooses not to reveal it? He had his "birds" find information on the Hound in the riverlands, insofar that they even knew word for word what the Hound said as he killed those soldiers. I find it hard to believe that whoever tells him the words the Hound said does not tell him that there's a little girl traveling with this big man.

Â 
Yeah, he's pissed off, how do you think he's going to react to seeing Shae in his father's bed? Tyrion was certainly a darker character in the books but everything that happens at the end of aSoS is a result of him being extremely pissed off at everything.Â
1168	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-12	Â

Of course it's the same character but the stuff he was saying was pretty dark and ties into the Tyrion we see in aDwD

"Little girl" doesn't equal "Arya".Â  None of his sources in that area would have any idea who Arya was.
1170	basilisk312	2014-05-12	The necklace shown on the trial is not the one Ser Dontos gave to Sansa, Littlefinger used the handle of his dagger to smash that one on the ship,


Â 
sigh
1171	Gneisenau	2014-05-12	If Tyrion controlled his temper earlier on, (aka not threatening the King) his trials wouldn't have been anywhere near humiliating.
1172	Stark11	2014-05-12	I think Tyrion demanded trial by combat knowing Oberyn would defend him. In the show he knows Oberyns hated for the Lannisters (mainly Tywin) and helping Tyrion get free would not only piss off Tywin but also Cersei. And maybe Tyrion knows Cersei will choose The Mountain (bc he is "unbeatable"). Plus in the trailer for EP. 7 he says something that makes me think he knew how things would play out. 
Just a theory for the show.
1173	basilisk312	2014-05-12	No way Tywin kills Shae. It will be Tyrion, now that we've seen his dark side for the first time
And yet again another variant of the Rains of Castamere will be playing. Can they introduce the Dornishman's wife or something just so it's clear that Westeros has more than 2 songs?

Yes, he should have left Sansa to her fate and looked the other way when she got beaten, so inconsiderate of him.

1178	ckal	2014-05-12	Wow. While the story differs I think it is a great adaption. Adaption being the operative word there. ASOIAF could never be made into a television series or movie with out changes for SO many reason. Literally too many reasons to list, but the main one being that there are WAY too many characters in the books to fit into a screen adaption.
Is it still considered fanfic if the author is an executive producer?


Â 
There are sensical changes made for good reasons, and there are completely non sensical changes made for no logical reason at all.
Â 
Unfortunately, HBO's adaptation has more of the latter, not former. On top of cutting great scenes from the books that would enhance the show, time is used onÂ ill advised scenes with crappy 'characters' and 'plots' and many made up scenes which turn out to be dreadful, lacking any real impact. The best example of the entire series is probably when D&D applied their genious and thought it woul d be better for Cat to let Jaime go without even thinking her kids at Winterfell were dead, which was basicallyÂ her entire motivation from the books. Literally all they had to do was add 1 minute scene where she finds out before releasing Jaime, instead it results in a completely ridiculous and unebelievable ending.
Â 
Side complaint being HBO's adaptation is so over the top hit you in the face with things it leaves nothing to the imagination. Subetly is entirelyÂ lost with D&D, and I really think they aren't good enough writers over all to truly do ASOIAF justice, whereas more literarily competant writers/show runners may have.
Â 
Also, GRRM literally has zero say in the end on what the show does or doesn't do. Even as a writer on one episode per season, he still must stay within the established guidelines and do what D&D want him to. They also make changes to his scripts after the fact like adding, moving, or changes scenes. Even with the author as exec producer, D&D can still and do make up whatever they like. GRRM has no power here. The rights are sold and he must live with the decision as he has talked about so often in the past.

"And in his outburst, he inadvertently acts like how they all assume he is  this vengeful person.
Yeah. Finally after years of being laughed at and abused and beaten down by almost everybody in his life, Tyrion would rather go out armed with a sword and be brutally murdered than give into his father one more inch. Then the final shot is father and son staring each other down."
As a Jaime fan, I find this very interesting

Couldn't agree more. It's becoming so off base. That I can't even figure out a reason for the changes is frustrating. I truly wish that D&D would try to clarify some of them.

I'm not so sure if he knows Oberyn would defend him. So far, he's one of the judges and they haven't had the interaction they had in books.
Â

Â 
He was ok trying to defend her, but the way he did could have been more clever, specially knowing what kind of temper Joffrey and Cersei had. He's smarter than that.
1185	Carl Rhaego	2014-05-12	I hope those who always complain about Dany being perfect and flawless are happier now, because she looked like a total idiot in this episode. The son of a slavemaster claims his father was totally innocent in the deaths of the children and she believes him instantly because slave masters are such honest people who always say the truth, right? Giving in so easily will make her look weak and manipulable to the Meereense nobles.
Â 
Then the goat herder says Drogon killed all his livestock when we clearly saw that he only took single goat the rest got away. Of course Dany doesn't question this and promises him three times the worth of all his animals in gold. Barristan gives her a look like 'Are you stupid?'. She never asks for proof. How did the goat herder get the bones when Drogon carried his prey off into the far away mountains? Now when the word spreads that Dany is paying gold for animal bones, people can just burn their livestock, bring it to her and make some big cash (I think that's what happens in ADWD, correct me if I'm wrong), it was a really dumb move. They are really showing her as a bad and naive ruler from the moment she sits on the bench.
1186	Fool of a Book	2014-05-12	Nice episode overall, But I'm pretty confused about Shae's motivation to testify.

Either they are stillÂ going somewhere different with Shae or their decision to change her character so much has finally come back to bite them.Â 


Â 
Yes, she seemed coerced to state her lies about Tyrion and Sansa, with the obvious motivation being that Tywin promised Tyrion would be sent to the Wall, and not executed.
Â 
Unfortunately, no one gave Tyrion the memo. Â He seemed to believe Jaime wasn't lying, but did not trust that his father and Cersei would let him live so easily. Â "But that's what they promised Ned Stark!"
Â 
Anyway, it was pretty clear to me that the show writers have set up Shae's motivations are trying to protect Tyrion, no condemn him. Â Very deftly combining her bitterness with her concern.
Â 
Still weirded out about her lies about Sansa, however.
Â 


Does Varys know Arya is alive but he chooses not to reveal it? He had his "birds" find information on the Hound in the riverlands, insofar that they even knew word for word what the Hound said as he killed those soldiers.

Â 
It seemed crystal clear to me that Varys knew the Hound was travelling with Arya. Â By extension, seems crystal clear Varys knows exactly where Sansa is. Â I mean come on, what idiot in the Seven Kingdoms wouldn't put Sansa together with Petyr's newly appeared Bastard/Niece?

1188	StrollofShame	2014-05-12	The show is just making it clear that Varys will help Tyrion. I'd be interested in seeing if during the "Previously On..." they include this scene before Ep. 10 starts.Â 

I agree with this assessment. Wondered for a moment if LATER, this might not cast suspicion on V with Cersei--I believe this was show-only dialog. Guess she'll have her hands full soon & this exchange would be the least of her worries.

Holy wah! Drogon burned like the whole flock.. Who cares if he only brought the bones of one of them in, 80% of that's guys flock are all probably dead. I didn't think it was that hard to understand that. It doesn't matter that Drogon only took one goat, the rest were burned. 
Also since this is the first person to bring bones of livestock in I don't see why this guys would lie, he seemed scared shitless. I do agree that people will probably start brining in bones of whatever they can find though.

Â 
i didnt get that feeling...while they might know that the hound is not travelling alone, there is no one alive who has seen arya with the hound...at least no one who would recognize her to be a Stark...and the Hound left KL a long time after Arya did, no reason for them to suspect he would take her under his wing...
Â 
regarding Sansa at the Vale, to my knowledge, Varys does not seem to know anything about whats going on in there...there doesnt seem to be any communication between the Vale and the outside world, which is why they sent LF to bring them back in to the fold. Plus since Sansa just got there, it makes sense that new wouldn't have reached even Varys yet

Varys would presumably have sources in the Vale, as with everywhere else.Â  But there's no indication that Varys in the books has any idea where Sansa is, so this may be a case where the TV version is just going to have to look dumber as a result of the show's changes.

I doubt he was lying, and it's sort of ridiculous to call him that just to absolve Dany of making a mistake she shouldn't have made. If she has the time to sit on the throne and see over 200 people, she should have made the time to judge the Masters fairly. But instead she let emotions take control of her and she acted out of vengeance, and it is going to cost her dearly.
1198	Ser Eric	2014-05-12	Did Tywin know in the books that Joffrey, Tommen etc.. were born of incest between his children? The way he said "I want you to father children named Lannisters" seemed a bit suggestive.

Â 
The real, book-Ironborn, would have killed/maimed Ramsay and his dogs before he had a chance to open the kennel latch. Â I mean, Ramsay is just standing there talking, exposing his unarmed and nekkid chest with all those lovely vital organs, and no Ironborn throws an axe, a dagger, draws a bow and shoots an arrow? Â 
Â 
Unbelievable. Â 
Â 
But most of the episode was great, and Dinklage's Tyrion just killed it in the last few minutes (with help from Charles Dance, superb as usual). Â  Â
1200	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-12	I've always been a proponent of the fan theory that Tywin was poisoned by Oberyn via Widows Blood. I am curious to see if the show would ever confirm this theory. Interesting... that Pycelle name dropped Widows Blood and the conclusion of the scene between Jaime and Tywin, he-Tywin- takes a long sip of wine. It could mean nothing but that shot did strike me a bit odd. I wonder if they're gonna have Tywin start to show symptoms and Oberyn give his line that "your lord father won't live forever"...


Yes I am really hoping for some hints at that theory, as well as the Euron hiring a FM to kill Balon theory.Â
1201	JonInVa	2014-05-12	Not to bring up a sore and overdone topice, but was it just me or does Meryn F-ing Trant look a little too wimpy to have beaten Syrio, broken wooden sword or not, after all? He's like Rast with armor.

Â 
I think that's kinda the point though.Â  And IMO, Dany is probably most likeable when she's fucking up.Â  When things go well for her she gets a bit big-headed and obnoxious, but when things go poorly for her, the fundamentally decent side of her comes out and she's more sympathetic.
1203	soterakis	2014-05-12	I think that the show tries to redeem the Lannisters, specifially Tyrion and Jaime.Â 
Â 
Having watched the show, the first season portrayed their bad qualities, but now they both look a lot more human and caring.
Do you agree with this statement or do I sympathise with Tyrion just because of the unfair trial?
Â 
However, I think that the Lannisters will be annihilated in the future (maybe Cersei and her children) by their enemies.
There was a small hint at the Iron Bank of Braavos, regarding the age of Tywin, 67, which foreshadows that the realm is beyond its prime.
1204	Raksha 2014	2014-05-12	Did he stop Sansa's beating ? Blount still hit her.
Â 
Â 


Â 
Â 
Not after Tyrion entered the room. Â Though, as I remember, in the books, it was strongly implied that there other times, when Tyrion was not around, when Sansa was beaten by the Kingsguard.
1205	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-12	It's almost like horses are being changed mid stream. I know the Asha/Yara was big and unexpected to end last season but to hangs us out for 'What about your brother." " He s dead" was lame. I love a good fight , but that storyline to replace Kingsmoot? Now is she going to run around the north til Stannis shows, maybe Iron Born could head down to the Twins beat up the Freys for what they did to the King in the North.
Give me an hour of Tyrion and Jon and I'll be happy.


Who said that storyline meant no Kingsmoot? It was simply filler until they get to that point. Doesn't mean it will definitely happen (it better!) but it certainly doesn't rule it out either. That's AFFC material aka season 5.Â
1206	Warhawk137	2014-05-12	Because all slave-owners were terrible people who would crucify children, right? I doubt he was lying, and it's sort of ridiculous to call him that just to absolve Dany of making a mistake she shouldn't have made. If she has the time to sit on the throne and see over 200 people, she should have made the time to judge the Masters fairly. But instead she let emotions take control of her and she acted out of vengeance, and it is going to cost her dearly.


Â 
Side note, it's worth pointing out that whether he was lying or not is actually kind of irrelevant.Â  The point is that Dany, in her zeal, had not considered the possibility of the scenario that Hizdahr zo Loraq was presenting her.Â  Whether Hizzy's father, in particular, was actually a good dude doesn't make much difference, because the thrust of that scene in terms of Dany's characterization is that she struggles to conceptualize complex moral issues.

Yeah, we don't know whether Hizdahr's dad said those things or not, but Dany doesn't either, because she never bothered to look into the individual nature of the people she was crucifying.
1208	Greywolf2375	2014-05-12	Â  Cheers to that! And this..."The babies she wanted." is of course, Cersei's biggest triumphant manipulation of the system!
Â 
Personally I think that there won't be a witness. It will just be Sansa and Baelish. This is my guess for the last scene this season. Bye bye Lysa.


Â If it is just the two of them, how do they talk away the fact that Lysa is now dead?Â  Someone is going to get the blame for that - if it is just the two of them in the room it has to be one of them.
Â 


How the heck did Varys find "residue" of the strangler potion on the stones in Sansa's necklace? Â Did he have a microscope or other sophisticated lab equipment, or does the strangler potion have a particular color?


Â The same way it was found in the book - there was a purple smear in the necklace, in the show there probably was a blue smear.
Â 


Â 
Apparently.
Â 
Understanding that those passing judgement aren't at all concerned about justice, I'm confused as to what events are supposed to have transpired. Â Wherever Sansa and Dontos met up with LittleFinger, it took them hours to get there - yet apparently they were still close enough that Dontos's body was sure to be discovered.
Â 
Beyond that, what conclusion is one to draw from a dead Dontos with a crossbow bolt sticking out of his face and a poison necklace laying on his torso. Â That Sansa betrayed and killed him, then betrayed Tyrion and incriminated herself by leaving Joffrey's murder weapon on Dontos's corpse?


Â Agreed, this trial is for Tyrion and Sansa has been named, but given that they found the body (somehow) and the necklace it would seem important enough to bring up that she is still being looked for.
Â 


Â 
tywin is afraid that jaimie will be chosen by tyrion (and will accept) and that that's the end of the lannister line


Â why would Tywin be afraid Jaime will be chosen?Â  He only has one hand and even though no one is supposed to know how bad he is, everyone does know he was right handed.
1209	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-12	Yeah, we don't know whether Hizdahr's dad said those things or not, but Dany doesn't either, because she never bothered to look into the individual nature of the people she was crucifying.


Â 
goes with the look Barristan gave her when the goat herder came by...she's being foolish and just doing stuff to assuage her guilt...sh's never had to face the real consequences of her actions...cuz even in Astapor, she felt justified killing the slavers for killing infants...in yunkai got showered with Myhsa's....now she sees facing the consequences and she cant really handle it...hence, no need to investigate or find the truth...just give in to people's emotional manipulation, she'll do whatever it takes to not feel guiltyÂ
1210	Janicia	2014-05-12	Was anybody else nervous for Tommen during his speech? Â Introducing the trial seems to be his first act as king, it was very public, and things were already really tense. Â Given the things all the other kids do in the series, it wasn't that big of a deal, but in Tommen's life this would surely have been a scary major event and he pulled it off nicely. Â 
Â 
I'm looking forward to seeing what the show does with the Tommen Cersei dynamic. Â Because Joffrey was older in the show than in the book, the show gave him more self determination - he was doing things and ordering things done of his on volition that Cersei and Tywin didn't know about or approve of. Â Tommen, for all that he is a sweet kid, is serious about being king and will be trying to act kingly, which may put him into conflict with people wanting to use him as a puppet. Â Â

She doesn't know whether he did or he didn't, and now she never will. But she has made powerful enemies because of it and it will trouble her rule.
1212	ground_control	2014-05-12	Not to bring up a sore and overdone topice, but was it just me or does Meryn F-ing Trant look a little too wimpy to have beaten Syrio, broken wooden sword or not, after all? He's like Rast with armor.


Any boy whore with a sword could beat *three* Meryn Trants. Â Meryn Trant is 1/3 of a bow whore who always wears his brown pants. Â That was the Hound's point -- *anybody* in [the full plate armor of the KG] with a huge sword could have beaten Syrio (unarmored with a wooden sword).
1213	Carl Rhaego	2014-05-12	Because all slave-owners were terrible people who would crucify children, right? I doubt he was lying, and it's sort of ridiculous to call him that just to absolve Dany of making a mistake she shouldn't have made.

Â 
I wasn't trying to absolve Dany from a crime. I read so many critcisms of Dany being perfect and morally just and flawless on the show when actually that's not the case at all. That's what I was trying to say. They are showing her flaws. Some of these flaws are being too trustworthy and believing everything (like with Mirri Maz Duur, Xaro on the show, the Green Grace, it always ends up biting her in the ass) and being inexperienced and uneducated in ruling (the thing with gold for bones will create problems later), or white-black world views, were all demonstrated in the last episode.
Â 
Her darker, cruel side is also not white washed on the show. On the contrary, show Dany is IMO a darker and less sympathetic character than book Dany. The doubts and insecurites she has in the books are completely absent from the show. Example: in the books it is made clear that killing the masters was a rash emotional decision. In the show she is clearly calm and collected and never shows an ounce of doubt. In the books however, when she sees the masters dying on the crosses, she is horrified of what she's done. She is reminded of the atrocities at the Plaza of Punishment in Astapor and realizes that she has created a horror as big. No such concerns are ever presented in the show. Instead, she's standing on the balcony of the great pyramid with on ominous giant banner above her head and listening to the agonized dying screams of the men she just crucified, without being bothered by it, maybe even enjoying it. That is a much darker image of this scene and Dany's character in general than I ever got from the books.

1215	mamba12	2014-05-12	Not sure if it was already discussed, but does anyone have a clue who the guy sitting next to loras is? YT: Tyrion Breakdown

I thought they wouldn't have another Tyrell brother in the show, but his clothing indicates a tyrell connection.


Â 
In my headcannon, it's Garlan. But i'm pretty sure he's been cut. He's too big of a character to be a featured extra.

But this is a problem introduced by the show now being expanded on badly by the show. Â In the books, the slavers themselves choose the 163. Â If Hizdahr's dad was a "good slaver" but the other slavers chose him anyway, that's on them and Hizdahr should be mad at them.
Â 
I don't think we have hard numbers for slavers, but in a population the apparent size of Mereen, given that there was some sort of vote, all we need to assume to conclude that the punishment was fair and just is that there were at least 325 (so that a majority would have to include 163 pro-child-crucificiers).

1220	jons nissa	2014-05-12	The weirdest bit was Sansa's necklace. We saw Littlefinger crush Sansa's necklace, so how the hell did Pycell get it or one that looked exactly like it? In that Rolling Stone interview with GRRM there was this:
Â 
That killing happens early in this fourth season. The books, of course, are well past the poisoning of King Joffrey.Â In the books â<U+0080><U+0093> andÂ I make no promises, because I have two more books to write, and I may have more surprises to reveal â<U+0080><U+0093> the conclusion that the careful reader draws is that Joffrey was killed by the Queen of Thorns, using poison from Sansa's hairnet, so that if anyone did think it was poison, then Sansa would be blamed for it. Sansa had certainly good reason for it.
Â 
Doesn't it sound like GRRM is hinting there's more to Joffrey's poisoning than we suspect? Last week when Cersei asked Margaery if she still wanted to be Queen I thought, what the fuck? Wouldn't it be a real pisser if Cersei was in on the poisoning? It's a crazy idea I know, but Tyrion says, "if there's one person I'm sure of that didn't kill Joffrey it's Cersei." That's just too good of a line to not be true. Oh the irony! Think about it. Cersei was losing control of Joffrey, and there's also this from the Rolling Stones interview:
Â 
I don't know if somebody like Jaime or Cersei can be redeemed. Cersei's a great character â<U+0080><U+0093> she's like Lady Macbeth.Â Well, redeemed in whose eyes? She'll never be redeemed in the eyes of some. She's a character who's very protective of her children. You can argue, well,Â does she genuinely love her children,Â or does she just love them because they're herÂ children? There's certainly a great level of narcissism in Cersei.
Â 
I would argue that Cersei viewed Joffrey as "hers", and when he wasn't "hers" anymore, she wanted him dead. 


Â 
interesting quotes from grrm. it definitely makes one want to go back and review things to see if perhaps there are other conclusions that one can arrive at but is there really a belief that cersei killed joff because he wasn't hers? that's hard to swallow. i think he's saying she only loves them because she sees them as an extension of herself and if that is the case, she wouldn't stop thinking that because he married another woman. he clearly didn't love anyone but yes, he seemed to be under marg's influence and cersei hated that. but it seems quite a stretch to say she hated it to the point of wanting him dead. but who else would have done it????
Â 


They really highlighted Stannis weakness. He is king by right it is his duty. He will beg of no one. Not even the Iron Bank after he was crushed in battle. It's his only play but regardless he won't bow to anyone. Back the one true king or he doesn't need you. Except he needs almost everything at this point. No money. Small army. Few allegiances.


Â

It was never fair nor just to pick out 163 people and crucify them as a 'lesson' without doing at least SOME investigation. Even in the book, having a 'vote' doesn't mean that the people who were responsible were the ones who got crucified. The show can't tell us what's in Dany's mind, including her second thoughts when she sees them, so they've given us a situation where we can see her having second thoughts.Dany made a mistake and the show did a great job of highlighting it.

Â 
The "girl" could be anyone, though, there is no reason why anyone would think it's Arya Stark.
Â 
Sansa shows up exactly in the most logical place...the Vale, where her last known relative is, along with LF, who had talked up his "relationship" with both Tully daughters for years. Â And she is going to be more recognizable as a high born niece with red hair than Arya who will appear as some grubby peasant.
Â 
I agree though it's a bit of a stretch for the book too, that the dyed hair apparently fools everyone.
1231	BlueDragon	2014-05-12	Dany is obviously in over her head and making mistakes right and left. Â This is not the same thing as saying she is immoral or going dark although the scenes mentioned above sure emphasize that.
Â 
Hidzzy is not a reliable narrator. Â I think the show used him to make a point and give him some sympathy factor for the viewers while demonstrating Dany's mistake.
Â 
As far as I am concerned, all slavers in a slaving community are guilty. Â If you don't understand how I could take that position, read Ursula K. LeGuin's "The Ones Who Walk away from Omelas"
Â 
There is no such thing as a good slave master. Â 
Â 
Dany obviously has a lot to learn, but she is wise enough to know she is not ready for Westeros.
Â 
I love the way DWD ended. Â She learned a lot during that alone time with Drogon. Â She is going to be different when we see her next.

So many people are keeping an eye out for Arya, and a girl of her age and looks is travelling with Sandor and helping him kill those sworn to the King....
Â 
Then, even Sandor figures out the logical place for the girls is in the Vale. Â Is he smarter than Brienne? Â (tv comparison - why did Brienne think Sansa went to the Wall, when she has a living Aunt in a safe place?).
Â 
Honestly, never made any sense to my how Arya had so much exposure during her travels with the Hound, and no one ever figured out Sansa might head to the Vale (in the books) especially since several nobles met Petyr's suddenly-existing "bastard."

Everyone thinks she's dead. Â No one knew she had a sword or any martial arts training. Â So, after the first round of searches shortly after she disappeared, people stopped looking for her, she never turned up anywhere, she was very young, so: dead. Â And, she now dresses like a boy and behaves like a peasant and kills people...nothing that anyone would associate with Arya Stark. Â So, I am okay with all of that.
Â 
You're right that it is a plot fail in the books that no one apparently ever bothers to check on the mysterious out of nowhere daughter that LF picks up at exactly the moment Sansa disappears.
1236	Colonel Green	2014-05-12	If she kills him (were she desperate enough and able), she kills most of the proof that she is innocent which might be squeezed out of him. Â 


What "proof", really?Â  And proof is really not of much use to her -- even if she convinced the Lannisters she wasn't involved, they'd still lock her back up in King's Landing and arrange a new marriage for her.Â  She wouldn't ever want to go to them anyway.
Â 

Her potential allies are Varys, Marg and Olenna, but she wouldn't know that.Â  

Margaery, maybe, but Olenna either agreed to give her to Littlefinger in the first place or wanted her sitting next to Tyrion in the prisoner's box (or possibly sitting there solo).Â  She's no friend of Sansa's.
Â 


So many people are keeping an eye out for Arya, and a girl of her age and looks is travelling with Sandor and helping him kill those sworn to the King....


People are not keeping an eye out for Arya.Â  The common sense opinion is that Arya is dead as a doornail, as Jaime pointed out.Â  Moreover, there are tons of girls Arya's age with approximately Arya's appearance (which is all any of Varys' agents would be going on), all through the continent.Â  There's no earthly reason for anybody who doesn't know who Arya is already to assume that the Hound is traveling with Arya Stark.

Â 
So the Hound being spotted slaughtering some King's knights is noted by Varys, but not the fact that a girl around the age and with the looks of Arya (body never found) is with him and participated? Â Reference here is mostly the TV version and Varys' intel at the Council meeting.
Â 
Not being snarky, just saying. Â Whoever witnessed the Hound saying "Fluck the King" surely reported the girl with him. Â Why would the Hound be travelling with a random girl?
Â 
So I think Varys knows.
Â

1238	BlueDragon	2014-05-12	What "proof", really?Â  And proof is really not of much use to her -- even if she convinced the Lannisters she wasn't involved, they'd still lock her back up in King's Landing and arrange a new marriage for her.Â  She wouldn't ever want to go to them anyway.
Â 
They can't do new marriage as Tyrion escapes and the church is not going along with that. Â 
Â 
Margaery, maybe, but Olenna either agreed to give her to Littlefinger in the first place or wanted her sitting next to Tyrion in the prisoner's box (or possibly sitting there solo).Â  She's no friend of Sansa's.
Â 
No way did Olenna want Sansa caught in that way. Â She is clever, not mean to innocents. Â This is one of the mysteries of who did what with the poison and when. Â

1239	sj4iy	2014-05-12	Dany is obviously in over her head and making mistakes right and left. This is not the same thing as saying she is immoral or going dark although the scenes mentioned above sure emphasize that.Hidzzy is not a reliable narrator. I think the show used him to make a point and give him some sympathy factor for the viewers while demonstrating Dany's mistake.Agreed.Â As far as I am concerned, all slavers in a slaving community are guilty. If you don't understand how I could take that position, read Ursula K. LeGuin's "The Ones Who Walk away from Omelas"There is no such thing as a good slave master.Wrong. Most 'slave masters' are products of their time and environment. That doesn't make them bad people. You can be a good man and a slave master. Actually, you would hope that slaves had good men as masters over bad men. But basically, all nobility owned slaves, therefore making them slave masters. It's basically condemning people for being born rich. Slavery is a terrible institution, but you can't make sweeping statements about any group, no matter who they are or what they do.Â Dany obviously has a lot to learn, but she is wise enough to know she is not ready for Westeros.I love the way DWD ended. She learned a lot during that alone time with Drogon. She is going to be different when we see her next.Hopefully.

Yeah, I think this week's small council meeting, while CLEARLY mostly about Mace Tyrell being made Master Of Ships  also reintroduced the idea that Jorah was an informant.Â  I like the idea floated earlier in this thread (I think? maybe i read it elsewhere) that Tywin is going to have Varys's birds rat Jorah out to Dany by publishing some old letters 
Â 
A story which the honorable and honest Barristan will then confirm when Dany asks him to confirm/deny this, and then the HSS Friendzone is Sunk. 

I was watching the HBO foreshawdowing and there is a brief clip of Ser Friendzone (LOVE that nickname) standing in front of Dany in her throne room.  Since that scene hasn't happened yet, I think it is her confronting Jorah about his spying. I will look at the clip again find the exact time of it.
1241	Colonel Green	2014-05-12	So the Hound being spotted slaughtering some King's knights is noted by Varys, but not the fact that a girl around the age and with the looks of Arya (body never found)?


Why would Varys' agents in the upper Riverlands have any idea what Arya Stark looks like?Â  It's not like they have photos.Â  The girl isn't noteworthy at all, whereas Clegane is a wanted fugitive.
Â 
In any event, unless the agent was the innkeeper or his daughter, most likely Varys' agent was merely relaying their account of what happened.
Â 

Â 
And yes, the books never explain how stupid the nobles of the Vale are. re: Sansa/Alayne.

It's hinted that Royce, at least, actually does know who she is.

Â 
OK I get it. Â But why would Varys have a report about the Hound, without the girl with him? Â Why would Varys NOT speculate the identity of a girl travelling with the ex-kingsguard through the Riverlands, killing those sworn to the King?

There is simply no reason whatsoever to make a connection between a traveling companion of the Hound (if she made it into the report at all) and Arya Stark.Â  The only "interaction" between them, so to speak, was him killing Mycah, and that would, if anything, weigh strongly against a connection between them.Â  Arya Stark vanished more than a year before the Hound left the city.Â  Westeros is the size of Latin America.

In the books â<U+0080><U+0094> and I make no promises, because I have two more books to write, and I may have more surprises to reveal â<U+0080><U+0094> the conclusion that the careful reader draws is that Joffrey was killed by the Queen of Thorns, using poison from Sansaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s hair net, so that if anyone actually did think it was poison, then Sansa would be blamed for it. Sansa had certainly good reason for it.

That is what I said. Â Slavery was not based on race till New World slavery arrived on the scene.Â

But slavery in Westeros has been abolished, or never used?

Slavery in this story is appears only in Essos, where the colored people live. Â 
Â 
But even Dany was enslaved as a woman and Cersei certainly feels that she has been used as a broodmare, as a slave, in effect. Â I agree with her on that point. Â Women in Westeros are kept in line through the threat of rape just the way they are kept in line on Earth through the threat of rape. Â

Slavery and gender abuse clearly overlaps in the novels.

I don't expect people who lived hundreds or thousands of years ago in medieval societies where might makes right to know or care much about 'human rights'. It's ludicrous to expect them to be enlightened and then judge them based on that.Â And slavery was not based on color of skin till we got to the Americas, and by we, I mean Western civilization.I grew up in the South...i'm very aware of the horrors and atrocities that happened to those of color, and in my ancestry I have both slave owners and slaves, as well as people who fought on both sides of the Civil War. Knowing the history very thoroughly, I know that most slaves were treated like property and degraded. But you can't assert that EVERY PERSON in the ENTIRE HISTORY OF THE WORLD who ever owned a slave was a terrible and cruel person. Most people are products of their times, just as we are. I'm sure 100 years from now, people will look back on us and try to paint us with the brush of 'ignorant savages', but that's not fair nor just.All Dany had to do was inquire as to who was actually responsible for crucifying the children. That's ALL she had to do to be justified in her actions. She didn't. If she wants to punish the slave masters for any crimes they committed, then she should have given them trials. Instead, she enacted vengeance against the advice of the men who know more than she does about these matters, and ended up making a mistake that costs her much in the long run.

So many people are keeping an eye out for Arya, and a girl of her age and looks is travelling with Sandor and helping him kill those sworn to the King....
Â 
Then, even Sandor figures out the logical place for the girls is in the Vale. Â Is he smarter than Brienne? Â (tv comparison - why did Brienne think Sansa went to the Wall, when she has a living Aunt in a safe place?).
Â 
Honestly, never made any sense to my how Arya had so much exposure during her travels with the Hound, and no one ever figured out Sansa might head to the Vale (in the books) especially since several nobles met Petyr's suddenly-existing "bastard."


I don't think it matters where Brienne is headed, she gets intercepted by unCat. Maybe they wanted to avoid confusion between both Sandor-Arya and Brienne-Pod heading to the Vale and never meeting. May be some bounty hunters get the hound and Arya escapes, or the hears of Lysa's death and Arya escape and leaves to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea/Braavos.

Dinner is coming;
1283	espresso	2014-05-12	Â 
Sansa shows up exactly in the most logical place...the Vale, where her last known relative is, along with LF, who had talked up his "relationship" with both Tully daughters for years. Â And she is going to be more recognizable as a high born niece with red hair than Arya who will appear as some grubby peasant.
Â 
I agree though it's a bit of a stretch for the book too, that the dyed hair apparently fools everyone.


I wondered that too. A very beautiful girl with blue eyes and who clearly acts like a highborn lady.
Â 
However, the people she interacted with so far have not met Sansa Stark. If Bronze Yohn didn't identify her, we can't expect others to. If(won't LF do something about it?) Varys had little birds in the Vale, they will tell him and he can easily guess. Why, even without news from the Vale Varys can figure out who shipped out Sansa Stark. But Varys is better off keeping the last known heir to the North safe and alive than throw her to the Lannisters' mouth. If Aegon is going to fight Lannisters, he will need to overthrow the Boltons too. And Sansa Stark alive with LF is better than her having executed in KL.
1284	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-12	Re watching...
I missed the fact that Oberyn is the only one who doesn't stand when Tywin walks in, he notices but says nothing...love that
And noticed his interested look at the mention of Jorah...agreed, it is suspicious


Â 
In the whole episode, there was not even one fuck given by Oberyn. Not even literally, apparently.
Â 


Â 
next week.Â  bedroom scene again.Â  Myranda is in the mood, starts undressing, gets as far as at least one boob out because HBO (I mean, let's be honest here).
Â 
Ramsay:Â  "No, no, sorry Myranda, not tonight.Â  I have work in the morning.Â  It's a long journey to Moat Cailin and I have to wake up bright and early to get on the road in time!Â  And that means YOU [*BOOP*s her nose with his finger] need to get some sleep tonight too.Â  Tomorrow's a very big day for you, too!"
Â 
[Myranda smiles]
Â 
Ramsay:Â  "I have a very special going away present for you and I want to give it to you in person before I have to say goodbye!"
Â 
Myranda [sultry cooing]Â  "ooh, I can't wait."
Â 
[Ramsay BIG GRIN]
Â 
Cut to tomorrow, and *TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT*
Â 
And the braying of the hounds, as Ramsay lets slip their leashes and they bound after a scampering, half-naked Myranda.
Â 
Ramsay:Â  "Goodbye, Myranda!"


Â 
I wish I could say goodbye to some ex boyfriends in that way.
1285	Warhawk137	2014-05-12	Â 
That is what I said. Â Slavery was not based on race till New World slavery arrived on the scene.Â 
Â 
But slavery in Westeros has been abolished, or never used?
Â 
Slavery in this story is appears only in Essos, where the colored people live. Â 
Â 
But even Dany was enslaved as a woman and Cersei certainly feels that she has been used as a broodmare, as a slave, in effect. Â I agree with her on that point. Â Women in Westeros are kept in line through the threat of rape just the way they are kept in line on Earth through the threat of rape. Â 
Â 
Slavery and gender abuse clearly overlaps in the novels.


Â 
To a point, a feudal system reduces the need for outright slavery, particularly insofar as the country is both relatively insular and mostly united.Â  Not that it prevented it in the real world by any means, though it was actually fairly uncommon in the pre-colonialist era, but the point is that the economy of Westeros doesn't really lend itself to slavery, particularly considering the population is fairly homogenous, to the extent that it does in Essos, which is constituted of ethnically and culturally diverse city-states that are often in conflict and, generally, are less isolationist.

1286	Salad Days Saan	2014-05-12	Thats pretty grim. I kinda like Myranda cuz shes like "yeah im the Dreadette and its awe~some. I love to be bad. I love to be bad~~ Im a Dreadette. The best bet~ I love the hunt and i love the chase~ I love to be bad!! Make no mistake, i raise those stakes~ " *beatbox*


Â 
Well, SOMEBODY needs to start droppin' rhymes at the Dreadfort, anyway 
Â 
But, while maybe not next week, I think this is Myranda's future eventually.Â  The dynamic of the hunt just seemed too familiar and almost cyclical.Â  One girl got jealous of the other, so Ramsay picked one and had her help hunt the other.Â  Once there's a third again, and the triangle gets re-established.
Â 
She's the accomplice for now, but she's not the first such GF for Ramsay, just the most recent, and she thinks it's forever like all too many girls believe about all too many boys, except way worse in this case because this boy doesn't just hit and quit, he MURDERS you.
Â 
Plus Roose is gonna want Ramsay to quit fooling around with her and focus on his Pretend Arya bride (or whatever the show version of that ends up being) so either Ramsay gets rid of her his way, or Roose gets rid of her his way, and neither way is a pleasant end for Myranda, who'll be the last one to see her own end coming.

Man...i want her to stay. Fuck the police.Â Or she mutinies or something. I dunno.Â If shes to go byebye, at least let her have one more really evil act first.
1288	ipsuel	2014-05-12	Why dont they "Rhyonar of the First men" anymore? None, Stannis, Dany or Tommen...I always found that the most fascinating
Remember the first time Ned Stark says it...


Â 
They've never included it in the show. I re-watched s01e01 the other day, and he definitely does not include the Rhyonar reference (only the Andals and the First Men). Kinda sucks, I agree. It could've been a nice little way to explain Nymeria's name.Â
1289	Queen Ayras Lord Commander	2014-05-12	Â 
Oberyn's one of my favorite characters in the book, too. Â Pascal is doing a fine job; and I love his profile. (he's built nicely too)
Â 
Has anyone noticed that Cersei's hairstyle has much improved since the Purple Wedding; she looks even more attractive without that high-piled look; and her amazing cheekbones are more visible.


Â 
Can't lie, best she's ever looked.
1290	Newstar	2014-05-12	Â 
Can't lie, best she's ever looked.


Â 
I think all the women have looked more attractive this season. Shae was luminous in the trial scene, Carice van Houten looked even more stunning than usual in that scene from the 4x07 promo where she gazed into the flames, and Margaery has looked incredible.

1296	ground_control	2014-05-12	looool. Im wondering if Michelle Fairley is coming back and just keeping it under her hat...


Well, she's in the new 24 series and it's looking like the directors just told her, "you'll still be playing Cat, but Walder Frey is now the President of the U.S."
1297	SerMixalot	2014-05-12	With regards to Varys' motivations, in season 1 when he and the magistrate meet beneath the catacombs, I believe Viserys was still alive and therefore, I believe the rightful heir to the targaryan throne.Â  When Viserys died, the next male heir was (f)Aegon.Â  So Varys is just adapting to changing situations.
1298	Daenor	2014-05-12	With regards to Varys' motivations, in season 1 when he and the magistrate meet beneath the catacombs, I believe Viserys was still alive and therefore, I believe the rightful heir to the targaryan throne.Â  When Viserys died, the next male heir was (f)Aegon.Â  So Varys is just adapting to changing situations.


Nope that's not correct.The proper order is Aegon-Viserys-Dany. Aegon was the son of the mad King's heir and according to the Targaryen customs/laws he comes first.
By the way sorry to post it here but the trailer for episode 7 is up http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones#/video/video.html/eNrjcmbOYM7XLMtMSc13zEvMqSzJTHbOzytJrShRz89JgQkFJKan+iXmpjIXcjIysoFgellmarltXmlOjlpiaUl+QU5ipW1JUWmqGtAoW0Njc3MLCwu1tMycktQi27TUxJLSotQUAMrtJLY=Â

PS Westeros is way bigger than Latin America! Â GRRM says it's roughly the length of South America.

So...it's SMALLER than Latin America.
1303	Janicia	2014-05-12	Â 
From a thousand pages ago, but I still like the idea of Salladhor being used as "Aurane Waters" stand-in. So a Stannis betrayal of him could work in that way. Runs over to Cersei. Promptly betrays her too.Â 


Â 
Or Davos and Salladhor could fake Salladhor changing sides so that Salladhor could steal Cersei's fleet. Â He did want to **** Cersei in season 2...Â 
Â 
But I don't think Cersei would trust him and I don't think he would trust Cersei to be dumb enough to trust him. Â
1304	The Dragon has three heads	2014-05-12	Yara at the dread fort.

Pfft.
1305	nara	2014-05-12	I repeat, to both the Unsullied and to the Book Readers... what moron in the seven kingdoms wouldn't question Petyr's sudden bastard/niece?
Â 
Maybe this is a book flaw that the show writers are trying to resolve?Â 


I always believed that since LF is known to own a brothel, everyone assumed that he partook of his own wares and she's the result.Â  And now that she's flowered, LF no longer wants her living in the brothel.
Â 


Just watched the episode.
Â 
Laughing at Stannis again. He can't even convince the bank to give him money, Davos must do it. Ridic.


Â 
I actually thought it was appropriate.Â  Stannis has many great qualities (strategic, smart, brave, persistent, etc.) but winning friends and influencing people is not one of his strengths.Â  Convincing the bank required an influencer--and Davos (who, as a smuggler, has probably had to talk his way out of many difficult situations) is a great one.
Â 


the best part of the whole episode was just how slumped and relaxed oberyn was during most of the trial


Â 
It was hilarious, but I was actually a little annoyed when he didn't stand when Tywin entered the room in the Small Council scene.Â  It seemed a little discourteous and passive aggressive to me...
Â 

Hey...i was just thinking...do you think Ramsay's lady friend, Myranda will actually be plot important? I kinda like how shes unabashedly bad news. Goes to show even the ladies can be pretty gnarly.

Nope, just Ros replacement as token naked woman.Â  I actually don't like her, because I always assumed that Ramsay was a solo player and that everyone else in the Dreadfort was just too afraid to challenge him or say anything.Â  The show is taking a different approach, and I don't really care for it.
1306	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-12	I hope those who always complain about Dany being perfect and flawless are happier now, because she looked like a total idiot in this episode. The son of a slavemaster claims his father was totally innocent in the deaths of the children and she believes him instantly because slave masters are such honest people who always say the truth, right? Giving in so easily will make her look weak and manipulable to the Meereense nobles.
Â 
Then the goat herder says Drogon killed all his livestock when we clearly saw that he only took single goat the rest got away. Of course Dany doesn't question this and promises him three times the worth of all his animals in gold. Barristan gives her a look like 'Are you stupid?'. She never asks for proof. How did the goat herder get the bones when Drogon carried his prey off into the far away mountains? Now when the word spreads that Dany is paying gold for animal bones, people can just burn their livestock, bring it to her and make some big cash (I think that's what happens in ADWD, correct me if I'm wrong), it was a really dumb move. They are really showing her as a bad and naive ruler from the moment she sits on the bench.

Excellent, just like the books
1307	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-12	"It was hilarious, but I was actually a little annoyed when he didn't stand when Tywin entered the room in the Small Council scene.  It seemed a little discourteous and passive aggressive to me..."
It was meant to be, he hates Tywin and has no problem showing it!
1308	Janicia	2014-05-12	I thought Varys answer , this:
Tyrion asks Varys if he has forgotten his promise to remember that Tyrion saved the city from Stannis;Varys says that he never forgets a thing.
...oddly vague , as if he ducked accusing Tyrion of anything.
I would have look in the book to see what Varys says at the trial, since his actions are Tyrion friendly later.


Wow, I totally missed that interpretation. Â Varys may have been referring to the wizard-in-a-box scene in which Tyrion confided his suspicion that Cersei had tried to have him killed during the Battle of Blackwater and asked Varys to provide him with evidence. Â And then Tyrion talked about wanting to get revenge against the people who were trying to hurt him. Â Bringing that up would have been pretty damning and Varys kept quiet abut it. Â 
Â 
Varys also could have mentioned that Tyrion fought with Joffrey over the siege preparations (Joffrey wanted to go after Robb instead of preparing for Stannis' attack). Varys probably also knew that Tyrion was blackmailing Lancel in season 2, but it isn't explicit in the show that Varys knew about that. Â 
Â 
So Varys limited his testimony to things that were common knowledge on the Small Council; he kept back the things that nobody knew to ask him for. Â 
Â 
Â 
I don't fully understand the Varys / Oberyn scene. Â It seemed like they were tentatively reaching for a mutually beneficial arrangement with each other, but it didn't get to the point of specifics. Â Varys harped on class distinctions, I guess to differentiate himself from the Kings Landing crowd that Oberyn despises; and Oberyn was trying to figure out what makes Varys tick. Â Have we seen Varys tell somebody that he didn't trust them before? Â What was the point of saying that to Oberyn?
Â 
Somebody said upthread that Oberyn and Ellaria's decision to stay in the brothel and talk to the prostitutes is probably an intentional intelligence gathering activity; so Oberyn's invitation to Varys to join them may have been intended as a "lets compare notes and scheme in private" kind of offer. Â Or maybe in the show universe they are in cahoots and this was just a cautious check-in (seems unlikely)?

I know, but somehow I would respect him more for directly confronting Tywin vs. acting out this way.Â  May be projecting from real life...

LOL, I agree. I like Dany but they portray her naive and already regretting her decisions. I would probably take my people and sail to Westeros in her place. She's staying though. I respect that.

I thought it was about telling the audience, not Oberyn, that Varys did trust Tyrion - (basing this on the wizard in the box)- and that despite the evidence he would give at the trial,Â  he would help Tyrion in the future. Also echoed by his answer to Tyrion - I remember everything

Â 
The trial was ok but the "trial by combat" moment seems odd - unless I missed something they chose to have no setup of that moment that would make Tyrion look less crazy/stupid?Â  I guess you could assume he talked to the Viper off-screen, but more likely they'll tack on that conversation after the fact, along with a re-introduction to Clegane.Â

He's not crazy or stupid, he's just snapped, because having Shae come out to throw him under the bus is unnecessarily (since he's already framed).Â  It's not about keeping up the appearance of the trial, having Shae come in is just insult to injury, making it truly personal.Â  If the trial is burying him, Shae's testimony is Cersei pissing on his grave afterwards.
Â 
Now it's about Fucking Up Dad's Master Plan On Principle (and out of spite) as much as it is Trying To Survive.

All of which would be great except it's a reach to assume he even knows about Dad's Master Plan.
Â 
I mean sure, you could assume he's thinking all that, but any kind of evidence of what he was thinking would've made for a smarter Tyrion, which was a nice aspect of the trial in the books - the combination of his emotion and his intelligence.Â  The latter is kind of missing in this scene/episode, though I guess they can fill it in later.

Well, he doesn't know what specifically the plan is, but he does know that there IS one because Jaime pretty much told him there was, and that Tyrion's role in it is supposed to be roll over and play dead.Â  That's enough for him to know he can fuck it up and how to.

I think what happened was Shae was gonna leave, but Tywin ordered all ships to be seized afterJoff's death, and then Shae gets found.
1320	MarieAntoinette	2014-05-12	This episode combined both awesome and bad scenes. Yara's rescue attempt especially after her big speech was really awful. I did not mind the Craster's keep filler, but these added scenes were just extremely bad. Kudos to PD for his trial speech, he nailed it. I'm so excited for Tywin's death, I'm pretty sure that PD and CD last conversation is going to be a highlight of this season.
1321	Mithras	2014-05-13	Yara's night raid to Dreadfort was the most ridiculous thing ever done in the GoT.

1324	DormeDwayne	2014-05-13	Yara's night raid to Dreadfort was the most ridiculous thing ever done in the GoT.


Â 
Interesting - I didn't find it so. The Craster stuff last episode I found pointless and ridiculous, but the Dreadfort insert didn't bother me at all. It showed us how drastically Theon has been broken better (and more economically, time-wise) than could otherwise have been done in the show, as opposed to books.
Â 
I do agree that the dogs were a bit ridiculous - it's not like they are immortal  It would be much more credible if the Ironborn ran because they've been found out and were obviously far outnumbered, once the garrison was awake and aware of their presence.Â

Interesting - I didn't find it so. The Craster stuff last episode I found pointless and ridiculous, but the Dreadfort insert didn't bother me at all. It showed us how drastically Theon has been broken better (and more economically, time-wise) than could otherwise have been done in the show, as opposed to books.

Â 
It wasn't just the dogs, but shirtless Ramsey Van Damme was just plain silly as well.
Â 
Personally, I'd preferred it if Yara had managed to get a skittish Theon back to the boats, with Ramsey and his men off in the distance in pursuit, only to have Theon step back announce to Yara and her men that Theon Greyjoy had died. He then runs back to his captors. It's the only way I can rationalize Yara actually leaving Theon behind after her big speeches and her boat trip around Westeros to save her brother. What they had onscreen, I just didn't buy.

It's possible, of course, but why include something that would be so completely lost on show viewers who haven't read the books? He might have been thinking of Cersei and Jaime, Lysa and Littlefinger, even Shae and Tyrion (show-wise).

Â 
It's been said already, but I think how dangerous attack dogs are is being underestimated. Go for the throat, rip a chunk out of an ankle, latch on to the weapon hand, or go for the balls. All they really need to do is enough to divert the victim's attention for a second for a man to get a hit in. It's not about the dogs winning the fight by themselves, but about giving an advatage.Â The dogsÂ aren't necessarily expected to survive just as long as they distract the enemy.
Â 
As importantly in those days animals are going to be much more feared by people. Even if you put the thought of rabies aside, without antibiotics a bite from a dog living in its own filthÂ could easilyÂ turn septic and the victimelose a limb or die anyway from infection even if you escaped (although no idea if the writers would have considered that).

Â 
Â 
Theon's bite could be pretty dangerous to Yara as well; especially since he was probably kept in more filthy conditions than the dogs (I imagine that Ramsay took better care of his "girls", and at least had them taken outside the cages to relieve themselves). Â But the dogs never should have been a threat at all; if Yara & Co. hadn't just stood there gawking while Ramsay brandished the key and discussed his intentions.

Â 
That is right. And in the book if I recall well it was common for people to come and ask compensation for the destruction that the dragons did, so they had to establish that somehow.
I don't think they will whitewash the dragons. After all they are beasts.

We can say for sure this end of season is gonna kill the Internet.


Â 
You are right. Oberyn dying, the battle at the Wall and Tywin's death will bring the Internet down.
When UnCat makes her appearance we will have a global catastrophe. And the argument about whether Ned, Robb or anybody else who died until now in the TV series will start all over again for the TV viewers this time.
1339	gmavridis	2014-05-13	Â 
In the books, the killing of livestock and Dany's payments came before the killing of a child.Â  It's an escalation of violence by the dragons OR maybe the same level of violence but perceived differently because a child cannot be replaced with gold.


Â 
That is right. There was an escalation and until the child's bones are revealed they all think that he is just another sheepherder looking for money for his goats

Â 
LOL, good point about the Theon bite!
Â 
I felt it was a bit of a stand-off at that point when they are looking at each other. Carry on fighting and most of us will die on both sides or we both call it square, and live to fight another day. Ramsay's threat of the dogs just tipped them into retreat since the Ironborn had no reason to stay at that point anyway.
1341	Fool of a Book	2014-05-13	Wow, I totally missed that interpretation. Â Varys may have been referring to the wizard-in-a-box scene in which Tyrion confided his suspicion that Cersei had tried to have him killed during the Battle of Blackwater and asked Varys to provide him with evidence. Â And then Tyrion talked about wanting to get revenge against the people who were trying to hurt him. Â Bringing that up would have been pretty damning and Varys kept quiet abut it. Â 
Â 
Varys also could have mentioned that Tyrion fought with Joffrey over the siege preparations (Joffrey wanted to go after Robb instead of preparing for Stannis' attack). Varys probably also knew that Tyrion was blackmailing Lancel in season 2, but it isn't explicit in the show that Varys knew about that. Â 
Â 
So Varys limited his testimony to things that were common knowledge on the Small Council; he kept back the things that nobody knew to ask him for. Â 
Â 


Â 
I agree, and this is well-stated!
Â 


Â 
noÂ My giant of Lannister line though..


Â 
It's almost similar to the above re: Varys' selective testimony. Â I do think the showrunners are trying to keep Shae a sympathetic character, for reasons. Â I wouldn't be surprised if we see a scene where Shae tries to explain herself "I was only trying to save your life, they said you would go to the Wall..."
Â 
And then Tyrion can call her a lying whore again and get back to business.
1342	W1NT3RF3LL	2014-05-13	Does anyone find any relation with how the hound and arya are portrayed to that of dunk and egg?  I dont know, to me it just seems very similar.  Obviously the story is not evem close but the whole concept of a big knight with a small kid traveling along with him.  Just a thought.
1343	johndance	2014-05-13	Was very hard to believe that the Shae-character from the show could really be so stupid as to not understand Tyrion sent her off for good reason.Â  All this to get revenge?Â  The character was always kind of stupid but I'm bummed they're now trying to course-correct into the book's ending.Â  You could also say that Shae is playing a double-game trying to keep Tyrion alive... but again of late they've been leaving things pretty unsaid.Â  Hoping they don't try to fit it into the book-Shae-plot.
Â 
The trial was ok but the "trial by combat" moment seems odd - unless I missed something they chose to have no setup of that moment that would make Tyrion look less crazy/stupid?Â  I guess you could assume he talked to the Viper off-screen, but more likely they'll tack on that conversation after the fact, along with a re-introduction to Clegane.Â 


Â 
I think you missed the part where Jaime tells Tyrion to keep his mouth shut because he spoke with Tywin and found out his life is going to be spared and he will be sent to the wall. So now Tyrion knows Tywin's plan. He just gets to a breaking point with Shae and decides screw it, 'I've been treated unfairly by my father for my entire life and this is the last straw. Screw him. I'll risk my life to completely stick it to him and mess up whatever plan he has' Â He definitely hasn't talked with Oberyn yet because it hasn't been said that the Mountain will be the one chosen to fight against Tyrion. It's only when Oberyn finds out that the Mountain is the one picked that he decides to fight for Tyrion.
1344	White Harbors Wrath	2014-05-13	Â

Â 
That actually hadn't occurred to me yet...IF UnCat appears...speculation of every single killed cast member returning to life will be unbearable through the duration of the series.
1345	'96Buck	2014-05-13	Tyrion man I know you're upset but most of these spectators don't even have names. They ain't do shit to you man


They laughed at him.
1346	Gran de Lys	2014-05-13	Â 
Â 
I think what happened was Shae was gonna leave, but Tywin ordered all ships to be seized afterJoff's death, and then Shae gets found.Â 
Â 
Here is my theory, with less big-ticket unseen backstory, more King's Landingish treachery, and preserves the show's stupid whitewashing of Shae:
Â 
Bronn delivers the goods to Shae and tells her she should GTFO, courtesy Tyrion Lannister. What she thinks of this doesn't matter, although probably shocked/appalled/etc., considering how she acted (unreasonably, petulantly and unlikeably and with a bad accent) the last time she even thought he tried to buy her off, although by this time Tyrion has at least breached the notion.
Â 
Bronn promptly runs to Tywin (unlikely but quick-acting) or one of Cersei's little birds (much more likely but one degree of separation) to report that Tyrion still has a whore and she accepted a bag o' dragons to make like a tree and leave. Ambitious Bronn is seen as being useful to Top Lion Tywin, who seizes the hooker with the bag of gold and sees a brilliant closer for his show trial. Bronn knows Tyrion's value in KL is dropping fast, even before Joffrey's murder, and makes his move.
Â 
Well, I like it, anyway.
Â 
Oh, p.s. Looked for Bronn at the trial and could not find him, although his presence may not have been necessary. Still, it was weird.

1348	boojam	2014-05-13	Watching again.(1) The whole sequence from the IB conference room to Salladhor Saan is just a gem!What fine actors.(2)The Yara/Asha side story. When she's giving the pep talk on the ship, what the hell happened to about 30 of the other Ironborn? Maybe she picked a rading party? , but season 3 there DID seem to be 50 really ornery Ironborn bad asses.Why are there only five Ironborn heavies with Asha? How come she looses even two of them? Ramsay seems to lose all his men!All things being even, Asha should have just killed Ramsay just for the hell of it?Actually the way the scene cuts away she really does not seem concerned by the dogs.I can see that D&D wanted to reinterpret Asha as less glam but hard bitten salty sea-bitch as Yara (George may have wanted them to change the name?) So be it, I am liking Gemma Whelan in this role. (Gemma , herself, is no glamor queen, but in real life attractive... sure have made her a hard as nails looking.)(3) At the small council meeting , odd thing. Varys knows about the Hound's dust up at the inn, but says nothing, but nothing about Arya? No, his 'birds' would have known who she was.Curious.Strangely Tywin , sort of dismisses the dragons, while at Harrenhal tells Arya Dragons are WMDs.If they ever become War Dragons Westeros is toast.What did he write on that paper Mace fetched?

The child wasn't roasted, it was only the goat. Otherwise Dany would have freaked the hell out. I hope they add that eventually though.


Â 
In the book, she was having to pay every shepherd for their sheep and goats because she paid the first guy, so this decision should set up for more trouble down the line for Dany.Â  The child's bones didn't happen til later.
1353	Janicia	2014-05-13	Â 
So the Hound being spotted slaughtering some King's knights is noted by Varys, but not the fact that a girl around the age and with the looks of Arya (body never found) is with him and participated? Â Reference here is mostly the TV version and Varys' intel at the Council meeting.
Â 
Not being snarky, just saying. Â Whoever witnessed the Hound saying "Fluck the King" surely reported the girl with him. Â Why would the Hound be travelling with a random girl?
Â 
So I think Varys knows.
Â 
And yes, the books never explain how stupid the nobles of the Vale are. re: Sansa/Alayne.


Â 
Varys probably picked up on Sandor's affinity for Sansa. Â If Varys heard that Sandor was traveling with a young girl, it would make sense to assume that Sandor had come across another girl, felt some affinity, and now they they were traveling together. Â In the ravaged lands, there are lots of young girls in need of protectors, and a percentage of them would have a personality or appearance interesting to Sandor. Â Further, Sandor was kind of creepy with Sansa - the idea that he might pick up a young sexual object is also entirely plausible. Â The Mountain's men were very confused about why Sandor had deserted and what he was up to, but they didn't think it was weird at all for him to have a young female companion. Â People don't expect Sandor to serve as escort for noble ladies.
Â 
As for Sansa, I thought Littlefinger's plan was to keep quiet and maintain plausible deniability until Kings Landing lost interest in Sansa or collapsed and Tyrion was dead, and then unveil her. Â Didn't he mention toward the end of the book that he wanted rumors to start up about Sansa being in the Vale? Â Whether he wants to marry her or use her political status, he needs her to be Sansa and not his bastard daughter. Â Pretty sure he wants people to see through her flimsy disguise and convenient timing.
1354	Janicia	2014-05-13	No way did Olenna want Sansa caught in that way. Â She is clever, not mean to innocents. Â This is one of the mysteries of who did what with the poison and when. Â 
Â 


Margery thought that too. Â Olenna didn't spell out that she framed Sansa to Margery, but with the necklace evidence, Margery put it together. Â Olenna was willing for Sansa to be caught and executed. Â She probably didn't prefer it, but she was willing. Â 
Â 
Margery is fine with manipulation and lying, but I think she honestly didn't believer that her grandmother, who she loves and respects, Â would assassinate somebody and let two innocent decent people go down for it. Â Now Margery has to decide what she's willing to do and what she can live with. Â

Thanks, but I think you missed the part where that has anything to do with a coherent plan by Tyrion to foil his dad's plans.Â  That's just his dad's mercy, he doesn't recognize it's part of a strategy to get Jaime's compliance.
Â 
The fact that Tyrion has no plan is a big down-er from the book version where you get to see his intelligence and desperation on display both at once.

It's worth remembering that LF engineered the poisoning and Sansa's escape, guided the Tyrells to not only want Joffrey dead but Loras in the KG (in the books), and has been a Lannister-  Tyrell macher the whole time. I could see Olenna taking LF's word that Sansa would be safe enough for her conscience.
1358	hedgeknight001	2014-05-13	How would he know that, exactly?Â  The only other people who know Arya is even alive are Gendry, Hot Pie, and a few members of the Brotherhood.
The Hound abandons his post in spite and is seen traveling northward with a little girl -- and, ironically, Arya has never been accounted for.
Varys can connect dots. Or at least it would cause him to be suspicious.

1359	hedgeknight001	2014-05-13	Oh god, by that definition, everyone through history who doesn't share our values today was a cruel human being. It's ridiculous to make judgments like that without taking anything else into account.I've read "Beloved", by the way. I've read quite a few books about the horrors of slavery as well as segregation- I'm not saying it was okay. But I'm not going to say that everyone who ever owned a slave was a 'cruel and terrible' human being, because that's in no way true. Slavery has been used by every culture in the world at one point or another as an economic tool - it's no different in Essos.
Very well-stated.
Slavery (in reality, not GoT) has been practiced by nearly every pre- or non-Christian society, and a few Christian ones as well. Thousands of years of the institution in innumerable cultures did not produce a single "slave narrative." It didn't even do so in the US, where it was practiced for less than 200 years -- Kenneth Stampp's "The Peculiar Institution" and Eugene Genovese's "Roll Jordan Roll" are good studies of the diversity, if you will, of slavery just in the US.
Now try to apply the moral, legal, social, and economic aspects of slavery in reality to a fantasy world. I'm not sure what lessons one can derive from such an exercise, if there are any at all.

Â 
Possibly Olenna knew or suspected that Littlefinger wanted to spirit Sansa away, but it is equally possible that he didn't tell her about that part of the plan. Â He didn't need Olenna's cooperation to spirit Sansa away. Â But even if Olenna's plan was that Sansa would escape with Littlefinger, Olenna knows that she's putting Sansa in a really bad position totally at the mercy of a creep like Littlefinger. Â

iirc, LF wanted to reveal Sansa during the wedding to Harry, after Tyrion was dead(or declared dead)and the Lannister out of power.
about Varys picking up Sansan, it would have been hard too, since they were "close" out of side, in private, in public they were different.
1362	BlueDragon	2014-05-13	My point was that it actually wasn't at first. There were many white and black indentured servants in the new world. And I don't want to get into a debate about who the first slave owner was in what would become the United States, but at least one of the first legally recognized slave owners was a black man who sued and won indefinite custody of another black man, despite testimony from two white indentured servants that the black servant had fulfilled his agreement.


Â 
I know this, so why are you being so snarky about slavery? Â I know all this and more. Â

It is impossible to have a serious discussion on this blog about serious issues without the whole discussion descending into drivel and/or attack?

Â 
I get that, but slavery is a real issue in the show and many on this blog want to 'justify' all sorts of things that happen in this narrative with the line 'it was like that in the Middle Ages' (which I find dubious, at best, but no matter at present). Â 
Â 
And narrative exists to teach humans how to be human and what to do and what not to do. Â So what the show and book narrative teaches us couldn't be more important.
Â 
Also, lots of people want to condemn Dany for her mistakes while they redeem everyone from Jaime to the Hound to Stannis.
Â 
I think discussing all of this is relevant on the main threads.
1366	Stark11	2014-05-13	Speaking of Ironborn, why the hell have they not cast the Greyjoy uncles yet?

They probably won't until after this season, I think they are currently doing scouting locations right now, I would think for Dorne, Tyrions adventures, other spots in the North like Deepwood Motte, etc.  
I'm also 100% sure at least one of the uncles will be cast. Tyrion references one to Theon in season one. He just says "your uncle" though, talking about the 1st Greyjoy rebellion to him.

I get that, but slavery is a real issue in the show and many on this blog want to 'justify' all sorts of things that happen in this narrative with the line 'it was like that in the Middle Ages' (which I find dubious, at best, but no matter at present). Â 
Â 
And narrative exists to teach humans how to be human and what to do and what not to do. Â So what the show and book narrative teaches us couldn't be more important.
Â 
Also, lots of people want to condemn Dany for her mistakes while they redeem everyone from Jaime to the Hound to Stannis.
Â 
I think discussing all of this is relevant on the main threads.


Â 
I agree there isn't anything wrong with Â making a post in General ASOIAF as well. I'm only saying this particular thread is discussing the episode. Â
1368	HelenaExMachina	2014-05-13	I'm probably in the.minority but I thought this was a weak episode. Iron Bank scene was...well, flat and boring to me. Asha at the Dreadfort seemed pointless and acchieved next to nothing save showing the further deterioration or Reek, which could.have been done in another way. I suppose if its to set Asha up for.something else then fair enough but right now.it feels wasted. Maybe just because it was such a mystery and so hyped up, maybe not 
Meereen wasnt bad. Liked that Hizdhar looks like he is going to be more fleshed out than in the books. So are we not getting Hazzea till E10 or.something then?
Trial was the highlight, but couldnt make up for the rest of the episode imo
1369	Janicia	2014-05-13	iirc, LF wanted to reveal Sansa during the wedding to Harry, after Tyrion was dead(or declared dead)and the Lannister out of power.
about Varys picking up Sansan, it would have been hard too, since they were "close" out of side, in private, in public they were different.


Yeah, hard to know what Varys knows. Â But if Varys doesn't know that Sandor had a thing for Sansa, he certainly would never think that Sandor might be wandering around with Arya. Â I'm just saying that even somebody who knew that Sandor liked Sansa would think Sandor had just found some random girl (possibly one that reminded him of Sansa) rather than think "oh gosh, he must have found that kid that most likely died a year ago and hates him". Â Also, the innkeeper and his daughter probably heard Sandor's claim to be sleeping with Arya, which entirely eliminates the mystery of her presence. Â
1370	Daenor	2014-05-13	I don't think that anyone ever found that Sandor had a soft spot for Sansa.It's not as if the Hound would talk for such a matter to anyone.Actually i don't believe that anyone would have thought Sandor having a soft spot for anything except from killing.Therefore drawing conclusions or suspecting that he's escorting Sansa is not very possible.
1371	Gran de Lys	2014-05-13	That's a good point about Arya and the Hound being so visible. I just got carried along by their awesome road trip but now that I think about it, I can see both sides (it's so obvious! vs. who would know or care?). Surprising Tywin did not put a bow in this loose thread and send out an envoy--"I'm looking for a highborn girl of 10, potty-mouthed rapscallion, horse-faced, likes to stab things."
1372	The Lizard King	2014-05-13	I'm probably in the.minority but I thought this was a weak episode. Iron Bank scene was...well, flat and boring to me. Asha at the Dreadfort seemed pointless and acchieved next to nothing save showing the further deterioration or Reek, which could.have been done in another way.

Â 
Disagree here. Â Davos' speech to actually win some coin from the bankers was damn good.

Disagree here. Â Davos' speech to actually win some coin from the bankers was damn good.


Â Yes, the scene was a huge set-up for Davos to win back Stannis' trust. Â Stannis now knows not to kill/indungeonate (I think I made that up) Davos, and trust him to go forth and do what we all expect Davos to do.

Â 
I'm not commenting on the actress, she's a total milf (assuming she's had kids). It's the zombie+facial scars aspect. But then again all the facial scars from the books see to clean up quickly in the showÂ
1375	boojam	2014-05-13	Further, Sandor was kind of creepy with Sansa - the idea that he might pick up a young sexual object is also entirely plausible. Â The Mountain's men were very confused about why Sandor had deserted and what he was up to, but they didn't think it was weird at all for him to have a young female companion. Â People don't expect Sandor to serve as escort for noble ladiesBut Sandor sure as hell would pick up a ransom-able young girl, and just who might be wandering the country side unaccounted for?Varys was keeping that secret to himself.

1376	Gran de Lys	2014-05-13	That's what I'm thinking, boojam. SOMEBODY in Westeros has got to know Arya is alive and out there. I just can't remember how that plays into the fAyra plot later. Or perhaps it doesn't. It gets kinda blurry as of book 5.
1377	Fool of a Book	2014-05-13	Yes, to several above... there is no way Varys got reports about the Hound without reports about the girl with him.
Â 
And backing up, there is no way that Varys' little birds didn't take note of the entourage that left KL with Yoren....and there is no way Varys didn't know about the pursuit of Gendry/death of Yoren/fate or the rest of the entourage.
Â 
And backing up, there is no way that Varys' little birds didn't scope out Arya in the crowd at the Sept of Baelor, and even before that, wandering aound Flea Bottom.

1380	Fool of a Book	2014-05-13	Â

Â 
Varys knows about the girl travelling with the Hound, and he isn't an idiot. Â And he is certainly omnipresent with his little birds regarding what happens in KL.

PS Littlefinger likely knows as well.
1381	Xyzzy	2014-05-13	Â

Agreed. Even if they were, I'm not sure that they would know that the kid with the Hound is Arya. Just that he has someone tagging along with him. Polliver didn't recognize her until she said that she would pick her teeth with Needle. Whats one more ragged little kid out of all the thousands displaced by the fighting?
1382	Jackie Coogan	2014-05-13	The Trail (especial TyrionÂ´s final speach) and the Reek bath scene where awesome... the rest of the episode was ok...Â

In the books and show, Berric Dondarrion and crew knew she was alive and looking to go to Riverrun (before the Red Wedding).
Â 
In AFFC, Brienne hears rumors that The Hound was with a high-born girl (whom she assumes is Sansa) when she is looking at the Saltpans. Â Septon Merribald specifically corrects Brienne and says that the Hound had Arya, not Sansa (he helps the smallfolk that help Dondarrion).
1384	Chloe.a.thomson	2014-05-14	Â 
OK, that too. But shirtlessness is so common and expected on GoT that I no longer even notice it 
Â 
Â 
It's possible, of course, but why include something that would be so completely lost on show viewers who haven't read the books? He might have been thinking of Cersei and Jaime, Lysa and Littlefinger, even Shae and Tyrion (show-wise).


Â 
I just thought the look on Oberyn's face hinted at that... But I could be reaching. Every time Oberyn is onscreen, I am waiting for someone to mention Elia.
Â 
Â 
Â 
And although i have never thought about it, I agree with those that think that Varys is aware of Sansa's whereabouts and is keeping it quiet for now (in show and books). Keeping her undetected in the Vale means she can be of use to him in the future (he just has to deal with LF), however if she is captured and executed by the Lannisters, the North is lost to the Boltons (as far as Varys is concerned- assuming he doesn't know about Bran and Rickon).
1385	Daenor	2014-05-14	Varys has been using an extended network of spies indeed.But this doesn't mean that he knows everything.How the hell the wretched kids of Flea Bottom that are part of his "little birds" where supposed to recognize Arya for example?Or any other of his spies and informants?It's not as if Arya has some unique features that make her immediately recognizable and they can't exactly google her name,check her facebook or instagram to get some pictures of her.
1386	cronnyberg	2014-05-14	Tywin going to rat Jorah out?


didn't think about that untill you said it, but it makes perfect sense... what better way to disrupt a young girl with two advisors!
1387	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-05-14	Great episode. 
Theon/Ramsey bath scene was utterly horrific. Great acting by both, especially Alfie Allen. The sexual undertones were really uncomfortable... Especially the way Ramsey smiles at Theons ken doll patch. 
I never picked up on a sexual interest Ramsey had in Theon in the books but others did and it seems like D and D did as well. 
Tyrion was amazing. The whole trial was brilliant. 
Oberyn owns every scene he is in. 
I'm not so sure about Mace Tyrels portrayal. He seems extremely incompetent and I never got that impression from the books. He's an oaf. A bit of a buffoon. But he's not any bodies lap dog. I'm not bothered so much though. Different canon. 
I cannot wait to see The Mountain.
1388	Lady Blue Rose	2014-05-14	The weirdest bit was Sansa's necklace. We saw Littlefinger crush Sansa's necklace, so how the hell did Pycell get it or one that looked exactly like it? In that Rolling Stone interview with GRRM there was this:
Â 
That killing happens early in this fourth season. The books, of course, are well past the poisoning of King Joffrey.Â In the books â<U+0080><U+0093> andÂ I make no promises, because I have two more books to write, and I may have more surprises to reveal â<U+0080><U+0093> the conclusion that the careful reader draws is that Joffrey was killed by the Queen of Thorns, using poison from Sansa's hairnet, so that if anyone did think it was poison, then Sansa would be blamed for it. Sansa had certainly good reason for it.
Â 
Doesn't it sound like GRRM is hinting there's more to Joffrey's poisoning than we suspect? Last week when Cersei asked Margaery if she still wanted to be Queen I thought, what the fuck? Wouldn't it be a real pisser if Cersei was in on the poisoning? It's a crazy idea I know, but Tyrion says, "if there's one person I'm sure of that didn't kill Joffrey it's Cersei." That's just too good of a line to not be true. Oh the irony! Think about it. Cersei was losing control of Joffrey, and there's also this from the Rolling Stones interview:
Â 
I don't know if somebody like Jaime or Cersei can be redeemed. Cersei's a great character â<U+0080><U+0093> she's like Lady Macbeth.Â Well, redeemed in whose eyes? She'll never be redeemed in the eyes of some. She's a character who's very protective of her children. You can argue, well,Â does she genuinely love her children,Â or does she just love them because they're herÂ children? There's certainly a great level of narcissism in Cersei.
Â 
I would argue that Cersei viewed Joffrey as "hers", and when he wasn't "hers" anymore, she wanted him dead. 


Â 
I don't know about Cersei killing Joffrey. I think he was the only one of her children she genuinely loved unconditionally (not that she doesn't love the others but she does so in a twisted way). She was always tender and proud of him, even if he was a monster but with Tommen, she is constantly disappointed.
Â 
But, I have always wondered whether she would have issues and try to fight in some way when Tommen comes of age and tries to take power. I've believed that is a possibility ever since that scene when Tommen wants to make some sort of decision because he is the king and she punishes him. Her thoughts are that Tommen can wait for his turn at ruling because, after everything she had take from Robert, her father, etc., it was her turn now.
Â 
It is disturbing that she would think she has earned this and it is her time, given that it is Tommen who is actually king, she has no claim to the position except as his Mother. The dynamic of power between her and Tommen is significantly different than it was with Joffrey, granted Tommen is younger- but still, it make me think Cersei may later have issues ceding power to Tommen. â<U+0080>¦Once she gets out of the trials.Â
1389	Maia	2014-05-14	In the books and show, Berric Dondarrion and crew knew she was alive and looking to go to Riverrun (before the Red Wedding)..Â 
Because one of the BwB was a former Stark guardsman Harwin who knew her quite well. IIRC Arya also revealed herself to him immediately, thinking that she finally found somebody who was unreservedly on her side.
In AFFC, Brienne hears rumors that The Hound was with a high-born girl (whom she assumes is Sansa) when she is looking at the Saltpans. .Â 
Rumors coming from the same source - the BwB, who knew very well that Sandor stole Arya from them.
So, yea, the mere knews that Sandor was travelling with some ragged girl wouldn't have had anybody thinking of Arya.
They did some odd stuff in season 2, where it looked as if Littlefinger recognized Arya when visiting Tywin in Harrenhal, but there was no follow-up on his part whatsoever, so it seems like itwas just a quick way to ratchet tension a little.
If Varys had known Arya's whereabouts, he would have grabbed her for future use, or tried to.

1390	Mithras	2014-05-14	The TV show has its own canon but in the books, there is a very interesting theory that Cersei tried to poison Tyrion with the pigeon pie but Joffrey came and ate it. So, Joffrey died before the Tyrell plot was played.
1391	boojam	2014-05-14	The TV show has its own canon but in the books, there is a very interesting theory that Cersei tried to poison Tyrion with the pigeon pie but Joffrey came and ate it. So, Joffrey died before the Tyrell plot was played.Then what would all of Sansa's dealings with Ser Dontos and LF been about?
1392	Lady Blue Rose	2014-05-14	And I say there is no reason that Varys would not get a full report, and no reaons that Varys would not speculate who the girl with the Hound was.
Â 
We can disagree, that's cool.
Â 
PS Westeros is way bigger than Latin America! Â GRRM says it's roughly the length of South America.


Â 
I don't know if anyone already pointed this out, but I'm sure you meant that Westeros is SMALLER.
Â 
Latin American comprises all countries in the Americas were Roman languages (derived from Latin) are principle. It includes countries starting in North America and every country from Central and South America (start at Mexico and move all the way down to Brazil), as well as most islands on the Caribbean and some in the Pacific.Â 
Â 
South America is comprised by those countries South of Panama (starting with Colombia) all the way to Brazil. It is a bit over 3 million km2 smaller than Latin America.
Â 
Not saying this to give a Geo lesson, just so you get a better grasp of the actual size of Westeros. Â
1393	Mithras	2014-05-14	Then what would all of Sansa's dealings with Ser Dontos and LF been about?


Â 
It is here.
1394	Ghost wind	2014-05-14	Best episode so far! Surely of the season and probably of the whole series. I mean when Tyrion demanded the trial by combat I saw it was 49 minutes already and I was like wow that went quickly!
Â 
Loved Bravoos in the opening and the Titan but I pictured Bravoos more like foggy!
Â 
Then that Yara/Dreadfort thing. It took her long enough to get there didn't it? And correct me if I'm wrong but, is there sea near the Dreafort? From the credits I think not! Anyway good filler: it gives some screen time to Yara, it pictures how badly changed Theon is already which is good because we don't get his POVs and it shows how mad Ramsay is, I mean, going to battle without any shirt and with this cuts all over his chest! My only doubt is: was that the girl or the actual fight?? haha
Â 
I liked how Daenerys was handling the audiences and all but my only complain was Hizdahr. I mean why is he asking for his father? If you make him look like a nice guy who has nice feelings for his father, then it will not have the same effect when she marries him. In the books he seemed to me a total asshole who only cared for money and power. In the episode he was almost begging for his poor father who had not done anything to be buried... Nonsense!Â 
Also I think everyone saying how whitewashed Dany was didn't have much excuse this episode. They clearly showed how she had punished some innocent men and how she didn't liked it but anyway did it.
Â 
Liked very much the small council meeting! Oberyn makes up for Littlefinger and Mace is such a bootlicker!Â 
Â 
The whole trial was perfect I think. We can see how well Cersei has manipulated the witnesses so that every little thing Tyrion had done was tergiversated. Also it was clear how wounded he was when Varys confessed. I admire your good intentions Jaime but I think the little combat bit ruined your little plan! Oooh and the Shae! I mean, the look in Tyrion's face when he saw her!! And then how everything she said was just a lie with some bit of truth and how Tyrion just completely looses his head and starts shouting! That was greatly done! And of course the "I demand trial by combat".Â 
Â 
So very very good episode, enjoyed every bit
1395	Ghost wind	2014-05-14	I wish they had thought of introducing the names of some Ironborns. I mean, in the books they had such cool names and you could see how The captains and the kings fitted them. Everyone had their nickname and they really looked impressive.Â
1396	BlazeA50	2014-05-14	I think it was a wrong move to let Yara see Theon already. It would've been so much better to save it for later like in the books. Also, I somehow miss Theon, haha, because I thought the actor played Theon really well. But yeah, he is doing an amazing job as Reek too. Now that I am watching this after reading it, I really want Martin to eventually let Theon kill Ramsey, there is no way around it!!Â 
Â 
Anyway, the episode was GREAT but the Braavos scene... TOP NOTCH. Can't wait for the battle!
1397	madprofessah	2014-05-14	In the books there is so much chaos on the country side that , as George paints it, and I don't remember them running into any high born, so it is not surprising that Arya goes unnoticed.
Well actually , you know, Arya has only three chapters in Feast and only 2(!) in Dance.
(I am not counting Mercy yet.)
Those 5 chapters were my favorites in novels 4 and 5.
They are not short, but I was intrigued every moment, everything seemed off center, and Arya was growing and changing.
The show could do well with Arya's Braavos stuff.


Â Hear, hear! For me, as well, by far the best parts of Book 4 and Book 5 were the *sob* few Arya chapters, especially as Dany's went rapidly downhill and Tyrion's meandered.
Â 
As for the episode itself, I agree with everyone who said that the Dreadfort scene was ridiculous. Ramsay is in a swordfightÂ shirtless and doesn't get a scratch on him? (He has scratches from the rough sex with Myranda beforehand, methinks.) Ridonculously bad. Then it just turns into farce when the Iron Born run away from dogs! Sheesh.
Â 
But Peter Dinklage tore up the scenery in the trial scene, I'm still rooting for Charles Dance to get an Emmy. I don't think he has had a bad scene in the show, EVER. The look on Jaime's face when Tywin says quickly "Done!" is PRICELESS.
Â
1398	flores	2014-05-15	late to the party, but just had to say how much I loved the trial. Pycelle was giving me life with his "noble child" line!! Also the sheer bitchy SASS in meryn trant's eyes when he walked pass Tyrion was hilarious. So. good.
1399	KeeperOfOaths	2014-05-15	Brilliant episode. Highlights for me, Oberyn and Nikolaj. All their scenes, basically. And Tywin, I can't manage to really hate him. Charles Dance is so great.
1400	KeeperOfOaths	2014-05-15	Â 
Here is my theory, with less big-ticket unseen backstory, more King's Landingish treachery, and preserves the show's stupid whitewashing of Shae:
Â 
Bronn delivers the goods to Shae and tells her she should GTFO, courtesy Tyrion Lannister. What she thinks of this doesn't matter, although probably shocked/appalled/etc., considering how she acted (unreasonably, petulantly and unlikeably and with a bad accent) the last time she even thought he tried to buy her off, although by this time Tyrion has at least breached the notion.
Â 
Bronn promptly runs to Tywin (unlikely but quick-acting) or one of Cersei's little birds (much more likely but one degree of separation) to report that Tyrion still has a whore and she accepted a bag o' dragons to make like a tree and leave. Ambitious Bronn is seen as being useful to Top Lion Tywin, who seizes the hooker with the bag of gold and sees a brilliant closer for his show trial. Bronn knows Tyrion's value in KL is dropping fast, even before Joffrey's murder, and makes his move.
Â 
Well, I like it, anyway.
Â 
Oh, p.s. Looked for Bronn at the trial and could not find him, although his presence may not have been necessary. Still, it was weird. If this was true, Bronn would not be able to go with Jaime to the Riverlands. And I am pretty sure that Bronn will gonwith Jaime. They have to give Bronn something to do in season 5. Plus Jaime and Bronn are great together.

I don't think Alfie's going down the Christian Bale path anytime soon, though I'm not certain Reek should have such huge biceps. Someone should tell him to ease up on the weights...

Varys knows about the girl travelling with the Hound, and he isn't an idiot. Â And he is certainly omnipresent with his little birds regarding what happens in KL.
Â 
PS Littlefinger likely knows as well.

I doubt anyone knows except the crow that has followed them. Really there is absolutely no evidence anyone knows and many think it's a boy. Only Elder Brother, Hound, Arya, and BWB know and they aren't telling, for obvious reasons. If someone knew they'd be after her. Viz - one guy knows about Rickon. Sudden manhunt. (Books)
At least one person might know about Sansa. Or will soon.
1407	7th-key	2014-05-16	I don't think Alfie's going down the Christian Bale path anytime soon, though I'm not certain Reek should have such huge biceps. Someone should tell him to ease up on the weights...


Â 
I'd find it exaggerated for an actor to go through negative physical changes for a TV show - especially when the show doesn't even bother to highlight the Lannister's hair...
Â 
My understanding is that with movies there's a lot more money involved, not just for the actor to make their loss worth it; the whole production has a gain if a famous name actor takes a certain part rather than a no-name with more appropriate physique.Â

1411	Tomislav	2014-05-17	Hello, first post, be gentle with me...
I've not read the books (yet), so my ignorance of them must be taken into account.
I wanted to offer a few observations and ideas about the Yara Flees From Dogs scene.
First, this is a classic Ramsay trope, setting his hounds on a woman, even down to giving her a head start. Presumably he doesn't need the hounds to win, as Yara and co. are probably heavily outnumbered, but he just can't resist.
Secondly, even before the Mr. Burns moment, Yara is already negotiating, offering Theon's release as a price for leaving without further deaths. Given that she is Iron Born, accustomed to "paying the iron price", she is already calculating that she will lose a straight up fight here. Otherwise she would still be fighting and just take Theon by force. This calculation is supported by the whole stealth mode of the raid.
So, in her position it looks like 1. she will lose a fight if she stays. 2. Theon/Reek is far enough gone as to no longer be her brother, even if she wins (and she knows that she will not win, cannot emphasise that enough).
So she can die for nothing, and have more men die for nothing, or leave.
The fact that their current foe will likely flay torture and dismember them rather than just kill may also colour the choices somewhat.
Thus far the logic of her actions is impeccable.
It's not that she is running from the dogs, per se. They do make an already un-winnable fight even more one sided, but Ramsay'sÂ fondness for hunting fleeing women with dogsÂ gives her a shot at escaping, and she takes it.Â 
Â 
Where I do feel it's a bit odd is to not even try to kill Ramsay with an axe throw, just for revenge.
Granted we've already seen he's probably capable enough a fighter to evade or parry such an attempt, and maybe she reasons if he is sadist enough to give them a head start she will take advantage of that and use it to escape.
I'll have to re-watch to see if I'm reading the scene correctly.
Â 
As others have pointed out, the show! writers were painted into a bit of a corner with her mission which could neither rescue Theon nor result in Yara or Ramsay getting killed, and I think given the constraints of sharing an episode with The Trial the writer did reasonably well to exposit that she tried, saw Theon's transformation/Stockholm Syndrome/brainwashing, and decided to write him off.
Â 
Not the greatest scene in the whole thing, but it got us fromÂ A to B while staying reasonably true to what we know of the characters and culture at this point.

I would've loved seeing Yara throw her axe. I know she can't kill Ramsay, but maybe she could have thrown it at one of his guards?

Thank you. Â Duly noted.

I'd find it exaggerated for an actor to go through negative physical changes for a TV show - especially when the show doesn't even bother to highlight the Lannister's hair...
Â 
My understanding is that with movies there's a lot more money involved, not just for the actor to make their loss worth it; the whole production has a gain if a famous name actor takes a certain part rather than a no-name with more appropriate physique.Â 

See The Normal Heart.
1416	boojam	2014-05-18	Not much of anywhere else to put this, but they must be really trying to make up to Julian Glover for last season!He has had as much on screen time as the first season, well almost.

Â 
The people I watched that episode with were screaming, "He's not wearing any armor! Â Throw something at him!!" Â It was kind of amusing actually.
1418	boojam	2014-05-18	I would've loved seeing Yara throw her axe. I know she can't kill Ramsay, but maybe she could have thrown it at one of his guards?We see her kill 4 guys with her axe.Two of them during the Dog Cage Room fight.But I think that scene was re-edited before airing.Yet as far as I can tell she and the Iron Born left, 3 I think, could have killed all the dogs and Ramsay too.
1419	VladimirDulud	2014-05-18	Does anyone else kind of have problems with the fact that they turned Mace, the man who successfully laid siege to the second most powerful house in Westeros, into a fat moron?Â 


Â 
I second this.Â
1420	About the Other Knight	2014-05-18	I thought Ramsay had no formal weapons training other than Reek. How could he have gotten an upper hand on a handpicked elite ironborn raiding party? The iron born are as twisted as Ramsay, so i dont see his natural viscousness giving him an advantage either.Â
1421	A True Kaniggit	2014-05-18	Anyone else irritated by the fact that Stannis, who is supposed to be bankrupt, sail into Braavos with a ship sporting custom made Flaming Heart Crowned Stag sails?
1422	boojam	2014-05-18	Anyone else irritated by the fact that Stannis, who is supposed to be bankrupt, sail into Braavos with a ship sporting custom made Flaming Heart Crowned Stag sails?Well even the show implies Stannis did have a rear guard and modest resources left after Blackwater.In fact I don't think it's mentioned in the book how many ships he got away with, I guess since Salladhor and his 30 or so ships , which did not sail into Blackwater, helped out?So that he would have at least one good ship is plausible.............................................................In the book , I knew Stannis was his way, but between this decision to got to the Wall and his arrival at Castle Black, ta da!... as far as I remember, George does not tell us where he got the reinforcements in ships and men, it's still a total mystery to me. Between Storm of Swords Davos VI and Jon X when Stannis rides to the rescue we find out nothing about how Stannis recovered from the huge losses at Blackwater. I don't even remember Salladhor being hired as an ally.David and Dan have at least solved that problem, hiring ships is one thing, with most of your vassals dead how the hell does he augment his 4000 troops? We know they did not not hire the Golden Company. Other sell swords? Maybe we will find out.
1423	HelenaExMachina	2014-05-19	Stannis recieves no reinforcements or extra ships in the books. Salladhor Saan doesn't abandon him until after the Battle at Castle.Black, and Stannis takes only around 1500 North with him, transported by Salla, the majority of men remaining to him after the Blackwater. He leaves small garrisons to hold Dragonstone and Storm's End.
1424	Maryann Clifford	2014-05-12	A lot of houses have animals as their sigils (dire wolf, dragons, lions) 
Also danaerys has her dragons, jon has ghost, bran has summer...
If you could have an animal sigil for your family what would it be !? Also any suggestion for the other houses and what animal you could maybe see Margery tyrell or maybe Roose Bolton having as a companion ?
1425	High-born Plumber	2014-05-12	Tyells could be a fox. 
Boltons would be a snake in the grass...
1426	Kingpin	2014-05-12	Personally, I'd like a Phoenix as a sigil.Â 
Â 
For Tyrells a cow or a goat would be appropriate, that's what comes to my mind when I think of their country. A ram or bull, to be tougher.Â 
Â 
For Boltons some sort of insect or lizard, cockroach maybe.Â 
Â 
I can see Margaery having a cat, and Roose a komodo dragon.Â
1427	The Lady Leela	2014-05-12	Margaery should have a hawk named Longthorn.
1428	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-05-12	I would make my sigil a Portuguese Man O' War.
Â  House Myre could be a maroon bellied conure.
Â
1429	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-05-12	Tyells could be a fox.


Â 
Yep, the Florent sigil would fit them a lot (and I like it more than their rose)
Â 
For the Boltons...Oh, I got it! A leech!
Â 
I'm not a big fan of the Martell sun and spear. I'd rather they have a scorpion. Small but deadly, much like Dorne
1430	Maryann Clifford	2014-05-13	I like that Margery would have a cat ! Kinda fits her character! 
And can anyone think of something for little finger !
1431	Domonju	2014-05-13	Chameleon for Littlefinger.
1432	NOT A TARG I SWEAR	2014-05-13	Podrick Payne's would be a Stallion for many reasons.
1433	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-05-13	House H'ghar would be a chameleon
1434	Dolorous Nick	2014-05-13	House Frey would be a weasel.  House Manderley would be a walrus.  House Slynt would be a dung beetle...with all apologies to the dung beetle.  Since Tommen is King and can do as he damn well pleases, I would love to see him choose a kitten for the royal sigil.
1435	direwoofwoof	2014-05-13	Â Since Tommen is King and can do as he damn well pleases, I would love to see him choose a kitten for the royal sigil.


Â 
A Ser Pounce sigil!!
Â 
I can't recall what the Reed sigil is but it could be a frog.
1436	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-13	I'd like a little black cat for mine.Â
1437	ipsuel	2014-05-13	Mine would be a tiger or jaguar of some sort (like the blue tiger).
Â 
ForÂ Margaery -- theÂ Margay (a small, very dangerous feline).
For Sandor, a phoenix.Â Â Â :-)Â
1438	Kirijax	2014-05-13	An eagle would be cool. Of the houses in GOT, Baratheon's is the coolest and the one I would choose.Â
1439	The Lizard King	2014-05-13	A vicious, snarling platypus. Â  
Â
1440	TallTyrionLannister	2014-05-13	House Bolton already has the animal that best represents their house. The flayed man himself, Theon "Reek" Greyjoy.
Â 
I wish we got to see House Reed stuff. I like the idea of floating castles and gators swimming about everywhere.
Â 
House Umber having their own giant army could be awesome, as well, or possessing that giant-summoning horn.
Â 
Â 
Stannis having a flaming Stag would be cool. Impractical and horrifying, but cool.
1441	Maryann Clifford	2014-05-14	I think I would pick a mammoth even though I'm not a giant !
1442	I'll pay the iron price	2014-05-14	A Wolverine would be awesome for obvious reasons
1443	Clariana	2014-05-14	A chihuahua, small but tough and untamed!
1444	Batbob45	2014-05-30	A three headed dog(like in Harry Potter) would be cool.
1445	Odon	2014-06-17	Book!Brienne is often compared to a horse, but TV!Brienne doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have the prominent teeth so her sigil should be a mule, for stubbornness.
Â 
House Clegane should be a half-eaten chicken and a bloody baby on a blackened field.
1446	REVEALnothing	2014-05-13	Am I the only one that found it kinda odd for Varys to tell the small council that the Hound has been seen, but he does not tell them that Arya is with him. If Varys knows what happenedÂ  in the bar down to the "fuck the king" line, wouldÂ he have known that Arya is with him? and if so why not tell?
Â 
Im still new enough to not know how to do the spoiler tag thing for now but this next part is kind of spoilery??
The question above led me to think of another.Â While reading the sample Mercy chapter I kept thinking the guy training Arya put me in the mind if Varys. Im not clear as to the timeline that far ahead at the moment, but I think by then Varys has fled KL and is where?? I know there are many many and more a theoryÂ  of Varys is a FM and the like but have never really been sure of them myself, but....makes me wonder.Â Â 
Â
1447	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-14	Oh, you know I never picked up on the fact it was odd for him to not mention Arya with the hound, but you're right! But even so...Tywin buts a price on the Hound's head, so if Varys cared about her life at all, he might have seemed a bit more bothered. Not sure how though.
1448	WTFSalami	2014-05-14	Why would Varys have any idea that that was Arya Stark? His little birds wouldn't know that it was Arya Stark, it's not like she injects her identity into every conversation that would be remarkably stupid. 
Sandor even says that she's his whore, and nobody in that inn would have cause to think otherwise. Everybody believes that Arya is dead.
1449	lostinasia	2014-05-14	It'd be very unlikely that anyone who reported that news would know it was Arya who was with the Hound. Maybe they'd mention a girl he was travelling with, but it'd be a major leap for anyone to guess it was a missing Stark girl.
Â 
That being said, Varys finds out some rather surprising information at times!
1450	Teren_Kanan	2014-05-14	Why would Varys have any idea that that was Arya Stark? His little birds wouldn't know that it was Arya Stark, it's not like she injects her identity into every conversation that would be remarkably stupid.

This. No one knows that that was Arya, nothing to report.
1451	acosta	2014-05-14	I thought he was giving the "fuck the king" line from when Tyrion ordered him back into battle and he chose to leave instead.
1452	Hodor's Dragon	2014-05-14	The Hound is recognizable across the realm. Â Arya Stark in filthy rags, not so much.
1453	Stannis' shadow babies	2014-05-14	I was going to ask the same thing. I wouldn't put it past Varys to be withholding information. Probably doesn't know it's Arya but the fact Sandor was travelling with a little girl (a little girl who also killed one of the king's men, so not so unworthy of mentioning) could make him curious to find out more? I don't see it as farfetched, to be honest.
1454	idler	2014-05-14	Arya has incredible plot armor. Show Tywin has seemingly forgotten that Ned Stark had two daughters, Cersei never mentions to her father that Arya Stark is missing and that she sent out Baelish to find her; Baelish himself doesn't even tell Sansa that he found her at Harrenhal, following ancient House Stark rule from the books...
(They said it together: "Don't...tell...Sansa!")
Â 
The BwB, The Hound and LF know that Arya is alive and well. If Varys really doesn't know, it's time for him to retire!
1455	Petyr Patter	2014-05-14	Arya has incredible plot armor.

(They said it together: "Don't...tell...Sansa!")
Â 
The BwB, The Hound and LF know that Arya is alive and well. If Varys really doesn't know, it's time for him to retire!


Â 
I suspect Baelish didn't realize the cupbearer was Arya.Â  Between a growth spurt, the hair cut, the fact Baelish never paid much attention to Arya compared to her sister, the servant clothes, and the sheer impossibility of one of the highest born woman in Westeros vanished from King's Landing and ended up serving wine to her family's enemy means Baelish didn't put it together.Â  Plus, he was there on a very high stakes mission, and was putting all his focus on Tywin Lannister.Â 
Â 
Or, look at it this way.Â  Even if Varys does know, the report is going to sound impossible.Â  How did Arya end up in the Riverlands?Â  How did the Hound capture her?Â  Varys is paid for reliable information, which means his information must sound reliable.Â  If nothing else, he would have to reveal his source, which Varys doesn't like to do.
1456	MidnightKiss	2014-05-14	Most people seeing Arya would still think she's a boy and that's the message Varys may have been sent.Â
1457	MaximumPatlickicus	2014-05-14	...think by then Varys has fled KL and is where??
Â 


has he? I always figured he was still in kings landing, hiding in the tunnels/behind walls. Though I suppose after killing Kevan and Pycelle,\ there isn't much reason for him to be in KL anymore. Maybe he's off to hook up with Aegon? or maybe he's still in KL awaiting the time to open the gates to let Aegon in... though, again, with his knowledge of secret passages, getting in and out of the city wouldn't be much of a challenge so I wouldn't think he'd have to stay inside to accomplish that anyway.
Â 
he could be anywhere, but I don't see him across the narrow sea because he's very much invested in getting Aegon on the throne.
1458	Adam de Felden	2014-05-14	I thought that the fuck the king reference was a reminder of clegane at the blackwater.
1459	Envie	2014-05-14	I was going to ask the same thing. I wouldn't put it past Varys to be withholding information.

I don't see it as farfetched, to be honest.


Â 
I'll jump on the side of this debate that thinks it's odd Varys knew such detail of Sandor's location and what he's been doing but makes no mention of a traveling companion with him who seems out of place whether it's a boy or a girl? Why would The Hound bother to have a kid along with him who may or may not appear as a prisoner? If he's got spies watching and reporting - they'd have mentioned that and even if Varys didn't know who it was it would seem like relevant information - especially since they're now heading straight for the Eyrie...
Â 
I too think they've given Arya some serious plot armor since no one seems to care or mention her in King's Landing anymore. I'm guessing they all do assume she's dead since she hasn't been seen since Ned Stark's death and that was a long time ago by tv show timeline. I think it's ok that no one's talking about her anymore but still - even not recognizing her with the Hound, it's a bit odd Varys did not mention her. He has to have known about a kid traveling with Sandor.
1460	boojam	2014-05-14	This whole thread is labeled with a 'spoiler' warning.Â Am I the only one that found it kinda odd for Varys to tell the small council that the Hound has been seen, but he does not tell them that Arya is with him. If Varys knows what happenedÂ  in the bar down to the "fuck the king" line, wouldÂ he have known that Arya is with him? and if so why not tell?From the get go there has been something mysterious going on about Varys. Namely the Illyrio-Varys 'conspiracy' , which is still very cloudy. We do get Illyrio involved in Tyrion's story. Varys arranges to smuggle him out of King's Landing and sends him to Illyrio in Pentos. Seems , as far as we know now, that Illyrio and seemingly by implication that the Illyrio-Varys 'conspiracy' has something do with helping the Targaryens (one true one we know and one who may or may not be a Targ)... why? We don't really know.Both Varys and Illyrion are Essosi , seeming with an interest in Westeros.Other Essosi may be in the plan with them... because it is exceedingly odd that a Faceless Man , Jaqen, another Essosi, succeeds in getting Arya to Braavos (Arya seemingly passing a test of travel, but actually doing it on her own).Seems 'the powers that be', with Big Plans' are being laid for Daenerys, Arya, Tyrion and Aegon Targaryen (still a murky figure, if he is Aegon!)So my best surmise is that Varys does not want the IT to know where Arya is , but does not mind speaking of the Hound... for what reason is also kind of mysterious.We are almost dead sure Varys knows , well that was even revealed , on the show last season, where Sansa is. Knowledge of this is withheld by Varys, interestingly, since it would damn Little Finger. So far in the books Varys has not used this ace.Now if he revealed that the Hound had a girl, somebody would put two and two together, who is missing among the Starks , who were at KL, besides Sansa, who would be a valuable ransom-able hostage? If the tavern brawl had been observed down to the detail of how many of the Kings men Sandor killed, and he had a girl with him who retrieves an elegant small sword and then uses it, hmmm...just who would that be?We were given indication that LF knows Arya is on the loose, but has kept his mouth shut about it, not sure why that is?Â Im still new enough to not know how to do the spoiler tag thing for now but this next part is kind of spoilery??The question above led me to think of another.Â While reading the sample Mercy chapter I kept thinking the guy training Arya put me in the mind if Varys.

1461	Banner Without Brothers	2014-05-14	The only two witnesses to the hound and Arya were the inn keep and his daughter. One of Varys' little birds got their information from them. Unless one of them was a little bird themselves. This is how I see the conversation going down.

Inn Keep: the kings men were going to rape my daughter and weren't going to pay for their food

Seven hells. In s1e04, Baelish had to explain his nickname "Littlefinger" to Arya with a dozen people in hearing range. At a distance of half a yard! Quite embarassing. He sure as hell identifies this strange female ("That will be all, girl!") cupbearer that splashes some wine over him in s2e06. In s3e01, he tells Sansa that he's met Arya. In s3e02, even The Hound who got never very near to her recognizes the bypassing Arya.
Â 
Of course LF identified her. And committed treason by not telling Tywin; after all, Cersei ordered him to find Arya! And he keeps talking to Tywin of Tyrion's proposal concerning Catelyn's daughters, as if Arya were still in King's Landing! He must be damn sure that Cersei and Tywin will never discuss the whereabouts of Arya Stark...
1464	idler	2014-05-15	Most people seeing Arya would still think she's a boy and that's the message Varys may have been sent.Â 


Hmmm... Polliver who in Harrenhal still took her for a boy had no problem identifying her as "a bit broken in little chicken".
The Hound taking out three of the King's men is business as usual, but a little girl killing two of them might be worth a message to King's Landing...
1465	boojam	2014-05-15	In s3e01, he tells Sansa that he's met Arya.Yeah it's weird , Aidan Gillen was asked , this year wasn't it?, on the NY Red Carpet, why LF didn't finger Arya at Harrenhal.He either hedged or honestly didn't remember his line from season 3!

Varys mentions dragons in the East very casual to Tyrion. No need to speak about a little girl. How should he draw the conclusion that there she Arya?

1469	boojam	2014-05-15	He did? Don't remember that scene. IMHO just another F-up of the show writers. Doesn't make any sense to me not revealing Arya to Tywin.Yeah just watched the scene again , it's at the sea front of KL, LF just flat tells Sansa he has seen her sister, oddly Sansa does not ask where.That LF would keep it a secret , for his own purposes, fit the character.That Varys would keep Aray's whereabouts a secret also fits the character.
1470	King Zee	2014-05-15	. In s3e01, he tells Sansa that he's met Arya.Â 


Â 
LF is lying to try and get Sansa's trust. Â  Its supposed to be a joke. LF is lying about meeting Arya when in fact he did see her and didnt recognize her.

Even Arya herself knows that LF will recognize her at once. Hence the horrified look on her face when Lord Petyr Baelish is announced. You can see that Tywin is irritated by Baelishs permanent interest for his cupbearer, but he may know that LF is going after little girls.

Arya thinks moss grows on the north side of trees and is responsible for her and Gendry getting lost in the Riverlands. Â Arya is Â simply wrong in this case.

Â 
This. Why would Varys not know or think it somewhat significant that in this same Inn where we presume he got the spy info from - this unnamed, unmentioned kid (doesn't matter whether boy or girl) kills two grown menÂ who are sworn to the crown and is in the company of the Hound?
Â 
Either they're just leaving these omissions as plot holes because it's irrelevant to the show's story line or they're purposely leaving out mention of her by Varys for another reason we do not know. I tend to think it was just lack of needing Arya in the storyline for King's Landing because she's leaving soon for Braavos.
1475	1000AcresAndAHoldfast	2014-05-15	As far as I know there is only a few people in Westeros at this point who even know Arya is still alive. Apart from the Brotherhood without Banners and Gendry, there is the possibility that Littlefinger recognized her serving on tywin lannister (I believe he did) but he is hardly likely to share that information with Varys who is one of his most serious competitors in the Game. Arya slipped through the net of even Varys and his little birds because she is quite similar to them really, she can hide in the shadows and take on different identities easily, because people always underestimate her. Even though this isn't elaborated on as much as the books where she already has about 5-6 aliases!Â

1476	Pod The Impaler	2014-05-15	Am I the only one that found it kinda odd for Varys to tell the small council that the Hound has been seen, but he does not tell them that Arya is with him. If Varys knows what happenedÂ  in the bar down to the "fuck the king" line, wouldÂ he have known that Arya is with him? and if so why not tell?


Â 
Â 
Â 


Â 
I'll jump on the side of this debate that thinks it's odd Varys knew such detail of Sandor's location and what he's been doing but makes no mention of a traveling companion with him who seems out of place whether it's a boy or a girl? Why would The Hound bother to have a kid along with him who may or may not appear as a prisoner?
Â

Â 
Â 
Varys would not know it was her if the witnesses did not know it was her.
Â 
What he would hear is "The Hound came into some inn with some peasant girl; a fight broke out between him and some of his brother's men, and 5 of his brother's men were killed. The conversation went something like "chickens... something something ... fuck the king."
Â 
If Varys has very good information, he may have heard that this girl may once have been one of the Brotherhood Without Banners. If varys' sources had heard the Hound had been captured by the BWB (which they might have), they may think that's where he got himself some girl who now travels with him. Or they may think the Hound has actually joined the BWB. In either case, if they know the girl killed 1 or 2 men in that fight, then her having BWB explains it better than it being Arya Stark.
Â 
Anyone could recognize the Hound - a huge man with a burned face and a bad temper. I figure one reason why the Hound was able to identify Arya when she was with the BWB was that they had been travelling together for months as Ned and his retinue journeyed to King's Landing. Littlefinger probably met her all of one time, and Tywin never. (Even Polliver didn't know it was Arya, just some insolent prisoner girl from Harrenhal.) Â 
Â 
Varys knew Arya escaped - he tells Ned in S1 that he knew she escaped but that he did not know where. There's only way I can think of that Varys would know Arya even escaped King's Landing: Varys was the one who arranged Gendry be given to Yoren of the Night's Watch, and if he watched them leave King's Landing, he might have seen Arya go with them. But that is speculation, as every actual thing he's said about her indicates he has no idea where she's gone or if she's even still alive. (And remember that people really were intensely looking for her.)

Â 
I never argued that they witnesses / spies would know it was Arya. My argument is that something would have been mentioned (one would think) if their job is to report unusual activity or if important persons from King's Landing are recognized such at the Hound who has been reported as a deserter from the king's immediate defense in Blackwater. I'm sure Varys has had spies tailing Sandor Clegane for quite awhile or at least looking for him. The scene at the Inn was pretty significant - a whole room full of Lannister / Crown supporters were killed and the Hound wad directly involved. It seems odd that his accomplice, would not be mentioned.
Â 
As for Varys knowing Arya escaped:
Â 
Varys knew Arya escaped the Red Keep, and that's what he told Ned Stark. He did not know for certain that she escaped King's Landing - or if he did, it was never said in the books that we know of or on the show.
Â 
I thought it was Ned Stark who arranged for Gendry to go with Yoren and the Night's Watch?Â 
Â 
Regardless, Yoren got ahold of Arya only because Ned Stark saw her standing on the statue of Balor at the last minute before his execution and yelled "Balor" to Yoren. Unless Varys and his spies saw that interaction or Yoren taking Arya (unlikely in the mob and confusion of the chaos at that moment) then there's not much chance she was seen leaving KL with Yoren and the Night's Watch recruits. Besides, the proof there is that when the King's Men came and confronted Yoren - they were looking for Gendry, not Arya despite her fear they were there for her. So Varys clearly didn't know Arya went with Yoren.

	Spoiler As we know future events, which I think will play out on the show, Varys seems to owe nothing to the crown. When he is instrumental to helping Tyrion escape and then disappears himself , shows he is being devious.
 So it is not in the least odd Varys would not mention Arya, Varys has his own agenda.Â As for Varys knowing Arya escaped:Â Varys knew Arya escaped the Red Keep, and that's what he told Ned Stark.

Besides, the proof there is that when the King's Men came and confronted Yoren - they were looking for Gendry, not Arya despite her fear they were there for her. So Varys clearly didn't know Arya went with Yoren.The 'royal decree' that went out to find Gendry was top most on those afraid of Robert's bastards (tho that was mean spirited since they lawfully posed no threat to the throne, but considering who did it...). So Arya was way down on the list at that time. In the books , I can't remember for sure, KL only takes note of her absence after some time, and then I don't think anyone was even sent looking for her, keep saying she was probably dead.Even in the books I never knew how Vary's 'little bird' network worked , in KL maybe , but out the realm it would really have to be the buying of information. What ever, if they could track Sandor they would have known it was Arya the inference was clear.I don't understand the idea that Varys is compelled to be truthful to the crown?(I don't think this scene is in the books, would think the crown would like to punish the Hound, but if he's wandering around , the hell with him.)

Â 
Â 
While reports from a battlefront are important, finding anyone specific wandering alone in a war zone - much less trailing them and engaging in continuous observation - would be exceedingly difficult.
For example, the Iron Throne did make quite a lot of effort to find Jaime Lannister after learning of his escape, but never actually found him. Roose Bolton's men found him first, but those were dedicated trackers, a well-armed group. Could just as easily have been Karstark men, or Robb's other men, or the BWB, or soldiers from the Lannuister side, or bandits. A "little bird" would not fare well roaming around asking questions when it's just a coin flip whether anyone you meet out there might try to kill you. Point is: Varys might be listening for reports of interest, but nobody's going to follow the Hound unless they mean to kill or capture him (as the BWB did). Now that he has heard, he may stand a better chance of tracking him from the inn, but the question remains who would seek after the Hound that does not also fear being killed by the Hound (or someone else) ? As such, the report would be from someone (like the innkeep) who is not likely to know who the girl was, only that she arrived with the Hound before all hell broke loose. Varys may indeed be holding back more information than he actually knows, but I do not think there would be much to withhold in the first place.
Â 
On the other matter, it was Ned who knew Gendry was of interest, but Varys had to be the one who arranged his sudden trip with Yoren. Nobody was killing Robert's bastards until after Ned had been captured, and Varys also knew who Gendry was.
1483	evita mgfs	2014-05-23	I will need to check my documents, but I am sure the theatre "motif" I have been documenting for the past two years definitely "connects" Arya and Varys.Â  As a matter of fact, I recall writwiing two separate compositions, one on Arya and another on Varys, and their narratives shared language relative to the performing arts.Â  If Martin intends to link Varys, Arya, mummery, and banking together, he has certainly already "set the stage" with foreshadowing.
Â 
Regardless, Martin cleverly insinuates other possibilities - so readers cannot feel confident in their understanding of Martin.Â  The tricksy author keeps his audience guessing - and that is his genius.
1484	Odon	2014-06-17	It's easy to think of a number of reasons why Petyr wouldn't tell anyone about Arya.
- He's pissed off at how Cersei had his guards put a knife to his throat and ordered him to find her.Â  We know how Petyr holds a grudge.
- He'd gain nothing except a grudging thanks from Lord Tywin if he turned her in then and there.Â  At the time LF was setting up the deal with the Tyrells which would earn him much greater rewards.Â  Why not hold onto the information until it was of value?Â  He may even have thought that Tywin already knew who his cupbearer was and is running his own Game.
- If captured, Arya might have been sent to Kings Landing to be held along with her sister.Â  It's in LF's interest to keep Sansa isolated so she'll look to Uncle Petyr for support.
Â 
As for Varys, I still think he just didn't know.Â  Remember that he's got to filter a vast amount of information, much of it second or third hand and unreliable (we see that in the books when he reports Renly's death).Â  And things were pretty confused in that fight, especially if you were running for your life and then keeping your head down until everyone had left.Â  I'm not surprised all the focus was on Sandor; I doubt the witnesses even saw Arya kill anyone as they fled upstairs long before she got into the affray.Â  Maybe they heard the "can you walk, boy" speech, but they wouldn't have understood it.Â  So all they knew is that Sandor walked into the inn with a little girl he was using as a whore, got into an argument with Lannister soldiers, committed an act of lA¨se-majestA©, brutally killed five men, stole a white horse and ate every fucking chicken in the room.Â  Varys never mentions the girl to the Council because it's an irrelevant detail (and no, "fuck the King" is not irrelevant to a kingdom that's still in rebellion, despite Lannister propaganda).

1485	rocksniffer	2014-05-11	Well boys and girls that was an interesting trial to finally see...I wonder if the rest of you found it as enjoyable as i did.
Â 
Let's break it down...
Â 
I thoroughly enjoyed the bit between Jamie and Tywin...I had often wondered about book-Kevin's visit to Tyrion and the promise that he could go to the wall...this little addition of Jamie promising to give Tywin his hearts desire, a true heir to the Rock, and then Jamie's words to Tyrion made up for the loss of Kevin. Though I am concerned about Kevin's future roll, as it was written...I am guessing he is another casualty of the show's time constraints.
Â 
I also enjoyed the bit about Varys and his not forgetting his words about saving the city...I get the feeling that he will do his bit to help Tyrion when the time comes...
Â 
all in all a good episode that stayed on point with the story...except for Stannis...and I for one am happy for this addition. It shows that Davos is the savior of Stannis and his ability to perhaps...go North...
Â 
...of course these are just the musings of this salty old asshole...
Â 
...what say the rest of you... Â  
Â 
eta: for the spelling gestapo...Â

1486	Obebb	2014-05-11	I really liked the trial. They did a very good job. I particularly liked how with Shae it was hard to tell if she really was just a lying whore the whole time or if she was being forced to say everything, because that was the same feeling I got when reading that part in the books. Or at least, I've always thought it was meant to seem that way.

Â 
when i first read the books i thought that as well right up until the moment Tryion finds her at the crucial moment...after that i felt no sympathy for her...she was just trying to improve her station since Tyrion was trying to be loyal to Sansa...after the moment in the show where he refused her she might have been loyal, after that...all bets were off
1488	Newstar	2014-05-11	It was interesting how the bit with TV Shae was left ambiguous. She did seem genuinely nervous. Was she coerced? Did she act out of mercenary concerns? Out of spite? Was her testimony bought, or forced? Was she just putting on a good show of being scared, to make her story more convincing? As with the PW and with the RW on the show, we might get explanations after the fact making it very clear what TV Shae's deal was, why she did what she did, and who if anyone was behind her testimony.
Â 
I did like Jaime trying to make a deal to save Tyrion's life (and Tywin smugly quaffing his wine afterwards as Jaime had no doubt played right into his hands). PD's being praised for the episode and rightly so, but NCW was fantastic.
Â 
Another interesting change from the books is that Sansa's guilt seemed a lot more stark (no pun intended) in the show than in the books. I have no doubt that Littlefinger intended the necklace and Dontos' body to be discovered, to cement Sansa's guilt. I wonder if that will be important in the books down the road. It seems to be taken for granted in the fandom that the still-standing charges against Sansa will cease to be an issue once Cersei is permanently removed from power.

1489	Belisarius09	2014-05-11	I really liked the trial, well done by charles dance, NCW, and Peter Dinklage, all three gave convincing performances.Â  Also I was really glad to see the whole "have Tyrion join the NW" was legitimised, I've often felt in the minority in thinking Tywin was being sincere.Â  I think this reinforces it.Â 
Â 
I also liked the Stannis and Davos in Braavos scene.Â  Nice to see Davos shine, nice to see Stannis outside of the religious context, nice to see Braavos.Â 
Â 
Wasn't a huge fan of the Iron Born raid on the Dreadfort scene though.Â  Another show created subplot serving no purpose.Â  They are becoming more numerous and more poorly done this season.Â

well said...and i also wonder how that will play out in future books, since the hair net wasn't tossed into the boat, in my memory, which granted has the holding capacity of a bucket with no bottom...will Sansa be vindicated or condemned further by the necklace...and did I notice the young Queen-to-be feeling slightly anxious when talk turned to the necklace...

Â Seemed to me she put her own cruel little twists on it to humiliate Tyrion, with relish. Â I think D and D are counting on that last scene between Tyrion and Shae where he did tell her she was a whore, only to get her to leave for her own good, to somewhat 'justify' her testimony for the unsullied.

True, but to be fair to TV Shae, Tyrion swore up and down that he loved her, that his marriage to Sansa meant nothing, and that their relationship could continue--remember his big talk in 3x07 about setting up Shae in a nice house and providing for any children he fathered on her, which certainly implied that he saw a long-term, continuing relationship with her--only to wind up doing what she feared he would do for quite some time: reject her in favour of his marriage to Sansa. No wonder she's pissed.
Â 
It also seems implied in the 4x01 scene that TV Tyrion was already passive-aggressively inching out of his relationship with Shae by the time Varys warned him and led him to take a more direct approach, which probably fueled Shae's bitterness.

Well, she is a massive idiot. Remember the end of season 3, when Varys pays her a lot to leave?

Â Â  I don't necessarily think so. Shae had been feeling neglected by Tyrion for awhile now, due to his recent lack of interest in sex with her, and I think this kind of rejection was something she had started to fear. She was a common whoreÂ who suddenly found herself with a royal life. It would be natural for her to be paranoid that it was too good to be true, after a life of being made promises by men who just wanted to use her. I don't think, given Tyrion's recent ambiguous behavior towards her, it would be natural for her to come to the conclusion that he was doing it out of love. Its only natural for US to come to that conclusion because we are shown the dialogue with other people regarding his true feelings for her. But from her viewpoint, I think it's reasonable that she felt she had been genuinely rejected.

Â 
This. She really did seem nervous and scared...although maybe she was just "nervous" because she was trying to pass off her lies as truth. Her "nervousness" could just have been shiftiness.
Â 
With that said, there's a scene from the Season 4 trailer of her lounging on a bed with not a care in the world--shot in the dark, so not the 4x01 scene--so...
Â 
TV Shae was also dressed very nicely in her scene in 4x06. She seemed to be wearing a dead ringer for one of Sansa's old gowns, and she was wearing a pretty little gold necklace that she wasn't wearing before. Maybe this was a bit of a visual tipoff that TV Shae was profiting from her testimony.

Â 
rejected perhaps, but she surely knew her words of support would have been disbelieved and now that she must assume he is doomed she has to cast her lot with another powerful man if she wants to keep her royal life...let's see who show-Shae will find.... Â
1506	Mr Smith	2014-05-11	OK its going to take me a while to calm down from probably the greatest twenty minutes of Game of Thrones to date, but I'm going to try, and put forward rational arguments defending the choices made in these critical scenes.
Â 
Shae - I'm very happy with what they've done. I know some are suggesting such retaliation is unrealistic because she should have been smart enough to know why Tyrion rejected her, but for everything the writers have done wrong with Shae, they have made it clear that she isn't very smart. Tyrion repeatedly warns her of danger, and she is completely heedless and utterly reckless. She's never met Cersei or Tywin, she's never been on the end of their ruthlessness, its not really implausible that she wouldn't take the threat seriously. I'll be interested to see if any explanation is given as to how Shae got from "on a ship to Essos" to standing in a witness box; they sort of need to give more of an explanation than they did in the book.
Â 
Jaime and Tywin - Excellent stuff. Made things a lot more real, and made it look less like Tywin was outright rooting for Tyrion's execution, a path which I was worried they would go down. Great acting from both throughout, with Jaime's constant inner conflict and Tywin's smug "I know what I'm doing and I'm in control" charisma.
Â 
The Murder Weapon - Bringing the necklace back was the one low point in the trial. I get that they wanted to give Margaery a moment to struggle with her conscience, but I would have preferred they just say it was one of the poison's from Pycelle's stock, and show just how far of the mark they are about who their enemies are. It also seems implausible that Littlefinger would leave a loose end like that.
Â 
The Varys Moment - Another great little addition. Very much in tune with both characters, and appropriate to provide cushion for the fact that Tyrion and Varys have been much closer in the show than in the book.
Â 
Very pleased they kept the majority of the book dialogue.
Â 
The acting all round was absolutely SUPERB.
Â 
Well done D & D!
1507	Newstar	2014-05-11	Another thing that bugs me about Shae selling out Sansa at length is that not only did the show make a big deal out of Shae's love for Sansa, but while she was clearly souring on Tyrion and feeling increasingly resentful towards him, she not once showed anything but affection for Sansa after the marriage and never seemed to direct her anger about the marriage towards her. She was clearly concerned in 4x01 that Sansa was not eating. So it's a big mystery that the show just had Shae sell out Sansa with no other apparent motive--again, absent coercion--than jealousy, since she'd never taken out her jealousy on Sansa before.
1508	Dragon of Valyria	2014-05-11	It's a problem with their whole portrayal of Shae -- you can understand the betrayal of the rather more mercenary Shae of the books, but the betrayal of this Shae seems far more out of left field and certainly out of character as it's been presented to us.
1509	Seneti	2014-05-12	It was interesting how the bit with TV Shae was left ambiguous. She did seem genuinely nervous. Was she coerced? Did she act out of mercenary concerns? Out of spite? Was her testimony bought, or forced? Was she just putting on a good show of being scared, to make her story more convincing? As with the PW and with the RW on the show, we might get explanations after the fact making it very clear what TV Shae's deal was, why she did what she did, and who if anyone was behind her testimony.
Â 
I did like Jaime trying to make a deal to save Tyrion's life (and Tywin smugly quaffing his wine afterwards as Jaime had no doubt played right into his hands). PD's being praised for the episode and rightly so, but NCW was fantastic.


Â 
I agree on both those points. Shae looked vaguely uncomfortable throughout the entire sceneÂ - was she scared? Angry?Â Spiteful? I'll be happy to see the outcome of this. And Jaime offering his position as a KG in trade for Tyrion's life just made me go "dawwww". Here's two people who - so far - truly love and support each otherÂ (Jaime and Tyrion), which is a rare enough occurence in GoT.
Â 


Â 
TV Shae was also dressed very nicely in her scene in 4x06. She seemed to be wearing a dead ringer for one of Sansa's old gowns, and she was wearing a pretty little gold necklace that she wasn't wearing before. Maybe this was a bit of a visual tipoff that TV Shae was profiting from her testimony.


Â 
Wow, and here I was thinking that this was just my imagination! Seems Shae inherited Sansa's wardrobe as a reward for her testimony.
1510	Envie	2014-05-12	It's a problem with their whole portrayal of Shae -- you can understand the betrayal of the rather more mercenary Shae of the books, but the betrayal of this Shae seems far more out of left field and certainly out of character as it's been presented to us.


Â 
Yes it very much does seem further out in left field on the show as they've portrayed Shae in relation to her concern and care for Sansa which did not exist in the book. That is why I think most viewers will believe Shae has been coerced into her testimony. She certainly behaved genuinely scared and nervous enough to have been coerced along with the pointed looks she got from both Cersei and Tywin.Â 
Â 
Then again that may just be what they're trying to get us to believe to build up to the ultimate betrayal just before dear Tywin feels the need to visit the privy.
1511	Newstar	2014-05-12	I don't mind Shae turning on Tyrion out of spite and jealousy without being coerced--she'd been showing resentment and paranoia over their relationship as early as 3x02, so the signs were definitely there--but turning on Sansa, at least given how they've written TV Shae's feelings towards Sansa, which were always warm and loving no matter how pissed she was at Tyrion over the marriage, makes no sense absent coercion.
Â 
Wow, and here I was thinking that this was just my imagination! Seems Shae inherited Sansa's wardrobe as a reward for her testimony.
Â 
Not your imagination. The fact that she was wearing anything different at all jumped out at me since Shae's been wearing more or less the same outfit since the start of Season 2, and what made it even stranger is that the handmaidens in the show have a specific "uniform" (the halter dress Shae's been wearing), that's very different from the kimono-type gowns with metallic belts the highborn women wear, of the type Sansa wore in Season 2 and in Season 3. I think that was a very deliberate change, along with the pretty necklace Shae was wearing.

Â 
In the books she turns on Tyrion for some petty, material gain. That's the sort of thing that could make a person in Tyrion's position just sick with humanity in general.
Â 
In the show, she's more of an angry, rejected lover, taking revenge on the man who turned her out. Far less compelling-- not to mention less believable.

1513	Newstar	2014-05-12	I'm guessing the show will clarify TV Shae's motivations when Tyrion confronts her in (I assume) 4x10, although if I had to guess, her explanation to Tyrion will be "Because fuck you, that's why."

1514	HouseHarrison	2014-05-12	Humiliating and seeking revenge on Tyrion for rejecting her is one thing, but throwing Sansa, the girl she once said she would kill for, under the bus as well? Not cool (assuming no coercion).


Â 
Shae's a shameless bitch. It's good the show actually is going back to the characters roots in the book. Throwing anyone under the bus for the right price is exactly what GRRM's version of the character would do.

Â 
I also noticed the outfit she was wearing - it seemed too big for her. I could almost swear that was meant to be Sansa's clothing she was wearing and didn't Sansa wear a necklace just like that from previous seasons / episodes? We should comb back through old footage to see... major clue there if she's wearing Sansa's stuff...Â 
Â 
Also, on the topic of necklaces - I freaking KNEW when Littlefinger threw the necklace back on Dontos' dead body that it would be found and that was done purposely... they've played up the whole Sansa scapegoat angle way way too much for my liking personally. It wasn't that obvious in the books but they always seem to feel the need to bash us over the head. In the book it was merely implied perhaps Littlefinger set it up to look like Sansa was partially to blame and a possible accomplice with Tyrion once she disappears. I just don't buy it that Littlefinger would leave a loose end like that necklace and Dontos dead body for them to find. I really don't think it's that easily believable.Â

Â 
Well, sure, but TV Shae's never been about the money, and she's always been nothing but loving towards Sansa since 2x06, no matter how jealous and resentful she was when it came to the marriage.
Â

Â 
Sansa never wore a necklace like the one Shae was wearing in this episode. Sansa did have a pink dress very like the one Shae was wearing in this episode, but it got trashed during the riot in 2x06.
Â 
I do think the nicer outfit was a tipoff that Shae's been compensated amply for her testimony, but I don't think that money motivated TV Shae; it was probably just a nice bonus to accomplishing her main objective (revenge on Tyrion).
Â 
Â 
Also, on the topic of necklaces - I freaking KNEW when Littlefinger threw the necklace back on Dontos' dead body that it would be found and that was done purposely...
Â 
Me, too. That seemed entirely too deliberate--why not throw both the necklace and the body overboard?--and I'm glad to have had that suspicion vindicated in 4x06.
Â 
Â 
Â

1517	joachim	2014-05-12	Cersei probably thinks that Tyrion arranged her escape. More significant is that someone noticed that Sansa was wearing that necklace. "I mean, really, how often do you look at a man's shoes?"

					
					
							Edited by joachim, 12 May 2014 - 01:44 AM.
1518	Banner Without Brothers	2014-05-12	If her motivation was coercion I don't think she would have thrown in the personal details that she did. The "I am yours and you are mine" bit. She threw that in specifically to hurt him as much as she could. I think it was definitely spite.
1519	Daenerys Targaryen's slave	2014-05-12	Sometimes you'll hear about murderers from their friends or family "i never thought it, he was so nice and lovely".
Â 
Just because Shae was bubbly for most of the series doesn't mean she was incapable of betrayal. Just means the right triggers were pushed. Considering she's a whore, I'm sure if we were to see her life through her eyes then the whole situation with Tyrion would be spelled out.
Â 
It shouldn't have to be spelled out.
1520	Newstar	2014-05-12	I noticed on rewatch that unlike Book Shae, who came up with some truly ridiculous lies about Tyrion--he arranged for the death of the boy he was to marry, he raped her repeatedly, he forced her to become a whore, Tyrion killed Joffrey because he wanted to have the throne, etc. etc.--most of what TV Shae said about Tyrion, aside from the bits about colluding with Sansa to murder Joffrey and filching poison from Pycelle, was pretty much true.
Â 
Â 
If her motivation was coercion I don't think she would have thrown in the personal details that she did. The "I am yours and you are mine" bit. She threw that in specifically to hurt him as much as she could. I think it was definitely spite.
Â 
Yes. She took her testimony as an opportunity to air her grievances against Tyrion. Her account at the trial was really an account of all her outrage, anger, resentment, and heartbreak over the relationship. The lies about Tyrion murdering Joffrey were only the icing on the cake; the real meat of her testimony was the story of how Tyrion (in her mind) used her, abused her, took her love for granted, and ultimately threw her away in favour of Sansa.

Â 
You seriously think it's not believable that an angry rejected woman takes revenge on the man who rejected her? You clearly haven't seen many ugly breakups. People plan all sorts of elaborate revenge scenarios. "Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned" is a famous saying for a reason. You may prefer the book version of Shea's betrayal, but the show version is very credible. The unsullied won't have a problem with it.
1522	Newstar	2014-05-12	Having rewatched the scene, I'm not really seeing coercion. When Tyrion begs her "Please don't" and she looks at him, all her "nervousness" and fear drop away and the glare she gives him is one of pure contempt. This is definitely "Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned" territory.

Â 
She also jumps to the worst quickly. She flipped out when he once called Sansa a "great beauty" and goes into her "Shae, the funny little whore" act rather easily. Really doesn't seem outlandish that she wants some revenge after what Tyrion said to her.
Â 
I think part of her is forced, she seemed confused and scared when Tyrion demands trial by combat. Maybe part of her deal involved keeping him alive ala the deal Jamie struck.

1525	Emperoreddy	2014-05-12	REwatching this Jamie Tywin scene. I am starting to think Tywin expected Jamie to come to him with something like this. With how quickly he agrees, and Jamie gives this look like "shit, he is five steps ahead"
1526	TeamLemonCakeBraavos	2014-05-12	I'm predicting that when Tyrion confronts Shae she's going to say something to the effect of, "I'd rather see you both dead, then see you happy together." And then he'll kill her.
1527	DrownedSnow	2014-05-12	Ditto about Shae, Ditto underlined. Â She may have been coerced by T and C, but, damn, she really carried it to the extreme. Â Seemed to me she put her own cruel little twists on it to humiliate Tyrion, with relish. Â I think D and D are counting on that last scene between Tyrion and Shae where he did tell her she was a whore, only to get her to leave for her own good, to somewhat 'justify' her testimony for the unsullied. Â 


Â 
Â 
I agree with you and with others here. She wasn't some innocent lover being forced. She enjoyed that. I really don't care what the show tries to tell us, I will never believe Shae loved Tyrion. I hope he catches her sleeping with Tywin and kills her. They tried to make her likeable on the show but even show-only types don't like her so it was a lot of wasted time if you ask me. One of the few mistakes they've made with changing characters personalities.Â
1528	DrownedSnow	2014-05-12	REwatching this Jamie Tywin scene. I am starting to think Tywin expected Jamie to come to him with something like this. With how quickly he agrees, and Jamie gives this look like "shit, he is five steps ahead"


Â 
Â 
I think he just jumped at his good fortune that Jaime would come and offer him the thing he wants more for something he already planned to do. I do believe that book Tywin was going to send Tyrion to the Wall since his Lannister pride doesn't like to see his own die if he can help it.
1529	Emperoreddy	2014-05-12	Watching it again. She seems scared and off when she is telling the parts that are clear lies. About the plot. When she switches into describing their relationship she starts to get more into it and it seems more vindictive andÂ  its more lover scorned.
Â 
On another note, the music is EXCELLENT during the trial. Especially during the confession. This dark reprise of Rains of Castamere. Reallly well done. Everyone about the trial was well crafted. Acting, music, editing, cinematography. Hats off.
Â 
God that death stare between father and son is AMAZING. Their final confrontation is going to be epic.
1530	Nami	2014-05-12	I don't see why everyone is so excited about this Shae thing
They ruined everything when they wrote her as in love with Tyrion and their whole relationship.
Now it just seems she's pissed off at him and taking revenge ("I'm a whore, remember?"). If he ends up killing her it will just end the whole thing as a tragic love a la Romeo and Juliet because of a massive misunderstanding between them rather than the complete betrayal from her and how she played him like it was in the books.

Â 
Yup. Bryan Cogman confirmed as much in the interview up at ew.com about 4x06.
1532	Envie	2014-05-12	In the books, it's never been made explicit whether she turned on Tyrion for gain, out of bitterness, or through coercion. Possibly, a combination of all three.


Â 
And I think they did an excellent job of leaving show viewers wondering which of the three (or all three) are responsible for Shae's testimony.Â 
Â 
I agree with others on re-watch - - Shae starts out nervous and not very believable during the lies about Tyrion plotting to kill Joffrey with Sansa, but by the time her testimony takes on a more personal note, all nervousness drops and she's pure spite and revenge so there's a tinge of both coercion (for the lies) and scorned lover paypack both. For as many people who disliked Shae's actor ability, she really nailed this scene perfectly.
Â 
Even though they portrayed show Shae as much more sympathetic to Sansa and 'in-love' with Tyrion than in the books, the end result at the trial is still just as powerful in my opinion. Nothing could take away from that shocker and non book viewers had to have been appropriately shocked by her betrayal which makes the next one even more dramatic.

It comes close, if not his best one.

Â 
And the Tyrion eye challenge to Tywin at the end - naked hate and a hint of pain from Tyrion, and fury and some surprise from Tywin.

Â 
Â 
I think what they did with the character here was really good work. The problems arise wholey because of how they changed the character previously, especially during S3. GRRMs stated issues on the matter have been born out. They will get to the same point, but it will not be as satisfactory because of their creative writing.Â

Â 
Â 
To me book Shae wasn't a betrayal because all she was ever loyal to was the money. Her purpose is to open Tyrion's eyes and remind him that even he can be blinded, despite his intelligence. He knew she was a whore but craved love so desperately. It shows us a lot about who he is as a character and I think it's an important step for him. Yes, he spends time afterward being bitter and feeling sorry for himself but that is a lot more about his current station in life and the revelation about his first (and true) love. He's bitter at the world. I think show Tyrion is going to get lost down the bottom of a bottle for a long time, and it will primarily be about Shae. Maybe he will kill her and get emo about it for two seasons. Much less interesting to me,

Â 
God that eye challenge was great. That little smirk he gives at then end of it. Even better that it seems Tywin is doubly mad if his plan was never to actually execute Tyrion. Now he knows he will die, and that Jamie may volunteer and he could lose him which is even worse. I honestly can't get enough of this scene. Dinklage is just SO good. Dance doesn't have to do much heavy lifting but he is always good.Â 
Â 
PW was excellent, but this episode blows everything out of the water.

1537	SkaggCannibal	2014-05-12	Scene was great of course and better than I expected, but was I the only one missing the "Giant of Lanniser"? I was waiting for it and a bit disappointed when it was just replaced by "Lion of Lannister". That sentence and all the laughs were perfect to get Tyrion to lose his temper, with all the years of dwarf-mocking coming to the surface. Well, guess this was good too.
1538	Knight of Ashes	2014-05-12	Book and show are vastly different at this point.Â 
Â 
TV Tywin is not Book Tywin.
Still open to interpretation as to whether Book Tywin meant it; But I'll go with yes if only 'cause it makes things more tragic. Because you know, there's not enough tragedy in the books. For me.

1539	Pod The Impaler	2014-05-12	Another thing that bugs me about Shae selling out Sansa at length is that not only did the show make a big deal out of Shae's love for Sansa, but while she was clearly souring on Tyrion and feeling increasingly resentful towards him, she not once showed anything but affection for Sansa after the marriage and never seemed to direct her anger about the marriage towards her. She was clearly concerned in 4x01 that Sansa was not eating. So it's a big mystery that the show just had Shae sell out Sansa with no other apparent motive--again, absent coercion--than jealousy, since she'd never taken out her jealousy on Sansa before.


Â 
Â 
I see Shae's motivations as one of spite after Tyrion broke her heart (to save her life, but she didn't understand that).
Â 
That's a big difference from the books of course, but it was really telegraphed in the show by the emotional direction the whole Tyrion-Shae relationship had been given to begin with.
Â 
Of course there is still room for some ambiguity there too - a few things that might add up to a rather big surprise.Â 
Â 
In any case, nice trial for the most part: Tyrion ... gets no witnesses, almost no questions. Ah, medieval justice.
Â 
The trade-of Jaime made is something that made sense - since Kevan Lannister is not in this and Jaime was back so damn early. Also, Jaime sort of knew Shae was coming next on the witness list, didn't he? "No outbursts", LOL, not happening.
Â 
Tyrion's tirade in the court ... I think they mostly got it right. "Dear King's Landing... Fuck you all. I hope someone invents nukes just so one can be dropped on this place. Signed, Tyrion The Imp The Twisted Monkey Demon."

Her not uttering that line makes the Unsullied more unsure about her motivations and her feelings for Tyrion. She never called him "Giant" on the show so we know that is a lie.

Â 
Â 
Yeah, there is just not as much sexual humiliation the way the show did it - no "my giant of Lannister". In the book that was the most painful part of the trial - she says that, and the whole room is bursting out laughing.
Â 
As additions go, I really did like that his speech sounded a tad more venomous.
Â 
I thought it was clever that they threw in those allegations of Young Wolf sympathies. Plus that Sansa is accused of supposedly offering up her virtue at the cost of Joffrey's life - and he supposedly committed treason and kinslaying just to be able to bed her.
1546	Charles Phipps	2014-05-12	I think the Sansa jealousy business was a ridiculous change but I think the other changes to Shae were good ones. Part of what George R.R. Martin does well is highlight what [censored] the whole Medieval values system is. Shae is a prostitute but she's a human being first and bringing up this doesn't make her anything more or less than a person plying her trade is a good thing.
Â 
Yes, in the books, it's TYRION who makes up the relationship in his head but showing he wanted to "buy a girlfriend" isn't a bad thing for me.
1547	SpaA<U+009F>vogel	2014-05-12	I remember thinking about how great that speeach was in the book--Dinklage elevated it here.Â  I almost got up and cheered.Â
1548	Charles Phipps	2014-05-12	Another thing on the Shae version is that you can read class and money subtext from mercenary Shae into the Sansa-Shae jealousy. People are talking about how Shae being jealous of Sansa is ridiculous and how it was all about the money for Shae but I think it's interesting to view it in the context of how money warps the relationship of Tyrion and Shae.
Sansa is a "proper" wife because of her class and position.
Shae is a prostitute.
Â 
Shae's fears about Tyrion wanting Sansa may well be class-conscious.
1549	Pod The Impaler	2014-05-12	Yes, in the books, it's TYRION who makes up the relationship in his head but showing he wanted to "buy a girlfriend" isn't a bad thing for me.


Â 
Â 
Well, to be fair in the books, they lean much more heavily on the idea that virtually every woman is disgusted by him, and that he thinks a whore is the only kind of woman he could ever really get.
The show writers chose to make Shae more emotional and sympathetic, and they also chose to ease back on how deeply Tyrion is exposed to contempt by the world just for being a dwarf.Â

Â 
Â 
There was definitely a lot of this in the show with Shae. Not that sophisticated in presenting its complexity, but Shae certainly shows lots of clear insecurity about it. Varys' conversations with her dwell on it, and finally Tyrion seems to reject her for that reason. I think it started with her Roz conversation, where she is told the bells in Winterfell rang for a whole day when Sansa was born.

1550	Bungholes First	2014-05-12	Â 
And I think they did an excellent job of leaving show viewers wondering which of the three (or all three) are responsible for Shae's testimony.Â 
Â 
I agree with others on re-watch - - Shae starts out nervous and not very believable during the lies about Tyrion plotting to kill Joffrey with Sansa, but by the time her testimony takes on a more personal note, all nervousness drops and she's pure spite and revenge so there's a tinge of both coercion (for the lies) and scorned lover paypack both. For as many people who disliked Shae's actor ability, she really nailed this scene perfectly.
Â 
Even though they portrayed show Shae as much more sympathetic to Sansa and 'in-love' with Tyrion than in the books, the end result at the trial is still just as powerful in my opinion. Nothing could take away from that shocker and non book viewers had to have been appropriately shocked by her betrayal which makes the next one even more dramatic.


Â 
She seemed quite horrified when Tyrion demanded his trial by combat. It's almost like she made a deal with the agreement that he lives if she gives testimony, but is now sure that he will die.

Â 
Â 
Could be indicative of a later twist. She did not expect it, had other ideas maybe.Â 
We still do not know what took place between her being taken to a ship and her being brought back for the trial.
1552	Charles Phipps	2014-05-12	In any case, I'm entirely cool with the idea Shae is a relatively okay person who just gets caught up in the Game of Thrones and dies horribly for it. Yes, she betrays Tyrion but the ambiguity of the whole thing will make the moment when he shoots her in the chest all the more poignant.
Â 
It's the "big thing" along with Tywin's death that will be this season's stinger like the Red Wedding or Ned's death.
Â 
I also think, after this, Tyrion will remain a sympathetic murderer while Shae will be a sympathetic victim.

Tyrion also believed his first wife was a whore so he is attempting to recapture his feelings for her, there's subtext to as well.

Â 
I wonder if we'll discover what happened through Shae herself in the Tower of the Hand, or if Cersei or Tywin lets it slip earlier?
Â 
Fantastic scene. Dinklage killed it, and even I felt like I had bloodlust as he was spitting venom at everyone.
1554	kishefmakherin	2014-05-12	Sansa's dress.
1555	Red Tiger	2014-05-12	Â 
True, but to be fair to TV Shae, Tyrion swore up and down that he loved her, that his marriage to Sansa meant nothing, and that their relationship could continue--remember his big talk in 3x07 about setting up Shae in a nice house and providing for any children he fathered on her, which certainly implied that he saw a long-term, continuing relationship with her--only to wind up doing what she feared he would do for quite some time: reject her in favour of his marriage to Sansa. No wonder she's pissed.
Â 
It also seems implied in the 4x01 scene that TV Tyrion was already passive-aggressively inching out of his relationship with Shae by the time Varys warned him and led him to take a more direct approach, which probably fueled Shae's bitterness.


No, Tyrion was still more than willing to do this, provided that Shae would indeed leave KL and go someplace safe, but she stayed anyway.
1556	Raksha 2014	2014-05-12	Watching it again. She seems scared and off when she is telling the parts that are clear lies. About the plot. When she switches into describing their relationship she starts to get more into it and it seems more vindictive andÂ  its more lover scorned.
Â 
On another note, the music is EXCELLENT during the trial. Especially during the confession. This dark reprise of Rains of Castamere. Reallly well done. Everyone about the trial was well crafted. Acting, music, editing, cinematography. Hats off.
Â 
God that death stare between father and son is AMAZING. Their final confrontation is going to be epic.


Â 
Â 
Oh yes; and Tyrion actually surprised Pops with the intensity of his death-glare. Â They were lion-to-lion here, and with actors of this caliber, the confrontation sizzled.
Â 
One other Great Acting Moment that really moved me in GAME also involved Tyrion/Tywin eye contact - it was back in Season 1. Â Tywin told Tyrion he was making him Acting Hand and called him his son. Â Tyrion's eyes showed first shock and then an awestruck belief that this was happening, that his father was entrusting him with something important - it was nuanced and credible and rather sad as well as triumphant; and for me, that's when Peter Dinklage earned his Emmy; to show with just his face all the insecurity and complexity of probably the most important relationship in the character's life.

Yeah it was great, nice to finally get to see a darker side to Tyrion which has been featured a lot less in the show than in the books up until this point
1559	OnlyOne	2014-05-12	Â 
You people need to stop.

But we won't. Suck it up.
1560	OnlyOne	2014-05-12	Will Shae just die already. Really. Just die.
1561	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-05-12	Loved it all. Tyrion went in dry with the monologue.
1562	Roose Seal	2014-05-12	Felt pretty conflicted about the whole thing.Â 
On the one hand, their treatment of Shae as a character so far has been appalling, but on the other, her scene at the trial was very well handled.
I don't doubt for a second that she was paid and/or coerced by Cersei into giving this testimony (as evidenced by her wearing Sansa's dress) but everything that comes before makes it seem like she was doing this out of spite and jealousy, which is frankly utterly ridiculous.Â 
I liked Shae in the books because she never lied about who she was, she was very clear that she was playing a role, very convincingly maybe, but it was still a role and Tyrion knew that, he just didn't want to see it. So I never considered Shae's testimony as a "betrayal", not anymore than Bronn refusing to fight for him. I simply saw it as a victim of horrible circumstances (a whore in a deeply misogynistic culture) trying to use what little agency she had to better her situation. I don't think any one of us could say they would've acted differently in her situation. What was she supposed to do? Lie to protect Tyrion and die? Refuse to testify and probably die as well? With the information available to her at the time, testifying against Tyrion was her ultimate act of self-preservation.
In the show, they turn the whole situation into a "hell hath no fury" kinda thing, turning the character of Shae into a terrible scorned and spiteful woman stereotype.

Anyway, I'm not surprised â<U+0080><U+0094> I've long stopped expecting this show to depict women as people capable of making their own decisions.
And now let's watch as they somehow turn Shae's murder into a heroic act for Tyrion.Â
1563	hallam	2014-05-12	I thought the books rather weak on the Shae part. The TV version is far more credible.Â 
Â 
It isn't just the scorned woman angle, it is the betrayal by the one woman he has trusted. Shae's speech isn't to get a guilty verdict, its to show that the offer of taking the black is going to be reneged on like with Ned. At this point it is going to look to Tyrion like it is Cersei's doing.
Â 
The TV and the book versions have very different constraints. GRRM can put a minor character close to a major character for three books and still have then be minor. That doesn't work on TV. Any character that is on screen as often as Shae is going to become major. So they have to have more motivation.Â 
Â 
It really would not work for Tyrion to be such a slave to his cock that he keeps a whore who he knows is just there for the money. So Shae has to be there for more than money and her betrayal has to be about more.
Â 
Don't forget that at this point Shae thinks Tyrion did it and that he is going to be executed anyway.Â 
Â 
The other key point is when Tyrion asks Varys if he remembers. Which is basically asking if Varys recognizes the debt and will help him.Â 
Â 
As for when Tywin gets the chop, I would think episode 9. Because they just had that big reveal on the Iron Bank which would be a bit of an anti-climax if viewers had to remember that speech about 'what if Tywin dies' to the next season. The cliffhanger will be the bank granting Stannis a loan.

Â 
Yes! This so much, they transformed Shae from a woman with sensible motives (albeit an unintelligent person) i.e her own financial survival, into a silly emotional "you hurt my feewings" woman.
Â 
Ugh.

He will definitely get an Emmy for that- as a dwarf he just poured all of his pain and rancor into that scene. Damn Peter Dinklage is hot...

Â 
Â 
Shae is supposed to be a useless throwaway character, that's the whole point of her. The show just wanted to add some "romance" and it's completely cheap since they didn't change anything for the courtroom scene and it just doesn't gel with the character they created. If she ever was truly in love with Tyrion there is no way she could have said the things she did in court the WAY she said them. Sorry, ain't happening. Even if she felt scorned and was bitter she took far too much pleasure to have even wanted the best for Tyrion. Now the show has created a problem where a character they tried to make a sweet love to pander to viewers is acting like a greedy, spiteful, whore. Will be worse if they try to give her a loving moment before Tyrion kills her, if he even does.
Â 
If they wanted to make a true romance with her and Tyrion then her testimony needed to be completely forced and reluctant. They can't just claim she was unwilling in an episode or two because we clearly saw she was enjoying burying Tyrion. They had a chance to keel their character consistent and they blew it. Just a proof wasted time on Shae these past few seasons. I'm more worried Jaime won't be revealing the truth about Tyrion's first wife to him. That's what he really needs to know about. Shae is his lesson about trusting people he knows he shouldnt and the truth about Tysha reveals that he can actually be loved. Something he's denied himself ever since by believing that only whores could stand to be around him.
Â 
Also, where do think Davos got all that money this episode? The bank is obviously funding them. Dude has to make it to the Wall so a bank loan couldn't be the cliffhanger.

Â 
I think the show did a very good job with something Martin kind of mistepped on, which is the fact that Shae is an excellent character for showing the nobles aren't any more important than the Smallfolk. People love Bronn, Gendry, Shae, and others because they give a "bottom up" view of the world versus the "top down."
I also don't think Shae and Tyrion had a romance in the literary sense but a relationship. Even in the books, Tyrion treats Shae (his whore) as his mistress. It's a big part of his characterization how utterly inappropriate Tyrion is by doing this. Tyrion would be perfectly normal to have a mistress.
Â 
It's just not someone of that particular profession.

So they just emphasized something in the books. As for Shae, her motives were always ambiguous in the books and remain so even now. Fans just decided she was only in it for the money. Which, she might have been in the show as well. After all, Tyrion was a much bigger meal ticket than diamonds right until he wasn't.

Shae did seem a little hesitant or at least nervous, but ok she cares about Tyrion at least a bit, but she likes herself way more obviously.  I guess the rest of her story will go exactly like in the books. I just don't know where Tysha comes in the story, she probably doesn't. So does that mean Tywin gets killed because he convinced Shae to testify against Tyrion? Because the whole Tysha ordeal makes it a far more compelling motive for me.Â

Â 
I think Tysha might still be included. They've brought her up a few times in the show, and I doubt they'd hammer that home unless it would amount to something.
1574	DrownedSnow	2014-05-12	People love Shae? That's news to pretty much everybody. I did have a friend one time ask me "she has to be important or something right? Why are they spending so much time on her when she is so annoying? I bet she's secretly a noble. Is she Khalessi's sister?" I laughed so hard on that one. Point is that even with everything they did hardly anyone liked the character. They mostly just confused people.Â 
Â 
Her motivations are actually really clear in the book. Fans didn't just make up that she's all about money, it's right there in pretty much every scene she shows up in. It's evident in her testimony and her sleeping with Tywin. Not sure how anyone could get confused unless they watched the show first and are trying impose some of that portrayal onto her.
Â 
In both versions she was a whore who was taking money from word one. She knee the score and you can't possibly argue she didn't. Her getting mad about him marrying Sansa didn't even add up on the show. It was very out of left field. Book Shae clearly only worried Tyrion would cut off her gravy train after he married Sansa. Once she was assured that wouldn't happen and he still wanted her around she didn't give two craps about his marriage.

It's not really odd. We know Varys has no designs on becoming King, which would never happen anyways. What he means is that he's interested in power, and will influence who will rule in Westeros, which any book reader already knows. It's only confusing if you don't like to use your brain.
1579	King Tyrion I	2014-05-12	That is obviously the best scene in the episode.
Â 
Peter nails the part. To the very last syllable of his speech. And his mimic. Every nuance of it.
1580	marsyao	2014-05-12	Â 
Another interesting change from the books is that Sansa's guilt seemed a lot more stark (no pun intended) in the show than in the books. I have no doubt that Littlefinger intended the necklace and Dontos' body to be discovered, to cement Sansa's guilt


Â 
This part actually bothers me, if littlefinger's plan is to marry Snasa to Robert, then he should not have her as a suspect of regicide, without that necklace, Sansan could claim she is innocent of what her husband's doing, otherwise how could Lord of Eyrie marry a lady who involves in murdering Â the king?
1581	Inv1ctus	2014-05-12	Yeah that bothered me too, it doesn't seem like LF to do something like this. Unless he is convinced the demise of house Lannister is imminent.Â

Â 
Maybe it's supposed to show LF getting a little bit careless? That's pretty much what's happening in the books with the Vale Lords, so it could just be set-up for that.
Â 
That or it was the show-runners really thinking we didn't get that it was the necklace. But if that's the case this is really hitting us over the head with it.

Littlefinger's plan isn't to marry her to Robert.Â  But even if it was, it wouldn't matter whether Sansa was implicated via necklace; the Lannisters would come to try and get her regardless.

1584	Tadco26	2014-05-12	I never bought TVShae and TVTyrion's relationship in the first place.Â  After sleeping with multiple whores at the same time in season 1, he decides to go mongomous, just because, and picks a whore who insults him from the start, and is constantly a high maintaince, jealous bitch.Â  What's to like, much less love?Â  They don't even have that many sex scenes and he turns them down completely by the end.Â  The show portrays it as ifÂ she truely loved him back, even though she was constantly complaining about things he did, and never seemed happy.Â  If it was just for the money it might make some sense initially, but after she rejected the generous offer to live expenses paid in Essos, that seems unbelieveable.Â  So either coercion, or jealous rage, but I'm not sure how eitherÂ one leads to ending up inÂ Tywin's bed.
Â 
BookShae was constantly seductive, and when she did complain, she did it in a seductive manner, not in entitled,Â high maintainance bitch style.Â  Tyrion knew in his mind that it was his gold she wanted, but she wanted to believe her and she did everything in her power to convince him of her affection.Â  It's hard to believe TVTyrion and TVShae's relationship in the first place, so when theyÂ do a very good adaptation of the book's trial scene and act as if Shae is the same character as in the book, it is a bit jarring.Â 
Â
1585	sati	2014-05-12	I find this whole praise for Dinklage to be baffling. I thought he really overdid it with all the expressions in the end - he came off as cartoonish villain instead of heartbroken and bitter. He was great with small moments like the little smirk he gives Tywin before the end and the look on his face when Shae walked in, but this? Emmy worthy? 1x09 was Emmy worthy. Here I saw an actor who phones it in and thinks material and little effort will do the job.

Pascal was my MVP of the ep. Did so much with so little.

Â 
Regardless, LF can't just parade Sansa around the Eeyrie, regicide or just pure escape with the suspicion of conspiracy to commit regicide. In the books he's only somewhat ready to reveal Sansa once the Lannisters are basically all done.

Yeah I found Dinklage's performance extremely hammy and over-the-top. There's no need to exaggerate your expressions so much when the camera is literally a inch away from your face.

1588	Seneti	2014-05-12	REwatching this Jamie Tywin scene. I am starting to think Tywin expected Jamie to come to him with something like this. With how quickly he agrees, and Jamie gives this look like "shit, he is five steps ahead"


Â 
Either that or he really just jumped at the opportunity. But I agree that there was definitely a "well that was too quick" moment on Jaime's side.
Â 


Scene was great of course and better than I expected, but was I the only one missing the "Giant of Lanniser"? I was waiting for it and a bit disappointed when it was just replaced by "Lion of Lannister". That sentence and all the laughs were perfect to get Tyrion to lose his temper, with all the years of dwarf-mocking coming to the surface. Well, guess this was good too.


Â 
We never had the "Giant of Lannister" line in the show, so it wouldn't make sense to include it here, especially since everything Shae said about her relationship with Tyrion was actually truth (even if presented in the worst light possible).
Â 


I love they kept in Pycelle's classic line.
Â 
Used to strike down the most noble child the gods ever put on this good earth.


Â 
This line had me laugh so hard (both in the books and in the shows). Pycelle really is lying through his teeth.
Â 


Â 
It's not really odd. We know Varys has no designs on becoming King, which would never happen anyways. What he means is that he's interested in power, and will influence who will rule in Westeros, which any book reader already knows. It's only confusing if you don't like to use your brain.


Â 
Personally, I think Varys was either trying to confuse the hell out of Oberyn or he was hinting at his agenda to procure the throne for the Targaryens (which he know has been on his agenda since season 1 when he had his little talk with Illyrio down in the dungeons).

I thought so at first then I reasoned that the character was playing it up and overdoing it for all the spectators around, so it made sense to me.

Most people when terribly upset act like buffoons and hams, so I thought it was fitting.
1592	Newstar	2014-05-12	The way the scene was shot and acted, you could really see Tyrion as "ugly" for the first time; he was so apoplectic with rage that his facial expressions were contorted, almost twisted. So it worked for me; unlike Book Tyrion, who was a lot more pissy and less genteel on average than TV Tyrion's been, all of TV Tyrion's rage boiled over at once, making the resulting outburst that much more intense.
1593	yushkevitch	2014-05-12	Ditto about Shae, Ditto underlined. Â She may have been coerced by T and C, but, damn, she really carried it to the extreme. Â Seemed to me she put her own cruel little twists on it to humiliate Tyrion, with relish. Â I think D and D are counting on that last scene between Tyrion and Shae where he did tell her she was a whore, only to get her to leave for her own good, to somewhat 'justify' her testimony for the unsullied. Â 


Â 
From everything we've seen about Show Shae - the jealousy, the spite, the tantrums - was it any surprise that even though she was clearly coerced she used her opportunity to try and hurt Tyrion in the most cruel way possible? (In case it's not clear I am in complete agreement with you: She didn't have to add the "I am yours, you are mine" line, she did that for thick, gooey, spicy relish)
1594	Tanith	2014-05-12	Most people when terribly upset act like buffoons and hams, so I thought it was fitting.


Agreed. That's how I interpreted all those facial tics and twitches. He was full of rage, sorrow, and despair and Dinklage pulled it off.
Â 
But there's a facial expression that impressed me even more, and that was Jaime's face when Tyrion stated "I wish to confess". It lasted only a heartbeat, but it was priceless.

I agree - this is the first time I felt Tyrion was finally being portrayed as the 'monster' he was described as in the books - both literally and figuratively. Going 'over the top' was not overdone or hammy in this situation - it was exaggerated to show Tyrion in a much less golden light than he's previously been shown all this time.Â 
Â 
People complain about how 'whitewashed' and good / handsome Tyrion is in the show compared to book Tyrion - yet when he finally loses his cool and gets enraged complete with spittle and red face, people think that's over the top? Everyone's a critic!
Â 
All things considered here - who among you would have kept your cool and composure and not overreacted to having just heard that lying betrayal that just came out of Shae's mouth moments before? Seriously. I think over the top rage was warranted and WELL DONE acting on Peter's part.

Excuse me, I'm allowed not to praise Dinklage all the time and have my criticisms. I thought he showed rage and bitterness far better in Second Sons. I found him way over the top last night and I seriously doubt Tyrion was 'overplaying it' for the sake of the people gathered in the room.

After some painful scenes in Meereen, I actually think Emilia's acting was great in this episode. The emotions flashing across her face made me think of all the reasons for them. It was great.

Â 
You don't have to excuse yourself, you're certainly entitled to your opinion of his acting as much as I'm entitled to disagree. I was quite satisfied seeing Tyrion in an 'overreacting' capacity for once. If you watch the "anatomy of a scene" on the HBO youtube channel you'll hear D&D talk about this - they mention how Tyrion has always kept his cool and played it off his whole life about the torment and disrespect he's received for being a dwarf. For once we see Tyrion lose his cool and drop that 'armor' he so eloquently spoke of to Jon Snow long ago... no one will ever forget who you are he said, and for this one moment he forgot who he was (while everyone else expected his monster routine) and he overreacted. It was not unbelievable and even if you felt it was overdone, it was fitting for the moment.
1603	PhoenixFlame	2014-05-12	It seemed to me very Shakespearean. The whole scene did, and that overall consistency was why it worked for me. Tyrion went into King Richard mode and embodied the villain they thought he was, so to his kangaroo onlookers, he was living up to their expectations. Tyrion was giving them what they wanted by ramming it down their throats and finally saying what he's wanted to for years.Â

I get the intent behind the scene, I just find the way Dinklage chose to play it to be hugely distracting. I literally went 'what is he doing?' during this scene and I almost never lose focus like that during an episode.
Â 
In any case the disservice was done here - the Giant of Lannister thing made him snap and itsÂ  inclusion would make his comical outburst a bit more plausible, at least for me.

Â 
Well I will agree with you they could have chosen better insults for Shae - but the fact is they didn't actually have Shae call him "The Giant of Lannister" previously so there was no way to bring that back in now. It's a pretty small exclusion really considering how much she did actually lie about and betray him about considering how 'in love' they made the two of them on the show in comparison to the more 'business like' arrangement they had in the books. They played up the romance part on purpose because they wanted the betrayal at the trial to seem that much more ruthless and terrible. They also had Tyrion flip out - which he did in the book too - might be worth a re-read. He acts completely out of character in the book too... he loses his composure completely and throws away any chance of taking Jaime's plea bargain deal with Dad... it was tragic in the books and they nailed it on the show. I think Tyrion's overreacting was spot on - he was ugly and going mental.Â

They could have her grossly lie about the Giant thing - make this up completely, not just manipulate the actual words that were said - which would result in Tyrion losing it.

Oh please, this is a character whose life is about to be taken unjustly, he is being publicly humiliated by virtually everyone he has been around, and just got the shock of seeing his one love participate in having him killed by throwing in all their secret intimacies along with a passel of lies designed to humiliate and debase him as much as possible.

I kind of liked that TV Shae, apart from the bits about Tyrion poisoning Joffrey to win over Sansa and such, pretty much gave a fairly honest account of their relationship, "my lion" nickname and all. I think it almost would have stung Tyrion more than Book Shae's ludicrous lies about Tyrion; Shae spilling all the real details of their relationship in such a humiliating and public fashion would be even more cruel than Shae just making shit up about Tyrion arranging for the death of the boy she was to marry, etc. etc.
1609	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-12	when Tyrion was pleading with Shae, i could have sworn that she was going to say Giant of Lannister next at which everyone bursts out laughing even more and boom! tyrion would snap exactly like he did...that was the one thing that would have made his trial perfect imo...

Â 
Â 
LF in the show failed to set fire to the boat with Dontos' body in it, and he tossed the purple-gem-object in there too. It would be plausible that someone found it.
Both are changes from the book, but while I can understand it being used in the trial, the fact that Dontos was found dead in a boat leads to the inevitable conclusion that Sansa would have escaped by sea. So I'm not sure how they plan to deal with that fact, if at all.

Â 
Â 
Yeah, the part about him having plotted against Joffrey and so on, he would understand that she could be coerced to say such things, but the inclusion of the personal intimate stuff between them, that was pure humilation. The show actually toned down just how total and public his humilation was; in the books it ("giant of Lannister" followed by an uproar of laughter from the entire court & audience) was so much nastier and more personal. They weren't just condemning as a criminal, they were destroying him as a man, and this is what finally pushes him into that venom-spitting rage.
1611	JonInVa	2014-05-12	Â 
Â 
I agree with you and with others here. She wasn't some innocent lover being forced. She enjoyed that. I really don't care what the show tries to tell us, I will never believe Shae loved Tyrion. I hope he catches her sleeping with Tywin and kills her. They tried to make her likeable on the show but even show-only types don't like her so it was a lot of wasted time if you ask me. One of the few mistakes they've made with changing characters personalities.Â 


Â 
Agreed. And the fact that she turned on Sansa after saying "she'd die for her" is the extra oomph needed to let the audience accept that Tyrion is justified when they next meet (not that he needs any more justification).

No, it was definitely Sansa's necklace. Littlefinger had smashed one of the stones on it and threw it back on Dontos's corpse.

Â 
Right. It's most definitely the same necklace with several stones now missing or crushed. Littlefinger purposely threw that necklace back on Dontos body and purposely left them both as clues. Why, I have no idea. In the books he dumps the body overboard... no evidence of Dontos connection. In the show, they leave Dontos floating in a rowboat with an arrow through his head and the necklace laying there conspicuously on his body... no that's not obvious at all! Sansa obviously didn't shoot Dontos and throw her necklace down - but apparently no one at Tyrion's trial is interested in trying to connect who the accomplice is that shot Dontos and put the necklace there and then whisked Sansa away. Pretty big obvious evidence there ...Â 
Â 
They did it for the dramatic effect. Littlefinger wouldn't have done that and in fact didn't do it in the book. The show writers wanted the necklace to get back to King's Landing because they feel the need to keep bashing viewers over the head with it.
1616	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-05-12	Drogon stealing the goat wasn't subtle enough. I felt they overdid it with the fire and his roar sounded forced.

1618	Caucasian_rodent	2014-05-12	After today's episode I think Shae has genuine feelings for Tyrion. When he adresses her for the first time you can hear how her voice falter before continuing her speech. Also, just after Tyrion demands a battle trial you see how she looks very surprised and franctic (eyes flitting back and forth). Clearly, this is something she did not expect nor wished for.
My hypothesis is that Shae was not coerced into doing what she did in that sense that her life was threatened. I rather think she was offered a deal by Tywin in much the same way Jamie was = "you tell on him, make him look bad / guilty, and I make sure he survives and send him to the Wall".
This would also be more fitting of the personality we have seen in Shae so far (i.e. she knew she was living a risky life with Tyrion and agreed to it anyway. I can see her resigning herself to being killed).
In other words: Shae is trying to protect Tyrion by doing what Tywin asked of her so that he will be send to the Wall rather than killed.
I think that Tywin did not expect Tyrion to be that deeply in love with Shae. He wanted Tyrion to be pushed, but not that far.
Â 
EDIT: Also, I think that the show is not really deviating from the books here. The difference is, that we are not biased by Tyrion's POV in the show.

Having emphasized the Shae/Sansa relationship in the past, I would guess they thought it would be dramatic for her to say that sort of thing (much as with Tyrion).
Â 
I don't think this is a big change either way, in terms of the overarching narrative.Â  Pretty much everybody in the books took it as a given that Sansa was involved, which was really the only logical inference from her disappearance (and, indeed, she was "involved", albeit unintentionally).Â  And Shae said she was involved, even if not quite so strongly.
1621	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-12	Â 
Right. It's most definitely the same necklace with several stones now missing or crushed. Littlefinger purposely threw that necklace back on Dontos body and purposely left them both as clues. Why, I have no idea. In the books he dumps the body overboard... no evidence of Dontos connection. In the show, they leave Dontos floating in a rowboat with an arrow through his head and the necklace laying there conspicuously on his body... no that's not obvious at all! Sansa obviously didn't shoot Dontos and throw her necklace down - but apparently no one at Tyrion's trial is interested in trying to connect who the accomplice is that shot Dontos and put the necklace there and then whisked Sansa away. Pretty big obvious evidence there ...Â 
Â 
They did it for the dramatic effect. Littlefinger wouldn't have done that and in fact didn't do it in the book. The show writers wanted the necklace to get back to King's Landing because they feel the need to keep bashing viewers over the head with it.


Â 
probably trueÂ

Â 
It's nice to know the actress playing Shae argued for a change to the script because it didn't feel consistent with her previous relationship or actions with Sansa. I felt this way too. They should have either made Shae unsympathetic to Sansa (as she was in the books) or stuck with the sympathy angle and not had Shae throw Sansa under the bus at the trial. It's just one minor quibble in an otherwise solid performance and scene.
1623	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-12	Drogon stealing the goat wasn't subtle enough. I felt they overdid it with the fire and his roar sounded forced.


Â 
i'm glad it wasn't subtle...i've been dying to see the dragons in actions since Astapor, even then, dragons weren't on focus...what's the point of them spending so much on CGI for dragons if we don't even get a good shot of them...i just wish they showed some of Raeghal and Viseron tooÂ
1624	Lord Damian	2014-05-12	Shae is so vile. I dont care who knows it, i fucking hate her and always will. I have to give the actress props for being somewhat decent for once. She knew that was a big scene for her character so she mustered effort. Personally, all that shit about Sansa was sheer spite. I do think she was coerced by Tywin and Cersei both.
Â 
As for the trial, Dinklage rocked ass with his speech. A thousand lying whores may be "where do whores go" for the show. Maybe.


Well, it is a power thing with Sansa. They know Sansa will be a widow and a virgin at that, the person with the best claim to the North and she is OUT of their control. So, lets make her a wanted criminal for Regicide with the punishment of death. Next best thing than having her in their control. I could see Tv show, having her marry Jaime if she never got away and Tyrion killed or Nights Watch but that will not happen.

Â 
You're right. Perhaps I'm just reading way too much in to it (as is my tendency). I guess I'm just confused as to why they over-emphasize or under-emphasize certain things. I mean, I'm not complaining, I'm just genuinely confused. That Sansa is brought up in the trial and accuse (even by Shae) does indeed happen in the books, but I guess...not to this degree. I never read it as being overly emphasized. In the show, they broke out the necklace and made up a very plausible, "Tyrion did it all for the nookie" story that would have me convinced if I had no idea what was going on. Humph. I don't know. Jut felt like the over-emphasis felt weird. But in the end, you're probably right. Most likely means nothing and was inserted for dramatic effect.Â
1626	Gabriel Belmont the Dragon	2014-05-12	What the fuck was shae thinking did she not figure out Tyrion was trying to save her from becoming a Tisha part 2 Tywin does nasty shit if he feels slighted but no Shae thinks her and Tyrion could win. And Peter Dinklage performance was powerful. And every one in the courtroom is a cunt.
1627	SummerSong	2014-05-12	Oh please, this is a character whose life is about to be taken unjustly, he is being publicly humiliated by virtually everyone he has been around, and just got the shock of seeing his one love participate in having him killed by throwing in all their secret intimacies along with a passel of lies designed to humiliate and debase him as much as possible. Â You think his facial expressions should beÂ subtle in that situation?


  Â Tyrion has had to eat shit his whole life, and this grossly unfair, humiliating farce of a trial â<U+0080><U+0093> manipulated by his own family and including Shea's very personal betrayal â<U+0080><U+0093> pushed him over the edge. For once he said what he truly thinks instead of being diplomatic. This is an understandable and very human reaction when we are pushed to the limit. His emotional outburst reflects a lifetime of pent-up rage, and in the heat of the moment he made a high risk life-or-death gamble. We also know Tyrion would loathe the "compromise" of being sentenced to the Night's Watch for the rest of his life, so that probably also played a part. He's screwed either way.
Â 
IMO the scene was powerful and believable as is. PD totally nailed it; his words and emotions made the scene electric. Bravo! I can't wait to watch the fallout.
Â 


LF in the show failed to set fire to the boat with Dontos' body in it, and he tossed the purple-gem-object in there too. It would be plausible that someone found it.
Â 
Both are changes from the book, but while I can understand it being used in the trial, the fact that Dontos was found dead in a boat leads to the inevitable conclusion that Sansa would have escaped by sea. So I'm not sure how they plan to deal with that fact, if at all.


Â 
Yes. LF deliberately tossed Sansa's necklace on top of Dontos in the boat and left them to be found by others, either by being washed ashore or discovered by a passing boat. He is too cunning to have thoughtlessly left this damning loose end, so it had to be deliberate. Why does he want to clearly implicate Sansa in Joffrey's murder? It's literally life-threatening, and I thought he wanted her alive and under his control.

Why would that need to be dealt with.Â  That she took a boat doesn't lend itself to any particular destination.

Â 
True...too bad Brienne missed that memo though.
1630	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-12	I find this whole praise for Dinklage to be baffling. I thought he really overdid it with all the expressions in the end - he came off as cartoonish villain instead of heartbroken and bitter. He was great with small moments like the little smirk he gives Tywin before the end and the look on his face when Shae walked in, but this? Emmy worthy? 1x09 was Emmy worthy. Here I saw an actor who phones it in and thinks material and little effort will do the job.
Â 
Pascal was my MVP of the ep. Did so much with so little.


Obviously everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I suppose I didn't find it over the top just because he was really spewing out a lot of things that were building up in him for his entire life. I found his expressions to really demostrate how furious he was with everyone and that he had finally snapped. After all the Tyrion "whitewashing" talk I guess I really appreciated him going apeshit on everyone.
1631	Brewmaster	2014-05-12	Why does he want to clearly implicate Sansa in Joffrey's murder? It's literally life-threatening, and I thought he wanted her alive and under his control.


Â 
So that Sansa has nowhere else to go. It was pretty much the same in the books (though some have argued the point with me, in regard to how much agency Sansa has). She's Littlefinger's hostage in all but name. He needs her to feel not just grateful for rescuing her, but needs her to know she is complicit in Joffrey's murder, so she feels that she'd be hunted if she left his protection.
Â 
He wants to be the only person Sansa feels she can trust- they've committed a crime together, whether she was a willing participant or not. If the world knows (or if she thinks the world knows), who else can she turn to?
1632	Colonel Green	2014-05-12	True...too bad Brienne missed that memo though.


Hey, she's going to the Wall, which is best-reached by sea.Â  By land, for some reason.Â  I guess she didn't hear about Moat Cailin being held by the Ironborn.
1633	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-12	The way the scene was shot and acted, you could really see Tyrion as "ugly" for the first time; he was so apoplectic with rage that his facial expressions were contorted, almost twisted. So it worked for me; unlike Book Tyrion, who was a lot more pissy and less genteel on average than TV Tyrion's been, all of TV Tyrion's rage boiled over at once, making the resulting outburst that much more intense.


This.
1634	gash	2014-05-12	did littlefinger not throw that necklace into the sea?

...was going to reply to several but this sums the scene up perfectly from my point of view...they wanted to see a monster, in fact they always saw a monster...he showed them that they didn't know shit about what a monster really is...

I don't know that that really works.Â  Tywin and Jaime struck that deal just before bell started tolling.Â  Jaime immediately returned to the throne room; Tywin was maybe 50-60 seconds behind, and Shae appears to enter the room from a completely different adjoining chamber.Â  And given that Tywin had gotten what he wanted, what was the purpose of wheeling out the super-humiliating witness who angers him off so much that he ruins the plan?

But tywin would presumably have already thought this ahead. Even if jaime had not come to him he would have still been able to send tyrion of to the wall. Tywin agreed way to fast to jaime to assume that he had t a.ready got plans kn motion.
1643	Colonel Green	2014-05-12	Even if jaime had not come to him he would have still been able to send tyrion of to the wall.


Why would he send Tyrion to the Wall without Jaime's deal?Â  Or, for that matter, without Tyrion asking for it?
1644	Adam de Felden	2014-05-12	Why would he send Tyrion to the Wall without Jaime's deal?Â  Or, for that matter, without Tyrion asking for it?
Because perhaps he doesn't want to order the execution if his son. That could be viewed by some as kinslaying.

Yep and it also makes me think of the play that is being put on in the Mercy chapter in TWOW.Â
1646	Natalia Borgia	2014-05-12	Sansa is on trial in absentia. That is why she is hiding in the Vale.
1647	Jairion Lannister	2014-05-12	The whole scene was superb. Dinklage's acting was great in particular, but I loved Tywin's disbelief at Tyrion saying he was on trial for being a dwarf. You can see Oberyn constantly channeling everything in; trying to realise what benefits him, and the reactions from the other characters are always evident but subtle, keeping you guessing (for non-book readers) at their motivations, wishes and whatÂ theyÂ actually want to happen with this whole thing. Brilliant scene and some of the best stuff the show has done so far.
1648	JDNight	2014-05-12	Â Â  I don't necessarily think so. Shae had been feeling neglected by Tyrion for awhile now, due to his recent lack of interest in sex with her, and I think this kind of rejection was something she had started to fear. She was a common whoreÂ who suddenly found herself with a royal life. It would be natural for her to be paranoid that it was too good to be true, after a life of being made promises by men who just wanted to use her. I don't think, given Tyrion's recent ambiguous behavior towards her, it would be natural for her to come to the conclusion that he was doing it out of love. Its only natural for US to come to that conclusion because we are shown the dialogue with other people regarding his true feelings for her. But from her viewpoint, I think it's reasonable that she felt she had been genuinely rejected.


Ok, fair enough.Â  Lets say we buy that she felt betrayed and could not see what else was going on in Tyrion's life.Â  Then she is an idiot for that.Â  For her to allow herself to get completely emotionally wrapped up in Tyrion given her situation makes her an idiot.Â  To be so wrapped up that she would throw away a fortune and risk all to humiliate him in court, speaks volumes to her stupidity.Â  Where does she think she is going with this?
Â 
It's one thing to be angry at a person and to let them know it.Â  It is entirely another thing to let the anger destroy any chance you have at a good life.Â  Not smart, to say the least.

Â  Well, with that train of thought, it would be easier to make the case that Tyrion is the idiot for falling in love with her, as he knows the dangers of that relationship in King's Landing even better than Shae did. As for her testimony in court, I think it is in part motivated by threats from Cersei and/or Tywin. Look what happened to Pod. She would actually be risking more by refusing to testify. And her recent 'betrayal' by Tyrion just makes her decision all the more easy.
1655	Bratchild	2014-05-12	I could also see Shae feeling like Sansa had just abandoned her to die on her behalf. Add to the fact that I think Tyrion had just broken her heart and there you go. So it was more revenge based. I had also seen something on youtube where the actress was talking about Shae in the scene and she mentioned that Shae had been threatened into testifying. Remember what Tyrion had told Pod in that first they would offer something wonderful before the threat.
Â 
I could also see Tyrion just about losing his mind and soul during the scene.I honestly thought,"Hello darkness, my old friend..."

Â 
Oh god yes. That one was heart-breaking. Superb acting from NCW.
Â 


I kind of liked that TV Shae, apart from the bits about Tyrion poisoning Joffrey to win over Sansa and such, pretty much gave a fairly honest account of their relationship, "my lion" nickname and all. I think it almost would have stung Tyrion more than Book Shae's ludicrous lies about Tyrion; Shae spilling all the real details of their relationship in such a humiliating and public fashion would be even more cruel than Shae just making shit up about Tyrion arranging for the death of the boy she was to marry, etc. etc.


Â 
Â 


Interesting to note: wicnet (on Tumblr) just posted an interview with the actress who plays Shae. She talks about wanting to take out the Sansa line in her testimony. She says she argued with D&D to take it out because it was inconsistent with what she felt were genuine feeling of 'care' for Sansa (by Shae) and also, with her character having JUST said that she'd "kill for that girl". Interesting that they left it in not only because of her protest...but also because not even in the books did they go "all out" in placing the blame on Sansa too. I wonder if there's a future purpose to doing this, or if its simply because they can.


Â 
Huh, that's certainly interesting. Say what you want about Sibel's acting skills, but she has a good eye for characterization issues...
Â

I wonder if there's a future purpose to doing this, or if its simply because they can.
Â 
I agree with Sibel Kekilli that it made no sense for TV Shae, as she'd been written, to go scorched earth on Sansa as well. If there had been any hint at all in Season 4 that she personally resented Sansa and was turning against her, it would be one thing, but the last we saw of their relationship was Shae urging Tyrion that Sansa needed to eat, which certainly seemed consistent with the sisterly concern and love she'd shown her previously. The writers could have set it up incredibly easily as late as 4x01--Shae rolling her eyes at Sansa crying over her family, acting aloof or even contemptuous with Sansa, etc. etc.--but they didn't, which makes Shae turning on Sansa just as she did on Tyrion much less believable.
Â 
To be fair to the writers, though, I get why they wanted Shae's condemnation of Sansa and Tyrion to be consistent with the story the trial was selling, of Tyrion and Sansa conspiring together to murder Joffrey. It wouldn't have worked if Shae had been contradicting the other witnesses' version of events, which leaned so heavily on Sansa's involvement. Tyrion and Sansa needed to be in on it together for the story as it was constructed to hold up--where Sansa was the drug mule, Tyrion procured the poison for Sansa to use, and Tyrion was motivated in part by his sympathy for his wife and the Northern cause--and it wouldn't do for Shae to insert her two cents about how there was no way Sansa could have been involved despite all the other witnesses' claims to the contrary, and to float her own theory that Tyrion had somehow acted entirely on his own, even though Sansa had worn the murder weapon.

1660	Mad Monkey	2014-05-13	I think the problem is that they wanted Shae's testimony to tie together all of the disparate pieces of evidence. Her testimony was basically closing arguments for the prosecution, presenting a grand unified theory that covers the motive, the means, and opportunity for the crime. If Shae cared for Sansa, she could have just left out Sansa's involvement entirely. It was already hinted by the other witnesses, she could have just focused her testimony on establishing Tyrion's motive. But the person pulling her strings -- Cersei -- wanted to drive home the theory that Tyrion and Sansa planned and carried out the assassination together.
Â 
Amusingly, it kind of highlights how stupid the prosecution's theory is. Cersei, LF, Olenna, et al have emphasized over and over how simple and dull Sansa is compared to the conspirators in King's Landing ("we're all liars here, and all of them better than you"). But in Shae's (Cersei's) version, Sansa is the brilliant master manipulator who used Tyrion and Dontos as pawns. This girl -- who has to be, what, 13? 14? -- managed to seduce Tyrion into killing Joffrey to avenge her brother, mother, and father, then left him holding the poisoned chalice to take the fall. Then she and Dontos disappeared off somewhere where she managed to overpower a much bigger man -- a former knight! -- filled him with crossbow bolts and dumped his body into the bay where he was found.
Â 
Why would Tyrion agree to this plan? If his motive is (as Shae/Cersei claim) sex with Sansa, why would he agree to a plan that involves him poisoning the king in front of half the court... a plan that guarantees his arrest and execution? He must have been the one to arrange for Dontos to take Sansa away, but why didn't he set it up so that he could go with them?
Â 
Before Shae's testimony, the case against Tyrion almost held together. It was obvious horse shit but as long as you look at each piece in isolation it worked. Tyrion DID have the poisons that were used to kill Joffrey. He DID threaten and insult Joffrey and his mother on several occasions. But when you put them all together it highlights how the whole thing makes absolutely zero sense.
1661	Hard Hugh	2014-05-13	All talks of whitewashing will have to be put on hold if Tyrion kills a Shae who was coerced, which is the feel I got from her seeming apprehension.Â 


Â 
See I worry this could be the biggest whitewash of all. If they don't kill her and have her become Tysha. Then reveal she only testified because Tywin or Cersi promised he could go to the wall if she did. It was all done for love.

See I worry this could be the biggest whitewash of all. If they don't kill her and have her become Tysha. Then reveal she only testified because Tywin or Cersi promised he could go to the wall if she did. It was all done for love.

I'd sooner believe in all those ridiculous 'Stannis will rape wildling women' ideas than this.
1664	Cersei the Great	2014-05-13	Â 
Yeah, the part about him having plotted against Joffrey and so on, he would understand that she could be coerced to say such things, but the inclusion of the personal intimate stuff between them, that was pure humilation. The show actually toned down just how total and public his humilation was; in the books it ("giant of Lannister" followed by an uproar of laughter from the entire court & audience) was so much nastier and more personal. They weren't just condemning as a criminal, they were destroying him as a man, and this is what finally pushes him into that venom-spitting rage.


I agree. Â The humiliation was what sent him over the edge and all the years of humiliation he endured came to a head and he went off. Â It was basically everyone against just him. Â
1665	Cersei the Great	2014-05-13	Â Tyrion has had to eat shit his whole life, and this grossly unfair, humiliating farce of a trial â<U+0080><U+0093> manipulated by his own family and including Shea's very personal betrayal â<U+0080><U+0093> pushed him over the edge. For once he said what he truly thinks instead of being diplomatic. This is an understandable and very human reaction when we are pushed to the limit. His emotional outburst reflects a lifetime of pent-up rage, and in the heat of the moment he made a high risk life-and-death gamble. We also know Tyrion would loathe the "compromise" of being sentenced to the Night's Watch for the rest of his life, so that probably also played a part. He's screwed either way.
Â 
IMO the scene was powerful and believable as is. PD totally nailed it; his words and emotions made the scene electric. Bravo! I can't wait to watch the fallout.
Â 


I totally agree with this. Â Well put.

In that situation, it was perfectly appropriate for Peter/Tyrion to act over the top. I would've gone crazy on those people too, and probably would have said "f*** you" to them individually, Cartman style ;-)

This part actually bothers me, if littlefinger's plan is to marry Snasa to Robert, then he should not have her as a suspect of regicide, without that necklace, Sansan could claim she is innocent of what her husband's doing, otherwise how could Lord of Eyrie marry a lady who involves in murdering Â the king?


Littlefinger's plans don't include Houses Lannister/Baratheon on the throne.Â  But now Sansa has no choice at all but to be "all in" with whatever Littlefinger's plans are...he's her only path to salvation.Â  It wasn't a loose end that Dontos and the necklace were discovered.Â  And if the discovery of the necklace puts the Tyrells off balance a little bit, that's certainly not a problem for him...they don't belong on the Iron Throne either.

This. If PD was ever going to go balls to the wall, maximum intensity, full Pacino, this was the scene to do it. It's a mark of PD's restraint to date that the scene hit as hard as it did.

Â 
I agree - this was the one scene where Tyrion's 'dwarf armor' cracked. He's spent his whole life wearing carefully constructed armor to deflect the hatred and criticism he's had simply because of a genetic disorder. Being 'half a man' his whole life has made him cynical, bitter and yet smart at the same time. One of my favorite scenes between Jon Snow and Tyrion is where he meets him and call him a "bastard" very pointedly and repeatedly. He then explains that Jon's sensitivity to it was his undoing and that he should wear his title like armor because then others cannot use it to hurt him. He said to Jon Snow:
Â 
Â 

	â<U+0080><U+009C>Let me give you some advice, bastard: Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor, and it can never be used to hurt you.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
That's what makes Tyrion's cracking in the trial scene so tragic. For all his defenses and armor, he forgot that one sage piece of advice. In being betrayed by Shae, he lost his head and forgot a lifetime of internal training. Had he remembered his own advice and kept his armor on - he would have done as Jaime instructed him, kept his mouth shut and pleaded for mercy to be sent to the wall as Tywin promised.Â 
Â 
But he didn't.Â 
Â 
He lost it.Â 
Â 
For everyone who keeps saying he 'over acted' the part - I don't think you've really ever seen someone come unglued and start ranting and raving in a true fit of rage. It looks pretty ridiculous and over-dramatic. Trust me.

Would Cersei or Tywin really present a champion that could kill him?
But I guess as kingsguard Jaime may not be allowed to fight for the accused and Tyrion would refuse him anyway.
Yes, Envie, I agree

1673	Hangover of the Morning	2014-05-13	Shae's confession was fantastic and much better than I expected. With the Tyrion/Shae dynamic being somewhat different in the show, I expected that the scene will make it obvious that Shae was coerced to testify.Â 
Â 
Peter Dinklage was fabulous in the scene and his changing facial expressions made it even more tragic. I couldn't believe how well did the Shae Â actress (sorry don't remember her name) pull it off. Never really thought much about her and found her annoying most of the time. She gave a great and very subtle performance and I couldn't tell whether she was lying or telling the truth. Just as in the books.Â
1674	Chebyshov	2014-05-13	I don't think Jaime expects Tyrion to choose him as champion. Aside conflict of interest, Tyrion is the one person Jaime confided in about how bad he is with his left hand.Â

Â 
Hmm, that is an interesting point that never crossed my mind. Obviously, I doubt that a member of the Kingsguard who are sworn to protect the king would be allowed to represent a person accused of killing a king.Â 
Â 
But if hypothetically Jaime would leave KG before the trial, would Tywin be OK with him dying on Tyrion's behalf or would he try to use some loophole to save his son? Cersei would probably try to seduce Jaime but if that wouldn't work she'd get mad and send The Mountain against him.Â

1678	jentario	2014-05-13	Â 
This. She really did seem nervous and scared...although maybe she was just "nervous" because she was trying to pass off her lies as truth. Her "nervousness" could just have been shiftiness.
Â 
With that said, there's a scene from the Season 4 trailer of her lounging on a bed with not a care in the world--shot in the dark, so not the 4x01 scene--so...
Â 
TV Shae was also dressed very nicely in her scene in 4x06. She seemed to be wearing a dead ringer for one of Sansa's old gowns, and she was wearing a pretty little gold necklace that she wasn't wearing before. Maybe this was a bit of a visual tipoff that TV Shae was profiting from her testimony.


I really think D&D muddied Tyrion up by making Shae's love legitimate. When he does what he does (and he better do it!), it will be completely heartbreaking. They both hurt eachother because of a misunderstanding- Shae isn't nearly as traitorous in the show as she is in the books. It's like taking Tyrion's sudden change and turning it up to 11. In the next episode, even Bronn will labandon Tyrion and Oberyn will be the only wildcard. I can not wait for gold to not be shat.

But yeah, if ever he was going to blow up, this was the time for it. Well, in a way, he is wearing the "monster" as armour.

This all the way. I've seen people going really mad and it's not subtle or dignified, it is truly scary and in many ways heartrending to behold cause all control or sense goes out the window.
Â 
Â 


Â 
I get the intent behind the scene, I just find the way Dinklage chose to play it to be hugely distracting. I literally went 'what is he doing?' during this scene and I almost never lose focus like that during an episode.


Â 
That's sorta what real madness looks like. There's really no other way for Dinklage to play this up.
Â 
In Second Sons he was angry with Joffrey yes, but this is much worse. It's not just his asshole nephew disrespecting him and threatening his wife (frustrating situation yes, but you can recover), it's all of the people he saved treating him with more venom than they ever did Stannis, wanting his head and his family ruining his life (The Wall would be almost as bad as death for Tyrion), there is no going back from this. Nobody was standing up for him (save for Jaime who was powerless) and he was truly alone in the world. That is not just anger or frustration, that is bottomless despair, a lifetime of hatred and unrelenting betrayal.

 Â  I prefer subtle acting and generally find overacting really irksome but it was perfect for this scene. It went from subtle to outburst to Tyrion being in control. Besides he was addressing lots of people who were far from him so he needed to be loud and theatrical to get his point through.Â
1684	Envie	2014-05-13	Â

Â 
Exactly! He went from wearing his carefully concealed "Don't care" dwarf armor to wearing a new set of armor - Monster armor. And that's the armor he'll be wearing going forward as part of his own transformation. Part of what I love about Jaime and Tyrion is the brother's parallel between how vastly different their lives become from the beginning of the saga as they both grow and learn more about themselves (and frankly become better men because of it). This theme is common in the book for many characters but for Tyrion it's very much heartbreaking yet inspirational because he's such a survivor that even after everything else has been taken from him and he's killed his lover and Father and escaped into the night like a common criminal, he still holds onto his will to live (he doesn't want to eat those poisonous mushrooms he found in Illyrio's garden in ADWD for example).Â 
Â 
Tyrion had very little hope of ever being more than the useless 'second son' and dwarf in his Father's eyes. Now, freed of that restraint, he can finally find himself a new life despite trying to drink himself to death in Pentos.
Â 
Â 
Â

Â 
Excellent points especially comparing how carefully 'controlled' he was with the Joffrey scene. Yes he was angry, yes he did a stupid thing to outburst and threaten Joffrey because of Sansa but he did all that without losing his full composure. If that's what people expected him to do in the trial scene then they really don't get the immense shock and betrayal he's just experienced at the hands of Shae along with his entire family (except Jaime) turning on him and wanting him dead right there in front of the entire court. It was tragic and he fully portrayed a person coming unglued and screaming out in a rage at his 'audience' perfectly.Â 
Â 
Remember, at this point, he has nothing else to lose. He even says he would rather lose his life than put up with the injustice and lies that are being put forward for show and that he truly wished he HAD poisoned Joffrey. It's one of those situations where you can understand that if a person's going to be humiliated and sentenced to die, they wish they'd actually made it worth it.
Â 
I hope people who are criticizing Peter's acting performance actually stop and try to put themselves in Tyrion's shoes for a moment ... just TRY to think what it must be like and how you might pop your cork in that very moment after Shae did that to him and Cersei is sitting over there smirking viciously at him the whole time and your Father is the judge who's going to sentence you ... would you keep your cool? Maybe some of you would - but Tyrion lost his and I think Peter portrayed it very well.
1685	Hodor's Dragon	2014-05-13	Even though I kind of lean toward agreeing with the "angry outburst" theory, "calculated outburst" also makes sense. Â 
Â 
Things were clearly going due south for Tyrion at the trial. Â He had to change the rules of the game somehow. Â Obviously, asking for trial by combat was one way, but perhaps an emotional outburst could shake things up, too. Â After all, anybody with a brain could see that there was a great deal of truth in Tyrion's words, and perhaps they would be more inclined to actually take action if his message was delivered as strongly as possible. Â Perhaps the subtext was "screw you if you're against me, but if you're on the fence let me put my case out there as strongly as I can and maybe I'll roust up some help somewhere."

Â 
Good points. I agree the effect was perfect especially as a lead-in for Oberyn who has been playing bored yet carefully paying attention and asking pointed questions of all the witnesses. In fact, of the three judges, Oberyn's been the only one to really ask any questions that made obvious sense in relation to uncovering possible lies or misinformation. Mace Tyrell is a complete moron and Tywin's toady so of course he doesn't contribute anything worthwhile and Tywin's carefully manipulating his own agenda.Â 
Â 
Tyrion's emotional outburst was mostly him just losing his cool. Minutes before he had agreed to do as Jaime asked him to do and said he trusted him. Enter Shae stage left and all composure and the "Plan" goes to hell. I'm not sure asking for trial by combat was a calculated thing on his part or not - it's definitely not the smartest move he could have made but as someone replied to me earlier - one of Tyrion's flaws has always been his inability to keep his mouth shut when there's something needing to be said even when it costs him points. I love him for that - no matter how smart he is he shoots himself in the foot and that's why so much of the 'evidence' against him is damning - because of his own mouth running away from him.

Â 
I don't know if I'd say I love him for it, but it damned sure makes him an interesting character. Â The things he says to screw himself over are, without exception, interesting and witty.
Â 
But Shae's testimony was more than the straw that broke the dwarf camel's emotional back, it was also a real game-changer as the trial goes. Â If her testimony is believed, then he cannot win even if the trial is fair. Â And if Tywin is setting it up this way, can Tyrion trust the deal? Â Sure, Jaime believes that he and Tywin have a real deal, but does Tyrion think he can trust a deal from Tywin? Â Especially now that Tywin has just done this to him? Â We know the answer to that question. . . .
Â 
Really, I'm kind of playing devil's advocate here, because I tend to go with the speech being emotion-driven, but there could be some logic behind it, too, if he doesn't trust the deal. Â And if it's logic, then he would use his real anger at Shae and Tywin to fuel his speech and make it more powerful and more effective.

Â 
It definitely had some calculation going on too - Tyrion's quick wit is partly why he's survived and thrived this long. In the midst of his emotional outburst I'm sure the thought occurred to him he was going to have to figure a way around the corner his Father has backed him into with the Shae testimony. For certain he does not trust his Father to keep his word even if Jaime does. Add to that Cersei will probably do just about anything she can to have his head removed (she is Joffrey's Mother afterall) and there were some quick calculations going on in that head of his as he's ranting and raving. It wasn't all just an act, I know this for certain, but the end result (trial by combat) isn't really a favorable choice IMO.Â 
Â 
Unfortunately, it worked for him at the Eyrie and I'm sure he's thinking it can work again. When Oberyn steps forward to be his champion I'm sure he thought he had it in the bag. I know I thought he surely did when I read it in the book - what a shocker.
1690	Skore	2014-05-13	Actually, I had an Unsullied ask me today if Jaime will want to fight for Tyrion but be forced to fight AGAINST Tyrion's champion (Bronn) because he is Kingsguard.
Â 
They obviously thought that Bronn would then proceed to make mincemeat out of Jaime as he kept doing it in the training excercises and Tyrion would "win" and be Tywin's heir.

That's a rather bleak prediction - I'm glad that's not the way it goes! I think your unsullied friend should be surprised and hopefully happy of the outcome that does happen.
1692	Khal Porno	2014-05-13	After today's episode I think Shae has genuine feelings for Tyrion. When he adresses her for the first time you can hear how her voice falter before continuing her speech. Also, just after Tyrion demands a battle trial you see how she looks very surprised and franctic (eyes flitting back and forth). Clearly, this is something she did not expect nor wished for.
My hypothesis is that Shae was not coerced into doing what she did in that sense that her life was threatened. I rather think she was offered a deal by Tywin in much the same way Jamie was = "you tell on him, make him look bad / guilty, and I make sure he survives and send him to the Wall".
This would also be more fitting of the personality we have seen in Shae so far (i.e. she knew she was living a risky life with Tyrion and agreed to it anyway. I can see her resigning herself to being killed).
In other words: Shae is trying to protect Tyrion by doing what Tywin asked of her so that he will be send to the Wall rather than killed.
I think that Tywin did not expect Tyrion to be that deeply in love with Shae. He wanted Tyrion to be pushed, but not that far.


Yes, I think that is exactly the case and it's odd that so many people here have overlooked these clues, most likely blinded by their hatred of the show version of Shae and Tyrion.
1693	Khal Porno	2014-05-13	jaime face after tyrion demand trial by combat. "ohh he will choose me."


I thought it would have been awesome if he had clutched his gold hand just then.
1694	Khal Porno	2014-05-13	Â 
I agree with Sibel Kekilli that it made no sense for TV Shae, as she'd been written, to go scorched earth on Sansa as well. If there had been any hint at all in Season 4 that she personally resented Sansa and was turning against her, it would be one thing, but the last we saw of their relationship was Shae urging Tyrion that Sansa needed to eat, which certainly seemed consistent with the sisterly concern and love she'd shown her previously. The writers could have set it up incredibly easily as late as 4x01--Shae rolling her eyes at Sansa crying over her family, acting aloof or even contemptuous with Sansa, etc. etc.--but they didn't, which makes Shae turning on Sansa just as she did on Tyrion much less believable.
Â 
To be fair to the writers, though, I get why they wanted Shae's condemnation of Sansa and Tyrion to be consistent with the story the trial was selling, of Tyrion and Sansa conspiring together to murder Joffrey. It wouldn't have worked if Shae had been contradicting the other witnesses' version of events, which leaned so heavily on Sansa's involvement. Tyrion and Sansa needed to be in on it together for the story as it was constructed to hold up--where Sansa was the drug mule, Tyrion procured the poison for Sansa to use, and Tyrion was motivated in part by his sympathy for his wife and the Northern cause--and it wouldn't do for Shae to insert her two cents about how there was no way Sansa could have been involved despite all the other witnesses' claims to the contrary, and to float her own theory that Tyrion had somehow acted entirely on his own, even though Sansa had worn the murder weapon.


It does make sense, because if she was compelled to testify and implicating Sansa was part of whatever deal she struck, then she would implicate Sansa as well.Â 
Â 
Most likely she would have objected to that, but Tywin wouldn't let her get out of it.Â  Unfortunately we will never know because those conversations happened off-screen.
Â 
EDIT: Sorry for the triple post, that's the problem with coming late to these huge multi-page threads.

Oy vey. As if this is an 80s movie with a training montage?


Only if you're playing this song
1696	Seneti	2014-05-14	Â 
Well most normal TV-watchers probably saw the trailer once (if even that) and thus hardly could register a duel between two characters that they weren't familiar with up to that point.Â 


Â 
This. I think most people on this forum overestimate the amount of attention that Unsullied play to peripheral material.
1697	Woman of War	2014-05-14	Exactly! He went from wearing his carefully concealed "Don't care" dwarf armor to wearing a new set of armor - Monster armor. And that's the armor he'll be wearing going forward as part of his own transformation. Part of what I love about Jaime and Tyrion is the brother's parallel between how vastly different their lives become from the beginning of the saga as they both grow and learn more about themselves (and frankly become better men because of it). This theme is common in the book for many characters but for Tyrion it's very much heartbreaking yet inspirational because he's such a survivor that even after everything else has been taken from him and he's killed his lover and Father and escaped into the night like a common criminal, he still holds onto his will to live (he doesn't want to eat those poisonous mushrooms he found in Illyrio's garden in ADWD for example).Â 
Â 
Tyrion had very little hope of ever being more than the useless 'second son' and dwarf in his Father's eyes. Now, freed of that restraint, he can finally find himself a new life despite trying to drink himself to death in Pentos.
Â 
Â 
Â 
This all the way. I've seen people going really mad and it's not subtle or dignified, it is truly scary and in many ways heartrending to behold cause all control or sense goes out the window.
That's sorta what real madness looks like. There's really no other way for Dinklage to play this up.
In Second Sons he was angry with Joffrey yes, but this is much worse. It's not just his asshole nephew disrespecting him and threatening his wife (frustrating situation yes, but you can recover), it's all of the people he saved treating him with more venom than they ever did Stannis, wanting his head and his family ruining his life (The Wall would be almost as bad as death for Tyrion), there is no going back from this. Nobody was standing up for him (save for Jaime who was powerless) and he was truly alone in the world. That is not just anger or frustration, that is bottomless despair, a lifetime of hatred and unrelenting betrayal.
Â 
Excellent points especially comparing how carefully 'controlled' he was with the Joffrey scene. Yes he was angry, yes he did a stupid thing to outburst and threaten Joffrey because of Sansa but he did all that without losing his full composure. If that's what people expected him to do in the trial scene then they really don't get the immense shock and betrayal he's just experienced at the hands of Shae along with his entire family (except Jaime) turning on him and wanting him dead right there in front of the entire court. It was tragic and he fully portrayed a person coming unglued and screaming out in a rage at his 'audience' perfectly.Â 
Â 
Remember, at this point, he has nothing else to lose. He even says he would rather lose his life than put up with the injustice and lies that are being put forward for show and that he truly wished he HAD poisoned Joffrey. It's one of those situations where you can understand that if a person's going to be humiliated and sentenced to die, they wish they'd actually made it worth it.
Â 
I hope people who are criticizing Peter's acting performance actually stop and try to put themselves in Tyrion's shoes for a moment ... just TRY to think what it must be like and how you might pop your cork in that very moment after Shae did that to him and Cersei is sitting over there smirking viciously at him the whole time and your Father is the judge who's going to sentence you ... would you keep your cool? Maybe some of you would - but Tyrion lost his and I think Peter portrayed it very well.I had to quote this post because you have said all I wanted to, only you did it better.

1698	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-14	I don't think Tyrion has really shown his claws and been as absolutely VENOMOUS as he was this episode. This bitterness of his is an important part of his character and he delivered that speech to perfection.Â

Â 
Aww thanks! It's nice to be appreciated in these debates as I've had to withdraw the claws in a few heated ones where people have disagreed and I'm a lot like Tyrion in that I should keep my mouth shut as an intelligent person but I tend to just say what I feel too often and it gets me in trouble.  At least I won't lose my head for it haha.
Â 
Tyrion's 'armor' line he gave to Jon Snow which I previously quoted is one of my all time favorite lines in the enitre book / series. In fact I think I'll change it to my signature quote. It's a creed to live by even in our real world for many of us who are 'imperfect' and know full well what it's like to be tormented for who you are.

1702	Gabriel Belmont the Dragon	2014-05-14	I think the problem is that they wanted Shae's testimony to tie together all of the disparate pieces of evidence. Her testimony was basically closing arguments for the prosecution, presenting a grand unified theory that covers the motive, the means, and opportunity for the crime. If Shae cared for Sansa, she could have just left out Sansa's involvement entirely. It was already hinted by the other witnesses, she could have just focused her testimony on establishing Tyrion's motive. But the person pulling her strings -- Cersei -- wanted to drive home the theory that Tyrion and Sansa planned and carried out the assassination together.
Â 
Amusingly, it kind of highlights how stupid the prosecution's theory is. Cersei, LF, Olenna, et al have emphasized over and over how simple and dull Sansa is compared to the conspirators in King's Landing ("we're all liars here, and all of them better than you"). But in Shae's (Cersei's) version, Sansa is the brilliant master manipulator who used Tyrion and Dontos as pawns. This girl -- who has to be, what, 13? 14? -- managed to seduce Tyrion into killing Joffrey to avenge her brother, mother, and father, then left him holding the poisoned chalice to take the fall. Then she and Dontos disappeared off somewhere where she managed to overpower a much bigger man -- a former knight! -- filled him with crossbow bolts and dumped his body into the bay where he was found.
Â 
Why would Tyrion agree to this plan? If his motive is (as Shae/Cersei claim) sex with Sansa, why would he agree to a plan that involves him poisoning the king in front of half the court... a plan that guarantees his arrest and execution? He must have been the one to arrange for Dontos to take Sansa away, but why didn't he set it up so that he could go with them?
Â 
Before Shae's testimony, the case against Tyrion almost held together. It was obvious horse shit but as long as you look at each piece in isolation it worked. Tyrion DID have the poisons that were used to kill Joffrey. He DID threaten and insult Joffrey and his mother on several occasions. But when you put them all together it highlights how the whole thing makes absolutely zero sense.


It doesn't matter in that kangaroo court as far as the nobles and lords that kiss Lannister ass are concerned Tyrion did it. You could spew the biggest horse shit around that any actual man justice would see as horseshit in king landing and it will be truth why cause justice has no meaning in that place so yeah if sansa is painted as the evil master mind then she is the evil master mind. As tyrion said in one of trailers if want justice youre in the wrong place

Â 
the flaw in your logic is that you assume everyone is aware of what an idiot Sansa is...not necessarily true, she's had very limited exposure...
Â 
Cersei's way to build up the case was very original actually -Â 
Â 
1) prove he hated jofferey - Trant
2) prove his manner of death and that he had access to the poisons - Pycelle
3) prove he openly threatened him - Varys
4) prove he had a strong motive on top of hatred, revenge - Cersei
5) proof of further motivation on top of hatred and revenge, to win his wife's affection - Shae
Â 
showing multiple motives, each stronger than the last...some might believe hate, but hate really strong enough to kill a King? others might believe revenge, but is that really enough to kill a king so publicly? when you add Sansa element in and the way Shae phrased it that Sansa wouldnt let Tyrion in his bed, so he promised to kill Jofferey for her....99% of people would fall in to 1 of those 3 and hence gets everyone convinced...Â
1705	Mr Fixit	2014-05-14	For everyone who keeps saying he 'over acted' the part - I don't think you've really ever seen someone come unglued and start ranting and raving in a true fit of rage. It looks pretty ridiculous and over-dramatic. Trust me.


Â 
As someone who witnessed something similar, I have to agree. There's nothing remotely normal and expected in the behaviour of a person who's truly enraged or close to complete emotional breakdown. I was once present when such an outburst occurred (I knew the person very well) and it was terrifying, disconcerting, and totally out of this world. I've never seen anything like it before or since, thank God. I started fearing that the person in question lost his mind right then and there.
Â 
Tyrion was pretty restrained in comparison. Peter Dinklage's tour de force, no question about it.

A few have now said they know what I'm talking about. I don't think it's easily something you forget. Especially when it's uncharacteristic of the person doing it. You do fear they've lost their mind - it's powerful and animalistic.

This could be a perfect theme song for Tyrion - Monster or "Animal" - we all become what our base instincts drive us to ... Â (an old favorite of mine - ironically by Miike Snow - eh? Â   )

1709	Jasta11	2014-05-14	I rewatched it, and I can now say with confidence this was one of the bits that work even better in he show than in the books.
Â 
The addition of Jaime pleading for Tyrion's life was a great one, as was the ''trap'' that Tywin seemed to have laid out for him. It was very well thought. And his smug sipping of his wine afterwards says it all; the Lord of Casterly Rock has it all figured out. Cercei is starting to be less idotic per last episode, the Tyrells are well in hand, he has a pliable King on the throne, and now in a single stroke he secures Jaime as his heir and sends Tyrion out of sight and out of mind to the Wall while avoiding the whole kinslaying business. A masterstroke to be sure...
Â 
...That he completely ruins himself by bringing in Shae to twist the knife for no reason whatsoever, thus making Tyrion rage his life at everyone and crash the plan down by demanding trial by combat. The Imp had seemingly agreed to the Watch, he was going to plead for mercy. But now things will get even worse when Oberyn volunteers, creating a lose-lose situation, and of course ultimately the downfall of Tywin himself.
Â 
All for one last chance to hurt Tyrion. How very, very Tywin-esque. Bravo to the writers here.
Â 
Â 
Also, I have seen two people break down in anger, and trust me it's not pretty at all. Tyrion was actually fairly restrained and believable. You don't care one bit about looking good when years of abuse and lies and mistreatment blow up your restraints all at once. It was a great bit of acting.
1710	Mad Monkey	2014-05-14	Was Shae really Tywin's fault though. In both the books and the show I believe it is said that Cersei is the one who assembles the witnesses against Tyrion (Podrick refers to the witnesses -- Varys, etc. -- as "witnesses for the Queen").

Â 
showing multiple motives, each stronger than the last...some might believe hate, but hate really strong enough to kill a King?


Â 
Â 
Indeed, Cersei has been very cunning in her approach to Tyrion's trial, to use layer after layer of ways to insure his death is the end result. She knows Tyrion is very clever, and wants to insure he has no possible way out.
Â 
Part A - The Trial - As you describe above, she carefully builds a case that he was motivated to do it, based on his past actions and words, and finally on some well-placed lies. (I suppose the difference from the books was that Balon Swann was left out and also the part where someone [Tanda Stokeworth ?] swears they saw him put something in the drink.) Cersei's objective is not only to convince the judges of his guilt, but also to destroy Tyrion's reputation by building a case that he was an envious and spiteful menace, not the loyal and brave lion who charged out of the Mud gate when all hope was lost and helped save King's Landing from Stannis.Â 
Â 
Part B - Influence the judges. The trial is basically a corrupt show-trial anyway, and the judges are not really needing to be convinced of anything related to guilt or innocence. It is medieval and arbitrary and above all political. If they want him to be guilty, he will be. Cersei just has to convince them that it's in their interest. For the Tyrells, the offer is her acquiescence to a new royal marriage, thus the alliance continues and aids the furtherance of their power. For Tywin, he needs to be convinced that Tyrion should be punished for his kinslaying and regicide (because previous policy was that no Lannister could be punished for anything ever); she must convince Tywin that Tyrion is a curse to their family's fortunes and that his execution is necessary. (And unwittingly, Jaime's offer of his own might have actually removed the last restraint, loss of his only male heir, that Tywin had about finding Tyrion guilty.) Lastly we have the wild-card judge: Oberyn Martell. Oberyn is still obviously angered about Elia's death, and so Cersei tries pulling on his heartstrings about having a family member die, and the need to avenge them. She wants him to consider Joffrey as being more her son than Tywin's grandson, to feel her pain. (So to the Tyrells, she is willing to write off Joffrey for his vile acts which led to his inevitable death, but to the Martells, she acts as if he was her precious little boy whose death devastated her.)
Â 
Part C - Oh, there is a part C to this, believe me. Trial by combat ? She's familiar with the concept. Heh.

Â 
Â 
well said! but i dont think Cersei took Trial by Combat in to her consideration during the original scheming...the case was built up to have only one possible outcome...
Â 
"OFF WITH HIS HEAD!!"Â 
Â 
I loved that all the scheming Cersei did, you can see her smile right when Shae puts the final nail on his coffin, and Tywin did, finding a solution to remove Tyrion's stain on the Lannister name by sending him to the Wall and maneuvering Jaime to leave the Kingsguard....Tyrion just fucked up everyone's schemes by demanding a Trial by Combat...was amazing direction to see Cersei's smirk gone and obviously trying to come up with a new plan...Jaime's total 'WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU MAN!?" and Tywin at the end raging at losing Jaime and being forced in to a position he cannot get the most benefit out off....

Â 
Haha that was awesome! I remember seeing that bit of out-take in one of the interviews where Peter says he and Nicolaj decided to have a bit of fun with their entrance to the court room and that while some of the extras were laughing, the main cast stayed poker straight faced and then the director said something like "cut - ok lets take it from the top again..." completely deadpan. I guess by that time everyone was tired and just wanted to get the scene over with heh.
1716	Cubarey	2014-05-15	I missed the "My Lion Of Lannister" line from TV Shae. I think it would have cemented Tyrian's reaction. From interviews the Shae actress says that Cersi did tell her testify or die, but t got the feeling that the actual content of the testimony was all Shae.

Â 
That cracked me up. 


Â 
Â 
...me, too...Â
1718	rocksniffer	2014-05-15	Even though I kind of lean toward agreeing with the "angry outburst" theory, "calculated outburst" also makes sense. Â 
Â 
Things were clearly going due south for Tyrion at the trial. Â He had to change the rules of the game somehow. Â Obviously, asking for trial by combat was one way, but perhaps an emotional outburst could shake things up, too. Â After all, anybody with a brain could see that there was a great deal of truth in Tyrion's words, and perhaps they would be more inclined to actually take action if his message was delivered as strongly as possible. Â Perhaps the subtext was "screw you if you're against me, but if you're on the fence let me put my case out there as strongly as I can and maybe I'll roust up some help somewhere."
Â 
Like, for example . . . from the Viper. Â And they showed his face after Tyrion's rant. Â He looked like a man who had just seen a possibility.


Â 

i agree this could have been uncontrolled rage or a completely logical way be able to speak unimpeded...

Â 


Â 
Good points. I agree the effect was perfect especially as a lead-in for Oberyn who has been playing bored yet carefully paying attention and asking pointed questions of all the witnesses. In fact, of the three judges, Oberyn's been the only one to really ask any questions that made obvious sense in relation to uncovering possible lies or misinformation. Mace Tyrell is a complete moron and Tywin's toady so of course he doesn't contribute anything worthwhile and Tywin's carefully manipulating his own agenda.Â 
Â 
Tyrion's emotional outburst was mostly him just losing his cool. Minutes before he had agreed to do as Jaime asked him to do and said he trusted him. Enter Shae stage left and all composure and the "Plan" goes to hell. I'm not sure asking for trial by combat was a calculated thing on his part or not - it's definitely not the smartest move he could have made but as someone replied to me earlier - one of Tyrion's flaws has always been his inability to keep his mouth shut when there's something needing to be said even when it costs him points. I love him for that - no matter how smart he is he shoots himself in the foot and that's why so much of the 'evidence' against him is damning - because of his own mouth running away from him.


Â 
i suspect that is because he has a definite agenda that is apart from the main one of the rest of the court...He wants to fight and needs a really good reason, since the only reason the Mountain will show is to champion Cersei...
Â 
Â 


Â 
This. I think most people on this forum overestimate the amount of attention that Unsullied play to peripheral material.


Â 
i couldn't agree more...we all think that everyone is doing the research into every little burp and fart, but my Unsullied buddies at our pub don't know or care about the back story they are in it for the thrill of this show...perhaps when it is all said and done they will take my advice and read...those that can...to find out what really happened...
Â 
Â 


I don't think Tyrion has really shown his claws and been as absolutely VENOMOUS as he was this episode. This bitterness of his is an important part of his character and he delivered that speech to perfection.Â 


Â 
this is so true, Theda...i have been waiting for him to do this very thing...Â 
Â 
Â 


Â 
Aww thanks! It's nice to be appreciated in these debates as I've had to withdraw the claws in a few heated ones where people have disagreed and I'm a lot like Tyrion in that I should keep my mouth shut as an intelligent person but I tend to just say what I feel too often and it gets me in trouble.  At least I won't lose my head for it haha.
Â 
Tyrion's 'armor' line he gave to Jon Snow which I previously quoted is one of my all time favorite lines in the enitre book / series. In fact I think I'll change it to my signature quote. It's a creed to live by even in our real world for many of us who are 'imperfect' and know full well what it's like to be tormented for who you are.

i agree completely...everyone i've spoken commented on how they truly felt the venom and loathing and hurt in his speech...true perfectionÂ 
Â 
some of my unsullied no longer believe that Peter Dinklage doesn't read the books, they feel it was impossible to deliver that powerful performance without reading the books....i have one answer...Yes, he's just that goodÂ  it was the first inkling I got that he will be just as capable of handling all the nasty depressed destructive stuff that is to come.
1720	Inv1ctus	2014-05-15	I was thinking to myself if Peter kind of channeled some of his own emotions in that scene. He was probably ridiculed as a kid for being a dwarf, just the world we live in. Because I really felt all those emotions and I'm really baffled that some people are saying he overacted. To me it wasn't even close to overacting.

Â 
Right - Oberyn's the only wild card in the picture. He's got another agenda in mind which is why it was risky for Tywin to make him one of the judges. I think he did that to try and make him (and thus House Martell) fall more in line with the royal throne and appear 'allies' - if he pretends to trust Oberyn with judgement and sitting on the small council then maybe Oberyn won't go ape shit and try to kill anyone (wishful thinking). It's a tricky situation for Tywin and it backfires on him with the trial by combat outcome.
Â 
... You're welcome. We monsters must stick together.
1724	Hodor's Dragon	2014-05-15	Tyrion never forgets he's a dwarf, and he's not shy about mentioning the ways that it changes things. Â I'll bet that's one of the things that attracted Dinklage to the role. Â (Of course, it's the best dwarf role, like, ever, and that may have played a small factor in making him want to take it, too. . . .)

One thing I liked about this season is that we get to see how Tywin would have smoothed things over with the Martells. It's hard to really come back from orchestrating the rape and murder of the prince's sister and her children, but Tywin was smart to go to Oberyn and treat him with courtesy and respect. He doesn't ask Oberyn to be his BFF -- that would be overselling it and Oberyn would recoil. Instead, he acknowledges that Oberyn's anger is justified and offers him some measure of justice. It's very pragmatic and believable. I don't think Oberyn buys it, of course, but he could.

Â 
I see it as playing politics. Â Oberyn will never be satisfied with the crumbs from Tywin's table, but when he inevitably does his revenge thing the story will be that the Lannisters made a reasonable offer and the Martells rejected it and lashed out instead. Â

Â 
No, Oberyn doesn't buy it for a minute. He's only accepted so he can bide his time and find a way to get revenge for his sister. Little does he know just how soon that opportunity comes knocking....
1728	Cubarey	2014-05-15	"i agree this could have been uncontrolled rage or a completely logical way be able to speak unimpeded..."
Â 
Except that by merely speaking he is screwing his best chance of survival. Remember he knows that his father and the Martell's will find him guilty. He explodes spews his venom and then realizes that he just convicted himself. At that point he does not expect beryn to champion him he probably hopes Brone will but its a desperate gambit not a rationale thought out plan. Â  b Â Â
1729	Lord Damian	2014-05-16	Sad thing is this, Tyrion, though he tries, knows that his best chance is trial by combat. on the show, it is all he has because he knows what happened to Ned when he Confessed to save his daughter's life, the crown can do what they please with you and they killed Ned. Ned did not ask for a trial. Tyrion was not about to make that mistake.

Â 
And going to the Wall, here at the very end of the longest summer in memory, with the Others massing, the wildlings poised to invade - and remember, Tyrion is a Lannister and was recently Hand, he has some knowledge of these developments - no women, no good wine, a military life surrounded by criminals and rejects . . . not exactly an inviting prospect for a guy like Tyrion.

Â 
well said! but i dont think Cersei took Trial by Combat in to her consideration during the original scheming...the case was built up to have only one possible outcome...
Â 
"OFF WITH HIS HEAD!!"Â 
Â 
I loved that all the scheming Cersei did, you can see her smile right when Shae puts the final nail on his coffin, and Tywin did, finding a solution to remove Tyrion's stain on the Lannister name by sending him to the Wall and maneuvering Jaime to leave the Kingsguard....Tyrion just fucked up everyone's schemes by demanding a Trial by Combat...was amazing direction to see Cersei's smirk gone and obviously trying to come up with a new plan...Jaime's total 'WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU MAN!?" and Tywin at the end raging at losing Jaime and being forced in to a position he cannot get the most benefit out off....


Â 
The reaction shots are great, cut to Jaime who starts and then looks down at were his missing hand would be, pan to Cersei sitting up rigid, and yep, she flexes the fingers onÂ herÂ right hand...
1732	darksellsword	2014-05-16	Regarding the necklace, wasn't it littlefingers plan to leave it on Ser dontos body to put Tyrion in hot water by implicating Sansa
He wants Tyrion dead so Sansa is free to remarry?. Tv Shae's motivations are entirely believable in my opinion. She has been
rejected in the most cruel way from her point of view and Sansa was the reason Tyrion rejected her and the love she thought they had for each other,
lets not forget that hell hath no fury like a woman scorned , jealousy is a very corrupting emotion.
You have to take into account that for all Shae knows Sansa did kill Joffrey and left her there to be tortured or who knows what.
It is also plausible that after she believes it is all over with Tyrion that she goes back to what she knows which is being a whore.
I don't imagine there was a lot of coercion from Tywin or Cersei in her testimony. Shae wasn't afraid of anybody. When we were first introduced to her character she was in a battle camp and in the blackwater episode she had a dagger strapped to her thigh and was more than willing to fight any man .
I think its far more likely that Shae was a very willing witness although well prepared by Cersei or Tywin.

Â 
This. Even if Tyrion had enough faith in "justice" to think that the crown would honor the deal and send him to the Wall - the Wall is no place for a dwarf, and it certainly isn't a place for a Lannister when a bastard son of house Stark is there.

checked this again...was truly beautiful to watchÂ
1735	Rudra's Eyes	2014-05-25	I was disappointed in e07 when Bronn and Tyrion have that conversation and somehow Shae doesn't come up at all! IIRC Bronn never explicitly confirmed that he put her on the boat and watched the boat sail away. All he says his "she's gone". So surely that would be the first question Tyrion would ask "what's the deal with Shae being in King's Landing?".
Â 
So did she go to Pentos and then the Lannisters tracked her down over there? Or has she been in King's Landing / Westeros the whole time?
1736	Mad Monkey	2014-05-25	It's probably one of those temporal snapbacks, caused when book continuity forcibly imposes itself over show continuity and smooths out divergences. In the books, Tyrion never sends Shae away at all, which makes it possible for Cersei to reach her. In the show, Tyrion sends Shae away to the Free Cities yet she suddenly and abruptly appears back in KL. It was probably very scary for her too, suddenly being yanked back through time and space back to where she started. I wonder if she even made it off the ship before continuity snapped back.

1737	Talking Hodor	2014-06-04	Humiliating and seeking revenge on Tyrion for rejecting her is one thing, but throwing Sansa, the girl she once said she would kill for, under the bus as well? Not cool (assuming no coercion).


Sansa's fair game.Â  She's vacated the premeses, never to return.Â  I'm sure she'd give a rat's ass that her handmaiden was badmouthing her in order to save her skin.

Tyrion would make an excellent steward/maester.Â  Jon liked Tyrion, probably would like him more after finding out he "killed" Joffrey and hearing an explanation from him about his family's (not his) misdeeds.Â  I'm sure he would have been fine at the wall.
1739	Odon	2014-06-17	I just loved how Tyrion called Joffrey a bastard in front of the entire court, after the Lannisters have all been tiptoeing around the subject of his illegitimacy.

Â 
ROFL!Â   But I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t think Shae ever got out of the harbour.Â  Maybe she was detained on the ship, or bribed the captain to row her back to shore, or Bronn just sold her directly to Cersei (I would be disappointed if this happened but itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a possibility.Â  I guess weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll see in upcoming episodes).
Â 
I really didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t think it strange that sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>d implicate Sansa.Â  Tywin is taking a Â â<U+0080>clean handsâ<U+0080><U+0099> approach (as he did with the Red Wedding) to the whole trial, putting on this Â show of â<U+0080>I canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t get involvedâ<U+0080><U+0099> objectivity (which he claims to Cersei in a previous episode and Jaime in this one) while manipulating events to his desired outcome.Â  Cersei is the one actually bribing and threatening witnesses, hence her desire to implicate Sansa whom she holds fully responsible for her â<U+0080>treacherousâ<U+0080><U+0099> actions.Â  Shae wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t be happy about it, but Cersei would make it clear she canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t implicate Tyrion without Sansa.Â  And remember Sansa has got away successfully; I think Shae wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have gone through with it if Sansa was in the dock with Tyrion.Â  This explains why Cersei tenses up when Shae enters, but relaxes when Shae follows the script.
Â 
As for Shaeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s dress, itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not meant as payment (though Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m sure a carrot and stick approach was used to coerce her) but to portray a certain image.Â  Tyrion is brought into the courtroom in shackles and chained to the dock like a wild beast, even though the idea of a dwarf overpowering his guards and fleeing on his little legs is ridiculous.Â  Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s just meant to make him look like a dangerous criminal.Â  Likewise Shae is dressed the way she is to make her look more innocent, to emphasise her story about being a girl forced into being a sex slave by the lecherous, amoral dwarf.

1740	Debb2	2014-05-12	I thought this was a very good scene, pushing Stannis' storyline forward (at last). It also reminded us what a good, loyal man Davos is (and I love his West Yorkshire accent).
Â 
Did anyone else think that the room looked more modern than other architecture we have seen? Instead of looking Classical or Medieval I thought it look more Renaissance. I wonder if this was deliberate.
Â 
And of course, as the title suggests, I thought that Mark Gatiss played a good part.
1741	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-13	"This is a local bank, for local people! There's nothing for you here!''
Â 
My only criticisms are because they have (D & D) don't quite understand Stannis' character and haven't really made him very likable at all, Davos' adoration doesn't play quite as well because it seems far fetched that he'd love the Stannis D & D have created.
1742	direwoofwoof	2014-05-13	The architecure of the Iron Bank was modern and spare, but also authoritative and imposing. I liked the look with the huge doors, table, and smaller seats for "customers..." you know, the ones Stannis refused to sit upon! The lack of color and frills paid homage to the seriousness of the business transactions that occur in that room. The banker guy was rather cocky and Davos was great, of course.
1743	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-13	So glad they hired Mark Gatiss.

1745	Mad Monkey	2014-05-13	I do wish they had retained Lord Tycho's polite and amiable personality from the books though. I did like the gentle teasing ("four thousand men? thirty-two ships??") but his overall smugness reminded me too much of an identical scene from season two when Dany was begging for a loan from the Spicers. The Spice merchants asked her the same question ("how many men have you got??") It also would have been nice if Stannis were given more useful role. This scene would have worked even if Stannis weren't present since all he does is sit there and whine about how "all of your money is MINE BY RIGHTS!!"

Their Stannis just doesn't work, it's one of my biggest problems with the show. Davos is so perfect but even he doesn't quite work because he worships someone that just isn't likable in the show AT ALL. He hardly said ANYTHING in this scene and what he did say was whiny and entitled and just...I'm not interested with show Stannis at all and that's NOT the sort of thing I should be feeling forwards a character I'm quite invested in in the books.
1747	boojam	2014-05-27	So glad they hired Mark Gatiss.Anybody ever find out why he did not introduce himself as Tycho Nestoris ?Sometimes D&D seems to forget names, like the dragons!
1748	Pericles	2014-05-13	I was watching E6 (again) and it struck me that Tycho Nestoris refuses to be called Lord. As a student of history, and of the Ancient and Medieval City States, this interests me. Is this evidence that Braavos is more socially and politically equal then the Seven Kingdoms?Â 
Â 
I say this because GOT is an expy of Medieval Europe, and there were several non-feudal/republican societies in existence at the time; the Old Swiss Confederacy, the Maritime Republics of Italy, etc.Â
1749	Catastrophe	2014-05-14	The nineÂ Free Cities are based on the city-states of Medieval Italy.Â They're the last remnants of the ancient Valyrian Freehold, which is an analogue to the real-world Roman Republic/Roman Empire. They're not feudal societies like the Seven Kingdoms, they're democratic city-states with elected leaders. They also place a greater value on trade, commerce, and economic power than on military power, in contrast to the martial culture of Westeros (though Braavos has the largest navy in the world, and all nine Free Cities have mercenary armies in their service).
1750	Ravi Seaworth	2014-05-14	Slavery may be a problem, though. Not that it matters, since it is pointless judging a different society using modern standards.

					
					
							Edited by Ravi Seaworth, 14 May 2014 - 03:32 AM.
1751	Catastrophe	2014-05-14	Slavery is illegal in Braavos, though it's still a problem in some of the other Free Cities.

Can't stand that gender stuff anymore. Trianna was returned 4 times as Triarch of Volantis, so what? We don't know of any law forbidding women to run for Sealord of Braavos. Since the use of knives seems to be normal in the chosing process, Arya might stand a fair chance of being elected!

Â 
Exactly. The common people of these republican City-States are just as expendable and oppressed as their Westorosi brethren. They just serveÂ a wealth based aristocracy instead of a land based one. They also have slaves to look upon with pity or scorn. Historically, slavery has been a deterrent to unrest among the lower class freemen.Â Â

Male priority seems to be the rule, so it should be Bran, Rickon, (Benjen, but he's NW), Sansa and Arya. In Dorne, it's pure seniority, Arianne is the heiress, not Quentin. May be the female succession of Dorne is a remnant of Nymeria's conquest.

1762	Fantasy Character	2014-05-16	My friend asked me yesterday where I'd want to live and from the viewpoint of a woman of color, I answered Dorne (primogeniture, more lax attitude toward sexuality for women) or Braavos (no slaves, and we see some women in positions of power). Both have a history of independence/resistance to being conquered, which indicates a decent chance of a stable life.
Â 
Also, Braavos and its constant fog reminds me a little of San Francisco. 
Â 
A lot of the other Free Cities trade in or practice slavery. Lys is famed for its pleasure slaves, Volantis has The Widow of the Waterfront illustrating that only freeborn people can live within walls and she had to get the tear tattoos cut off, Pentos doesn't have slavery but the servants under Illyrio don't appear to have many rights, etc.
1763	Banner Without Brothers	2014-05-16	Isn't there something about having the blood of old Valeria as a requirement for standing for election in the free cities?
Â 
As for women surely Dorne should be a prime contender. But also what about the wildlings and the hill tribesman of the vale? Chella daughter of..... I forget was chief of the..... black ears (iirc). When we first meet them in the book Tyrion is aghast that all of the tribe get to have a say in the tribes decisions, "even the women!". Succession is also based on merit from what I gather. With the burned men deciding succession on who can achieve the greatest self mutilation.
Â 
For me I think the hill tribesmen definitely deserve to be in for a shout of most equal society. Apologies if I've messed up the names of the clans.
1764	Catastrophe	2014-05-16	Exactly. The common people of these republican City-States are just as expendable and oppressed as their Westorosi brethren. They just serveÂ a wealth based aristocracy instead of a land based one. They also have slaves to look upon with pity or scorn. Historically, slavery has been a deterrent to unrest among the lower class freemen.Â Â I wouldn't say it's exactly the same, since wealth-based societies at least allow for some degree of social mobility. In the mercantilist city states, a poor person could potentially gain power if he became rich enough. In the feudal kingdoms of Westeros, a lowborn merchant who becomes rich is still considered lowborn. There's not really any way for a peasant to become a noble, except by the decree of a King or Lord Paramount. Even then, an upjumped commoner would be considered the lowest of the nobility, and wouldn't be treated with respect (see Littlefinger, Davos Seaworth, Janos Slynt, Halleyne, and so forth).That said, some of the Free Cities practice slavery, which is outlawed in Westeros (and unlike real-life medieval Europe, there are no serfs in Westeros, unless you count the Ironborn's thralls). In that regard, Westeros could be considered more egalitarian than those Free Cities. However, as I mentioned earlier, slavery is illegal in Braavos.Basically, if I was poor and lowborn, I'd much rather live in one of the Free Cities than in Westeros. However, I'd much rather be a commoner in Westeros than a slave in one of the Free Cities.

Why would women want to live in societies based upon rape?Â 


Based upon rape? That sounds a little bit of an over statement. To say that a society is based upon rape. I don't even know how that could work. But I suppose you could easily say that of the rest of westeros or even our own society if you believe the 33% of college students are victims of rape while studying. Even 50% I've read. But anyway in the hill clans at least everyone is near enough politically equal. Everyone regardless of age or gender gets to have a say in the decisions of the tribe. You could say it's more democratic than our own society in that regard. The only higher station someone can achieve is through merit. Not through birth right. Nobody owns anyone else (within the group) nor are they obliged to give others their labour. If you're looking for equality the Hill tribes win in my book. It's just a shame they have no industry to speak of forcing them into a particularly brutal lifestyle.
Â 
I'm interested to hear your definition of a society based on rape and why you think that ANY place in Westeros or Essos would be significantly better. Or would not fit your definition of a society based on rape.

Â 
Wildling culture is centered around stealing women. Stealing women to have sex with them without asking their consent. That is a society based upon rape.
Â 
The Hill Tribes also steal women. As well as being seemingly dependent upon robbing passersby. That is a culture based not solely around rape but also murder and theft.

Â 
The original poster mentioned social and political equality. If I were to take a stab at interpreting it for the mountain tribes:
Â 
They're probably more equal in terms of vote because they are a small tribe and all of them know one another. They'll clearly have leaders and people whose word carries more weight, but it's not like they have such a large population they must set up a poll system, a census, a special voting day, and so on.
Â 
We know the Triarchs of Volantis are voted for by freeborn landholders, but not by those without land or slaves, so it's not quite as nice.
Â 
In terms of wealth in the Hill Tribes, there's probably less disparity because let's face it, they don't have much. When resources are so scarce and the tribe small, you don't have as separated gender roles, because you can't afford to cloister the women and have them focus on learning to curtsy a la Cersei's pet peeve, instead of arming them to fight and teaching them to hunt/gather/work for food.
Â 
So in terms of social and political equality amongst themselves, I do think some Hill Tribes are definitely ahead of the main society of Westeros. I'd still prefer to live somewhere with plumbing and steady access to food, though. I hear the oranges in Dorne taste nice...
Â 
Edit: "Ahead" may be the wrong word choice, since the main society of Westeros is further along in terms of technology, and their societal customs arguably developed because of greater population density and scarcity of land/property.

The Iron bank funds wars and rebellions, imposes loans at usurious prices. Its probably a allusion to JP Morgan, Rothschild, and others all powerful banks nowaday.
The IB is against slavery? Fair enough. A slave dont spends money, since he earn none, so he cant asks for a credit.

And this makes them more based on rape how? Are arranged marriages less rape? Think of Tyrion and Sansa. The prospect of Arya and any Lord especially the Frey marriage that Rob agreed to. All women are forced into sexual relationships against their will. They are merely assets to their families to cement alliances. Certainly if you are just talking about Craster's little group then yes that is an entire culture built around rape. But when Osha discusses her past relationships, she states that she was very much in love and very happy with the man she was with before he died. She then says she chose to go with the group who she came south with. Not abducted but out of fear and desperation. When Ygritte discusses her past relations I don't get the impression that they were different times that she's been raped. Do you?
Â 
Yet on the other side of the wall I would say rape is even more common place. Men there are often ordered by Lords to rape peasents. As previously mentioned in the seven kingdoms women are bought and sold as commodities regardless of their wealth or position within society. I've never heard of brothels North of the wall or political marriages. So tell me again why the wildlings are so much worse than the seven Kingdoms in terms of the treatment of women.
Â 
Or just drop this incredibly depressing subject before I literally morph into Andrea Dworkin.


Beyond the Wall = Culture based on rape
Â

Â

Culture based on humans? Whut? Do slaves and women not count as humans? Surely the words you are looking for is economy and serfdom. That would make more sense. And as above unless you are specifically talking about Craster's then you're just plain wrong if you think it's any worse than anywhere else. You also can't put all wildling cultures into one box. They all have different cultures but to my knowledge none of them is primarily based on a culture of rape, which would be a prerequisite for a society to be based on rape. If anything their society is based on equality and meritocracy hence the name free folk.
Â 
Finally I'm just gonna drop this in from the site's wiki
Â 
"In marriage, the men are expected to be quite forceful with women, going so far as stealing them from their home or clan. The women, in turn, are expected to put up a fight every step of the way.[1] It is believed that a true man will steal a woman from afar to strengthen the clan. Men must steal daughters, but not wives of other men.
When the red wanderer is within the Moonmaid, it is considered a propitious time for a man to steal a woman.[7] While it may seem different from the idealized courtly love of Westeros, at its core it establishes a male's strength and determination, as well as a female's independence and ability to defend herself."
Â 
I am by no means saying that there is no rape within the free folk or that it is by any means perfect. But I'd say it's a darn sight better than being considered merely a commodity that can be bought and sold.

How many cases of truly forced weddings do we have?
Arranged is not forced. Women being commodities is a gross oversimplification. These are are daughters and sisters and nieces, most people do not want to see their daughters and sisters and nieces raped. Or wed to brutal people.
Women do not have to say their vows on their wedding day. If they do not say them, they cannot be wed. That is a recourse wildlings do not offer.
Do you not see how a society where all, not <1% of the population's, weddings involve the forcible abduction and penetration of women is based upon rape? You find this less appalling than a society where less than 1% of women have the possibility, the mere possibility, of being forcibly sold into an unwanted marriage with a brutal man?
Brothels are a business. Women sell sex. Selling sex is not rape.

All the weddings are forced some become good relationships some don't. Are you seriously saying you think women in the seven kingdoms have a choice? Just look at the relationship between Black Fish and Hoster Tully. They didn't speak for 20 years or something after his brother turned down a marriage. What do you think it would have been like if one of his daughters had said no? No coercion there I suppose?

You haven't answered any of my questions. How do you account for the two first hand accounts of wildling women? Osha and Ygritte. Do they once complain or even suggest that their previous relationships have started with rape?

No?

No, they are not. Doran does not force Arianne to marry, while thisÂ itselfÂ is a farce, it was devised specifically as a way to avoid suspicion. Logically we can infer this isn't unusual. Arranged is not forced.
Â 
Osha and Ygritte are rather lucky then. What part of forcibly abducting women to have sex doesn't imply rape to you? Do you understand rape as a concept? Forcible as a term?
Â 
No what? Use your words pal.

Nobles make up less than 1% of Westoros' population.Â Keep up.

1779	Bear Island	2014-05-18	Can't stand that gender stuff anymore. Trianna was returned 4 times as Triarch of Volantis, so what? We don't know of any law forbidding women to run for Sealord of Braavos. Since the use of knives seems to be normal in the chosing process, Arya might stand a fair chance of being elected!



Maybe you can't stand it, but the whole world has a massive issue with rape culture. So what if a female can be a Triarch, or even a queen? The point is that even women with free agency are constantly overlooked, ridiculed and threatened. Just a few examples:
Cersei: Queen regent of the seven kingdoms. Her thoughts and ideas (although they're usually terrible) are constantly dismissed and undermined by the men around her in small council, especially by her own father. She gets people to do her bidding by sexually manipulating them and has nothing else to offer, even with the privilege the wealth of Casterly Rock can provide. Her brother is a dwarf and constantly ridiculed, yet has held two actual positions of note (master of coin and hand of the king) without having to sleep around to get them.
Arianna: Older than her brother Quentyn and actually ahead of him in the line of succession. Overlooked by her father, who wants her younger brother to rule Dorne and has wanted so since she was a child. Also uses her sexuality to get what she wants out of the men around her. When she is proactive and plans to take power, she is undermined by her own friends and father.
The Sand Snakes: Some of the most highly-educated and free women in the world, they are imprisoned by their uncle for wanting to avenge their father's death, including the girls who are too little to do anything to actually organise said revenge.
Brienne: As skilled with a blade as any man, is tormented by men and has had many near misses with rape. Mentions having to basically sleep with one eye open at all times because of rapists.
Dany: Actually takes cities by force the way male conquerors of the past have, but the only way she felt able to stop the killing of her people was by giving herself over in marriage. She was not loved or respected enough or powerful enough to work out a solution to the problem on her own, even though she was advised not to marry.
Women in that world are constantly thwarted, threatened, hurt and used. That's just how it is. I personally cannot take gender out of the equation when I look at the issue of equality in asoiaf. It's not the most important issue, or the biggest, but it's still very much there. As a woman, I would not want to live anywhere in that world. Those are just my feelings on the matter. Westeros isn't a society built upon rape per se (imo), but it's an EXTREMELY patriarchal society where men and women are not equal even when a woman is a ruler with power, and rape is fact of life there. All most women have to offer is their bodies, no matter how high born they are, which is always true in aggressively patriarchal societies.
Whenever women are seen as not having agency over their lives or bodies, rape abounds.

1780	Ser Lepus	2014-05-18	Braavos hasn't a division between nobles and commoners, and doesn't have slaves. All Braavosi are citizens (however, they probably have non-citizen foreign residents with less rights than "true" Braavosi).
Â 
What they do have is a division by wealth. We don't know how oppresed are the poor people, or if they are oppresed at all, and we don't know how easy is to make the jump from poverty to wealth, or if the Oligarchy would allow a new rich to join them.
Â 
We also don't know how they choose their rulers. We know that the Sealord rules for life, that he has a lot of power (everybody speaks as if the Sealord were the only relevant politician in Braavos) and that there are elections when the Sealord dies. However, it seems that people kill each other on the streets during those elections, and that the city nearly goes into civil war every time they have to choose a new Sealord.
Â 
Also, we don't know if all citizens have the right to vote, or only the rich ones (which was very common in our own world), if they make direct elections or have some kind of Parlament that votes the Sealord. And if that Parlament exists, we don't know if all the votes count the same for the purpose of choosing representatives (in our own world it was quite usual to have a fixed number of seats in the Assembly for each social class or even to have separate Assemblies for different social classes, so the votes of the rich people were worth more).
Â 
And most important of all, we don't know if anybody can be Sealord or if he has to belong to certain families or have a certain level of wealth.

Arianne is not being plotted against by her father. That is a misconception on her part.
The Sand Snakes aren't implied to be well educated. They're imprisoned because they're spreading dissent throughout Dorne. The younger ones are simply sent to the Water Gardens. They're not the only people imprisoned for this either.
I agree with the broad strokes of your post but you're mistaken on a few points here.

1790	avernite	2014-05-18	Maybe you can't stand it, but the whole world has a massive issue with rape culture. So what if a female can be a Triarch, or even a queen? The point is that even women with free agency are constantly overlooked, ridiculed and threatened. Just a few examples:
Cersei: Queen regent of the seven kingdoms. Her thoughts and ideas (although they're usually terrible) are constantly dismissed and undermined by the men around her in small council, especially by her own father. She gets people to do her bidding by sexually manipulating them and has nothing else to offer, even with the privilege the wealth of Casterly Rock can provide. Her brother is a dwarf and constantly ridiculed, yet has held two actual positions of note (master of coin and hand of the king) without having to sleep around to get them.
Arianna: Older than her brother Quentyn and actually ahead of him in the line of succession. Overlooked by her father, who wants her younger brother to rule Dorne and has wanted so since she was a child. Also uses her sexuality to get what she wants out of the men around her. When she is proactive and plans to take power, she is undermined by her own friends and father.
The Sand Snakes: Some of the most highly-educated and free women in the world, they are imprisoned by their uncle for wanting to avenge their father's death, including the girls who are too little to do anything to actually organise said revenge.
Brienne: As skilled with a blade as any man, is tormented by men and has had many near misses with rape. Mentions having to basically sleep with one eye open at all times because of rapists.
Dany: Actually takes cities by force the way male conquerors of the past have, but the only way she felt able to stop the killing of her people was by giving herself over in marriage. She was not loved or respected enough or powerful enough to work out a solution to the problem on her own, even though she was advised not to marry.
Women in that world are constantly thwarted, threatened, hurt and used. That's just how it is. I personally cannot take gender out of the equation when I look at the issue of equality in asoiaf. It's not the most important issue, or the biggest, but it's still very much there. As a woman, I would not want to live anywhere in that world. Those are just my feelings on the matter. Westeros isn't a society built upon rape per se (imo), but it's an EXTREMELY patriarchal society where men and women are not equal even when a woman is a ruler with power, and rape is fact of life there. All most women have to offer is their bodies, no matter how high born they are, which is always true in aggressively patriarchal societies.
Whenever women are seen as not having agency over their lives or bodies, rape abounds.


Â 
Cersei: She, it should be noted, fails miserably prior to all the problems you explain. She is seen as bad for having failed to stop Joffrey from killing Eddard - implying she could do so. As a woman. To a king. She's his mother, granted, but it clearly shows she's seen as having agency. She just fails at it, which is what all subsequent events keep showing. That, in addition, she uses sex as a weapon proves what? That she has control over her sexuality, and she can give or deny it to people and gain power that way? How is that not control?
Â 
Arianne: Well, yeah, you obviously didn't read the books all the way - she was supposed to get the higher honour than her brother. Also, same as above, she's the one using her sexuality as a control tool, and in her case it's even clear the man is the one who shouldn't be allowed to do what he does, and would be punished for it. Not her.
Â 
The Sand Snakes: these women are treated as a clear threat to the position of a man, the Prince of Dorne. Threatened by women. Bastard-born women, even. He wins the struggle, but he clearly thinks there's an actual contest if he doesn't act. How does this show them as powerless, rather than as serious players that need to be countered?
Â 
Brienne: I can't argue with that one. But then, she kills people too, not sure if that's so great.
Â 
Dany: The way Aegon the bloody conqueror took the seven kingdoms and made his peace was by not changing anything, just adding a loose layer on top of the pyramid of power. Dany does something completely different, and has to solve it completely differently. How does that prove anything?
Â 
People in this world are constantly threatened, hurt and used. As a man, I wouldn't want to live in the horrid world that is aSoIaF, either - maybe you get handed a stick and forced to fight another lord, rather than get raped. Neither seems appealing, really. Women have power, as Cersei shows, as Arianne shows, as Dany shows. They have enough control over their bodies to choose where and when to have sex - and to use it to their advantage, too. Cersei is threatened with a new forced marriage, aye, and Sansa is forced to marry outright - but Tyrion didn't have much of a choice in who HE wanted to marry, either (meaning Tysha, here).
1791	Fat Trell	2014-05-18	Its not. 
Alys Karstark explains how succession works when she tells Jon about how her great uncle is atempting to usurp her claim to Karhold by marrying her off to his son.
Arianne explains how Dornish succession works when she lays out her plan to crown Myrcella to Arys.

1793	idler	2014-05-22	I was watching E6 (again) and it struck me that Tycho Nestoris refuses to be called Lord. As a student of history, and of the Ancient and Medieval City States, this interests me. Is this evidence that Braavos is more socially and politically equal then the Seven Kingdoms?


The books make it quite clear.

	Spoiler The Blind Girl: "The Foghouse was always crowded with polemen off the serpent boats, arguing about gods and courtesans and wether or not the Sealord was a fool."
Â 
Mercedene:"...Mercy preferred the scene where the fat merchant shat on the Sealords head as he passed underneath in his gold-and-purple barge. Only in Braavos could something like that happen, it was said, and only in Braavos would Sealord and sailor alike howl with laughter to see it."
Â 
From The Black Pearl to the beggar in Ragman's Harbor, Braavosi despise slavery and Valyrian dragons. A considerable part of the male population wears rapiers like "Needle" (well, not at night, not to be challenged by the bravos); even a young Cat might be armed with several knives, no questions asked

I daresay if there is any Free City, it's Braavos.
1794	Mrs_Darcy	2014-05-12	I was really surprised, when I saw the episode, that they had not changed Shae's testimony and her reasons for doing it , since they had made her a lot nicer, than in the books.
I think it will be very hard for show-viewers only to accept, that show-Shae, who genuinely loved Tyrion and who stayed even when offered a good amount of gold for leaving him and going to Essos basically sold Tyrion out.
Â 
I saw the HBO videos accompanying this episode (Inside the episode, etc. ) and they made it clear, that Shae had been somehow coerced into it by Cersei. But why did we never see this? It would have cost 2 minutes maximum in either this episode on in the last to have a scene, in which Cersei threatens Shae with torture etc. if she does not tell lies about Tyrion in the trial.
Â 
Likewise, I found it really odd, that show-Shae was willing to implicate Sansa in the murder of Joffrey, since she was quite fond of her in the show and even tried to hide the fact, that she had flowered. ( In the books was quite greedy and I therefore was not surprised, when she spoke against her especially as we later hear that Cersei had promised her a manse).
Additionally, I found it quite odd, that Shae gave her testimony wearing one of Sansa's dresses, since it made her look greedy, which is in contrast to the Shae HBO had portrayed before.
Â 
A lot of book-readers have speculated, that Shae would somehow implicate Tyrion, because she tries to save Sansa, which is also what I had assumed would happen.
Â 
What do you think about this choice in the adaption?
1795	Seneti	2014-05-13	Personally, I am very happy that they kept her testimony as it was (essentially, minor adjustment for changes of dialogue etc.). The part where she framed and humiliated Tyrion did not surprise me at all. Not only is show Shae at this point very frustrated and hurt because of how Tyrion treated her during season 3 (hell hath no fury like a woman scorned), but the nervous looks she gave make me believe that she was, at least in part, coerced into testifying. Giving her Sansa's wardrobe was probably part of the "reward". We do know for a fact that Tywin had ordered to have her brought to the Tower of the Hand, so there's where it might have happened. I agree, though, that a minute or two explaining what exactly happened might be a good idea.
Â 
As for her testimony against Sansa: I have no idea how they are going to explain that (if at all). That's about the only gripe I had with the trial in the show.
1796	Yojimbo	2014-05-13	As I said here (#15), Tyrion won't kill Shae, she will be Tywins "Where do whores go?" line is directed at.

Â 
Well I do give my reason in that thread.....as I said.....but if as you say "Game of Thrones is only a success because they have sudden deaths of likable characters." Then I would be pretty certain they really could be called out on not giving a shit at all about the books and start nocking off charaecter when they felt like and by your logic it would be the "best show ever!" right?

I read somewhere, that even the actress playing Shae Sibel Kekilli wanted to have the part of her testimony removed, where she blamed Sansa.
1802	Woman of War	2014-05-13	Yes, it is hard to explain why Shae suddenly turned against Sansa in such a vicious way. I could, if I have to, come up with the explanation that Sansa has all Shae wanted, at least in Shae's eyes: the status and future as Tyrion's wife, and that It was because of Sansa that Tyrion did not want Shae anymore. 
But I think there is a very valid narrative reason for emphazising Sansa's alleged guilt over and over again: Sansa has to be in real danger if she gets caught, has to be a hunted fugitive, notorious in all of Westeros, totally dependent of Baelish. And maybe, if Robert Arryn dies mysteriously, her having been part of another poisoning will be warmed up by her persecutors. She might have some moral credibility left if she poisoned the evil king but even Northern lords might not protect her if she is suspected to have poisoned young Lord Arryn.

Â 
Well you managed to give a reasonable explanation on why TV Shae turned against Tyrion. Sansa has the name, the looks and a possible bright future ahead of her and Shae is nobody. She's just a whore from Lorath with only one name (as Varys made sure she remembers). Besides that, Tyrion started to reject her because of his marriage to Sansa and sent her away. That made Shae feel betrayed because in the TV show she seemed to genuinely love Tyrion so she decided to hurt him just as he (in her mind) hurt her by treating her as worthless whore.
Â 
Personally, I like TV Shae because the changes they made to her character will make her death more shocking for our unsullied friends.

I don't think there is any way Tyrion's actions will be different than in the books. He even called her a lying whore in the show.
Bye Shae.
1805	RedShirt47	2014-05-13	They couldn't have had a Cersei forcing Shae to testify scene before the trial as it would have ruined the surprise of her appearance at the end.
They might have a scene next week where Cersei says Well done, we won't slit your throat and feed you to fish in Blackwater bay".
Â 
I was very glad they had her in the trial, I feared they might not. I think she will die in ep 10 (Hope so). Shae of season 3 / 4 has been mostly whining and nagging and not so nice. I think this is preparing the audience for her death.
1806	King Tyrion I	2014-05-13	Shae came with Tyrion to KL.
Â 
He repeatedly told her that KL was a dangerous place, because he knew in the back of his mind Tywin's threat to hang the next whore he'd find in Tyrion's bed.
Â 
Tyrion found a way for her to serve, to go unnoticed as Sansa's handmaiden. Shae really served Tyrion, because she was the woman he still went to bed with - and she had his warnings. Several times.
Â 
Varys tried to get her away from Tyrion - after his marriage. Tyrion himself tries to get rid of her. Because he's a Lannister and he knows his father makes no idle threats at all. Tywin is rather consequent in his actions.
Â 
I don't think that Tyrion got Tywin's "I'll have her brought to the Tower of the Hand". He wanted to send her away and that's why he hurt her - we can see her crying. He wanted to send her away so she could have a life worth living. But do we know for certain these weren't but crocodile tears of a woman who is a whore?
Â 
Shae knows about Tysha. Tyrion himself told her about that part of his life. And she most definitely knows that Tysha is still a very important issue in Tyrion's life, Tysha is Tyrion's Achilles' heel.
Â 
Maybe she hoped to get a better life after all - with a Lord at her side. And Tyrion fits that. He's a Lord, he's got a powerful name, he's got the money, he's a Lannister after all.
Â 
Surely, we can also see that she was forced to commit prejury. She has nothing to lose, just to gain from the trial and its outcome.
Â 
She became quite jealous of Sansa when Tyrion tried to comfort Sansa in her grief. I guess that was one of the points when she realized that she had lost. Not only Tyrion as a Lord, but also her bed warmer who began to care for his wife. Even though Tyrion never bedded Sansa of course.
Â 
We also know the outcome of the trial by combat - I won't spoil it here for the Unsullied. Tyrion has nothing more to lose actually, he was declined his birthright. Shae moves on to another powerful man - his father. Maybe he's promised her riches, whatever.
Â 
My guess is that Shae makes this whole "Sansa and Tyrion did it together" thing up to further underline her 'story' she tells the judges, and of course, that's what Tywin wants to hear in a certain way. It makes Tyrion more likely Joffrey's killer in the end. Sansa is away, Tyrion is still in KL. And at the moment, Sansa's very much out of reach of Tywin.
Â 
It's the trial that shows how very much dysfunctional this family is. And destructive. Even on "simple" persons like Shae.
1807	jugdesh258	2014-05-13	I would say that the fact that Sansa is implicated by Shae is the best evidence that she is being coerced
Â 
The reason you have doubts might be the other changes in the trial.Â Â  Mostly all the testimony was evidently farce in the book.Â  It was a show trial .....at least Jaime can see that and he frees Tyrion later on.
Â 
The addition of the necklace actually does implicate Sansa.Â  Not sure why they did this.Â Â  Pycell was not supposed to have the poison most suspected of being used.Â Â  In seeing that Tyrion should believe that Sansa is guilty and framed him
1808	Seneti	2014-05-13	Â 
I read somewhere, that even the actress playing Shae Sibel Kekilli wanted to have the part of her testimony removed, where she blamed Sansa.


Â 
Yeah, I read that, too, which proves that Sibel Kekilli certainly has a good understanding of characterization (regardless of what people may think of her acting abilities).
Â 


I don't think there is any way Tyrion's actions will be different than in the books. He even called her a lying whore in the show.
Bye Shae.


Â 
Exactly. I don't get why people think that Tyrion will not do what he did in his last ASOS chapter. He has made it very clear that he hates Shae for her betrayal (and this is only the first part of her betrayal - we book readers know that the real whammy is yet to come).
Â 


They couldn't have had a Cersei forcing Shae to testify scene before the trial as it would have ruined the surprise of her appearance at the end.
They might have a scene next week where Cersei says Well done, we won't slit your throat and feed you to fish in Blackwater bay".


Â 
I agree. I just hope that there will be a scene in episode 7 or 8 where we see Cersei/Tywin talking with Shae and giving some explanation as to why she testified.
1809	rell87	2014-05-13	The viewer fell into the same trap as Tyrion, believing a whore was anything more then a whore.
1810	Charles Phipps	2014-05-13	The viewer fell into the same trap as Tyrion, believing a whore was anything more then a whore.


Â 
Whores are no different than any other people. Littlefinger aside.
1811	ChillinLikeSerIlyn	2014-05-13	Shae was almost certainly coerced by Cersei/Tywin into testifying and making up that whole story about Sansa, etc. but I thought it was clear she wanted to be vindictive to Tyrion as well (Cersei would never have come up with the whole "he wanted me to call him my lion" thing). Shae wanted to humiliate him.
Â 
While some people are saying this is out of character for the show-version of Shae, who genuinely seemed to love Tyrion, I think it can be viewed as in character if you think about her personality in the show. While it would seem on the surface that she is just angry about Tyrion calling her a whore and sending her away, I don't feel she is that stupid to not realize what he was doing. However, I do think his dismissal of her in general angered her due to pride.Â 
Â 
While Tyrion is clearly a character who is often done in by his pride, I think show-Shae is somewhat similar. When we first meet her, she is adamant that she did not grow up a whore or come from necessarily bad circumstances. She later tells Sansa she will not let anyone hurt her, and seems to really believe in her own ability in this regard, despite not really backing it up in any way. She continually rebuffed Tyrion's concerns about his father/sister being able to hurt her. This all leads me to think that she is angry at Tyrion for not trusting in her "abilities" to take care of herself and get things done, so she is willing to skewer him publicly. Essentially, a "he's not with me so I'm against him" approach.Â
1812	starklinson	2014-05-13	since tyrion is such a fan favorite, I doubt they'll show him killing Shae. and I agree with the actress about the Sansa thing. Had they left that bit out, it would've been better.

Â 
Moving aside all the other evidence, why would fans dislike him for killing Shae? 1. she betrayed him and we didn't even see the biggest part of betrayal yet 2. the character appears to be disliked by majority of audience
1814	SeventySeven	2014-05-13	I don't think there is any way Tyrion's actions will be different than in the books. He even called her a lying whore in the show.

Â 
This.
Â 
I think people need to remember that while they twist characterisations quite a bit, they don't change main plot points. Which for me is part of the issue (but also isn't, I don't want them to change the main story), they change characters so much that it becomes contrived when they put them back into their book storyline again.Â 
Â 
I get that Shae is being forced and has little choice on the matter, but I don't understand why building up that friendship and love for Sansa only to just drop it as if it never happened.
1815	Sun	2014-05-13	I agree with the OP, but I'll wait and see how the show explains her behaviour before I pass final judgement.Â

I think D&D made the right call here with disagreeing with Sibel and keeping her accusations of Sansa - it shows that her testimony was manipulated this much and she did everything that was asked of her.
Â 
While it lasted Sansa/Shae thing was kinda nice, Kekili was actually decent in those scenes.

Â 
I didn't look at it that way, you might have a point. As I wrote in another thread, when she answered to Tyrion "Don't" with "I'm a whore" it was clear it was yes a nod to what he called her before sending her away, but also about the fact she has no choice on testifying against him exactly because she's a whore, expendable and with no power. The Sansa bit left me a bit baffled, but if I look at it that way maybe it makes sense. We'll see.

Â 
Q: When I talked to Sibel Kekilli at the Season 4 premiere, she said she really didn't think Shae should implicate Sansa. Why was it so important that plot point be kept in the show?A: That's interesting. It's a tricky thing, and I hesitate to comment on it too much because I sort of feel like you want the viewers to not be totally sure. I don't want to give a definitive answer about why Shae said what she said, because it kind of affects things later on. It was important in terms of what Cersei wants out of this, and "Tyrion and Sansa did this," she wants that narrative out there -- and I think she believes it. But she's not above manipulating the trial to make sure that the guilty verdict is rendered. Assuming Cersei had something to do with Shae popping up as the witness, and I think that's fair to say, that is certainly something that Cersei would be interested in making sure was spelled out.
Â 
So it looks like a combination of her own grudge but also with some kind of (sincere or not) assurance from her capturers with regard to Sansa (and maybe Tyrion) surviving despite the testimony.

Â 

	Spoiler The one I really cannot wait to see is the Tywin involvement. Depending on Shae's motives here and when it started they can really manipulate things so much - was she forced? did she make a deal for Tyrion?Â  did she do it out of spite? did Tywin assure her she'll be safe and was her new 'lion'? So many possibilities.

As I wrote in another thread, when she answered to Tyrion "Don't" with "I'm a whore" it was clear it was yes a nod to what he called her before sending her away, but also about the fact she has no choice on testifying against him exactly because she's a whore, expendable and with no power. The Sansa bit left me a bit baffled, but if I look at it that way maybe it makes sense. We'll see.


Â 
Very nice point, also makes more sense why Shae would look so worried and concerned when Tyrion says he wants a trial by combat.
1821	FalseKnight	2014-05-13	I was really surprised, when I saw the episode, that they had not changed Shae's testimony and her reasons for doing it , since they had made her a lot nicer, than in the books.
I think it will be very hard for show-viewers only to accept, that show-Shae, who genuinely loved Tyrion and who stayed even when offered a good amount of gold for leaving him and going to Essos basically sold Tyrion out.
Â 
I saw the HBO videos accompanying this episode (Inside the episode, etc. ) and they made it clear, that Shae had been somehow coerced into it by Cersei. But why did we never see this? It would have cost 2 minutes maximum in either this episode on in the last to have a scene, in which Cersei threatens Shae with torture etc. if she does not tell lies about Tyrion in the trial.
Â 
Likewise, I found it really odd, that show-Shae was willing to implicate Sansa in the murder of Joffrey, since she was quite fond of her in the show and even tried to hide the fact, that she had flowered. ( In the books was quite greedy and I therefore was not surprised, when she spoke against her especially as we later hear that Cersei had promised her a manse).
Additionally, I found it quite odd, that Shae gave her testimony wearing one of Sansa's dresses, since it made her look greedy, which is in contrast to the Shae HBO had portrayed before.
Â 
A lot of book-readers have speculated, that Shae would somehow implicate Tyrion, because she tries to save Sansa, which is also what I had assumed would happen.
Â 
What do you think about this choice in the adaption?

Did you miss the scenes of tension between Tyrion and Shae since his wedding? Maybe I missed all the happy scenes between them, but Shae has been pissed for a while. We have a scorned woman and a queen willing to to pay to manipulate the Westerosi justice system.
1822	Red Tiger	2014-05-13	Â 

	Spoiler The one I really cannot wait to see is the Tywin involvement. Depending on Shae's motives here and when it started they can really manipulate things so much - was she forced? did she make a deal for Tyrion?Â  did she do it out of spite? did Tywin assure her she'll be safe and was her new 'lion'? So many possibilities. 




Â 

	Spoiler Was she Tywin's spy from the start? He knew Tyrion would take her to King's Landing.
1823	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-13	They'll likely have a scene next ep to show Â who coerced Shae.
1824	harokin	2014-05-13	I can easily see Shae betraying both Tyrion and Sansa of her own free will. She could be the type of person who's fiercely loyal to those who are loyal to her, and ruthless to those she feels has wronged her. Black and white worldview and all that. Once Tyrion sent her away, she could have gone all "f'k all these people. I'll get 'em!". I hope there's no coercion scene.
1825	clawson24	2014-05-14	I'll be extremely disappointed if they remove Tyrion killing Shae. I can't fathom why they would but the mere fact that people have been speculating that they might for quite some time worries me. It's such a jarring and important moment in his character development.
1826	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-05-14	As if Tyrion won't kill Shae... Howay get a grip. 
Of course he will. It's one if the scenes that makes the books so awesome. 
People just like to whinge about nothing.
1827	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-14	Of course he will, hes got to have his descent to complete rock bottom
1828	LaughingTreeMaiden	2014-05-14	Hello! This is my first post on the forums.Â 
Â 
I despised Book Shae but agree with the poster that TV Shae genuinely loved Tyrion. It seems obvious from her jumpy behaviour during the trial that she was coerced, but I'd say it was by Tywin rather than Cersei. Perhaps Tywin gave her the same assurance as he gave Jaime - that Tyrion would be sent to the Wall if found guilty?Â 
Â 
She's clearly hurt by Tyrion calling her a whore who's slept with 5000 men, not good enough to marry or bear his children etc etc in their last interaction. Those tears were real. It wasn't completely out of the blue to be suspicious either, as Tyrion had refused to touch her or answer her question about love shortly before that (I forget which episodes those were!)
Â 
And unlike the audience, Shae doesn't know Tyrion's real reason for sending her away and isn't objective enough to reflect and figure it out. So I'd say her testimony was a mix of fear (of Tywin) and revenge, where the price Tyrion would pay for breaking her heart would be to join the Night's Watch and never father any children or inherit anything. That seems like a reasonable payoff for a woman scorned, especially a hot-headed one like Shae.Â 
Â 
The only anomaly is her incriminating Sansa in Joffrey's murder. Perhaps she felt Sansa was already in a safe place and so would not be affected by her testimony?Â 
Â 
Shae will die soon in the show but I think she will be killed by Tywin or Cersei. Two reasons for this: one, it would prove she was being coerced and make her a sympathetic character again (possibly just while being killed)
Â 
Two, it would let Tyrion keep his hands unsullied. That last scene may have finally shown us a 'darker' side of Tyrion but I don't think the whitewashing is going to stop. He can't remain a TV favourite if he starts strangling women. In fact they might just show Tyrion's murder of Tywin as being motivated by Tywin killing Shae.
Â 
Would love to read feedback!
1829	Yojimbo	2014-05-14	As if Tyrion won't kill Shae... Howay get a grip.
Of course he will. It's one if the scenes that makes the books so awesome.
People just like to whinge about nothing.


Â 
And people just like to winge about people wingeing about 'nothing', whats your point?
Â 
And just because it is great in the books why would it be great for the show? Honestly if they are going to stick to the source material this season and next, then the show writers are going to have Tyrion aka the star of the show (come on lets face it Dinklage is the shows main star/fan favorite) being pissed up, angry, depressed and constanly getting on and off boats...........his story is just a longer more depressing version of Brans journey to the children and we have already seen what they did this season to that story and I can imagen Bran is no where near as popular as Tyrion.
Â 
Have a look at what Tyrion story has him doing throughout the seasons;
Â 
Season 1:
Â 
Tyrion gets captured by Catelyn
Tyrion on trial at the Eyrie
Tyrion get captured by the Hills
Tyrion meets Shae
We learn about Tysha (the only time in the show we truely get any insight about Tyrion/Tysha relationship)
Gets knocked out before the battle
Tyrion is made acting Hand and sent to King's Landing
Full of character/relationship development throughtout the season
Â 
Season 2
Â 
Tyrion doing many tasks around King's Landing include
(getting rid of of Janos Slynt by sending him to the Wall)
(arresting Maester Pycelle)
(sends Littlefinger off to broker a deal with Cat to release Jamie)
(many others (hope you get my point))
Tyrion clash's with Cersei and Joffery in a power struggle
Mustering the defenses for the city for the up and coming battle
Fights in the Battle of Blackwater and holds the city
Gets injured in battle
Again full of character/relationship development throughtout the season
Â 
Season 3
Â 
Tyrion actually doesn't do much this season and what I feel was when the show made many changes to Tyrion and Shae but we still get;
Tyrion trying to hide Shae from Cersei and his Father
Still on the kings council
Marrying Sansa
Not much actual charecter development other than his relationship with Shae and his decreasing relationship with his family
Â 
Season 4
Â 
What we seen so far;
Tyrion continuing the development relationship with Shae, Sansa and his family
Purple Wedding and his accused murder of Joffery
Tyrion locked up and his defence for his innocence is looking bad
The trial (and imo changed from the books at least where Shae is concerned)
What we know from the books will happen;
Trial by combatÂ 
His escape
Him killing Shae and his father
And findingout that Tysha was not a whore and actually loved him
Â 
As a side note we have not once heared about Tysha this season
Season 5
Â 
What we know from the books will happen and what seems that aFfC and aDwD will be merged;
Â 
Tyrion on a boat to essos
Stays with Illyrio at Pentos
Meets up with Griff and crew
Travel to Volantis on a boat
Get captured by Jorah and meets Penny in Selhorys
Back on a boat to Meereen, meets Moqorro
Gets captured by slavers
Sold as a slave
Life as a slave
Escapes and joins the Second Sons
With Tyrion all this time either being drunk, angry, mean, depressed, hopeless or a mix of the lot. And non stop thinking about Tysha
Â 
Yep we are going to see filler for Tyrion next season and it going to involve Shae

1830	Bear Island	2014-05-14	I'm still not convinced Tyrion will kill them both. Show Tyrion is so, so whitewashed and beloved by the Unsullied. For him to kill both of them after being such a pure force of good... not sure they can really do that. I HOPE they do it because Tyrion is one of the most complex, grey characters in the books and is in no way a pure good guy.
I can see him accidentally killing one of them, or Shae being killed by someone else. I could see him accidentally killing Tywin in the heat of the moment or by accidentally discharging the crossbow. Likewise I could see him grappling with Shae out of anger and her falling down the stairs or something. He kills her in such a cruel and intense way in the books, and show Tyrion (as broken as he is) just doesn't seem to have that kind of cruelty in him the way the book version does.

1831	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-14	He NEEDS to kill them both, he just CANT stay a big fan favourite after these acts, it's IMPORTANT to his character that he descends from genuinely likable, witty, and intelligent and sympathetic to...well, a murderer, a rapist, a drunken lech. He BECOMES the monster that people saw him as before.Â
1832	TepidHands	2014-05-14	In Season 3 ("Kissed by Fire") Tyrion does remind Tywin that he was married before, when Tywin and Cersei are telling him he's to marry Sansa. So it's not like it was never mentioned. I expect if we see that clip again in a "previously" introduction, Shae will wind up a dead woman by the "Rains of Castamere" cello over the credits.
1833	Caucasian_rodent	2014-05-14	This is mostly a copy of what I wrote elsewhere:
Â 
"After today's episode I think Shae has genuine feelings for Tyrion.
This is based mostly on her actresses acting: When Tyrion adresses her for the first time during the trial you can hear her voice falter before she continues her speech. Also, just after Tyrion demands a trial by combat you see how she looks very surprised and franctic (eyes flitting back and forth). Clearly, this is something she did not expect nor wished for.
Â 
My hypothesis is that Shae was not coerced into saying what she said in the sense that her life was threatened (or at least this is not the only reason). I rather think she was offered a deal by Tywin in much the same way Jamie was = "you tell on him, make him (and Sansa) look bad / guilty, and I make sure he survives and send him to the Wall".
Her agreeing on this would also be more fitting of the personality we have seen in Shae so far.
In other words: Shae is trying to protect Tyrion by doing what Tywin asked of her so that Tyrion will be send to the Wall rather than executed.
The reason for Shae blaming Sansa, too, might have been another part of the deal. So Shae might just want to make really sure that she's fulfilling her part of the deal.
I think that Tywin did not expect Tyrion to be that deeply in love with Shae. He wanted Tyrion to be pushed, but not that far.
Â 
From Tyrion's point of view it somewhat makes sense that Shae betrays him - with him sending her away and all. I think GRRM included that part at that point in time to make it believable for both Tyrion and the readers that Shae did just that.
Â 
One more thing: maybe Shae's sleeping with Tywin was another attempt of hers to have him free Tyrion (or something of the sort).
Â 
Also, I think that the show is not really deviating from Shae's motives in the books here. The difference is, that - in the show - we are not biased by Tyrion's POV."

That's an interesting idea. Tywin might have wanted someone to closely watch what Tyrion was doing as the King's Hand.
What if Shae unintentionelly fell in love with Tyrion at some point in between?

Killing her off will be GREAT!!!!
1837	Uldra I	2014-05-14	....Â 
The addition of the necklace actually does implicate Sansa.Â  Not sure why they did this.Â Â  Pycell was not supposed to have the poison most suspected of being used.Â Â  In seeing that Tyrion should believe that Sansa is guilty and framed him


Â 
When LF took Sansa onboard ship, he said no one would suspect him, and asked her who she thought they would suspect.Â  "You." he told her, because of his poison necklace she wore.Â  I had wondered long and hard about why Sansa had the poison planted on her instead of just giving it to Olenna in the first place.Â  After that scene on the ship, I came to the conclusion that LF framed her so that he'd have leverage over Sansa, so she'd have no choice but to go with him.
Â 
ETA:Â  regarding OP:Â  It seems she was reciting lines until the last when she looked at Tyrion with IMO definite malice and spite.Â  I literally hated her so much after that scene for her betrayal.Â  Someone in another thread had pointed out that Pod also was told he will be forced to testify.Â  He left KL to avoid it.Â  Shae was supposedly already out at sea before the purple wedding, but they found her anyway.Â  Did she stay because she refused to leave, or was she captured?Â  I wonder...

They couldn't have shown it previously because they wanted that Big Shocking Moment when Shae walks into and takes the witness stand.
1840	Volverin	2014-05-14	I think it must be changed. Not the Tyrion killing Shae part but the Tyrion saying "Where do whores go?" part. It was never mentioned in the show and I can't imagine Tyrion using that line, would be completely out of context. He might remind him about Tysha in some way though.

Â 
When I read the books, I felt that Shae really loved Tyrion in the way a Whore can hope to love a Lord. Same of the show. People try to make Shae a cardbook character, but she really does love, hate, respect, and is very angy at Tyrion all at the same time. Plus having the Queen coerce her on top of her own emotions.

1842	ohpooratlas	2014-05-14	To this day I am not the least bit convinced that book Shae ever loved Tyrion. I'm sure she was also coerced, but I viewed it as being convenient coercion.
Â 
I remember reading Sibel's interview saying that she felt uncomfortable when Shae implicated Sansa, because Shae would never do that because she loved Sansa. All I can think in regards to the necklace is that a.) this line will be more important down the road when Sansa is reintroduced as a player in the game. Regicide is not something people easily forgive, or forget. b.) the show is really trying to drive home the fact that Sansa has to remain hidden right now. She can't reveal herself because if she does, she is a fugitive and people will feel inclined to turn her into King's Landing. This is always kind of implied in the books, but I never felt it was made explicit. Littlefinger reveals his plan to have her claim the Eyrie and appeal to the Northern Lords with her reveal, but he makes no suggestion that her supposed regicide will still be an issue.
Â 
Also, I'm pretty sure Shae is a dead duck. And everyone I've talked to that have not read the books hate her. They don't care if she's being coerced.

Â 
TV shows have to be more explicit than thousand page novels. Of course, if Tyrion is accusedÂ  than Sansa is at the very least implicated. The show entered the necklace as physical evidence.Â  In the book, the hairnetÂ  never shows up in Tyrion's trail.

in the second episode of the season when they are at breakfast cersei points out to tywin that shae is tyrion's whore and he tells her to send her up to his chambers so it may have started at that point.Â

Â 
Well, we're not at the point where it occurred in the books either. "Where do whores go" only came up after Tyrion's last conversation with Tywin, which we have yet to see. And I'm sure Jaime's last convo with Tyrion will go down almost exactly as it did in the books, meaning that we will be reminded of Tysha just in time to set up "where do whores go".
1846	Woman of War	2014-05-14	I really like this idea and makes tyrion even darker.
This would  not make Tyrion darker but more tragic, to make him darker he would have to intentionally ignore Shae's motivation but you assume a tragic misunderstanding.
1847	johnnysd	2014-05-15	since tyrion is such a fan favorite, I doubt they'll show him killing Shae. and I agree with the actress about the Sansa thing. Had they left that bit out, it would've been better.


Â 
They have not shied away from a major plot point yet. Shae gets a bolt.Â
1848	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-15	This would  not make Tyrion darker but more tragic, to make him darker he would have to intentionally ignore Shae's motivation but you assume a tragic misunderstanding.I don't mean actually darker, but darker to the audience if they sympathise more with shae.

Yes, the audience would get that painful feeling of proxy shame we all have if someone beloved does something stupid, ridiculous or evil, the Othello-feeling......If they had only talked when there was time........
Not that carmic feeling some may have if they choose to see things black and white: She had it coming.
All would be more conflicted, Shae's death would be more tragic, if Tyrion ever realizes what moved her at least partially it will be more devastating for him, no room for that cheap carmic relief because an antagonist dies by the hand of a protagonist, the emotion flat entertainment tries to sell us as Happy Ending.
Tyrion would be an example of a tragic hero in Greek tragedy, made guilty by desinformation.
But even as it is now, without further description of Shae's motives, that flat "she had it coming" is out of the question if watchers refrain from being judgemental before thinking. Shae is far more complicated than in the books. And the scene in Tywin's bedchamber will come, I am sure, and will offer more room for interpretation (and heavy forum fighting   ).
Btw, I have to get rid of a rant, not against the show but against the concept of Shae in the books, and that from me who is one of those simple minded hopeless book and show apologists who uncritically admire artistic achievements 
In the books Shae has from the beginning been shaped as cardboard stereotype of a whore. Already her name is only one letter away from "She" as some kind of female moral archetype. Shae was never supposed to have an identity, a story of her own, she has always been there to illuminate Tyrion's deep personal issues and delusions with his desire to be loved and respected. So she was morally one dimensional in the books. As reaction posters try to invent all evils from Tyrion's side against her like "he stole from her" and "he mistreated her" in order to give her at least some motivation, some story, some identity. This is imo more a sign of justified frustration with Martin's writing than a correct interpretation of what is in the books. There is nothing in the books. Nothing about Shae to give her any depth and this is exactly what makes me angry. I also have tried to write quasi-fanfic in these forums to explain and understand Shae's despicable behaviour at the trial......abused child who never learned empathy.....lower class girl who had to look after herself.... Yaddayadda....because I did not want to see the sex worker and woman demeaned.
But this was the result of a sad omission from Martin's side. Fleshing out Shae may have appeared an unnecessary filler since all was about Tyrion but it would not have been. Tyrion's characterization suffers from leaving Shae so very pale, a side effect the author underestimated imo. I write this as huge fan of book Tyrion as well as show Tyrion.
And the show tried to correct that with good reason, though maybe they have overdone it. Making her so dedicated in protecting Sansa gave them plot trouble by now. And Sansa had to be seriously implicated by Shae or by whomever, a hunted criminal totally dependent of Baelish, seen as capable of murdering again, a victim of negative propaganda.
Yes, the Butterfly Effect... But in that case it was the author and not the show who started it, sorry Mr. Martin.
1850	LordStoneheart	2014-05-15	Has this been mentioned before? Putting this in spoilers since everyone may not have seen it.
Â 

	Spoiler 
There's a very brief scene in the promo where Shae is lying on a bed and appears to sit up, looking very surprised. Last season GRRM's episode was titled The Bear and the Maiden Fair, but it was originally "Autumn Storms" and then retitled "Chains" before it's final title. In that episode Tyrion gives her a gold necklace that Shae insists is a chain. It think considering these things it's pretty obvious Tyrion will definitely kill her. I mean, we can't know for sure but I'm 99.99999%


Â 
Plus, this "whitewashed" Saint Halfman of Lannister that is impersonating the real Tyrion will have an arguably "greyer" moment since he's not shown himself to be a killer before but will kill her very angrily.

Yeah but perhaps it just points out to him becoming aware of her in that moment, not starting...doing her  But you may be right, anyways I'm very curious to see if they answer when and how their relations began.

I completely agree it's happening. As for chains I'm sure it's the chains that will be the cause (why show them otherwise, unless it was just a playful nod on George's part) - the only problem is that we didn't Shae accept them in that scene from 3x07.

"After today's episode I think Shae has genuine feelings for Tyrion.
This is based mostly on her actresses acting: When Tyrion adresses her for the first time during the trial you can hear her voice falter before she continues her speech. Also, just after Tyrion demands a trial by combat you see how she looks very surprised and franctic (eyes flitting back and forth). Clearly, this is something she did not expect nor wished for.
Â 
My hypothesis is that Shae was not coerced into saying what she said in the sense that her life was threatened (or at least this is not the only reason). I rather think she was offered a deal by Tywin in much the same way Jamie was = "you tell on him, make him (and Sansa) look bad / guilty, and I make sure he survives and send him to the Wall".
Her agreeing on this would also be more fitting of the personality we have seen in Shae so far.
In other words: Shae is trying to protect Tyrion by doing what Tywin asked of her so that Tyrion will be send to the Wall rather than executed.
The reason for Shae blaming Sansa, too, might have been another part of the deal. So Shae might just want to make really sure that she's fulfilling her part of the deal.
I think that Tywin did not expect Tyrion to be that deeply in love with Shae. He wanted Tyrion to be pushed, but not that far.
Â 
From Tyrion's point of view it somewhat makes sense that Shae betrays him - with him sending her away and all. I think GRRM included that part at that point in time to make it believable for both Tyrion and the readers that Shae did just that.
Â 
One more thing: maybe Shae's sleeping with Tywin was another attempt of hers to have him free Tyrion (or something of the sort).
Â 
Also, I think that the show is not really deviating from Shae's motives in the books here. The difference is, that - in the show - we are not biased by Tyrion's POV."


Â 
I just recently watched a review of the episode and noticed the look on Shae's face after Tyrion demands trial by combat.Â  I began to suspect the same thing because what reason would she have to be worried?
Â 
Although, it could be that her life or freedom was contingent on a guilty verdict and a trial by combat could potentially mess that up.Â 
Â 
In any case, I'm not as certain of her intentions as I was before.
1856	kacunnin	2014-05-15	I know I'm new here -- I read all five books in the six weeks leading up to the start of Season 4, so my perspective is a bit different from the many long-time fans.Â  I got to know Tyrion and Shae from the HBO series before I saw how they were presented in the books.Â  And when I got to the scene in the book where Tyrion kills Shae I was shocked.Â  And I just can't see how show-Tyrion can kill show-Shae without his character being irreparably damaged.
Â 
Here's the problem -- not only is show-Shae a much more sympathetic character (she clearly loves Tyrion, and she has several times done things to suggest she is NOT involved with him for the money), but she has a much bigger part in the story than she does in the books.Â  We never get her POV in the books, which means we never get to see her interact with characters other than Tyrion.Â  In the show, we see Shae offer to run away with Tyrion after he's wounded, we see her refuse Varys's diamonds, we hear her say she'd give her life for Sansa, and we see her break down in tears after Tyrion cruely dumps her.
Â 
In the book, Tyrion kills Shae because he believes she has betrayed him for gold (she's wearing his father's Hand neckace), and he thinks she's made a fool of him.Â  He has learned that Tysha wasn't a "lying whore" after all, but he believes Shae was.Â  In the show, Tyrion betrays Shae BEFORE she betrays him -- he dumps her, telling her point blank that she's a whore and that he wants a life with his wife.Â  This is a common soap opera trope -- the good guy is dumping his girlfriend to "protect her" from the bad guys, and she's too stupid to get it.Â  The things Tyrion said to Shae in the show were very hurtful, and she was clearly devastated.Â  You can argue that she should have understood what he was doing, but the whole thing was played like a bad episode of "Days of Our Lives."Â 
Â 
If show-Tyrion kills Shae, he will be doing a very terrible thing.Â  First, he was the one who set her betrayal in motion, and he knows that.Â  Second, it's pretty obvious that Shae was coerced into speaking against Tyrion and Sansa (her words against Sansa, especially, should have made that clear to Tyrion).Â  Third, she's a whore (as Tyrion keeps reminding himself), and as such she belongs to the one who pays her -- just as Bronn does.Â  You don't kill a whore you've dumped because she gets herself a new employer.
Â 
In the book, Shae seduces Tyrion (among the dragon bones) BEFORE she betrays him.Â  This doesn't happen in the show, which goes a long way to keep Shae a sympathetic character.Â 
Â 
I don't believe show-Tyrion will kill show-Shae.Â  But I do believe Shae will be killed -- probably by Tywin (who promised to kill Tyrion's whore if he ever brought her to court).Â  But we'll see.Â  Tyrion is such a popular character for the HBO audience, and his killing Shae could undermine that popularity.Â 
Â 
I'm also not convinced that Jaime will tell Tyrion the truth about Tysha, since she's nowhere near the powerful force in show-Tyrion's life that she is in the books.Â  Yes, the story of what happened with his first wife is told in Season One, and there have been a few veiled references to Tysha (not by name, though) since then, but in the book Tyrion thinks about Tysha all the time and what happened (or what he believes happened) fuels his feelings about Shae (he warns himself over and over again not to ever trust in her love).Â  That's not the case in the show -- Tyrion KNOWS Shae loves him, which is why he has to hurt her to get her to leave him.Â  You don't do that to someone and then kill them!
Â 
Thanks for listening, guys.Â
1857	FNF	2014-05-15	They already had that scene where Tyrion shows Shae the necklace of golden hands. I doubt very much that Tyrion won't kill Shae...
1858	igrewupinKL	2014-05-15	Thanks for listening, guys.Â 


Â 
Loved you're whole post. But as you argued, despite show-tyrion killing show-shae not making sense, i still think it's going to happen. I think it just undermines Tyrions character a little. In the book, Tyrion had very good reason to get angry at the trial. But in the show, I thought it was really clear, at least in part, that Shae was forced to testify against Tyrion. And it undermines Tyrions character not to have noticed this.
When Shae says "I'm a whore remember?". It pushes Tyrion over the edge as he knows it's her saying that not someone else. I think its a little weak, but that little thing is why tyrion will kill shae.
1859	Gran de Lys	2014-05-15	Â 
Â 
They have not shied away from a major plot point yet. Shae gets a bolt.Â 
Â 
From your typing fingers to D&D's ears ... Fingers crossed.
1860	Yojimbo	2014-05-15	Ok lets get this necklace we saw out of the way, now I imagine we are all book readers here so when we saw the necklace (one I might add Shae refuses/turns down),Â  how is that any insight that show Tyrion is going to kill Shae? But a better question would be is how is this any insight for our unsullied friends? After all they don't know Tyrion kills Shae in the books with the King's Hand Chain and the King's Hand Chain only becomes important point for us book readers because of the song "Hands of gold are always cold". Do you really think our unsullied friends are going to be like "OMG THERE THAT NECKLACE WE SAW FOR A FEW SECONDS IN SEASON 3! THAT SONG WE NEVER HEARED BECAUSE IT GOT CUT FROM THE SHOW ALL MAKES SENSE NOW! D&D ARE GENIUS! THEY PRETTY MUCH GIVE US FORESIGHT INTO SHAE DEATH!"? Nope, I think not. I see that necklace as just a red herring for us book readers.
Â 
Secondly, Tysha; now again remember we only know so much about Tysha as readers because she plays a far bigger part in book Tyrions thoughts, but our unsullied friends only actually know her name from one episode in season 1, and a few offhand refereances refering to her (can't remember myself if they actually say her name after season 1) show Tyrion has never actually spoke about her in any more detail since. Now I asked my brother (unsullied) the other day do you remember what happened to Tyrions first wife? He said what happened to her. I then said you don't remember her name by any chance I have seemed to forgot it? He was pretty convinced they never actually said her name.........now my brother is by no means a stupid guy, I love my brother to bits and whats more I forgive him because how in the hell is any unsullied suppose to remember a name given to them in season 1? Who has played no huge part in Tyrions charecter since and next season all he going to go on about is Tysha?
Â 
Nope, they merged Shaes and Tysha characters together, hence why TV Shae loves Tyrion, Shae is going to get shipped off to Essos, giving Tyrions charecter something todo for filler because if you think the show is going to have Tyrion all next season getting on and off boats being drunk, pissed off, depressed and hopeless then you got another thing coming. They have already changed Tyrions charecter in the show already, why do people not think they won't do this again, I ask?
Â 
*Edit*
Â 
As a side note do you guys think we are going to get Penny and Pig next season? You know the characters we never saw at the Purple Wedding? (well less Penny was one of them male dwarf's and will get a sex change before next season) And only knows it Tyrion because a noseless dwarf is not a common sight to see, owait Tyrion still got his nose.....

A very well written post. But I feel there is one bit where your argument is weak. It's not obvious that she has been completely coerced or that she is not testifying for her own purposes as well as being either bribed or threatened. She purposefully reveals the most intimate moments of their relationship. If she was testifying against her will she could have easily just made stuff up. But she doesn't, she tells the truth or at least a truth. The only reason for revealing these things is to hurt Tyrion as much as possible. It's not like Cersei can tell her what to say, she couldn't know the exact details of their conversations.
Â 
With that in mind even if she is being bribed or threatened. Which lets face it is likely, it's the Lannisters after all. It doesn't change the fact that she is hurting Tyrion because she wants to.

Â 
If you really think that Tyrion who almost exploded just after seeing Shae testify (which he deep down might have realized she was forced to do) and called her a lying whore is not gonna kill her after he finds out she was sleeping with his own father....you may be in for the biggest shock out of all of us during finale.

Â 
Well, yes Tyrion did explode, at ever one......hell Cersei got the worst of it. Hell he only implied Shae was a lying whore never directly at her, in fact he included Cersei in that aswell. "Give me more relief than a thousand lying whores!" all the while speaking to Cersei, all Shae gets from it is a quick glance from Tyrion. And as you said, Tyrion probly has worked out in his heart of hearts Shae had no choice in it. Sleeping with Tywin as far as am concerned is pure speculation and there plenty of evidence in the show already of them cutting out details. Or did you not think in the books when Tyrion orders Bronn to make Symon Silver Tounge 'disappear' and Bronn suggests there a pot shop in Flea Bottom with a "savory bowl of brown" with "all kinds of meat in it" not important to Tyrions character? Because I did, the show didn't though.
On the shocked part, I really wouldn't be shocked if he does kill Shae, just shows what a pack of hacks D&D are if they do.

Â 
I disagree.Â  There are only three reasons Shae could be testifiying against Tyrion (and Sansa), since she knows full well that neither are guilty.Â  1) She has been coerced (the most logical reason), 2) she has been bribed (more later), and 3) she's pissed and wants to hurt him as much as he hurt her.
Â 
Reason #2 (that she has been bribed) makes little sense, since Tyrion knows full well that Shae has refused bribes before.Â  She threw Varys's diamonds in his face, and she refused Tyrion's offer of jewelry and a nice house of her own.Â  She also offered to run away with Tyrion after he was wounded -- to get away from all of the Lannisters (and their money/power).Â  None of those things happened in the book.Â  This is a different Shae.
Â 
So if we rule out Reason #2, the only ones left are coersion and vengeance.Â  Whichever is the truth, Tyrion has no justification for killing Shae.Â  If she's been coerced, then killing her would be downright horrible -- what was she supposed to do, die for him after he dumped her?Â  And if she wants vengeance, he has to know he brought that on himself.Â  He chose to use that stupid "I don't love you, you're a whore" gambit, and if she's angry and hurt enough to turn on him, so be it.Â  Either way, there is no justification for him killing her.
Â 
The HBO team may decide to go along with the book version of events, but it will undermine show-Tyrion's character.Â  There's no way I could justify his killing Shae given they way things have unfolded on the show.

Â 
No, they are hacks when they write Shae and Tyrion as mutual lovers and still have Tyrion kill Shae. Otherwise it brings into question things like, if Shae was just a gold digging whore all this time, why in the 7 hells did she refuse Varys bag of diamonds? Still it changes the dynamic of Tyrions charecter aswell from the books, he kills Shae in the books for being a whore....you know the thing he actually imployed her for......was it Shae's fault Tyrion feel in love with her?
Â 
As for the picture, then guess we are going to see Tyrion make a bull charge for Shae's neck if that what we got to go by with her death lol

Never said Tysha is the reason why he is in Essos, if any thing it shows Tyrion has hit rock bottom when his only hope he got left in life is a "fools dream" of finding and getting back together with Tysha a woman he (remember the gold coin, they cut that out of the show....) and half of Tywins men raped her.

She knew what Tywin did to Tyrion. She knew Tywin hated him. And she slept with him anyways. This has nothing to do with her being a whore.

So your saying then Shae is getting revenge on a man she loved, who if it wasn't for Jamie was going to be executed the next day, by shagging his dear old pop? Was TV Shae reading the books and thought "Shit! The Imp escapes! I better shag his dad right now to get my revenge!" jumps out of bed, puts on a nice frock and runs off to the Hand's Tower so Tyrion can catch them in the act? If so then I only wish TV Shae had read the rest of the chapter.............

You have no idea when Shae/Tywin relations started. They might have started immediately after Tyrion told her to go to Pentos.
Â 
I'd like to inform you that for a woman to get her revenge the party she is mad at does not need to be aware of it.

No but I find it very funny though that she is getting her 'revenge' by sleeping with Tywin, even though poor Tyrion will be dead the next day and would never have knew about it any way.

I said "A truth" in this case a subjective personal truth from her perspective mixed in with some lies. In this case truth does not equal reality.

So if we rule out Reason #2, the only ones left are coersion and vengeance.Â  Whichever is the truth, Tyrion has no justification for killing Shae.Â  If she's been coerced, then killing her would be downright horrible -- what was she supposed to do, die for him after he dumped her?Â  And if she wants vengeance, he has to know he brought that on himself.Â  He chose to use that stupid "I don't love you, you're a whore" gambit, and if she's angry and hurt enough to turn on him, so be it.Â  Either way, there is no justification for him killing her.
Â 
The HBO team may decide to go along with the book version of events, but it will undermine show-Tyrion's character.Â  There's no way I could justify his killing Shae given they way things have unfolded on the show.

Â 
In my own opinion she is probably testifying because of all three. But my real point is the nature of her testimony. The fine details of their intimate conversations. If she were testifying completely under duress there would be no need for her to reveal these things. Or she could have just made them up rather than repeating things that he had said to her word for word. There's no getting away from the fact that she intentionally set out to humiliate him. Whether under duress or not she could not have been compelled to do it in that way. That was her choice.
Â 
I'm also not making the case that her murder would be justified by her wanting vengeance on Tyrion. Only that vengeance is the primary motivation for her actions. In my humble opinion I don't think perjury or vengeance on a former lover to be offenses worthy of a death sentence. Call me a liberal for that if you will  But justice and death don't go hand in hand in westeros. I think Tyrion will get his revenge in what is the only socially acceptable way for a man to get vengence in the world of ice and fire. That is by killing those who have wounded you. As there's no chain of the hand but there is a pin.....I could see a bit of stabby stabby on the way for poor old Shae. 
Â 
Edit: An example of things she didn't have to reveal is the "I am yours and you are mine" possibly the most intimate and loving thing they said to each other. This wounds Tyrion deeply as she knew it would. It prompts him to beg Shae to stop at which she takes a deep breath and presses on. This is clearly vengence for her. From her perspective Tyrion has betrayed their love and made her feel like a whore, as if she is worthless. So she is acting in a way that he has told her to. As a mercenary who can be bought. The consequences of this will of course be his death. Which makes her vengance slightly on the extreme side.

Explained it in previous post.
Â 
Yes, I'm sure she's just chilling in that position with scared look on her face when Tyrion discovers her.


Â 
Then am sorry she could have never had a ounce of love for Tyrion in the first place. For some reason you think sleeping with a guys dad is worse than killing him, it is litreally nuts.
Â 
Tyrion was going to die, Shae would already of had her revenge and if she is bonking Tywin on the night before Tyrions execution then the writers of the show have not only made Shae a maniac but a total sociopath aswell.
1877	Uldra I	2014-05-15	I said "A truth" in this case a subjective personal truth from her perspective mixed in with some lies. In this case truth does not equal reality.


Â Okay.Â  just wanted to be sure you knew she is now an absolute liar as of the trial.Â  She didn't know anything about such a plot by Sansa with Tyrion, because there never was one (books or show).Â  So what she said on the stand was all lies.Â  Still, thanks for clarifying.
Â 


Â 
No but I find it very funny though that she is getting her 'revenge' by sleeping with Tywin, even though poor Tyrion will be dead the next day and would never have knew about it any way. That I find utterly hysterical or did Shae know Tyrion was never going to get executed, because he was going to escape? Also you have no idea if Tywin even sleeps with Shae, your just speculating as much as myself on that.


Â 
My guess is that as soon as she was brought to Tywin's chambers...Â  What a strange thing for Tywin to order BTW.Â  Why ask that Tyrion's whore be brought to his chambers?... Tywin and Shae had to reach some sort of agreement that prevented her from being executed.Â  Maybe they already had an agreement as previous posts suggest with spying and such.Â  Or maybe Tywin could not resist her charms?Â Â  Either way she was still alive for the trial and later is found 
	Spoiler  in Tywin's bed, obviously making herself at home, nude, andÂ wearing The Hand's Golden Chain of office.
.Â 
While that is still no "proof" that she slept with Tywin, I'll tell you as an adult female, women in a man's quarters don't make themselves feel that comfortable without license.

Â

1879	Uldra I	2014-05-15	To Banner Without Brothers:Â  Sorry, I don't know how to include quotes in my post (I'll figure it out, I'm sure!).Â  ...


Â also,Â using Internet Explorer 11, IÂ couldn't quote or place an avatar picture until I changed a setting on my browser.Â This might help.Â I did for me.Â
1880	1000AcresAndAHoldfast	2014-05-15	I guess it will depend on whether she ends up in Tywin's bed, in the trial scene it looked like she was testifying under duress where as in the book it was a much more straight up betrayal. Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned and Tyrion was fairly brutal in their last meeting together even though he obviously thought it was being cruel to be kind.Â
1881	Wouter	2014-05-15	Just like in the books, Shae is coerced into the testimony, but can'thelp but take some personal jabs at Tyrion.
Â 
When I read the books, I felt that Shae really loved Tyrion in the way a Whore can hope to love a Lord. Same of the show. People try to make Shae a cardbook character, but she really does love, hate, respect, and is very angy at Tyrion all at the same time. Plus having the Queen coerce her on top of her own emotions.


In the books, I don't think there is much reason to think Shae was coerced. Bribed, probably, but not coerced. There is no indication that Cersei or Tywin knew the nature of her relationship with Tyrion (unless Tywin was pulling the strings on her from the start), and we know that Sansa's other maid, Brella, was questioned but set loose without having to give testimony. So Cersei didn't just go all out with torture of random maids to see if she could get a useful confession, or Brella would have been up there at the trial as well, talking about how Sansa and Tyrion planned it all. So unless Cersei knew about the relationship, it would have taken Shae volunteering the info.
Â 
I think book-Shae wanted to become Tyrion's wife or concubine (like Ellaria to Oberyn), but I doubt she really loved him. She seemed to enjoy the status and the comfort it brought, but the rest of the relation seems to have been mostly an act (as he was paying her to do anyway).Â 
Â 
Show Shae is a different matter; since she was explicitly ratted out she may well have been threatened into testifying.Â
1882	Uldra I	2014-05-15	ok... just gotta come out of the closet and say it.Â Â 
Â 
Book!Shae and Show!Shae are ladder climbers.Â  This woman wants to go as high as she can, and won't let anything stop her.... including "love", as if she could understand what that is.
1883	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-15	Yes, the audience would get that painful feeling of proxy shame we all have if someone beloved does something stupid, ridiculous or evil, the Othello-feeling......If they had only talked when there was time........
Not that carmic feeling some may have if they choose to see things black and white: She had it coming.
All would be more conflicted, Shae's death would be more tragic, if Tyrion ever realizes what moved her at least partially it will be more devastating for him, no room for that cheap carmic relief because an antagonist dies by the hand of a protagonist, the emotion flat entertainment tries to sell us as Happy Ending.
Tyrion would be an example of a tragic hero in Greek tragedy, made guilty by desinformation.
But even as it is now, without further description of Shae's motives, that flat "she had it coming" is out of the question if watchers refrain from being judgemental before thinking. Shae is far more complicated than in the books. And the scene in Tywin's bedchamber will come, I am sure, and will offer more room for interpretation (and heavy forum fighting   ).
Btw, I have to get rid of a rant, not against the show but against the concept of Shae in the books, and that from me who is one of those simple minded hopeless book and show apologists who uncritically admire artistic achievements 
In the books Shae has from the beginning been shaped as cardboard stereotype of a whore. Already her name is only one letter away from "She" as some kind of female moral archetype. Shae was never supposed to have an identity, a story of her own, she has always been there to illuminate Tyrion's deep personal issues and delusions with his desire to be loved and respected. So she was morally one dimensional in the books. As reaction posters try to invent all evils from Tyrion's side against her like "he stole from her" and "he mistreated her" in order to give her at least some motivation, some story, some identity. This is imo more a sign of justified frustration with Martin's writing than a correct interpretation of what is in the books. There is nothing in the books. Nothing about Shae to give her any depth and this is exactly what makes me angry. I also have tried to write quasi-fanfic in these forums to explain and understand Shae's despicable behaviour at the trial......abused child who never learned empathy.....lower class girl who had to look after herself.... Yaddayadda....because I did not want to see the sex worker and woman demeaned.
But this was the result of a sad omission from Martin's side. Fleshing out Shae may have appeared an unnecessary filler since all was about Tyrion but it would not have been. Tyrion's characterization suffers from leaving Shae so very pale, a side effect the author underestimated imo. I write this as huge fan of book Tyrion as well as show Tyrion.
And the show tried to correct that with good reason, though maybe they have overdone it. Making her so dedicated in protecting Sansa gave them plot trouble by now. And Sansa had to be seriously implicated by Shae or by whomever, a hunted criminal totally dependent of Baelish, seen as capable of murdering again, a victim of negative propaganda.
Yes, the Butterfly Effect... But in that case it was the author and not the show who started it, sorry Mr. Martin.you know I must say we do not always agree on topic of tyrion but I 100% agree with you here, I think tyrion killing shae without realising she agreed to the trial to save his life would be very, very tragic and would also flesh out shae's chatacter better than the show, I always had trouble trying to write about shae because she isnt much of a character in her own right but she is in the show and this would make for a much darker and tragic dynamic than in the books.

1.
the action of hurting or harming someone in return for an injury or wrong suffered at their hands.

So Shae is getting even more revenge by sleeping with Tywin? Or is she getting revenge when Tyrion gets killed? Just because you think women are the only sex that some how can magically get revenge on some one with out them ever knowing about it doesn't make it true.
Â 

again, I must ask - what?

Ok I see
1889	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-15	Â 
Shae was forced to testify against Tyrion. And it undermines Tyrions character not to have noticed this.


Â 
Good. If Shae is "stupid" for not seeing through Tyrion's lies in 4x02, then Tyrion is "stupid" for not seeing through Shae's lies in 4x06. I've read an overwhelming amount of comments that just go along with whatever Tyrion does and it's really annoying.
Â 
I never believed in the "whitewash" concept, but his flawed moments (like being insecure and not even able to look at Shae when he breaks up with her) seem to get overlooked because he's "awesome" most of the time.
Â 
A lot is riding on this finale. I can see people cheering when Tyrion kills Shae. I'm reminded of The Walking Dead and people were happy with deaths just because characters were "annoying." I don't think that's good writing. You should only (kinda) cheer at villain deaths, like Joffrey or Ramsay.

1890	BurningCandle	2014-05-15	I'm glad they made Shae's motivation more than simple greed, here it seems alot more understandable, and tragic. She has no idea that he really loves her, she thinks it was all a sham, and she's out to avenge herself and do some ladder climbing because of what she views as the ultimate betrayal of her by Tyrion.
1891	Cubarey	2014-05-15	"Tyrion was going to die, Shae would already of had her revenge and if she is bonking Tywin on the night before Tyrions execution then the writers of the show have not only made Shae a maniac but a total sociopath aswell."
Â 
Shae was happy being with Tyrion because he was a Lannister, a rich powerful noble. What better sugar daddy can you have then Tywin not only the Hand of the King but the real power behind the throne. Shae was a mercenary whore all along in both books and TV. She betrays Tyrian not only because she was told to by Cersi/Tywin and to skewer Tyrian but also to advance in favor with Tywin which she obviously did as she ended up in his bed. She deserved to be strangled by Tyrian she betrayed him for fun and profit and deserved no other fate then what she got.

Â 
I'm not sure what you're trying to say.Â 
Â 
What i'm saying is in the book, Tyrion's speech at the end of the trial made sense because he knew Shae was just after his gold and she didn't care about him OR Sansa.
Â 
It doesn't make sense in the show, when they've constantly given proof that Shae does in fact care and love Tyrion and Sansa. Yes Shae is stupid for not seeing that Tyrion was just trying to protect her, that's in line with her book character, but not her show character. In season 2 she was sharp and now this season she is dumb and annoying? It doesn't make any sense.
So, in the show, for Tyrion not to see that Shae was doing exactly what he did to her in 4x02, does undermine his character, because above everything, Tyrion is smarter than that. Forget 'white-washing' it's not about that, Tyrion will still kill Shae with the necklace he gave her in season 3, it's just the reasons for it are a little less defined. Because I don't think Shae deserves to die for what she did in the show, but i guess we are yet to see what she'll say to Tyrion in the tower of the hand.
Â 
I think they just stuffed up, there was no avoiding Tyrion's trial speech..so they had to make it look like Shae betrayed him. To me, it looked like Shae was made to say the story Cersei invented, and then tried to distance herself from Tyrion by making him think she wanted to say those things. You can see the worried look on Shae's face when Tyrion demands a trial by combat, because she thought by making her testimony, Tyrion would be sent to the wall and live, now there's a chance he will die.
1893	Seneti	2014-05-15	Secondly, Tysha; now again remember we only know so much about Tysha as readers because she plays a far bigger part in book Tyrions thoughts, but our unsullied friends only actually know her name from one episode in season 1, and a few offhand refereances refering to her (can't remember myself if they actually say her name after season 1) show Tyrion has never actually spoke about her in any more detail since. Now I asked my brother (unsullied) the other day do you remember what happened to Tyrions first wife? He said what happened to her. I then said you don't remember her name by any chance I have seemed to forgot it? He was pretty convinced they never actually said her name.........now my brother is by no means a stupid guy, I love my brother to bits and whats more I forgive him because how in the hell is any unsullied suppose to remember a name given to them in season 1? Who has played no huge part in Tyrions charecter since and next season all he going to go on about is Tysha?


Â 
I am probably going to get crucified by the agency-fundamentalists for saying this, but even in the books, Tysha's name is of no importance. What IS important is that we remember what happened to her. Attentive viewers will remember Tyrion's conversation with Bronn and Shae as well as his father's spiteful comment on his first marriage. They might not remember the name, but they remember the story. And those who don't, will most likely get a recap of that first conversation before ep. 10, when Tyrion's wife will be reintroduced just when she becomes relevant to his character arc and the plot (read: through that last conversation between Jaime and Tyrion).
Â 
So, no, I don't think Shae will become Tyrion's Tysha (or be merged with her). They still have good opportunities to remind viewers of what they need to know.
Â 


ok... just gotta come out of the closet and say it.Â Â

Â 
Hey, thanks for the tip on how to quote -- and it's so simple!
Â 
I do see your point, and I know that most book readers will agree with you.Â  As I said in my first post, I came to the books after the first three seasons of the show, so my perspective is different.Â  I got to know Tyrion and Shae as real lovers, which is how they have been portrayed in the show from the start.Â  In the books, it's pretty clear she's a gold-digging whore who uses Tyrion for all she can.Â 
Â 
Yes, she's vengeful in her testimony, and she does tell them intimate things he told her.Â  She is angry, and she lashes out to hurt him -- and she wants him to KNOW that she's doing this to hurt him (when he askes her to "please stop," she glares at him and says, "I'm a whore, remember?"Â Â  That's exactly what he said to her when he dumped her -- he told her she's a whore and he can't have children or a life with a whore.Â 
Â 
The problem I have with the scenario is that the show made Tyrion the first betrayer -- even if he did it for a so-called "good reason" (to protect her), he cruelly hurt her, and in a way that would be very hard for her to forget.Â  So when she hurts him back, it's a bit difficult for me to accept that he's angry enough to KILL her.
Â 
I also don't believe that Tywin had sex with Shae.Â  I know that's what's suggested when Tyrion finds Shae in Tywin's bed (in the book, anyway), but it totally goes against Tyrin's character for him to have a whore in his room, much less a whore that has been sleeping with Tyrion.Â  I see Cersei's hand in this, and Varys's.
Â 
Finally, the fact that the show left out the part where Shae has sex with Tyrion among the dragon bones seems important.Â  That was a kind of betrayal that didn't seem coerced in the books -- she acted as though she really loved him, saying all the usual things to him ("my lion," "my giant of Lannister"), and suggesting they would still be together.Â  But it was all lies.Â  And then she testifies against him.Â 
Â 
You're probably right, and he probably will kill her.Â  But he shouldn't kill her.Â  It's wrong to kill her, even in Westeros.Â

Â 
The whole point is that Tywin was a massive hypocrite. As for being with Shae - perhaps it was his way to humiliate Tyrion? He blames him for Joanna's death.
Â 
Most of non book readers I know actually expressed the wish 'I hope Tyrion strangles that bitch!' after the trial scene alone so they are in for a treat in finale.
1897	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-05-16	Â 
And people just like to winge about people wingeing about 'nothing', whats your point?
Â :

My point is that if he doesn't kill Shae, complain all you guys like. I'll probably add my voice to the complaints my self. 
But the scene hasn't happened yet. And people are whinging as if it has and he didn't do it. 
I went back and read a thread about episode 1 of season 1. People still endlessly whinged even then, when the show was more or less using the book as a screen play.
1898	Fantasy Character	2014-05-16	I gotta say that everyone posting about how Shae deserves to be murdered for betraying Tyrion is wigging me out. (Those posting to the contrary reassure me. ) I keep thinking of this quote:
Â 
"Most men fear getting laughed at or humiliated by a romantic prospect while most women fear rape and death.â<U+0080><U+009D>Â 
â<U+0080><U+0095>Â Gavin de Becker,Â The Gift of Fear: Survival Signals That Protect Us from Violence
Â 
I think Shae's death is an important plot point. I was kind of shocked when I read it. I found it an intriguing part of Tyrion's character and part of his dark side. I *like* that there are things about Tyrion I admire and things I find disgusting. It makes his chapters an interesting read.
Â 
I think it should be in the show, but I don't think it should be a satisfying 'revenge' or 'death of a villain' or 'Sweet! Strangle that bitch!' moment.

1899	The Eunuch	2014-05-16	I don't think Shae is banging Tywin at all!Â  Not even in the books.Â  Something else is going on, and we don't know what it is yet.Â  But there's no way Tywin would bring Tyrion's whore into his chamber for any reason other than politics.Â  He would NOT have sex with her.Â  He's not the type.Â  Not only does it completely go against his character

Â 
Why, because politicians don't have sex? Do you think Tywin got 3 kids being a virgin? His political skills do not make him less a man. His reproaches against Tyrion were not that he went to whores, but that Tyrion didn't hide it and dishonored the family. That's this hypocrisy that made Tyrion mad at him.
Â 
Or, if you think Shae was there for political reasons, why was she on the bed? Why did she call Tywin "M'lord" like she did during her private moments with Tyrion?

The whole point is that Tywin was a massive hypocrite. As for being with Shae - perhaps it was his way to humiliate Tyrion? He blames him for Joanna's death.
Â 
Most of non book readers I know actually expressed the wish 'I hope Tyrion strangles that bitch!' after the trial scene alone so they are in for a treat in finale.


Â 
Whether or not Tywin had sex with Shae, why is she a "bitch"?Â  Even in the book (where she never loved Tyrion, and acted only as his paid whore), why is she any worse than Bronn?Â  Both of them sell their talents to the one with the gold to pay for them.Â  Both of them betrayed Tyrion when it suited their situation.
Â 
In the show, it's obvious that Shae truly loved Tyrion.Â  Her reasons for testifying against him aren't as obvious, but even if she did it because she was hurt and seeking revenge, why is she any more of a bitch than Tyrion is an asshole?Â  He hurt her in the worst possible way (telling her the one thing he knew would really hit home, that she was just a whore and he can't love a whore).Â  I don't get the hate against show-Shae, unless it's from book readers who knew book-Shae before they ever met show-Shae.
Â 
I have no idea why Shae was in Tywin's bed in the book -- I'm just not convinced he knew she was there, and I suspect a Cersei/Varys hand in it.Â  I'm not saying Tywin would never sleep with a whore, but to sleep with Tyrion's whore -- and to let her wear his Hand of King neclace -- just doesn't ring true to me.Â  But we'll see.Â

Â 
Either D or D said in a podcast about 4.06 that they intentionally built up the Shae character to be more sympathetic in the show than she was in the book.Â  He said they planned that long ago, just to heighten the impact of the trial scene.Â Â 
Â 
Neither bookÂ or show Tyrion was an asshole to Shae.Â  He loved her and wanted to protect her.Â  He tried to get her to go somewhere safe repeatedly, but she wouldn't do it.Â  He explained time and again why she couldn't just come to his bed, but she did it anyway.Â  I don't think Tyrion is to blame here unless you factor in that he should have shipped her off much sooner.

The reason Shae was naked, in Tywin's bed with the Golden Chain of the Hand around her neck is because she felt at home there, relaxed without a care, and waiting to give Tywin a nice juicy welcome back to his chambers.Â  Heck yeah they were having at it!Â  The fact that it seems soooo surprisingly unlike Tywin, is exactly the point!Â  Tywin is a hypocrite!Â  Also Shae with all her fake "I love you's" and "ooo...Â  my giant of Lannister"Â  bs hasÂ finally shown her to be the evil succubus she always was.Â  Shae gets NO sympathy from me. 
Â 
ps. Â kacunnin, sorry for being so harsh.Â  Not directed at you personally, but the Shae thing really pushed all my buttons in the last show, and I'm really sick of all the Shae apologists' remarks.Â  Guess, I should just switch topics.

1902	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-17	Â 
Hey, thanks for the tip on how to quote -- and it's so simple!
Â 
I do see your point, and I know that most book readers will agree with you.Â  As I said in my first post, I came to the books after the first three seasons of the show, so my perspective is different.Â  I got to know Tyrion and Shae as real lovers, which is how they have been portrayed in the show from the start.Â  In the books, it's pretty clear she's a gold-digging whore who uses Tyrion for all she can.Â 
Â 
Yes, she's vengeful in her testimony, and she does tell them intimate things he told her.Â  She is angry, and she lashes out to hurt him -- and she wants him to KNOW that she's doing this to hurt him (when he askes her to "please stop," she glares at him and says, "I'm a whore, remember?"Â Â  That's exactly what he said to her when he dumped her -- he told her she's a whore and he can't have children or a life with a whore.Â 
Â 
The problem I have with the scenario is that the show made Tyrion the first betrayer -- even if he did it for a so-called "good reason" (to protect her), he cruelly hurt her, and in a way that would be very hard for her to forget.Â  So when she hurts him back, it's a bit difficult for me to accept that he's angry enough to KILL her.
Â 
I also don't believe that Tywin had sex with Shae.Â  I know that's what's suggested when Tyrion finds Shae in Tywin's bed (in the book, anyway), but it totally goes against Tyrin's character for him to have a whore in his room, much less a whore that has been sleeping with Tyrion.Â  I see Cersei's hand in this, and Varys's.
Â 
Finally, the fact that the show left out the part where Shae has sex with Tyrion among the dragon bones seems important.Â  That was a kind of betrayal that didn't seem coerced in the books -- she acted as though she really loved him, saying all the usual things to him ("my lion," "my giant of Lannister"), and suggesting they would still be together.Â  But it was all lies.Â  And then she testifies against him.Â 
Â 
You're probably right, and he probably will kill her.Â  But he shouldn't kill her.Â  It's wrong to kill her, even in Westeros.Â It was wrong to kill her in the books too but he does anyway. Tyrion doesnt have to be 100 percent good, he ISNT 100% good we KNOW this. He shouldnt kill her but he has to. Its a big part of his descent.
1903	Le Cygne	2014-05-17	I gotta say that everyone posting about how Shae deserves to be murdered for betraying Tyrion is wigging me out. (Those posting to the contrary reassure me. ) I keep thinking of this quote:Â "Most men fear getting laughed at or humiliated by a romantic prospect while most women fear rape and death.â<U+0080><U+009D>Â â<U+0080><U+0095>Â Gavin de Becker,Â The Gift of Fear: Survival Signals That Protect Us from ViolenceAh, that's where the quote came from, I heard that before. Yeah, doesn't really matter what she did or did not do, we're talking murder here.
1904	sati	2014-05-17	Â 
Whether or not Tywin had sex with Shae, why is she a "bitch"?Â  Even in the book (where she never loved Tyrion, and acted only as his paid whore), why is she any worse than Bronn?Â  Both of them sell their talents to the one with the gold to pay for them.Â  Both of them betrayed Tyrion when it suited their situation.

Why on Earth are you asking me about non book readers' reactions I mentioned? Though I do think she is a bitch, indeed. A woman who sleeps with her ex lover father? That's cold. And I have Cersei in my avatar.
Â 
Tyrion lied to her to save her life. She had sex with his father to hurt him. Do I need to say more?
1905	kacunnin	2014-05-17	It was wrong to kill her in the books too but he does anyway. Tyrion doesnt have to be 100 percent good, he ISNT 100% good we KNOW this. He shouldnt kill her but he has to. Its a big part of his descent.


Â 
I totally agree with this -- it was wrong of Tyrion to kill Shae in the books, but it's important to his character.Â  He's not a saint, and he doesn't always do the right thing.Â  And I think it will important to whatever happens down the road.
Â 
I'm just not sure how the TV show will handle this, since they need Tyrion to be the hero character they've created for him.Â  But we'll see.Â
1906	kacunnin	2014-05-17	Why on Earth are you asking me about non book readers' reactions I mentioned? Though I do think she is a bitch, indeed. A woman who sleeps with her ex lover father? That's cold. And I have Cersei in my avatar.
Â

Â 
She had sex with his father (IF she did) because he paid her -- and because he would have killed her if she didn't.Â  Tyrion can't have it both ways.Â  If she's a whore, then she's a whore -- no fair calling her a bitch because she does what whores do.Â  And if she's his lover, then he treated her terribly -- and everyone knows how dangerous a woman scorned can be!
1907	kacunnin	2014-05-17	Â 
IMO Bronn is on the up and up... that is he has been honest about his intentions from the very beginning.Â  ShaeÂ  OtOH, has only worked continuously on Tyrion's affections, lying the whole time.Â  Like Tyrion, IÂ believed her feigned affection for him.Â  Guess since I've been used this way once, I'd have a special place in hell carved out just for the likes of her.Â  If you are going to fuck someone over to literal death in order to get ahead, at least give them the courtesy of a little forewarning.Â

Â 
So you believe that show-Shae never loved Tyrion -- I don't buy it.Â  They created scenes for her, scenes that weren't in the book and that made it very clear that she loved him.Â  She tried to get Tyrion to run away with her after he was wounded -- had he agreed, they would have been on their own, without his family money and support.Â  She also refused Varys's diamonds when he tried to get her to leave King's Landing -- why would she do that if she was only in it for the money?Â  And she said she loved Sansa, and would die for her.Â  These scenes were not part of the books, and it's clear that the Shae character created for the show is very different from the Shae character in the books.
Â 
Hey, none of this is personal.Â  I do think it makes a difference whether someone comes to Shae's character first through the books or through the TV show.Â  I get that the book readers are pissed off at her; I just don't see the same thing for the show-Shae.
1908	Rouge	2014-05-17	I find it so ridiculous when people say that Bronn betrayed Tyrion. No, he did not. Janos Slynt and Petyr Baelish betrayed Eddard Stark because they said they'd stand beside him and they ended up stabbing his company in the back. Had Bronn fought as the Throne's champion in Tyrion's trial by combat, it would have been a betrayal. Had he testified against Tyrion, it would have been a betrayal too. What ASOIAF Bronn did was simply to decline championing Tyrion, which would have been suicide against the Mountain. Their implied contract was that Tyrion would pay Bronn handsomely for his services and it was clear that Bronn fighting the Mountain That Rides would have been entirely rewardless for him, even if he won. Even if innocented, Tyrion's standing was pretty much done at that time. All Bronn did was to take the first door out which was the best deal he would have ever gotten in that situation. And he did that without injuring Tyrion or deceiving him.
Â 
Shae was a different story and did betray him because she didn't give a fuck about him (still talking about the books here), so her confession was a big feeling of disillusionment for Tyrion who was actually manipulated to believe that she cared very much for him. Then seeing her sleeping in the Hand's Bed was the straw that broke the camel's back. The way I see it, Tyrion strangled her in his moment of insanity because he wanted to reject the harsh truth by murdering its embodiment. It's a very, very odious moment that makes a spiteful monster of Tyrion.
Â 
I don't know how GoT will justify the murder, but I have a feeling that they will kind of miss the point. Maybe some dialogue will make it seem like Shae offered herself willingly to Tywin because she follows power wherever it goes. Something that will stain her character even more than it is right now. I'm very curious about it.
Â 
And they better make it obvious that Tywin was bedding Shae and that she wasn't there for "political affairs". Tywin's hypocrisy is one of his strongest character points. Many talk about hypocrisy, but it's even more than just that. It's Tyrion finding out about his father's inner demons. Tytos Lannister's mistress obviously had a traumatizing effect on his son. That's when you find out that Tywin has been a staunch and fervent hater of whores and men with mistresses because it was the part of himself that he couldn't chase away. We were never getting a scene where Tywin would breakdown in tears and empty his emotional bag, but this was the closest thing we got hinting that Tywin Lannister was a tortured person inside, just like his children.
Â 
Anyway, that Tyrion chapter is probably my favorite of the whole series. The first time I read ASoS, when I read it, I had to stop and reread it again. Then another time. It affected me even more than the Red Wedding and I thought nothing could beat that. I'm anxious to see how it will be done on the show. I've been anxious for quite some time. I expect it to be a great scene, but I think that it might not have the same meaning if they change the set up a bit, especially with Tyrion. I know that some people complain about the favorable treatment that Tyrion's character received from HBO, but all the white-washing will be forgiven so long as they don't sugarcoat this scene and that it marks a permanent change to Tyrion's character. If anything, it'll only make it more shocking for the Unsullied. I'm not too hopeful, but I'm very much looking forward to the episode and the reactions.

...
Actually, I believed show and bookÂ Shae loved Tyrion.Â Â But in the books I always suspected she loved himÂ until a better opportunity appeared.Â  The very idea that she did at least care for him and then turned on him is what is so upsetting to me because she knew exactly how devastated Tyrion would be.Â  I'm really starting to believe I'm overreacting and thatÂ my reaction must be tied to some psychological aspect of myself.Â  Thanks for listening to that, and apologies for saying too much.Â Â BTW also agree that book and show Shae are two different critters (please excuse my southern accent Â ).

Â 
can't wait either.Â  a lot of people think they will throw out the murder scene all together.Â  My money is on its inclusion, grit and all, by the end of this season.

1910	voodooqueen126	2014-05-17	Yes, the audience would get that painful feeling of proxy shame we all have if someone beloved does something stupid, ridiculous or evil, the Othello-feeling......If they had only talked when there was time........
Not that carmic feeling some may have if they choose to see things black and white: She had it coming.
All would be more conflicted, Shae's death would be more tragic, if Tyrion ever realizes what moved her at least partially it will be more devastating for him, no room for that cheap carmic relief because an antagonist dies by the hand of a protagonist, the emotion flat entertainment tries to sell us as Happy Ending.
Tyrion would be an example of a tragic hero in Greek tragedy, made guilty by desinformation.
But even as it is now, without further description of Shae's motives, that flat "she had it coming" is out of the question if watchers refrain from being judgemental before thinking. Shae is far more complicated than in the books. And the scene in Tywin's bedchamber will come, I am sure, and will offer more room for interpretation (and heavy forum fighting  ).
Btw, I have to get rid of a rant, not against the show but against the concept of Shae in the books, and that from me who is one of those simple minded hopeless book and show apologists who uncritically admire artistic achievements 
In the books Shae has from the beginning been shaped as cardboard stereotype of a whore. Already her name is only one letter away from "She" as some kind of female moral archetype. Shae was never supposed to have an identity, a story of her own, she has always been there to illuminate Tyrion's deep personal issues and delusions with his desire to be loved and respected. So she was morally one dimensional in the books. As reaction posters try to invent all evils from Tyrion's side against her like "he stole from her" and "he mistreated her" in order to give her at least some motivation, some story, some identity. This is imo more a sign of justified frustration with Martin's writing than a correct interpretation of what is in the books. There is nothing in the books. Nothing about Shae to give her any depth and this is exactly what makes me angry. I also have tried to write quasi-fanfic in these forums to explain and understand Shae's despicable behaviour at the trial......abused child who never learned empathy.....lower class girl who had to look after herself.... Yaddayadda....because I did not want to see the sex worker and woman demeaned.
But this was the result of a sad omission from Martin's side. Fleshing out Shae may have appeared an unnecessary filler since all was about Tyrion but it would not have been. Tyrion's characterization suffers from leaving Shae so very pale, a side effect the author underestimated imo. I write this as huge fan of book Tyrion as well as show Tyrion.
And the show tried to correct that with good reason, though maybe they have overdone it. Making her so dedicated in protecting Sansa gave them plot trouble by now. And Sansa had to be seriously implicated by Shae or by whomever, a hunted criminal totally dependent of Baelish, seen as capable of murdering again, a victim of negative propaganda.
Yes, the Butterfly Effect... But in that case it was the author and not the show who started it, sorry Mr. Martin.


Please write that fanfiction. It would be well worth reading.Â

Yes, she did. You're making an assumption. She could have found herself a lord other than Tywin. I don't think Tyrion would have killed her if she did that with someone different than his father. It is that final humiliation that cost Shae her life.
1912	HairGrowsBack	2014-05-18	^Honestly, I don't think she had much choice in the matter. The Lannisters pretty much had her as "Tyrion's whore", no way she was going to walk out of this easily, and even if she could, I can't really blame her for choosing Tywin's bed instead of possible death/ being back in war-devastated Westeros.

What a good post!
That hugely interesting character of Tyrion should not be diluted by any reduction of  the impact that powerful chapter has on his personality and his plot development.
1914	kacunnin	2014-05-18	Such an interesting discussion!Â  And it's really not an easy situation to unravel.Â  The HBO version of Game of Thrones has made a soap-opera-style romance out of Tyrion and Shae's relationship, and it's going to be very interesting to see how they twist that romance into the shocking double-murder we get in the books.Â 
Â 
My gut reaction when I got to that scene in book 3 was to say, "This will NEVER happen on the show."Â  I just couldn't believe that show-Tyrion would ever kill a woman he loved.Â  But I agree that book-Tyrion's character changes greatly after he kills Shae and Tywin, and if the show plans to head in that same direction, something major needs to happen, something that will haunt him forever.Â  Killing Shae in a fit of rage might get us (and him) there.Â  But he's not going to be the "good guy" anymore.Â 
Â 
If the show plans to stick with the soap-opera-style romance thing for Tyrion, then he won't kill Shae.Â  Someone else might (Tywin, perhaps), which could further fuel Tyrion's rage against his father.Â  But Tyrion won't do it himself.Â  But if the show plans to get Tyrion's character back to where it is in the last two books, then he will kill Shae.Â 
Â 
Like many of you, I'm excited to see how it will play out.Â  And whatever happens, it will be a development that shakes up the series and gets all of us talking.Â  But I don't hate show-Shae.Â  I don't think she's a bitch.Â  And I don't think killing her would be justice in any shape or form.Â
1915	Woman of War	2014-05-18	Please write that fanfiction. It would be well worth reading.
Actually I would love to. I think a female commoner "smallfolk" POV character is something the books are missing. Some posters said with good resaon that it is not the smallfolk characters who shape history, who drive the plot, who have the insight and understanding to give us main plot milestones. And yet I miss their viewpoint.
I am not a big friend of true fanfiction outside of developing plot crackpots for forum debate since it is the author's and not my right to shape his own artistic creation but the topic above  would be tempting. Only I have never written one word of fiction since puberty, and for sure not in a foreign language.
1916	OccupyHarrenhal	2014-05-18	I was very glad they had her in the trial, I feared they might not. I think she will die in ep 10 (Hope so). Shae of season 3 / 4 has been mostly whining and nagging and not so nice. I think this is preparing the audience for her death.


Â 
When has anyone ever died in episode 10? Episode 8 is called "The Mountain and The Viper,"Â I'll give you one guess as to what happens in that episode. And then Tyrion's escape will be Episode 9.Â
1917	Woman of War	2014-05-18	I read somewhere that ep 9 will be without Dinklage

A few years ago I did a unit on Indian Epics. (Ramayana and the Mahabharata) and there is basically a whole lot of fanfiction of those ur texts (ie a Jain version*, even the translations from Sanskrit into assorted Indian vernaculars such as Tamil, or plays based on smaller incidents in the text-such as Kalidasa's "The Recognition of Shakuntala"...The Thai version of the Ramayana seems to be very different with Hanuman being transformed from a celibate bachelor (Sanskrit) into a womaniser (Thai), plus all those Balinese dance versions... So some of the great works of Eastern Literature are actually fanfiction of these two great texts.
The point is, fanfiction is nothing to be ashamed of.
Â 
So if you're feeling under confident, spend a month or more reading the best of German literature (the only ones I know about are Heine, Kleist, Goethe, Remarque, Â Hesse**) then write the story in German. Then find a native English speaker to who reads German to help you translate.
Â

*Sita is Ravana's daughter in this version
**I started reading a translation of Steppenwolf in a bookstore, and quickly came to the conclusion that the author was crazy.
1920	Woman of War	2014-05-18	Not a bad advice but I still think if I felt like writing fiction I would write my very own book. Actually there is a difference if you write an epic novel based on traditional or historical mythology, moving within the archetypes of a certain cultural background or if you write fanfic based on a living author's creation, something he or she would like to continue and expand him- or herself. 
Edit: quite a bit off topic

I read somewhere that ep 9 will be without Dinklage 


Â 
Apparently so, I hadn't heard that before now, but apparently the entire episode synopsis is just "Jon Snow and the Night's Watch faces a big challenge."Â
1922	King Tyrion I	2014-05-20	I read somewhere that ep 9 will be without Dinklage 


Â 
IMDb lists him for ep 9.
Â 
Perhaps they inserted a little scene in the dungeon - just before something else happens in ep 10. Because Charles and Peter are listed for ep 10.
1923	We Pay Our Debts	2014-05-20	Â 
I read somewhere, that even the actress playing Shae Sibel Kekilli wanted to have the part of her testimony removed, where she blamed Sansa.


Â 
http://www.zap2it.co...y_sansa-2014-05
Â 
This actually gave me some respect for her, because she at least tries to argue with the writers about their bullshit decisions.
1924	Arya'sSanctuary	2014-05-20	The whole character of Shae is changed IMHO from book to show. In the show she is sympathetic throughout. Even her testimony is shown to be born from hurt that tyrion "chose" Sansa over her, whereas in the book, when she finds out about the marriage she says to tyrion "so you'll put a baby in her belly and then come back to me" and T. Is hurt that she wasn't a bit jealous. It sets up the true betrayal of T. finding out that Shae DIDN'T love him and tysha (?i think that's his first wife's name) really did, setting up the journey he takes from that point. It's going to be a klutzy transition that the show's writers will probably handle in their usual way, with further deviations.
1925	MegaTechPC	2014-05-21	There's a very simple reason why they didn't show Cersei threatening Shae into testifying against Tyrion and that uis because it would have ruined the surprise to the viewers when they called her to the stand which was the big payoff of the episode...
1926	The King Of Cooked Steak	2014-05-11	I highly anticipated this scene, and not only did it meet my expectations, but it exceeded them. I got that feeling when I was reading aSoS again. I was shivering when I read that chapter in the book, and I was shivering when I saw the scene. I might be overexaggerating, but it was that damn good. My feelings of unfairness and unlawfulness were exactly the same as the feelings the character had. Of course, it would not have been as good if it was for Peter Dinklage's AMAZING performance. Seriously, if he doesn't get an Emmy this year, I'll flip out and call BS on the voting.
Â 
How were you feeling when you saw it?
1927	Obebb	2014-05-13	Felt the same as OP. It was awesome and very well done. It was exactly as I imagined it when reading. A tiny bit of me kept hoping Taena Merryweather would pop up out of nowhere but I'm used to that disappointmentÂ   . I loved the trial regardless.

1929	Thick as a Castle Wall	2014-05-13	I loved the scene! I had been looking forward to that scene, because I got this ominous feeling in my gut when I read it. They totally recreated that feeling here, I think.

1930	Panther2000	2014-05-13	Loved it,Â  I said it in another thread but will say it again.Â Â Â Â  Like the Red Wedding, I was unable to sleepÂ  Sunday night.
Â 
I am a book reader & knew what was coming however,Â  it still disturbed me like crazy.Â  Peter D, IS amazing.Â Â Â Â 
Â 
What I saw on my 2nd view was when, Vary's & PO were talking prior to the trail.Â  PO was asking vary's about his story, where he came from.Â  Varys said that he only tells people who he trusts, then he looks overÂ  the Defendant's box where tyrion will be standing( because, he only told tyrion the story of his abuser).Â  That is what I got from Vary's when he told tyrion at the trail that he never forgets.Â Â Â Â  I think that Vary's really likes tyrion & knows that he could do good for The country but he can't help him with out putting his own life at risk.Â Â 
Â 
This show was amazing,Â Â Â  what pissed me off was that there was 10 min left.Â Â Â Â  I think that it would have been even better if they did the 1st half on Theon/Yara & Ramsay and the 2n half hour on the trail.Â Â Â Â Â Â
1931	King Tyrion I	2014-05-13	I absolutely loved it.
Â 
Peter and Charles did both an awesome job and nailed their parts with bravour. Every mimic, every gesture - everything in the end. Every word of it.
Â 
The setup was brilliant.
Â 
Like I said in another thread, I'm kind of torn with my sympathies - I really like Tyrion, but I also like Tywin.

Lannister fan to the last.

It was really nice to see the motto of their house - in this trial. Because both kept snarling, growling - shouting. And roared.

That is the feeling I got as well. Â It was very powerful IMO.
1933	Charlie Of House Bucket	2014-05-13	I liked it.Â  It didn't look anything like the room I was envisioning when I read the book, but this happens quite a bit on this show; I should be rather more amazed at how often they fairly well match the images my mind paints.Â  Braavos was incredible, for instance - the spitting image of my mind's eye.
Â 
I'm very much a fence sitter on how Tyrion was portrayed in this one.Â  On the one hand I pictured a nobler and quieter dignity in the book during his closing "I've been on trial my whole life" speech through even the most vituperative wording - but on the other, drama in such a scene needs more tension, power, and emotion, and what I pictured would have been flat as a pancake on screen, so Hodor.Â  Dinklage is a superb actor.
1934	direwoofwoof	2014-05-13	It was awesome. Jaime and Tyrian stole the scene, IMHO. Cersei was unbelievable, Pycelle was sickening, Varys surprising, Shae annoying, and Tywin was his usual a-hole self. It was just an amazing scene with all the players doing what we thought (and knew) they would do in ways that just made me mad and sad all at the same time. I am so glad I know what happens to most of these people!
1935	Makaroth	2014-05-13	I really loved the scene especially when he demanded a trial by combat and you could see Tywin's reaction. What did you guys see from it? I actually felt it was Tywin realising that Tyrion was his son but that was just my take on it.
1936	Envie	2014-05-13	I was fascinated by Dinklage's acting.

Â 
This. I've already discussed in a lot of detail Peter's acting in the other thread about the scene but I'd also like to add that Tywin's acting was spot on perfect. I loved the line where he jokingly and casually dismisses Tyrion's remark that he's guilty of being a dwarf with the famous line: "You're not on trial for being a dwarf..." it was PERFECT on Charle's acting part.Â 
Â 
At the end of that scene, the look between Tywin and Tyrion could have cut through steel. It was intense!
1937	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-13	I was fascinated by Dinklage's acting.

That stare between them at the end was fantastic!
1938	protar	2014-05-13	It was pretty great. Superb acting from all, especially Dinklage who deserves an emmy or something for this scene alone. Sometimes the guy's accent can grate on me and take me out the moment, but there were no such problems this episode. And, may I say Tyrion looked rather devilishly handsome in that final shot of him.

Â 
Â 
If anything, I thought there would be more anger in his speech after reading it in the books, whereas as Dinklage had more of a hissing tone. It still worked for me as he and Dance were on top form as usual.
1941	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-13	I liked the venom behind his words, I can see now we are going to see Tyrion go fall spiral downhill.
1942	Hodor's Dragon	2014-05-13	I was stunned by it, not because there was anything surprising in the scene, but just because of how damned good it was. Â I don't think I moved a finger for about 5 minutes.
Â 
Anyone who stepped in between Tywin and Tyrion during The Stare would've instantly disappeared in a puff of smoke!
1943	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-13	Powerful television.
1944	CaptainTheo	2014-05-13	Just as when reading the book, it made me feel an overwhelming sense of injustice for poor Tyrion, as it should have. It didn't totally grab me until the end, when Shae came into testify and Tyrion ended up exploding. Dinklage was awesome.
1945	harokin	2014-05-13	Still had goosebumps 15 minutes after the show ended. Alongside the betrayal of Ned probably the most powerful non-death scene in the series so far.
1946	acosta	2014-05-13	Unfortunately, I can no longer see Pycelle without realizing he's the Nazi archaeologist from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. As long as he isn't on screen, I'm good, though.Â
1947	Mad Monkey	2014-05-13	Top-notch performances by all performers. Even the extras and non-speaking characters looked like they were "on" the whole time.I definitely think that if Tyrion had gone to verdict he could have been acquitted. The prosecution's case didn't really make any sense. They overreached by trying for the conspiracy charge with Sansa; if Tyrion had poisoned Joffrey in a fit of spontaneous anger during the wedding, it would have made sense. But the idea that he drugged the wine and then just stood there knowing that he was guaranteed to be arrested and put to death doesn't make any sense and I think that Oberyn and Tywin at least would have seen that.
1948	Dreams and Prophecies	2014-05-13	i am having a hard time believing that people actually believe Sansa killed Dontos with a crossbow.Â

Â 
Ya, I figured someone would say this.Â  But it's a very short speech in the book - much, much shorter than show version.Â  There are no moments of "he shouted," no description of outward anger, and no exclamation points; it's all "...he said," very rational as I read it, until the moment when he demands trial by combat, which is in italics and has the exclamation point (and which, funny enough, in show version he states rather plainly).Â 
Â 
I see Tyrion as a person whose sole claim to superiority over these people is his wits, and I don't think of him as outwardly very emotional, even if he is seething inside.Â  Books vs film/theatre/TV though:Â  Again, stage drama needs this precisely because the audience doesn't get to see what's going on inside, whereas books allow us to interpret characters in ways that aren't over dramatized - that is to say, because not everyone is.Â

He's also General Veers from The Empire Strikes Back.
1951	Mad Monkey	2014-05-13	i am having a hard time believing that people actually believe Sansa killed Dontos with a crossbow.If questioned, Cersei will probably find a witness that says that Joffrey and Sansa went hunting in the Kingswood many times and that he showed her how to use it. He even had a new type of crossbow with a special crank that made it much easier to load for a girl. The beauty of perjury is that you aren't constrained by anything other than your own imagination. If one of your lies stops making sense, just make up a couple more to keep it company.

Â 
Â 
Tyrion was on a tear alright, he ditched the wit that has been both shield and weapon for so long, and bared his claws and snarled and roared. Â And the old lion took notice, and was both furious and surprised. Â No more deference from Tyrion, no more hope of approval, he was challenging Tywin with everything he had. Â We haven't really seen Tyrion enraged before, at least not such a deep, dark, personal rage.
Â 
It was marvelous. Â 
Â 
I remember that the scene that really showcased Dinklage's skill the most in Season 1 (in my opinion) was the one between him and Dance, when Tywin told Tyrion he was sending him to King's Landing as the acting Hand of the King, because "you're my son" - Dinklage conveyed their relationship so perfectly, with just a flash of emotion on his face, hesitation yielding to hope and an almost disbelieving joy that his father was finally giving him a chance to prove his worth big-time, that his father trusted him. Â 
Â 
And in this scene, all that goes to hell; that brief moment of trust is gone and it's war. Â 
Â 
I wish that Charles Dance could get an Emmy for his role in this show as well...
1955	Koi No Yokan	2014-05-14	It's certainly up there as one of the best episode endings in the show; even better than the closing shot of Season 2's finale, in my opinion.
Â 
Dinklage and Dance were great (of course), but you have to give it up for the rest of the supporting cast in the room also - Nikolaj and Lena's restrained frustration and sadness, Pascal's amusement at the entire affair and his interest at Tyrion's demand, Dormer's "These people really are fucking insane" expression... even Kekilli stepped it up with her mixture of regret, fear, and hurt at Tyrion.
Â 
Fantastic scene, very happy with the end result.
1956	Batman	2014-05-14	I felt like it dragged for a little while when they put all of the evidence against Tyrion. I know it was needed to get across the point that it was not a fair trial, but it just felt like it dragged on.
Â 
The second half more than made up for that however. "I should have let Stannis kill you all" was such a fantastic moment.

1957	Knight of Ashes	2014-05-14	Made up immensely for the rest of the ep (but not the season so far). All the Lannisters were riveting to watch right from Jaime closing his eyes as Tyrion demanded trial by combat to the self-satisfied look on Cersei's face and the glaring contest between Tywin and Tyrion.
I also wouldn't mind Margaery stating her (true) thoughts about the trial at some point.
One thing though, as with the book, I have a hard time believing that Kingslanders weren't happy that Joffrey's dead and at least some of them weren't proclaiming Tyrion a hero. I know that may be dangerous but that are always some foolhardy enough to risk such things. And whIle it made for a great dramatic moment, particularly on tv, I've always thought Martin overstated how reprehensible the people of King's Landing are and how far they were willing to blame Tyrion for their troubles.

When Jaime asked so very kindly and seriously "Do you trust me?"  and Tyrion looked up to him and, full of trust and confindence, said "yes". This was heartbreaking, loving, the little brother to the older one, counting on him to chase the bullies away.
And the next moment Tyrion's  look to Tywin, full of suspicion.

Â 
You have to remember those in the throne room for this mock 'trial' were all nobles or related to the court / castle in some way and so they absolutely must be bought in 100% (even if fake) to the Lannisters and that means to Tywin as the defacto ruler and Cersei as the Dowager Queen. Speaking out against them would be treasonous and so of course they are all too willing to blame Tyrion. These are the same idiots who were at the wedding, enjoying the crown's coin in wine and food while watching Joffrey be a total ass just before he died. They witnessed the whole thing and stood around like the sheep that they are. Despicable but not a one of them has any power to speak out against the true evil.Â 
Â 
I imagine among the small-folk there's a bit more appreciation for Tyrion and a lot more hatred for Joffrey - they did riot and throw shit at him in the streets remember.Â 
Â 
It's the toadies of court who are 'bought and paid for' which isn't an uncommon theme in many historical royal courts.
1960	Tears of Lys	2014-05-14	I thought it was a great scene and wonderfully well-played, as stated many times upthread.The one thing I didn't quite take from the books, which was made abundantly clear here was how Tywin was using the threat of Tyrion's execution against Jaime to put Jaime in the position of having to come to him and beg for his brother's life. Exactly what Tywin wanted, when you think about it. It allowed Tywin to set the conditions, which of course were that Jaime quit the Kingsguard and take his rightful place at Casterly Rock and AWAY from Cersei.Does anyone else remember this point being made in the book(s)?

Not everybody only those with power or those who want power small folk probably know and hated Joffrey with a passion the soldiers who fought also know and they were witness to Joffreys cowardice when he left the battlements. None of those two faction were brought in court only those nobles and lords bought and paid by Lannisters who will speak ill of him simply cause tywin says so

1964	Mad Monkey	2014-05-14	No one will sympathize with Tyrion in open court. In the books there was one man who praises Tyrion during his testimony and it was ignored; in fact, Cersei uses that to damn Tyrion further, saying that even someone who admires Tyrion personally is giving evidence of his guilt.
1965	OnlyOne	2014-05-14	The more Lannisters that die, the better. Clearly Tyrion will be around to the end and that's fine with me:-)
1966	ToTheWolves	2014-05-14	Don't forget about Nikolai he was great in this also.
1967	Miss Carnahan	2014-05-14	First time since Blackwater that I was really impressed by an episode. The first half was okay, but the trial was incredible. After the episode had ended, I seemed to be on a high just because of that last scene. I usually never rewatch a scene and I've watched it at least 5 times by now.
1968	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-14	I thought it was a great scene and wonderfully well-played, as stated many times upthread.

1969	Knight of Ashes	2014-05-14	@ Envie (can't paste quotes for some reason)
Â 
Yeah, I accept what you said about the people at court but I could do with at least a whiff of people acknowledging what Tyrion did at the Blackwater. I'm sure there where surviving knights and soldiers who saw what he did and at least a tale of this would have got out. Like how many times does a dwarf lead a sortie?

That you and I have to imagine a bit of appreciation from the smallfolk supports what I'm saying, I think.
1970	Uldra I	2014-05-14	Not sure if anyone has posted this yet.Â  It's a link to HBO cast & crew discussing the trial.Â Â  It seems to me they met all their goalsÂ from what viewers in the forums have expressed in reaction.

Â 
That's a good inside analysis of the scene. I appreciated hearing from both writers, the director and Bryan Cogman as well - because between the four of them, they had to make this scene believable because it was such a crucial turning point in the books not just for Tyrion but many characters in King's Landing. The series of events which unfolds after this trial are huge and monumental. They couldn't screw this scene up and I'm so pleased they nailed it so perfectly.
1972	TheNorth's1stKnight	2014-05-14	epic dinklage killed it
1973	Bowen	2014-05-14	I thought it was a great scene and wonderfully well-played, as stated many times upthread.The one thing I didn't quite take from the books, which was made abundantly clear here was how Tywin was using the threat of Tyrion's execution against Jaime to put Jaime in the position of having to come to him and beg for his brother's life. Exactly what Tywin wanted, when you think about it. It allowed Tywin to set the conditions, which of course were that Jaime quit the Kingsguard and take his rightful place at Casterly Rock and AWAY from Cersei.Does anyone else remember this point being made in the book(s)?No never went down like this in the books,it was Kevan who would of been talking to Tywin,infact I don't think Jamie even meets Tyrion until after the trial in Tyrions cell.
Great scene and amazing acting from Dinklage,it's like they gave him a script he could really get his teeth into.

1975	Bear Island	2014-05-15	I felt like Peter went a bit OTT with the snarling during the trial, but not so over the top that it detracted from the scene, which was quite excellent. I think that the addition of the deal between Jaime and Tywin was perfect. As an added bonus, it fit well with my headcanon that Tywin knows on some level that Tyrion is too smart to be behind the murder but it's just too good of an opportunity to stop Tyrion from ever being the Lord of Casterly Rock to pass up and thus Tywin smothers his doubts and goes ahead with it.
1976	mankytoes	2014-05-17	I thought it was great, not just because of Dinklage, but all the different characters. King's Landing scenes are always great because there's so much character interaction. Margaery, who usually looks calm and in control, looked really uncomfortable, knowing Tyrion is innocent. Pycelle's testimony was great as well, I love the vindictive old bastard.
1977	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-05-17	Loved the scene.
Â 
My only gripe is that Loras was asleep and only woke up at the end when the court was in uproar.
1978	WinterisAlwaysComing	2014-05-17	He's also General Veers from The Empire Strikes Back.


Â 
"We have the generators in sight, Lord Vader. Â You may commence your landing."
Â 
Every time I watch that, I think, "This guy had the BALLS to tell Vader he 'MAY' do something??"
1979	the ghost of nedart	2014-05-18	Fucking love this show...feel like I'm in another life when I'm watching it
1980	OccupyHarrenhal	2014-05-18	Still had goosebumps 15 minutes after the show ended. Alongside the betrayal of Ned probably the most powerful non-death scene in the series so far.


Â 
The trial and Ned's arrest are my favorite non-death scenes, along with Stannis and Renly's "negotiation."
1981	jakmanuk	2014-05-18	He's also General Veers from The Empire Strikes Back.


He's also Aragog, the giant spider from harry potter and the chamber of secrets
1982	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-18	Oh my god he is isnt he, hahaha wow

I had a mock "General Veers For President" Campaign with shirts and stuff back in 2004. The slogan was "The Only Competent Leader in the Galactic Empire" and included qualifications such as his skill in putting down insurgencies as demonstrated on Hoth (we were knee deep inputting down an Iraqi uprising at the time).Â
1984	Matthew Marzolf	2014-05-21	I think an important point this episode makes is that when they lift the dialog from the book, it's pure gold and when they think they know better than GRRM they're kidding themselves.
1985	MegaTechPC	2014-05-21	Peter's work in this episode is some of the finest acting ever done on the small screen in my opinion. Â I also really loved Charles Dance's scene in season one when he is talking to Nikolaj while cleaning an actual deer! Â That is some mighty fine acting right there and its all of the incredible acting talent that truly make this show the best on television...
1986	MegaTechPC	2014-05-21	I almost forgot, there is one performer that I have never liked and continue to dislike in this episode: Â Shae. Â I can't stand that actress and what she did to the Shae role. Â Not sure if its her or how the writers wrote her but she is just totally different than in the book and not in a good way in my opinion.
1987	Frey Pies	2014-05-12	Does anyone else think she was very good this episode? I thought did a great job when talking to the goat herder and, the more sympathetic tone she gradually took on when talking to Hizdahr after being loathsome initially was great.
1988	Nymeria Stone	2014-05-12	Yes, I agree. I liked how Dany looked very troubled and sad by what Hizdhar and the goat herder said, but she still tried to keep her serious Queen face on.
Emilia's performance has been improving more and more. She did great on season 3 and this season seems even more promising. She and Kit are really showing what they can do.
1989	Dragon Queen	2014-05-12	I liked how young she looked when she smiled at the goat guy and told him he'd get 3x the value of the goats. She seemed like a younger girl, and it's a nice reminder that she's not quite all grown up even if she is Queen.

Her Valyrian dialogue also tends toÂ up her attractiveness and acting quality too.
1990	GSF_Grrrl	2014-05-12	She was flawless! *thumbs up*
1991	Florina Laufeyson	2014-05-12	She was alright, yeah. Her wooden delivery to Hizdahr was cool cuz it showed she was feeling some self-doubt about the situation. That, and showing how Dany cant just proclaim things with this lot. Her petulance was nice when speaking to Hizdahr and it shows how arrogant Dany had been and how Hizdahr's words sorta brought her back to reality. Her "How many more??" at Missandei and Missandei responds with a huge number and her face is like: "seriously?..." Missandei's annoyed tone of "Yes, Your Grace." was really awesome too. Seems like the M-gal is like "ok, you bought this pig, you arent gonna bother feeding it?"
1992	LordStoneheart	2014-05-12	the "falseness" people have been complaining about seems to be fading here. With the goatherd she was "wearing her Queen armor" so to speak, but it started to break when Hizdahr gave his tearjerking performance. I thought she was amazing.Â
1993	Cyril	2014-05-12	Better than last episode, surely.Â  Though she completely and utterly overdid the annoyance in both her face and voice in the one line where she makes Hizdahr speak for himself.Â  It was almost comical.

1994	~DarkHorse~	2014-05-12	I thought she did great at showing her Vulnerability. It really echoed her Season 1 performances but flickered to her Season 3 'badass' portrayal as well. I hope we see more of this!
1995	Skagosi High Chef	2014-05-12	I love her, I do. I couldn't fathom another playing the part, but, at times this season she has come off as a little smug to me.
1996	Asshai by the Shadow	2014-05-12	Emilia's performance was very good. She got told by Hizhdar..for a second i was afraid she was going to refuse his father's burial to which the Khaleesi-loving simpletons would be heartbroken to realize she ain't all that.
1997	jarl the climber	2014-05-12	Does anyone else think she was very good this episode? I thought did a great job when talking to the goat herder and, the more sympathetic tone she gradually took on when talking to Hizdahr after being loathsome initially was great.


Yeah shes doing the best she can with the material shes getting and the whole Essosi storyline hasn't been that great and she seems to take the blame for it for some reason and its not really that fair to her. Hopefully they can do a good job with the Jorah betrayal reveal but more importantly they need to start establish the granddaughter/grandfather relationship she had with Barristan in the books which became very critical in the books when she disappeared, people sort of turned to him because he was the closest thing she had to family. Beyond fleshing out Mereen in general, they need to take her off the pyramid and let her be human, maybe she will lighten up after Daario finally bones her, it has been a couple of years for her, I guess anyone would be in a bad mood after that.
1998	I'm_Tim	2014-05-12	Her voice is the most annoying aspect of the show IMO.
1999	jarl the climber	2014-05-12	Her voice is the most annoying aspect of the show IMO.


I get a boner every time she has a line
2000	Lady of Dragonstone	2014-05-12	I love her too. It seemed like she's been off a bit the last couple episodes, but she was great this time. I loved her snideness towards Hizdahr and the emotion she showed during his tale. Too bad it was such a short scene.ETA
Â 
ETA: I think her voice is beautiful, but the Valyrian is very grating to me. I preferred the sound of Dothraki. Also, Hizdahr spoke the common tongue - perhaps trying to emphasize that he feels he is her equal in a way.

Â 
motion seconded.
2002	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-05-12	It was a step in the right direction for once.
2003	I'm_Tim	2014-05-12	She's obviously beautiful, but the pontificating/posh voice she's developed this season is just grating to me. I realize she's over-projecting confidence.
2004	Hodor's Dragon	2014-05-12	She's a very talented actress, but she has been saddled this season with the brunt of a poor decision by the show's producers/directors to take the brief amount of Dany time available (necessarily brief because nothing really happens with her story) and heavily emphasize "regal conqueror." Â Book Dany can do regal and conqueror but she can also be overcome by her emotions; she questions her own decisions incessantly and basically only has self-confidence when she absolutely must have it (another key to her character: she always steps up in the clutch).
Â 
That whole thread about her last week was absurd, in my opinion. Â She had about 30 seconds of screentime, including these melodramatic scripted turns back and forth and direction to speak in a haughty, regal tone - and really, it had to have been direction, if they didn't want haughty and regal they could've said so. Â How are you gonna take that kind of dreck and make it sing?
Â 
This week they finally interjected a little of that self-uncertainty that the character in the book thrives on, and Clarke nailed it. Â All she needed was a chance: she can handle this role so long as the directors handle handle their end.
Â 
A side question: am I the only one who thinks she is better-looking this year? Â I don't know whether it's makeup, better diet, or even plastic surgery, because I can't place what it is about her that looks better, but while she has always been a hot chick, this year she's frickin' ravishing. Â I had a personal theory last year that Emilia Clarke was hitting the sauce a little hard, based on her skin tone, especially around the hands, but I don't see any of those signs this year. Â That could explain it.

I'm not sure about the looking better part, but I thought the same to myself [about the partying] at the beginning of this new season, maybe because her gestures are just very pronounced and her bearing has changed a bit. They do say, confidence is sexy!

2006	Lord Damian	2014-05-12	She is showing her novice as a character by being a better actress. It was a better performance than her constant, chant like/nurse ratched "I am the blood of the dragon"...... She showed pitty.
2007	Kingpin	2014-05-12	I like her as an actress, but I don't like her character.Â

Â 
Here are some pictures of her from last year. Â Look how red her hands are. Â I'm no doctor, and maybe a real doctor could give you some better explanation, but I've known a few drunks and I associate hands like that with alcoholism.

Happy to see someone make this thread, too.
2010	Night'sQueen	2014-05-12	Thought this was going to be another thread hating on EC and I was prepared to get angry, lol. She's a very good actress and perfect in this role. But, she's sometimes a victim of very poor writing/directing just like Kit. She got to show her chops in this episode -- a welcome change from last week.

I was thinking ffs are we going to have an Emilia can't act thread every episode? Glad it wasn't that. I can't say I was impressed or disappointed with her this episode, she was just ok. The end of Breaker of Chains has still been her best scene since "Dracarys" imo.
2012	Batman	2014-05-13	She was a bit better this week. Particularly he stubborn refusal to accept that what she did was not justice. That was very good and very in line with the books and I liked it a lot.Â

2014	Mad Monkey	2014-05-13	There's, like, no way you can tell if someone is consuming less alcohol than normal by looking at a glamor photo of them. Let's be for real, I wouldn't even be confident stating what her skin color is from those photos while knowing the amount of airbrushing that companies use these days.
Â 
Same. I was thinking ffs are we going to have an Emilia can't act thread every episode? Glad it wasn't that. I can't say I was impressed or disappointed with her this episode, she was just ok. The end of Breaker of Chains has still been her best scene since "Dracarys" imo.
Â 
I think Clarke's acting will definitely pick up once they start giving her more roles like the one she had in this episode. For this entire season, all she's really had were monologues and stirring speeches. She did those well IMO but there's much more to Dany than that and showrunners need to incorporate the other facets of Dany's role in future episodes as she transitions from conqueror to ruler.
2015	Amris1	2014-05-13	I always thought she is doing great in GoT. And still do. She is pretty much perfect in the role in my opinion.
Â 
The complaints one reads 'wooden' etc pp to me seem to confuse the character she is playing and her herself as an actress.
Â 
To me her performance pretty much nails what Dany is supposed to be like at this stage. Dany is intelligent and talented but very young and a work in progress - and hiding it all behind a facade.
Â 
Some people seem to demand that EC somehow shows what behind the facade without removing the facade, if you know what I mean.
And to me she does just that. I get what's behind the facade (or think I do at least). I don't know why some people don't. If she made it any clearer it would become overacting for me. Less is more on my page.
Â 
Yes, her heroic one-liners are like 'omg - seriously?'. A little like Bush on that aircraft carrier claiming the war is won when the REAL trouble had hardly even started. But that's exactly how things are SUPPOSED to feel at this point. Dany has a lot of things to learn yet. And hides it and denies it. I really love these 'foolish' sides of her and the long way she has to go still.
Â 
Â 
Â
2016	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-13	She was great this episode!! Her delivery was exactly what it should be for those scenes, by the end she looked like a little girl and that was fantastic and deftly done.
2017	Batman	2014-05-13	No one ever confronted her on it in the books, or claimed someone "innocent" was killed (that's on this forum, not in the books), so how is it in line with the books?
ETA: She also questioned her decision in the books, the show is actually making her look worse.


Â 
They have less time. I didnt mean someone actually confronted her, just that a lot of time and nuance was put into making Dany's idea of ruling and justice very questionable. The show is very blunt so it makes sense that they would come right out and question her sense of justice. Like a couple of episodes ago when they came right out and questioned Brienne about her loving Jaime. Not subtle, but it got the job done.Â
2018	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-13	It was the same when people were having a go at Sophie for making Sansa so wooden and reserved. That was the point and now it's generally accepted that she is very good. Some people seem to struggle to differentiate between seeing a character from a POV and a non-POV direction
2019	Belisarius09	2014-05-13	I think she had fine delivery this episode.
Â 
She exhibited the Joy Dany gets from her altruistic mentality thinking she's doing some actual good in the world, and then quickly shifts and displays the response most teenagers would exhibit when they are told they are wrong, frustration.Â  The frustration they undergo when their petulant emotionally driven sense of right and wrong and entitlement are challenged by logic, reason, truth, and facts.

2021	adiman83	2014-05-13	Emilia Clarke was great this episode but am I the only one thinking she showed weakness by giving in to Hizhdar's demands?
2022	Rooseman	2014-05-13	Glad to see I'm not the only one.
Â 
I was really surprised, when Elio and Linda started complaining about her acting in this episode of all.
Â 
It was a great moment to see her facial expression drop when Hizdhar told her, that she crucified his father. This, and the way she spoke after that, really made it look as if the "regal" and wooden tone she keeps is really something that her character in-universe is trying to keep up (and fails at, if taken by surprise), not just a limitation of the actress.Â 
Â 
Â

2026	Jairion Lannister	2014-05-13	She was a bit better since the writing and dialogue was a little bit better and at least sort of realistic and well done because Hizdahr was written well from the point of view of the show.
2027	Gneisenau	2014-05-13	I still feel like she gets some badly conceived dialog.

2029	Panther2000	2014-05-13	What I picked up in was that during conversation with Hiz( can't spell his name)Â , but the look on BS face when the guy stated that his father was against slavery/killing the girls etc..... BS had the look of TOLD YOU SO, & even danny did a side eye toward BS.Â Â Â  She knew that she Messed up big time.
Â 
I just wonder if they changed the story from the little girl to the goat, or will that still happen.Â 
Â 
It is sad, but dani's lack of storyline & such really has little to do with the writing.Â  It is what is going on in the book.Â Â Â  Going from town to town freeing slaves, moving on to the next town doing the same, BOARING.Â  I found my self skipping her chapters when I read the books.Â Â Â  This is just where they are in the book.Â Â Â  I found the same thing with Brans chapters until he meets cold hand, then things picked up.
2030	Stormland's Fury	2014-05-13	I never had that any problems with her performance in general, just never thought she was stellar.

2036	The Strangler's Widow	2014-05-13	Does anyone else feel as if Emilia Clarke has started to "overact"? I find her scenes exhausting because it just seems like she's trying too hard to portray Dany as a ruthless queen. While it is true that Danaerys has gone through some major character development; from meek and unsure of herself to a cunning commander -- yet I think that she is more uncertain of herself in the books than she is coming across in the show. Perhaps this is a result of the writing of the episodes, but Dany was my favourite character in the beginning, and now I feel indifferent towards her involvement in the story's progression, and unfortunately I feel as if Emilia's performance is partly to blame. She is too intense, and far too dramatic IMO. If she would tone it down a bit, I think Dany would be a little more relatable/likeable. Just a thought, I'm curious to see if anyone agrees.

Is book Dany relatable/likeable at this point?
2039	Panther2000	2014-05-13	I really liked her during season 1 & 1/2 way through 2.Â Â  She got on my last nerves even in the book, but that is just because her story pretty much has been a Same old Same old.Â Â  I think once we get into a bit more action with her she may come off better.Â  This is where her story is right now.
2040	Stormland's Fury	2014-05-13	Does anyone else feel as if Emilia Clarke has started to "overact"? .


Â 
At times yes, but I think her supporting cast and adversaries do the same thing (except Jorah and Selmy). I found her better in the books because of that or at least more relatable since in my mind I just imagine her differently. Losing both Vyserys and Drogo (who were great) in the first season also took away from it since she doesn't really have anyone to counter-act to. Right now most of her entourage only speaks when spoken to or in short sentences and it seems like she's chewing the scenery in comparison.

	Spoiler In the books the surviving hoi polloi Meereen don't seem to give a damn about a bunch of other slavers being crucified. But they did seem upset over having their slave trade stopped, as well as do the , what?, middle classes in Meereen (GRRM never elaborates them) and Pit Fighters (how many of them could their be?)... and the Meereenize (Meereeni?) seem more upset about losing the gladiatorial circuses that anything else!

2043	Gus Petch	2014-05-13	She does always step up in the clutch. Â Emilia plays the big moments very well, such as her rousing speech prior to unleashing the collar-filled barrels over the walls of Meeren. Â She tends to underplay the normal, every day bits. Â But there's no complaints from me. Â She does a pretty good job.

Â 
It seemed to me that Slaver's bay was not really that lax about the whole thing as Rome, or at least a big chunk of the working class seems to be slaves or non-citizens (e.g. the sellsword companies) while the nobility basically are the merchants, artisans and so on.
2051	Hangover of the Morning	2014-05-13	Must say that I was quite positively surprised by her too.Â

She was awful last episode. I can understand the "icy-queen" persona in public but why she kept it during her private talk with Jorah was baffling.Â

2052	PatrickStormborn	2014-05-13	She was alright, yeah. Her wooden delivery to Hizdahr was cool cuz it showed she was feeling some self-doubt about the situation. That, and showing how Dany cant just proclaim things with this lot. Her petulance was nice when speaking to Hizdahr and it shows how arrogant Dany had been and how Hizdahr's words sorta brought her back to reality. Her "How many more??" at Missandei and Missandei responds with a huge number and her face is like: "seriously?..." Missandei's annoyed tone of "Yes, Your Grace." was really awesome too. Seems like the M-gal is like "ok, you bought this pig, you arent gonna bother feeding it?"


Â 
Lol such a bad interpretation of the scene. Missandei was not annoyed, just formal.
Â 
But, really, this has just reminded me what an awful idea it was to make Missandei older. There's nothing left to the character now apart from being a translator, which is unnecessary when Dany speaks Valyrian.
Â

Considering that she's still one of the most popular characters in the series (and one of the author's favourite characters), I'll guess "yes".Â

2056	ladystardust17	2014-05-13	Is book Dany relatable/likeable at this point?


Â 
IMO, she's becoming less and less likeable in the books.Â  I just started rereading ADOD and she does sound like a whiny teenager.Â  But that is exactly what GRRM does, he takes characters and makes you love them in the beginning only to show you they have a dark side, or makes you hate them (ie Jamie Lannister) only to show you their good side later. The point is that people are never black and white, but some shade of grey in the middle.
2057	bobbybuilderton	2014-05-13	She did do better than she usually does, but I still think she's a pretty crap actress. Doing well in a couple of scenes is not enough to change my mind on her overall. A broken clock is right twice a day...

2058	boojam	2014-05-13	Is book Dany relatable/likeable at this point?I liked her character in the first novel, most of the 2nd novel, almost all of the 3rd novel...Then in Dance, where she appears a lot, George seems to just carry along a 'template' Dany...Still I like the story in Essos a lot, mainly because it's so different the Westeros story, which I get tired of.One reason I like Arya's story so much in Braavos, it is a fine break from what started out as interesting court intrigue and then became kind of Blah soap opera at KL.The north is still weird enough for me, so I like that.One thing that bothers me is lack of passage of time, and I know it bothered George too, things need to have slowed down , people matured more in the books , stories and characters aged by about 5 years.Things have moved so damn fast that a degree of verisimilitude has been lost.I think GRRM could write a more mature Dany better.

Â 
It has a HUGE effect on Dany's narrative. Missandei could be any of the other handmaidens - and that's a complete dis-service to both Missandei and Daenerys, which makes it a bad decision.
Â 
With an adult Missandei, Dany loses the only character to whom she can truly present her inner conflicts and vulnerability, so that element of her characterisation is lost.Â 
Â 
There's pretty much no dynamic between the characters on the show, whereas in the books it's easily one of the most interesting relationships and tells us so much about Dany.Â
2060	jentario	2014-05-13	I love her, I do. I couldn't fathom another playing the part, but, at times this season she has come off as a little smug to me.


Dany is a little smug to (or at least was in ASOS). I am also happy we're headed into ADWD now and some less flashy material for Dany.
2061	Petyr Patter	2014-05-13	I actually didn't mind Clarke in this episode, which is a total 180 from my opinion of last episode: http://asoiaf.wester...e/#entry5741751
Â 
She was acting the regal stoic queen, but while sitting on that giant throne and hearing "supplicants" such an act is appropriate.Â  Plus, the script finally had her do something other than angry or annoyed.Â  We get to see her happy at the simple joy of paying a farmer for his goats.Â  Then we see her lose an argument and then realize she has a very hard long day ahead of her.
Â 
I still think she is a weak link for the show.Â  She turns conversations into proclamations.Â  And conversations are sort of important in Game of Thrones.
Â 


Daenerys speaks Valyrian and Ghiscari. Â Why does she need to have Missandei hanging around at all times? Â 


Â 
She knows Valyrian in show universe, but almost certainly not Ghiscari.Â  Remember, Missandei had to tell her Mhysa meant "mother" in Ghis.
2062	Stormland's Fury	2014-05-13	We never really find out. There do seem to be artisans , merchant mariners , farmers and herders, ..., but George is not interested in details like that, I guess.

Â 
Yeah I agree on that, that's why it really bothers me that he doesn't flesh it out more especially since it's such an important part of Dany's arc. I mean it seems she crushes their economy and those details would really help since she learns how to rule but we don't even know if it's comparable to ruling a society like Westeros.
Â 
The farmers and herders seem to be free, but I wouldn't really consider them middle class but more part of the worker class. Also they seem to only make money by selling slaves to outsiders otherwise their economy would make no sense at all.

Â 
Yeah, all this gets really lost on the show. It's like I mentioned before, her supporting cast basically just stands around a lot and talks very little in general.
I thought at first they would go at first somewhere with Dany telling Missandei with her "all men must die" remark, but nothing has really transpired yet.

2065	Onion Smuggler	2014-05-13	Was it just me who thought she wasn't great in this episode. I appreciate some of her dialogue isn't fantastic, but her delivery seems very over pronounced, I know she is a Queen but that is about all she can do. She has that one tone and apart from that very little?
2066	Pod The Impaler	2014-05-13	Does anyone else think she was very good this episode? I thought did a great job when talking to the goat herder and, the more sympathetic tone she gradually took on when talking to Hizdahr after being loathsome initially was great.


Â 
Â 
It was a good scene. You can see her visibly softening from dragon rage to more sympathetic. She does not consider herself a murder, and the point that children were also crucified by the slavers was never forgotten. However, Dany never got to mourn for her own murdered father (nor dead mother), and it likely weighs on her mind just thinking of what Robert the Usurper probably with the remains of her father and eldest brother. Perhaps this is something Hizdahr knew and was counting on.
2067	PatrickStormborn	2014-05-13	I totally disagree.
I like the aging up.
NO! I disagree that is does no disservice or characterization , this is not the book, the re-interpretations work just fine.


Â 
I know it's not the book because, you know, I am capable of recognising that television is a different medium to a book. But aging Missandei up offers no benefit in the conversion of the book to the screen. With an adult Missandei, the viewer has no window into Dany's mind; that is obviously a problem and results in a more shallow Daenerys.
Â 
Considering that D&D are clearly trying to present Dany as complex, if their behind-the-scenes videos are anything to go by, their failure to do so is a PROBLEM with the show. This would not even be a problem if they had not made Missandei older.
Â 
Feel free to keep defending the show. You like older Missandei? Great! I'm not trying to dictate what you should or shouldn't like. But at least acknowledge that it doesn't facilitate the characterisation of Dany; Irri could be taking the role of Missandei and the show would barely be different. If you're not willing to acknowledge that, let's just stop this discussion altogether.
2068	cade	2014-05-13	I thought she was very good but I rarely think she's anything less. Any problems I have with her scenes is almost invariably due to writing or directing. Qarth was a major disappointment, and increasingly over the last two seasons I think Dany's arc has been written in a very rushed, plot-driven manner. There's only so much any actor can do with that. She can only express vulnerability when the writing calls for it. I think she very clearly showed doubt and fear of inadequacy in the previous episode, but the writing only allowed for about 20 seconds of it, so many people didn't notice.
Â 


She was alright, yeah. Her wooden delivery to Hizdahr was cool cuz it showed she was feeling some self-doubt about the situation. That, and showing how Dany cant just proclaim things with this lot. Her petulance was nice when speaking to Hizdahr and it shows how arrogant Dany had been and how Hizdahr's words sorta brought her back to reality.

Seems like the M-gal is like "ok, you bought this pig, you arent gonna bother feeding it?"


Â 
This severely distorts Missandei's reaction. She displayed no annoyance whatsoever, nor did she even say "Yes, Your Grace."

2069	Night'sQueen	2014-05-13	Same. I was thinking ffs are we going to have an Emilia can't act thread every episode? Glad it wasn't that. I can't say I was impressed or disappointed with her this episode, she was just ok. The end of Breaker of Chains has still been her best scene since "Dracarys" imo.
I thought she was great during the scene with Harzoo. She had to convey a lot with her facial expressions and her eyes. She managed to show glimmers of doubt behind the queenly facade. Not a big dracarys type moment, but subtle and I would imagine rather difficult to do as an actor.

Â 
And probably more fun.Â  She always sounds like she has a real good handle on the character in interview snippets I've read/heard.Â  I would suspect she's been looking forward to sinking her actor teeth into Dany's struggles.Â  Man cannot live on ham alone (even if it's very good ham, like her shouting in fake languages is).
Â 
Doing the same thing over and over again gets kinda dull.Â  I imagine this is part of why actors tend to dread getting typecast.

No lie. Ham is all well and good but if its the only thing in the diet, issues arise. Even the spiral roasted ham with cloves and pineapple with the honey glaze. Time to eat yer veggies, Miss Clarke! Broccoli aint bad! Here, have some ranch to dip it in.Â Now to get her to eat the acting beets. I hope she isnt Tommen for those. 
Serious actors dread typecasting. Even classically trained guys can fall into that trap and its kinda gnarly. (probably why a lot of them stay in the UK or on the stage.)
2072	Cyvasse Khal	2014-05-13	She was better this episode, mostly because she was forced to be. If we weren't going to see the self doubt from Emilia's portrayal in this scene, then I don't think we were ever going to see it. I kind of think Emilia being a big fan and reading all of the books has worked against her, because she already knew well in advance that Dany gets to that sort of arrogant, reckless, over zealous, almost emotionless Queen. So she took to that mindset far too early in my opinion. There wasn't great transition between vulnerable season 1 Dany and season 2 onwards Khaleesi/Queen Dany.
Â 
Also, still think she is more comfortable speaking made up languages than English. It's so weird how effortlessly Dothraki and Valyrian come out of her mouth, yet every English word is spoken like she's trying to ace a school oral exam.
2073	Lord Thornhart	2014-05-13	She still has those dead eyes. I swear she blanked out at least twice during Loraq's speech. Felt just like the time she fell asleep with her eyes open while her brother was being murdered. Emilia should stick with voice acting.
2074	Hodor's Dragon	2014-05-13	She still has those dead eyes. I swear she blanked out at least twice during Loraq's speech. Felt just like the time she fell asleep with her eyes open while her brother was being murdered. Emilia should stick with voice acting.


Â 
Right, her career is obviously going so poorly. Â She definitely has the looks for radio.
Â
2075	Mad Monkey	2014-05-13	I'm not sure why you guys are going after Emilia Clarke so hard. You don't think she can get to you? You think she can't find out where you live? There are many film critics and acting coaches who thought so. They all died, the last thing they saw in this life being those beautiful eyes, devoid of any molecule of pity, any atom of mercy.In all seriousness though, I think she will improve as her scripts improve. Right now, this is the only episode when she had been given dialogue that isn't just a dramatic speech or monologue and I think she's done well playing off of Hizdahr and the guy playing the goatherd. As the Meereen storyline becomes more complex and she gets more stuff to do, I fully expect her to rise to the challenge.It's kind of like Dillane's Stannis. His character hasn't been given much to do this season at all except stand/sit and brood, but he is still a great actor and once Stannis's storyline gets a jumpstart things will be different. Maybe Clarke isn't in Dillane's league but she's still pretty good when she's given something.

Ive seen Dillane in like a whole bunch of stuff and i know hes particularly awesome. GoT is really Clarke's first real gig but its been a while now, so i guess people expected more from her? Its not that much to ask really. I actually think she was ok in this episode. Not 100% crescent fresh, but certainly a lot better than i expected. This is a good sign that she likes her acting broccoli and doesnt just want to eat the ham.Â

Â 
Personally, I feel she is destined for better things that an HBO series.
Â 
Hey, c'mon, 10 episodes a year, she could do a major movie in the off-season and still have lots of time left over.
2080	The Strangler's Widow	2014-05-13	I think "her adversaries speak only when spoken to" is a very good point. She seems to be responsible for delivering demands and listening to only what she asked been asked to hear. It would be refreshing for D&D to write her some lines that are less focused on authority and moreso on humanism, as the books do embellish.
2081	The Strangler's Widow	2014-05-13	Well I do feel as if Dany is far more uncertain of her decisions in the books. Of course, it is hard to convey one's thoughts in a TV show, however - the fact that she questions herself multiple times in the books -- both regarding her role as a ruler and a lover -- is far more relatable than a teen who is unquestionably controlling a city. I do understand what you're saying; certainly in the earlier books she is much more of a follower than a leader, which is more relatable for most people. I feel as if the shift that was made from follower to leader was too abrupt in the show, and it has come at a cost, which I largely feel the writers are responsible for.
2082	Nictarion	2014-05-14	Â 
I dunno, they gotta find something, right?
Â 
Personally, I feel she is destined for better things that an HBO series.
Â 
Hey, c'mon, 10 episodes a year, she could do a major movie in the off-season and still have lots of time left over.She has been casted in the new Terminator movie.
2083	Bear Island	2014-05-14	My problem with Emilia is that I feel like she's out of her depth.
I think that she tries to portray Dany as strong and relatively fearless. It comes across (to me) as Dany being smug, patronising and basically quite unlikeable.
In the books we have the benefit of her inner monologue. We know she sometimes longs for a simple life in the house with the red door. We know that she cares very deeply for Jorah, Ser Barristan, Grey Worm, Missandei and Khal Drogo. We see her struggle with her decisions, we see her having to remind herself to be strong and brave. We know she cares about the people who support her and wants to be just (even if her idea of justice is often fucked up).
We don't get the benefit of that in the show, which means the actor needs to rely on dialogue, expression, tone and body language to express those deeper feelings. I don't think Emilia manages it. She uses the same expression and tone constantly (haughty/bored/smug) and that's a shame.
The scene with the shepherd was nice, but she doesn't emote often enough.
I think she's not really a camera actor. She would be fine onstage where you have to basically exaggerate everything to allow everyone in the audience to see, but camerawork is all about subtlety, tiny changes in expression or posture or inflection that speak volumes without a word being spoken. To me she doesn't do it well enough.
2084	Night's_King	2014-05-14	She shows some emotion and all you people think she is a great actress again?
Â 
I still think that her acting was stiff and seemed unnatural.
2085	Bear Island	2014-05-14	I agree that she seems stilted and unnatural. I actually liked her scenes in this episode far more than I usually do but a decent performance isn't really acceptable in a show with such a high caliber of actor. This is why I feel she's out of her depth. She is simply not as good as the others generally are.
2086	Stormland's Fury	2014-05-14	Some of the child actors are better then she is at times. Notably Arya, Shireen and the kid who plays Rickon.
2087	Red Raven	2014-05-14	She gets the Emmy noms and it baffles me why.Â 
Â 


Some of the child actors are better then she is at times. Notably Arya, Shireen and the kid who plays Rickon.


Â 
Agreed. Â Even compared to the kids Emilia is the weak link. Â She's a nice person and all but not a great actress and I'm starting to dread whenever the wooden post that is supposed to be Dany appears onscreen.
2088	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-14	I don't know why some people are saying the acting was really subtle this episode, it wasn't, she was visibly shaken when confronted with her act against the masters and by the end of the episode looked and sounded like a little girl.
2089	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-14	I actually don't know how different Show Dany can be right now with a different actress, they'd still have written her in this way, and that episode was a really good example of some good acting from Clarke, and shows Dany as vulnerable, doubting herself.
''Bury your father'' was delivered excellently when compared to her Badass Queen facade.
2090	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-14	I also thought she was adorable when she was telling the goat herd she'd pay him back, as she was really annunciating every word like she was going through the motions of actually being a queen and listening to the small folk's problems, and she was really trying hard as a young girl to be a good queen and I could tell that just because of her performance. I was NOT impressed with her scene last week, but this episode? Really? watch it again, the acting nuance is all there.
2091	Stormland's Fury	2014-05-14	I actually don't know how different Show Dany can be right now with a different actress, they'd still have written her in this way, and that episode was a really good example of some good acting from Clarke, and shows Dany as vulnerable, doubting herself.

Â 
The problem is she's hamming it up a lot (that's the writer's fault as well). Book!Dany seemed more fit to be played by someone like Mia Wasikowska or someone along those lines.
2092	Frey Pies	2014-05-14	I liked her character in the first novel, most of the 2nd novel, almost all of the 3rd novel...
Then in Dance, where she appears a lot, George seems to just carry along a 'template' Dany...
Still I like the story in Essos a lot, mainly because it's so different the Westeros story, which I get tired of.
One reason I like Arya's story so much in Braavos, it is a fine break from what started out as interesting court intrigue and then became kind of Blah soap opera at KL.
The north is still weird enough for me, so I like that.
One thing that bothers me is lack of passage of time, and I know it bothered George too, things need to have slowed down , people matured more in the books , stories and characters aged by about 5 years.
Things have moved so damn fast that a degree of verisimilitude has been lost.
I think GRRM could write a more mature Dany better.


Â 
I think so. It's amazing how much GRRM messed up the big characters in ADWD, and one can see that the lack of the 5 year gap really affected the story. He took characters which used to have solid arcs through the season (Dany) and excellent ones (Tyrion), and made their chapters really boring.
Â 
I'm sure things will pick up in TWoW though Â

She's only ''hamming it up'' when she's addressing her soldiers and potential enemies in a battle cry. Hammy is the only way to deliver those sort of lines.
Â 
You simply can't just pick lines where the acting is appropriate as examples of her being hammy. This episode she WASN'T.Â 
Â 
She was childish and irritable when initially addressing hizdahr, she was visibly shaken when confronted with the defense that she was wrong, she was small and wary by the end of the episode when she realised there was 200 odd people still left to see.Â 
Â 
Simply, her scene this last episode was good. It wasn't hammy, it wasn't wooden and I think I might have watched something completely different to the people who said it was.
Â 
And I was one of the MAIN people criticising her scene last episode. I am picky AS HELL with acting.
2094	Clariana	2014-05-14	Â 
Here are some pictures of her from last year. Â Look how red her hands are. Â I'm no doctor, and maybe a real doctor could give you some better explanation, but I've known a few drunks and I associate hands like that with alcoholism.

I wasn't only talking about that one scene but her in general,
2096	Lord Thornhart	2014-05-14	Some of the child actors are better then she is at times. Notably Arya, Shireen and the kid who plays Rickon.


Â 
Don't forget Sweetrobin, he's probably the best child actor on the whole show. It's pretty sad.
2097	LordStoneheart	2014-05-14	The girl who played Alice? Really? Does she seem like a Dany to anyone else? I don't see it.
2098	Stormland's Fury	2014-05-14	Â 
Don't forget Sweetrobin, he's probably the best child actor on the whole show. It's pretty sad.


Â 
He's pretty good too, but I'm really impressed with Shireen.
As a whole I think they really got lucky to get so many great child actors, especially considering it's the first gig for most of them.
Â 
Sophie Turner sadly is a bit unnatural at times. Actors like for Jojen and Joffrey are great too but they are adults.
2099	Stormland's Fury	2014-05-14	The girl who played Alice? Really? Does she seem like a Dany to anyone else? I don't see it.


Â 
I saw her in other stuff and she could pull off the aura. She can be both serious and humble, but also get angry and play the vulnerable child when the "adult" facade breaks. Wasikowska in the TV-show "In Treatment" was everything Dany should be.
Â 
Only because she was Alice (and not stellar in that either) doesn't mean she could work in other projects. People couldn't see Heath Ledger as the Joker either and look how that turned out.

Â 
Yes, the swollen knuckles are not what I think about with alcoholism, it was the reddened fingers that I had noticed. Â And those knuckles look pretty bad in that top shot, don't they? Â Either she had shut her hand in a car door recently, or there's something the matter there.
Â 
But on the other, um, hand, her handsÂ do look better this year. Â It's not just those few photos I linked to that I'm basing this on, I've been watching her hands for a while because I thought I had noticed something was wrong.
2101	Florina Laufeyson	2014-05-14	Â

Me too. And how.
She was alright this time. The flickering mask, the uncertain vocalization, the crack in her tone when Hizdahr presses. I want more of that kind of thing. The reason im hard on Clarke is cuz i feel like she can be better than she is.Â 
Â 
Â 


She has been casted in the new Terminator movie.


I think she'll do well in that role. Sarah Conner isnt what i would call super complex. That character has a measure of nuance but shes cake compared to Dany. Plus its a lot of fun to be around Terminators and big guns.Â

Yeah and a lot of fun. Being in an action movie has got to be the acting equivalent of eating ice cream while being on the Matterhorn in Disneyland.Â Look at the fun that guys like Tom Hiddleston were having in those Marvel movies! So Clarke being Conner will be fun and she can roll around in it like a kid in a candy store. If the rest of the season has her being like she was this episode, ill concede that she earned it.Â 
Headey has been in some pretty fun roles. Like that chick in the last Dredd movie. She knows how to have a good time too.

Â 
I think Heady fits in those "though tomboyish" roles like in Dredd or in Sarah Connor Chronicles. She's a good Cersei but I think she doesn't have that Book!Cersei elegance and looks to her. She is good looking in a different way.
2106	Carey Snow	2014-05-14	Â 
I think so. It's amazing how much GRRM messed up the big characters in ADWD, and one can see that the lack of the 5 year gap really affected the story. He took characters which used to have solid arcs through the season (Dany) and excellent ones (Tyrion), and made their chapters really boring.

Â 
George RR Martin readers learn to have patience for the payoffs. We just read the middle book, it was a bridge. The climax starts prob 1/2 through the next book (aWoW) and builds through out aDoS. I expect another aCoC and aSoS to come our way,Â  maybe even better.
2107	Carey Snow	2014-05-14	Oh, and Clark is a fine actress who does a fine Dany.

2109	Bear Island	2014-05-14	I don't know why people think shooting is fun. Sometimes it can be, but it's also full of getting up at the crack of dawn and leaving at midnight, freezing your ass off or suffocating in the heat because winter shoots for summer and summer for winter, getting injured, having to do the same thing over and over and over and over and over, dealing with actors/directors/production and their egos, all the tedious wardrobe fittings, having to continually push yourself past breaking point, memorising massive tomes of text.... and so on and so forth.
Acting itself can be fun, but I don't feel like the shooting itself is as easy and fun as a lot of people seem to believe it to be. Some jobs are better than others, of course. I'll never understand people who leave voice acting for TV. Voice acting is a cushy as hell gig and once you're in, you're in for life basically.

					
					
							Edited by Bear Island, 14 May 2014 - 10:57 PM.
2110	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-15	Yeah, I can imagine tv shoots being a bit more 'fun' because youre friends with people but shooting itself with cameras all around you isnt necessarily super fun.
2111	LordStoneheart	2014-05-15	Florina has the right of it. she's a good actress but her performance has been lacking and all around inconsistent since S2 with good shades in between then. I think some of it definitely stems from the writing though. This last episode was the first "emotional" thing we've gotten from her in a while. And I think that's where she can truly excel.
Â 
As to the poster who mentioned Mia W, I have not seen In Treatment but I shall check it out. I've seen her performance in Jane Eyre, not just Alice, and I still can't quite see her as Daenerys.

Â 
I have to add she's a bit too whiny there to be Dany, but still you can the just of the whole she has to be strong even though she had a shitty childhood and so on and needs to act more like an adult even though she's still basically child. It doesn't have necessarily to be her but someone more versed in dramatic roles than Emilia.
2113	Bear Island	2014-05-15	I'd imagine that GOT would be very tedious to film, but would be a fun place during down-time.Â 
I might be wrong, but I think on average Emilia has to film with green screens more frequently than a lot of the other main cast do. Maybe her performance is affected by that. Then again, if she was a voice actor she should be used to having to act without the benefit of sets, other actors, costumes and so forth.
I really do feel like she's better suited to theatre. Not every actor is a camera actor, and it doesn't mean you're not talented. It just means your particular skillset isn't best suited for camera work. In theatre it's far more acceptable to ham it up and subtlety can actually work against you. Were she playing Dany in a play I think she'd be great. She just hasn't shown herself to have the chops for TV Dany imo.
2114	Gogossos	2014-05-15	She's doing just fine, even for tv. Some of her critics here don't seem to understand bookDany very well and seem totally baffled when they watch a different tvDany. It's like a teacher telling you that the essay you spent ages on was totally wrong and off topic, you need to write another one!Â

Â 
She's doing fine for TV but like I said she has a huge load on her carrying her own story. Especially since Drogo and Vyserys died and the remaining cast's lines became less and less.
2116	MoIaF	2014-05-15	Emilia has had some inconsistent performances but a good part of that has to do with the writing / directing and some with her own inexperience / talent. However, when it comes to the big moments she had always been able to deliver, it's the more subtle moments that she has had more issues with. As for the TV comment, you obviously didn't want Dracarys one of the best scenes in the whole series.

Â 
Oh, I know that. I always used to feel defensive, when I used to browse through this site before ADWD's release and hear all the complaints about AFFC. Sure, GRRM had made quite a boring book, but I believed that he was just setting up for the inevitably awesome ADWD. However, when you take two books to set things up without providing any sort of resolutions at all, then that is not impressive. Also, if only he'd included one of the two battles in ADWD, it would have gone down as being pretty great. However, he wasted time instead on pointless chapters and exposition that he hadn't done in books 1-3 (all the food, etc). His pacing was off by a lot in comparison to his first three. I still love the series, I just don't consider GRRM as highly as I used to. ADWD and AFFC were incredibly disappointing for me :'( .
2118	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-15	I still don't get how AFFC is boring...

Â 
It's not as engaging because almost half of it deals with merely moving people from one place to another, and spends a lot of time on lesser POVs that were just added during the book and are not that engaging. World building is great, but not for 700+ pages. Â

It also succeeds the whammy festival that was Storm of Swords, so it pales in comparison by default.
2121	Bear Island	2014-05-15	I've always enjoyed AFFC too, even though it had no chance of holding up against ASoS. Dance was disappointing, but on my 3rd or so re-read I'm for some reason getting more value from it.

Normally I don't have much of an opinion on her one way or another. I just re-watched the episode in the background while taking care of some things in the house and when that Hizadr scene came up it was pretty bad how wooden she sounded just listening to the audio.
Â 
It really sounded like some middle school theater class and the way the conversation flowed was just off, like as soon as she heard him stop talking she started reading off a cue card or something and rushed it just to get her line off. I'm not really an acting expert or anything and don't really notice huge differences between slightly bad to slightly good acting, but that scene was really jarring for some reason.
2123	Bear Island	2014-05-15	You don't need to be an actor to recognise when something isn't right, just like you don't have to be a chef to know when food tastes bad.
I think she'd benefit from some masterclasses with a really good acting coach. She needs to learn how to deliver a subtle performance. If she doesn't, she'll never progress beyond hammy. A truly good actor can take bad dialogue and completely overcome it with their talent. Hammy lines don't necessitate a hammy performance.

Â 
I so agree. Â It's not a matter of not understanding the book (I understand it just fine) or not realizing that the book and the show are different (duh!) or it just being bad writing. Â An actor that is genuinely good can rise above bad material. Â 
Others on the show have been saddled with clunky lines and weird dialogue and yet their performances were just fine and even excellent because the actor had the skill to do something with the crap they were handed. Â Emilia just isn't that good.

Â 
Agreed. Charles Dance, Diana Rigg and Kerry Ingram never read the books and a lot of it is even show exclusive stuff (which in general is not on par with the books), yet they elevate the material. Stephen Dillane has to work with some very mediocre writing at best, yet still manages to give a good performance,

Tho, I think in general they have been given good dialog.Maisie is amazing and seems born to acting ...
	Spoiler  she has a real test coming up in Braavos 
 but I think she will be able to do it.Broken Record:Clarke was fine in season 1.Season 2, E1,E2 and mostly E10... she was fine... I think D and D wrecked her with their awful dialog and the directors minds seemed elsewhere in the other episodes.Season 3 I thought she was spot on, as I have said about 50 times now, Clarke hit it out of the park with DRACARYS, S3E4....The Essos story this season has been on such a short leash it's hard to say much about it... except that Clarke's address to Meereen in Valyrian was spot on! That must have been hard to do.I see a young actress , who, given good dialog and stage direction can be very good ... she seems lost when she does not get those things.

2127	Gogossos	2014-05-16	Well, it's no use all of us reiterating the same arguments over and over again. I've seen subtlety when required, I've seen fiery confidence when the scene (or books) called for it, I've seen fear way back in S1; I've seen a lot of variety in her performance, what more do you guys want? Maybe what sounds "off", "wooden" or "weird" just boils down to accent and it might not be agreeable to your ears for that reason. Otherwise, saying Emilia can't act, well I don't accept that, based on what I've seen. Of course I'm not trying to impose my opinion on everyone here but at the same time I'm not going to agree to opinions that I find incorrect.Â

I think this should be a good demonstration of her skill, her co-star is great, the writer and director are great. It'll be a good test.

2129	Hodor's Dragon	2014-05-16	Have you people never seen good actors struggle with crappy material before?
Â 
I've seen a lot of good acting from Emilia Clarke in this series. Â She got stuck with frickin' dreck in episodes 4 and 5 this season. Â You know, those melodramatic turns were in the script or mandated by the directorÂ for sureÂ before she delivered the unsupported melodramatic line "I will do what queens do. Â I will rule." Â There's just no way to save that material, I don't care who's acting.
Â 
The problem is not Emilia Clarke, the problem is that they dumped all the moodiness and self-questioning from the book character and left Danaerys one-dimensional. Â Hopefully they only dumped it temporarily because (1) they didn't have much time this year for that plot strand, because it generally ain't that fascinating, and (2) they judged it more important to paint Dany as a Great Conquering Queen to (and again I sayÂ hopefully) set up the contrast when they bring in the uncertainty and emotional flightiness of the book character later on.
Â 
I'm optimistic because episode 6 Dany was a lot more like book Dany. Â And IMO Clarke nailed it.
2130	marsyao	2014-05-16	OMG, she looks nothing like Bonnie, this is ridiculous. But by the way, the tile of this future film is from Bonnie Parker's poen "The story of Bonnie and Clyde"
Â 
"Some day they'll go down together;
And they'll bury them side by side;
Â Â Â Â Â  To few it'll be grief
Â Â Â Â Â  To the law a relief
But it's death for Bonnie and Clyde."
Â 
They actually were not burried side by side, Bonnie's mother made sure of that.
2131	Red Raven	2014-05-16	Maybe what sounds "off", "wooden" or "weird" just boils down to accent and it might not be agreeable to your ears for that reason.
Â 
No. Â It's wooden because it's wooden. Â The "accent not agreeable to your ears" argument is just bizarre.

2135	Bear Island	2014-05-18	I don't understand the assertion that it's the script making Dany seem corny/stiff/whatever rather than her acting.
A poor craftsman blames his tools.
The fact of the matter is that really skilled actors can successfully get across their character's thoughts and feelings without dialogue at all, and 'bad' dialogue can be overcome by flexing your acting muscles and compensating for it.
I'm sorry, but the line 'I will do what queens do. I shall rule' is not a hammy atrocity. It could be said in so many different ways. Her inflection made it hammy. The hardness, the aloofness, her expression (which many people see as haughty or smug) are what gave it that quality. Yes, actors are given direction. However, actors are also given agency to bring their own thoughts and interpretations to a scene. If Emilia had an issue with the turning around being melodramatic, or had her own ideas about how to deliver the line she could have simply discussed it with the director. Directors can and do listen to actor's suggestions, especially in TV shows that have been going for years where the actor has a very firm grasp of the character.
All she would have had to do is soften her expression, change the inflection slightly and that line could have come across in a completely different way. I promise you, Peter Dinklage and Nikolaj and Charles Dance all bring their own ideas to the table and talk to the director about making changes if they feel they need to be made, and they have ALL had some pretty hammy dialogue at times. It's unreasonable to claim that Dany and only Dany suffers from poor writing.
I understand that everyone has their own opinions of what constitutes a good performance, and that's fine. I'm not trying to convince anyone of anything, I'm just trying to give my perspective. I was an actor myself and my experiences inform my viewpoints.
Are the lines ridiculous sometimes? Yes, absolutely, but they can be delivered in such a way as to mitigate that. I am not saying Emilia is a bad actor, she's not. She has shown herself to be capable of nuance and subtlety but she needs to employ it more frequently. Nobody here has said she's a bad actor.
2136	LordStoneheart	2014-05-18	Â Nobody here has said she's a bad actor.


Â 
Actually it seems that what a lot of the comments are.
2137	Stormland's Fury	2014-05-18	Â Her inflection made it hammy.Â 


Â 
Maybe they wanted to go meta and say that her character is born amidst salt and smoke.
2138	LordStoneheart	2014-05-18	I've been watching the scene over and over and over and over... and I don't see what anyone means by hammy except for one part, which she thanks Hizdahr for his father's work on the pyramids which I took for sarcasm. I even listened to it without watching and it doesn't seem bad. Can a harsh critic of hers do a line by line breakdown of the supposed problem?Â 
Â 
In season two when she speaks to the Spice King, that seems more like what the problems here are describing. This last episode seems fine. Her facial expressions are great.Â

Â 
I'm not a harsh critic and I think she does a fine job most of the time (and like I mentioned before, what is she supposed to do if her supporting cast is written in the background, of course all the pressure is on her).Â 
Â 
But you described the problem yourself, the fact that we even have to discuss if it was sarcasm or not is a good indication. There is subtlety and there is not knowing what the actor was actually going for. An actor is supposed to make us feel a certain way through his whole presence, body language and not only the delivery of his lines.Â 
Â 
With Emilia (and she's not the only one or the worst in this show) I sometimes actually can see the script in my mind as she seem to convey emotions on cue e.g. "now comes the line where I have to be angry". And again if she has a supporting cast that doesn't say really that much it's difficult to get the emotions flowing in a natural way and it ends up with being obvious action and reaction.

When I heard her dialog , and she had just told Ser Jorah something like "I am staying in Meereen" and Ser Jorah says something like "and do what?" , I would have cut the "I will do what queens do"... I would have just had her say (after a few beats) "rule". I don't know why Michelle MacLaren didn't turn to Dave or Dan , one or the other is always on set, and say "Well that was awkward dialog". Even in run though of the script I don't know if Clarke would have picked up on it but MachLaren sure should have, well Dave or Dan had a tin ear when writing it!They must have shot that scene many times and I have to wonder if there was a better take?!
					
					
							Edited by boojam, 18 May 2014 - 08:37 AM.
2141	PatrickStormborn	2014-05-18	I just think some people expect too much from Emilia. Compare her story to the others in the show; hers is the only one where her supporting cast is limited to just being a supporting cast to her.
Â 
In King's Landing, Tywin, Jaime, Cersei, Tyrion and Margaery (and previously the Queen of Thorns) are all much more than supporting characters; at the Wall the primary focus has always been on Jon, but Sam isn't just his supporting character, and the threat of the wildlings and the Others means that the story at the Wall can never just be limited to Jon; whoever Arya is with on the show usually ends up getting a lot of focus (Jaqen, Tywin, the Brotherhood, Sandor); Littlefinger gets about the same amount of attention as Sansa does, and the same goes for Theon and Ramsay; Melisandre and Davos are a huge part of Stannis's story (which is exactly how it should be). Bran and Brienne's storylines are perhaps slightly different, but they get relatively little screentime and the interaction they have with other characters is always of significance.
Â 
With Dany, on the other hand, she's completely the focus of the entire eastern storyline. She has an interesting (and talented) supporting cast, but they're all devoted to her, and the scenes themselves are devoted to her (even when she isn't present - e.g. the scene between Grey Worm and Missandei sheds light on their characters, but ultimately it's about Dany's conquest of Meereen).
Â 
She obviously had a more positive reception in season one when her supporting cast included Illyrio, Drogo, Viserys, Mirri Maz Duur, Irri, Doreah, Rakharo, the Wineseller, etc, and when she shared some of the focus with Viserys.
Â 
Her Astapor scenes were generally positively received, as were her scenes against the Yunkish envoy and the leaders of the Second Sons - clearly antagonistic supporting characters are also important. Not including the Astapor and Qartheen envoys in episode 5 to deliver the news about Astapor and Yunkai was a HUGE mistake IMO.

Â 


Â 
Viserys, Drogo and more Jorah definitely took some load of her.
Â 
I think most people agree that Peter Dinklage is one of the top tier actors the show has, but there was one scene in Season 3 where he was alone with Shae and she's simply sub-par. Even he couldn't save that scene (and came across cheesy as well), which shows that the supporting cast does indeed matter.

Â 
The accent comment should have been directed at Gogossos, my mistake. Â 
Â 
However, I haven't stated my opinion with any more absoluteness than some others in this thread. Â That I didn't litter my post with enough IMHOs, IMOs and IMOBIHOsÂ and a bunch of other ridiculous acronyms to keep you happy is too damn bad; it's not my job to cater to you. Â The accent comment by that other person is still bizarre.

Â 
True. Â She has had some good and great moments and some of my favorites of the series are hers from season 1. Â Unfortunately this season in particular has exposed some weaknesses. Â She and Pedro had an identical line: Â "Take off your clothes." Â When he delivered it, it was smoking hot. Â Unfortunately from her it was a sexless clunker. Â (It doesn't help that she and the actor who plays Daario have zero chemistry while Pedro could generate chemistry with a brick.)

2153	GallowsKnight	2014-05-12	It's probably no one at the moment.
Â 
But if the writers needed it, he could become Garlen Tyrell (now a cousin of the Tyrells to side step the inheritance issue) or an aged up Dickon Tarly. Or a merged Redwyne tywins.
Â 
It's like showing the Manderly guy at the RW. It could just be background dressing or if they need to an early reference to an upcoming plot.
2154	~DarkHorse~	2014-05-12	Obviously, Olyvar is busy with Oberyn these days so Loras needs a new boy toy.

2156	zaphodbrx	2014-05-12	It's just an extra
2157	Lord Damian	2014-05-12	Tyrell cousin it would seem as Loras still needs to Join the Kings Guard and the marrage thing with Cersei will never happen.
2158	Yazzyaz	2014-05-12	I know he was not highlighted upon in the show and I understand your arguments regarding him being placed as an extra, but don't you guys think that D&D wouldn't place an extra standing next to the Tyrells and get a few second screen time unless it could be someone of (minor) importance later on in the series?Â 
Â 
Garlan in the books returned back to Highgarden with his Grandma, but perhaps this is Garlan. Wilas was mentioned in the series though, not Garlan, so I'm confused.
Â 
The reason I believe he is a Tyrell is because of his clothing and hair. Green shirt, I mean come on. D&D wouldn't place him next to the Tyrells unless he's going to appear later in the show. Why hire an extra when you can just focus on Margaery and Loras in this shot.
Â 
Just my thoughts. I know it holds no importance to the story, but this series is all about the theories and the characters, that's what makes it so appealing.
2159	Eddard the Builder	2014-05-12	He'd have to be a cousin, it's specifically stated in Season 3 that if Loras is named to the King's guard Highgarden would pass to Marg's children. Â
2160	Salad Days Saan	2014-05-12	They did cut to the Tyrell kids a lot, and he sure was there every time.
Â 
He's nobody for now but if they need him to be a cousin or maybe even a bastard brother in Season 5 and beyond, there he is.Â Â  His clothing was too similar in look to Loras so he's most likely not a page or a servant or anything.Â  He's on their level, and the costuming definitely makes it look like he's actually one of them [a Hightower or a Tarly would wear similar looking clothes but not the actual same color, they'd have their own family colors].
Â 
"demoting" Garlan to bastard brother and making him a Flowers instead of a Tyrell might be a way the show wants to go to illustrate the Tyrells are a close-knit family that actually likes each other to contrast them with the Lannisters going forward.Â  And it would not contradict what Tywin seemed to establish as show canon last season that Loras is the only male heir to Highgarden/potential propagator of the Tyrell name.

Â 
And Mace could always "adopt" him or name a nephew his heir anyway, especially if he needed to in a pinch because Loras was unavailable.
Â 
He could even adopt the Tyrell surname officially, would probably even want to for the sake of continuity and/or Mace could make it a condition of the inheritance.Â  Nobles change their names all the time when ascending to new titles (though admittedly that's more of a royal thing).Â  They've got 7 last names from all the other noble families they're married into and descended from, you can just rotate the order around depending which one is most convenient at the time.
Â 
He's still of Tyrell blood after all, even its the maternal line and he's officially a Hightower or whatever, so he'd be entitled to the name.
Â 
[It's also canon-consistent of Tywin to not recognize/forget about this option since it's an option he doesn't seem to have/want to consider, as suggested by Jaime's "whatcha gonna do, dad, go with Lancel?Â  LOL" line.]
Â 
Â 


Randall Tarly ?


Â 
Looks too close in age to Loras and Marge.Â  Randyl should be older, closer to Mace.Â  If it's a Tarly it'd have to be Sam's little brother Dickon who hasn't even put in a book appearance yet, let alone the show

Garlan was completely cut from the show I think.
Aurane's part in the story is coming up soon so it makes sense for the show to give us a peek of him now. They did the same thing for Tommen at the beginning of the season: show him standing around at Joff's wedding but not saying anything before his part begins.

2187	Hippocras	2014-05-13	I'm 185% sure it's Syrio.

That's a pretty precise number.
2188	Red Raven	2014-05-13	Some random Tyrell cousin who can be upgraded for plot reasons later if need be.
2189	Hippocras	2014-05-13	Why is no one in agreement it is Aurane? Who else would possibly have enough future importance to get cast at this particular point in time, exactly when Aurane first appears in the books?
2190	NOT A TARG I SWEAR	2014-05-13	That's a pretty precise number.


I rounded up from 177%

2192	Daktura Nurovaia	2014-05-13	C'mon guys, it's obviously Jaqen H'ghar...Â
2193	GallowsKnight	2014-05-13	Exactly. The GoT wiki says straight up that Garlan was cut from the show. So it's not him, nor is it Willas.
Aurane, however, arrived in KL with the Tyrells. He came for the wedding. He is the best bet.


What people have suggested here is not that Garlan would be in it as Mace's son, but rather if they decide they want to use Garlan Tyrell he could be altered to be a cousin of Loras'. Therefore not affecting the inheritance matter.
2194	White Harbors Wrath	2014-05-13	The Rat Cook glamoured as Anguy, glamoured as a red herring.
2195	Gneisenau	2014-05-13	Where are the Tyrells seated in the trials ?
Â 
All those Loras shots were really supposed to be mainly about Marge's reaction, so maybe the mysterious is just a generic nobleman (depending on where the Tyrells sat).
2196	Sultan of Westeros	2014-05-13	Aside from this character who is obviously someone of importance from reach, I also got a glimpse of twin brothers sitting on bench in throne room just when they were bringing Tyrion in, must be Redwyne twins.
2197	King Tommen	2014-05-13	I can't really tell who's joking (which is most of the smart posters I believe) and who's actually seriously debating that this is an established character but for those who are in the latter camp....
Â 
No one has been cast as Garlan, Aurane Waters, Randyl Tarly etc (in S4 anyways). That person you see sitting in that scene is an uncredited extra which means they aren't a real actor otherwise they would have to be credited. So they can't be used in the future to play any kind of significant role (ie. speaking) because they aren't qualified to.
Â 
It's an extra. If you want to imagine they're a character you like, please do so but understand that this means that the character will never to anything more than sit around in the background of a scene and never open their mouth because that's all that gentleman is qualified to do.

2199	TheHouseHB	2014-05-13	Maybe in future seasons the Tyrells can be like oh yeah we had a bastard brother named Garlan that we kept hidden.
2200	Daktura Nurovaia	2014-05-13	For the record, I was totally joking, but I'm now also totally with the poster who suggested Howland Reed, it makes perfect sense...
2201	Hot Kidney Pie	2014-05-13	My first thought was Garlan.. But nahhh..
Aurane Waters would be interesting.. Though I thought he would FOR SURE be cut from the show.
My money goes on *Random Tyrell* until he gets upgraded.Â 
Just think about Tommen and Myrcella etc etc.. They were literally just THERE doing nothing.
Perfectly fine for this guy to just be standing there for now.
They don't usually show people like that though if they aren't planning on using them later on.

Â 
Myrcella and Tommen were cast. Even if they didn't have speaking roles initially, the roles were auditioned for and cast and announced by HBO well before they even filmed. None of the characters you have mentioned have been cast so they aren't on the show yet. The guy who is sitting there in the scene is uncredited and is therefore an extra and not an actor.
Â 
They show extras sitting around to fill out big affairs (Iike a trial or a wedding) all the time. He's nobody. Maybe he's supposed to be some Tyrell cousin of some sort but he's certainly not going to play any kind of role later on because he's not a real actor and wouldn't be able to handle that responsibility.

But, for sure you can see Lady Taena of Myr hiding in Cersei's hair when she's testifying. Pause it and you'll see.

Lol.. Just L-O-L .. FUNNY GUY HERE!
2211	Hot Kidney Pie	2014-05-13	How can you say CERTAINLY just because he's not on the cast list? What are you looking at, IMDB?
And how do you know of this guy's capabilities.. (LOL)
Are you close with him? Or could you tell just from him standing there?
You must have Asperger syndrome or something.. I feel for ya big guy.
And I NEVER said Tommen and Myrcella were not 'cast'. You're telling me this like I don't know?
I just meant that they just had about the same bearing on scenes(at the time) as this *Random Tyrell* did. (none at all)
That just because he didn't really do anything other than stand there DOES NOT mean that he could have a more important role later on..
That's ALL I was trying to say.
You misunderstood.
Of course they show extras all the time.. Once again you say this like your the only one with this *grand knowledge*... LORD HELP ME!
They don't always show them seated with Margaery and Loras though as if he were an equal.
You may be correct and probably are on this matter..
I just refuse to take YOUR word for it.(or your word.. That you read somewhere)

2212	RenlyTheOneTrueKing	2014-05-13	You seem like a tool.
Regardless, I think it is just a random extra to show there are more Tyrells than just those focused on. Almost like Selyse, His character may get named, but if so he will probably be recast. 
Maybe it's Garlan Tyrell, the now nephew?
Maybe, Aurane or maybe just a new character. Who knows?
2213	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-13	They really Dun Goof'd making Loras an elder brother LOL. Might be a bastard Garlan.Â
2214	ipsuel	2014-05-13	Didn't read the whole thread but the guy sitting next to them is the Royal Steward -- we saw him in S01 alot... At least, that's who I thought it was when I saw him. He turns toward the camera at one point and you get a really good look.
2215	ipsuel	2014-05-13	Ok, just checked and yes, it wasÂ Robert Sterne... imdb has him in this episode.
2216	DaveyJoe	2014-05-13	So you're saying Robert Sterne plays Garlan Tyrell? Â Interesting.
2217	ipsuel	2014-05-13	Lol please tell me you're being facetious 
Â 
ETA: The guy is also a casting director so it looks like he's credited for every episode... Hmm, so now I'm not 100% sure, lol, but I'm still sticking with Royal Steward. Had no idea it was in doubt til seeing the thread; I assumed we all knew who it was. Ah well.. no matter.

Classy.Â 
What an annoyingly written pile of crap. And anyone who pays any remote attention to either the the casting news during the off season, or indeed the show itself, would know that Garlan Tyrell is pretty much confirmed as cut. This guy is literally random Tyrell extra added for shot symmetry and nothing more. Tommen and Myrcella both had multiple (very small) speaking parts and were identified by other characters. This guy does not, no matter how much you might want him to.Â 
This reminds me of Asha's scene in 3x10 when an alarming amount of people thought that the random scary-looking dude behind her was either Euron or Victarion. Not everyone is someone. If you genuinely believe this guy is anyone other than a random extra, it shows you know nothing about basic components of TV production.Â
2219	King Tommen	2014-05-13	Robert Sterne is part of the casting department for GoT. They threw him a bone by letting him be a Royal Page in S1, didn't think they'd had him back since then but I guess they wanted to fill out the seats for the trial.

'It shows you know nothing about basic components of TV production'..

Haven't been boning up on my Garlan casting news lately! Shame on me! Shame the fuck on me!

Let me repeat... NOBODY CARES ABOUT GARLAN!
You've missed my point completely..
Never should have used the Tommen/Myrcella comparison.. You people just can't seem to get past that.
It was a bad comparison. Would you like me to go back and edit it for you? Would that make you feel better?
I do apologize for the Asperger's comment.. That was over the line. Probably insulted like half the fan base there..Â

If they decide to make Garlan an important character later on, they will just throw him in there. They don't have to plant extras in significant positions and then later on try to build them up later on -- if they decide to introduce a new character, they are not limited by any kind of legal or narrative structure to use only actors who have appeared before in the series. It's fun to speculate as to who random extras could be though.

Â 
Now that is funny..
This is allll I was doing! Just pure speculation on my part.
My fault for NOT keeping up on the Garlan casting news!! Seriously, MY BAD..
I've learned my lesson!
So shoot me for not being aware that Garlan was not 'officially cast'.Â 
Though.. I never actually implied that I thought that he was.Â 
And I said that I was almost FOR SURE Aurane would be cut..Â 
Though literally all I said was "My first thought was Garlan.. but Nahh"
I'm paraphrasing, but that's alllllll that I said.
My initial thought was that it was Garlan, but then I thought otherwise.Â 
I was eluding to Aurane because he was previously mentioned.
It's the Tommen/Myrcella comparison that threw it all off.Â 
You can't tell me that they may as well NOT HAVE been there in the first season though.Â 
Could have saved the money and just mentioned them and had the exact same effect.Â 
I was just saying they had the same bearing on the story at that point as this random Tyrell did this Sunday.
WHICH WAS NONE AT ALL. They may as well have been extras.. Other than the breakfast scene with Tyrion, did they do anything in season 1?
The only difference is they were officially cast. Which I FULLY understand.Â 
~UNDERSTAND THAT I FULLY UNDERSTAND~
Though, it really.....really... does...not.....matter. Like... At all. Which is partly why I got so flustered.Â 
Why go out of your way to point out such a small detail?? Â 
So shoot me for not being aware that Garlan was not 'officially cast'.Â

The guy in the pic, OP, is not Robert Sterne. I thought this was an interesting explanation, but then I looked at the pictures and they don't match.
So this is someone else.
It may be a random extra, but I maintain that the show often shows characters soon to appear with real roles as cameos first. If that's the case here, it is not Garlan.

2227	daggerseiuri	2014-05-14	My guess would be Aurane Waters.
Garlan was completely cut from the show I think.
Aurane's part in the story is coming up soon so it makes sense for the show to give us a peek of him now. They did the same thing for Tommen at the beginning of the season: show him standing around at Joff's wedding but not saying anything before his part begins.

No way, man, Aurane very specifically resembles Rhaegar (according to Cersei) with green eyes. Or did I misread?
2228	Ser Not Appearing	2014-05-14	First name Easter, last name Egg.
2229	King Tommen	2014-05-14	It may be a random extra, but I maintain that the show often shows characters soon to appear with real roles as cameos first. If that's the case here, it is not Garlan.


Â 
Can you give an example of an uncredited character later appearing as a real one ever on this show? I'm pretty sure that's never happened.
2230	Hippocras	2014-05-15	No way, man, Aurane very specifically resembles Rhaegar (according to Cersei) with green eyes. Or did I misread?

He's also not the dreamiest and Aurane is supposed to be pretty dreamy. Still, glimpses of characters before they start having lines is very normal for the show. So it might be someone we will meet and not an extra.
2231	Matoro	2014-05-15	I can't really tell who's joking (which is most of the smart posters I believe) and who's actually seriously debating that this is an established character but for those who are in the latter camp....

Â 

There was Wendel Mandelry in the Red Wedding as an uncredited extra (he had merman brooch and glorious mustache and everything.) Unfortunately he died. Of course this doesen't mean that this mysterious Tyrell should be anything, but there's always possibility.
Â 
I want to believe he is Garlan Flowers.

Â

Â 
Wendel Manderly was announced as being cast before that season started. We heard about that back when they were filming S3.
Â 
I'm sorry if this is coming off snooty but some of us follow casting and filming stuff very closely though the off-season when others maybe aren't playing as close attention. And there has never been a time where a character major or minor has appeared on the show where their casting hasn't been determined earlier.
Â 
So believe me when I say that this random dude is not a character that means anything. He's probably there because the director thought Marge and Loras looked a little lonely sitting by themselves and wanted to fill out their area for the shooting of the scene.
Â 
If you're looking for info on minor characters who are still yet to appear this season, we've got:
Â 
Lady Waynwood, Lyn Corbray and Yohn Royce (the Lords Declarant)
a Braavosi ship captain (who everyone assumes will be the one Arya interacts with to go to Braavos in the finale)
a dying man in the Riverlands (who Arya and the Hound give the gift of mercy to)
Bloodraven
A Child of the Forest (not specifically Leaf but probably the substitute for her)
Ralf Kenning (Ironborn commander at Moat Cailin)
Â 
The one thing that's trickier to ascertain is just what minor characters or guest stars could be returning in a season as that information is not usually released and you either have the actors confirming it themselves or maybe you can tell from their online resume if they're coming back as well:
Â 
We know for certain that the following are returning who have not yet appeared:
The Mountain (duh)
Rorge and Biter
Mance
Â 
You kind of assume that other characters like Balon, the BwB and LS are returning but there's no way of knowing because they clearly want those appearances to be a surprise if they're happening.
Â 
But new characters? We always know about them well ahead of the season start.

No problem. Here was the article: http://winteriscomin...asting-updates/
2235	DaveyJoe	2014-05-15	I typically follow the casting, but I missed Lyn Corbray, could you tell me who is playing him?
2236	ambi76	2014-05-15	The character isn't called Lyn Corbray on the show but Vance Corbray.
2237	Rain of Castamere	2014-05-15	his clothes look like tyrell

Y'know, this is a show that's developed a reputation for recasting characters...


Â 
But in those cases, we've still known clearly who the original character is before the recast (ie Beric, Tommen etc). This is uncredited. It's a dude sitting in a chair. If they wanted him to be an actual character, he would have been named. He's not. Let your imagination run wild with who this might be in your fanfiction but on the show, it's nobody.

This.
Â 
I was really disappointed they put extras up there. It made no sense to me to see 3 goons next to Cersei who didn't even testify.
Â 
And if it's so they could recast that extra later, then by that same logic they would have put extras in the Meereeneese throne room this same episode, but they didn't. Because it wasn't needed.
2241	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-15	<REWIND. PLAY>

I think the clothes that GARLAN TYRELL wears there are quite fitting and very elegant. He looks better on them than Loras, HIS BROTHER.

2244	GHOSTSTARK	2014-05-20	i thought that was the older Tyrell but would be weird to bring him in out of no whereÂ like that
2245	Mad Monkey	2014-05-20	Based on the current episode, I think it's now feasible to speculate that this is Bowen Marsh, who was sent by the Wall to King's Landing to get assistance.
2246	Kaspiro	2014-05-05	The preview for the next episode makes it pretty evident that Asha (Yara) finally reaches the Dreadfort to free Theon, and she and Ramsay confront one another. Since the entire 'Asha attempts to free Theon' plot is a show-only storyline, the ending to this plot is still somewhat open to speculation. How exactly is that going to work itself out? If I were to guess I'd think that since Asha, Theon and Ramsay are still all alive in the books, they will likely all leave the encounter relatively unscathed. The real question is whether or not Asha will succeed in freeing Theon. Will she overcome Ramsay long enough to free him, only to be captured herself and brought to the Wall in order to re-merge her storyline with her book counterpart's? Or will Theon remain a captive, and be freed later on?Â
2247	14ccKemistk	2014-05-05	Yara and Theon might escape and run for Moat Cailin where Theon gets re-captured by Ramsay. Yara flees (again) to Deepwood Motte.
2248	Jamie Lannister	2014-05-05	Prediction: The rescue attempt fails, but Asha kills Myranda and escapes with any surviving Ironborn. Ramsay takes his anger out on Theon and we see full Reek-mode engaged.Â
2249	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-05-05	Do we actually see Ramsey and Yara facing each other in the preview? I thought Ramsey was in Moat Cailin, so why would Yara go there? I think she'll arrive at the Dreadfort and find it empty (Roose having left to Winterfell or Barrowton, maybe) or she will barely escape from Roose
Â 
Eh, I don't knowÂ
2250	NightStark	2014-05-05	Are those Ramsay's 'Bastard Boys' with him?
Â 
I want Damon Dance-for-Me..what a name.

Â 
We don't see them interact in the trailer, but we do see a) Theon being guarded by a group of Ironborn while Ramsay and his boys charge them, and  Asha threatening some guard about Theon's location in what looks like the same place.
Â

2253	Hath4	2014-05-05	Yes yara attacks the dreadfort and frees reek. But ramsay and his goons storm in and it leads to a big battle in his bitches kennels.
2254	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-05	I largely see Yara vs. Ramsay as much as inconsequential filler as Craster's Keep was.
2255	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-05-05	I largely see Yara vs. Ramsay as much as inconsequential filler as Craster's Keep was.


Only if Yara escapes and goes back to the Islands as if nothing happened. If she is captured, it depends on what they do with her. If she dies, it definitely affects Reek long-term, so it wouldn't be filler.
2256	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-05	Well I mean to say, I've yet to see any nonbook material this season that is pushing the story in a different direction like that. It's either enhancing the storyline (Margaery visiting Tommen's bed) or is having no effect (i.e. Craster's Keep).
2257	Arkash	2014-05-05	I doubt it will be the same as Craster's actions.
Â 
For the Wall, they had to create a short-term story arc before tying back to the books with the preparations and battle.
Â 
There, with Yara and the Dreadfort they have much more time to "eventually" cover up (unless it magically ends back on Kingsmoot / Winterfell wedding by the end of the season) so I'm curious about what's in store.
2258	go joff go	2014-05-05	It's all the more interesting because it's such a big domino in how many up in the air storylines will play out.
2259	Asshai by the Shadow	2014-05-05	Prediction: The rescue attempt fails, but Asha kills Myranda and escapes with any surviving Ironborn. Ramsay takes his anger out on Theon and we see full Reek-mode engaged.Â 


how much more reek can he get? He is already as broken down as possible minus the missing fingers and broken teeth. Â I hope Asha escapes though. Theon will definitely not escape we see him go to Moat Cailin in the trailers.Â
2260	franko99	2014-05-05	Honestly, even if it's just "filler" as some of you say, it is a really good and entertaining one, give me that over more randomly sassy talk in KL, Dany "badass" one-liners, or if we go by the books, Tyrion watching turtles and Brienne's adventures with Nimble Dick...
2261	DarkerStar	2014-05-05	Are we sure it's the Dreadfort where we see Yara and Ramsay? Ramsay was sent to Moat Cailin by his father. Roose doesn't seem to me like the kind of man who would accept disobedience. If Locke had time to get to the Wall and be a respected recruit by episode 4, I assume Ramsay and Reek should have had time to get to the Neck.
2262	King Tommen	2014-05-05	Are we sure it's the Dreadfort where we see Yara and Ramsay? Ramsay was sent to Moat Cailin by his father. Roose doesn't seem to me like the kind of man who would accept disobedience. If Locke had time to get to the Wall and be a respected recruit by episode 4, I assume Ramsay and Reek should have had time to get to the Neck.


Â 
It definitely is the Dreadfort and Roose didn't specify that Ramsay had to go to Moat Cailin immediately so we're ok here.
Â 
If you're having a tougher time with the logistics of this, let's assume that Roose needs the requisite time to head back down South to gather his armies and is trying to time the Moat Cailin surrender with his march back up North so Ramsay needs to wait a little bit before he leaves.
2263	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-05-05	My best case scenario is Asha strikes the Dreadfort when Theon is with Ramsey in Moat Callin....she then retreats after she lerns his brother is not there...Canon is hurt as little as posible.
2264	King Tommen	2014-05-05	My best case scenario is Asha strikes the Dreadfort when Theon is with Ramsey in Moat Callin....she then retreats after she lerns his brother is not there...Canon is hurt as little as posible.


Â 
Then you're going to be disappointed because there's a shot in the preview of Yara and Theon at the Dreadfort together facing off with Ramsay in the hallway.
Â 
You're honestly worried about canon at this point?
2265	go joff go	2014-05-05	One thing that's hard to reconcile with the preview is that we have seen a glimpse of bloodied ramsey with theon in his cage, presumably before yara gets to him.  My theory is that theon is let go but will somehow betray yara.
2266	Arkash	2014-05-05	I can see this storyline going that way :
Â 
Ep 6 - Yara attacks the Dreadfort. Mission fails, she falls back. I'm wondering who will she talk to, she necessarly needs another character to interract among her crew. Crossing fingers for Tristifer Botley !
Â 
Ep 8 - Yara decides to take refuge at the main Iron Born bastion in the North : Moat Cailin. We meet Ralf Kenning (who was cast) there. Ramsay decides it is time to be done with the Moat.
Â 
Ep 10 - Moat Cailin event. The Moat is taken. Roose and troop - Ramsay reunion. Yara escapes once again, maybe pressenting some fucked up betrayal and getting the hell out of there as soon as possible. I even wonder if the finale could not show us her return to the Iron Islands and the death of Balon. Or, for not being too much of a pointless arc, she takes another Northern place (Deepwood Motte ?).

Â 
Interesting, I like a lot of that. I could see it happening similarly but with a few changes:
Ep 6. Roose heads out at the beginning and is like "you better get on that whole Moat Cailin thing before I'm back". That night, Yara attacks and there's the standoff. Reek betrays her somehow, maybe in like a "which owner will the puppy go to?" type scenario. Yara escapes. I think somehow this demonstration of Reek's loyalty gives Ramsay the idea for how to take the Moat.
Ep 8. Yara gets to Moat Cailin, but gets news of Balon's death and leaves some folks in charge. Just after she leaves, Reek and Ramsay show up. Reek treats with the Ironborn (or maybe that will be in 10)
Ep 10. Ramsay takes the moat. Roose shows up and is like "good job, I'm going to legitimize you. let's all go to Winterfell and celebrate." I definitely think the storyline will culminte with Ramsay's legitimization as McElhatton has said in interviews that their story this season is weirdly moving towards the end.
2268	King Tommen	2014-05-05	I see no logical reason why they would have Yara come all the way to the Dreadfort only to immediately go to Moat Caitlin and then immediately go back to Pyke.Â  If they wanted her to be in Pyke, they would have left her there and not sent her on a mission where she accomplishes nothing. If they wanted her to be in Moat Cailin, they would have sent her to Moat Cailin (to substitute for Deepwood Motte). I'm not sure how she even "retreats" from the Dreadfort without getting on the boat she came there on and if she does that, she isn't going to end up anywhere close to a central location like Moat Cailin. Unless perhaps she's going to jog there?
Â 
I know fans really, really want her to be back in Pyke for the Kingsmoot and are twisting themselves in knots trying to work backwards from that notion but dramatically, the minute they sent her on this mission, it signaled that they wanted to majorly alter her storyline.

2270	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-05-06	I just want a christmas special episode with the only ironborn and Kingsmoot 


Kingsmoot is now solely a Victarion/Euron pissing contest. Cue the misogyny complaints over removing the female from the succession and making it about the men.

Â 
Point taken, although the producers aren't opposed to a little bit of circular storytelling to keep characters relevent (ie: everything with Karl and Craster's keep). As far as getting back by land, yes, it would take a while, but she could find certainly get her hands on a horse. That being said, I agree it's also likely they've got something completely different up their sleeve. I could also see Theon Â himself being forced to ransom Yara as a hostage at Moat Cailin, if she's captured this Sunday. Either way, I just can't imagine they'll kill her off in her first episode back, especially given how big a moment they made of her return in Mhysa. Whatever it is, we'll all know soon.

2272	Carl Drogo	2014-05-06	I have been wondering how this storyline will play out.Â  In the preview for episode 6, did anybody find it a little over the top that Ramsay would charge a fully armed and armored group of ironmen (50 best killers in the iron islands) with no shirt and just two knives? I don't normally have many "Aww that doesn't work" moment with this series, but for some reason I found this to be off. Anytime you play that scenario out for real, you know Ramsey is toast.
2273	Koi No Yokan	2014-05-06	I'll be disappointed if Asha is removed from the Kingsmoot, but I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing considering she eventually ends up in the North anyway. I'd love to see Asha face off against her uncles though, because I think it's an important moment for her character; and she would be a great POV into the beginning of the Ironborn story (as Ellaria will be to Dorne).
Â 
I'd sort of hoped that she wouldn't find Theon, so I could eventually get my reunion outside the walls of Winterfell, but that looks to be thrown out the window (I'm not expecting a more physical transformation with Reek). Just have to see how it pans out I guess. Still, I'm happy we're finally getting Asha in the mix of things - and killing Bolton men, no less!

Or, for not being too much of a pointless arc, she takes another Northern place (Deepwood Motte ?).


In the show Yara took Deepwood Motte and we haven't heard anything about the Northmen retaking it, so she most likely has a garrison there. Roose Bolton even said, that he'll need his forces to come to the North to retake his lands from the Greyjoy's so I doubt that Moat Cailan is the last bastion. I like the idea of her failing to free Theon and retreating to Moat Cailan though. Ralf could tell her about Balon's dead, Euron arriving and Victarion leaving for the Isles. By this point the audience will most likely have a new found liking to Yara, and they'll enjoy the Kingsmoot more with her there. After the failed Kingsmoot she could Â sail to Deepwood Motte and be captured by Stannis like in the books.
2275	KingOfTheRock	2014-05-06	What if Asha/Yara takes the place of Jeyne Poole?
2276	Guard of the Rainking	2014-05-06	What if Asha/Yara takes the place of Jeyne Poole?


The beauty of Jeyne Poole is how innocent she is. Yara is too full of fight and we already have one reekyfied Greyjoy. Also Yara is Ironborn and many have seen her raiding and what not. The North would notice that it's not Arya in no time.
2277	Koi No Yokan	2014-05-06	What if Asha/Yara takes the place of Jeyne Poole?


Â 
No.
2278	Natalie Underfoot	2014-05-06	I feel like they decided to hit pause on the Balon storyline for this season and this is the consequence. Â Also, I can't remember and have lent my books out but did Asha and Balon know that Theon was alive? Â This whole thing seems like a way to endear us to Asha and to keep the Greyjoy's in their mind.
Â 
My theory: Asha goes there, fighting commences, something occurs where she realizes how broken Reek is, she flees and heads to either the Motte or back home. Ramsey takes Moat Cailin and the season ends with Greyjoy's death and the site of Euron's ships moving towards Pyke
2279	Stannis Eats No Peaches	2014-05-06	Not at all bothered about fidelity at this point, but I'm going to have to suspend disbelief when it comes to Yara taking the Iron Fleet around Westeros and then launching an attack on the Dreadfort. Though I suppose it's not as ridiculous as Theon taking Winterfell with 20 men, and that happened in the book.
2280	toffeejay	2014-05-06	I can't see her dying in ep 6 as some have predicted. What would be the point of not appearing from the middle of season 2 to the final episode of 3 with a big speech and then just get killed off?
Â 
As seems to be the general consesus here it has to be:
Â 
6. Fails to resuce Theon (Reek's stockholm syndrome siding with Ramsay).
8. Retreats to the Moat. Ralf tells her Balon is dead, Euron crownedÂ and Victarion has left. - Possibly see her leaving for Pyke?.
10. Possibly see her leaving for Pyke? Theon gets the garrison to surrender.
Â 
Problems:
if things were so bad why would the garrison not leave with Asha?
Balons death? - a snippet for episode 7 or perhaps they don't show? I'd prefer it if they did - a glimpse of a faceless man and a pretender King deserves an on screen death.
2281	veto	2014-05-06	if nothing comes of it like the crasters keep storyline , then you have to ask , whats the point ?
2282	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-05-06	Kingsmoot is now solely a Victarion/Euron pissing contest. Cue the misogyny complaints over removing the female from the succession and making it about the men.sweet summer child.. .are you so sure they are giving us a Victarion?
2283	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-06	Whatever happens, it can't be as jarring as when Yara and Balon suddenly appeared on their own in "Mhysa" after having missed the whole season.
2284	Chebyshov	2014-05-06	sweet summer child.. .are you so sure they are giving us a Victarion?


Â 
...and a Kingsmoot for that matter.
2285	DaveyJoe	2014-05-06	Yeah, the thing about Meereen's navy has me worried that Victarion might be cut.Â  We got a Prince Doran name drop and Oberyn even mentioned the sand snakes, but we haven't heard anything about the Greyjoys yet.Â  It's going to be very interesting to see how the Ironborn stuff plays out over the next few episodes.
2286	Arkash	2014-05-06	By this point the audience will most likely have a new found liking to Yara, and they'll enjoy the Kingsmoot more with her there.Â 
Â 

Â 
You are raising a very interesting point here : I wonder if the whole point of Yara's arc this season is to make the viewer enjoy her and root for her to create emotional investment to the Kingsmoot. Even if some would call this arc pointless if she returns for Kingsmoot, it would show her under a great light and prepare us for a great Kingsmoot on TV.
Â 
And as long as there is Tristifer Botley, it would rock ! ^^
Â 
EDIT : Long-shot wish but I'd love if Yara was to be back at Pyke for episode 10 to end her season arc on the sails of the Silence appearing at the horizon and her talking about Euron Greyjoy to someone (Tristifer ! ... Nope, I wont stop ! ^^).
Â 
I wonder how on-screen Balon's death could happen in all of this. Maybe intro of episode 8, something visual and silent (the storm, the bridge, the silhouette, could be a great intro to the episode).Â

If Yara retreats to Moat Cailan, then it could be the opening of the episode where the Moat makes it's debut. For example if Yara would come to Moat Cailan in episode 8 the first scene of the episode would be Balon falling from a bridge followed by a shot of Silence sailing into Pyke. Later during the episode they could have Ralf Kenning telling Yara that Victarion has sailed back to Pyke because of what has happened.

Â 
Precisely. He's been humbled to shit but he hasn't been, well, gimped yet. I get that it's not practical to literally beat the guy senseless, but he still seems too assuming and assertive. Reek needs to be a snivelling wreck, or him finding himself again won't be as powerful.
2292	Aenton Harlaw	2014-05-06	It has been mentioned before but i'll have to emphasize that the promo might be playing with the expectations of unsullied + giving the readers something to discuss by cutting Dreadfort and Cailin scenes together.
I've watched the first seconds a few times and i'm not sure what to believe. If it weren't for the "this is turning into a lovely evening line", i'd be more up for that theory though.
Anyways, I won't be surprised If R & R are at MC next week while Asha infiltrates the DF in vain.
Also, who does Ramsay go full-Belwas on before that scene ?!
Â
2293	Konradsmith	2014-05-06	^No because Yara and her men clearly have Reek in that shot in the promo.

2296	Aenton Harlaw	2014-05-06	Is Yara attacking the DF a given.Why cant it be the Moat?


Â 
Don't think so, because for all she knows, MC is held by Ironborn and Theon is held captive by the Boltons (at the DF)

Either Yara rescues him and legs it to Moat Caillin where Ramsay follows and somehow defeats the Ironborn and re-captures Theon
Â 
OR
Â 
Yara fails to rescue to Theon and Ramsay uses him (Theon) to go and Â trick the Ironborn into surrendering Moat Caillin
Â 
Its possible if Yara's character doesnt do anything significant in the yet to be published books that HBO may kill her off during the Dreadfort rescue attempt?
Â 
I'm so intrigued to see the Dreadfort scene next week!

Check 00:12 of that same trailer. I willing to bet that that's Theon riding into Moat Cailan.

I was just gonna say that.

Also Theon's armor looks like it has some red in it. That looks like a Bolton thing
2300	Dornishwoman's Husband	2014-05-06	It looks like Ramsay is going to fight Yara's Ironmen in the next episode. It would be a little bit strange if he survive that, because in the books Roose once said to Theon that Ramsay swings the sword like a buther hacking meat, which would mean he's a poor sword fighter.

Also, it might just be clever editing, but he's charging against "the best killers on the Isles" with no shield or even armor.
2302	NightStark	2014-05-06	I was just gonna say that.
Â 
Also Theon's armor looks like it has some red in it. That looks like a Bolton thing


Â 
Nah, it's just the colour of the armour. Here's a shot of Theon in Winterfell with it;

2303	toffeejay	2014-05-06	Could be clever editing and actually two different scenes but going from the lighting it has to be one scene.
So we have Asha with 5 men and Theon. They backed into a dead end. Ramsay with 5/6 men at the door.
Reckon we'll end up with everyone dead except Ramsay and Asha. Perhaps she bests Ramsay but Theon refuses to leave?
2304	Jamie Lannister	2014-05-06	It looks like Ramsay is going to fight Yara's Ironmen in the next episode. It would be a little bit strange if he survive that, because in the books Roose once said to Theon that Ramsay swings the sword like a buther hacking meat, which would mean he's a poor sword fighter.


Â 
That's Book!Ramsay though. Show!Ramsay (who executed like six guys in 20 seconds) strikes me as a much better fighter than his book counterpart.Â

oh shit, your right, nvm.
2306	StandOzone	2014-05-06	I find unjustifiedÂ the fear for cutting Greyjoys. Yes, we have heard about Sunspear, Water Gardens, Doran Martell, Myrcella and the Sand Snakes. For sure we will get the Dornish plot next year. But that doesn't mean that the Iron Islands plot will be scrapped. Euron has a dragon horn!!! Please, I bet it will be useful for playing with the Dany's children. Besides, Tyrion mentioned that Theon's uncles attacked Lannisport, so, for sure two Theon's uncles do exist in the show. However, the ironborn are very poorly explored in the show, and for afford the season 5 D&D need to sow some interest in them, that justified the Dreadfort plot.
Â 
For 4x06, I think that Yara will find a chained Theon. Then, she tell his brother that they will take him to Moat Cailin where they would meet their uncle Victarion (check-in), but Reek will refuse to go with them, telling them that Ramsay will attack the Moat Cailin. Facing a reluctant man, Yara will give up her mission but not before killing Myranda and some Bolton's men. She and some ironborn will flee in horses to Moat Cailin, but the Boltons will force them to change the route departing to Deepwood Mott instead (if not the first choice).
Â 
I'm joining to those who want to see the Balon's death, but I believe we won't. Gods be good, I hope I'm wrong. That will be a perfect first scene for 4x07 or 4x08, then we must see Yara arriving to Deepwood Mott. There, an ironborn informs her that Victarion left Moat Cailin to Pyke (leaving Ralf Kenning under the command) because her father died and Euron returned (check-in). If we are lucky, then the ironborn will continue saying that Aeron (check-in) call for a Kingsmoot, so, this will be the last scene of Yara these season, but then the show will give us the Moat Cailin plot as was in the books.

2307	Arkash	2014-05-06	^ Good point. I have a good feeling we will start getting some Greyjoy name-drop next episode, really curious to hear how they bring them up !
2308	ToTheWolves	2014-05-06	I repeat again - it only has no effect because you know what's going to bloody happen. Show watchers had every reason to believe Jon could die in that knife fight. also someone pointed out that they needed a reason for the nights watch to rally behind jon and choose him as lord commander later. You know they need to show him as a leader and what not.
2309	DaveyJoe	2014-05-06	I told my friends that I was excited about Jon's excursion to Craster's Keep because that didn't happen in the books. Â Then they got pissed at me saying "so I guess that means Jon survives it!?" Â I guess I'll be keeping my mouth shut about deviations in the future...
2310	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-06	Prediction: The rescue attempt fails, but Asha kills Myranda and escapes with any surviving Ironborn. Ramsay takes his anger out on Theon and we see full Reek-mode engaged.Â 


I like this. I'm hoping this is the case.Â
2311	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-06	Â 
Precisely. He's been humbled to shit but he hasn't been, well, gimped yet. I get that it's not practical to literally beat the guy senseless, but he still seems too assuming and assertive. Reek needs to be a snivelling wreck, or him finding himself again won't be as powerful.


This.
2312	Bold Barry Whitebeard	2014-05-06	It seems hard to believe that they are not going to have Ramsay and Reek retake Moat Caillan, unless they have the iron born abandon it to focus on the Kingsmoot.
Â 
What I'd like to see is the escape fail, Asha gets captured.Â  Then at some point Ramsay decides to hunt Asha, and realizes to his chagrin that Asha isn't prey, and she kills him.
2313	iheartseverus	2014-05-06	Just saw this screencap at NeoGAF.Â  Have we seen this yet?Â  Asha/Yara rescuing Theon.Â

Â 
I think its in the preview. Destroys any notion that Asha/Yara are in one place, and Ramsey in another.
Â 
I also REALLY don't think Asha/Yara is going back to Pyke. Think she is staying in the north.
2315	Konradsmith	2014-05-06	It is in the promo. If they have himÂ there that doesn't bode well for how they will all end up.

2316	Koi No Yokan	2014-05-07	I'm kinda worried.Â
2317	Konradsmith	2014-05-07	Maybe Ramsay will take a leaf from his father's book and let her go (a la Jaime) instead of killing her.
2318	The brown snake	2014-05-07	I hope the Greyjoys see each other. And know who each other is.
But I have learnt never to hope for anything on game of thrones.
2319	hedgeknight001	2014-05-07	It's all the more interesting because it's such a big domino in how many up in the air storylines will play out.Yep -- my wife the unsullied actually said during the fight at Craster's, "If Bran is killed I'm going to stop watching." She was on edge not knowing what would happen, and not wanting to see (another) child murder. I kind of looked at her funny, but then it immediately struck me that unsullied really don't know what is in store for each character. Any of them could die (Ned, RW, Joffrey).
So, Craster's and the other scenes brought up in the same vein aren't "filler" any more so than book characters are "filler."

2320	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-07	That's got to be some kind of Tristifer Botley or Qarl the Maid (which one is likelier??). There's a clear shot of him behind Yara on the rowboat, then in the shot of Yara/Theon/Greyjoy soldiers he is not wearing a helmet like the others (don't use above screencap for reference, watch preview). They only take off helmets, when it's a character, right? Like Jaime the Lord Commander and Meryn Trant never wear their helmets (except Meryn vs Syrio) but the rest of the Kingsguard always do.
Â 
Yara's male friend is carrying a giant weapon. What is it? An axe? Do Tristifer or Qarl have a signature weapon?
Â 
Yara dying is really unlikely, and if she gets a supporting character in this episode, it's even unlikelier, isn't it? I guess getting captured is still up in the air, but Ramsay wouldn't let anyone else live. So then, why bring Tristifer/Qarl in? Ramsay's not like Stannis who spared her men after Deepwood Motte. Is it to show Ramsay is evil? I think him slaughtering the other 49 of the Iron Islands best killers is good enough of that.

2321	Beric175	2014-05-07	I stand by what I said: Yara= Arya. She's gonna be fArya so that theÂ Ironborn leave the Boltons alone and it'd be a nice twist later on when Ramsay forces Theon to abuse his sister sexually, when in season 2 Theon did so willingly and so this could potentially showcase his different attitude towards her, where here he would be much more reluctant. Sure, she's not gonna be at the Kingsmoot but in the book she loses anyway and so they can have that one without her.

2322	Beric175	2014-05-07	The room they're in does not seem like you can escape by jumping out of a window so unless Ramsay dies, which he's not, Yara will get captured at best, at worst tortured to death or flayed or both, with Theon completing his Reek transformation as a result of witnessing it.

2323	Hath4	2014-05-07	The fight occurs in the kennels where ramsay keeps reek and his bitches. so it is probably close to the exit. I wonder if the dogs will play a role in the fight. as for yara if she captured she will not be psychically tortured sense ramsay knows roose would want her whole. she would be psychologically tortured.
2324	boojam	2014-05-07	Is Yara attacking the DF a given.Why cant it be the Moat?Yeah that is what I was thinking too, tho how would she know he's there?Why does Ramsay looks so trashed out? As if he has already been in some fighting and kind of got the worst of it?Here's an odd note. In the books Roose cleans Theon/Reek up and sends him to Moat Cailin to get the Ironborn there to surrender. Season's 4 'general' trailer seems to show Theon back in his old armor, tho it's brief, I guess on this mission.We don't see that in the preview for E6.So maybe it is the Dreadfort? Before Ramsay leaves, and then he doesn't leave?

2325	Hath4	2014-05-07	ramsay is shitless because right before the attack he is having sex with myranda. the blood on his chest his most likely from her. He probably kills her. And yes it's at the dreadfort.

Tris - An interestering book character, flawed and one of the most realistic characters GRRM has wrote. Love sick and caring. He's like Sam but is fairlyÂ good lookingÂ and can fight.
Or KarlÂ - hansom, dull brute, sounds a little metrosexual, Asha's lover.
Any other show would go with Tris, D&D will no doubt use Karl to add Gemma Whelan to their nudity checklist.

I don't see it working but after the overkill of media (most ofÂ whom don't appear to even watch the show)Â on the sept rape scene it would actuallyÂ be funny if theyÂ respondedÂ by havingÂ had a geldedÂ Theon being forced to perform oral on his ownÂ sister.

Â 
Soooo... Yara manages to free Theon, at least for a while, according to the promo ! I hope the emotion of their meeting is not lost in the show (I'm sure Alfie Allen's physical transformation will end here) and if Theon deliberatly choose to stay with Ramsay, it could make for great TV if handled properly !
2329	Monk Meth-	2014-05-07	Its safe to assume she has already taking deepwood motte and after things go bad she will flee back. even though things in the books are changing. and will keep changing they defining plot points will remain the same. different path same conclusion.

yap, thats my assumption as well...killing her off is highly unlikely, she is an pov in the books and i have a strong feeling her role is important in book 6 (and 7). ramsay capturing her is though possible but also rather unlikely. i think the point in making her a pov (so to speak) in season 4, is to have a (re)introduction in iron best affairs, i really hope we get some name dropping (at least victarion and euron). she probably will flee with some surviving men either to moat cailin or to deepwood motte (which she took in season 2) or perhaps even straight to pyke

I have a theory that she's going to take on Vic's role, and we're only getting Euron (likely no Kingsmoot). But I think you're right that both death and capture seem highly unlikely.Â

Â 
It could happen...we'll have to wait and see. I'm of the mind that regardless of GoT being 7 or 8 seasons, AFFC/ADWD is only going to take up 1 season. I just don't see it working with people's storylines otherwise. As it is now, Bran's in ADWD, Brienne is in AFFC, and after "only Cat," Sansa barely has any plot left.
Â 
But this means they'll have a ton of ground to cover next season. In terms of new characters, they're going to at least partially introduce the Dornish. I'm not convinced we're getting a Quentyn, but we're definitely getting Arianne, Doran, and at least one Sand Snake (maybe more...Oberyn did mention his 8 daughters). Based on last episode, they also foreshadowed Myrcella getting injured, so that's going to take time to show. We're going to be getting Aegon and Griff (through Tyrion), unless he really doesn't amount to a sack of beans in the books (unlikely, IMO).
Â 
I don't think they're going to want to saturate us with new characters; if they have both Vic and Euron, it seems like that may be a click too far. The show will be barely recognizable. Not to mention spending time on something like a Kingsmoot, or explaining Greyjoy politics, just does not seem like a good use of of their already limited screen time. I get that the KL soap opera isn't engaging, but that will hardly be the focus; both Tyrion and Jaime will have left, Tywin will be dead, so other than showing Cersei blowing everything up, there's not much more there. And with some characters, like Jon and Tyrion, they have a lot of ground to cover, so that will take up a good amount of screen time, even if it's not the most titillating. I could be wrong, but I just don't see Greyjoys taking center stage.
Â 
Granted, I don't like the Greyjoys, so I'm sure that's coloring my assumption. But I think given how much they're going to need to include next season, there's going to be a lot on the chopping block. I thought Dorne would be very paired down, but last episode shows set-up for more depth there. And we know how popular Oberyn is in the Unsullied fandom, so I think if they have to choose between Dornish or Ironborn screen time, the former will win out.
Â 
Now, if Aegon is cut, all bets are off. We really won't know until casting news for S5 comes around, though.

Â 
Â 
People are forgetting that this is exactly the case and was a deliberate move by Martin. Books 1 to 3 represent a beginning and an end to major plot lines. From book 4 onwards we are introduced to a whole new cast of characters and plots that will probably be resolved in Book 7. Unless D&D think of ending Game of thrones at season 4, I do not see much of an option here. They have to follow through the major plotlines introduced by Martin.
2338	Bear Claw	2014-05-07	I think thatÂ Yara will either escape without Theon or she will be captured.Â  However, if she is captured I don't think Roose will keep her at the Dreadfort because he wants to keep her as a viable hostage (Ramsey can't be trusted).Â Â  Anyway, I think this is like Craster's and all for not - it will end up very much like it is in the books.
Â 
Could she be fake Arya ?Â Well the letters matchÂ ( Yara/Arya , Â Bael/Able) Â but I really hope not.Â  It would make zero sense.Â  While not everyone in the North knows what Arya looks like, they do know she is young. Younger than Rob and younger than Sansa.Â  How can they pass Yara who is older thanÂ TheonÂ  for Arya.?

God, i hope she doesn't take Vic's role!
Â 
im extremely confused thinking of the possibly significance of having Yara meet/fight Ramsay...
Â 
only thing that makes sense is they planning on cutting Mance and his women going to winterfell, instead decided to use Yara's attack on Dreadfort to allow Theon to escape...but that would be jumping quite a bit ahead no?Â 
Â 
in the show, did they mention what happened on her conquest to capture Deepwood Motte? no one hold Moat Cailin right?Â
2340	Beric175	2014-05-07	This actually can only end with a big change from the books: either Ramsay dies, which will change the course of the story but it's unlikely, given that we only met him last season,
Â 
or yara dies, in which case her whole ADWD material gets drowned in water but doesn't rise again,
Â 
or noone dies and she gets captured,
Â 
or noone dies andÂ Yara escapes, with Reek getting some more punishment. This might present a change from the book in that when she gets to the Kingsmoot next season her motivation for becoming Quen of the Iron islands could be so she can have all the ironborn behind her to free her brother maybe?

Look I think when people started mentioning her as a possible fake Arya it's been misconstrued by a lot of members on here.
If they are going use her as fake Arya it will be the story device not that actual character.
Â 
She will be Yara, heir/queen of the Iron Islands marrying Ramsay for the Bolton's claim on the Isles and as a control of Iron Born forces in the North.
PuttingÂ  her as Ayra when she is probably older than Robb would be completely ridiculous.

I imagine it would be the same point of having Robb plan a big attack on Casterly Rock to make the unsullied think he's going to rally and kick some Lannister ass, but instead he just gets brutally murdered.
I love Asha, I really do; but, objectively, besides the Kingsmoot (which I'm not at all certain will even be in the show), what does she actually do in the books, plot-wise, beyond this point? She licks her wounds at Deepwood Motte and gets captured by Stannis. That's pretty much it. So, yeah, I'm concerned for her life on the show.

2351	jentario	2014-05-08	My guess:
-Yara attacks the Dreadfort, Ramsay fights her and she ends up falling back.
-Ramsay takes out his anger on poor little Reek.
-Yara falls back to the center of Ironborn control in the North- Moat Cailin. She warns everyone that Ramsay is coming for them, and they inform her that her father died- was flung from a bridge at Pyke.
-Yara decides that she must leave for Pyke and face the newly arrived Euron (on a ship in the western coast- which means she doesn't have to go around Westeros again), leaving her men behind at Moat Cailin and letting Kenning lead them.
-Ramsay and Theon arrive at Moat Cailin, and after a battle Ramsay sends Reek with a white flag to "barter" with the Ironborn- and he is ready to betray his sister who came to save him, thinking she is there
-Reek finds out his sister is safe, and betrays the Ironborn at Moat Cailin, they get slaughtered by Ramsay
-Ramsay and Reek return to the Dreadfort and Roose informs them that now that the Ironborn aren't a threat and they can reunite with their army, tyhey'll be moving on to Winterfell (with a possible mention of fake Arya).

This would obviously spread over episodes 6, 8, 10 and maybe 7 (I'm not sure) with the big Moat Cailin confrontation happening in episode 8.
2352	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-08	My guess:
-Yara attacks the Dreadfort, Ramsay fights her and she ends up falling back.
-Ramsay takes out his anger on poor little Reek.
-Yara falls back to the center of Ironborn control in the North- Moat Cailin. She warns everyone that Ramsay is coming for them, and they inform her that her father died- was flung from a bridge at Pyke.
-Yara decides that she must leave for Pyke and face the newly arrived Euron (on a ship in the western coast- which means she doesn't have to go around Westeros again), leaving her men behind at Moat Cailin and letting Kenning lead them.
-Ramsay and Theon arrive at Moat Cailin, and after a battle Ramsay sends Reek with a white flag to "barter" with the Ironborn- and he is ready to betray his sister who came to save him, thinking she is there
-Reek finds out his sister is safe, and betrays the Ironborn at Moat Cailin, they get slaughtered by Ramsay
-Ramsay and Reek return to the Dreadfort and Roose informs them that now that the Ironborn aren't a threat and they can reunite with their army, tyhey'll be moving on to Winterfell (with a possible mention of fake Arya).
Â 
This would obviously spread over episodes 6, 8, 10 and maybe 7 (I'm not sure) with the big Moat Cailin confrontation happening in episode 8.


Â 
Â 
I hope Ramsay mutilates him a bit more...at least enough to get his hair to go white!
Â 
i like your ideas, im not sure if they will really be able to get that much done this season, there's still a lot of KL, Wall, meereen and Brienne's story line that they already plan on showing this season...
Â 
would be nice if they started focusing more on these characters to prepare the audience for not seeing much of meereen or bran as their story lines will be moving the slowest
2353	I'll pay the iron price	2014-05-08	I hope they dont decide to kill her off!
2354	Onna Lewyys	2014-05-08	Why do people keep thinking that Asha/Yara will be killed in this episode or in the show? She is an important and vital character for the Ironborn arc and the friction there, not to mention the Kingsmoot ritual.

Personally, it's because I'm not convinced that the Ironborn arc is even going to be in the show. Unlike the Dornish arc (which has now been set up through Oberyn's significant presence, plus references to Doran, Myrcella, the Sand Snakes, and Dornish history v. Targaryens), there have been zero references to any of Asha & Theon's uncles or anything happening with the Ironborn outside of how they affect Theon's storyline.
Add to that the fact that Meereen on the show has a navy with enough ships to take Dany's army to Westeros whenever she decides she wants to go, and it seems to make Victarion's fleet unnecessary in the future.
I sincerely hope I'm wrong, but I'm not counting on it.

Well, it seems like Moat Cailin is in as well as the assault on the Dreadfort, the rest is just filling in what will probably bridge the two events. The thing I'm not so sure of is where Yara goes: does she really leave for Pyke from Moat Cailin? Does she die there (god let's hope not)? Does she go to Deepwood Motte instead (which is essentially goodbye to the whole Â Kingsmoot storyline, since I doubt they'll do it without her)? I still think and hope that including Dorne and the Iron Islands in season 5 is doable and worth the trouble, so I really to see her get back to Pyke. Fingers crossed.

Â 


Â 
I remember it being similar in the books as well...there was no sign of anything related to Pyke for a very very long time (wasn't it the whole of book 3?) and then all of a sudden you see Aeron's POV.
Â 
cutting them out would be a sure way of losing all the Greyjoy fans...no matter what you say of D&D, they would not do something to lose that big portion of audience...

Â 
with you on this!Â
2357	KnightOfTheCouch	2014-05-08	I have a sneaking suspicion that Yara gets captured too. I have no logical reasoning for it, just sort of popped into my head. If that happens, I can see them going the same Theon/Reek route (torture) with her. Maybe Ramsay disfigures her so much that he names her 'Freak'? Any thoughts?
2358	Arkash	2014-05-08	Personally, it's because I'm not convinced that the Ironborn arc is even going to be in the show.

Â 

Â 
Now is the perfect opportunity to start throwing on the Iron Born references.
Â 
Yara will need someone to talk (be it Ralf Kenning or Tristifer Botley), she'll have an interlocutor, and I bet she's gonna reference her uncles.

I don't think anybody at all is expecting it to be in this season...
2361	Harry Lime	2014-05-08	My best guess:
Â 
Ep. 6 - Yara and the Ironborn attack Dreadfort. Yara puts up a hell of a fight, but her men are killed and she is captured. Ramsay announces that he's bringing her along with him to Moat Cailin as extra leverage against the Ironborn stationed there. (No Yara becoming FakeArya, for the love of God)
Â 
Ep. 8 - Either before, during, or after Theon's negotiation with the Ironborn, Yara does something clever and escapes.
Â 
Ep. 10 - Yara, now without troops and aware that Theon doesn't want to be rescued, decides to return to Pyke. So she finds a decent boat, pays the iron price, and sets sail for home.

2362	LilJonUmber	2014-05-08	I imagine it would be the same point of having Robb plan a big attack on Casterly Rock to make the unsullied think he's going to rally and kick some Lannister ass, but instead he just gets brutally murdered.
I love Asha, I really do; but, objectively, besides the Kingsmoot (which I'm not at all certain will even be in the show), what does she actually do in the books, plot-wise, beyond this point? She licks her wounds at Deepwood Motte and gets captured by Stannis. That's pretty much it. So, yeah, I'm concerned for her life on the show.


Yeah, I really wouldn't be surprised it she's offed, coupled with the demise of Balon, Reek -- and the audience -- would think the Greyjoy line/story is dunzo.
Â 
Until...

Â 
They need the Ironborn arc in season 5, otherwise it's going to be a pretty tame season.
2364	I'll pay the iron price	2014-05-09	I dont get why people think Theon would not want to be rescued by his Sister?
He's messed up mentally but not THAT messed up!
He has nothing to live for......................yet.
BUT his sister turning up promising to take him home will re-ignite his will to live.
Â 
If Yara is captured, no-way will Ramsay torture her - Roose wouldnt let him.
She would be the perfect "whole" Greyjoy that Roose craved.

Â 
He's not Theon, though. He's Reek.
Â 
I mean, yeah, if they had a chance to have a one-on-one heart to heart, there's a possibility Yara could snap him out of it, but I don't think Ramsay is going to give her that chance.

2366	Hath4	2014-05-09	I do not see him betraying ramsay. if he did why would he send him in to moat Cailin two episodes later. I think reek will remain loyal.
2367	I'll pay the iron price	2014-05-09	Yes but Reek shivered when Tansy was ripped apart from the Hounds.
Theres still enough of Theon left for him to care about being rescued.
He's obeying Ramsay because he knows what will happen if he doesnt.
Â 
Then Yara turns up.
What would you do?
Opt to remain with the Psycho who tortured/mutliated you or jump into your big sisters arms?

Â 
I dont see him betraying Ramsay either but unless the epsiode 6 preview is very cleverly edited it shows Theon with Yara and her men.
I think more likely Yara will be overwhelmed and captured herself OR forced to retreat without Theon
2370	Hath4	2014-05-09	Ramsays number one goal will be to reclaim his reek. To him reek is his greatest accomplishment. so we shall see how this all plays out.
2371	TommenFoolery	2014-05-09	Honestly, even if it's just "filler" as some of you say, it is a really good and entertaining one, give me that over more randomly sassy talk in KL, Dany "badass" one-liners, or if we go by the books, Tyrion watching turtles and Brienne's adventures with Nimble Dick...


Â 
I'm all for filler so long as it isn't book spoilers.
2372	alienarea	2014-05-09	If Yar(Ash)a were captured, would Ramsay tie her to the cross bare-chested as well?

2378	Koi No Yokan	2014-05-10	Well, if anyone's crazy enough to fight without armour on, it's Ramsay.

And I refuse to believe Asha will be tortured.

Its not the armour I have a problem with, if you are attacked out of nowhere you have no option but to fight. I just don't like the way he seems to be the first guy charging into them, which is incredibly stupid.
2382	Hath4	2014-05-10	Yeah but that's ramsay he is fearless, which roose points out in the books. it's crazy but he is really crazy. semms pretty in line with his character.

I don't think his decision is what is incredible there, but the fact that he survives (as we know he does.) It'll make the Ironborn look inept and helpless if they can't kill him
2386	Tyrion1991	2014-05-10	I think Asha will get captured along with Theon by the Boltons. They will then escape together. She is basically replacing fake Arya.
Â 
If the show really wants to deviate from the books they could have Ramsey actually marry Yara to try to gain control of the Iron Islands but its more likely that this time Ramsey will accept her as a hostage since his father was super pissed at him for mutilating Theon.
2387	Beric175	2014-05-10	Lets pray Ramsay does not goÂ torturous andÂ murderous sex maniac on the women in the episode....although since it's in character for him I'm not sure it would cause as much of aÂ controversy at this point.

2390	ballajam	2014-05-10	I feel like it will be something similar to the Bran/Jon interaction last episode. The show creators need to include the actress and actors in the series in some way or another and they will make them meet up and have a battle where Asha(yara) will get defeated and retreat back to the iron islands to find out everything about her uncles.Â 
Â 
Something like that where it doesnt deviate too much from the book plot line by adding unnecessary meeting between the two to go way out of context Â but adds action and drama to the show line.Â
2391	Bastard of the Dreadfort	2014-05-10	I hope Ramsay does kill Myranda while in bed. It will only serve to further enhance his evil character on the show. He'll love you one moment, then kill you the next, just for the hell of it.

I also hope he kills Myranda or she dies in this episode but I remember when they were filming season 4 the actress that plays her tweeted she is taking horseback riding lessons for the show. So why would she need the lessons if she hasn't gotten to ride a horse yet. hmm..Â

2397	Hath4	2014-05-10	it could easily be for another role sense she has been in other peroid peices that would invlove horses such as the muskiters. she never said it was for game of thrones.
2398	Maia	2014-05-10	I have a crackpot notion that Yara may replace Alys Karstark, somewhat. She will escape Dreadfort, and flee in direction of the Wall, pursued by the Bolton men.

How in the world is a topless Ramsey with little to now experience in deadly combat going to charge in and come out alive.That's the question I was asking, even if she left 10 guys to guard the boat (boats?)... Ramsay didn't seem to have but about 10 or so guys with him, the book Asha and her best fighter could have wiped the floor with them.
2401	Widows_Blood	2014-05-10	What i'm thinking is maybe Ramsay captures Yara. Roose sends a raven to Pyke informing Balon that he has her and will release her into his custody once the ironborn give up Moat Calin. Balon agrees to the terms. Ramsay has Theon go to Moat Calin to give the ironborn there the news and Yara is released and goes back to Pyke.Â
2402	Hath4	2014-05-10	That would ruin the entire moat cailin sequence. if yara is captured she will remain with the boltons until next year. Trading yara for moat Cailin would really make reeks trip there meaningless. Plus while balon loves yara, he loves power more, he would never give up the key to the north.

You are raising a very interesting point here : I wonder if the whole point of Yara's arc this season is to make the viewer enjoy her and root for her to create emotional investment to the Kingsmoot. Even if some would call this arc pointless if she returns for Kingsmoot, it would show her under a great light and prepare us for a great Kingsmoot on TV.


Good call. There has been no filler, the time scale for the show won't allow it, the show only subplot was there for a reason, as is Yara's, maybe the above reason is it?
2404	Hath4	2014-05-10	Well crasters easily falls under filler.

Could be for GoT, could be for a cut scene, it happens.
Â 
Next episode might also provide an introduction for the mudmen. If any action takes place at Moat Cailin. Another lil spoiler for those who like getting their knickers in a twist.
2406	Asshai by the Shadow	2014-05-10	Well crasters easily falls under filler.


Actually Crasters was used to show the non-readers another reason why it makes sense Jon will be elected as LC by the NW men, since he led the attack on Crasters and showed his leadership etc..Â
2407	go joff go	2014-05-10	Am i the only one who think ramsey is going to "release" ramsey to yara otherwise what is that scene where ramsey comes in to see theon with the blood on his chest. It has to be after whatever happens with Miranda, but before the scene where yara has theon.
2408	Onna Lewyys	2014-05-10	Why couldn't it be after the Ironborn are defeated and Theon is recaptured?
2409	Arry Lannister	2014-05-10	I see no logical reason why they would have Yara come all the way to the Dreadfort only to immediately go to Moat Caitlin and then immediately go back to Pyke.Â 
Â 

They just want the unsullied to have a familiar face to root for in the kingsmoot. Most unsullied I know don't give a shit about the Greyjoys, so having Asha/Yara do something heroic will make the unsullied remember her.Â 
Â 
As for my predictions, I bet that Ramsay will be in a critical position where Yara could take him out but suddenly Theon gets in the way and protects Ramsay. Yara will be shocked and then she will escape with the surviving iron-born because Theon is lost.
2410	Hath4	2014-05-10	in the promo you can see yara question one of ramsays men about theon, he probably tells her he is in the kennels. so that is probably how she finds him. As for the scene with reek scurrying back to the wall that is most likely yara and her ironborn entering the kennels. Ramsay comes in later after yara has released reek. at least something like that. 
					
					
							Edited by Hath4, 10 May 2014 - 07:59 PM.
2411	The brown snake	2014-05-10	Its oblivious she finds him, but do they get out? Remember she only has 50 men (while they are the best in the Iron Islands) Ramsay probably has a lot more, maybe Theon will pledge his loyalty to Ramsay in return to let his Sister go (remember the hunt in the second episode) But maybe Yarra does rescue him, as there was a promo pic of Theon in a Greyjoy armour, but I was under the assumption of this was when he went to get the Moat for Ramsay.
Anyway I think eventually both Greyjoys are either going to be
A) separated ... again.
B )Captured by either the Boltons (and we all know what happens when people get captured by the Boltons) or by Stannis (but not until another episode as he is currently in Bravvos)
C) Yarra goes to he Iron islands to attend the Kingsmoote (or what ever its called) and leaves Theon in the iron born run northern stronghold as her Uncles may probably try to kill him. Even without his *cough* genitles he does have a better claim than Euron... even through the iron born make there own Laws. And while Yarra/ Asha is gone Theon ends up with Ramsay... again.
Â I don't think they will die as both siblings I think have an important part in WOW but I don't have much hope for a Happy Greyjoy ending.

Â 
As long as there's a reason (ie, sudden attack while he's boning Myranda), Iwan Rheon can keep his shirt off as long as he wants. Gaaaah he's pretty. Especially with the blood splashes.Â

Can't wait for the next chapter of Zero Dark Greyjoy.Â

2413	The Dragon has three heads	2014-05-11	I see no logical reason why they would have Yara come all the way to the Dreadfort only to immediately go to Moat Caitlin and then immediately go back to Pyke.Â  If they wanted her to be in Pyke, they would have left her there and not sent her on a mission where she accomplishes nothing. If they wanted her to be in Moat Cailin, they would have sent her to Moat Cailin (to substitute for Deepwood Motte). I'm not sure how she even "retreats" from the Dreadfort without getting on the boat she came there on and if she does that, she isn't going to end up anywhere close to a central location like Moat Cailin. Unless perhaps she's going to jog there?
Â 
I know fans really, really want her to be back in Pyke for the Kingsmoot and are twisting themselves in knots trying to work backwards from that notion but dramatically, the minute they sent her on this mission, it signaled that they wanted to majorly alter her storyline.

Yep. This.

2415	Beric175	2014-05-11	well, the Bran stuff led to Bran avenging Jaime because Locke was the man who maimed jaime, the man who tossed Bran out the window andÂ isÂ responsible for Bran being in this situation in the first place. It's Branception.

It's Branception.What is interesting is Roose now is clueless about Bran ... and probably thinks Theon is so traumatized he is just telling Ramsay nonsense.At least Roose gets zero info on Bran.It's not in the books that I remember , that is Roose didn't have a thought in world about Bran and Rickon, tho, it I would have thought he would have. So the show has introduced something the books seemed should of had.(Come to think on it I can't remember if Ramasy tells him about the two Stark boys?)Still if Roose had of known that Bran was north of Wall it would be insane to send someone after him.Takes us readers a long long time to find out about Rickon , and that's still not really clear.

2417	Hath4	2014-05-11	In the books ramsay told roose about them being alive, ramsay and his goons tried to hunt them down, but failed.
2418	Red Onion Knight	2014-05-11	Apologies if this has already been suggested but what if:
Â 
- Yara attempts to free Theon
- Ramsay stops her, kills her men and captures her
- Ramsay performs one of his "hunts" as he's want to do but Yara actually does the rare thing of escaping (it is mentioned in the books that some of the women Ramsay hunts do escape from time to time)
Â 
Personally I think this would be cool, we've already seen one hunt end horribly so it would be great to see Yara use her intelligence and fighting skills to evade Ramsay and hopefully find passage back to Pyke. It would also deepen the rivalry between Ramsay and Yara as they each try to kidnap/keep Theon.
2419	Colonel Green	2014-05-11	We've been getting a number of mentions of things relating to Dorne this season.Â  There's been no real mentions of the Iron Islands comparable to that, but Theon and co. have been in only one episode to date.Â  When Yara and her crew join the fray here, it'll be interesting to see if we get any allusions comparable to those relating to Dorne.
Â 
This particular story is interesting, really, as it's pretty much the sole element of the final five episodes that has a lot of big question marks attached to it.

2423	pwnt	2014-05-11	It will end up as I predicted a couple of weeks ago.Â  The entire Ironborn storyline that is in the books, ends with Yara's flaying at the hands of Ramsay (in front of Reek/Theon, in fact, they may even have Reek take part in the flaying).Â  With all the storylines already, there's no way they are going to bring in that whole Ironborn mess from the books into the TV series.Â  In the books, Ramsay rapes some chick in front of Theon and flays a bunch of Ironborn.Â  I think he'll rape Yara, torture and flay her and the rest of the ironborn and that will be that as far as that storyline is concerned.

2426	boojam	2014-05-11	It is one of the things I am definitely watching out for tonight. Do we get a greyjoy brother reference.I am guessing Yara/Asha get's away....Then is Theon the only Greyjoy we see the rest of the season...I am gonna guess we see the demise of Balon this season... maybe one more episode with Gemma Whelan.Why I am guessing, short of meaty material next season, lots of Greyjoy stuff, I hope, an injection of the crazies would be good!
2427	Hard Hugh	2014-05-11	Â 
Â 
I wonder how on-screen Balon's death could happen in all of this. Maybe intro of episode 8, something visual and silent (the storm, the bridge, the silhouette, could be a great intro to the episode).Â 


Â 
One way could be the much speculated push off the bridge by a faceless man we last saw with Arya.
2428	Yojimbo	2014-05-11	I don't see the Greyjoys story getting cut all together. Just the Kingsmoot and Vic. They may just merge Vic and Crows Eye character. Because from what we know already Dany would not need Vics ships as presented in the books. Crow Eye could just sit his ass on the Seastone chair and go unopposed in the show. Then we would still get to see the Shields getting taken,Â  and the horn may or may not be put in another way.
2429	Colonel Green	2014-05-11	Well, that may be the single most pointless story diversion to date.
2430	Hath4	2014-05-11	Agree but hey it clear we are getting the iron-born storyline in some form.

2433	Cas Stark	2014-05-11	Well, that was extremely silly.
Â 
LMAO. Â So, crazy Ramsay just let's them go, alrighty then. Â And we don't even get to see the dogs chase and kill anyone? Â WTF.
Â 
Yeah, butterfly effect in full force. And so, when she meets her brother again, it will be totally anti climatic, because he's already dead to her. Â And the point of all these changes was what, again? Â This is needed for TV why again? Â
2434	Darth Pipes	2014-05-11	Things were going quite well until Ramsay pulled a Mister Burns and released the hounds.Â  It turned out to be a Craster's Keep-type diversion but hey, it was more interesting than a lot of the Ironborn stuff.
Â 
Yara's speech was excellent though even if it later turned into a "Well, good-bye, folks!Â  Let me know how this all turns out!"
2435	NightStark	2014-05-11	Â This is needed for TV why again? Â 


Â 
To show that Theon is completely subservient to Ramsay and won't attempt to escape even when there's a legitimate chance and the rescuer is his own sister.
Â
2436	Benjaario Starkharis	2014-05-11	I think the scene served a purpose, to show that Theon Reek is completely brainwashed, and a throwback to Ramsay's ruse back in season 3 where he pretended to save Theon. Better than Craster's Keep, at least, and much shorter. Oh, and with Yara alive and retreating, the Kingsmoot is totally happening next season. I bet episode 10 will have a scene with Balon dying after he sees a huge fleet approaching Pyke.

Â 
No, in that scene you got Theon make a conscious decison to avoid being flayed alive. There was no way out for him there.
Â 
If he had slit Ramsay's throat, Locke would have taken his arm off and Roose would have flayed him alive. Nobody would expect him to strike a blow for freedom in that scene.
Â 
Rejecting his own sister and a legitimate chance of escape is, however, a shocker. To the non readers at least.

I thought the whole segment was stupid from top to bottom. Â The IB get in, they get to Theon and then, they simply are allowed to run away by Ramsay fucking Bolton? Â You've got to be kidding me. Â Not only would the IB not run away like that but Ramsay would never in a thousand years let Asha Greyjoy leave when he could have taken her captive.

There's really not, there's no POV here remember. The only way they could impress upon the non readers just how far Theon is gone atm, is to have him reject him own family and freedom because he fears Ramsay so much.
Â 
From what I've seen of non reader forums that storyline achieved the aim of showing Theon's decline.

This I agree with. But I think Ramsay moves to the beat of his own drum. Roose already chided him for flaying Theon, what would he do if he did the same to asha?
2453	Khal-a-bunga	2014-05-11	People confuse me... Does anyone actually think that Yara and her men left only because of a couple of dogs? Apparently, which is just silly. Even more confusing is that people seem to think Ramsay let her leave. The totality of the scenario is what caused Yara to flee (Theon refusing to come with her; the fact that her and her men had been discovered; the fact that, if they would have stuck around, things most definitely would not have ended well for her), obviously.Â 
Â 
As for where this is going: I'll withhold judgement until we see where it goes. I'm just happy that this seems to indicate that we'll be seeing Euron & Victarion next season. I'm not entirely convinced that Yara is heading back to the Iron Islands, for the time being, though.

1. Everybody already knew that we were going to see Victarion and Euron next season. They're too vital to the story to leave out.Â 
2. Nothing about this episode confirmed their inclusion.
3. Ramsay threatened her with the key that unlocked the dog pins, and in the next scene Yara was running like a little bitch.Â 
Â 
Regardless of any amount of extrapolation or head-explanation, there wasn't a single thing about this scene that made since. Starting with the most important aspect of: Why the fuck is Ramsay still at the Dreadfort? Did he not just get orders to take back Moat Cailin like 3 episodes ago?
2455	Belisarius09	2014-05-11	This scene was bad.Â  It was nice to finally see Asha again, but they should have just stuck to the plot in the book.Â  These pointless subplots do nothing to advance the story, and whats more, they're poorly done hogwash.Â

Â 
It isn't going anywhere. Â It's over.
Â 
Ramsay threatened to let the dogs out and the Iron Born split. Â Since we didn't see the dogs let out and any narrow escape, this is the implication of the scene.
Â 
I'm not sure what Asha going to the Dreadfort to save Theon and then deciding to save herself instead has to do with the kingsmoot or how many greyjoy brothers we see in the future.
2458	of man and wolf	2014-05-11	All I know though is that the "50 best killers on the Iron Islands" were handled pretty easily. Ramsay even went in shirtless.

Theons stuff is a nightmare adapt I think they are showing his descent really well.  I just wish  instead of threatening with the dogs, ramsey just says he will let her go, make something up for why, but the dogs without having some kind of real chase scene just ended up being choppy. Or instead of ramsey having that monologue yara should have cut her losses and fled.

When was that explained? I was under the impression that when Roose Bolton gives you an order, you follow it immediately. He told Locke to find the Stark boys and an episode later he was at the Wall. 
At no point did Roose say, "Locke, you do this thing immediately, and Ramsay, well...do this whenever you feel like it."
2463	of man and wolf	2014-05-11	My other question is the cuts all over Ramsays body....does he enjoy self-harming himself? Were they from this battle? Does he cut himself like he does to Reek apparently?
Â 
I thought that blood was gonna be Myranda's at the start.
2464	ejhawman	2014-05-11	So, the writers/producers dropped the ball hard on this one? Hardly surprising, alas.
Â 
Just caught the YouTube upload of the scene where Theon refused to go, thought he was Reek. Too soon. He hasn't been cooking under Ramsey's torture for enough months.
2465	Khal-a-bunga	2014-05-11	Well, considering there weren't fifty men in the kennels with Yara, we'd have to assume that some of the men stayed with the ship, and others were awaiting Theon and the rest of the Iron Born to assist with their escape.Â 
Â 
And you'd have to be pretty dense to think that Ramsay releasing the hounds was the only reason she fled with her men. There's no logic to that line of thinking at all, given the precarious situation they were already in. Use your brain; deduce that she hadÂ plentyÂ of reasons to high-tail it the fuck out of there, and the dogs were just one of them. Or should she have clearly explained why they fled, so that the simpletons in the audience could understand? Except, I'd have to imagine that even the simpletons clearly understand her reasoning, because it's blatantly obvious - stay, fight, and die or flee.Â

Ha, good point.
Â 
But this show does that sort of thing all the time. Took Jamie a while to get back to Kings Landng, others are back from Winterfell by the next episode. Arya and the Hound travel forever, as does Bran and co, but Locke and certain others move real quick.
Â 
I dont think the timelines necessarily follow the episodes accordingly.

Really? Because that's something that clearly isn't true in either the books or the show. So no exception needed. I'd also argue that fleeing and surrendering are obviously not the same thing. Live to fight another day, and what not.Â

Let's introduce a seven minute rescue where the rescue doesn't happen and the villain lets the other heir of the Iron Isles just run away?
Â 
It was too fast, dumb, shirtless fighting against armored shielded men, and just bad, bad bad bad bad awful shitty writing. This show blows.
Â

2476	juanml82	2014-05-11	The dogs are dangerous. The Ironborn are armored and have swords to deal with them, just like they've dealt with the dangerous garrison. As it is, I feel it doesn't make sense. If the threat was to release the dogs to kill Theon, who was behind Ramsay and his men, and the Ironborn are seen fighting their way out, then it would make sense. But, as it is, it's completely anticlimatic.
2477	DaveyJoe	2014-05-11	It was the dumbest scene ever filmed. Not for the show (which has been categorically awful), but the dumbest scene ever filmed EVER. Let's introduce a seven minute rescue where the rescue doesn't happen and the villain lets the other heir of the Iron Isles just run away?
Â 
It was too fast, dumb, shirtless fighting against armored shielded men, and just bad, bad bad bad bad awful shitty writing. This show blows.

True, but the dothraki usually fight on horseback. It is an advantage. The Dothraki would most likely lose as well to armoured soldiers.

2486	King Blackbeard	2014-05-11	Asha attacking the Dreadfort was something I was looking forward to this season.Â  But I honestly can come up with nothing positive to say about this scene, I guess Asha's actress had some screen time in her contract this season so they tried to whip something together, but it just fell flat.
Â 
In such a closed space, Ramsey fighting unarmored was a horrible decision, there is no way in hell he didn't get hit by either Ironborn or one of his own men, Dothraki fight topless but they do so out in the open, and even then, they'd get smashed in Westeros.

Were they wearing full-on armor? Â I didn't pay attention to what it was made of.

2493	The Abominable SnowOther	2014-05-11	What's up with all the hate?
Â 
Yah, the scene was a little out there, but it was cool. IB raiding the DD, a rescue attempt, some fight scenes. You need a counterbalance to the only two other scenes, council meetings and trial.
2494	Fredwin	2014-05-11	Character building? Did you mean character assassination?
Â 
Think about how this scene ended. Yara threatens Ramsay as if she has the upper-hand. Ramsay holds up a key and asks her how fast she can run. Just by saying that all of a sudden changes the balance of power back to Ramsay? Really!? ONE DOG? Those dogs were in individual cages. How many cages did Yara believe he was going to be able to open before she physically attacked him? It's just beyond ridiculous, it's daytime soap-opera level.Â 
Â 
This just makes Yara look cowardly, idiotic and inept. She allows the threat of a keyÂ to force a retreat. She does not even attempt to throw an axe or knife at Ramsay or anything. That whole speech about how tough Ironborn are and how insulted they should be by Theon's capture and she doesn't even seek revenge against the lord 10 feet astride of her?
Â 
Speaking of the speech, which I really liked. At least I think I liked, considering it was drowned out by a woman's sexual gratification. What a terrible time for sexposition. The way they edited the scene wouldn't have been bad if Ramsay's side of the cuts were silent.
Â 
Finally, SPEAKING of cuts. How the hell was this scene resolved? They literally JUMP-CUT to them leaving on the boats. This is not a scene that can be resolved with a JUMP-CUT.Â 
Â 
Very amateur work overall, and this coming from a fan of the show. At least Tyrion's trial was equally good as this scene was bad.

Â 
Not believable...but neither do I believe in dragons or fire gods, and Ramsay is the prettiest little psycho north of Dorne.Â 
Â 
The "run away!" transition was goofy though...just a few more seconds, to clarify motivations. Sure it was probably more Yara giving up on Theon and not wanting to lose the men who'd unquestioningly followed her, but the visual/narrative handling was silly. Also, this was just me, but the blood on Ramsay's chest looked like splatters more than cuts. I took it to mean they'd fought other Ironborn en route to the kennels.Â 
Â 
It did give a great lead-up to the bath scene though, which was awesomely creeptastic in every way.Â

Maybe the point after the slap was where Ramsay gets all the blood. Because otherwise it looks like he got it from implied fighting, or he just likes to self harm himself.
2497	King Belushi	2014-05-11	That was some anticlimatic filler waste of precious time bullshit if I ever saw one.
The Ironborn were like "Oh shit, dogs! Our only weakness!"Â and then went all Monty Python and the Holy Grail against rabbits toward shore.
Sure, Alfie Allen's acting was incredible, but the whole Dreadfort attack in the episode was rushed and misplaced, like a lot of show-only arcs.
You know when a scene is bad when it can damage a show backwards, for it has taken away all tension created by the last time we saw the Greyjoys, when we could just as easily had spent that time dealing with Balon's ultimate fate.

Â 
All armour does is protect you "if" you get hit. As long as you don't and are good enough fighter, then it's fine. Plenty of characters in the book and show have fought without armour because they were good enough or had confidence to do so. In fact, most people in the armies in medieval times fought without armour because they couldon't afford to by them. I don't know, I don't think it's as far fetch as people think. Luck and skill was on Ramsay's side.
Â 
I do agree though that the scene could've been handled better. Maybe have one of Yara's men say something about other Dreadfort men will be coming or something like that.

We all enjoy it on some level. Let me ask you a different question. Do you think the scene could have been shot better? If so, how much better?Â

Letting the producers and showrunner's know that we knowÂ the answer to that will hopefully lead to a better product. One hopefully defunct of laziness.

Â 
Am not going to say dogs (especially a war dog as the show has depected them) is not a dangerous and intimidating animal. But are you really suggesting a 200+ pound man, in armour with a sword/axe/dagger/weapon is not an even more dangerous and intimidating prospect to fight? And if a person is to run away from dogs, wouldn't they have bolted it when they see a group of battle trained men in the first place?

Well said.
Â 
No, dogs aren't more dangerous than armed soldiers. Â But they're a different kind of dangerous, and they're one that I'm pretty confident Yara hasn't spent her life sparring against. Â Add to that that she lost a chunk of her men, the rest of the Dreadfort was on its way, and she was just bitten by Theon... Â Good choice, girl.
Â 
I was only bringing up the dogs in the first place because in multiple places, not just this thread, I've seen people finding it comical that she ran from the dogs. Â It's not comical. Â It's justified. Â

2511	shiola	2014-05-12	I also just want to add that, given that D&D have said they don't have problems killing off characters at different times than the books, I had some fear that Yara actually could have died in this scene. Â The adrenaline and anxiety from that made the scene more intense to watch.
2512	Envie	2014-05-12	I normally defend the directors / writers in their choices for the story lines that deviate from the books - almost without fail I've found redeeming qualities and aspects of the scenes they fabricate. This is the FIRST one in 4 seasons I found very little I could defend and a whole lot more I found unbelievable and even confusing.Â 
Â 
When Ramsay held up the key - and they fled... I had a WTF moment. I didn't get it. As someone else said - the dogs were penned up individually so how the hell... were they all just going to stand there waiting patiently while he unlocked each cage? One dog wasn't going to do much harm against all those armored / shielded / armed men with Yara Â ... or was the dog going to attack Theon instead? I Â ... just, did. not. get it.Â 
Â 
Yeah I DO get it that it wasn't just the dogs that made Yara and crew run. Apparently the sight of crazy-eyed Ramsay's sexy bloodied up bare chest was enough to do that. /eyeroll.Â 
Â 
And I don't believe for one minute, in those close quarters with that many guys fighting that Ramsay didn't get injured...armor or not. Bogus.
Â 
All the rest of it was fine... but this is the first time I'm jumping on the thumbs down wagon for the kennel scene.
2513	HouseHarrison	2014-05-12	It was as dumb as you could expect a filler involving Theon, Asha, and Ramsay could be.
Â 
D&D dropped the ball on Ironmen culture on top of it. "Go fight for your king!". Really Asha, if you were book Asha you'd know that's not how you get Ironmen to do anything.

I think it would've been more effective if it were more dogs. It was like two...still scary for the average person, but visually a pack would've upped the ante.Â

Not that I'm mad or anything, or that I had expectations. I guess it's just one way to introduce us to more Ironborn storylines in the next season, by making them seem inept and irrelevant and full of entirely unwarranted pride.

Â 

Really, i hope most of the people complaining are actually fans of the Ironborn. Because the amount of hate for those characters i usually see doesn't add up to the (collective) character "assassination" claims.
Â 
Analyzing every scene detail by minute detail will show some flaws, of course. But really, what's so far fetched about Asha & his men running? Do we need a chalkboard?
Â 
The shirtless Ramsey would be a legitimate concern, but even then, Roose described him in the books as reckless and savage when he fights. So it's not out of character, though a bit "tryhard badass".
Â 
Or Asha claiming her crew were the "50 best IB killers". Why the hell would Balon let her take the 1% best of his subjects anyway? They would have to be with him or Victarion.
Â 
And yes, i think the rescue mission ending so fast is clearly setting up the introduction of the uncles. Probably by name & situation in the remainder of S04, & for real in S05. And we might have the Kingsmoot after so much speculation (fingers crossed).

Â 



This. Does she spend time trying to kill Ramsay, the men next to him, the dogs whilst the rest of the Dreadfort descends upon her? (Please tell me you heard the alarm bells.) Or does she flee? I'd pick flee.
Â 
IMO, the best killers are the ones who stay alive. So yes, they fled rather than chance it. It's not cowardice to refrain from lingering in a castle with an unknown greater amount of enemies where you don't know the layout and have never been but your enemies do.

2519	Pallantides	2014-05-12	Ramsay had his guard down to Asha for at least 32 seconds, and at least 12 seconds where he's fumbling at the lock and has his back towards her. She could have put her axe into his back right then and there. She could have thrown it, and smoked him in the head, and even if the blade didn't hit, it would've been enough heft to at least maim him and potentially knock him out considering he had no helmet or any other sort of head protection.

2522	Fjordgazer	2014-05-12	Also, do any one of you realize that Asha's amazing finger-dancing skills have NOT been laid out in the show? So, you're complaining that shirtless Ramsay just obeys to a "badassery quota" for the Unsullied, and instead some of you propose that they should show Asha try her luck finishing Ramsay there and then with a flying axe (badassery quota ad infinitum), when it's not been established that she could actually pull that stunt off.
Â 
Seriously, i'd love a page-by-page TV adaptation, but the book-purism movement need to take a breath and at least not contradict themselves.

Breaking Bad was the TV series with the most respect to detail ever, a claim not made by me but by a multitude of other people. Yet some people would still be complaining if the time to unscrew the containers of methylamine and screw them again in the famous train heist scene (S05E05) didn't seem realistic enough for them, for whatever whimsical minute reason. The whole scene was a masterpiece with a consistency and realism that 99% of released movies only dream of.

2527	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-05-12	It wouldn't call it "course correction".Â  When they sent Yara they would have had some idea of what she would be doing.Â  That turned out to be "not much at all".


Â 
Well, I guess it's course correction in the sense that at least now that side mission is over (I assume) all those characters are more or less where they're supposed to be and there really was no damage done (other than the fact that the "sister, this time I knew you" moment is a kind of screwed now, but I guess it would have been hard to pull off anyway)
2528	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-12	The writers painted themselves into a corner last season when they decided (for whatever reason) to have Yara rescue Theon. This episode was just Cogman trying to walk away from that mess without screwing those storylines in a major way.


Â 
I don't buy that. You always have a general sense of the next season while writing the current one.
Â 
Who's to say this is the last of Yara this year? Tune in Next WeekÂ© Â  --Shame we won't get the ADWD quote, but no doubt the show will still pull off a dramatic reunion.

Â 
I don't really see it as screwed. It seems like a more solid callback than his S2 blunder (which was easier to call back to in the books). It still fits his "you have to remember your name" bit, as he sees her as his sister Asha/Yara.Â

Â 
You could be right, though I'd say Round 2 of Boltons vs Greyjoys at Moat Cailin would be too much.Â 
Â 
We might see Yara at the Iron Islands or at least going back there, who knows. I still think this episode's events won't have significant repercussions moving forward, which is both a good and bad thing, in my opinion
2531	The brown snake	2014-05-12	I think Boltons Vs Greyjoys will happen...
There wasn't much of the rescue expected a lot more.

Â 
Well, yeah, but Asha's shock and disbelief when looking at what he'd become for the first time is lost. But like I said, I think she still would have recognized him even without this detour, because Alfie Allen looks pretty much the same, so that's one of the things that only work in the books, I guess
2533	Pallantides	2014-05-12	Â 
You're right.  Those big Hollywood movies, where the main character always does something reallyÂ undeniablyÂ badass cool before he makes hisÂ epic getaway, are so much more realistic and believable than tonight's episode. 


Â 

I don't care if she made something undeniably badass cool. The fact that she stood there watching Ramsay fumble with the lock and didn't even try to do anything is what made it bad. She's an ironborn, made her grand speech, would have probably rather died than flee, and she stood there and did nothing while he messed around as a shirtless man with his guard down took out a key, fumbled with a lock, and had his back towards her.
Â 
Why? Why didn't she do anything? She wasn't in shock to kill armoured men, but she was in too much shock to even attempt to kill a mostly naked man who had his guard completely down? That's not believable that she wouldn't have tried to even do anything except stand there and watch.

Â 
I'll have to give Breaking Bad another try at one point in my life maybe. Train heist sounds far more interesting than anything I saw in the first 3 episodes.  An old man in his underwear in the desert turned me off so fast.
Â 
@Jon - I don't think tonight will have significant repercussions, either. And I don't want a Yara vs Ramsay round 2 at Moat Cailin, but I think having her merely associated with the whole Moat Cailin arc (say she gets there first and leaves for Pyke before Theon Greyjoy arrives) is a smart way to keep her intact in the story before the Iron Islands cast arrives in Season 5.
Â 
Apparently, some think she should've just stayed in Pyke having cool chats with her cool father Balon. (???.....I'm lost on that one.)
2535	SkaggCannibal	2014-05-12	So this plot was even more pointless than anyone predicted. Just a few minutes to remind us Yara is still alive. How easily can people walk in and out of the Dreadfort? Roose you have a pathetic castle.

Â 
Yeah, no, I'm not complaining about that sequence tonight (the thing with the dogs was awful, but that's it). You're right, it's a good way to keep Asha relevant. As far as "filler" (if it does count as that) goes, I enjoyed this one way more than the one at Craster's
2537	SeventySeven	2014-05-12	The thing is, they never seem to change the big plots, so it has become rather predictable now that every deviation will eventually fix itself and not impact the bigger plot too much, but it's a shame that it ruined the Asha/Theon reunion later on now.
Â 
The scene was... ok. It was good to see Asha, but I wasn't overly impressed with the whole thing.
2538	ovis alba	2014-05-12	Seemed very squeezed in. Like someone sat there with a checklist. Nudity? Done  Oberyn making sex comment? Done Moment of surprise? Done ... Oh wait, we don't have any fighting, let's put Ramsay in.
2539	Ice_Specter	2014-05-12	I didn't mind that they deviated but the scene itself felt rushed. Like let's just hurry up and throw Yara in here. Yup kthanxbye
2540	Brother Walfrid	2014-05-12	C'mon, people, let's call it like it is. The writers painted themselves into a corner last season when they decided (for whatever reason) to have Yara rescue Theon.

That's the feeling I got- that they had a plan for Yara in season 4, but had trouble writing it, but that speech at the end of Season 3 had already aired so they just quickly reset things to get Yara back to Iron Islands for the Kingsmoot.
2541	MercyTheBlindUglyLittleCat	2014-05-12	Im so confused with what they are doing with Asha (I hate saying Yara) now. I want to think the plan will add up to getting her where she should be for ADWD material, but I cant be confident. At least I think they are doing right by Reek.
2542	Frey Pies	2014-05-12	How could you people hate that scene?Â 
Â 
Well, I'm not surprised, since you hated Craster's too. The scene was necessary to give us insight as to how far Theon has fallen, since we ar not privy to his thoughts in the show. It was a cool scene- Iwan Rheon and Alfie Allen killed it. Also, the reason she ran away was not the dogs on their own, but all the other factors that played out combined. People are so good at seeing things like this in the books, but completely miss them in the show sometimes because of their refusal to accept that the show is capable of inventing scenes and making them good.
2543	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-05-12	So this plot was even more pointless than anyone predicted. Just a few minutes to remind us Yara is still alive. How easily can people walk in and out of the Dreadfort? Roose you have a pathetic castle.


Oh don't worry a D&D apologist would soon show up and say how meaningful this scene was.Â
2544	LordStoneheart	2014-05-12	Horrible scene, and that's really all there is to it. It's not even about the deviations. They can make awesome work with some deviations. the Craster's Keep stuff wasn't horrible except maybe the final fight scene. Gendry as Edric was clever (except for Leech Cock, but they needed to fill the sex quota, I guess). Arya and Tywin was interesting.
Â 
But this? Just horrendous.
Â 
The problem here is that Ramsay obviously has to live for later, as does Asha, but pitting these two characters who have important roles later leaves very little room for realism. Basically, Cogman had to work this scene around their what I might call plot armor. They both have to live, yet raiding a fort seems like a task in which many casualties would take place. Ramsay couldn't die here even though shirtless in a tiny room would've left him quite battered. Asha couldn't die here but now she just looks like an idiot for raiding a lord's castle with like five soldiers and running from the mere threat of two dogs. So, what, Ramsay turns to unlock the dogs... now what?
Â 
Throw your damn ax at him, Asha! Throw it!!!!
Â 
Gah. This scene was not needed in the slightest. It makes no sense from a book standpoint, and in general I'm not a book purist, but this makes me question whether D&D and B have even paid attention during Reek's chapters.
Â 
All in all, a badly written, badly staged, bad in concept superfluous scene.
2545	Pod The Impaler	2014-05-12	C'mon, people, let's call it like it is. The writers painted themselves into a corner last season when they decided (for whatever reason) to have Yara rescue Theon.

Â 
Â 
Asha would never have been afraid of some mangy dogs.Â  Who is this Yara woman and why did she not just show Ramsay the finger dance before he turned that key? 
Â 
And what - did Roose take some NyQuil before the night of Yara's attack ? Now, if Roose showed up with 100 more men, then it is back to the boat time. He is not a man to be undone.
(Incidentally, how the hell did she sail to the Dreadfort? I guess her journey must have taken several months.)
Â 
In any case, I think you're right - it looks like the writers painted themselves into a corner with her desire to rescue Theon. The dramatic disappointment at what he'd become was I suppose realistic, but otherwise they would have been better off if they had called off the scene in favour of her not knowing what's been done to him, or never making it there.Â

Â 
I don't think we're meant to read the scene as Asha being afraid of the dogs, but that she realised Theon is no more so she can't save him... (unless you're being sarcastic, I've underslept and I can't tellÂ  Â )

Oh, there was definitely sarcasm there.
2548	Koi No Yokan	2014-05-12	I don't think it takes much presence of mind to realise that the entire Dreadfort had been alerted to their presence, and that the hounds were the last thing they had to worry about. Ironborn fight until they die, yes - but not for a cause they don't believe in. Asha didn't see Theon, she saw Reek.
Â 
Overall, I was excited for this arc, and I thought it was going along well until Ramsay entered the kennels. Then it just began to feel a little too disjointed and rushed.
Â 
Pretty disappointed with the end result, but I'm just so fucking relieved Asha didn't become a torture victim. Hooray for Asha at the Kingsmoot!

2550	Ran	2014-05-12	I admit, I was waiting for Yara to throw her axe into Ramsay's head when he decided to just turn around to fumble with the lock.
Â 
Obviously, Yara isn't fit to carry Asha's jockstrap.
Â 
I think the specific moment of interaction with Reek was terrific. I think the scene afterward with the bath was also terrific. The stuff leading up to it was poorly done, and yeah, I think they painted themselves into a corner.
Â 
I would have used another "hunting" scene and an ambush of same to try and get across something at least somewhat similar. They capture Ramsay and Theon, maybe kill off Myranda, Theon ends up dissembling enough that Asha doesn't have him tied up and carried ... only to run away and get the garrison to chase down Asha and co., who give up Ramsay or something in exchange for getting away.
Â 
Something like that, anyways. I'm sure there are other possibilities that allow the Greyjoys to learn how far gone Theon is, without breaking suspension of disbelief. Would, I suppose, have taken longer to really establish, but the attack on the Dreadfort should have taken a lot longer to establish, too, if they wanted to go that route.

2551	LordStoneheart	2014-05-12	Yeah the Reek writing was cool. the bath scene was... I don't even know how to describe it. Psychotically adorable in a disgusting way? I'm sure it's going to set Ramsey/Theon shippers on tumblr crazy.
2552	yushkevitch	2014-05-12	I didn't read all the replies in this thread relating to the dogs but my own .02 is that Asha, being from the Iron Islands may not have had much exposure to puppies (or kittens) growing up.
Â 
So when faced with the prospect of a very big, very intimidating dog having her for lunch I have little doubt that getting the heck out of Dodge would be an appropriate response.
2553	SpaA<U+009F>vogel	2014-05-12	It was the dumbest scene ever filmed. Not for the show (which has been categorically awful), but the dumbest scene ever filmed EVER. Let's introduce a seven minute rescue where the rescue doesn't happen and the villain lets the other heir of the Iron Isles just run away?


Â 
I thought it was clear at the beginning of the scene that her men are fighting all over the castle, and that her jaunt to rescue Theon was dangerous.Â  She says that they can't linger.Â  She says they'll get trapped down there, and it certainly looks like they nearly do get trapped.Â  I think the reason they fled was that their position was not tenable.Â  However the show really cheaped out on the dogs.Â  Jump cut to them leaping into their rowboats was a little on the lame side.Â
2554	Moseh Khayim	2014-05-12	Why fight for something that was already lost. Maybe this could have established Asha as badass, but also as a good tactician (seeing all the comments, they seem to have failed in that). There was nothing to gain and a whole lot to lose by staying there.
Â 
But, I may be a little prejudice. I just love badass women in ASOIAF.
2555	ovis alba	2014-05-12	How could you people hate that scene?Â 
Â 
Well, I'm not surprised, since you hated Craster's too.


Â 
I didn't like this one but I liked Craster's. What now?
And I actually did like the part in the bath afterwards, but the "fighting" before was just way too rushed and didn't make much sense to me. (They are really standing there watching him, while he takes his time to open the cage giving a little speech? Either leave directly or attack him, but don't stand there listening until he's done.Â   )
2556	ovis alba	2014-05-12	Yeah the Reek writing was cool. the bath scene was... I don't even know how to describe it. Psychotically adorable in a disgusting way? I'm sure it's going to set Ramsey/Theon shippers on tumblr crazy.


Â 
That's why I actually in retrospect found the sex scene before was not as useless as I initially thought.
2557	Lord Varys	2014-05-12	That one was really a joke. Come on guys, the Dreadfort would never be that vulnerable, nor should Asha be surprised that Theon is not himself anymore after he was tortured, partially flayed, and castrated. Balon realized that when received the box, why couldn't you?
Â 
The scene afterwards is pretty good, but this thing makes no sense in connection to the time line, since Roose already commanded Ramsay and Theon to take Moat Cailin back when he returned to the Dreadfort in the beginning of this season. So what did they do all this time? Nothing? And where the hell is Roose himself? Hiding in his dungeon?
2558	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-05-12	I'm wondering Â what happened to the girl that Ramsay was screwing. Â He went from her to the fight with blood on him.
2559	toffeejay	2014-05-12	Considering Ramsay and Asha weren't going to die I think it would have worked better without Ramsay.
They could have gone all special ops, found Theon but he would have refused to leave fearing that Ramsay was outside. Fight and bite his way free and run to hide somewhere, maybe even raise the alarm.Â 
Â 
Basically the same scene yes but without her looking week against some shirtless bloke. Essentially making the decison to leave an emotional one not a tactical one.
2560	NightStark	2014-05-12	*AHEM!*
Â https://www.youtube....h?v=CVuVYeCJud0That doesn't show it, all that shows is that Theon is not stupid enough to slit his throat because he knows Roose will flay him alive. Anybody who foubd thenselves in that position would have done the same thing.
The Dreadfort scenes had him reject his own sister and the promise of freedom..much more effective.

2561	DominusNovus	2014-05-12	Given that this episode was a few minutes shorter than the rest (51 minutes), its not like they didn't have time to actually fit in something better.
Â 
Just off the top of my head: The Ironborn drag Theon out of the kennels, back up to the wall where the battle started, all the while, he's kicking and trying to scream. Â A few IB are dropped by the guards, and Ramsay is leading the counterattack (hell, he could still be shirtless if you want). Â Quickly show his dogs eating a felled-but-still-alive IB for horror effect. Â Then, as the surviving IB try to drag Theon back over the wall, he cuts and runs back to Ramsay, maybe even cowering behind the Bastard. Â With part of their forces already out of the castle, and others dead, and the Dreadfort garrison surrounding them Yara and the IB have no choice but to retreat. Â As they vault down the walls, make sure to show a few more IB picked off by archers.
Â 
All of that could have been fit into 90 seconds or less of add screen time, or even just the same amount of time given to the kennel battle. Â You still get Reek's personality, you still get man-eating dogs, you still get Shirtless Ramsay, you still get the whole subplot forced back onto the novel rails.
Â 
And it doesn't force a stupid jump cut.

Â 
The Ramsay/Reek scenes were otherwise great though, yeah. I liked how even Ramsay's little gift ended up being pragmatic.Â
2563	Angmar	2014-05-12	Just pure wtf at Ramsay fanservice. Betcha they were thinking of his fangirls up at tumblr.
Â 
And the whole scene was just rushed, it painted Asha looking like a coward, and wtf Ramsay winning a battle shirtless? I thought GOT was always selling itself as "see, we're realistic fantastic, we have violence and sex unlike Tolkien's dumb immortal elves, pay attention to us pleaaase"
2564	AZAXD	2014-05-12	I was sort of like, man are they going to kill off Theon's sister implying she's no longer important in the books? Then I was like, surely they can take these dogs just slice 'em down - you got armor on right?? Then I was like oh well that's done.
Â 
Looking back on it though I do think it is important to show where Theon as Reek is at now, just... maybe it could have been done a little better? I dunno I don't make shows.
Â 
Â 
It's funny, this and the Craster's Keep scenario have both been somewhat anti-climatic and considered "pointless" by many but both had what I feel are important bits of characterization. (Jon's leadership qualities).

Â 
I don't really buy anything about that. Â Obviously Reek was not what she expected, but she has no idea what has happened to him or whether he can recover if returned to some semblance of normalcy. Â The idea that she not only made the instant psychiatric diagnosis (during the heat of battle) that Theonn was irreparably damaged, but also felt no inclination whatsoever to either put him out of his misery or punish those responsible is simply unfathomable.
2566	BlackTalon	2014-05-12	The scene with Yara shows the audience that ...
Â 
.... theon was not playacting, he really is Reek now.
Â 
.... theon will now do Ramsay's bidding in good faith, the viewers need not expect any tricks from him
Â 
.... Yara has no more reason to plan any more rescue attempts, her brother is dead to her.
Â 
Â 
I am really growing sick and tired of all the folks bleating "Hey I don't understand this, it must be, like, useless filler!!1!!1" over and over again.
Â 
Also, the blood on ramsay's body show that the Ironborn were fighting throughout the castle, if he had backed them into a corner and fought them to the death his own casualties would have been too great. He was therefore content to let yara go, and she was content to leve herself as she could clearly see her brother existed no more.

Right. Â At the very least, if she decided Theon was irredeemable, she would have slit his throat, not leave him there alive. Â

It's not that what it was aiming to show character-wise (Reek and Ramsay's disturbing "relationship") was bad, it's that it was executed beyond poorly.Â

When did GOT become Lord of the Rings. So much for realism. Although Gendry did kill a Lannister soldier in Season 2 so its not something new.
Â 
On the bright side Asha is going back to the Iron Islands for the Kingsmoot hopefully.Â 
Â 
All in all a pointless filler scene but it still made for some entertaining TV. There is no doubt Theon is Reek but it ruins the last chapter in ADWD where he meets Asha.Â

Â 
I agree with your other points but literally two minutes after this scene we see this. 'So much for realism' for this series ended with the prologue.Â
2574	Lord Jennings	2014-05-12	entertaining scene none the less. Actually found myself rooting for the ironborn which, aside from Victarion, doesn't happen.
Â 
Also think Alfie Allen is doing a fantastic, fantastic job and this episode helpedÂ solidify that for me.
2575	Inv1ctus	2014-05-12	The scene was done poorly imo but I'm glad that they finally shown us completely broken Theon (or is he? ). I'm glad Iwan Rheon is playing Ramsay and Alfie did a great job in this episode. But chronologically it seems a little off, Roose told Ramsay to take Moat Cailin quite some time ago (Locke got to the wall in the mean time) and they're still at Dreadfort like nobody's business. The Dreadfort scene was done for one thing and one thing only, to show the viewers that Theon is completely broken apart. And I don't mind that they used one scene for that but it could have been done way better. Luckily the ending of the episode was so intense that I simply don't care about the other scenes.

Â 
Not sure if you're trolling or actually trying to make a point, but having believable and realistic character-driven drama in a medieval fantasy world is exactly what makes (made) the show so compelling. Â He's talking about the plot, you're talking about the setting.
Â 
In other words, he's talking about something relevant and you're "answering" with something completely irrelevant. Â Not exactly a valuable contribution to the conversation...

That's one of my biggest problems with the show. They are really bad at giving a feeling for space or time. Even in Season 1 when they showed the passing of time with help of the Direwolves it felt really flat.
Â 
I blame it partly on the editing, it's just so mechanical at times.
2578	Jussi	2014-05-12	This scene could be from Martin's original plans. The first blurb for A Feast for Crows said in 2002:
Â 
While the remaining northern lords war endlessly with each other and the ironmen of the isles attack the Dreadfort
2579	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-12	The scene with Yara shows the audience that ...
Â 
.... theon was not playacting, he really is Reek now.
Â 
.... theon will now do Ramsay's bidding in good faith, the viewers need not expect any tricks from him
Â 
.... Yara has no more reason to plan any more rescue attempts, her brother is dead to her.
Â 


Â 
i agree...since they had already shown Yara goings against Balon's wishes to rescue Theon (which made sense because of their moment at winterfell where seemed to still care a bit for him), this scene was necessary to convince her completely that she should be Balon's heir, makes her fight harder at the Kingsmoot....
Â 
could it have been better? well sure, but since its out of book content, im sure no matter how they did it, a significant portion of people would find something to nitpick about...
Â 
question is, was it entertaining to watch? imo, yes...watching a truly broken Theon was amazing, watching the mini-fight sequence between the dreadfort and ironborn was entertaining...watching Yara's reaction to Reek cowering in his cage was dramatic...

Â 
So then when she sees him again....is she just going to tell him to fuck off, he's dead to her? Â LOL. Â Or are they going to have to rig up some other inane plot change because they already had the non dramatic "dramatic" scene of Asha and Theon coming face to face?
2581	Pib_Juju	2014-05-12	C'mon, people, let's call it like it is. The writers painted themselves into a corner last season when they decided (for whatever reason) to have Yara rescue Theon. This episode was just Cogman trying to walk away from that mess without screwing those storylines in a major way. Of course it was clumsy, as course-correction in tv shows usually is


Â 
That's exactly what I thought. It seemed like, 'shit, we just had to give Asha that, 'I'm off to rescue my bro!' montage, and now we've gotta at least address that'.
Â 
Felt very contrived and nonsensical.
2582	Bastard of the Dreadfort	2014-05-12	Ramsay was against armour, swords and shields... He should of been f*cked. I agree with everyone that says Yara should have axed him while he was opening the dog cages.Â 
I'm utterly bewildered by this scene.Â 
Â 
Also, why show him screwing Myranda? I was so sure from last week's promo that he was going to kill her after sex... Hence the seeming scratch/blood marks on his body... But ultimately, what was the point? Was it to show that despite having ridiculously loud sex, he still heard the grappling claws?
Â 
I'm so angry by this nonsense!!!Â

2583	King Tommen	2014-05-12	I have the feeling that there's a scene on the cutting room floor that shows something happening with Myranda and Ramsay right after the Ironborn breach the walls of the Dreadfort. You can hear the sex going on while Yara is questioning the guard about Theon's whereabouts. And there is no explanation of why Ramsay was all bloodied up when he finally gets to the kennels.
Â 
I'm not sure why you make such a point of showing the Myranda/Ramsay sex scene intercut with the attack (besides obviously naked people) unless there was going to be an end to that sequence with her.
Â 
I'll be surprised if we see Myranda again because she's probably dead, they just chose not to show it because the editing didn't work or the execution of the scene wasn't what they wanted to be, they cut it for time etc. I bet we get a deleted scene on the BluRay a la Irri/Doreah in S2.

Â 
Yeah seemed to me that way too. I assumed he just did something to Myranda after having sex and then coming right to the kennels, especially since he was so enthusiastic to fight.
Â 
But still, the episode was only 50min long so why couldn't they keep in a short shot to show what happened. It's not like they didn't have time.
2585	Chuck88	2014-05-12	^ Noticed this as well. The cuts seem slightly off and we never actually see the slap that appeared in the first trailer.Â
2586	Envie	2014-05-12	Well after reading pages of this debate I have to say it looks like most people are in the same camp that the scene felt rushed, nonsensical and not very realistic. Yes, we all get it that this is fantasy and therefore we must suspend disbelief for some things. In this case a few of you who are vehemently defending the scene are asking us to suspend disbelief by a noose and pretend it's still breathing. It was just too much. It could have been done better and was just a serious WTF moment - admit it.
2587	Onna Lewyys	2014-05-12	Maybe they decided that 4 episodes in a row including horrible violence toward women would finally have been too much.
2588	King Tommen	2014-05-12	Â

Â 
Lots of reasons as I mentioned. The scene didn't go off the way they wanted it to or they just thought the sequence at the Dreadfort was too long and they wanted to get to King's Landing for the trial etc. The same thing happened in the Renly/shadow death scene where the original sequence with the shadow coming off the wall of the tent (as you can see they are setting up) didn't work for whatever reason so they had to cut the scene differently to accommodate this.
Â 
And I get why they would have to keep the sex scene in to make it clear why Ramsay would appear later only in his bare torso and the intercutting with Yara's speech probably only works if you have them going back and forth from the Ironborn to the Dreadfort.
Â 
I wonder if Cogman would ever confirm if Myranda was dead if someone asked him.

Â 
Maybe they wanted to be all artsy and do something similar to American Psycho. But the editing in this show can be so awkward at times. They goy better though, but the cutting in season 2 was by far the worst in that regard.

2590	Jojosh	2014-05-12	This whole scene seemed so very un AGOT. I mean first you make Ramsay fight bare and then you have asha just abandoning theon instead of you know killing him and depriving ramsay of the hostage she made such a big deal about last season.
Pointless filler sums it up good
2591	protar	2014-05-12	Well this wasn't entirely a waste of time I suppose. It fully and completely enforces just how broken Theon is, and sets up the Moat Cailin plot line, but at the same time both those things had already been established, just to a lesser degree. Interested in seeing where they'll take Yara now. Is she just going to head back to the Iron Isles and they'll continue with the KM as planned? I do find it funny how we spent so long discussing what they'll do with Locke and what they'll do with Yara's mission and suddenly Locke is dead and Yara is fleeing home again. I didn't get the impression Myranda was dead. I thought Ramsay was just covered in blood from fighting the rest of Yara's men - all fifty of them weren't in that room, presumably there were more outside he killed.
2592	Hath4	2014-05-12	In the first trailer we saw myranda slap ramsay, but that wasn't there last night so they cut from them before that happens, so I think ramsay probably killed her after having some really violent sex.
2593	protar	2014-05-12	Â 
I agree with your other points but literally two minutes after this scene we see this. 'So much for realism' for this series ended with the prologue.Â 


Â 
Ah, the good old "it's fantasy" logic doesn't matter argument. Internal consistency is a thing you know and there's nothing in this setting that would allow Ramsay to not die if he got hit with a sword whilst shirtless.Â
2594	Labirints	2014-05-12	In the trailerÂ Dreadfort scene looked awesome. Though it was disappointing, easily the worst part of this episode. I loved how Ramsay was releasing the hounds for like 20 seconds and everyone just stared and did nothing about it.. just horrible.Â
2595	WTF's a Lommy	2014-05-12	The scene reminded me of Monty Python and the Holy Grail when they attacked the French castle. Â

ATTACK! Â {gets pelted with livestock} Â ...RUN AWAY!

Â 
Some arguments have merits about the usefulness of the entire plotline but in terms of what happened at the end, if you watch, after Theon bites Yara's hand and retreats into the cage, Ramsay and his men scuffle with Yara and her men and they end up in basically an even standoff with the spots reversed and Ramsay now protecting Theon's cage and Yara with her back to the exit door. Then he pulls out the key to release the dogs and gives her the chance to run. She couldn't get to Theon if she tried at that point, the dogs and Ramsay and his men were between her and that cage.
Â 
So I don't have a problem with that. Although, those are some slow-ass dogs to not be able to get Yara and her men before she got back to the shore.
2597	Raffles	2014-05-12	I thought it was a terrible scene. Yara left the Iron Islands with a short hairdo.. and has 12 months of hair growth on her head by the time she arrives at the Dreadfort? That's some journey! Â 
Â 
Also, why did they not kill the dogs when they entered the kennels? After Yara slit the throat of their guide, I fully expected her to say matter-of-factly, "Kill the dogs", but no..
Â 
Then Ramsey enters, with no armour on.. and they don't target him? Hmm..
Â 
And then, when all hope for Theon is lost Yara decides it's time to leave.. but is not stopped by Ramsay.. he in fact let's her go? Why would he do that? And he didn't even release the hounds.. only implied the threat. Or did I miss something here?
Â 
Overall, a HUGE letdown.. I'm very disappointed with that scene
2598	WTF's a Lommy	2014-05-12	To sail to the Dreadfort from the Iron Islands you would have to go south all the way to Dorn, sail around Dorn, turn north and go all the way back up as far as you came down then somehow find a way to sail on land because the Dreadfort is no where near the sea. Â It took Sam an entire book to make the journey from Eastwatch by the Sea to Oldtown (shorter distance) so I doubt she would have made it there by now. Â The whole scene was one huge swing and a miss. Â If its any indication of what the show writers are capable of coming up with then when the show catches up to the books the show is in serious trouble.
2599	sati	2014-05-12	Did anyone notice Ramsay's scene was shortened? In the trailer Myranda slaps him. I think this and whatever resulted in those cuts on him was removed from the episode. Did they kill her off screen? She probably had more screen time this year than some actual important characters.

Â 
You have some weird complaints. The dogs are locked up. Do you think it's a good idea to unlock each of their cages and try and take out a wild animal as it charges at you from close range? They were trying to get Theon out of there as quickly and quietly as possible, not slaughter everyone at the Dreadfort.
Â 
Ramsay enters with a bunch of his men and they all attack together. How are you supposed to target him and forget about the other soldiers swinging weapons at you?
Â 
Ramsay is protecting Theon's cell and is in a standoff with Yara's group who both have roughly the same numbers. His unleashing the hounds is to tip the scales in his favour. I think the implication here is that his main concern is keeping Theon and he doesn't really give a shit about the attackers as long as they leave, dead or alive.Â  He knows that Theon denying Yara a rescue has probably done the trick anyways.
Â 
You can hear the hounds barking after Yara when they race back to their boats so they are released but it strains credibility somewhat that they weren't caught by them I'll agree.

Ha! I knew it reminded me of something. Would be even better if Yara took the castle by herself just killing everyone in sight (or not in sight) including Fat Walda.

Â 
If I had to guess, they originally had the scene of her slapping him at the end of the sex and then almost immediately she gets skewered by a random Ironborn who makes it into the room, which is why Ramsay is bloodstained afterwards. When all of the Ironborn are up on the castle walls, you can tell that Ramsay's room is very close because you can hear the sex groans. They cut out her death almost assuredly.

I've seen this brought up several places. It IS on the Weeping Water...which would be why they abandoned their ship shown during "Yara's" speech for the smaller skiffs to navigate the river. Then when returning to the skiffs she said to return to the ship, Theon is dead.
Â 
Yes it is a great distance and pretty silly...but it seems to be very easily accessed via water.

i've always thought of the Greyjoys like that...since the books, they raid villages along the coast line and then run away to their ships...
Â 
doesn't mean they are cowards, just drawing out the enemy...their strength is on the water while they are weak on land...so they go in, cause a raucous and then run away to their ships and wait for their enemy...
Â 
i will admit that the scene felt rushed, wish they took away a few minutes from Reek/Ramsay awkward "do you love me" bath scene and spent it on Yara...meh...Tyrion's trial made up for itÂ

Suspension of disbelief also requires you to suspend a sense of time and distance in this show. They do it all the time. The fact that Locke somehow teleported up to the wall and had been there for weeks (or months) as a new recruit off on adventures with Jon Snow to Craster's Keep happening simultaneously with Ramsay NOT going to Moat Cailin and instead hanging out at the Dreadfort for months even though both Locke and Ramsay were given their individual orders by Roose Bolton at the same time... plus the fact you pointed out that Yara and crew getting to the Dreadfort in little boats even though it's the wrong side of the map from the Iron Islands - uh yeah... more suspension of space and time.Â 
Â 
They're counting on most television viewers not knowing the map very well and compacting the timeline and distance I guess.

One point on the "little boats" thing. They actually came on a "big boat". We saw it in the S3 finale as well as the sequence at the start of this episode. They only got on the little skiffs to navigate up the Weeping water as it is a smaller river. Then at the end of the episode, Yara says "let's go back to the ship, Theon's dead" to reinforce the notion that they made the big trip around Westeros (which again, they started in the S3 finale) in one of their longships.
Â 
Not to mention that Yara stated exactly what her navigational path was going to be in the S3 finale before she left.

There's suspension of belief and then there's the audience not paying attention (which happens to show-only and avid book readers alike).

Â 
She couldn't get to Theon at that point as Ramsay with his men were standing between them. Not sure why this is so difficult to grasp. She's heartbroken that he's broken this much, not sure why this means she needs to kill him. And clearly given the situation, she couldn't even if she wanted to.
2616	Raksha 2014	2014-05-12	As someone who works with and studies dogs, I think people are seriously underestimating just how dangerous and intimidating they are.Â 


Â 
Â 
I'm still trying to figure out what breed of dog was used for Ramsay's "Girls". Â Boerbels, Presa Canarios/Canary Dogs, Cane Corsos?Â 
Â 
Anyway, the dogs were definitely dangerous. Â But Asha had time to throw an axe or a dagger into Ramsay's arm and prevent him from unleashing them because Ramsay had to ham it up for half a minute while brandishing the keys to the kennel and chitchatting with her. Â Why didn't she even try to prevent him from opening the cages? Â It was like, 'okay, let's stand back and let the shirtless sadist preen and threaten us without lifting a finger, or an axe, to cut him down'. Â It just made sense, for the Seven's sake, these are Ironborn, veteran fighters. Â Also, did none of the Ironborn have a bow and arrows to wound the dogs before they were unleashed?
2617	King Tommen	2014-05-12	I feel like the people mad about the logistics of the episode are having a really tough time understanding the entire sequence and perhaps need a re-watch to get exactly what is going on there.

It was certainly a little rushed but I get what they were going for.
Â 
My issue is more with the notion that they absolutely had to send Yara on a mission in the finale which was going to result in her immediately heading back home just so they could find something for her to do before the Kingsmoot in S5. The funny thing is, they could have easily inserted some scenes with her and Balon on Pyke this season before he died that could have provided more background to their family dynamic and the Ironborn in general that would have probably had the audience more on board with her character than this excursion did.

This so much. That really irks me too, unless they somehow get Stannis' fleet to pick her up since they are heading North and are in the Narrow Sea I see no reason why they absolutely had her do that trip from a narrative standpoint.
2620	Cas Stark	2014-05-12	I saw what went on.
Â 
A shirtless person brandished the key to the dog pen...and they left/were allowed to leave. Â They didnt' attempt to kill the shirtless person or give Theon the gift of mercy by throwing an ax or a knife at either one. Â And then, also, miraculously, the shirtless sadist apparently does not loose the hounds or in any other way prevent the IB from leaving the Dreadfort, because they get away. Â Silly.

Â 
I was being facetious with the "little boats" comment and I'm fully aware they came on a bigger ship. You're over analyzing things and spending a lot of effort defending this scene. Admit it, the timeline and distance were skewed a lot to make this scene happen and it doesn't make a lot of sense. I would think someone who is so passionate for remembering the 'details' would also be a stickler for the timeline and distance discrepancies which are making this sequence of events a bit hard to make sense of in the show. That's not even discussing how short and nonsensical the whole confrontation between "Yara" and Ramsay was...Â

2622	A Raven	2014-05-12	This detour really didn't do anything. Theon was already established by Reek and Moat Cailin set up very nicely by Martin in episode 2 during the shaving scene. Yara had this quest because they tacked it on to the end of the third season. It runs contrary to the Hound smacking down Arya and saying that Syrio Forell got killed because Meryn Trant had 'armor and a big fucking sword' - so shirtless Ramsay with his little knives doesn't even get injured by the ironborn, who were wearing armor and longer weapons?Very strange, the whole thing. The only utilities I can see are delaying Moat Cailin (Why? Where was Roose Bolton during this? I don't know why they'd want to slow down the Bolton arc by spending additional time on them; they simply could have omitted the Dreadfort scenes this episode and have Moat Cailin happen next episode anyway.), keeping Yara away from the Iron Islands (again, why? To provide an opportunity for Balon to die without a direct heir on the island?), and bringing her around to Balon's viewpoint ('I have no son.'), which she could have been written to agree with plausibly in the first place.Craster's Keep had a few things going on that it could at least say it did for the story. I'm somewhat at a loss to justify this one. Maybe they'll throw some twists in the next couple episodes, but this sequence just seems like a mistake.
2623	Sam with Hooters	2014-05-12	He did. I doubt he bothered releasing the dogs, he just threatened to do so. Those dogs are what? Something like Cane Corsos or Boerbols? Killing people wouldnt be too difficult for them.


But we're not talking about the defenseless women Ramsay usually sics hisÂ dogs on but on armed and armored warriors.Â  Would dogs really be much of a threat in that case?Â

Â 
I wondered that too. It's not like the Ironborn are heavily armored but they still must wear chain mail at least. And they had shields.

2625	Pod The Impaler	2014-05-12	The one thing I did like about her raid was the beginning - grapple hooks, dead guards and on on.
Â 
Bare-shirted Ramsay having a chance in pitched battle against armoured Ironborn including Yara ?Â 
Â 
(Hmm, the Hound would have something to say about that.)

Â 
The Freys had no problem drilling poor caged Greywind with arrows; the Ironborn should have shot several arrows into Ramsay's caged dogs and a few into Ramsay as well while Ramsay was chattering about unleashing them. Â Not to mention an axe or two into Ramsay's arms and over-exposed chest.Â

Â 
I really expected them to killthe dogs that way to silence them. Maybe Ramsay going berserk because someone hurt his girls.
2628	Wagshell	2014-05-12	I thought the scene was good and also pretty important. We, who have read the books, tend to forget how those POV chapters were really gruelling adventures in the mind of a broken and messed up man who had completely given up on who he used to be. TV watchers really haven't had the same experience, just seeing Theon as very scared that he'll be killed or tortured.
Â 
How to make them understand that he really has given up on being a man, on being Theon?
Â 
To do that you have to open the doors of his cage and rescue him, then watch him unable to accept it. Now theTV watchers have seen that he's not just scared of Ramsey, he has accepted that he is Reek and rejects any idea of being Theon. He also thinks any attempt to release him from prison or from being Reek is just a trick.
Â 
The TV series needed something like that, something disturbing, because they can't show the horror in his head like we witnessed.

Â 
I expected he was going to let the dogs out and a crazed fight would ensue where the IB barely make it out alive. Â While that's nothing revelatory or particularly interesting, it at least makes sense and is true to the spirit of Asha's quest. Â Just saying 'oh, fuck it, big dogs, see ya'...is bizarre.

Â 
i thought along those lines for a bit...but they didnt really show what happened between the ironborn and the dogs...could have happened that way and they just decided to skip it in the interest of time...i would have like to see Ramsay a bit more injured while bathing Reek, that would have allowed a stronger reason to believe that the fight continued further than they showed
2631	Raksha 2014	2014-05-12	I'm actually that they didn't kill/wound Ramsay's dogs; even if it's just TV, there's already been enough cruelty to animals on the show. Â Yes, the dogs are dangerous, but it's not their fault, they didn't ask to be trained to be vicious killers (and in the books, they weren't; since Ramsay preferred to torture and slaughter his victims himself, the dogs just tracked the poor girls and held them at bay for Ramsay to capture; in the books, the dogs seem to adopt Theon and give him shelter and physical contact/warming). Â But given the supposedly realistic nature of combat and fighting (and Ironborn culture in the books) in the show, Asha and her men should have been shooting Ramsay and his dogs the minute he held up the key, or even sooner.
2632	King Tommen	2014-05-12	Â 
I was being facetious with the "little boats" comment and I'm fully aware they came on a bigger ship. You're over analyzing things and spending a lot of effort defending this scene. Admit it, the timeline and distance were skewed a lot to make this scene happen and it doesn't make a lot of sense. I would think someone who is so passionate for remembering the 'details' would also be a stickler for the timeline and distance discrepancies which are making this sequence of events a bit hard to make sense of in the show. That's not even discussing how short and nonsensical the whole confrontation between "Yara" and Ramsay was...Â 
Â 
It was just not done right.


Â 
Given what we know about travel by water on the show, I don't see how the trip to the Dreadfort (which started from Pyke in the S3 finale) on a longship wouldn't take until roughly episode 6 to complete. It's not that ridiculous. It's not a fleet that's lumbering along, it's one ship ("the fastest" as Yara said in the S3 finale) and they went non-stop.
Â 
The stuff that happens on foot on the show is more open to nitpicking IMO. The stuff on sea I don't understand the complaints because no one is going to be able to say with any degree of certainty how fast a ship can travel in Westeros.
Â 
At least the show told us exactly where she planned to go and how she planned to do it which was a lot less than we usually get.
2633	DominusNovus	2014-05-12	It runs contrary to the Hound smacking down Arya and saying that Syrio Forell got killed because Meryn Trant had 'armor and a big fucking sword' - so shirtless Ramsay with his little knives doesn't even get injured by the ironborn, who were wearing armor and longer weapons?


Â 
I was just thinking that exact same thing. Â And wasn't the Hound's speech to her just the previous week?

Â 
While shooting the dogs with crossbows through the pens would have made more tactical sense in that scene, I'm guessing they did not want to go the animal cruelty route like you said and obviously they had decided in making the scene that Ramsay was going to be the decisive winner (sans shirt and all) and that Yara would retreat.Â 
Â 
But even that retreat made no sense. As others have said - the two sides were fairly evenly matched at that point and Yara had the upper hand in threatening him to let Theon go or more men would die ... and all he had to do was turn the key in the lock of the dog pens to turn the entire fight in his favor. It just wasn't that believable.

Â 
I'm all for not showing the dogs get killed, but at least let them out and show them rushing the IB...and then they can cut to Asha leaving. Â It would still be somewhat inexplicable how any of the IB would survive...but to leave it with the sense that Ramsay let them go/and they choose to cut their losses and go is SO BAD.
2636	Khal-a-bunga	2014-05-12	Â 
I was just thinking that exact same thing. Â And wasn't the Hound's speech to her just the previous week?


Â 
Yes, because the words of wisdom from The Hound are applicable in any scenario ever, and there aren't plenty of examples within the narrative of his ideology not being 100% factually correct (Bronn in the Eyrie, for example).Â
2637	King Tommen	2014-05-12	I saw what went on.
Â 
A shirtless person brandished the key to the dog pen...and they left/were allowed to leave. Â They didnt' attempt to kill the shirtless person or give Theon the gift of mercy by throwing an ax or a knife at either one. Â And then, also, miraculously, the shirtless sadist apparently does not loose the hounds or in any other way prevent the IB from leaving the Dreadfort, because they get away. Â Silly.


Â 
Since we did indeed hear the dogs barking and getting closer as Yara got back on her boat, the implication is that he definitely did sic them on her. Now either we're supposed to believe that the dogs are really slow or he wanted to play games with them to give them a bit of a head start, then ok, that's a little silly.
Â 
But the standoff in the kennels is about Yara realizing that Theon is too far gone and not worth rescuing. Ramsay and his men stand between her and Theon at this point (which is a reversal of where they stood at the start of the scene). Yara and her men have their backs to the door and can get away if they like. It's Ramsay's notion that he's going to sic the dogs on them that's the final straw (along with Theon's refusal to leave).
Â 
I don't really have a problem with the way it played out. Is it kind of dumb that Ramsay's fighting with his shirt off? Sure. But he's not alone so if he's in a couple of close melees, then he could certainly keep himself alive for a little while.
2638	Carl Rhaego	2014-05-12	I think this was one of the worst scenes of the entire show. The build up started in S3E10 and it amounted to nothing and it was as anticlimactic as it could have been. Ramsay fighting shirtless with two daggers and not getting a scratch while his fully armored men get cut down like butter was all kinds of stupid. Then Yara and her men just stood there staring at his nipples as he slowly takes out a key and shows it to them in slow motion. I mean, no one thought it would be a good idea to attack him and just take the keys? Then Yara and her badass Ironborn soldiers run away like scared little girls from a bunch of caged dogs? I actually laughed out at that montage of showing the key and then one second later we see Yara and her men running to the boat like babies. It was like a silly cartoon.

Â 
So you admit there were a few things that just seemed like bad writing choices, right?Â 
Â 
1. Dogs are barking during their retreat - we assume Ramsay let the dogs go but the dogs didn't catch them rushing back to their boats ...
Â 
2. Yara and crew have Ramsay and crew cornered in the kennel and the upper hand but choose not to attack again and instead retreat because they're closer to the door ...
Â 
3. Ramsay doesn't chase after them or get more men to stop them before they get to the boats? Wouldn't having BOTH Greyjoys as prisoners be a double win win for the Boltons against the Ironborn at that point? I know that didn't happen in the books but I just can't see Ramsay not taking that opportunity when it was right there in front of him.
Â 
4. Shirtless Ramsay fought in close quarters with multiple armed and armored men and didn't take a single injury - super villain mode.Â 
Â 
All of these points just lead up to one summary: badly done fabricated scene.
2640	Facelesss Fan	2014-05-12	True Ironborn would have killed the dogs, knocked Theon/Reek out. and slaughtered shirtless Ramsey on the way out. That being said for the non-book readers this scene did expose Theon;s total conversion into Reek.

Â 
would definitely agree if they had more men...as it was, few ironborn against whole garrison of dreadfort (they did have to get out before the whole castle came down and trapped them in) not unreasonable for them to bolt...they aren't dothraki after all Â
2642	Khal-a-bunga	2014-05-12	Â 
So you admit there were a few things that just seemed like bad writing choices, right?Â 
Â 
1. Dogs are barking during their retreat - we assume Ramsay let the dogs go but the dogs didn't catch them rushing back to their boats ...
Â 
As far as I can tell, something as simple as closed door would have slowed down the dogs, and allowed them more time to escape. Or are we to assume that there were no doors in the Dreadfort? I'm not saying they shouldn't have shown some of Yara's escape, but since they didn't, it seems like a logical idea to use common sense to extrapolate how relatively easy it could be to slow down the hounds.
Â 
2. Yara and crew have Ramsay and crew cornered in the kennel and the upper hand but choose not to attack again and instead retreat because they're closer to the door ...
Â 
Yara and crew have just a few of the men they actually brought into the castle still living, and a castle full of Bolton men still remain outside of the kennel. They hardly had the upper-hand. If anything, they were on even ground (for a very short amount of time, at least) before Ramsay went to open the cage that held the dogs. Any further delay, and they could have been surrounded.Â 
Â 
3. Ramsay doesn't chase after them or get more men to stop them before they get to the boats? Wouldn't having BOTH Greyjoys as prisoners be a double win win for the Boltons against the Ironborn at that point? I know that didn't happen in the books but I just can't see Ramsay not taking that opportunity when it was right there in front of him.
Â 
Again, it would have been nice to see Yara and her men escaping, but I don't think it's implied that Ramsay simply allowed them to leave. More likely is that he did give chase, but Yara and her few remaining men were able to escape due to the surprise nature of their attack. It's a scenario not all that dissimilar to how Theon was able to sack Winterfell - he attacked when no one expected, giving him and his men an immediate advantage. Of course, Winterfell was also severely undermanned, which is why it ultimately worked out for him (for a little while, anyway).Â 
Â 
4. Shirtless Ramsay fought in close quarters with multiple armed and armored men and didn't take a single injury - super villain mode.Â 
Â 
Not outside the realm of believability, though it does strainÂ plausibility, but I think the fight choreography is more to blame than anything else here. People have survived moreÂ overwhelming odds, in more precarious situations, and suffered few to no injuries as a result.Â 
Â 
All of these points just lead up to one summary: badly done fabricated scene.


Â 
I don't disagree that this whole sequence should have been given more time, as it felt rushed, but I don't see the issues of logic that some people have with the scene or the scenario. For me, it's more a matter of not giving the sequence time to breathe. So while I would definitely rate this as one of the worst sequences the show has done to date, the idea that it's so illogical as to make no sense whatsoever doesn't really ring true. There's criticism, and then there's the kind of complaints we're getting above, which seem to insist that everything must be shown and/or clearly spelled out on-screen to make even a modicum of sense.Â

Â 
Nope, I don't require everything be spelled out in exact detail. I have been fine with most of the fabricated scenes thus far and I'm fine with implying things are happening off screen when it's mostly believable.Â 
Â 
Maybe you're right and it was just that the scene was rushed and not enough details of their escape or Ramsay giving chase were shown. I just do not believe Ramsay would let the dogs go and laugh - and not give chase. They should have shown that at the very least... would have taken another 1 minute of footage at most and the entire episode was 49 minutes long, they had time!
2644	Greywolf2375	2014-05-12	Also, do any one of you realize that Asha's amazing finger-dancing skills have NOT been laid out in the show? So, you're complaining that shirtless Ramsay just obeys to a "badassery quota" for the Unsullied, and instead some of you propose that they should show Asha try her luck finishing Ramsay there and then with a flying axe (badassery quota ad infinitum), when it's not been established that she could actually pull that stunt off.
Â 
Seriously, i'd love a page-by-page TV adaptation, but the book-purism movement need to take a breath and at least not contradict themselves.


Â No one is asking for a page by page, but are asking for scenes to make sense.Â  Since the guard heard the clink of the grappling hook and walked over, then took an axe in the head my take was that she did throw that axe other wise he would have been able to see her without leaning over.
Â 


I'd rather be alone with a serial killer than a large dog. Scare me shitless.


Â Could be true.Â  But then you're also not a fighter in the IronBorn bred for reaving.
Â 


Â 

I don't care if she made something undeniably badass cool. The fact that she stood there watching Ramsay fumble with the lock and didn't even try to do anything is what made it bad. She's an ironborn, made her grand speech, would have probably rather died than flee, and she stood there and did nothing while he messed around as a shirtless man with his guard down took out a key, fumbled with a lock, and had his back towards her.
Â 
Why? Why didn't she do anything? She wasn't in shock to kill armoured men, but she was in too much shock to even attempt to kill a mostly naked man who had his guard completely down? That's not believable that she wouldn't have tried to even do anything except stand there and watch.


Â It's the same issue as last week with Jon & Karl (I think) - where Karl turns his back and just hangs out for a but while Jon comes up behind him.Â  OK, so Yara isn't someone who can throw (even though to me it appears she does a little earlier) - none of them remaining can?Â  Can't remember definitively, but it seemed like her people outnumbered his at that point.Â

Â Sorry but no. The sequence was bad. I would say more, it was embarrassing, laughable, cartoony. And that is a mistake, it spoils the nature of the show.
2646	Cas Stark	2014-05-12	It's extremely improbable that Ramsay could have turned his back like he did to start opening the cage and nobody threw an ax at his head, but maybe the IB were wowed by his shirtless self, since nobody offed him during the close quarters fighting, LOL. Â But, at the very least they could have added a few seconds of showing the dogs careening down a passage way after the IB.

Â 
The Ironborn should have given eachother an "oh crap" look. Hard cut to them escaping accompanied by banjo music.
2648	Cas Stark	2014-05-12	I rewatched the scene and now I'm wondering if that blood on Ramsay is supposed to be the girl's blood, since it doesn't look like any actual cuts, maybe they were going to intersperse him killing her during sex with Asha's approach but cut it after the sept scene debacle.

Â 
Â 
They don't really say, and given Ramsay's nature, it could be either.Â 
Â 
If you see her again later, you'll know the answer was no.
2650	Stormland's Fury	2014-05-12	I rewatched the scene and now I'm wondering if that blood on Ramsay is supposed to be the girl's blood, since it doesn't look like any actual cuts, maybe they were going to intersperse him killing her during sex with Asha's approach but cut it after the sept scene debacle.


Â 
Yeah I assumed that it was Myranda's blood. Things might have gotten out of hand.
2651	Floke	2014-05-12	This has probably been discussed before, but wasn't the Dreadfort supposed to be kind of impregnable? As in "it took the Kings in the North years of siege before the Boltons surrendered" kind of impregnable. I doubt Roose would leave so few men on guard, especially since things in the North still have to cool down.
I didn't like this scene. It felt rushed and pointless. TV watchers wouldn't know to what extent Theon is messed up, alright, but wasn't there really any other way of showing it? Poor Asha's storyline is going to be pretty messed up too now, unless they're going to skip the kingsmoot and just have her ending up around Deepwood Motte next season (they get lost after trying to get back to the Iron Isles by crossing the North on foot?).
The fight scene looked bad, too. It was good to see Asha throwing axes but the rest was a bit ridiculous. Ramsay may be agile and quick with the dagger, but they were basically fighting as if they were in a shield wall (except the Northmen didn't have shield - oh well). The Ironborn waiting for him to open the kennels was simply too much.
And I was really expecting Theon to utter his famous line, for freak's sake! He was there, he had it on the tip of his tongue, "my name is Reek, Reek" and then... nothing.

It just wasn't that believable.


hehe, if they would atack the dogs Ramsay and his men would have gotten even more of the upper hand and kill the IB fast as fuck, if they focus on Ramsay the beast would bite the legs of the iron born thus making them even easier to deal with.
Beasts are a good offense, vicious, dangerous, murdering beasts whom also are expendable.
Â 
the second Ramsay put the key into the lock without the IB interupting him, Ramsay won, basic tactics.
Â 
(I do know what I am talking about as far tactics go.)
Ramsay had 2/3 men left and 2 dogs.
Â 
Sure they could have shot the animals before but since they didn't they lost.
Â 
If Yarasha would for example swing towards the dogs, ramsay could easily run up and put a dagger in her, whilst she landed the swing in the dog, if she ignored the dogs and went for ramsay the beasts would bite her and incapacitate her faster then a dagger would.
(a dogs bite can bite and tear through a leg like nothing at all, does not matter if they have armor.)
A german shepard bites through flesh and bone like a twig, if it wants to, dogs jaws are strong as fuck. ( I also know my fair share of dogs for that matter)
so not only that but 2 dogs equals 2 ironborn who will either become incapacitated or distracted by trying to fend of the dogs.
meaning Ramsay can fucking tear through all of them with the rest of his men like nothing.
Â 
So don't say the dogs would not provve a challenge infact the dogs could be worse then the soldiers themself.

Â 
So don't say the dogs would not provve a challenge infact the dogs could be worse then the soldiers themself.


Â 
Thats not really the sequence problem.
Â 
The problem are others: Ramsay fighting nude against armored and shielded IB; Ramsay slowly showing the key without caring about being stabbed or axed, and the teleport IB scape.
Â 
It was a blatant case of plot armor for both Ramsay and IB. A very badly one BTW, it made the show felt flat and dumb, and an awesome show like GOT deserves more.
2654	Raksha 2014	2014-05-12	hehe, if they would atack the dogs Ramsay and his men would have gotten even more of the upper hand and kill the IB fast as fuck, if they focus on Ramsay the beast would bite the legs of the iron born thus making them even easier to deal with.
Beasts are a good offense, vicious, dangerous, murdering beasts whom also are expendable.
Â 
the second Ramsay put the key into the lock without the IB interupting him, Ramsay won, basic tactics.
Â 
(I do know what I am talking about as far tactics go.)
Ramsay had 2/3 men left and 2 dogs.
Â 
Sure they could have shot the animals before but since they didn't they lost.
Â 
If Yarasha would for example swing towards the dogs, ramsay could easily run up and put a dagger in her, whilst she landed the swing in the dog, if she ignored the dogs and went for ramsay the beasts would bite her and incapacitate her faster then a dagger would.
(a dogs bite can bite and tear through a leg like nothing at all, does not matter if they have armor.)
A german shepard bites through flesh and bone like a twig, if it wants to, dogs jaws are strong as fuck. ( I also know my fair share of dogs for that matter)
so not only that but 2 dogs equals 2 ironborn who will either become incapacitated or distracted by trying to fend of the dogs.
meaning Ramsay can fucking tear through all of them with the rest of his men like nothing.
Â

Â 
Â 
Yes, the unleashed dogs could have caused damage; but Yara and her men had a chance to shoot at the dogs while they were still caged, or shoot Ramsay before he unleashed them, or both; and they just stood still and let Ramsay do his his thing. Â That's what was hard for me to believe.
2655	Crow'sEye	2014-05-12	Why I am guessing, short of meaty material next season, lots of Greyjoy stuff, I hope, an injection of the crazies would be good!

It certainly would.

Â 
I think you missed one of my points entirely. All we got was a rushed cut-scene to Yara and crew leaping in their boats and hightailing it back out to sea ... with dogs barking in the distance. There was NO chance to see if the dogs did or did not turn the tide of the battle in either side's favor. As far as we know Ramsay just threatened to open the cages Â but didn't since everyone's intact with all their limbs getting into the boats and the dogs apparently weren't very fast...
Â 
Just poorly done.

Â 
Yep-- if they had to do this scene, *this* is where Locke should've died, imho. Not beyond the Wall. That also felt odd and anticlimactic.
Â 
If Locke was at the Dreadfort with some small garrison force, then surprised by Ironborn and killed after revealing that Theon was long gone, having left with Ramsay... that would make a little more sense to me and seem less contrived.

That's genius. Ramsay could even already be on his way to Moat Cailin.
2660	Crow'sEye	2014-05-12	The scene with Yara shows the audience that ...
Â 
.... theon was not playacting, he really is Reek now.
Â 
.... theon will now do Ramsay's bidding in good faith, the viewers need not expect any tricks from him
Â 
.... Yara has no more reason to plan any more rescue attempts, her brother is dead to her.
Â 
Â 
I am really growing sick and tired of all the folks bleating "Hey I don't understand this, it must be, like, useless filler!!1!!1" over and over again.
Â 
Also, the blood on ramsay's body show that the Ironborn were fighting throughout the castle, if he had backed them into a corner and fought them to the death his own casualties would have been too great. He was therefore content to let yara go, and she was content to leve herself as she could clearly see her brother existed no more.


"One cries because one is sad. For example, I cry because others are stupid, and that makes me sad."
2661	Crow'sEye	2014-05-12	Â 
I was just thinking that exact same thing. Â And wasn't the Hound's speech to her just the previous week?


There was foreshadowing in Ep1. Oberyn states that in enclosed (or close, not sure) quarters a small blade is better. We then see Karl and two knives play with Jon Snow and his Valyarian blade, and then Ramsay and two little blades easily handle the Ironborn and their large axes.

Â 
I don't demand that everything follow the book, but there are scenes that I love to see brought to life on the series....Â Â  art of the novel come to life on screen.....blah blah....etc
Â 
The scene were theon recognizes his sister but she does not recognize him in contrast to earlier introduction of the characters seems like a missed opportunity.
Â 
Writers need to be better when they stray otherwise it does become fodder for mockery.Â Â  It was out of HBO Asha's character to care enough to rescue theon after warning him at Winterfell.Â Â  At least at this point of the plot anyway.Â Â  More so it would be out of Asha's character to go all the way and not get the job done because theon bit her arm and cause of a few dogs
Â 
Phooey!!!

Not sure if you're trolling or actually trying to make a point, but having believable and realistic character-driven drama in a medieval fantasy world is exactly what makes (made) the show so compelling. Â He's talking about the plot, you're talking about the setting.
Â 
In other words, he's talking about something relevant and you're "answering" with something completely irrelevant. Â Not exactly a valuable contribution to the conversation...


Â 
I was merely making a joke, but I guess that Â could be considered trolling. Even discounting the dragons and magic, the tv series has been iffy about "realism." Like Theon getting a close encounter with a morning star in S3, or the whole bear pit segment. "What happened to realism?" A better answer than what I gave would be that realism in the series has been a problem before this dreadfort scene, only now it's much more awful. Instead of a small thing here or there, it was an entire segment that was awful from both a book standpoint and staging.Â

Â 
Oh that morning star made me cringe too. But yeah, the show is gritty and realistic in context but sometimes they slip up on purpose to enhance drama I guess. Same with the Hound knocking out Arya after the RW, she probably would have a concussion.
2667	of man and wolf	2014-05-12	After thinking about it today, I cant help but think it was kinda dumb for Asha to just leave Theon there, without much of a fight after Ramsay threatened her with unleashing the dogs. I get Theon was totally broken, I get she might not want to risk further death of her own men to save someone who is clearly "gone" or no longer the same man she once knew, but that is still her brother, that is her blood. Family. I could never leave a sibling behind to go through more torture and degrading treatment. The thoughts in my head wondering what was happening at any time of day to my sibling or lovbed one would drive me mad and up the walls. She should have fought harder for him, or at the least given her all to get at the man who did this to him. He's right there and basically laughing at you and not caring at all about what he's done to her brother. And she flees. She came off pathetic. If you wont die for your own family, what's the point of going on?
2668	King Tommen	2014-05-12	It was always going to be the issue with this storyline if all they wanted to do was find something for Yara to do this season. The status quo had to be maintained meaning Theon could not be rescued, Ramsay would not be defeated and Yara would have to somehow be allowed to escape.Â  Any way you write around it, you need to end up with this result so it's going to come off unsatisfying in some form or another no matter what choices you make.

That's why I said that the only way this arc would make any sense is if they were ready to truly deviate and have Yara be captured in the attack (which is really what logic dictates would happen in this scenario). That way, it would have allowed her to be entered into Theon's story far earlier than she does in the book and allows for another dynamic to be introduced into the Ramsay/Theon interactions for the next season or so.

But they didn't want to alter the book narrative to that degree so everything has to be more or less reset which means you need to put on your suspension of belief glasses on to allow for the story to play out that way.
Â 
For some, the silver lining should be that it's now much more likely the Kingsmoot plays out fairly closely to the books in S5. Because of Yara's excursion, she won't even be in Pyke when Balon dies so there's even more accuracy for you.
2669	Crow'sEye	2014-05-12	I'll be expecting Vic/Euron mentions in the episode with Kenning.

Â 
It's really weird that the Greyjoy brothers haven't gotten a shout out yet, apart from season 1.
2671	Hath4	2014-05-12	to me there were two points they were trying to acomplishÂ  with the attack on the dreadfort. one was to show once and for all that theon is completly reek and complety in the grasp of Ramsay. Second was to better flesh out yara for her storyline with the Greyjoy Uncles next season. I think ateast on those two points it was succesful, but there was no dought that this scene should have been better and more logical.
2672	JesterX	2014-05-12	Can somebody tell me what Ramsay said just before he went to open the dog cages?Â  I've replayed that scene a few times but I can't make it out.
2673	of man and wolf	2014-05-12	Did anyone notice Ramsay's scene was shortened? In the trailer Myranda slaps him. I think this and whatever resulted in those cuts on him was removed from the episode. Did they kill her off screen? She probably had more screen time this year than some actual important characters.


I have a feeling this was the scene that was too gruesome to show or something and they edited it out, which is also why this show was only 49 minutes, which feels like a rip-off.
2674	King Tommen	2014-05-12	There could be multiple reasons for cutting a scene of Myranda dying. The "gruesome" scene that needed to be edited down has already taken place (it's probably Jon skewering Karl at Craster's Keep) because the director and DP that brought it up in the interview only worked on episodes 4 and 5.
Â 
However, it's possible that a reason the death was cut was because of all the attention the "sexual violence to females" narrative had gained in the media earlier in the season. Knowing that Myranda is basically a disposable character they could kill (or not kill) offscreen and never speak of again, a determination could have been made recently to just exclude that sequence so that they didn't have another female being used sexually and having something violent happen to her.
Â 
But then again, the scene may have been cut for reasons that have nothing to do with that. We may never know.

Â 
I suspect there was some serious fallout from the Cersei rape scene at play with some editing here that may be causing the episode to have been shortened as well. Of all the things the show has done graphically and sexually, it really surprised me how freaked out everyone got about the Cersei / Jaime Sept scene. I mean c'mon no one freaked out that much about what Joffrey did to Ros and those other 'whores' - but that's somehow different?
Â 
Apparently viewers are more sensitive this season and so they may have toned down sexually violent scenes hence why we do not see what happened with Myranda.
2676	Cas Stark	2014-05-12	I agree. Â They cut a scene of Ramsay killing her...and it left the show short several minutes...as a result of fallout from the sept scene.
2677	Crow'sEye	2014-05-12	Hopefully it'll be in the boxset then.
A pox on those projecting their nonsense on the show.
2678	Hath4	2014-05-12	Well we already saw him hunt and kill an inoccent girl (poor tansy) eailer so it has already been estanblished that girls at the dreadfort are being used for ramsays sadism, so from a narrative standpoint it might have felt repetive and gratuitos, plus myranda unlike tansy was a pycho herself, so there would not have been much sympathy for her demise.

The scene wasn't done well, but it did a few things. They need to show the Reek transformation and give screen time to the Bolton's and Asha. The show runners have done a great job correcting all of Martin's errors. 
It's going to be tough to not lose the audience soon. The source material gets really weak. Hopefully, Arya and Jon can keep people interested during the couple seasons where nothing really happens. I can see the audience quitting simply because they grow tired of Dany's story going nowhere. D and D have their work cut out for them.

Â 
Yeah what it did was great. the lead up is almost unforgivable, but alas, I never much cared for the Reek/Bolton/Ironborn story line in the books anyway. I'm just rather annoyed that this five minutes is going to be seen as dragging down the rest of a superb episode.Â

Â 
Actually, it would be my contention that Myranda was killed by random Ironborn storming Ramsay's room as part of the raid which is why her blood would be on Ramsay as they were both in bed.
Â 
The way they cut the scene, Yara and the Ironborn making it over the walls and taking out the guards there was still while Ramsay was having sex with Myranda because you can hear them in the background, which also means Ramsay's room was nearby. I think there was another scene after Yara takes the guard by knifepoint who tells them where Theon is where it cuts back to Myranda and Ramsay in the bedroom who finally hear the commotion outside (possibly right after her little slap to him we see in the trailers). Then 1 or 2 Ironborn crash into the room, kill Myranda before Ramsay kills them and rushes out which is why he's got her blood on him and doesn't have time to throw on a shirt.Â  Then the next scene would be Yara making it into the kennels as we saw.
Â 
There's a sequence missing there certainly and we don't know what happened exactly but we know there was more of Myranda and Ramsay that wasn't shown.
2690	Hath4	2014-05-12	That's possible but how would ramsay possibly survive if myranda was killed right on top of him in the bed, he would be a sitting duck in the bed.

Again, it's not 2 dogs, it's a kennel full. I have no idea why you keep saying this. And we got a glimpse of what the hounds could do in E2. Not sure if you having a sword helps all that much.
Â 
I'm going to sail half way round Westeros to save my brother who presumably wants to be saved. Once I heartbreakingly realize that he is a lost cause and can no longer even identify himself as Theon, then yeah, it's time to go....
Â 
How else did you see this playing out???
Â 
I think it's pretty obvious that if Theon wanted to be rescued, then Yara would have fought to the death to save him, dogs or no dogs. She realized the mission was a failure when he scampered back into his cage like a broken man. That's not who she came to save.

Yara had ample time to pitch an ax at Ramsay as he held up his key for dramatic affect and turned slowly to jingle with the lock. The dogs might have put up a good fight if they were released, but if Yara had any brains she would've just killed Ramsay right there. So still, that scene is idiotic.Â
2701	Misnthropia	2014-05-12	All this scene needed was some Benny Hill music playing as the Ironborn ran from some dogs. Then Asha getting bitten on the arse and her jumping into the air. Wouldve been a fitting end to such a joke of a scene.
Â 
50 of the greatest fighters from the Iron Islands, take the Dreadfort by surprise and theyre defeated by dogs? Oh yeaah please tell me more about how the Greyjoys are a threat to anything other than kittens. Youve got a damn sword. Im fairly sure a swords reach extends further than the jaws of a dog.
Â 
I dont see why they included it to be honest, we already know Theon is completely broken, we saw that from the scene with Locke and Roose. The Boltons have got some pretty decent screentime for a lesser house and they will be getting more as they draw closer to Winterfell and Moat Cailin.
Â 
If the objective here was to given the Greyjoys some screen time, ive got an event that could take place that gives them something to do. Its called the Kingsmoot.

					
					
							Edited by Misnthropia, 12 May 2014 - 09:32 PM.
2702	CaptainTheo	2014-05-12	My immediate reaction to watching this scene was that Yara said that Theon was dead because she was disgusted with him and gave up on him. And I was critical of Reek for not joining her.
Â 
But after re-watching the scene, thinking about it and reading comments, I have to change my mind. Firstly, Yara was still demanding the release of her brother at the end of the scene with Ramsay, even after he'd bitten her and retreated into her cage. It was only when Ramsay produced the key to let the dogs out that she changed her mind. Therefore, Yara really fled because she was scared of a couple of dogs. This makes her appear as more than a little cowardly, and arguably disloyal as well to abandon her brother so quickly. She could have had a bit of sympathy for him, knowing what he's been through (castration, for one). Stating that he was dead was a lie and an excuse to run away.
Â 
It also seems really silly that she spent all that time travelling across half of Westeros to reach the Dreadfort, and when she gets there she immediately throws in the towel and turns around, wasting all of that time and resources.

Thank you.
And for everyone else, it's not like I don't understand the scene-thanks for the clarification even if I do find it mildly insulting.
The Ep was short, they for some reason cut the Oberyn reveal off the end and they wasted time at the dread fort they could have used at the iron islands with Victarion, Yara and Balon talking about Euron to set their storyline up.
There was a lot of ways to show theon is dead and reek is alive.
This way, I feel, was a waste of budget.

Â 
He knows he's Theon, he just would rather sleep with dogs, be covered with poo, eat bugs and grovel than stand up and die with dignity.

I don't think you can brainwash a mind to forget like that, and it wouldn't work with others.Â
2705	PhoenixFlame	2014-05-12	The problem with Theon is that he's just too much of a coward, and Ramsay told his sister exactly that.
Â 
He knows he's Theon, he just would rather sleep with dogs, be covered with poo, eat bugs and grovel than stand up and die with dignity.

Ehm, read up on torture/hostage victims. Virtually anyone breaks with enough psychological reinforcement and pain, combined with acts of "kindness" like food (or a bath). It's partially tied to the hostage, despite their pain, being dependent on the torturer for survival and human interaction. And Stockholm Syndrome was named after victims of a bank hostage situation who offered to pay for the robbers' lawyers.
Â 
Theon's lack of personal identity--the result of being raised a hostage--certainly contributed, but the question of his cravenness is answered at the end of ADWD. Â

Maybe the bank robber explained to them his situation and they sympathized?Â

Anyway, I am not going to argue against what you're saying, I just can't see this happening to Sandor for example. Daenerys maybe, even Ramsay himself, but Sandor or Bronn? No. Just no.Â

Â 
Sandor is an emotionally crippled man. He doesnt show it but deep down he has huge emotional problems, this is why he helps Sansa and Arya, but makes it out to be a hostage situation. Im sure if you knew anything about his childhood you could get him to snap pretty quickly.

2709	Ser Irvine	2014-05-12	It's the dumbest fucking scene so far I think...



I thought it was the best next to Stannis/Davos & certain parts of the trial. Allow me to explain.Â 
Those people freaking out about the Iron Born not putting up more of a fight, you do to realize they were in the bowels of the Dreadfort do you not? One of the strongest and certainly the most feared northern keeps second only to Winterfell? Rivaled only by Karhold (Now first considering Winterfells status) 50 of the best Iron born killers or not they would have been slaughtered and/or captured/flayed given another minute. Even Ramsay and his few men dominated the heavily armed Iron born in that clash and if you noticed only Yara did any real killing before she realized she was completely screwed. She does however have "big balls" to suggest that Ramsay surrender when she herself is defeated.
The hounds were just Ramsay's way of having a little fun. I'd personally bet the Bolton's bastard could have taken her one on one the way he made short work of her best men (Who said Ramsay was untested?). Ramsay & the Boltons don't get enough credit on this show by the fans. This Ramsay is a far more interesting and logistically more powerful then the one shown in the books who's just a crazed animal rivaled only by Gregor Clegane. Bolton's with the Frey's behind them and the blessing of Kings Landing are the strongest force in the TV Westeros right now although Stannis with the Iron Bank behind him might be the only thing capable of eclipsing that. The Greyjoy's are plucky-to-the-end losers overall. Sure they fight well, just not well enough to stand toe to toe with the big boys. Baratheon, Bolton, Frey, Lannister, Stark (in memoriam), Tyrell. These are the big boys. The Iron Born should indeed return to their "shit stained rocks" and raid fishing villages LOL

He has no sense of self. He has no idea who he is.

The family that raised him, was his real family and it was only when he was strung up did he realise that Robb was his brother. Of course he had emotional issues. Ramsay played on that, the whole trip through the woods telling him he was free, he was going to see his sister. Only to wind up back in a cage and told his father knew of his imprisonment.
Â 
Ramsay is an expert torturer, like any form of torture once you find the crack in the armor you attack and attack.
Â 
Someone like Sandor has major cracks in his armor. His sister was murdered presumably at the hands of the Mountain and his faced was shoved in the fire. He feels responsible for the girls he protects like his sister.
Â 
You clearly have no grasp on torture nor the inner workings of the charachters if you think Theon cracked because hes a coward and Sandor Clegane is a rock.

2711	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-05-12	I've seen lots of non-readers complaining not only about this particular episode, but about the whole Dreadfort/Ironborn storyline. I think the showrunners should re-evaluate their approach to this segment for next season, because I do think something there is a bit off, especially for non-readers
2712	Anarchosaurus Rex	2014-05-13	More evidence that the showrunners have no idea what they are doing, or that the target demographic is idiotic. Probably a little of both.
Â 
First of all, this was the climax of a mission from last season? Asha rounds up her most badass warriors to go kick ass and chew bubblegum, and they get beaten by a pack of dogs? Theon took Winterfell with a bunch of Ironborn rejects. Seemed anticlimactic and pointless to me.
Â 
Also, her whole speech was wrong. The Ironborn don't give a damn about "your prince...YOUR PRINCE." Ironborn follow strength, not titles. Theon means nothing to them.
Â 
Oh, and Ramsay and "Myranda"? Sure, D&D has Jaime, the anti-hero on the redemption arc, do the raping, and Ramsay, a depraved monster, having hot sex with a willing bedwarmer. Keep up the good work, y'all!

2713	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-05-13	Well, yeah, the entire rescue mission was awful, but I do think the showrunners at least learned a bit from their mistakes last season because they are giving the Boltons and the Dreadfort much less screentime this time, unlike last season when every two episodes was Theon turture.
Â 
But then again, I also think (and I may be overreacting, but whatever) that the Greyjoys as a whole lost about half of their appeal since season 2 when they changed the character of Asha for the worse
Â 
Like, Theon himself says it in his POV in aCoK. The Iron Islands are a grim and shitty place, but Asha was about the only witty and entertaining person in there
2714	Koi No Yokan	2014-05-13	Really, it just felt like the entire arc needed to bridge the gaps to make it feel much more cohesive and desperate. The way Ramsay/Myranda and the Ironborn scenes were interlocking, I was waiting for the ball to drop with Ramsay killing Myranda (or someone coming in to kill her in the act). They really missed something to indicate why Ramsay was still shirtless and covered in blood.
Â 
Then there certainly needed to be something else after Ramsay began to release the hounds, to show us just how dire the situation is for the Ironborn. No doubt the full might of the Dreadfort was about to rain down on them, but it definitely could have been fleshed out better than "Ramsay pulls out key, cut to Ironborn fleeing outside".
Â 
I liked the idea of the scene, and I liked the beginning and aftermath result with Theon; just thought the execution was poor. Very rushed and disjointed.
Â 
At least Asha will be back in time for the Kingsmoot, it seems.

Keep up the good work, y'all! well let's be honest here the two are not comparable, myranda is there willingly because she is as psychotic and sadistic as ramsay. she like him enjoys sadism.

Â 
Well fortunately next season they'll actually be using ADWD so there'll be a proper plot. Imo they should have bought some of that forwards to S4. They could have introduced Jeyne as a fellow prisoner in S3, and had the first part of Theon's Dance chapters in S4, ending with Ramsay's marriage to Jeyne.

Â 
My opinion still stands. Even if they had the same past theoritically, but were the same men they were today, Sandor would not crack.Â 
Â 
They are different men, Theon is a coward and Sandor is a beast.Â 
Â 
Again, just from what the show has shown us and not the books.Â
2718	Pablosplinter	2014-05-13	I thought the whole scene was embarrassing in pretty much every way tbh. Shame, as the rest of the episode was pretty good.

Â 
I'm curious, what is the problem the non book readers saw with the scene?
2720	Conchobar	2014-05-13	So then they probably added the sound of battle into it post production to make it look like the blood was from men he had killed rather than Myranda?

Â 
Kingpin,
As to your views on Sandor and Theon, Â I would remind you that one of the major themes in this story is "things may not be as they seem". Â Keep that in mind here... as with any story that is only about 1/3 told.Â 
Â 
Also remember, Sandor didn't "Stand up and die like a man" at the Blackwater. Â  He turned tail, forswore his holy vow, and ran.... Now he has a 10 year old girl hostage and plans to sell her to distant cousins.Â
2722	Hath4	2014-05-13	The problem with the theory that ramsay killed some ironborn on his way to the kennels is, the other men he was with did not look like they had engaged in any combat. it really is somewhat confusing.
2723	Cas Stark	2014-05-13	So then they probably added the sound of battle into it post production to make it look like the blood was from men he had killed rather than Myranda?


Â 
When I rewatched the episode, the blood on Ramsay looked more like it was "on" him, not his own blood, even though it's diagonal, like possibly scratches? Or else someone did a really bad job w/the make up because it didn't look deep enough to be even shallow sword wounds. Â And how in the hell would he get a bunch of super shallow cuts anyway from people with axes, swords and shields?

Â 
Yeah sure, I just can't see it up to now.Â 
Â 
The difference is Sandor didn't give a shit, he said "fuck the king" in front of the guard and left. Â That doesn't mean he's a coward, but that he looks after his own hide. I never said he's an honest or a good man, just that he is walking on a very solid ground, right or wrong, and can't be manipulated by Ramsay.Â 
Â 
I think he's "above him" in a way. A 10 year old wouldn't be able to manipulate you for instance.Â 
Â

Â 
I agree with the first point you made, but not about Sandor at Blackwater. It just shows that Sandor cracked, first of all Sandor only has one fear, fire. And being the amount of fire that was at Blackwater you could see why it could take a man with a deep ingrained fear of it, over the edge. Second, Sandor litterately doesn't give a shit about knights and there vows, infact he hates them, all Sandor see when he see a knight is a killer, nothing more nothing less. The fact that his big brother is a knight even enforces this hate even more, he knows what the Mountain is about and is disgusted by the fact any one can call knights honourable. Third, he simple had enough of the Lannisters especially Joffery. A boy king who treats him like a dog of his title; The Hound. Whats more this boy tortures a naive little girl who dreams about knights in shining armour, who has lost her family, he also didn't just ran away, he asked Sansa to come with him, she says no. So Sandor couldn't even be a "knight in shining armour" to a girl who still believes in them. What did Sandor have left in King's Landing?
Â 
I also wouldn't call Arya a hostage. Sandor may shout, threaten and warn her, but he has never hit her (sadly he did hit her in the show and stole from a little girls father  ), never let harm come to her and after all the Lannisters are looking for her to lock her up in a tower with her sister. In a war torn land. Now am not saying he perfect by any means (who is?), but he is imo one of the closet things toÂ  an actual "story book knight" in the books. Just he isn't beautiful, isn't even a knight and no one would even think of him in that light in aSoIaF.
Â 
Honestly, Sandor has been one of my most hated things I hate about this show.

					
					
							Edited by Yojimbo, 13 May 2014 - 03:09 PM.
2726	Raffles	2014-05-13	The problem with Yara in this scene is this;
Â 
1) She knew Theon was a lost cause - fine.
2) She had only a handful of men with her at the end - fine.
Â 
but...
Â 
3) A poor soldier such as Ramsay didn't get harmed, despite having no armour on - not cool.
4) Yara and her men held the upper hand at the end of the scene and didn't kill Ramsay - not cool.
5) They just stood there and gawped whilst Ramsay made his "Release the hounds.." threat - not cool.
So, overall, we appreciate that the Theon/Reek situation was being clarified even more (despite the later bath scene proving to be more than adequate imo), but it's the fact the Ramsay was allowed to fight with no armour on (and not get a scratch mind you.. not even a fucking nick) despite being in close quarters to some of the most ruthless Ironborn Yara had at her disposal (real tough men.. not squeamish amateurs caught out of their depth).. this is the issue. Yara would've fought tooth and nail, not stood there gawping as Ramsay monologued without a care in the world... the mere threat of him releasing the hounds should have required her immediate attention in dispatching Ramsay asap.. but no.. he was allowed to spend plenty of time talking up his threat.
Â 
The only thing missing from this scene was some good old Benny Hill music. This is, without a doubt in my mind, the worst scene in GoT that I've seen so far. There's no excuse for it. I'm just going to trawl the internet now and see what the tv critics said about it. I'm guessing their words won't be pretty..

2727	Lord Thornhart	2014-05-13	Overall, this was clearly something that shouldn't have been left on a cliffhanger for half a year.
2728	Wunhopkuendo	2014-05-13	I also felt that the scene was clumsy at best and just not good, but I'm willing to let it slide as I feel that this hasn't been the case for the majority of the show thus far. And the Theon scene after was just awesome. Theon really did look like a little abused puppy dog when he was afraid to look Ramsey in the eye and kept dropping his head every time he looked up. Just superb acting right there. Some of the best in the series so far.
2729	Ruin	2014-05-13	I'm not a fan of this plotline, and it would have been better just introducing Euron and/or Victarion, or just having Aeron drown a Maester.

Â 
Yeah, I've come to this same conclusion and am ready to stop arguing about the scene's obvious lack of sense and believable bits that have now been beaten more than Theon was beaten, hehe. I think we all just need to let it go (queue Frozen song).
Â 
But seriously - you're right. Alfie Allen's amazing performance carried the scene and made it worthwhile even if I didn't like the short chopped up way they handled the Ironborn 'invasion' (more like a kid's paintball confrontation). I've re-watched the scene and now appreciate it ONLY for the fact that Alfie's incredible performance made his total transformation into Reek once and for all concrete and real. No more speculation if Theon is just 'acting' the part of Reek and biding his time for the right moment to kill Ramsay - nope. It's obvious he's totally 100% gone.
2731	I'll pay the iron price	2014-05-13	Not a bad scene.
Yara saw Theon but realised he was a lost cause - if she had dragged him back to Pyke then Balon would have taken one look at him and probably thrown him into the sea himself.
Â 
I was hoping that big dude with the blackbeard that the camera focused on at the end of season 3 would have had a role (Yara's own Luca Brasi)
All in all the Dreadfort scene could have been better but it didnt suck either.

I guess he was out on a trip with the wife.

Then he comes home and Ramsay gets in shit:
Â 
"We leave the house for a weekend, and behind our backs you have a party and wreck the place."
"But dad, those Ironborn weren't even invited !"
"I told you no parties, you irresponsible brat. And don't think I didn't find out that you had some girl in my bed - parts of her are still in there."
"But dad ..."Â 
"No buts. You and Reek are grounded. You're going to clean this place up by ADWD, or no trip to Winterfell for you."
" Fascist."
"What was that, boy?"
"Nothing." Â

2743	Wunhopkuendo	2014-05-13	The dreadfort is probably pretty large. I imagine Roose would have been about as far away from the dungeons/kennels as possible in his cozy lord's chambers, whereas that psycho Ramsey enjoys doing it with chicks in the weirdest places, which is why he was able to get there so quickly. As for the whole sneak attack, I have decided that in my mind Yara sneaks in with a handful of ironborn, while the rest are split into diversion and escape duties. He plan is to get in and get out with Theon and have a small army to help her escape. It doesn't go as well as planned (especially since Theon was in the kennels and not dungeon) and seeing Theon's state, she is forced to escape while she can.
Â 
As for Theon being not skinny enough, that's book Theon not show Theon. Just because Ramsey in the show is flaying and torturing Theon, doesn't mean he wants to starve him. He is treating him like a dog, probably feeding him leftover table scraps and chunks of meat.

Do you really think they had seconds to spare to squeeze Roose in there? The schedule was already full with that riveting Ironborn escape.


Â 
Well just prior to the bath scene perhaps a quick Roose/Ramsay scene.
Roose says "Get on with the Moat Caillin job"
2746	aFeastForDragons	2014-05-13	If Asha was there she would have put an axe into Ramsey's head and dragged Theon back to her ship.

Stupid scene but still very enjoyable.

If Ramsey is able to cut through seasoned Iron Born topless then he could take both Barristan and Loras Tyrell in full plate.

Yeah sure, I just can't see it up to now.Â 
Â 
The difference is Sandor didn't give a shit, he said "fuck the king" in front of the guard and left. Â That doesn't mean he's a coward, but that he looks after his own hide. I never said he's an honest or a good man, just that he is walking on a very solid ground, right or wrong, and can't be manipulated by Ramsay.Â 
Â 
I think he's "above him" in a way. A 10 year old wouldn't be able to manipulate you for instance.Â 


Â 
But WHY did he storm off during the Blackwater? He was afraid of the flames. He cracked.
Â 


Overall, this was clearly something that shouldn't have been left on a cliffhanger for half a year.


Â 
I agree. We saw Asha starting her Dreadfort plan what? later half of last season? To have to culminate in a 2 minute botched scene a year later is an insult really.

Â 
In the very last episode, near the end. And that was all the resolution we got.
2750	The Abominable SnowOther	2014-05-13	That Yara chick ain't got shit on Asha.
Asha would have thrown her fucking axe at Ramsay's face for giving her his back...
2751	Kaspiro	2014-05-13	Well, after all this speculation, I have to say that was incredibly disappointing. I understand that without a willingness by the writers to deviate from the books, the scene becoming filler was essentially inevitable. As I said in my original post, if Ramsay, Asha/Yara and Theon must survive the encounter there are few possible outcomes, and even fewer if the writers are not willing to allow Theon to escape or Asha to be captured. That said, I was surprised in that I was genuinely expecting a book deviation, (my original guess was that Theon was freed and remained free just long enough to go to Moat Cailin and treat with the ironborn in earnest before he and Asha were captured by Stannis, effectively rejoining their storylines with those of their book counterparts). If they weren't planning anything to come of it, why initiate the storyline in the finale of season 3 at all? Why build all that hype to come to an abrupt halt a year afterwards? I'll admit that the scene did a fair job showing the final result of Theon's psychological conditioning, but that could have easily been accomplished in other scenes and the end of such a built-up storyline deserved more. As it is the entire thing (save Theon's scene) Â just comes off as time-killing filler.Â 
Â 
And even after accepting that the scene was filler, it still seemed lazier and more contradictory to Asha/Yara's character than it had to be. If they had to provide a resolution, could it not at least have made sense? Ramsay came without a shirt, and took many long moments delivering speeches wherein he was vulnerable. Yet Yara did absolutely nothing. Asha of the books, if she truly wanted to free her brother as Yara did, would have avenged him even if he was not willing to escape. The whole thing felt cheap and useless. I enjoyed the scenes that came afterwards, and the acting during the scene, but the entire scenario was hilariously bad.Â 
Â 
After this, I'm not sure I'll be using 'Asha/Yara' to denote Theon's sister again. They've begun to seem like different people.Â

2754	boojam	2014-05-13	When I rewatched the episode, the blood on Ramsay looked more like it was "on" him, not his own blood, even though it's diagonal, like possibly scratches? Or else someone did a really bad job w/the make up because it didn't look deep enough to be even shallow sword wounds. Â And how in the hell would he get a bunch of super shallow cuts anyway from people with axes, swords and shields?What the hell was that all about , I thought at first those were 'love scratches' , and maybe have been, we missing a scene they took out, like last week!The CONTROVERSY and all you know?Downright weird!
2755	boojam	2014-05-13	I thought it was the best next to Stannis/Davos & certain parts of the trial. Allow me to explain.Â Those people freaking out about the Iron Born not putting up more of a fight, you do to realize they were in the bowels of the Dreadfort do you not? One of the strongest and certainly the most feared northern keeps second only to Winterfell? Rivaled only by Karhold (Now first considering Winterfells status) 50 of the best Iron born killers or not they would have been slaughtered and/or captured/flayed given another minute. Even Ramsay and his few men dominated the heavily armed Iron born in that clash and if you noticed only Yara did any real killing before she realized she was completely screwed. She does however have "big balls" to suggest that Ramsay surrender when she herself is defeated.Not the way I saw it.Yara/Asha had , seemingly only 5 Ironborn brawlers with her, she loses two, looked like to me that Ramsay lost all his men.I counted three guys that Yara killed.I also got the impression that Yara and her guys were not a-skered of the dogs, she just left in disgust.Why did the Ironborn lose any fighters at all?And where were all those 45 other mean-as-hell Ironborn warriors?

2758	Gran de Lys	2014-05-13	Okay, so, after wading through every post on this thread, here's my thought. This scene was not about Asha/Yara. We keep circling around it--it's a test for Theon! No, the test was the shaving scene! But he was half-lying/sparing his skin in the shaving scene! And we never get to the denouement, where Ramsay entrusts his Reek to go forth and be Theon.
Â 
The whole Asha invades the Dreadfort thing was the real test--Reek proving that he's Reek in his heart and soul, so that Ramsay can finally trust him to be Theon again. If he won't admit who he is and allow himself to be rescued and get safe--to his own sister--then he has truly been broken. That's what Ramsay needed to hear in order to send him to Moat Cailin as the cringing slave impersonating Theon Greyjoy, thus bringing the boy back to himself. What Ramsay's endgame is in letting Reek be Theon again, I'm not clear on, but I believe this scene was all to get to that moment.
Â 
Continue hatin' on the scene. I have a half-pint of Ben & Jerry's waiting.

Â 
As someone who actually served in the real special forces, I do think I have an idea of what I am talking about. The whole point of the comparison is that you can spend a month in preparation and have every possible variable planned out, and then still have something come up that scraps the whole mission. I have seen it happen in real life far more times than I can or will recall to you.
Â 
The Yara plan most likely hinged on a quick assault of the dungeons with a rescue of an imprisoned Theon willing to escape with her. The wrench thrown in to the mix was that Theon was actually in the kennels and so brainwashed as to believe it was all a trick brought on by Ramsey. So the mission probably took longer than anticipated due to having to relocate Theon and then was pushed to failure status when he wouldn't come and the bells gave away the element of surprise.

2770	Lord Thornhart	2014-05-14	So is anyone else predicting a huge loss in fans for Yara? Seems like they wanted to get her out of there so soon that they didn't realize what an asshole she looked like writing her brother off as dead in less than two minutes. The actress is pretty bad, and the character's wild personality hasn't been very apparent. Her only interesting trait was that she cared about Theon, and that just got thrown out the window. I can't see a reason why anyone would like Yara (not Asha) anymore.

I don't think so, given that she actually went out of her way to rescue him. I've only seen the Unsullied saying positive things about her. Most of them think Theon is beyond repair as well.

Â 
Sadly, Asha will never exist in the show. Yara is a completely different character and doesn't live up to the cool attitude and fighting prowess of Asha. While I understand they've made her a more sympathetic character in the show (book Asha never would have risked everything to try and get Theon out of there) it's not really even that which makes her a lesser character. It's that they've left out how good she was at everything she did - she commanded ships, and men and was a helluva fighter herself. Yara is a pale shadow of any of those things. So if show-only viewers were "Yara" fans I don't know why really other than her trying to rescue Theon. Book readers will still be "Asha" fans because the two are nothing alike and we prefer GRRM's portrayal and simply deny Yara.
2773	acosta	2014-05-14	I never cared an iota about Asha until the Kingsmoot anyway, and if they actually do show that and don't just have Euron inherit the crown, that'll be her make or break moment, not this.Â 
Â 
But yes, this made her look retarded. That was definitely a several month trip. Since she left, Stannis has burned heretics, raised a small army, and gone to Braavos. Jon has returned to Castle Black, attacked Craster's Keep, and returned to Castle Black again. Dany has conquered another city and installed herself as queen. Theon has gone from initially refusing to call himself Reek to full-on, straight-up Reek. They were on a boat for a long time and she took all of two minutes to change her mind, turn around, and spend another few months on a boat.Â
2774	DaveyJoe	2014-05-15	I seriously don't miss the axe twirling cartoon character from the books, I think Gemma Whelan is doing a fine job. Â At the end of the day, Theon is the more established and important character, and the Dreadfort scene was about him.
2775	Crow'sEye	2014-05-15	The description of the journey was a mistake. Seems the best (and Viking way) was to go up the Fever or Saltspear and yomp it (maybe with skiffs) across land. A much shorter journey.
Maybe they thought saying going across the whole continent scanned better?
2776	I'll pay the iron price	2014-05-15	From a Ramsay point of view - perhaps the Lady Hornwood angle would have been a better storyline but HBO needed something for Yara to do this season.
2777	Stormland's Fury	2014-05-15	Why did she absolutely have to attack the Dreadfort by sea anyway? The IB occupy the North and she only had a relatively small force meant as rescue squad that has to traverse enemy territory. In the end they just sneak into the Dreadfort either way.

2778	1000AcresAndAHoldfast	2014-05-15	I thought this was a bit of a pointless and unnecessary scene just to give an excuse for Yara and Ramsay to have some more screen time. It also ruins the dramatic family reunion in the snow we would have got much later on in the narrative. I find it unlikely that a rabble of Ironborn would have been able to scale the walls of the Dreadfort, fail in an attempt to rescue Reek and then escape with their skins intact to their row-boat. Budget restrictions play a part but the Dreadfort is hardly going to be garrisoned by a dozen men like it seemed in this episode. they would have been easily cut down within sight of the walls as they tried to fleeÂ

Â 
Â 
This is true for me. I disliked her for basically having shot down Theon's far superior idea for an alliance basically because she felt threatened, goaded him into his desperate behavior, and then blamed him for it.
It is only around / after the Kingsmoot that she owns up to her having been petty and foolish (and her father as well).
2781	Crow'sEye	2014-05-16	I don't think this meeting ruins the reunion at a later date. I think it makes it more interesting.
2782	boojam	2014-05-16	I don't think this meeting ruins the reunion at a later date. I think it makes it more interesting.I agree, since if they follow through Theon undergoes even more depredation , we will see if they change his physical appearance , if that meeting takes place.
2783	boojam	2014-05-16	Just to note.This whole Yara/Asha thing played out, awkwardly , as I imagined it would ... show runners wanted to other Greyjoy from fading from non-readers memories so a rather contrived story was cooked up.It did serve to add some motivation to Yara's seeking the Iron King (Queen this out be!) spot at the Kingsmoot.I will make this prediction season 5 we will get the Kingsmoot, that is just the kind of Wacky stuff that Dave and Dan like.So standby for some more casting suspense.

And not for some of the very stupid(you've read em) reasons for people nit picking but the sheer waste of budget and time the fight scene was in general.
The bath scene was more than adequate to show how broken he is.  
Yaras crew could have staked the dreadfort out and having realised theon had left, shadowed them and perhaps ambushed them and then you can have theon actually escaping back to Ramsay and it not seem half as contrived as this did.  Call me crazy.

Ramsay abducts Lady Hornwood who is appalled at Ramsays behaviour to get his hands on her lands.

Â 
A tower is phallic in nature so it would be a double entendre.
Â 
But you got a point, Yara was sailing for months to rescue him no matter what they did to him, so she clearly cared about him as a person not for political reasons. He was weak like hell when they found him, so just drag him off. No one said he has to be a Greyjoy heir she could tuck him away with his mother or something, she certainly would be happy.Â 
Â 
Now the Ironborn wouldn't have too much respect for their "eunuch prince" except that the best Ironborn clearly followed her to rescue Theon in the first place after knowing what exactly they're going to rescue, so it's not like they think he should die or anything.
2797	The brown snake	2014-05-19	I think she knew he would never be the greyjoy heir... he cant produce heirs unless he had bastards already around and Balon legitimised them... She just loves her baby brother and she knows the iron born will never follow him due to all those yrs with the starks but it doesn't mean she will just leave with Boltons. I am sure 'Uncle Reader' wouldn't mind another person at the ten towers. And their mother (if she remembered him) would be happy.

You guys are right to a point, but Shae led both Tyrion and me to believe she loved him.Â  That's why sending her away tore him up so much.Â  It felt like the ultimate betrayal to me because she knew exactly what it would do to him.Â  It seemed at first that she was forced to recite a script, but at the end of her lines, she glared at Tyrion saying again she was his whore, and seemed intent on giving him as much pain as possible.Â Â I don't know, I guess it's Shae's betrayal that felt so wrong.Â  I don't believe she ever loved Tyrion.Â  Maybe I was naAve to ever believe she did.Â  She did seem to genuinely care about Sansa at least.Â  Ramsay is pure evil no matter which way you look at him.Â  But he doesn't try to deceive anyone about itÂ either.Â  RamsayÂ never claims to be anything other than what he is.Â  He is proud of who he is.Â  Alfie & Dinklage knockedÂ their performances out of the park last night!Â  Maybe that performance by Dinklage was what made me hate Shae so much at the end ofÂ his trial.Â She knew exactly how vulnerable he is to that kind of pain when she betrayed him too.
Â 
ETA:Â  Shae is like a heartworm that slyly burrows it's way into the heart only to someday give you a heart attack.Â  Ramsay is like a giant serpent that come at you right out in the open to swallow you whole.Â  Her deception was horrible.
Â 
ETA:Â  Guess you guys are right, it was a dumb question though.Â  An emotional reaction to Shae at Tyrion's trial.

2809	SeventySeven	2014-05-12	Seriously? Did you see her reaction when Tyrion addressed her? She was sad and said "I'm a whore", because that's who she is, and therefore had no choice on the matter. She's a victim, too.

Â 
Agreed. I have no proof of this but I think that Cersei who found out about her conspired with Tywin to grab Shae from the boatÂ BronnÂ put her in and probably coerced her to do it.Â 
Â 
This isn't book Shae, TV Shae is suppose to be more sympathetic and caring. Of course D&D could mess this up and she did a 180 and turn evil out of nowhere.Â

2811	Daenor	2014-05-12	I think building up Shae's character and her humanization during all the previous episodes serves two purposes:
1)Make viewers more shocked and deliver a huge nasty surprise for them(obviously i'm talking about the non-readers)
2)Create some drama.Little bit cliche one might say but it goes like that "I loved you,you betrayed me by sending me away and rejecting me so now i'll screw in the worst possible way"

Â 
I think it's interesting to re-examine Shae's relationship with Tyrion in light of the fact the showrunners stayed 'on-script' more than a lot of fans expected. I'm inclined to think Shae was very FOND of Tyrion but I think she and he weren't capable of falling in love because of the inherent power dynamic problems. Tyrion held all the cards but the emotional ones in their relationship and Shae resented that.
Â 
Thus, she was never really able to love him as a person. Just her meal ticket.
2813	Daenor	2014-05-12	Oh and to answer the initial question obviously Ramsay.The guy is one of the worst scums of Westeros and has commited and unimaginable amount of atrocities.He enjoys inflicting pain to other people.

Â 
In the books as well it was Cersei who let's say persuaded Shae to testify (and obviously Tywin did his bit). IIRC Cersei says something about the fact Shae asked for marriage and other stuff in return for her testimony.
Â 
Either way, I think in the show it was clear she was left with no choice and also they broke up just before everything went down, so maybe there's a degree of pulling an Ygritte, but mostly I read it as "I'm a whore, I have no power or choice, and I'm not going down with you so I'm forced to do this to save my own skin".

Shae had a choice. It just wasn't a choice then. Shae stayed in a burning building despite the fact Tyrion said it was on fire for months.

Â 
Yes, and I don't think people should freak out too much about it. I think they'll be able to bring it around to the books in the end. Tyrion better kill her though, I don't complain too much about the show, but it HAS whitewashed him way to much.Â

2821	Octavio Malibaires	2014-05-12	Shae's actions cannot be judged until we see the scene where Tyrion goes up the Tower of the Hand. If Shae was indeed whoring herself to Tywin, then we should understand that she never really loved Tyrion (but it will not add up; I prefered the non-bullshit "Shae is just a whore" that the books too: it is more tragic to believe that their relationship was all in Tyrion's head, and that he is really a pityful man in need of care and cuddling).
2822	voodooqueen126	2014-05-12	The opening post reminds me of that saying "Men are frightened that women will laugh at them and women are frightened that men might murder them."
Honestly people have their hearts broken all the time and they get over it. Generally speaking torturing and castrating someone is considered criminal.
2823	Sun	2014-05-12	The fact that you can even compare Shae with Ramsay in any context is mind-boggling.
2824	Greywolf2375	2014-05-12	Ramsay.
Â 
Shae is a whore and does what she is paid to do.Â  She did that with the guy before Tyrion, with Tyrion...and the guy after Tyrion.
2825	AZAXD	2014-05-12	Ramsey comes off more as just crazy than cruel although I guess what he does is very cruel... but with Shae it really cuts deep.Â 
Also I don't hate Ramsay at all he's one of my favourites to watch!

2827	Not a kneeler	2014-05-12	When I watched the scene with Shae at Tyrion's trial, all I could think of was that not only was she not rocket scientist material, but she was really dumb. All she was doing was reacting to how he blew her off.Â  She never understood the threat Cersei and Tywin posed, she never got it at all. I don't think she was forced: I think she was just getting back at him for dumping her. She was just mad.Â  I think she really cared for Tyrion, but also she cared for him because he was a Lannister. Her emotions are simple and straight forward because she is shallow. Even now she probably doesn't get it that what she did would cause Tyrion to lose his life.
Â 
Comparing her to Ramsey Snow is like comparing an owl hunting mice to a serial killer. He is evil incarnate, perhaps one of the most evil and fascinating characters in the series.
2828	David Selig	2014-05-12	Wow, this is really taking Tyrion fanboyism to an absurd level.
2829	Chuck88	2014-05-12	Ramsay, no question.
Interesting that Shae throws Sansa under the bus, though.Â
2830	Debb2	2014-05-12	This has to be one of the most misogynistic things I have read on here, and that's saying something.Â
2831	Cas Stark	2014-05-12	I hope this is some kind of high level sarcarsm, and no one really thinks that the guy who tortures, kills and rapes for fun "might" be less evil than the poor girl who ended up a whore and testified against her former patron.
2832	solidviper	2014-05-12	Ramsay's by far.Â 
Â 
The way the scene played out, I think Shae's motives were more than just being paid. I think she was really hurt by Tyrion's words and rejection of her. She didn't realize I guess that it was because Tyrion was scared that his father would kill her, or maybe she thought he should've left Sansa and King's Landing and go off with her. I feel bad for Shae, and I don't understand how she's being compared to Ramsay. And Tyrion is my fave character so it's not "Tyrion fanboyism" this is something else....

2833	Batman	2014-05-12	I think the writers thought that making Shae a spurned love would add to her sympathy. Weirdly it is the opposite for me. I could at least respect her as a gold digging whore. She was just trying to further her lot in life and accepting herself. All show Shae did was bitch and moan and demand miracles from Tyrion. Â 
Â 
But that's hardly as bad as cutting his penis off and sending it to his family with the promise of mutilated all of their countrymen.Â

This.
Â 
tyrion treated her pretty well all things considered, and anyone with a working brain would've realised he lied to her in their last meeting before the last for her own good, which was paternalistic as hell, but well-intentional. She should've realised a high noble like him couldn't marry her, take the money and enjoy life in Essos. Instead she is trying to get Tyrion killed out of jealousy. Book Shae, while pretty terrible person in general, at least was threatened to some degree to testify and this was her one shot in life to get rich.
2835	solidviper	2014-05-12	The fact that she really cared about him and got jealous does not make me like Shae any less. Maybe she's not as cunning as Book!Shae, but she has more heart. I can't believe that's being looked at as being worse than purposefully manipulating someone for personal gain.Â

Â 
No. Just no.
Â 
Ramsay is worse by a million magnitudes.
Â 
I interpreted Shae's "I'm a whore" line as referencing her and Tyrion's last exchange in which he resorted to calling her a whore to drive her away. That obviously hurt her since - even though she is a whore - she thought that their relationship had taken on more meaning than that. She looked right at him and delivered the line with a more cutting tone that she had been using. I think her testifying was a combination of coercion and revenge. She wants to hurt Tyrion because he hurt her.
2837	DrownedSnow	2014-05-12	Seriously? Did you see her reaction when Tyrion addressed her? She was sad and said "I'm a whore", because that's who she is, and therefore had no choice on the matter. She's a victim, too.


Â 
A victim? Not buying it. I have no doubt she was forced to lie by Cersei but she was clearly enjoying herself and said more than she needed to if it was just to comply with Cersei or Tywin's demands. Maybe it was just bad acting and she wasn't meant to have been so spiteful and taking pleasure in it but that is hos it came across. If they wanted us to believe her the victim the should have streamlined her dialogue and made her give the bare minimum in testimony.
2838	Charles Phipps	2014-05-12	I think the classicism of Tyrion and Shae's relationship is something which shouldn't be overlooked and was always subtext.
Â 
Shae and Tyrion were never equals in the show.
And we see the poison this makes their relationship.
Sansa was just the breaking point of what was always there, that Tyrion the respectable nobleman married to Sansa could never be with Shae.

2845	sati	2014-05-12	I was wondering about somethingÂ  - as Shae is talking we see Tywin far more than Cersei.
Â 

	Spoiler In the book it is Cersei who manipulated Shae to testify. The show has tendency to whitewash Cersei - will Shae betrayal be completely attributed to Tywin? He did seem to be looking at her curiously during this trial and Cersei informed him of Shae a while back. Perhaps Cersei was still the one, but Tywin/Shae relations start after the trial and this is why those looks were showed. He also wasn't as disgusted as good old Tywin would be about whores, wasn't he?
Â 
I always wondered about Tywin - did he bed many whores? Did he bed this one because it was his son's? Did he really hate him this much? I wonder what they'll do on the show - on one hand we have Tywin trying to spare Tyrion's life. But why have Shae testify then, if he is indeed behind it?
Â 
I hope the show goes into greater detail considering how and when Shae and Tywin started as I was always confused by that in the book.
2846	Rapsie	2014-05-12	The problem is the show is trying to hit plot points, but changing the characterisation so much that the actions of the characters make little sense. 
Also, Ramsay. Murder, rape and sadism being slightly worse than embarrassing a former John.
2847	Carl Rhaego	2014-05-12	What a silly question....
Â 
Maybe I'm giving the actress too much credit, but she really seemed to be afraid and nervous, especially at the beginning and her testimony seemed to be rehearsed, like she was reciting it. She was constantly looking at Tywin as if she was looking for his approval for her 'acting'. We've had a scene where Tywin orders her to be brought to the tower of the hand. To me, it seems she was forced by Tywin to testify. Maybe he threatened her with death or she made a deal with him that he would spare Tyrion's life if he was found guilty with her help. I'm expecting a scene between her and Tywin to explain what she did, it just makes no sense for her character to betray Tyrion so severely just because he called her a whore.

It all depends on who is going to kill Shae.

Â 
In another thread someone suggested that since it is known that a Hand of the King built the secret tunnel to Alayaya's brothel,Â  this person suggested it may have be Tywin who built it.Â  No proof of that of course.Â  TywinÂ probablyÂ had as many whores as Tyrion, but just hid it better.Â  
Â 
Also, as the OP, I agree now that Ramsay is much worse than Shae... Right after the show, I was so angry with her character.Â  An overreaction I think and partly due to the fact I have met more than a couple real life women like that.Â Â  Sorry for raging on the forums about her.Â  Â  Â There have been some really thoughtful responses though, and interesting tangents too.Â  Varys testimony shocked me as well.Â  Another person I thought Tyrion could trust.Â  Thinking on it a bit IIRC Varys did warn TyrionÂ  that he would not lie for him.Â Â  Now, I wonder what my reaction to the "hands of gold are always cold" scene.

Â 
With Shae's different character on the show they actually have the potential for some Greek tragedy level drama if Tyrion does kill her (because what reason does Tywin have to kill her now, she did her part). What if she really made a deal with Tywin to get Tyrion sent to the Wall for her testimony and after the trial of combat she agrees to offer her services to Tywin in exchange for mercy for Tyrion. Then Tyrion finds her in Tywin's bed, doesn't let her explain herself and kills her and right before he kills Tywin, Tywin tells him that Shae did it all just to save him. Tyrion shoots his father with a crossbow and turns around to look at the woman he loved, and who loved him, and realizes what he's done. This would be so much heavier than what happened in the books. It would also make Tyrion's whining in the future more bearable (I couldn't stand him in ADWD).
2851	Sand11751	2014-05-12	Tyrion: Please don't do this
Shae: I'm a whore. Remember?
Â 
There's a little catch in Shae's voice that you miss in part. Also the camera pans to her after she starts the line, but her sadness and bitterness is there. Can you blame the bitch? I have no problem with what she did in the show. Tyrion hurt her cruelly; regardless of whether she might have known it was for her own good, that shit had to hurt like hell when he dismissed her. He once called her, his lady. she reminded him she was a whore, but he made her feel otherwise. I'm not mystified by what she did and think TV Shae did love Tyrion. Why be jealous of Sansa if Shae didn't have to be cause she didn't give a shit about Tyrion? Turning on Sansa at trial was BS, but again, I'm sure she felt pressure to say the two planned it just like Varys had to emphasize how Tyrion didn't cheer when Robb died.
Â 
ETA: one part of the timeline does confuse me. She's supposed to be brought to the Hand's tower. I assume somehow that happened afterward. Then later Bronn swears she's on a ship - did he lie for Tyrion's good or another motive? What's his role in Shae's appearance at trial?
Â 
Ramsay is a billion times worse than Shae. He causes physical and emotional scars. To see Theon rejecting his own name and family, that shit was just pitiful.

2853	Ser Dank the Jedi	2014-05-12	I always assumed Shae was coerced into speaking out against Tyrion. Â I think she actually loved him like he loved her, but when faced with death or speak out against Tyrion and get get gold and sleep with the most powerful man in the Seven Kingdoms, she chose not to lose her head.
Â 
It was a mean thing to do to Tyrion, especially emotionally, but let's face it, Ramsay hunts girls and flays people for fun. Â Much, much, much crueler.
2854	zombree	2014-05-12	Ramsay is certainly crueler... But with all of show Shae's declarations of, "I'm not afraid of you family" I feel like its out of charachter for the show version of her. Also I could be alone in this, but I'm kind of ticked that she just threw poor Sansa under the bus. Tyrion hurt her alright I can accept that. But the show has portrayed her as being pretty protective of Sansa. They gave show Shae so much fight and spunk that it's a weird turn around. She didnt appear to have been hurt or anything seems very out of character for show Shae
2855	Mad Monkey	2014-05-12	Wasn't there a scene in the previous couple of episodes where Bronn explicitly tells Tyrion that he put Shae on a ship to Essos? The fact that she's back then bugs me; did she come back on her own (either for the purpose of testifying against Tyrion or for some other reason) or was she grabbed/kidnapped by the Lannisters? Varys had a spy following Bronn and Shae and we know that Cersei and Tywin knew about her and knew what she looked like from that same episode after a maid tells on her. If the latter, it would strengthen the argument that Shae was coerced, if it turns out that she was dragged back by the Lannisters to testify.
Â 
I'm not sure either way though. The show and the actress did a good job of making it seem ambiguous; there were bits where it felt as if she was reading from a script, and bits where it sounded like she was saying this stuff out of her own prsonal anger and frustration.
Â 
Oh, and obviously Ramsay is crueler. Shae is at worst a perjurer; Ramsay is literally a serial killer, like Jeffrey Dahmer or Ted Bundy. No comparison.
2856	direwoofwoof	2014-05-12	Ramsey is pure evil.
Â 
Shae is just an unfortunate woman who thinks she is smarter than all the men around her but is very soon going to learn the horrible truth that she has no power, no sway, and absolutely no worth in the Lannister realm. She will realize too late that the man who treated her the best is the one she just testified against.
2857	Pod The Impaler	2014-05-12	Ramsey is pure evil.

Â 
Â 
Alas, yes.
Â 
The thing about Ramsay's cruelty is that this is what he is like all the time. The "kick you when you're down" element does not shock the audience when it comes from the likes of him. Ramsay would kick you when you're down, or up, or even pick you up just to enjoy kicking you again.
Â 
Cruelty is more shocking coming from Shae, because the idea that she would reach down into the depths of her most intimate times with Tyrion and use that to psychologically disembowel him in public does not match our prior assessment of her character. (As I said before, in the books, the element of humiliation is much stronger in that scene. Show Shae is hurt; book Shae is callously mocking him.)

Â 
True. Book Shae was more manipulative, but I do not recall her being evil-cruel like Ramsey. TV Shae seems more sympathetic.
2859	Peter George Stewart	2014-05-12	Jeez, what the hell is she supposed to do?Â  Say to Cersei "no I ain't going to testify" and probably be put in the KL dungeons or tortured and killed?
2860	Lord Damian	2014-05-12	To be fair. Ramsay is doing his for the sheer pleasure of it, he is in control. Shae is just trying to survive.
2861	Roxane De	2014-05-12	Ramsay hurt a lot of people and enjoys it. Shae hurt one person and it is unclear whether she did it on purpose. Of course it's Ramsay.
2862	Theon'sSong	2014-05-12	The fact that you can even compare Shae with Ramsay in any context is mind-boggling.

self obsessed narcissistic teenage boys operate under the belief that their feelings are paramount and more important than anything elseÂ

2863	Florina Laufeyson	2014-05-12	I'm a bit baffled as to how this is even a question


No lie. I have a special loathing for Shae. Shes the sort of person that had i known her in real life, i would secretly wish that she could beÂ erased. Thats because i hate liars and false people. However, Ramsay is Up To Eleven in the Evil-O-Meter. His nastiness is far worse than anything Shae could muster.Â
2864	Natalia Borgia	2014-05-12	Shae was a disloyal whore. Of course she is worse than a GUY who crucifies people, rapes them and cuts off their manhood and feeds it to the goats? Ya'll gotta separate Dinklage from Tyrion. Tyrion is not this nice. That is why you hate show Shae more than show Ramsay. I actually like show Shae and if DD weren't writing fan fic you wouldn't feel so much sympathy for Tyrion. Seriously.
Â 
The hate of Shae has been discussed repeatedly by the Sullied so I will just say- RAMSAY is super evil and tortures people. He is worse.Â 
Â 
Â Ramsay Snow nee Bolton is worse than a prostitute who was intimidated into betraying Sansa and Tyrion.Â
2865	Natalia Borgia	2014-05-12	Wow, this is really taking Tyrion fanboyism to an absurd level.


You ain't lying. Dang.
Dinklage is TOO good at this role. I am sure GRRM never thought there was an actor who could actually eclipse the character he wrote in the series.Â
2866	Adam de Felden	2014-05-12	Well painful as both cruelties are, i would perhaps prefer the figurative emasculation to the literal emasculation.
2867	Florina Laufeyson	2014-05-12	Of course Ramsay is worse, but im allowed to loathe Shae. <.<Â
2868	Le Cygne	2014-05-12	The opening post reminds me of that saying "Men are frightened that women will laugh at them and women are frightened that men might murder them."Honestly people have their hearts broken all the time and they get over it. Generally speaking torturing and castrating someone is considered criminal.Â Excellent.Â The problem is the show is trying to hit plot points, but changing the characterisation so much that the actions of the characters make little sense.Also, Ramsay. Murder, rape and sadism being slightly worse than embarrassing a former John.Â Exactly.Â  They go on a different journey, and do different things, for different reasons, yet somehow would end up in exactly the same place.Â  Fascinating.

Like Yara's invasion of the Dreadfort; she could not rescue Theon because he is destined to escape on his own. Even though she was literally right there in the room with him and Ramsay was apparently outnumbered (and naked?) she could not rescue Theon or kill Ramsay. She couldn't even move when he was playing with the key and taunting her. You can't fight City Hall.
2870	Kingpin	2014-05-12	Ramsay.Â 
Â 
Unless, his character is a product of mental illness, genetics, abuse or something like that. Can you really say the hyena is cruel for eating her prey alive? No, it's an animal. Â 
Â 
Shae on the other hand, even though her life was hard, isn't insane. She can leave her past behind her, it wasn't responsible for what she did. She just wanted to hurt him and take revenge, without even thinking about whether he was just trying to protect her, even after all the times he said so before.Â 
Â 
So Shae is pure evil, no sickness outside of her control involved. Like I think Tywin is more cruel than Joffrey was, because he wasn't crazy as the product of incest, nor a spoiled teen boy that suddenly gained too much power.Â 
Â 
So it depends on what drives them, and what drove them there aswell.Â
2871	Le Cygne	2014-05-12	It could be a metaphor about fate, destiny, and predestination. Like Yara's invasion of the Dreadfort; she could not rescue Theon because he is destined to escape on his own.

I was dissing the Shae change, they dispensed with all of that and slipped her right into book Shae's story.But I like what you said, too. In that case, they are the same characters, but something is off, and they know it. That's cool. Theon was destined to escape on his own.

2872	Wade of House Wilson	2014-05-12	While I agree that Ramsay is worse, did everyone really get the feeling that Shae was completely coerced? She seemed nervous, sure, but I think it was a little bit of conscious sneaking in due to her line when speaking directly to Tyrion. The "I'm just a whore, remember," line (or something close to that) seemed like she was throwing Tyrion's perceived betrayal of her back in his face. She refused to understand that Tyrion wanted to send her away to protect her, and the testimony was, at least in part, revenge for that. She may have been threatened or influenced by Cersei or Tywin to some degree, but her final words showed her anger and petulance clearly.Â
2873	Gort	2014-05-12	Ramsay.
Â 
Shae is a whore and does what she is paid to do.Â  She did that with the guy before Tyrion, with Tyrion...and the guy after Tyrion.


Â 
And deep down, Tyrion knew it. Self-delusion falls on the self. I suppose it's a problem with the show not being able to give the viewers Tyrion's inner monologue, particularly where he castigates himself for being so stupid by not accepting that she's a whore who's just playing his game.
Â 
Oh, silly question's answer: Ramsey.
2874	Ryuho Martell	2014-05-13	Shae had a reason to do what she did.  Her hurt feelings or somebody's influence. And it's not that strange to have a hurt woman acting like that.
Ramsay's just a sick bad person.
2875	DormeDwayne	2014-05-13	Can anyone be crueler than Ramsay? Shae doesn't even come close, even though I agree showShae is undoubtedly cruel.
2876	lightbringer333	2014-05-13	Superexcited to see tywin hump shae n tyrion watching secretly n getting pissed.
2877	Wethers	2014-05-13	Obviously Ramsay is more evil (if Shae is even "evil" at all), so no contest for all the reasons stated.
Â 
But I also think just dismissing Shae's actions as embarrassing a john or even breaking his heart leave a rather key point out. Â The man is on trial for his life in front of the whole realm, and she knowingly bears false witness against him (and against Sansa) in the most damning way possible, in both the series and the books.
Â 
Of course she was coerced. Â Thus - not evil exactly (and again, comparing her to Ramsay is ridiculous). Â But it's definitely not something to admire, or to dismiss as insignificant and merely a trifling affront to oversensitive narcissistic teen male readers. Â Not every character would have done what she did at the trial.
Â 
I hate the whitewashing of Tyrion in the TV series. Â But I suspect that, for all his other flaws and darkness shown in the books, Tyrion would not have borne false witness against Shae in the same way had the roles been reversed, even to save his own skin. Â It's true, even prior to his moral descent at the end of aSoS, Tyrion could be selfish and cruel, but there were certain situations in which he was self-sacrificing, especially where his sense of loyalty was concerned (e.g. leading sortie at Blackwater). Â Anyway, obviously that role reversal is a hypothetical, just my hunch really that I don't think Tyrion would have done the same. Â But, regardless, taking the farcical Ramsay comparison out of it, I just want to reiterate that I don't think Shae's betrayal should be minimized. Â She deserves empathy and a better fate than what befalls her, but not exoneration.

2878	NOT A TARG I SWEAR	2014-05-13	Ramsay and its not close. Shae never did anything remotely as bad as what Ramsay probably does every morning before breakfast. Shae just seems bad at the present because of expectations and who she perpetrated those acts against. Shae probably was partially coerced into those actions as well, although I do think she took some pleasure in those actions and went above and beyond what would have been necessary.
Â 
I'll admit to never really liking her much on the show though, even at first when they were initially attempting to shove her down the audience's throat by making her into one of the modern surrogates/badass/fun/hot ciphers. This question though I think is just gonna go in some dark/misogynistic directions.Â
2879	MyLittleFinger	2014-05-13	Eh...one cut off a dudes dick after flaying off a number of fingers...I don't think this is a contest.
2880	solidviper	2014-05-13	I don't understand how Tyrion is a part of this convo? Do you guys think the idiots that think Shae is worse than Ramsay are saying that because they just love Tyrion so much?
Â 
I love Tyrion a lot, but there's no freaking way I would ever be so delusional to think Shae is worse than Ramsay. There is a such thing as liking Tyrion and still being sympathetic to Shae.Â 
Â 
I think those that think Shae is worse have deep seeded issues with women and are projecting.
2881	Schokolade!	2014-05-13	Wow, this is really taking Tyrion fanboyism to an absurd level.^^this!
Ramsay is the most cruel character on the show even Jofferey couldn't compare! Jofferey would have killed Theon a long time ago probably without mutilating him but Ramsay keeps him as a pet! 
Ramsay even asked Reek to pretend he's Theon Greyjoy right after he made him take a bath while he stared at his (missing) junk with a delighted smile, how messed up is that? 
Seriously what did Shae ever did in your book that compares to that?

2882	Gus Petch	2014-05-13	We don't know yet why Shae testified against Tyrion. Â I'm witholding judgment until we know a little more.
2883	Panther2000	2014-05-13	Great Points,Â  I don't know if we are talking Book vs TV show.Â  But I will go with the show.Â 
Â 
1) How the heck did she get off of that boat.Â  I don't think that Bronn would like to tyrion, especially after the way he told Jamie that he has to fight( go see his brother in jail).
Â 
2) I think that she was under pressure to do this, but she was more than happy to go along with it because tyrion hurt her & pretty much left her the day he married Sansa.
Â 
Â 
Â 
Shae Vs Ramsay.Â Â Â  No contest, Ramsay is the winner hands down.Â  Shae fell in love & betrayed the man when he sent her away.
Â 
Ramsay, on the other hand not only Abuses you Physically but mentally, lets not forge the Dogs.Â Â Â  Those hunts don't help either.
2884	ChrisSnow77	2014-05-13	IMO book Shae & tv Shae are two totally different characters.
Â 
Book Shae uses Tyrion, has no feelings for him, and when he is no longer useful to her she betrays him.Â  She is extremely cruel and Tyrion killing her was a great moment.
Â 
TV Shae while sometimes annoying clearly had feelings for Tyrion and was at least at first a more likeable character,Â  she felt betrayed by Tyrion and either turned on him because of that, plus her acting conveyed that she may have been coerced strongly into her testimony.
Â 
Meanwhile book & tv Ramsay are both sick SOBs demented and evil.
2885	starklinson	2014-05-13	Sure, Shae betrayed Tyrion, but nothing can compare to the physical and psychological torture Ramsay commits.
2886	I'll pay the iron price	2014-05-13	Ramsay is even more Sadistic than Gregor Clegane!
2887	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-13	Why on Earth is this a question? Did you miss her nuanced performance complete with hesitance, jittery eyes, sad voice, she was obviously being forced and her performance was great.Â
2888	OnlyOne	2014-05-14	I hate them both. If Martin doesn't eventually kill Ramsey via direwolf I'll be very disappointed. But seriously, clearly Ramsey is much worse.
2889	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-14	Death by Direwolf, I love it.
2890	Uldra I	2014-05-14	first here is a link to HBO'sÂ intent with the trial scene:Â  narrated by cast and crew.Â  Very informative.Â  LINK

Â 
Shae was forced by Tywin and Cercei to testify on their behalf. Shae probably was captured and her life threatened by the Lannisters. She was told that if she would give damaging testimony about Tyrion that he would be allowed to live and she would be reunited with him. Being naive she believes them to be true to their word and believes she is helping Tyrion in an otherwise impossible situation. This scenario allows viewers to still have hope about the sincerity of her love and devotion for Tyrion.Â 

Â 
Never considered Shae may actually be trying to save Tyrion's life by her testimony.Â  She may have thought, well if she testifies, she won't die, and Tyrion won't either... he will just go to the wall.
Â 
ETA:Â  I still hate her for her betrayal.Â  Did you see the spite filled look she gave Tyrion when she said "I am a whore.Â  Remember?"Â

2891	Alia Atreides	2014-05-14	the difference between TV Shae and Book Shae is the former has a heart, intellect and she wants more than to be someone's whore -- for that reason alone within the TV series her actions are understandable and more forgivable IMO. Book Shae for me was so superficial, she never ever loved Tyrion and yes she was a whore it was all she knew to be...Â 
Â 
Ramsay Series and Ramsay Book are both detestable sadists. So no brainier Ramsey it takes a special type of THING as I am not sure if he qualifies as human Ramsay to do what he did to another human being even if they were/are a turncloak.Â
2892	Le Cygne	2014-05-14	Love those Sibel Kekilli interviews, she's saying what I have been saying, the Shae changes were for nothing. Suddenly as an actor, she finds her character in book Shae's place, and can't figure out how she got there, so she can't figure out how to play her. I sympathize, watching it and knowing it was heading that way wasn't easy, either.Just seeing this, death by direwolf, perfect.

2896	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-15	Not liking jovial show ramsay though, wheres the greasy spluttering monster
2897	TimeKills	2014-05-15	Surely it is obvious that when Tyrion demands trial by combat Shae looks stunned. To me it says plainly that her agreement to give testimony incriminating both Tyrion and Sansa ( in  exchange for Tyrion's life ) has just gone belly up. I would guess Tywin pulled the same trick on her that he did with Jaime. 
If she had just been forced to testify to save her own life , why would it matter to her that Tyrion wants trial by combat.
Look at Cersei at the end of the trial scene. She was quite happy with trial by combat as Tyrion is still likely to die ( cue Mountain)
Therefore seems likely that although just a whore, and a fairly stupid, irritating woman, she had tried her best to save Tyrion's life. The man who in her own small mind had dismissed her,... because she was just a whore. She hates him, but she still loves him enough to betray Sansa.
Worst I could say was that tv Shae was naive, shallow, irrational, headstrong and also pretty stupid.
So stupid it stretched belief fairly regularly, but then so do the comments on this forum.
Shae versus Ramsey in the evil incarnate contest?  I just think the question is very odd.

2899	Mad Monkey	2014-05-15	I feel like the writers shaved a few IQ points off of Shae when they had her go from liking Sansa to being paranoid and jealous of her. It didn't really make any sense to me; Tyrion treated Sansa with barely disguised terror and Sansa acted like a walking corpse. If she saw that as a threat she must have been watching a different TV series from the audience.Love those Sibel Kekilli interviews, she's saying what I have been saying, the Shae changes were for nothing. Suddenly as an actor, she finds her character in book Shae's place, and can't figure out how she got there, so she can't figure out how to play her. I sympathize, watching it and knowing it was heading that way wasn't easy, either.That's my opinion. There was this kind of odd snapback where Shae's character development just kind of unspools. Tyrion and Shae made the best decisions; he gave her up, and she went with Bronn to the Free Cities, apparently far from the Lannister's clutches. Yet somehow she finds herself being marched into the Red Keep to give the same testimony that she gave in the books... There has to be more to the story and I expect it will be revealed in subsequent episodes, but I can see why it's bewildering.
2900	Le Cygne	2014-05-15	I don't think there's much more to it, though, she said she questioned it, asked them, don't make her say a line, that sort of thing. She seemed to just have to make sense of it in her mind in order to play the part.
2901	Mad Monkey	2014-05-15	No, I meant, I think there's much more to Shae's story. I don't understand how the Lannisters got to her; did Bronn lie about sending her overseas? Did she somehow return on her own? Did Tywin have agents there? Did Varys spirit her back? I don't think she came up with her testimony all on her own; was it all scripted for her by Cersei, or was part of it from Cersei and part of it her lashing out at Tyrion for what he said to her when they parted?
2902	Le Cygne	2014-05-15	I knew what you meant, I just meant it's never going to make sense. I don't think they'll explain very well, and if they do, it still won't make sense. I think they'll just be vague. Otherwise, why would she be struggling with how to play it, to the extent she had to fill in the blanks herself.
2903	TimeKills	2014-05-16	Why is she a fairly stupid, irritating woman?

I think because the tv character seems to have no conception of her own danger, which would be stupid. Also she ignores the clear description of the danger she is in from someone who clearly loves her, more stupid. She ignores clear warning from a master of spies who has no emotional ties, that might protect her, extra stupid.
 In a palace full of spies she shouts and postures and flounces about in a way that became very irritating to me because i find stupid irritating. Especially in myself, but also in this character that the actress made me like. Mostly it was like watching a headless chicken in a fox coop.
2904	TurkeyRod	2014-05-16	Shae is worse she is doing it for profit, but Ramsay although he seems wicked he cant be blamed. Ramsay does't fully understand how terrible his actions are because of his horrible childhood / upbringing, and he is a psychopath.

...Are you for real?Â  
Â 
Now that comparison would make sense if Shae was doing Ramsay-esque things for profit. Bearing false witness in order to save her own skin is a nasty, but understandable thing to do. Claiming that makes her worse than full-blown psycho who gets off mutilating people...
2909	7th-key	2014-05-16	On the theme of responsibility, yes, Ramsay's cruelty might be inborn, because he is a psychopath, and as a sickness one might argue that it's not his fault. But no matter the cause, the level of cruelty of his action is unimaginably high.
Btw. how come Shae's childhood isn't taken into consideration? There could be some level of mental instability in her, too.
Â 
I doubt the thread question was an invitation toward a philosophical discussion on "who is worse: a sick person who commits unnameable atrocities, or a person considered sane who willingly commits crime X?". More likely it was resentment about being dumped by an ex-GF, because there are tons of people in Westeros whose intentions and behaviours are more scheming and hurtful than Shae's. Including book!Tyrion for enriching Bowls of Brown with a certain singer.
2910	Hath4	2014-05-16	ramsay had a tough childood , that does not excuse his cruilty. he is a serial killer. he understands his actions.are wrong but choses to commit them due to the joy of commiting them. yes its sick but in no way if you tried him in a court could never obtain an insantiy plea. lots of peole have hard childhoods and go on to live perectly normal lives, ie not feed girls to dogs or chop off appendages from prisoners. it is complety his fault and there is no way to absolve him of his crimes due to insantiy.
2911	Mad Monkey	2014-05-16	Yes.Â Â Â Cersei and/or Tywin.If that's the case then there will definitely be a change in how Bronn is viewed by Tyrion, right? In the books he merely declined to help Tyrion against the Mountain; if Bronn actually delivered Shae to the Lannisters, then that means that he was part of Cersei's conspiracy.
2912	Uldra I	2014-05-17	On the theme of responsibility, yes, Ramsay's cruelty might be inborn, because he is a psychopath, and as a sickness one might argue that it's not his fault. But no matter the cause, the level of cruelty of his action is unimaginably high.
Btw. how come Shae's childhood isn't taken into consideration? There could be some level of mental instability in her, too.
Â 
I doubt the thread question was an invitation toward a philosophical discussion on "who is worse: a sick person who commits unnameable atrocities, or a person considered sane who willingly commits crime X?". More likely it was resentment about being dumped by an ex-GF, because there are tons of people in Westeros whose intentions and behaviours are more scheming and hurtful than Shae's. Including book!Tyrion for enriching Bowls of Brown with a certain singer.Actually, yes, this was the intent of my OP.  Can a psychopath/sociopath be held to the same degree of responsibility for their actions as someone with a conscience?  I have conceded that what Ramsay has done is clearly worse ,on a purely physical level, than shae's betrayal of Tyrion.  The moral ambiguity comes with the fact that Ramsay, even though knowing his actions are 'socially' unacceptable still believes he is right in what he has done.  Shae otoh has callously deceived Tyrion from the beginning.  She has essentially destroyed Tyrion emotionally and for all we know as TV viewers, physically.

Yes what Ramsay did is wrong, and maybe the fact that he can't figure that out is reason enough to exterminate him. But, Unless Shea has no conscience like Ramsay, then she knew what she was doing is wrong.  The portrayal of her lies on the witness stand, floored me.  She didn't reveal a bit of guilt for what she was doing to her "Lion of Lannister."

2915	Pod The Impaler	2014-05-17	It's also a matter of proportion vs. a matter of expectation. What you expect from Shae is not to horribly humiliate her former customer lover customer. Of course, when Ramsay Snow Bolton does (much more) horrible things, it is expected: he basically likes to kill and torture for his own entertainment. Expectation makes Shae's cruelty be more emotionally shocking to the viewer / reader, but having a sense of proportion makes one see her actions are not in the same league.
Â 
Look at it this IRL example:
Someone detonates a bomb in Boston and 3 people die - the world is shocked and appalled (at least from the media accounts); it is the front page of every paper, the lead story of every newscast, and people go through elaborate memorials and tributes and whatnot.
Someone detonates a bomb in Baghdad and 30 people die and in fact, there is such a death toll from bombings in Iraq every week. The world just shrugs, barely remembering that the bloodshed there never actually stopped. Nobody covers the funerals, and few people even go to them because a) there are so many, and b ) often the perpetrators will then bomb the victims' funerals.
Of course Boston's violence cannot match Baghdad's; even in terms of the same sort of violent act, proportionally it is just not in the same league.
Â 
What we expect matters more to us than any rational quantitative analysis of which is actually worse.

Wow!  Talk about gaining perspective.   Yeah, expectations play a large role in my prejudice on this issue.  I do know a couple people who I suspect may not have a fully developed conscience in rl.  Sometimes their ethics blow my mind, but on the other hand, it seems like they are genuinely trying to do the best they know how.

It also explains why Jon Snow, Ned, Catelyn, Dany, Sansa, etc. get way more criticism on a personal level than Cersei, Gregor, Ramsay, Vargo, and Aerys. No one really expects any better from the Bloody Mummers.
2918	voodooqueen126	2014-05-17	Â 



When I watched the scene with Shae at Tyrion's trial, all I could think of was that not only was she not rocket scientist material, but she was really dumb. All she was doing was reacting to how he blew her off.Â  She never understood the threat Cersei and Tywin posed, she never got it at all. I don't think she was forced: I think she was just getting back at him for dumping her. She was just mad.Â  I think she really cared for Tyrion, but also she cared for him because he was a Lannister. Her emotions are simple and straight forward because she is shallow. Even now she probably doesn't get it that what she did would cause Tyrion to lose his life.
Â 
Comparing her to Ramsey Snow is like comparing an owl hunting mice to a serial killer. He is evil incarnate, perhaps one of the most evil and fascinating characters in the series.


Book Shae! whilst not particularly bright, was atleast motivated by rational desires (financial security, ie the completely rational not desire to escape , not being a camp follower/professional rape victim/gonorrhoea, herpes, chlamydia and crab incubator), whilst book Shae's child hood abuse (her father wanted to turn her into his wife)and general impoverishment Â made her inability to experience empathy (for Sansa) much more explicable/sympathetic.
Which leads to...
Â 


I think the writers thought that making Shae a spurned love would add to her sympathy. Weirdly it is the opposite for me. I could at least respect her as a gold digging whore. She was just trying to further her lot in life and accepting herself. All show Shae did was bitch and moan and demand miracles from Tyrion. Â 
Â 
But that's hardly as bad as cutting his penis off and sending it to his family with the promise of mutilated all of their countrymen.Â 


Turning Shae into a silly, Jealous Woman Â<U+0099> makes her far less sympathetic. Â It turns her from the heroine of her own story (albeit a story that GRRM did not write) into a romantic attachment of the hero. Also I think Book Shae's! testimony was in part motivated by vengeance (as well as coercion): Tyrion was her client, yet he basically failed to pay her for all of book 3, she felt cheated and short changed(which would have made the disgusting sex (see above 'sexually abused by her own father') even more unbearable... can you imagine her turning that over inside her mind (I let him put his disgusting male body in mine, using me, I performed like a mummer, and yet he fails to pay me).... A woman can be motivated by money just as much as her heart and still be sympathetic.

What? That's not true about TV Shae at all.
Â 
Also psychopaths knowÂ  that what they are doing is wrong, they just don't care.

Â 
Also psychopaths knowÂ  that what they are doing is wrong, they just don't care.


Just tried to follow aÂ thread discussing the distinction between sociopath and psychopath,Â and never could quite figure it out.Â  The one thing thatÂ I took from the conversation is that one or the otherÂ version could intellectually know what society viewed is right or wrong, but just didn'tÂ hold him/herself to the same mores.Â  (guessing that was the sociopath Â )Â Â  In other words, the sociopath knows what other people think is right and wrong, and accepts that he/she has a different view of things.Â  They always operate on what they, themselves believe.Â  They don't consider other people's opinions as relevant, important, or as wise as theirÂ own ideas about things, and make decisions accordingly.Â  That means that even though they may know what other people think is right or wrong they may not agree, and simply don't have the inner moral compass to know the difference.Â Â  As anÂ example, just think about the times in the books when Roose wants to scold Ramsey for this or that extreme cruelty, but Ramsey honestly defends what he did as being the "right"Â Â thing for the Boltons.Â  Creepily enough, Roose usually ends up agreeing with Ramsay's assessments.Â Â  Not saying what Ramsay does is excusable.Â  It is not.Â  I wish Melisandre couldÂ get ahold of his ass. And Roose's too, for that matter.
Â 
Â 
Both book and show Shae may have loved Tyrion in that he was her first rung on the ladder to "the big time" crowd.Â  At first she was star struck, in awe with her very own Lannister.Â  Tyrion raised her from the mean life of a camp whore to lord's mistress, and soon became in love with her.Â  Â Eventually she realized there are more rungs she could climb, above Tyrion, and she bided her time, refusing to leave KL in hopes of reaching the next rung.Â  I think that the fact that she ends up naked and comfy in Tywin's bed verifies she was onlyÂ waiting for the chance to move up.Â  Shae's fully conscious and maliciousÂ treatment of another human being she hadÂ once loved (however shallowly), was the ultimate blow to Tyrion,Â a man whoÂ hadÂ opened himself andÂ let himselfÂ become extremely vulnerable to her.Â Â Â In the senseÂ that Shea worked so diligently over such aÂ long a time to build her power play,Â  and then was fully aware of the utter destruction her betrayal wouldÂ cause Tyrion in the trial, her choices seem less forgiveable to me.Â Â 
Â 
Have to admit, a lot of the posts before have softened me up enough to feel more wishy washy though.Â  Guess by this point in the thread it is just interesting to noteÂ that there is very little to no empathy out there for the socio/psycho path.

Â 
Â 
I don't think show Shae is less sympathetic - probably more, since she was more fierce and willing to defend others and stand up to people. Book Shae, despite being more mercenary in motivations and indifferent towards Tyrion, in many ways book Shae is more "silly", and it shows. (Mind you, book Shae is also younger and less worldly.)
2922	Pigeon Pie	2014-05-19	Ramsay, no contest. Shae was motivated by jealousy, heartbreak, etc (not to mentiom stupidity- by all accounts, Tyrion was right about all the things he did and said to her or so was his intention at heart, only to put her out of danger) while Ramsay is just pure psychopath.
2923	Florina Laufeyson	2014-05-11	Yeah time to be salty ol jerks and seethe about junk you dont like.Â 
Â 
I got one real big nitpick with this episode. That fucking goat. RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGE!!! If the show doesnt eventually have that guy come back with the bones of his kid, im going to riot. Seriously. Im really mad about that. Snapping mad. Its incredibly important that the dragons nom on a human. Its the whole reason Dany locks up her dragons come on!  Fix it, show! FIX. IT.Â 
Â 
Naked Ramsay is not a nice thing to see. I dont care how cut he is, no! NOPE! NOPE! I have a feeling that that girl he keeps slammin' might wind up as Fake Arya.....just a thought...
Â 
I kinda wish Stannis spoke more but im ok with the change of him being in Braavos.Â 
Â 
Â
2924	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-05-12	Stannis didn't even get to speak his case. Seems Cogman has agreed to D&D propaganda.Â 

Asha-Dreadfort plotline totally useless.Â
2925	LordStoneheart	2014-05-12	I think it was definitely a set-up for a kid-munching later. This episode showed Dany in a "oh whoops, I'm sorry" kind of light with Drogon. I'm sure some Unsullied can forgive it... but when the child's bones do show up... Yeesh. My guess is, her season finale end is agreeing to marry Hizdahr and locking up her dragons.
2926	lacuna	2014-05-12	The Ironborn assault on the Dreadfort...Â  The Dreadfort is on the other side of Westeros in relation to the Iron Islands. Did they sail around Dorne just to make a half-assed attempt at breaking Theon out?
2927	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-05-12	The whole 'raid on the Dreadfort' sequence was very clumsy. I don't know if it was the writing, or editing, or directing, or a combination of these, but it felt awkward and rushed. Why superimpose Yara's speech with Ramsay's sex? Why do a rush job of the actual infiltration? Why the odd cut between Yara running and her arriving at the boat? Dogs are faster than humans. You want me to believe Ramsay was bluffing and never let the dogs out? Why the writing inconsistency of Ramsay letting Yara go? The Reek stuff was great, though.

It was obviously set-up. Hilarious how some readers feel negative about this non-issue due to expectations and lack of insight.
2928	Aerys Vengeance	2014-05-12	Asha at Dreadfort is the best example for a total failure in writing a storyline. The Ironborn, known as the strongest warriors of Westeros, not fearing any battle even if they are outnumbered...getting jimjams because an unarmoured bastard nutjob releases some dogs.

I hope there will be something in Moat Cailin that might rescue the whole plot.Â

"Daenerys has 8032 Unsullied, the Second Sons, 3 dragons, Jorah and Barristan Selmy are with her too. Oh, and she is sitting on a series of 5 different pillows when she receives supplicants, and shifts them around once per hour."
"How do you know that - is Jorah still spying for the Iron Throne?"
"No. Not for a long time now."
"THEN HOW, VARYS ? SERIOUSLY. ARE YOU GETTING THIS INFORMATION BY SHIP OR A LIVE WEBCAM STREAM GLASS CANDLE?!"

Â 
Well I assumed Varys has manyÂ  little birds across narrow sea, its not a secret Jorah and Barristan are on her council it would be known in the conquered city I guess.
Â 
The scene with Davos in the bathouse, I'm am not sure if it was the delivery of the joke, acting or I was just plain distracted but I did not follow the red shirt joke at all, just cringed a bit to whole start of the scene.
Â 
As for Asha storyline, the Ironborn having trouble with ramsay, outrunning the hounds and saying her brother is dead was so anticlimatic after that rushed morale boosting pre battle speech. It felt like a cartoon where the cat goes in after the mouse only to come face to face with seething bulldog and with all conviction lost scared mindless runs out in cloud of dust.
Â 
Shae delivery also took away from intensity the trial scene for me. Thats about all the minor gripes I have with this lovely episode !

The writers probably think it made him cool and awesome. He's basically a comic-book super-villain on the show, lel.
2933	Yojimbo	2014-05-12	The whole Dread Fort scene was a joke, I wondered what the hell they were doing back in season 3 with Asha, Yara even, (still to this day don't get why they changed her name >.<) glad to see as I thought then it would lead to no where. And I thought Craster's Keep story last week had the all the hallmarks of bad writing, guess I was wrong.
Â 
Stannis......my poor misunderstood king......why do they hate you so? The only thing I liked about his scene was at least they haven't butchered Davos to death yet.
Â 
The trial I did like though, in the context the show has pictured the characters at least. The only thing I did miss was "my giant of Lannister" but wasn't expecting it to come up. But I am going to make a bet now, Tyrion won't kill Shae.
Â 
The council meeting I can see already will set up grief for me down the road when Tywins letter gets to Dany speaking of Jorah's "betrayal", unless Barristan confirms this of course. But then why has Barristan kept his mouth shut till now and how would show Barristan even know? Whats more, why would Dany take the word over a enemy than a trusted advisor? And yep looks like Mace is going to be the new clown of the court.............

2934	Petyr Patter	2014-05-12	I would have liked to see a bit more agency out of Stannis regarding the bankers, but I suppose the king dreams while the hand builds.Â  Regardless, the "Iron Bank as a Temple" was on full display and I enjoyed this segment, but this is a nitpick thread.
Varys is breaking from the books and giving Tywin Lannister full and accurate intelligence regarding Danaerys.Â  This contradicts his real allegiance, and his need to keep the Iron Throne blind and unworried about Essos.Â  I suspect they are writing themselves into a corner for Varys.
They have almost completely butchered Mace Tyrell's character.Â  Yes, he was a fool in the books.Â  However, he was a self-important fool, Lord Pufferfish his mother called him.Â  He has an ego, and it needs to be fed.Â  We do get a bit of this when he calls dibs on Master of Ships, but completely lose it when Tywin orders him around like a squire.Â  The man is Lord of Highgarden and knows it.
I did not like Yara at the Dreadfort.Â  For starters, overlapping Yara's speech with Ramsay and a woman was just... unnecessary.Â  Inevitably, the entire thing turned into a plot cul-de-sac when Yara flees having changed nothing.Â  However, the scene struck me as a continuity error.Â  We saw Roose return in episode 1 or 2.Â  If his castle was attacked, we should have seen him.Â  Furthermore, he simultaneously ordered Ramsay to take Moat Caitlin.Â  Ser Locke got to the Wall and Craster's Keep while Ramsay is still sitting around in the Dreadfort?Â  I'm almost positive this scene was originally meant to come before Roose's return, but something happened in the process and we now have a continuity error.
Wait, did Tywin just somewhat acknowledge that Jaime fathered children not named Lannister?Â  The fact that he always refused to do so was one of his fatal flaws in the books.Â  Martin is bit like the ancient Greek playwrights.Â  The protagonists will fall, but it will be because of their flaws.Â  I don't like Tywin losing them in the show.
Finally, what is the leaving the Mountain's role as the Crown's champion up in the air?Â  For one thing, it creates a bit of a plot hole.Â  Tywin knows declaring the Mountain as the Crown's champion is a very bad idea.Â  However, having Cersei declare him the Crown's champion in public is just vintage Cersei.Â  She picks the most feared fighter in all of Westeros, going for the most powerful option on the table, but missing the not at all hidden implications damages her cause and creates another mess for Tywin to clean up.
I really did like this episode, but this is a nitpick thread.
2935	Natasi	2014-05-12	I said it in another thread, we still don't know for absolute certainty that Drogon killed the kid in the books. Is it likely? Yes. But if it happened, it was off page and the reader and Dany can only guess.  The show might film it, but until they do, it isn't a undisputed fact, just a likely assumption.
2936	The Silver King	2014-05-12	The show is actually following the book for once, it was a common thing for herders and the like to present the bones of their livestock for reimbursement before the situation with the child. I'm sure they will have the human bones presented to her at some point, although as others have said it is never really confirmed that Drogon did it in the first place.

Â 
If you note, Drogon flew right past the child.Â 
Â 
If it did happen (which there is a good chance of) it happened by Â accident, he wasn't purposely hunting the kid.Â

Â 
Yea if it really did happen I think it was an accident as well, if Dany's dragons were interested in hunting humans they would of been doing so a long time ago.
Â 
I actually think the show did a good job at setting up the whole human bones thing if they go there (which I hope they do). Drogon basically just burned everything in his path to get that sheep so it's really easy seeing a kid getting caught up in a fireball like that.
2939	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-05-12	I would have liked Davos' part after they were rejected were for Stannis.
2940	Roose Seal	2014-05-12	I, myself, thought the foreshadowing in the dragon scene couldn't have been heavier if they tried.Â
2941	Hot Kidney Pie	2014-05-12	I hate how they waited this long to show us The Onion Knight's bare hand.
I do like Hizdahr asking for a proper burial for his father.
However.. I will NOT be happy if the fighting pits don't get brought up.
They could always introduce it otherwise.. But the fighting pits were the reason Hizdahr came to see Dany in the books. We shall see.. We shall see.

2942	Night's_King	2014-05-12	Huh, this time I have really not much to complain.
Â 
The First four episodes were horrible, the 5th was great and this episode has made it directly in my top 5!
Â 
The only thing I want to complain about is the Dreadfort-Scene. Not only pointless but illogical.
Â 
Drogon not burning the child is just the usual Dany-whitewashing, but I don't want to complain about that, because the Hizdahr-scene was great and showed that the world is not so black and white as Dany sees it.
2943	DarkerStar	2014-05-12	The lack of the giant of Lannister line was a glaring omission for a book reader I thought. That was the line where Tyrion lost it in the books IMO

Â 
You're right! I totally forgot about that!
2945	toffeejay	2014-05-12	The dragon whitewashing - awful. An extreemly important part of Dany's story in Meeren. But its ok because she paid the man for his goats. He looked as if he was skipping out the door in celebration.Â Â  
Â 
If they are doing that with Dany I really fear if Tyrion's Shae scene is going to get the same treatment.
2946	Fat Mac	2014-05-12	Gonna have to complain about the goat too. But its okay, if Stannis ruled Meereen, that kid would be burned alive for worshipping the wrong gods 
Â 
The Yara scene was weird, but I'm glad they didn't spend that much time on it, especially because we pretty much knew nothing was going to happen from it. But no fucking way could Ramsay fight shirtless and not be killed, especially because he's a moron. Also, no Roose? His own goddamn castle was attacked.
Â 
The KL scenes I thought were executed more or less briliiantly.
2947	BorhPT	2014-05-12	i wonder how did Ramsay could fight against the ironborn. he's known to be fierce, but a bad fighter... but he showed some moves over there. he should have died in the first minute  specially with no armor.
Â 
also the letter sent to asha its a joke. it's not in skin and he signs Ramsay SNOW, Lord of the Dreadfort and Warden of the North, which he's neither. also the scene is pointless and geographicaly near to impossible
2948	Mark Antony	2014-05-12	I think its pretty clear a kid will be killed by Drogon in the future. They don't have much story to spread for Dany over the next couple seasons. Surprised to see people saying this episode whitewashed her tbh. Hizdahr made her look like shit
How the Yara/Ramsay situation played out is probably my only nitpick. Thank the gods for Alfie Allen he was great
2949	NightStark	2014-05-12	he signs Ramsay SNOW, Lord of the Dreadfort and Warden of the North, which he's neither. also the scene is pointless and geographicaly near to impossible
No, he signs it Ramsay Snow, natural son of Roose Bolton; Lord of the Dreadfort and Warden of the North.
Roose has the titles, he just writing with Roose's voice.

2950	Angmar	2014-05-12	Whoever thought we needed Ramsay fanservice is clearly high. And him fighting and winning shirtless...Yeah, totally realistic.
Â 
Asha was just anti-climatic and filler.
Â 
I do hope we do get eventually the child burning storyline. I'm guessing they'll want that for bigger impact on the season finale or episode 8.
Â 
KL was good, but I don't get why the necklace seemed in perfect shape- last we saw it, Littlefinger smashed it to pieces.
2951	FC_Lymond	2014-05-12	I thought the dragon scene was confusing.Â  It was quite unclear who the dragon burned.Â  The camera is focused on the boy the whole scene.Â  Then the guy drops some nondescript bones on the floor.Â 
Â 
I think they were trying to keep it vague until the guy said goat, but it didn't work that well.
2952	Hangover of the Morning	2014-05-12	The lack of the giant of Lannister line was a glaring omission for a book reader I thought. That was the line where Tyrion lost it in the books IMO


Â 
I agree that it's a shame but I am not really sure if TV!Shae ever called TV!Tyrion her Giant Lannister. And if she did, it definitely wasn't memorable so bringing it up at the trial might seem a bit odd.

You could see Drogon roast the goat and take it.

2954	Sigrunn	2014-05-12	The dreadfort scene was terrible; it solved nothing and Ramsay's lack of proper armour made him look as if kryptonite is his only weakness.
Â 
I disliked something within the Iron Bank plot as well.
Â 
To the OP:
Given that people used to present Dany with various burned skeletons to receive compensation, I'm certain that we'll see Hazzea's bones as well. However, I doubt that Drogon is the one responsible for her. It may be wrapped up as an accident or one of the Harpy's lies; I don't think that Dany's dragon hunts children on purpose.

That was clearly a goat skull. Not nondescript at all.
I'm no fan of show!Dany but this scene was obviously set-up for the child bones scene later on.
We were introduced to the fact that Drogon hunts freely. We were introduced to the fact that he just burns whatever's on his path. We were told that some shepherds are kids. We were introduced to the fact that people come to her with their grievances. All of this is set-up for a child being toast in a later episode.

Â 
They don't, and they never will.
2958	RavenKing23	2014-05-12	^^^  Jaime is lame anyway. More of an annoyance than a nitpick but when the court sits down for the first time. Far left hand corner a man with a cane waits a second after everyone sits then he sits down. Theres always that one asshole
2959	AZAXD	2014-05-12	I think it was definitely a set-up for a kid-munching later. This episode showed Dany in a "oh whoops, I'm sorry" kind of light with Drogon. I'm sure some Unsullied can forgive it... but when the child's bones do show up... Yeesh. My guess is, her season finale end is agreeing to marry Hizdahr and locking up her dragons.


That ending would be awesome. I wanted all my Unsullied friends to be extremely disappointed with Dany.
Â 
And I do hope that was just a set-up for future kid snackin'. Changes don't bother me much but c'mon... KILL SOME KIDS - PISS PEOPLE OFF!
Â 
Got me thinking about the show trying to play it safe in certain areas - weirdly I wantedÂ to see the remainder of Theon's junk when he was getting into the bath. Just because it would be nasty. Maybe something's wrong with me.

2961	Angmar	2014-05-12	Let's see the Unsullied reaction to that...
Â 
"Oh well it's not Dany's fault, that stupid boy shouldn't have walk around where Dragon eats his food! He deserves it!"
Â 
Honestly the Dany forgivers...:roll:

D&D will make sure that it will be the boy's fault to run into Drogon's path, whitewashing will continue of Dany.
2963	Sun	2014-05-12	Ramsay allowing Asha - a valuable hostage to makeup for the one he ruined - to get away makes absolutely no sense.Â Asha not trying to kill Ramsay when she had the chance makes even less sense. The whole Dreadfort sequence was very very weak.Â 
Â 
The IB backing Stannis at this juncture makes absolutely no sense. I went into my reasoning in the Stannis thread so I won't go through it again here.
2964	Jamie Lannister	2014-05-12	In the books, Jaime decided to help Tyrion on his own, in the show, Tyrion and even Bronn are chiding him.
They really don't like Jaime, I get it.


Â 
I don't think that's fair. Jaime can't do a thing for Tyrion in the books until the final chapter, and presumably that's going to play out in the same way. That he's struggled a bit with how exactly he can help his brother before then isn't a bad deviation IMO, especially since offering to step down from the KG if Tyrion's life is spared was of his own volition.
Â 
Ramsay and Asha's showdown was lame. It started off decent and the combat choreography was fine, but holy shit they dropped the ball at the end. Shirtless Ramsay effortlessly butchers a bunch of the Ironborn's finest killers, then chases off Asha by very slowing preparing to... open a dog cage. Bullshit. There is no way save for the grace of plot that he walked out of that room as the winner.
2965	ladyinblack	2014-05-12	No Giant of a Lannister lines & it is used so much in the books-perfect for TV
Think Asha is so poorly cast- 1 of my favorite book characters
No way she could get to Dreadfort.  Why? Just stupid & Asha wasn't. She & her storyline constantly evolve in the books
Brilliant acting & camera work in this ep. Pretty damn good this week
2966	Milcov	2014-05-12	People seriously think that was whitewashing? It was set-up. In the books Dany is paying goatherders for weeks before Drogon kills the child. It's showing how Drogon hunts in order to establish what will happen when human remains are brought in to everyone's surprise. Also Dany hasn't really been whitewashed at all, she came out of that discussion with Hizdahr very poorly.
2967	Phil Sand	2014-05-12	Â 
Â 
Finally, what is the leaving the Mountain's role as the Crown's champion up in the air?Â  For one thing, it creates a bit of a plot hole.Â  Tywin knows declaring the Mountain as the Crown's champion is a very bad idea.Â  However, having Cersei declare him the Crown's champion in public is just vintage Cersei.Â  She picks the most feared fighter in all of Westeros, going for the most powerful option on the table, but missing the not at all hidden implications damages her cause and creates another mess for Tywin to clean up.
I really did like this episode, but this is a nitpick thread.
Â 


For the show they need to build up the mountain as a character to be feared as the promo for episode 7 shows, also it will be a more intense scene when we learn the mountain is the crowns champion, then cut to Oberyn walking into Tyrions chamber and declaring himself.

That was actually better drama, it set up what was to come much better.They have to make everyone who may be compared in any way to Tyrion less of a man. They did the same with the Hound, because Sansa likes him. I think Jorah is up next, who knows what they will do to make him worse.
2970	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-05-12	Yup genuinely flabbergasted people are saying this ep whitewashed Dany.


Sure we are flabbergasted, i mean it is not like her fans are being wilfully blind right?Â
2971	Greywolf2375	2014-05-12	Â 
I got one real big nitpick with this episode. That fucking goat. RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGE!!! If the show doesnt eventually have that guy come back with the bones of his kid, im going to riot. Seriously. Im really mad about that. Snapping mad. Its incredibly important that the dragons nom on a human. Its the whole reason Dany locks up her dragons come on!  Fix it, show! FIX. IT.Â Â 
Â 


Â Why?Â  While it would have an impact, it will be far more impactful to see her get used to the goats and then be presented the childs bones.
Â 
- the IronBorn turning into a large group of Ser Robin's and running away bravely.Â 
- while it fits in character to some point, the fact that Stannis does nothing at the Iron Bank fell flat
Â 


Â 
Drogon not burning the child is just the usual Dany-whitewashing, but I don't want to complain about that, because the Hizdahr-scene was great and showed that the world is not so black and white as Dany sees it.


Â that's an overreaction.Â  If they take it out completely, fine, but to have that be the first time we see them breathe like that would have a fraction of the impact if they let it grow with the dragons becoming more powerful and wild & then burn a child.
2972	Mark Antony	2014-05-12	Sure we are flabbergasted, i mean it is not like her fans are being wilfully blind right?Â  
I mean I like Dany as a character I'm not some weird Dany fanboy or anything though  and I do agree she has been whitewashed in the past but I just didn't see that last night at all.
2973	Phil Sand	2014-05-12	i wonder how did Ramsay could fight against the ironborn. he's known to be fierce, but a bad fighter... but he showed some moves over there. he should have died in the first minute  specially with no armor.
Â 
also the letter sent to asha its a joke. it's not in skin and he signs Ramsay SNOW, Lord of the Dreadfort and Warden of the North, which he's neither. also the scene is pointless and geographicaly near to impossible


Ramsay is never shown to be a bad fighter he is shown to be a reckless and fierce fighter with no technical aspect more of a man in rage just swinging his sword.Â
2974	Dofs	2014-05-12	-Asha's attack on Dreadfort. Wow, what a useless and stupid storyline.
Â 
-No 'Giant of Lannister', I was waiting, waiting for it... and got nothing.
Â 
-I do question that Iron Bank would give Stannis money based on what Davos had said. I would definitely not give them my money. What if Tywin decides to attack Stannis and kill him tomorrow? How Stannis would have stopped that?
Â 
-Jaime's puppy eyes. Ugh. If I never knew that this is Jaime in the show, I would have never recognized him.
2975	Le Cygne	2014-05-12	Jaime's puppy eyes? I couldn't even hear what was being said for Tyrion's puppy eyes every other frame.I know, the big reveal next episode: Jorah is Drogon's goat pusher. He gave him a little and then a little more, and before long, insatiable desire for goat. 
					
					
							Edited by Le Cygne, 12 May 2014 - 08:15 AM.
2976	David Selig	2014-05-12	Asha at Dreadfort is the best example for a total failure in writing a storyline. The Ironborn, known as the strongest warriors of Westeros, not fearing any battle even if they are outnumbered...getting jimjams because an unarmoured bastard nutjob releases some dogs.
Â 
I hope there will be something in Moat Cailin that might rescue the whole plot.Â 


This so much.
Â 
They travelled what, 2000 miles to get there and save Theon, and ran away from a few dogs even though they were wearing armor. Just so stupid.
Â 
The way Tywin is treating Mace is ridiculous. Mace can overthrow the Lannisters any time he wants, yet Tywin treats him like a servant and he accepts it.
2977	Fat Trell	2014-05-12	Asha was terrible. No two ways about it. This seems like a plot that was introduced for virtually no reason other than to remind us Asha is a thing. 
Old Man Roose needs his sleep. He can't be bothered by trivial things like invasions of his castle.
We now know why Balon was scared to invade the Westerlands though. Way too many hounds over there.
My man Mace...why HBO, why? The slander is borderline demonic imo. Let him live.
I wish they would have had the court laugh at Tyrion. That is such a pivotal moment in the books. Was very keen insight into Tyrion as a man. Without the humiliation of having his time in KL come full circle(going from making others the object of derision, to being the laughing stock) I don't think he would have had such an angry outburst.
But TV Tyrion hasn't been laughed at as often as Book Tyrion, so that makes sense. Still an excellent scene. Maybe the best the show has done.
2978	Dofs	2014-05-12	Jaime's puppy eyes? I couldn't even hear what was being said for Tyrion's puppy eyes every other frame.


That too, but Tyrion redeemed himself in the end. Jaime did not, unfortunately.

it was a poor scene for the iron born but the scene was there too show that theon had truly become reek.
2980	Le Cygne	2014-05-12	That too, but Tyrion redeemed himself in the end. Jaime did not, unfortunately.By murdering Shae? Her continued existence was going to bring down the seven kingdoms, for sure.

Yeah, it was a nice sounding speech, but it didn't make much sense. No sensible banker would risk money on such a long shot when those in KL continue to pay the interest on the IB loans. What if Tywin lives another 10 years and Tommen grows up to be a decent king? That's way more likely than Stannis winning the war from his current position. or what if Tywin's army just crushes Stannis in a month? No matter how much money the IB gives him, the Lannister - Tyrell will still have a huge advantage in numbers.
2982	Fat Trell	2014-05-12	Also the Iron Bank would have never thrown in with Stannis at this point, imo.
Tywin is alive. Despite all his personal failings and dickishness, he is viewed as reliable. Tywin's whole image is about competence; ruthless, bitter competence. The idea that he wouldn't have found a way to pay the IT debts(heh) is underminding. Even with the ridiculous dry gold mines.
Even ignoring Tywin though, Stannis is a losing horse at this point. No heartfelt speech from Davos about how great a guy Stann is should have changed the mind's of these near fanatical bankers.
2983	boojam	2014-05-12	36 episodes in...What in the seven hells have the dragons not been named yet?!

I mean in the end of the episode with his speech. That speech was great.Â
2985	Le Cygne	2014-05-12	I was thinking the same thing about the dragons. What do we call Drogon. Big Nameless Dragon. Who is tied directly to Dany's identity. BIG part of her later story. Named for Khal Drogo. A reminder that he once existed. And meant something to Dany. Mustn't have that, out of sight, out of mind, this is Game of Thrones. Nobody remembers anyone.

I think its pretty clear a kid will be killed by Drogon in the future. They don't have much story to spread for Dany over the next couple seasons. Surprised to see people saying this episode whitewashed her tbh. Hizdahr made her look like shit

Â 


  Â the season finale is called "the Children". I'll bet we'll be seeing burned bones in that episode. I'm curious though whether or not they'll show the kill. In the books I have never been convinced of Drogon's guilt (it was an accident if he did it), the timing for the dragons imprisonment was just to convenient.

2987	neutrino	2014-05-12	Did anyone else see a logical flaw in Davos speech to the Iron Bank that there would not be peace in the seven kingdoms under Tommen as long as Stannis lived?Â 
Â 
Iron bank "OK well since we want peace in order to get our money back from the Iron Throne, we will just kill Stannis right now"Â 
Â 
Would be a much smarter response than "Oh ok then, here have all of our gold, good luck!"Â 
Â 
I always assumed the leverage that tipped the Iron Bank towards Stannis was the fact that the Lannisters had stopped paying them, a fact eluded to in the show last week when Tywin announced the gold mines had yielded no Ore in years. Made perfect sense in the books as by the time the IB was involved, Tywin was dead and Cersei had given orders to stop paying their debts.Â 
Â 
Not only all of this but it was also a very boring scene.
2988	Cas Stark	2014-05-12	Dreadfort. Â The Ironborn are afraid of dogs? Â What? Ramsay let's Asha go, what? Â The dogs didn't end up chasing anyone, what?
Â 
And I guess since Ramsay had a bunch of tiny little cuts on his chest, unless his girlfriend did that, IB aren't very good with swords either. Â LOL.
Â 
And lets all give ourselves a pat on the back, those of us that correctly predicted we'd get a pointless Essos brothel scene at some point. Â
2989	Dofs	2014-05-12	I've also forgot about how Tywin was treating Mace. The show is really sacrificing logic for involving amusing scenes here.
2990	Grand Maester Mithrandir	2014-05-12	The Asha/Dreadfort scene served nothing but to show us that Ramsey loves to brawl with no shirt on.
I don't like that Tycho speaks with a perfect English accent, I mean the guy is Braavosi! Same goes for friggin Hizdar zo Loraq.
I was relieved that they chose not to do the whole Drogon child eating thing now. I'll admit that my heart did stop as soon as I saw that scene come on.
2991	Le Cygne	2014-05-12	Yes, Asha's heretofore unknown dog phobia.
2992	PatrickStormborn	2014-05-12	The Dreadfort storyline was a total mess. Why was Asha's speech played over Ramsay having sex? It looked like the show was parodying itself, tbh. And the fight was just ridiculous... Ramsay was shirtless, and the Ironborn carry throwing axes... Why is he still alive?
Â 


Sure we are flabbergasted, i mean it is not like her fans are being wilfully blind right?Â  


Â 
Are you being serious? The bones of Hazzea (or a replacement character) will still be brought before Daenerys. But it needs appropriate set-up. Anyone who thinks logically about narrative progression will surely see that.
Â 
If anything, they made Dany look WORSE than in the books with this episode. In the books no one pleads innocence for any of the Great Masters who were killed... The problems with Dany's punishment is that 1) it went too far or not far enough (i.e. she should have punished ALL the Great Masters, or pardoned all of them), 2) it was "an eye for an eye" - it would have been more appropriate to use a "fairer" method if she decided to kill the same number, and 3) that she let the masters turn themselves over. In the books the fact that the punishment was collective was never really presented as the biggest issue; in fact, in the narrative it was presented as the alternative to killing all of the Great Masters:
Â 

Â 
In the plaza before the Great Pyramid, the Meereenese huddled forlorn. The Great Masters had looked anything but great in the morning light. Stripped of their jewels and their fringed tokars, they were contemptible; a herd of old men with shriveled balls and spotted skin and young men with ridiculous hair. Their women were either soft and fleshy or as dry as old sticks, their face paint streaked by tears. "I want your leaders," Dany told them. "Give them up, and the rest of you shall be spared."
Â 
"How many?" one old woman had asked, sobbing. "How many must you have to spare us?"
Â 
"One hundred and sixty-three," she answered.

Â 
She then decides to have them taken down and follows Missandei's advice to return their bones to their wives and families. Clearly crucifying 163 Great Masters was a terrible decision, but it's important IMO that Dany comes to realise this on her own.
Â 
The fact that Hizdahr of all people lectured Dany just irks me. Why even bother to name him Hizdahr if he is so far removed from the book counterpart? The show's Xaro Xhoan Daxos was more in-line with book Hizdahr.Â
2993	Le Cygne	2014-05-12	The fact that Hizdahr of all people lectured Dany just irks me. Why even bother to name him Hizdahr if he is so far removed from the book counterpart?

2994	Hot Kidney Pie	2014-05-12	I like that Jamie wasn't just standing around..
The backdoor deal with Poppa threw a nice wrench in the bag..
Who really thought Tyrion would join TNW though?? I mean... Come on..
Dinklage nailed that scene though.Â 
I truly dislike the acting of Shae.. (as I always have).. She's just awful, can't wait to see that actress (don't even care enough to ever learn her actual name) get the CHOKE.
I'm going to miss Charles Dance though... BAD

I thought even her biggest haters here would stop whining for a week that Dany has been whitewashed on the show. Alas...
2996	Grand Maester Mithrandir	2014-05-12	Also, I know Mace Tyrell is not supposed to be the sharpest tool in the shed, but having a scene where Tywin has him fetch his stationery for him, really? That was just unnecessary.
2997	Mark Antony	2014-05-12	I thought even her biggest haters here would stop whining for a week that Dany has been whitewashed on the show. Alas...
Exactly what I thought lol ah well
2998	NaarioDaharis	2014-05-12	Has anyone else felt that Tyrion's monologue was very overacted? I did not feel engrossed in his anger. It was very awkward to me. I don't think book Tyrion was oozing froth when he said that. But, show Tyrion has never done anything slightly "meany-headed" before so I guess he is new to it.
2999	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-05-12	What was with the lame ass 'stare down' between Tyrion and Tywin?
Â 
Dinklage crushes his monologue, we have a series of surprisingly compelling reaction shots (Oberyn and Jaime in particular), then an awkward staring contest breaks out in the middle of the courtroom... thud.
3000	Le Cygne	2014-05-12	Has anyone else felt that Tyrion's monologue was very overacted?Yes, it was overacted. Chewing up the scenery. As someone said, Charles Dance just makes a move and he upstages him.

3005	David Selig	2014-05-12	Has anyone else felt that Tyrion's monologue was very overacted? I did not feel engrossed in his anger. It was very awkward to me. I don't think book Tyrion was oozing froth when he said that. But, show Tyrion has never done anything slightly "meany-headed" before so I guess he is new to it.


I thought so at first, but then I reasoned that Tyrion was supposed to be hamming it up, playing the part of the monster people consider him to be, playing itÂ  to the gallery, only in reverse, so it worked for me.
3006	BorhPT	2014-05-12	Ramsay is never shown to be a bad fighter he is shown to be a reckless and fierce fighter with no technical aspect more of a man in rage just swinging his sword.Â 


Â 
and that's why he shouldnt last a minute against a seasoned ironborn warrior imo. but he actually toys with him like he's the expert there, instead of just hacking and slashing his way through
for the tv viewer, they just get the impression that Ramsay is agile, quick and experienced, instead of the raging beast that he is on the books. but not a big problem there for me. I can see this scene building up for their reunion later in the show, where he recognizes her and claims to be Theon again.
Â 
what it's still confusing to me is Stannis in Braavos. did he got the gold he needed now? will Saladhor not desert him? Will he have his sellswords sooner? will Tycho Nestoris ever go to the Wall? i hope they dont change that a lot
3007	Mark Antony	2014-05-12	Â Not cool Antony.
It was more so a dig at the Stannis devotion
3008	OccupyHarrenhal	2014-05-12	I'm not a big Dany fan either, but I can't believe the goat thing is such an issue. I think it was really obvious in that scene that he lost his child and was afraid to say it. They didn't just show the kid for fun.Â
3009	Dany's Golden Fleece	2014-05-12	Â 
Â 
Â 
  Â the season finale is called "the Children". I'll bet we'll be seeing burned bones in that episode. I'm curious though whether or not they'll show the kill. In the books I have never been convinced of Drogon's guilt (it was an accident if he did it), the timing for the dragons imprisonment was just to convenient.
Â 
Â 

 

Â 


Â 
Â 
Yeah will probably be the last episode.Â  But yeah I am unsure how a dragon nibbles around the bones so as to able for the father to show her the bones.Â  Unless said father followed Drogon around waiting him to poop.
Â 
Could have easily beaten the kid to death in a drunken range, when he sobered up her burnt the body, collected the bones to get some money out of it.Â  Its possible.Â  But I guess it doesn't really matter in terms of the story.

Yes, it was overacted. Chewing up the scenery. As someone said, Charles Dance just makes a move and he upstages him.


Â 
Serious question(s): have you gone back and re-watched Tyrion's monologue out-of-context, and do you still feel it was overacted?
Â 
I thought the same thing on my initial viewing, but I wonder if it's because Dinklage is actually conveying complex emotions and he's largely surrounded by cartoon characters. Â Perhaps that's just my inner-Dinklage apologist...

I think they were teasing the book readers and their expectations with the kid. The dragon passed over the kid before he started blowing fire, the kid remained well behind and isn't seen in the shot with the flames, he should be fine.

i think Tycho will go to the wall but only too check up on stannis and make sure he is still going for the iron throne, i can see where you are coming from with the ramsay, iron born battle but they need too show that ramsay can hold his own so it will be all the more interesting when stannis brings him down.
3016	Lord Thornhart	2014-05-12	Once again Stannis is portrayed as a one dimensional evil guy because the Unsullied audience are too stupid to understand a complex character and the writers are too stupid to make one.

Unless Yara is going to the Kingsmoot, I don't care about her TV show character anymore.

Can i ask what you mean by "saint tyrion whitewashing" ?
3021	LordStoneheart	2014-05-12	Let's see the Unsullied reaction to that...
Â 
"Oh well it's not Dany's fault, that stupid boy shouldn't have walk around where Dragon eats his food! He deserves it!"
Â 
Honestly the Dany forgivers...:roll:


Â 
I'm a Dany fan through and through and I never have seen any defense near this. There is no defense for it. It is what it is. That's what dragons wrought. The way to be a Dany fan about it is to accept it, not excuse it.Â
3022	LordStoneheart	2014-05-12	Daario in the previews is not being cocky, when he should be. Did they just decide Dany prefers mild mannered men?


Â 
Dany prefers whatever men she prefers. It's not a crazy character change
3023	Le Cygne	2014-05-12	Can i ask what you mean by "saint tyrion whitewashing" ?You've got to be kidding. Read the last two dozen nitpick threads. Full of examples.The author calls him the grayest of the gray characters. Have we seen that?
3024	Lord Thornhart	2014-05-12	Â How was he portrayed as evil in this episode, he literally sat in a bank, and discussed getting a loan. You guys crack me up with some of these complaints.


Â 
Because he still wants the throne out of greed and lust, not law and duty. The "bitch make me sound important while I glare at the wall" look he gave Davos is bad too. Stannis did not advance his character at all by justifying himself and is still the guy who thought burning his nephew would make dragon statues come alive and fight for him.
3025	Salad Days Saan	2014-05-12	There are perfectly valid and logical reasons why Asha would retreat at that point, and there is a clear parallel to draw between this scene and the last time she tried to rescue Theon (season 2, trying to convince him to retreat from Winterfell).Â  She can't save him if he won't save himself, not gonna throw her own life away for nothing, etc.
Â 
HOWEVER.
Â 
The show clearly did not do a good enough job of explaining/illustrating that for people.Â  One of Asha's mooks did start to have a line about them running out of time, which is correct:Â  she doesn't have a massive, overwhelming invasion force, this is a small crack force.Â  It's a commando raid, in and out quickly.Â  Once the alarm bells start going off and the dogs start barking and the superior numbers of the Dreadfort get roused and can put the place on lockdown they are vastly outnumbered and have No Way Out.Â  Or at least, we can PRESUME that, being logical human beings with critical thinking skills, with no thanks to the show, which chose not to show this.
Â 
Instead, the Ironborn look like the Keystone Kops Vikings and run away just because Ramsay's about to SMITHERS RELEASE THE HOUNDS.Â  Thousands of characters (usually villains, admittedly) have been in Asha's position before and sworn "this isn't over, I'll be back" at the end of an episode where they are FOILED AGAIN.Â  That would've gone a long way.Â  There's a difference between giving up for now and giving up for good.Â  The former is logical.Â  The latter just makes her early AwesomeSpeech look stupid.
Â 
And really, it's all symptomatic of the show painting itself into a corner in the first place with this storyline.Â  Theon can't get rescued and Asha can't get captured and Ramsay can't be the one to run away because it's his home field.
Â 
At least Asha got to fuck a couple people up with AxeHusband.Â  Finally.
3026	solidviper	2014-05-12	Yes, it was overacted. Chewing up the scenery. As someone said, Charles Dance just makes a move and he upstages him.


Â 
What? I thought it was really well done, though Charles Dance is amazing. I think the writers are doing exactly what I thought as far as making Tyrion do a complete 180 into the dark, and I think Shae was the straw that broke the camel's back. That's why it felt shocking or overacted. That's not Peter's fault, it's a writing decision.Â
3027	Phil Sand	2014-05-12	You've got to be kidding. Read the last two dozen nitpick threads. Full of examples.

It is undeniably whitewashing, they have not included pretty much of all of his morally questionable or plain morally wrong acts except the ones which are really indispensable for the plot (like sticking with his family until now).
Â 
I made a thread about it some time ago, with examples from the first two seasons, and since then the trend has continued - http://asoiaf.wester...hing-of-tyrion/

He hasÂ been treating his bestfriend like a bitch for 2 seasons and continues to do so. They did not advance his character from the early propaganda, so nothing has changed. Stannis did not think killing Edric would do anything in the books, he told his wife he wouldn't kill his family when she got on her knees and begged him to. In the TV show, Stannis actually says burning his nephew will make him a king. So much facepalm.

Let me ask you the reverse, has he done anything wrong on the show, or if he has, has it actually been shown as wrong? Or is he just the victim of others.
3038	The Drunkard	2014-05-12	Â

In the TV show, Stannis actually says burning his nephew will make him a king. So much facepalm.


Â 
I'm not sure if I'm reading you wrong, but while book Stannis starts out much as you described, completely against the sacrifice, once all three kings have been seemingly slain by R'hllor he reaches the point where he's ready to kill him.Â 
Â 

	Spoiler "[Edric] is one boy! He may be the best boy who ever drew breath and it would not matter. My duty is to the realm." His hand swept across the Painted Table. "How many boys dwell in Westeros? How many girls? How many men, how many women? The darkness will devour them all, she says. The night that never ends. She talks of prophecies . . . a hero reborn in the sea, living dragons hatched from dead stone . . . she speaks of signs and swears they point to me. I never asked for this, no more than I asked to be king. Yet dare I disregard her?" He ground his teeth. "We do not choose our destinies. Yet we must . . . we must do our duty, no? Great or small, we must do our duty."
Â 
"I know the cost! Last night, gazing into that hearth, I saw things in the flames as well. I saw a king, a crown of fire on his brows, burning . . . burning, Davos. His own crown consumed his flesh and turned him into ash. Do you think I need Melisandre to tell me what that means? Or you?" The king moved, so his shadow fell upon King's Landing. "If Joffrey should die . . . what is the life of one bastard boy against a kingdom?"
Â 
"You swear there is no other way? Swear it on your life, for I promise, you shall die by inches if you lie."
Â 
"If I must sacrifice one child to the flames to save a million from the dark . . . Sacrifice . . . is never easy, Davos. Or it is no true sacrifice. Tell him, my lady."

Â 
All pretty random lines to include if he was never considering it. I do agree though, that the way they made him come to this decision was pretty poor. Giving Melisandre permission as soon as Gendry arrived on the island was stupid.
3039	Rooseman	2014-05-12	I really didn't like how Varys reported about Daenerys at the counsel meeting.Â 
Â 
Whatever his true agenda might be, heÂ definitely doesn't want the 7 kingdoms to unite and prepare for an invasion. But this is exactly what he does, when he portrays Daenerys as a danger that has to be taken seriously.
Â 
In the books, he's more like "Some sailors talked about seeing a kraken on the shore, in Qarth there's talk of dragons, and beyond the wall they claim to have seen some snarks as well"
But on the show, he gives a detailed report about Daenerys' strength. He talks about her three dragons, and when Cersei waves it off "Three small dragons..." he responds that they're growing every year. Actively making them more cautious, where they would remain oblivious if he just kept his mouth shut.

i asked you a simple question i was not trying to be offensive i was merely curious, The show and the books are entirely different entities, and finally up until ADWD i did not find anything wrong with Tyrion that was why i was asking a question.Â
3041	Seer of Green	2014-05-12	I thought the dragon scene was confusing.Â  It was quite unclear who the dragon burned.Â  The camera is focused on the boy the whole scene.Â  Then the guy drops some nondescript bones on the floor.Â 
Â 
I think they were trying to keep it vague until the guy said goat, but it didn't work that well.

You kinda had to be looking for it but you could clearly see the goat's horns. Had I focused on the ribcage first, I would've thought them tge child's bones. And even though I saw the horns first, the ribcage did give me pause. I can't remember but when Hazzea's father presented the bones to Dany in the book, wasn't there goat remains mixed in with Hazzea's? Or was it just Hazzea's? Dany doesn't realize at first, is it because she knows he's a goatherder and therefore assumed the remains to be those of a goat or did she actually see some goat remains?

I can respect that. Â I'm not nearly so diplomatic with my criticism of the show.
Â 
I'm going back and forth on that scene at the moment. Â Watching it live last night I thought Dinklage overacted it to an almost embarrassing degree. Â Watching only his speech again this morning (out of context), it seemed like a compelling and believable portrayal of a desperate man releasing 30 years pent up frustration.
Â 
However, I just re-watched the entire episode while browsing the forum and again the monologue seemed a bit over-the-top and out of place. Â I think maybe it was a 'good' performance just not the 'right' performance, given he's acting grey in D&D's world of black and white. Â I dunno...

Littelfinger threw the necklace into the boat on top of Dontos' body.Â  Pycelle said they pulled it off of Donto's body.Â  Presumably, the boat drifted back into the bay and was retrieved.

And his fans will say he does no wrong, and it goes into 20 pages, so I gave you the best answer, see for yourself.Did they show this? "Tyrion Lannister, Lord Protector of Winterfell. The prospect gave him a queer chill."Â Or "I want Winterfell..." Or present the forced marriage from Sansa's point of view at all?Â Or did Benioff say on the Inside the Episode how much it hurt his pride that Sansa rejected him.Â I can respect that. Â I'm not nearly so diplomatic with my criticism of the show.Â I just prefer to blame the showrunners, not the actors. How else is he going to play this ridiculously heroic character they've written, in a saga where even the so-called good guys are deeply flawed, that's the best part of the story. I think if they had given him book Tyrion to work with, he'd have done fine.

3051	boojam	2014-05-12	It is undeniably whitewashing, they have not included pretty much of all of his morally questionable or plain morally wrong acts except the ones which are really indispensable for the plot (like sticking with his family until now).Â I made a thread about it some time ago, with examples from the first two seasons, and since then the trend has continued - http://asoiaf.wester...hing-of-tyrion/He's a different Tyrion on the show, that ship has sailed, and it's fine with me.

Â 
Ironborn running away from 2 dogs was laughable
Â 
Really didn't like Dinklage's performance- ok, he can shout and snarl, but not once did i feel Shae made him anything other than angry---no devastation, contempt,shock, self-loathing or sense of betrayal,,,just shouting and snarling.

3053	JesterX	2014-05-12	I can respect that. Â I'm not nearly so diplomatic with my criticism of the show.
Â 
I'm going back and forth on that scene at the moment. Â Watching it live last night I thought Dinklage overacted it to an almost embarrassing degree. Â Watching only his speech again this morning (out of context), it seemed like a compelling and believable portrayal of a desperate man releasing 30 years pent up frustration.

Â 
That Tyrion breaking down sceneÂ just didn't feel right.Â It felt forced.Â Â As if the show wasn't ready for it.Â  I don't think it was Dinklage's acting.Â  My guess is that they're following so many characters they didn't give Tyrion's characterÂ sufficient screentime to lead to that scene.
3054	Phil Sand	2014-05-12	I understand, the answer is just too long, and if you didn't see any bad things he did until ADWD, it would be even longer. And his fans will say he does no wrong, and it goes into 20 pages, so I gave you the best answer, see for yourself.
Did they show this? "Tyrion Lannister, Lord Protector of Winterfell. The prospect gave him a queer chill."Â  Or "I want Winterfell." Or present the forced marriage from Sansa's point of view at all?Â  Or did Benioff say on the Inside the Episode how much it hurt his pride that Sansa rejected him.


thankyou for reminding me of some of tyrions acts (it has been a while since i read the books) but i thought they showed the marriage too sansa from tyrions side pretty well (i could be mistaken as i haven't read the books in a while).
3055	TyrionsFlagon	2014-05-12	I think it was definitely a set-up for a kid-munching later. This episode showed Dany in a "oh whoops, I'm sorry" kind of light with Drogon. I'm sure some Unsullied can forgive it... but when the child's bones do show up... Yeesh. My guess is, her season finale end is agreeing to marry Hizdahr and locking up her dragons.


I agree with your set-up thought, and really like your prediction for the season finale.
3056	TyrionsFlagon	2014-05-12	Yeah, the necklace thing was stupid. Littlefinger's not that foolish to leave all that evidence on a floating boat. I wish the show would have gone on more with the random and false accusations. I was wondering why they hadn't burned the boat Dontos was on; 'makes sense now.
3057	Dornish Whine	2014-05-12	Ramsay... there is no way he would have survived that fight. In the books we are told he is not much of a fighter. His skills are compared to a butcher and we know he has never been formally trained.

Yeah, had the same problem but maybe they just wanted to show that Ramsay is more beast than man and therefore extremely dangerous. He goes by some primal instinct.

i understood ramsay's referance to a "butcher" a bit different i took it as ramsay was a butcher with his enemies, hacking at his enemies with ruthless blows, in the books it was stated he was not technical, but he was a savage and formidable opponent in his own right.

The show's portrayal of distance is notoriously inconsistent, of course, but Yara managed to circumnavigate the continent in less time than it has taken Arya and the Hound to ride from the Twins to the Bloody Gate.

Â 
I thought the trial was over all great, but it will be interesting to see what Shae's motivation for testifying is.Â  It can't be gold or she would have taken Tyrion's offer.Â  Perhaps just jealous spite?Â Â  Tyrion and Shae's "love" was never convincing to me in the first place.Â  She was a constant jealous bitch towards him, and he was always doing some thing to piss her off.Â  They didn't even have that many sex scenes.Â  What was there really for either one of them to like about the other, much less love?

These are the guys who play the 'finger dance' in the books where they throw axes at each other for sport. One of them should have been able to at least wound Ramsay, if not bury a blade in his chest from across the room. Think of the fight Mormont had with the Dothraki (who's name I sadly do not recall); it was his armor that saved him against that savage and formidable opponent.Anyways... I understand why he survived. But the Iron Born were made to look like fools by that scene. Failing to wound a shirtless Ramsay and then being chased off by dogs... pathetic.
3070	Fat Trell	2014-05-12	I have read the books and watched the show from the beginning, and there is a subset of people on this forum who don't like Dave and Dan's take on Tryion, it's goofy to me that they call it white washing, but Peter is a different Tyrion from the books.
What I see is that Dan and Dave have taken Peter's personality and integrated it into his acting skills, as visual media he is , to my mind, a Tyrion with more dimensions than in the books, and that's fine with me.
The horse has bolted the barn and some people won't let it go.

Being nicer is not having more dimensions. It is a fallacy that making characters more likable is the equivalent of good story telling. 
Tyrion on the show does not have more dimensions than book Tyrion. Book Tyrion is capable of incredible acts of decency and cruelty. He is a man of truely conflicting interest.
Show Tyrion has commited no acts of cruelty. He isn't murderously jealous . He isn't insecure beyond measure. He is simply a good man fighting to save his family. 
Tyrion is an intersting character because he is both the best and worst of us. The show has taken his negative traits and either made them extremely superficial or nonexistant.
Of course this only applies to this point in the story.
3071	Dornish Whine	2014-05-12	{iron born stuff I already agree with)I thought the trial was over all great, but it will be interesting to see what Shae's motivation for testifying is.Â  It can't be gold or she would have taken Tyrion's offer.Â  Perhaps just jealous spite?Â Â  Tyrion and Shae's "love" was never convincing to me in the first place.Â  She was a constant jealous bitch towards him, and he was always doing some thing to piss her off.Â  They didn't even have that many sex scenes.Â  What was there really for either one of them to like about the other, much less love?I think Shae's motivation came off as jealous spite to most viewers. I think there was some hint that she was under threat from Tywin/Cersei as well... but the unsullied I watch the show with reacted in a "What a petty bitch" sort of way and not a "Poor girl is terrified" sort of way.
3072	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-12	I don't really see what "whitewashing" of Dany you all saw last night. She was presented like a dismissive Queen and really regretful of the situation she got herself into it, besides the speech of Hizdhar, telling her that she acted like a freaking butcher. While Stannis is doing anything he can to be King, she has this face of "I wish I was everywhere but here".
Â 
And, they showed the Dragons are out of control. It was very close for Drogo to kill that kid and I'm sure he will next episode, or eventually.

Â 
I agree. Â That goat skull was prominent in the shot with the bones. Â I think several farmers are going to be bringing goats by to collect their fees, and then one day, it's very obviously going to be a child's skull in the bones and not a goat. Â Dany has set the worth of a goat eaten by a dragon at three times it's sale value - watch her horror when she has to try and place some sort of value on a lost child. Â I also like your prediction for Dany's season end. Â The opposite of the sort of triumph for her that we usually end on.
Â 
Â 


I hate how they waited this long to show us The Onion Knight's bare hand.
I do like Hizdahr asking for a proper burial for his father.
However.. I will NOT be happy if the fighting pits don't get brought up.
They could always introduce it otherwise.. But the fighting pits were the reason Hizdahr came to see Dany in the books. We shall see.. We shall see.


Â 
I'm pretty sure they've shown us his hand before. Â On the way to the Blackwater, IIRC, when they are reminiscing about the siege where Davos ran food for Stannis.Â 
Â 
The vibe I got from Hizdahr is that he's going to be a frequent supplicant in Dany's throne room, always asking to restore various aspects of the "culture" of Meeren. Â First, he asks for something that's really hard to refuse - the right for him to bury own father in the manner of his choosing. Â Next, he'll come ask for something that's less personal to him. Â Maybe he'll come to ask for justice for the rest of the 162 families of the Masters. Â After all, he only got permission to bury his OWN dead. Â Then he'll come ask for something broader on behalf of all the Masters. Â It will go that way until he's outright asking for the fighting pits and slavery to be restored, and Dany will seriously be considering it because she's gone along with everything else. Â  I think he's going to be the death of a thousand cuts for Dany - little compromises that move the needle of her moral compass from black to gray. Â

Â 
Â 
What bothered me most about the Ramsay/Asha mess was (1)Ramsay's fighting bare-chested with no armor and not one Ironborn can do more than scratch his abs? Â Was it a fight scene or an attempt by the directors to show off Iwan Rheon's nice figure (which is easy on the eyes, but the character is so repellent that it doesn't matter to me, and besides, I thought one of the majorly hyped strengths of the show was gritty realism, not the exhibition of a preening sadist's buff torso)? Â (2)Asha just stands there, axe/daggers in hand while Ramsay chitchats with her for a minute or so before opening up the kennel to Release The Hounds - why wasn't that axe flying toward Ramsay's wrist before he turned the key into the kennel's lock? Â He certainly gave her time, and she didn't seem to be that far away from him, an attempt would have been nice, or at least expected from a fighter of Asha's supposed skill and experience. Â And even if TV-Asha didn't have an axe (can't remember), I'm pretty sure she at least had a knife and knew how to throw it.

Â 
My thoughts too. Dany clearly has no idea what the heck she's doing. Also, it's a little touch, but I think always having Missandei list her million titles accentuate this.
3079	Stormland's Fury	2014-05-12	Not nitpicking for this episode in particular, but why doesn't Stannis have any antlers on his clothing anymore? Both he and Renly had it in the beginning (maybe Robert too at some times) but they dropped that completely. Now he only wears his black or grey clothing.
3080	TyrionsFlagon	2014-05-12	The author = anyone? George R.R. Martin? Grayest of the gray means not saintly, quite the reverse. He's being portrayed as Ned II on the show, only smarter, and as Margaery pointed out, quite likely a better lover. Let me ask you the reverse, has he done anything wrong on the show, or if he has, has it actually been shown as wrong? Or is he just the victim of others.


Â 
NED II?!?!?! I mean I'm all for exaggerating, but geez.Â  I feel as though they've been pretty good about interpretting Tyrion, but then again I think that Book Tyrion isn't bad at all.
Â 
Tyrion is definitely a protagonist on the show, maybe not so much in the books. Maybe people who hate Book Tyrion are mad at the show for making him a protagonist, not necessarily white-washing him.

You can't surround somebody with whores (VERY FIRST EPISODE!!!) and call it white-washing.

I think they meant it that way.
3084	TyrionsFlagon	2014-05-12	Â He has been horribly whitewashed on the show. He's really the only character I think has been. Tyrion did a lot of fucked up things in the booksÂ that the show hasn't included.

I'm not really sure what they're referring to regarding book Tyrion, either.Â  I always thought he was a "good" character, myself.Â  He had a singer killed.Â Â The singerÂ was a friend of Shae and tried to blackmail Tyrion regarding their relationship.Â  So Tyrion had Bronn kill him.Â  Other than that, I can't think of any particular harm he's ever inflicted on anyone.

Â 
I think the major arguments have been that the portrayal of his relationship with Shae and his relationship with Sansa make him more sympathetic, especially given how his wedding night was portrayed in the books (granted, Sophie Turner was under 18 during S3 filming, so they may have wanted to have it be the same but simply couldn't).

I agree with this. The same as I didn't see the crucifixion scene as a "fist-pump moment". They are showing Dany's darker side.
I didn't like the Ironborn raid, either. The Ramsay sex scene was pointless. Alfie's acting was good though.

Tywin seems also to be more popular in the show than in the books (mainly because of Charles Dance), so I wonder what effect Tyrion offing him on the crapper will have on the show-only audience.

3093	BassChamber	2014-05-12	Dreadfort was a mess. Shirtless Ramsay fighting armored and shielded ironborns, Yara staring at him doing nothing when he shows the key, ironborns teleporting out of the Dreadfort... embarrassing. We want realism, not another dumb LOTR copy.
3094	Raksha 2014	2014-05-12	People need to come to grips with the fact that show Tyrion will not be the monster they interpret him to be in the books. Fine by me.Â 
Â 
That speech was awesome. I felt like he sort of figured he would have some sort of a fighting chance before the trial started, and by the end realized what a farce it was.Â 


Â 
Â 
I never felt that Tyrion was a complete monster in the books; what's especially tragic and moving about book-Tyrion is that in temperament and mind, he is possibly the best of Tywin's children and the most promising Lannister at the beginning of the story, and then the viciousness and uber-arrogance lurking in Tywin's family history rise in him too and we see more and more of Tywin in him, when perhaps Tyrion could have been a good and great man if he had had Ned Stark for a father. Â 
Â 
What might have jarred some book-savvy watchers of the show was the seeming suddenness of TV-Tyrion's descent into darkness during the trial last night. Â TV-Tyrion has been so heavily packaged as Saint Tyrion of the Thousand Merry Quips that his transformation into a wild, roaring anti-Lannister Lion could seem like it comes out of nowhere. Â But when you recall that Tyrion has been scorned and discounted his entire life for something he could not help, and now is not only on trial for his life for crimes he has not committed and is suddenly savaged and mocked by a woman he loved and thought was safely sent far away from harm, as well as the horror of his own father seeming determined to condemn him to death, after Tyrion had tried, in his own way, to do the right, and even honorable thing (defend King's Landing, not kill or hurt ghastly Joffrey, be kind to the younger children of the sister who hated him, be loyal to a father who has despised him his entire life, etc.), the breaking of TV-Tyrion's self-control seems long overdue and credible rather than sudden/unbelievable....at least to me. Â 
Â 
Even Sibel Kikelli managed some acting chops; Â her angry stare at Tyrion when she repeated the line about being just a whore said it all; whether or not she had been at all coerced, she was turning on Tyrion with intimate, spicy details because she wanted payback, and throwing Sansa to the lions as well.
Â 
It didn't hurt that Peter Dinklage and Charles Dance are first-caliber actors, either. Â I felt that this was the first appearance of future kinslayer Tyrion and ADWD Tyrion; and noticed that even Tywin seemed shocked (as well as furious) at Tyrion's outburst. Â Watch out, Old Lion, the spitting cub has become a very angry lion himself.

Tywin seems also to be more popular in the show than in the books (mainly because of Charles Dance), so I wonder what effect Tyrion offing him on the crapper will have on the show-only audience.


Â 
He's "popular" in that he's a ruthless badass...but still, all the audience has seen him do is scheme and verbally abuse his own children and excuse all of his machinations in the name of family. Â It will be a huge loss for the show though, because Dance is so good and such an nice anchor.
3096	Le Cygne	2014-05-12	Links please?I thought it was cool that so many objected, even those who are not Sansa fans. Some things are just important. Someone kept saying she knelt in the books, but she never did kneel for his cloak, he had to stand on the back of a fool to force her to accept his. And this meant a lot to Sansa:It was not supposed to be this way. She had dreamed of her wedding a thousand times, and always she had pictured how her betrothed would stand behind her tall and strong, sweep the cloak of his protection over her shoulders, and tenderly kiss her cheek as he leaned forward to fasten the clasp.Here are the nitpick threads from 3x08 and 3x10:http://asoiaf.wester...t-repercussion/http://asoiaf.wester...t-repercussion/

Yeah agreed, but he's still popular and many people don't even that distinction. It's more about a popular character killing another popular character, likability (as in being sympathetic) isn't really a factor.

Yeah, next year is the year the show will falter if it does...because they've gotten rid of SO many really vibrant well liked characters--Robb and Cat, Tywin, soon to be Oberyn, and at least to me, the new set of characters that replace them are not nearly as compelling. Â Jon Connington? Yeah whatever. Â Crazy Greyjoys. Â Whatever. Â The Martells, don't even get me started. Â And a lot of the fan favorite pairings will also be gone..

Haha yeah. I already expressed these concerns, as in the books we get some build up and/or are familiar with all those families or characters one way or another. But in the show they basically switch a huge chunk of the cast with new characters. Works ok in the books but on TV that's another matter. King's Landing soon becomes void of many major characters (that small council), focus switches to Essos and even established families like the Lannisters or Starks are disjointed or went through a lot of character development. The Northerners will join Stannis but even they haven't been fleshed out in the show as they have in the books.

Â 
I do worry about the show's ratings in the next year or two, after they finish up the ASOS material. Â If they smoosh AFFC/ADWD together, or draw it out, there are still going to more D&D improv scenes, and the best-written parts of GRRM's saga will have been already been done, and even if GRRM knocks it out of the park again with TWOW, it might be 2 years of AFFC/ADWD mishmash before the show reaches that, and without great material, and without many of the most vibrant characters and conflicts (Joffrey, Tywin, Cat, Robb, Lysa, the Hound, etc.), I'm not sure that the show will continue to provide the compelling storytelling we've seen this season, much less the ratings needed to sustain it for the long haul.

Â 
Yeah will probably be the last episode.Â  But yeah I am unsure how a dragon nibbles around the bones so as to able for the father to show her the bones.Â  Unless said father followed Drogon around waiting him to poop.
Â 
Could have easily beaten the kid to death in a drunken range, when he sobered up her burnt the body, collected the bones to get some money out of it.Â  Its possible.Â  But I guess it doesn't really matter in terms of the story.


Hmm, I was more thinking along the lines of the Sons staging the attack (probably taking the goat herders other children as hostages). As a result, Dany took her dragons out of the game and voilA  Yunkai had a shot at winning the war.

3107	Dragon's Bane	2014-05-12	In the books, the goat herds were most likely paid a price for their animals that was far too low. Remember, they all were pretty unhappy with the payment. But obviously Show!Dany pays them five-hundred thousand times the price just to show how benevolent she is...
Â 
Also the Dreadfort scene was just dreadful.
3108	Cas Stark	2014-05-12	Â

Â 
I didn't think it worked that well in the books, LOL, but also some book arcs, especially Bran's are not good TV, and nothing much happens with Sansa either. Â I do think that's probably why they got Dormer for Marg...because at least there will be Cersei and Marg left in KL so they would want an actress who was charismatic and could keep the audience interested.
Â 
Maisie seems to be able to do a great buddy charisma with whomever she is paired with so maybe we will get a slightly different type of kindly man or something.
Â 
This is partly also why I believe they need Manderley, to keep up hope for Team Stark and provide some audience continuity. Â And also Lady Dustin for the Theon at Winterfell stuff.
Â 
They're also going to have to hit it out of the park in casting Young Griff.
Â 
Oh and if anyone is counting, I still think Daario II is worse than the not very good Daario I. Â I don't know why anyone ever thought this actor had any sexual charisma?
3109	Addam Velaryon	2014-05-12	I thought the dragon scene was confusing.Â  It was quite unclear who the dragon burned.Â  The camera is focused on the boy the whole scene.Â  Then the guy drops some nondescript bones on the floor.Â 
Â 
I think they were trying to keep it vague until the guy said goat, but it didn't work that well.


Â 
the dragon clearly flew right over that boy, & they even showed it in slow-mo (how could some of you miss this?) It's obvious that this scene is a set up so that when the supplicant goat-herder does show up with Hazzea's bones the audience will know ahead of time that the dragons don't eat people, & if they do in fact fry someone it's on accident. The bones were clearly of a goat who got scorched in the process of Drogon hunting.
3110	Le Cygne	2014-05-12	People need to come to grips with the fact that show Tyrion will not be the monster they interpret him to be in the books. Fine by me.It's not a matter of how anyone interprets things, present the material, and we can all interpret it as we please. But they aren't doing that, they are whitewashing him - removing the negative material, even changing it to positive. Which shows that they interpreted it as negative, or they wouldn't have done so. It's deliberate.

Â 
You're forgetting that she had days to consider this marriage and a pep talk from Tyrion claiming that he didn't want this wedding either. In the books she had only minutess to process being married to a Lannister, and she didn't know Tyrion at all. That's why the kneel did happen in the show. It would not have made sense in the show's context to have her be defiant. Joffery and others were laughing at Tyrion, and what was she going to do? Humor Joffery? Come on.... Not to mention we can't hear Sansa's thinking (unfortunately), and it would have not been received as sympathetic. Even from the people who do not love Tyrion the best.Â

Â 
I think that's the key here, some things simply don't work on TV. Storm of Swords was a climax in the books and then it was back to build-up for two books again, the drama is not constant, which is essential in a TV-show, or at least you need established characters. It really depends how they will do it but I assume a lot of book 4+5 will be condensed (because of the timeline alone) to keep the conflicts going.

Yeah, I know right. D&D are horrible, they just feel this urge to blackwash Dany at any occasion! What kind of an unexperienced newby pays three times the price for burned goats? Soon, her throneroom will be packed with herders who burned their own sheeps in the hope for such a generous compensation!!! She's going to ruin her economy! All because of one fucking goat!

3116	JesterX	2014-05-12	I really don't like that the show has turned Mace Tyrrell into an order-taking buffoon for Tywin.Â  He doesn't get a lot of pages in the book but this guy is the Lord of the second most powerful family in Westeros.Â  Ok, we know Olenna has power too but even the show references that it was Mace's idea to support Renly over her objections.Â  And they proceeded with Margaery marrying Joffrey becase MACE insisted onÂ Margaery being Queen.Â  This guy is not a buffoon.Â  He wouldn't tolerate Tywin ordering to "fetch his quill and parchment".
Â 
Also, what was Tywin writing anyway?Â  Message to Dany?
3117	solidviper	2014-05-12	^ Maybe, but I like the change because it defied Joffery. Joffery was way too excited to have Tyrion be embarrassed. Anyone who thinks Tyrion should have been embarrassed is about as bad as Joffery in that scenario.Â 
Â 
The only way I would've accepted it if they had portrayed Tyrion as a Winterfell hungry creeper (like Petyr).
3118	Dornish Whine	2014-05-12	Also, what was Tywin writing anyway?Â  Message to Dany?Yeah, this one puzzled me as well. I am wondering if the show is going to somehow blame Tywin for the locusts...
3119	Cas Stark	2014-05-12	This is a true nitpick. Â But, apparently, Ramsay's dogs are more ferocious than direwolves, since they are in metal cages and biting the metal [and cause the Ironborn to run away], and poor ole Ghost can't even get out of a wooden pen.
3120	Stormland's Fury	2014-05-12	STOP SAYING COUNTRY USE KINGDOM GODF*CKING DAMNIT !!

Asha/Yara referred to the flayed Ironborn as countrymen.

Â 
I'm with you on that. I hated the Ramsay scene last night.Â
3122	Miodrag	2014-05-12	He has been horribly whitewashed on the show. He's really the only character I think has been. Tyrion did a lot of fucked up things in the booksÂ that the show hasn't included.


Â 
If that's whitewashing, then, truth be told, majority of the main characters have been whitewashed, since numerous "fucked up things" removed from their arcs (while at the same time, few of the characters were turned into mindless morons, Jon most of all probably). In short, vast majority of the characters was cleansed of complexity. In the case of Tyrion, his "whitewashing" is the most obvious, because he is the star of the show and his screen-time is disproportionately increased, but he's definitely not the only one who has been whitewashed.
Â 
This cleansing of his complexity ruined TV Tyrion for me, because he bores me in the show, which is the total opposite of the effect he has on me in the books, but, honestly, no TV character is nearly a match to his/her book origin, mostly because of the same reason.
3123	Le Cygne	2014-05-12	Oh and if anyone is counting, I still think Daario II is worse than the not very good Daario I. Â I don't know why anyone ever thought this actor had any sexual charisma?I was a big fan of Daario I, but Daario II is quite attractive, IMHO, and it seems like that opinion is shared by a good number of viewers. I don't think it's the actor's fault. I think for some reason, they are holding him back. I do think Daario will play a part in TWOW, I think there's genuine love between Dany and Daario, or at the very least, they still have a story to play out between them. Maybe they think if he comes off as a nice guy we will like him, but I would like him better if he was cocky, like he's supposed to be. Then again, I liked him in the books, too.

Â

The problem is they cut off the Tyrell family. People don't realise Mace actually cared for all his children and even give his crippled heir Highgarden, while finding lands and titles for the rest. Imagine if Tyrion was a Tyrell instead of a Lannister or a Tarly.
3125	JesterX	2014-05-12	This is a true nitpick. Â But, apparently, Ramsay's dogs are more ferocious than direwolves, since they are in metal cages and biting the metal [and cause the Ironborn to run away], and poor ole Ghost can't even get out of a wooden pen.

I'm wondering if Ramsay might've ordered Theon to go into the cageÂ with the dogs and that disgusted Yara/Asha enough to make her leave.

Â 
I don't see it. Â He's "attractive" but he should be "hot" and he should have tons of charisma no matter what look they're going for, and to me, he doesn't. Â I look at him and see Red Shirt. Â 
Â 
Daario I had the right swagger and I liked the crazy 80s glam metal hair, it would have been better if he was a better actor, but still much preferable to brown haired red shirt.

Yeah agreed, but he's still popular and many people don't even that distinction. It's more about a popular character killing another popular character, likability (as in being sympathetic) isn't really a factor.


Â 
Also, not a lot of TV characters kill their own fathers, no matter what the circumstances are. It doesn't happen that often in movies either, expect for a couple of Shakespeare's works. Its not something people are used to seeing, and I think it will be incredibly jarring for the audience. Couple that with killing Shae as well, and I think a lot of people are going to be seeing Tyrion in a different light after the season is over; regardless of whether he is cruel to Jaime on his way out or not.
Â 
Â 
On a different note, I thought it was clear that the goat scene was foreshadowing a future scene where a goatherd comes in with a bag, Dany dismissively tells him to take his money (with the implication she's done this several times and is bored with ti), and he reveals the bones of a child. The scene was fine by me.
Â 
My nitpick is with the Dreadfort scene. I understand why Yara left, but the whole thing felt rushed, anti-climatic, and unnecessary all at the same time. If D&D wanted her to leave the isles for a while (possibly so that when she comes back, its revealed that Balon's dead and Euron is sitting on the throne; thus skipping the Kingsmoot), it would've made more sense for just be sitting at Moat Callin. They even could've still had her meet Theon when he comes as an envoy, if that meeting was something they wanted this season. There could've been some plotline where she's struggling to keep the men in line, because that swamp sucks; Theon then comes, and the men want to surrender. She doesn't, but is overruled, and flees with a few trusted men back to isles where the remainder stay, open the gates, and are butchered.

If he was directed to turn on the charm, he'd be doing what you want to see, he knows how to act, I've seen him in other things.At any rate, they've made him a regular next season, he's not going away.
3130	ohpooratlas	2014-05-12	My only real issue was all the stuff at the Dreadfort. The acting was absolutely superb, but everything with Asha seemed utterly pointless.
Â 
And I'm pretty sure the dragons will still kill a child because she has to eventually lock up her dragons. It'll probably be at the end of the season though.
3131	coppersam	2014-05-12	Just a few minor nitpicks:
Â 
(1) I know this sounds stupid, but I found the "previously, on GoT" scenes annoying (are they the same for all viewers?). Â I hated how they went through and showed past disagreements between Tyrion and the witnesses that were going to testify against him one by one. Â It made it very obvious what was going to happen during the episode. Â Yes, I read the books, and I knew what was coming anyway, but my unsullied girlfriend knew what was coming too just from those scenes! Â 
Â 
(2) Â Scene where Ramsay draws Theon a bath- Reek, who has been tortured and beaten for quite a while now, who is too scared to even recognize a rescue attempt by his sister, still has a very toned and muscular physique? Â Ummmm..... Â This really bothered me. Â He looked like he is still strong and could be a physical force if he tried. Â Obviously the show isn't going to knock out his teeth and chop off fingers, but the visual of Reek in this episode was disappointing to me. Â I'm not saying there needs to be a Christian Bale in the Machinist kind of transformation, but if he still look like he did in season one with his shirt off, at least keep his shirt on! Â (Edit- I want to be clear that I thought Alfie did a fantastic job. Â No nitpicking him at all)
Â 
(3) Hunting hounds can for sure outrun some ironborn on foot. Â Do they expect us to believe that Ramsay didnt let those dogs out of the cages?? Â Weak. Â I didnt mind the scene in that it shows Theon's complete transformation into Reek, but the execution of this rescue scene was very poor. Â

3136	~DarkHorse~	2014-05-12	Naked Ramsay is not a nice thing to see. I dont care how cut he is, no! NOPE! NOPE! I have a feeling that that girl he keeps slammin' might wind up as Fake Arya.....just a thought...
Â 


Â 
Â I was hoping that bitch would be killed this episode. I really don't like the idea of Ramsay having an evil sidekick, especially oneÂ mainly used to provide boobs. Fake Arya should be a victim, not an evil slut...Jon needs to hear about the abuse of his 'sister'. Although, I have a feeling you might be right on this one, it's too late to remind us who Jeyne is and they won't want to use an underage (one in pilot) and sacrifice nudity being used.
Â 
Â 


Stannis didn't even get to speak his case. Seems Cogman has agreed to D&D propaganda.Â 
Asha-Dreadfort plotline totally useless.Â 


Â 
Sadly, Stannis is the third wheel of his own story. Â 
Â 
Mel and Davos are the likable/interesting ones, Stannis is just the mopingÂ jerk who needs those two to do everything for him and he doesn'tÂ even appreciate it.Â 
Â 
They better not screw with his Jon interactions.

3150	Ankou	2014-05-12	I'm just glad they didn't show his ruined crotch area. I still say it's possible, as I argued back when we only had the books, that he didn't actually lose it and it's that trick I've heard about last in Africa where people had a mania that shamans stole their penises. The mental domination to do that would theoretically be more interesting and impressive to Ramsay. Until they show it I still say we don't know!

3151	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-05-12	- As was said already, the whole Asha thing was several levels of awful, so I won't repeat it. I'll just say that I hate how they turned Asha into Badass Stoic Chick TMÂ instead of the charismatic and sassy character from the books. Also, I find Ramsey's voice annoying as fuck
Â 
- Stannis was a literal prop
Â 
- Although I think he's funny, making Mace play fetch with Tywin crossed the line. Every other episode Tywin talks about how much they need the Tyrells and then he goes and offends the lord of Highgarden.Â 
Â 
- Varys (and Oberyn!) pretty much going "Yes, yes, the Targaryen girl is a serious threat". Those two were the last people who should be saying that shit, considering Dany is an essential part of their plans
Â 
- And a definition of nitpick: I don't like Stannis' red sails because they look too much like the Lannister colors
3152	Miodrag	2014-05-12	Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d bet Asha fucked her way out of this adaptation. To have your name removed from subplots that are as stupid as this â<U+0080><U+009C>attack on Dreadfortâ<U+0080><U+009D> is, now, that has to be the biggest reward a book character can ever hope for.
Â 
Did Davos tell the bankers anything they didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know already? Other than his cut fingers, not at all. But, they changed their minds after his little speech nevertheless. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s one of the most ridiculous tropes in movie/TV storytelling, so GOT is hardly the first show ever to depict someoneâ<U+0080><U+0099>s change of heart so unrealistically, but it was still lame.
Â 
Also lame was bankerâ<U+0080><U+0099>s manners. If youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re a banker, you just donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t insult your potential costumers. â<U+0080><U+009C>Not counting those ships at the bottom of the Blackwater Bayâ<U+0080><U+009D>? What kind of a line is that? What banker would ever say something like that? Is that the best D&D can do in portraying oneâ<U+0080><U+0099>s cold and calculative mind? Seems like it is, because they did the same thing with The Spice King in season 2.
Â 
In â<U+0080><U+009C>Inside the episodeâ<U+0080><U+009D> video, D&D said theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re fascinated with the very concept of a bank in a high-fantasy, and they wanted to flesh it some more. With using worn-out tropes&clichA©s and heavy-handed dialogues that last fro a couple of minutes?! Really?! Do yourself a favor, D&D: next time you want to flesh something out, just donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t. (Unless itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a brothel. Brothels always need fleshing out. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s TV, after all.)
Â 
Dincklage did overact Tyrionâ<U+0080><U+0099>s rage, but I guess he had to, because itâ<U+0080><U+0099>d be anticlimactic otherwise, thanks to 1) all the simplification of Tyrion, and 2) ludicrous â<U+0080><U+009C>love storyâ<U+0080><U+009D> between him and Shae. About that second one, itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s hard to believe someone actually came up with the idea of a whore who in the name of love refuses diamonds that would make her a rich woman, only to push the man she supposedly loves to his grave later on.
Â 
And, how is Dany â<U+0080><U+009C>whitewashedâ<U+0080><U+009D> in this episode? She punished slavemasters; the only slavemaster weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve seen so far is much more sympathetic than in the books; and on top of that, he and his family could possibly be the innocent victims of Danyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s penal system; how does that make her â<U+0080><U+009C>whitewashedâ<U+0080><U+009D>, please? (On a side note, Hyzdhar is not a very realistic character here: â<U+0080><U+009C>My queen, youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re very beautiful, and this pyramid is beautiful, and my father built it. My father?! Huh, I thought youâ<U+0080><U+0099>d never ask. Well, heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s dead! And yes, you killed him.â<U+0080><U+009D> So lame.)
Â 
By the way, the episode was way better than the rest of the season so far.
3153	Stormland's Fury	2014-05-12	Â 
- And a definition of nitpick: I don't like Stannis' red sails because they look too much like the Lannister colors


Â 
Yeah that was really off-putting for me as well.
3154	Sand11751	2014-05-12	Back to the goat. If I were a goat herder, I'd set up a nice racket: burn one goat every couple of weeks, bring it to Dany and she'll keep giving me three times the value of "my lost flock" - seriously, how long before the other goat herders catch on?Â
3155	Veltigar	2014-05-12	Also lame was bankerâ<U+0080><U+0099>s manners. If youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re a banker, you just donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t insult your potential costumers. â<U+0080><U+009C>Not counting those ships at the bottom of the Blackwater Bayâ<U+0080><U+009D>? What kind of a line is that? What banker would ever say something like that?Â 


Actually, that was the most realistic line of the whole encounter. Stannis isn't there with a large sum of money he'd like to invest somewhere. The IBB has all the cards and they know it. And when it comes to giving money, bankers are hard as nails, especially when someone appears to be a poor investment like Stannis.
Â 
The rest of the encounter was unrealistic and cliche, but not that line.

3156	Cas Stark	2014-05-12	I'm not sure about the casting of Tychos, but I liked the IB set and this is a change that makes sense for TV, giving the viewer the visual of the super imposing rich as hell bank itself, this is the kind of change that makes sense. Â But, as usual, their handling of the change is a bit wobbly with Stannis showing up and doing nothing to advocate for himself.
3157	Colonel Green	2014-05-12	Also lame was bankerâ<U+0080><U+0099>s manners.

Both the Iron bankers and the Spice King are people who aren't seeking anything from the people they're having an audience with -- Dany has nothing to offer the Spice King, as he points out, and Stannis has nothing in particular to offer the Iron Bank either (they clearly took the meeting as a courtesy, before Davos persuaded them otherwise).
3158	Rapsie	2014-05-12	i asked you a simple question i was not trying to be offensive i was merely curious, The show and the books are entirely different entities, and finally up until ADWD i did not find anything wrong with Tyrion that was why i was asking a question.

It might be worth checking out the Re-reading Tyrion thread http://asoiaf.wester...n/#entry3600156 
On a first read it is very easy to completely sympathise with him, but on further re-reads his status as an unreliable narrator becomes much clearer. 
But some example from the show:
Removed: 
Breaking Marillion's fingers because Marillion mocked him (something Tyrion likes doing to others)
Rewrote his relationship with Shae cutting out the domestic violence
Removed his threats to rape Tommen
Removed poisoning Cersei
Removed the murder of the singer
Removed his vows made in bad faith to the Starks
Removed his mocking of Loras about Renly
Etc, etc, etc
On top of that they have added to his saintlyness:
He wants Ned's sword returned
He has no women issues
Concerned about Pod
Concerned about Sansa
Puts Shae's safety ahead of his own desires
Other characters talk him up: even Robb and Cat were no longer upset by the forced marriage
Etc

Â 
Have to disagree. It's one thing to more-less politely refuse a request; that's what bankers do all the time. It's something else to insult an applicant. There's no need for that. In fact, the cold, calculative logic would suggest exactly the opposite: this is someone who may be a client one day, so why insult him?!
3160	boojam	2014-05-12	The negotiation between Jamie and Tywin is quite clever, something, as our moderators point out, GRRM could have thought of.My question is, and it's never explained, why does a loss or really a draw in this case, in trial by combat, mean one is really guilty?Tyrion does not really confess , he just antagonizes everybody.The King could still send him take the black.Yeah, I know that's not a good option.After all "It's good to be the King."

It comes down to who dies first.Â  Oberyn is comprehensively dead.Â  The Mountain is not (and lives for some time later, in agony).

Â 
But I never understood how book-Tywin, powerful as he was, could have gotten away with sending Tyrion to the Wall if Tyrion was convicted of regicide. Â The deliberate murder of a king, particularly a king who happened to be his nephew, is a Big Deal, and it happened at said king's wedding, not during the breaking of a siege (i.e. another Lannister slaying a king). Â Wouldn't it have undercut the prestige of the de facto Lannister monarchy if the officially convicted murderer or a Lannister king was allowed to live?

3164	JonInVa	2014-05-12	The show is actually following the book for once, it was a common thing for herders and the like to present the bones of their livestock for reimbursement before the situation with the child. I'm sure they will have the human bones presented to her at some point, although as others have said it is never really confirmed that Drogon did it in the first place.



I was thinking the same thing. The way the herders eyes lit up when he heard "three times their worth" made me think for split second (this is immoral 7 Kingdoms after all) that he saw $$$$ with one of his "human" kids.
3165	W1NT3RF3LL	2014-05-12	No Giant of a Lannister lines & it is used so much in the books-perfect for TV
Think Asha is so poorly cast- 1 of my favorite book characters
No way she could get to Dreadfort.  Why? Just stupid & Asha wasn't. She & her storyline constantly evolve in the books
Brilliant acting & camera work in this ep. Pretty damn good this weekmeh, it was a way to possibly set up ashara getting captured by stannis.  She is no longer on the islands and is now on land.  It was also another way to get to the reek story of him becoming theon again but pretending to be.  It was nicely setup.i see why they did it.

Â 
Joffrey isn't a Lannister king, though, he is a Baratheon no matter how big the lion is on his coat of arms.Â  Tyrion, however, is a Lannister.Â  One could argue letting a Lannister escape the death penalty for the murder of a Baratheon king only furthers the House.
Â 
The book does a better job by having Kevan say (from memory), "If you weren't his son, do you think he'd make this offer?"Â  Anyone else would have been thrown under the bus, but no matter what else Tywin thought ofÂ  his son, he would never throw a Lannister to wolves.
Â 
Hence, why he was so eager for a confession.Â  It would have given him the excuse he needed for the act of clemency.
3167	Pod The Impaler	2014-05-12	Â 
Well I assumed Varys has manyÂ  little birds across narrow sea, its not a secret Jorah and Barristan are on her council it would be known in the conquered city I guess.
Â 


Â 
Â 
Unless those birds can fly back and forth at the speed of an airliner, I do not find it credible. It is not that they couldn't discover this, but the time it should take to report anything over such long distances.
Â 
Â 
Â 


Â 
Dany prefers whatever men she prefers. It's not a crazy character change


Â 
Â 
It is. Daario is a flashy douchebag in the books, and everyone except Dany can see it.
And if you want to argue GRRM would not throw that scenario at us, I can cut you off with three words: "Sansa wuvs Joffrey".
Â 
Â 
Â 

And really, it's all symptomatic of the show painting itself into a corner in the first place with this storyline.Â  Theon can't get rescued and Asha can't get captured and Ramsay can't be the one to run away because it's his home field.
Â 
At least Asha got to fuck a couple people up with AxeHusband.Â  Finally.


Â 
Â 
Yeah. That's why I was really surprised that it was not settled by Roose Bolton arriving on the scene with 100 more men, and then Asha Yara would know she could never escape with that and with Theon actively resisting her. That would have been a way to escape the painted corner, where Yara at least gets to keep some dignity. Not just a shirtless loony with a pack of dogs.
Â 
He could have taken her hostage? She could have taken him hostage just as easily.Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 


Not nitpicking for this episode in particular, but why doesn't Stannis have any antlers on his clothing anymore? Both he and Renly had it in the beginning (maybe Robert too at some times) but they dropped that completely. Now he only wears his black or grey clothing.


Â 
Â 
In-show explanation: In Braavos, flamboyant styles are worn by commoners, and black is the colour of nobles and important folks only. (Actually true, if one checks the books.)
Â 
Real world explanation: limited resources for costuming.

They gave upon the stag outfit some time ago and I don't really see why Stannis of all people changes outfits so often (even weirder since it also means to craft new ones production-wise). Robb didn't even change outfits until the RW.
3170	Nictarion	2014-05-12	@Pod
Comparing Daario to Joffrey is way off. Daario may be boastful, and dress like a peacock, but he isn't a sadistic little shit like Joffrey. Daario actually does seem to care about Dany somewhat. And his advice (except the RW) has been pretty good. I can see why some would think he's a douche (I don't), but he's not even in the same league as Joffrey.
3171	direwoofwoof	2014-05-12	Yeah time to be salty ol jerks and seethe about junk you dont like.Â 
Â 
I got one real big nitpick with this episode. That fucking goat. RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGE!!! If the show doesnt eventually have that guy come back with the bones of his kid, im going to riot. Seriously. Im really mad about that. Snapping mad. Its incredibly important that the dragons nom on a human. Its the whole reason Dany locks up her dragons come on!  Fix it, show! FIX. IT.
Â 
Â 


Â 
The goat is just an appetizer for the main course... little boy
3172	Mad Monkey	2014-05-12	If the IB is loaning money to both Stannis and Tommen, wouldn't they be out any money they give to the loser? If Stannis dies the Throne won't really want to pay off debts that he incurred to fight against them, right?

Barristan shot her a look when she said that.Â 
ETA: She even wonders if people are cheating her in the books. Her or one of her councilors mention the possibility.Â 


Â 
Dany is well aware that some compensation claims will be false, but she believes (in my view, correctly) that the dragons are eating so many livestock that it would be more damaging to her public image to reject all claims than it would be to approve all of them. To ameliorate the risk she has people making claims swear a holy oath before the gods of Ghis, which might discourage at least a few people from lying.

Â 
I thought in the books it was more like Stannis overtook the Throne's standing debts as well, because Cersei stopped paying them. The show is much weirder about it since the Lannisters still pay and Tywin is still alive.

Yes, but did they give Stannis in the show a separate loan or completely accepted him as king and thus made Robert's loan also his? It makes no sense since Cersei hasn't even refused anything yet. If it's a not a separate one then Cersei will have nothing to refuse in the first place.
Â 
The reason they approached Stannis in the books was because they didn't get any money from the IT.

I assume they gave him a loan contingent on him paying back everything the IT owes, which is premature since the IT is still paying them back. Â They were right the first time, when they said it was premature to do anything w/Stannis...while Tywin is alive and they're being paid. Â 
Â 
D&D are simply not good at plot continuity and logic. Â They can throw a great scene together, but they can't keep the dots connected.

It would be a hilarious level of whitewashing if they have Cersei stop paying because she finds out the IB loaned money to Stannis..

I'm not quite sure why, but I did as well.
I'm also not sure whether this warrants me therapy or not.
3181	NymTargaryen	2014-05-12	I am getting increasingly pissed off at the "instant news flash from across the sea" stuff.Â 
Â 
"Daenerys has 8032 Unsullied, the Second Sons, 3 dragons, Jorah and Barristan Selmy are with her too. Oh, and she is sitting on a series of 5 different pillows when she receives supplicants, and shifts them around once per hour."
"How do you know that - is Jorah still spying for the Iron Throne?"
"No. Not for a long time now."
"THEN HOW, VARYS ? SERIOUSLY. ARE YOU GETTING THIS INFORMATION BY SHIP OR A LIVE WEBCAM STREAM GLASS CANDLE?!"

I thought about that as well. Could it be Missandei?
3182	Stormland's Fury	2014-05-12	I thought about that as well. Could it be Missandei?


Â 
Maybe his head acts as a crystal ball.
3183	Florina Laufeyson	2014-05-12	I thought about that as well. Could it be Missandei?


The amount of awesome that would be, is incredible. Im going to file that crackpottery away for later.
Â 
Â 


Â 
I'm not quite sure why, but I did as well.
I'm also not sure whether this warrants me therapy or not.


Something tells me that Alfie's junk was untampered with and thats why we got the "maybe a peek....NOPE!" shot. Ramsay givin' the googly eye to it was just creepy.Â
3184	Colonel Green	2014-05-12	Something tells me that Alfie's junk was untampered with and thats why we got the "maybe a peek....NOPE!" shot.


They could CGI his junk out of the shot.
3185	Florina Laufeyson	2014-05-12	They could CGI his junk out of the shot.


Did you guys really want to see CGI mangled junk?
3186	Stormland's Fury	2014-05-12	Did you guys really want to see CGI mangled junk? 


Â 
One of the dragons would end up on the cutting floor though.
3187	Salad Days Saan	2014-05-12	Â 
Yeah. That's why I was really surprised that it was not settled by Roose Bolton arriving on the scene with 100 more men, and then Asha Yara would know she could never escape with that and with Theon actively resisting her. That would have been a way to escape the painted corner, where Yara at least gets to keep some dignity. Not just a shirtless loony with a pack of dogs.
Â 
He could have taken her hostage? She could have taken him hostage just as easily.Â 


Â 
Yup Yup.Â  I mean, I'm left to infer/assume that happened, but they should've shown that, or at least had Ramsay say something along those lines.Â  "Hear those alarm bells?Â  How long do you think you've got until my dad wakes up with the rest of our men and traps you here?"Â  Or have one of her own men point out they're running out of time because the reinforcements are coming [and maybe even have that guy turn out to either be Tristifer or Qarl, or even a pastiche thereof? ]
Â 
It also would've been a good move because The Roose has yet to truly Get Loose this season and that is, of course, highly disappointing 
Â 
Now, MAYBE they can salvage a little bit by having The Roose show up next week and bitch Ramsay out for having such lax security and/or having to bail him out.Â  "Hold your tongue, bastard, as far as I can tell that so-called "Iron Bitch" had you cornered until I showed up to bail you out.Â  You're not my son, you're my liability."Â  Or something like that.
Â 
After all, Roose's leverage on Ramsay is that Ramsay still craves paternal approval, and if Roose can throw that at him and take the wind out of Ramsay's sails after Ramsay thinks he's SO CLEVER for using Reek to get Moat Cailin to surrender, then he's still got Ramsay somewhat under control (and he'll take his frustration out on Reek again.Â  Or maybe Myranda)
Â 
But without making it clear that Asha had run out of time and had to retreat to save herself, yup, the Ironborn just got tarred with the Jabroni brush and that don't easily come off.
Â 
Â 
Also now that other people mention it, it is a little annoying that we get the IB ready to back Stannis BEFORE Cersei tells them to gtfo she's not paying you back.Â  Sequence is important here and would more clearly illustrate how the Iron Bank operates.Â  "oh, Cersei, you say fuck us?Â  Nah nah, fuck YOU, we're putting Stannis back on track to whip your ass, have fun!"
Â 
HOWEVER, I'm willing to look the other way since this way we got a scene with Salladhor Saan

3188	PatrickStormborn	2014-05-12	And, how is Dany â<U+0080><U+009C>whitewashedâ<U+0080><U+009D> in this episode? She punished slavemasters; the only slavemaster weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve seen so far is much more sympathetic than in the books; and on top of that, he and his family could possibly be the innocent victims of Danyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s penal system; how does that make her â<U+0080><U+009C>whitewashedâ<U+0080><U+009D>, please? (On a side note, Hyzdhar is not a very realistic character here: â<U+0080><U+009C>My queen, youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re very beautiful, and this pyramid is beautiful, and my father built it. My father?! Huh, I thought youâ<U+0080><U+0099>d never ask. Well, heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s dead! And yes, you killed him.â<U+0080><U+009D> So lame.)


Â 
Just wanted to add here that in the first episode Missandei told Dany that 1000 slaves died building the Great Pyramid. Would have been nice to see Dany make that connection to remind Hizdahr (and the audience) that his father was still not innocent, even if he didn't condone murdering the slave children. Again, they make it look like Dany just doesn't thinkÂ (when, in reality, it's because the writers are the ones failing to make connections in their own writing).
Â 
As it stands, it looks like D&D took the wrong message from Dany's crucifixions. The problem, really, is not that some of them may have been innocent (that's obviously a problem, but Dany never truly punishes them FOR the crime itself anyway); the main problem is that it was ineffective. It provoked the Great Masters without significantly weakening them. She should have punished all of them, or punished none of them.Â

3189	Lord Damian	2014-05-12	Ramsay does not strike me as a brave character in the books, he is a bully who is blustering when he has all the cards. The Dreadfort scene was rediculouse
3190	Colonel Green	2014-05-12	Ramsay does not strike me as a brave character in the books, he is a bully who is blustering when he has all the cards. The Dreadfort scene was rediculouse


Whatever else might be said about them, he's quite forward in battle.
3191	Fat Trell	2014-05-12	Re-watched the episode today. Realized I love the court scene a lot, and that I hate the Iron Bank scene.
Â 
First off, we again have Stannis being useless. He alreadyÂ isn't good at military stuff, sucks at politics(canon),Â is a religious fanatic, and is a shit friend.Â Lets add weak-willed to list. He gives up on what is a pretty desperate plan to begin with early, and needs DavosÂ to trumpet his ability. He, once again, needs either Davos or Melisandre to plan and enactÂ any action he takes.Â 
Â 
But my bigger issue is the Iron Bank itself. The Iron Bank has no reason to think Tywin won't repay them. Even if they are aware of his Gold Mines running dry, he now commands an entire continent. He can tax. He has access to the Tyrell's personal resources as well. On the surface, even under the surface, the 7 Kingdoms are unifying. They aren't slipping into further chaos. Supporting Stannis is absolutely ludicrous. Â 
Â 
Even if they find Tywin's successors less than adequate, why assume he'sÂ going to die? And why assume anyone would be dumb enough to not repay them?Â And why not first try to establish this fact before choosing to back a candidate to the throne who not only has long odds, but apparently has no plan to improve these prospects?
Â 
And why would an emotional speech that further reinforces the fact that Stannis inspires little love, change these facts? Banks don't run on emotion, businesses don't run on emotion. What makes the Iron Bank interesting is their alieness to the setting. They aren't scorned lords or vengeance minded royalty; they're businessmen. TheyÂ make money. With no scruples or thoughts to the rightness or honor of their clients.Â 
Â 
The Iron Bank certainly isn't behaving like a bank playing realpolitik. They're behaving like spectators looking for a compelling man to back.
Â 
Not to mention this utterly removes Cersei's already whitewashed misstep next season. The Iron Bank will now support Stannis not because she made a mistake, but because they didn't trust a women to pay the debts of her bankrupt husband and disappointing father.

3192	Ankou	2014-05-12	They could CGI his junk out of the shot.


Woah woah woah, do they have that kind of budget hiding all that junk?
3193	Nami	2014-05-12	I really didn't like how Varys reported about Daenerys at the counsel meeting.Â 
Â 
Whatever his true agenda might be, heÂ definitely doesn't want the 7 kingdoms to unite and prepare for an invasion. But this is exactly what he does, when he portrays Daenerys as a danger that has to be taken seriously.
Â 
In the books, he's more like "Some sailors talked about seeing a kraken on the shore, in Qarth there's talk of dragons, and beyond the wall they claim to have seen some snarks as well"
But on the show, he gives a detailed report about Daenerys' strength. He talks about her three dragons, and when Cersei waves it off "Three small dragons..." he responds that they're growing every year. Actively making them more cautious, where they would remain oblivious if he just kept his mouth shut.


Â 

I can't get over that. It's like everyone knows there's a Targ with three freaking dragons and it's totally ok and they're keeping calm about it, when in season 1 they were quite freaked out that Dany was pregnant.Â  Also, it's been mentioned for some time about the dragons and Cersei is like "it's just three baby dragons" like they just got the news they were born, when they knew already way before that. Is Cersei just showing her stupid or is it fail writing? I can't even tell anymore.
If I remember correctly, in the books, the three dragons are just rumours and no one actually believes it.
Â 
God is such a bad writing. They have no idea

Also its Cersei being stupid. Tywin takes note of it but tries to pass it off as not much. (probably to not have the council freak out.) Oberyn's jimmies were rustled by those reports and Varys' findings on Dany's resources.Â

3195	Baltan	2014-05-12	I really enjoyed this episode, but there are certain things that nagged me.
Â 
The thing that bothered me most is Asha reaching the Dreadfort by sea... Maybe I missed something, but the Dreadfort is not near the coast (not even in the show maps we see at the beginning), and even if it is, it's on opposite coast of Westeros. Did she go around the whole continent so fast?
And if she truly wanted to rescue Theon, she could have just knocked him out and drag him 
Of course it's a filler story, with really no point but showing us that Theon is a wreck.
Â 
The other is the persistence of linking Oberyn and Ellaria to brothels. Come on! We got the idea already: they enjoy sex! You have one of the most interesting characters reduced to his adventures in a brothel.
Â 
And finally, the passiveness of Stannis. Davos saved the day (as usual).
3196	Duron Qel-Droma	2014-05-12	I have a minor catch: In Braavos, Tycho Nestoris says, that Tommen is "Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm". But at Tyrions trial Tommen himself says that Tywin is indeed the "protector of the Realm". So I think Tycho was wrong here? Or was he just using Tommen's full title in analogy of Stannis, being named "protector of the Realm" by Davos?
3197	Colonel Green	2014-05-12	The thing that bothered me most is Asha reaching the Dreadfort by sea... Maybe I missed something, but the Dreadfort is not near the coast (not even in the show maps we see at the beginning), and even if it is, it's on opposite coast of Westeros. Did she go around the whole continent so fast?


The Dreadfort is on the Weeping Water, a river that flows into the Shivering Sea.
Â 
Yes, Yara sailed around the continent.Â  She said that was what she was going to do in 3.10.

Â 
Well, I did missed that. Thank you for pointing that out.
3199	Miodrag	2014-05-12	Just wanted to add here that in the first episode Missandei told Dany that 1000 slaves died building the Great Pyramid. Would have been nice to see Dany make that connection to remind Hizdahr (and the audience) that his father was still not innocent, even if he didn't condone murdering the slave children. Again, they make it look like Dany just doesn't thinkÂ (when, in reality, it's because the writers are the ones failing to make connections in their own writing).
Â 
As it stands, it looks like D&D took the wrong message from Dany's crucifixions. The problem, really, is not that some of them may have been innocent (that's obviously a problem, but Dany never truly punishes them FOR the crime itself anyway); the main problem is that it was ineffective. It provoked the Great Masters without significantly weakening them. She should have punished all of them, or punished none of them.Â 


Â 
To tell you the truth, I don't blame Dany for crucifying those masters. She's removing the foundation of their lifestyle, their basic worldview, the pillar of their culture - the notion that by their birth they're better than other people. That is the essence of the most oppressive systems in history: one group of people is considered superior (and, simultaneously, some other group is considered inferior) simply because. Fighting a system rooted in such an oppression is never easy, and, practically, it's mutually exclusive with moral absolutism. Whoever thinks it's possible to overthrow such a system with a clean hands, is wrong. In Martin's world, just like in the period of human history Martin modeled his world after, slavery could've been overthrown only by force, e.g. a war. And if you fight a war, some innocent blood will be spilled. Will it outweigh the benefit is another matter, but there's no place for moral absolutism there. In short, each and every one of those masters Dany crucified was guilty of something pretty serious. Of course, not all of them were equally guilty and not everyone of them deserved the same punishment, but, if slavery is the indictment - and it is a serious charge - then not a single one of them was innocent. Under different system, some of those people wouldn't become villains. Under different circumstances, Dany wouldn't kill them all. Against some other opponent, Dany would possibly be the villain for what she did. But, this is not a different system, and these are not different circumstances. With her goal and her enemy, I think Dany's doing quite fine. Actually, in her shoes, I don't think I'd be as tolerant as she is.
Â 
But, regardless of what I think, it's obvious how complex an issue Dany's mission is. And Martin's very aware of it. He makes her confused before the complexity - just like any sane and normal and well-intended person would be. It's one thing to sit behind the computer and theorize about Dany's missteps or heroics, but it's quite another to fight actual and grave injustice of epic proportions. Now, to take that issue, and to boil it down to simplistic, irrelevant arguments a la "I just want to bury my father", that is one of the rare instances I can't help but think about how superior books are to the show. I usually don't need such comparisons, because the show is usually illogical or inconsistent or whatever on its own. But this, with Dany's war on slavery, this is something that can't be discussed without referring to the books.
Â 
If there is another story that so effectively and thoroughly and analytically depicts a fight against an oppression, I surely don't know of it. Nothing on this scale and of this nature ever happened in actual history, so only a fantasy story could tell such a tale. And, as far as I know, no fantasy story ever so much as attempted at anything similar, let alone pulled it. If I'm right, Dany's war on slavery is a unique story in many ways. And now there's an adaptation of it. Meaning, it's only natural to compare that adaptation to its source material. Littlefinger's and Varys' conspiracies and Cersei's coup and Arya's vengeance and Northern rebellion with RW and all the other story-lines of ASOIAF, while great, aren't as unique as Dany's is, and they can be measured against other stories. But Dany's war on slavery is, for better or worse, in a league of its own. And, judging by the first steps (the last two episodes), this adaptation is going to be a huge failure. She had like two scenes in liberated Meereeen, and both were sub-par, suffering from moral simplification - one thing that can make this story practically unwatchable.
Â 
I'm aware many readers dislike Dany's ADWD chapters. Hope nobody would mind, but I happen to think that, in most cases, that is because of some misplaced expectation that Dany should already be in Westeros. Or, possibly, because of Tyrion's and Quentyn's ADWD chapters, people had enough of Essoss. But, for adaptation, her stay in Meereen is a gem. It's one great dialogue after another, one impossible choice after another, one difficult decision after another - all the elements of great drama are there in abundance. While tricky in terms of production, when it comes to writing, Dany's ADWD chapters are as adaptable as anything in ASOIAF. But, if D&D continue down the road they seem to be taking (total neglect of the context), it's really going to be unwatchable.
3200	Salad Days Saan	2014-05-12	Yeah, the more Salla, the better to be honest.
Â 
Also its Cersei being stupid. Tywin takes note of it but tries to pass it off as not much. (probably to not have the council freak out.) Oberyn's jimmies were rustled by those reports and Varys' findings on Dany's resources.Â 


Â 
Varys is probably presenting Dany as a serious threat to the council in order to gauge the new council (first meeting of Tommen's reign!) and the new council members.Â  Tywin, Cersei, and Pycelle are known quantities to him at this point, of course, but he really owes it to himself to get a read on what Oberyn and Mace are going to be like as council members as soon as possible.
Â 
Now he knows.Â  Oberyn knows his shit when it comes to Essos (but he's possibly Targ-sympathetic, which is rather new for Varys when it comes to other council members).Â  And Mace is just gonna get the coffee for whoever else is actually in charge  so he's on Varys' "keeper" list of schmucks who'll keep this nation nice and soft and ripe for invasion.
3201	Mad Monkey	2014-05-12	Â 
Stormland's Fury, on 12 May 2014 - 4:45 PM, said:
Â 
I thought in the books it was more like Stannis overtook the Throne's standing debts as well, because Cersei stopped paying them. The show is much weirder about it since the Lannisters still pay and Tywin is still alive.
Â 
Â 
That works for Stannis but not the other way around. If Stannis wins, OK, he will pay off his own loan plus everything that Robert, Joffrey, and Tommen incurred. If the Lannisters win though, are they going to want to payoff the loans that Stannis incurred trying to overthrow them? That seems like it would an unreasonable request even from the Iron Bank.
Â 
"Daenerys has 8032 Unsullied, the Second Sons, 3 dragons, Jorah and Barristan Selmy are with her too. Oh, and she is sitting on a series of 5 different pillows when she receives supplicants, and shifts them around once per hour."
Â 
Apart from the pillow thing (which I'll admit was a stretch) none of these events would be hard to discover. Varys already knows that Jorah and Barristan are there. The Unsullied thing has to have been big news because it involved the collapse of Astapor; the fall of a major city, which would have taken place months ago now, would undoubtedly be talked about. The dragons too are renowned throughout the world -- this information even came to attention of Joffrey. The only bit that's a little fuzzy is the Second Sons, but even that's not exactly a secret since they went over to her during the siege of Yunkai.
Â 
Varys does have some improbable information but knowing about major political events like the fall of a major city and the presence of two prominent Westerosi noblemen (that he himself dispatched to Dany) aren't exactly leaps of insight.
3202	Le Cygne	2014-05-12	The other is the persistence of linking Oberyn and Ellaria to brothels. Come on! We got the idea already: they enjoy sex! You have one of the most interesting characters reduced to his adventures in a brothel.


Â 
Hedonism.Â  He doesn't even want to get up in the morning.Â  How does he stay so fit.Â  Oh, wait...
3203	Stormland's Fury	2014-05-12	Â 
That works for Stannis but not the other way around. If Stannis wins, OK, he will pay off his own loan plus everything that Robert, Joffrey, and Tommen incurred. If the Lannisters win though, are they going to want to payoff the loans that Stannis incurred trying to overthrow them? That seems like it would an unreasonable request even from the Iron Bank.
Â 


Â 
Are you referring to the books or the show? If you're talking about the books, they approached Stannis because he was the only king willing to pay and who was still in the game. If you're talking about the show we basically agree since it doesn't make any sense either way.

Yes Ash & you will receive
3207	ladyinblack	2014-05-12	Btw.  @Sour Robin. Your recap  of the last episode was great. Did you do one for this show
Oh, to keep on topic, I find it disturbing that Ramsay has a female playmate on the show. In the books, he did not seem capable of this kind of relationship
3208	Emperoreddy	2014-05-12	This felt like the first time Dany hasn't been whitewashed. Her naive black and white viewpoint of justice was seriously flawed and she was called on it. My thought is this is just going to continue and get piled on her, and thats why Drogon killing a child (if he even did it, which is up in the air) will happen and take her down further.
Â 
Dreadfort scene is my only nitpick and maybe not for the reasons other have. I am fine if they wanted to change Yara's storyline. Have her captured early, or have a small adventure with Theon before losing him, or whatever. THIS makes no sense though if all this getting her to the north was for her to give up this quickly and go back to Pyke. THAT is pointless in my mind. Rather have the Moot without her then for her to go back and just be "back on track"
3209	Florina Laufeyson	2014-05-12	Â 
Varys is probably presenting Dany as a serious threat to the council in order to gauge the new council (first meeting of Tommen's reign!) and the new council members.Â  Tywin, Cersei, and Pycelle are known quantities to him at this point, of course, but he really owes it to himself to get a read on what Oberyn and Mace are going to be like as council members as soon as possible.

Yeah. Varys is sort of wondering if Oberyn's got his hand in the Targ cookie jar. Varys is weighing Oberyn and how useful he could be for the upcoming invasion tactic. I dont think at this point, Varys has any idea that Oberyn would wind up squished like a fruit.Â So hes wondering how to use that to his advantage but also letting Oberyn know that theres shit flying elsewhere. I liked the discussion between the two. Sets up for Aegon, and kinda makes viewers hope that these two conspire together and stuff. Varys is probably thinking of using Aegon as a key to securing Oberyn's loyalty to that cause. "Your sister's son did not die..."

They should have used "one ship carrying the fookin' legend of Gin Alley" before the BROWN PANTS punchline. That's my Saan nitpick.Â
3211	Jairion Lannister	2014-05-12	The whole Ironborn plot seemed a bit random and pointless in the end. I'm guessing they won't just head back home, although Yara/Asha giving up on Theon so easily after travelling halfway across the continent to save him seemed weird. She knew in advance he'd been tortured. Did she expect him to be the same arrogant boy he'd been before or something?
3212	Salad Days Saan	2014-05-12	Btw. @Sour Robin. Your recap of the last episode was great. Did you do one for this show
Oh, to keep on topic, I find it disturbing that Ramsay has a female playmate on the show. In the books, he did not seem capable of this kind of relationship


Â 
Yes but I usually do them right after the HBO broadcast of the episode, which means I'm posting in that thread at the same time that EVERYONE ELSE is posting their initial reactions in that thread, so it quickly gets buried ten pages back as the thread balloons from 14 pages to 20.Â  You can always click on my name and Search Users Posts to browse my content.Â  It's fine, I like having my fragile ego massaged 
Â 
As for Ramsay's playmate... first, minor nitpick:Â  I don't like her being named Myranda because that most likely means Myranda Royce Will Not Exist In The Show.Â  And I like her.
Â 
second:Â  you don't really think Ramsay's capable of this sort of relationship for long, do you?Â Â  Remember how the other Dreadette ended up.Â  Ramsay is A Big Kid, throwing away his old toys when he gets a new toy, like Sweetrobin only a whole fuck of a lot worse because, well, duh.Â  There will be a love triangle again, and Myranda will be the old toy that time, and the odd one out when jealousy rears its ugly head again.
Â 
And Ramsay has totally done this several times before and poor Myranda thinks she's special when she's really just the latest in line.Â  "If they'll cheat WITH you, they'll cheat ON you too" as the old saying goes.
3213	Ankou	2014-05-12	Yeah but he may have to stick with her because how often do you find a sadistic psycho chick? Oh nevermind.Â
3214	Florina Laufeyson	2014-05-12	Poor Myranda.  Her time as Queen Dreadette is going to come to a close. Ill be sad. Im really warming up to her.Â 
Â 


Yeah but he may have to stick with her because how often do you find a sadistic psycho chick? Oh nevermind.Â 


Harumph. <.<
3215	Hath4	2014-05-12	well there are alot of people who believe that actually Myrannda was killed by ramsay last night, but it was cut from the epiosde. It would explain the blood on his chest when he enters the kennels, plus in the very first trailer myrannda slaps ramsay yet we did not see that last night so some of the scene was cut. Plus it doesnt feel out of charcter, because myrannda is also pychotic and enjoys sadism. she is not the normal girI so IÂ  could see him keeping around a girl that shares his sadist mindset. Ramsay gravitates toÂ  those that enjoy the things he does. ie being a pycho and a sadist.

I assumed that blood was from guys he mangled before getting to Asha. /shrug
3219	Ankou	2014-05-12	I assumed that blood was from guys he mangled before getting to Asha. /shrug


It definitely looked like scratches on himself, I assumed it was from sex.Â
3220	Hath4	2014-05-12	we know that there was more to the ramsay and myrannda sex scene sense in the first trailer we see her slap him, and we did not see that last night, only time will tell on if she was killed but that was cut. Intersting last nights epsiode clocked in at 49 minutes, two short of what it was supose to be 51 minutes. some are speculating that they cut out myranda being killed due to the sept controversy.
3221	Ankou	2014-05-12	That'd be a bummer.

^its likely. If Myranda wound up murdered, they could just have her not appear anymore and result in a quiet What Happened To The Mouse situation.Â
3223	Wilhite	2014-05-12	I wonder if they wanted people to think Theon was actually killed for a little while. Â  You gotta think that they axe murdered those dogs, right? Â Correct me if I'm wrong but it didn't even seem like they were running when it abruptly cut to the "My brother is dead" part.
3224	TheBlackViper	2014-05-12	Not really a nitpick, but did anyone else notice that, during the small council meeting, Oberyn was wearing his sun and spear robe and, immediately after, he's talking to Varys with different clothes? And then he's back in the sun and spear for the trial?
3225	eumaies	2014-05-12	Also the Iron Bank would have never thrown in with Stannis at this point, imo.
Tywin is alive. Despite all his personal failings and dickishness, he is viewed as reliable. Tywin's whole image is about competence; ruthless, bitter competence. The idea that he wouldn't have found a way to pay the IT debts(heh) is underminding. Even with the ridiculous dry gold mines.
Even ignoring Tywin though, Stannis is a losing horse at this point. No heartfelt speech from Davos about how great a guy Stann is should have changed the mind's of these near fanatical bankers.


Exactly.Â  Was a shame.
Â 
A sensible speech might have been one about funding Stannis as an insurance fund, or setting up previously that Tywin was temporarily stiffing the iron bank.Â  Lots of missed opportunities in this episode.
3226	eumaies	2014-05-12	Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d bet Asha fucked her way out of this adaptation. To have your name removed from subplots that are as stupid as this â<U+0080><U+009C>attack on Dreadfortâ<U+0080><U+009D> is, now, that has to be the biggest reward a book character can ever hope for.
Â 
Did Davos tell the bankers anything they didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know already? Other than his cut fingers, not at all. But, they changed their minds after his little speech nevertheless. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s one of the most ridiculous tropes in movie/TV storytelling, so GOT is hardly the first show ever to depict someoneâ<U+0080><U+0099>s change of heart so unrealistically, but it was still lame.
Â 
Also lame was bankerâ<U+0080><U+0099>s manners. If youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re a banker, you just donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t insult your potential costumers. â<U+0080><U+009C>Not counting those ships at the bottom of the Blackwater Bayâ<U+0080><U+009D>? What kind of a line is that? What banker would ever say something like that? Is that the best D&D can do in portraying oneâ<U+0080><U+0099>s cold and calculative mind? Seems like it is, because they did the same thing with The Spice King in season 2.
Â 
In â<U+0080><U+009C>Inside the episodeâ<U+0080><U+009D> video, D&D said theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re fascinated with the very concept of a bank in a high-fantasy, and they wanted to flesh it some more. With using worn-out tropes&clichA©s and heavy-handed dialogues that last fro a couple of minutes?! Really?! Do yourself a favor, D&D: next time you want to flesh something out, just donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t. (Unless itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a brothel. Brothels always need fleshing out. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s TV, after all.)
Â 
Dincklage did overact Tyrionâ<U+0080><U+0099>s rage, but I guess he had to, because itâ<U+0080><U+0099>d be anticlimactic otherwise, thanks to 1) all the simplification of Tyrion, and 2) ludicrous â<U+0080><U+009C>love storyâ<U+0080><U+009D> between him and Shae. About that second one, itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s hard to believe someone actually came up with the idea of a whore who in the name of love refuses diamonds that would make her a rich woman, only to push the man she supposedly loves to his grave later on.
Â 
And, how is Dany â<U+0080><U+009C>whitewashedâ<U+0080><U+009D> in this episode? She punished slavemasters; the only slavemaster weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve seen so far is much more sympathetic than in the books; and on top of that, he and his family could possibly be the innocent victims of Danyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s penal system; how does that make her â<U+0080><U+009C>whitewashedâ<U+0080><U+009D>, please? (On a side note, Hyzdhar is not a very realistic character here: â<U+0080><U+009C>My queen, youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re very beautiful, and this pyramid is beautiful, and my father built it. My father?! Huh, I thought youâ<U+0080><U+0099>d never ask. Well, heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s dead! And yes, you killed him.â<U+0080><U+009D> So lame.)
Â 
By the way, the episode was way better than the rest of the season so far.


Thank you for saying all this so that I don't have to.
3227	Gneisenau	2014-05-12	Good thing Asha ain't in GoT because she would have thrown an axe at Ramsay and killed him.
3228	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-05-12	Good thing Asha ain't in GoT because she would have thrown an axe at Ramsay and killed him.


Â 
Asha wouldn't have even attempted that lame rescue
3229	Nictarion	2014-05-12	We did get some Asha axe throwing though, that was about the only good part of that scene.
3230	Ororo727 Jon Snow Fangirl	2014-05-13	I thought it was lame that the Bastard wasn't injured after all of that fighting, without armor, especially after the scene with Dog lecturing Arya about the need for armor.
3231	Stormland's Fury	2014-05-13	I thought it was lame that the Bastard wasn't injured after all of that fighting, without armor, especially after the scene with Dog lecturing Arya about the need for armor.


Â 
And it's Ramsay. They could show him getting injured but that would him only make him more enthusiastic or something. Like he would just smile gleefully and then kill the other one.Â
3232	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-13	I am getting increasingly pissed off at the "instant news flash from across the sea" stuff.Â 
Â 
"Daenerys has 8032 Unsullied, the Second Sons, 3 dragons, Jorah and Barristan Selmy are with her too. Oh, and she is sitting on a series of 5 different pillows when she receives supplicants, and shifts them around once per hour."
"How do you know that - is Jorah still spying for the Iron Throne?"
"No. Not for a long time now."
"THEN HOW, VARYS ? SERIOUSLY. ARE YOU GETTING THIS INFORMATION BY SHIP OR A LIVE WEBCAM STREAM GLASS CANDLE?!"

Varys could be lying. He could have another spy (interesting if true as then he may have one in the books too). Or it could genuinely be a glass candle!
3233	Domonju	2014-05-13	I'm wondering when Jorah will finally betray Dany. In the books he's already out of favor at this point, no?
Â 
I don't think they were whitewashing Dany's character with the goat bones. They need to set up the fact that she is paying three times the price to goatherds. So the next time we see this we'll probably get a scene which is closer to the books with a few goatherds bringing in scorched bones, followed by the girl bone reveal.
3234	SlowLoras	2014-05-13	Well, the Dreadfort thing was a horrible clusterfuck, wasn't it? I was so excited for it in the run-up - non book-derivative 'filler' is fine by me if it's well done but....it really wasn't. At all. Let me count the ways:
Â 
1) AshYara's rousing speech...great by itself, I'm thinking 'hell yeah, AshYara's gonna kick some Dreadfort ass, let's see the Ironborn in action'. Meanwhile, Ramsey's having bizarrely soft-lit sex with some bird, eyes a-twinklin'. She cuts a dude's throat. Awesome! This is what it's all about. But then Ramsey appears, shirtless and bloody - presumably he's hacked Loud Orgasm Girl to pieces or something?
Â 
2) Shirtless! I get Ramsey's mildly insane but he turned up for battle shirtless!?? He had time to find weapons but not a shirt? I'm pretty chill when it comes to this show and I let a lot of things slide because I'm here for the fun of it. But my suspension-of-disbelief button just would't function here. You're telling me Ramsey SnowBolton launches himself into the middle of a pack of Ironborn, in a narrow passageway, throws himself about shirtless while armoured, shieldbearing men with big fuck off weapons surround him and not one scratch? Not one?
Â 
3) Speaking of that fight, when the Iron Islanders are fighting Ramsey's men, why don't a few of them gang up on SHIRTLESS, VULNERABLE Ramsey and do him in nice and quick? They have shields! They have armour! Ramsey has pasty flesh! It's a no-brainer! The entire fight scene was teeth-grindingly infuriating and completely unbelievable. Are they setting up Ramsey as some invincible, insane supervillain? Are we entering the comic book realm? Are we supposed to be rooting for him? He's charismatic as all hellÂ but he also tortures and flays people for the lolz.
Â 
4) I can't remember the exact quote,Â but in the book it says something along the lines of 'if Asha was going to die, she would die with a smile on her lips and an axe in each hand'. So they successfully take down most of Ramsey's men (but not Ramsey? The most vulnerable man there??) Then he releases the hounds. Now, I get that dogs are vicious and terrifying and I can understand beating a retreat but surely not without a fight? Again, these guys have armour, big weapons, and there weren't that many dogs. Are we supposed to believe they didn't at least attempt to fight them off before leaving without Theon, which was the sole reason they went there in the first place?
Â 
(and yes, I get that Theon's batshit, I get that he's teetering on the edge of full-on Stockholm Syndrome, but I just don't buy that AshYara wouldn't have forcibly rescued him anyway. He's weak and frail, hardly able to fight, and I'm pretty sure the Ironborn are no strangers to carting people off.)
Â 
5) He let her go. Just like that. Didn't appear to be any great chase happening. Seems quite OOC for Ramsey. But they ran, and nobody seemed to follow, and...that was that. I can't see Daddy Roose approving of letting the potential heir to the Iron Islands go. Mind you, since the show has set up the Ironborn as being totally bloody ineffective in this episode, I guess SuperRamsey just didn't consider them a threat anymore...
Â 
Â 
Anyway, the whole thing really annoyed me. It made AshYara look weak, a poor planner and her men almost cowardly - if they can't even injure Mr Shirtless how good can they be? The whole thing was utterly pointless. They illustrated the depths of Theon's madness and despair far better in the bathtub scene than in this one (I thought Alfie Allen bordered on the hammy in the Dreadfort scene, whereas in the bathtub scene he was bloody magnificent - flinching from the washcloth like it might be a branding iron.) So what exactly was these scene supposed to illustrate other than 'hey, remember these dudes?' and 'wow isn't Ramsey a badass'.
Â 
Â 
*deep breath*
Â 
The rest of the episode was pretty great thought. I'm just glad I got me some Davos and Stannis action.

Â 
Ya, good breakdown.Â  Also, while he's taking the time to unlock the doggie pen, isn't that a great moment to rush him and bury an axe in his defenseless and armorless body? I believe what he's doing here is called lowering his guard?

Â 
It didn't even occur to them to just take Ramsay as a hostage to get out of the Dreadfort and have later political leverage on the Northern lord whose lands the Ironborn are occupying...
3237	Woman of War	2014-05-13	I have read the books and watched the show from the beginning, and there is a subset of people on this forum who don't like Dave and Dan's take on Tryion, it's goofy to me that they call it white washing, but Peter is a different Tyrion from the books.What I see is that Dan and Dave have taken Peter's personality and integrated it into his acting skills, as visual media he is , to my mind, a Tyrion with more dimensions than in the books, and that's fine with me.The horse has bolted the barn and some people won't let it go.

Good post
3238	The Drunkard	2014-05-13	Also lame was bankerâ<U+0080><U+0099>s manners.

Â 
 
Â 
I haven't liked a lot of what they've done with the Iron Bank. I wasn't a fan of Tywin's speech, and I'm not exactly a fan of the bankers flashing their power, making potential customers feel ill at ease, and, like you said, all but openly mocking them.
Â 
Book Tycho tried to be as accommodating as possible. He was the one that did the travelling, he styled whoever he met as they would wish it, he didn't do anything to prick their pride or past failings, he, as he put it, is always glad to be of service. That made sense, he wants as much business as possible, and we didn't need some rambling speech about the bank being an insurmountable temple that controls the world to get the point across that the bank was powerful, either.
3239	Rooseman	2014-05-13	I'm wondering when Jorah will finally betray Dany. In the books he's already out of favor at this point, no?


Â 
I think it was before they took Meereen, that they revealed Astan's true identity and Jorah's prior spy activity to Daenerys.
Â 
I'm guessing that they'll let her find it out this season, because in this episode they took the time to remind us that Jorah had been Varys' spy but wasn't any more.

Â 
It has to be before Meereen I think since Jorah was the one leading the group crawling through shit as a way to redeem himself.
3241	Queen of Whores	2014-05-13	I'm very annoyed that Jorah and Barristan are getting the Catelyn treatment - fascinating characters that are the most interesting in their storyline, yet are nothing more than props standing around wordlessly. They should be increasing Jorah's importance right now, in preparation of his eventual fate, not decreasing it.
3242	Lord Thornhart	2014-05-13	I understand that Bryan Cogman had to scale the wall that D&D wrote themselves into with their shitty fanfiction, and I think he did a really good job and I respect him for that, but it could have been so much better if he gave Ramsay real armor instead of plot armor.
3243	Natalia Borgia	2014-05-13	RE Ep 10:The Children.
Â 
Hmm could mean CoTF. Could mean Meereen kids. Could mean the children Dany can never bear.Â

Â 
They wrote themselves into a corner, yes, but there are a million more elegant ways to get out of there.
Â 
For example, very similar to what actually happened, but better: Sneak into the castle stealth-mode and kidnap Theon. They could manage to escape, but atÂ a very inconvenient moment, he starts screaming for help and alerting the guards - many guards, way too many to fight. Asha is forced to leave him behind and flee.
Â 
This would have gotten across everything that needed to come across, without a stupid fight scene, stupid shirtless Ramsay, stupid dogs, stupid awkward cuts that make no sense etc.

Â 
This pretty much. They could even have one Ironborn tell Yara that Theon is "gone" and then have them flee from reinforcements or something. Anything really.
3246	RedShirt47	2014-05-13	I join those griping about the Dreadfort scenes. They didn't really work well for me. Too rushed and the escape was a little too easy.
I liked the scenes at Craster's last week, I felt they worked quite well, added some action at a point where the season could have sagged. But the Dreadfort stuff just felt tacked on.
Â 
Otherwise it was a good episode.

Â 
That's a good point now that you mention it. Â Tycho was always underplaying everything he did, totally matter of fact, oh yeah, I found some people to take me through an insane Northern snowstorm to get here...no big deal, it's what I do. Â IB in the books is portrayed as very subtle.

Â 
Yeah, but here's the thing. Â If they are going to invent stupid non book stuff like Asha sailing around Westeros to get Theon, and then giving up in 5 minutes and leaving him alive to his fate.....
Â 
They can't invent some scenes with Ian Glen and instead he stands around in the background now and never gets any lines?

Â 
That's true. I don't understand why they don't flesh out the Essos stuff instead as it progresses at a slower pace than the Westeros story lines at this point. Instead of Yara we could have more Jorah or Barristan dialogue, connecting Dany a little more to Westeros again. Doesn't have to be much, juts little nods.
3253	Sam with Hooters	2014-05-13	Fez wrote Also, not a lot of TV characters kill their own fathers, no matter what the circumstances are. It doesn't happen that often in movies either, expect for a couple of Shakespeare's works. Its not something people are used to seeing, and I think it will be incredibly jarring for the audience.

What do you think about the theory that Ramsay killed Myranda and they cut the scene from the show, which is why it was so short and why the blood on him looks less like cuts from a sword fight and more like scratches or not even his own blood?

I'm guessing they put the POOL in that brothel to distinguish it from THE brothel?Â  I was sooooooooooooooo happy to see Sallador Saan (and have him say the word 'Dragonstone') that I'm willing to hold off on brothel nitpicking, for Braavos anyway.Â  By the way, that reminds me, WTF with Oberyn inviting Varys to THE brothel??Â  Honestly, are they trying to tell us that The Prince ofÂ Dorne doesn't have actual, you know, ROOMS in The Red Keep or at least somewhere on the castle property??Â  That pissed me off, even if he's stocking all of his rooms at THE brothel with Dornish wine.Â  WTF indeed?Â  That question, and the fact I have to ask such a question.......is a big, big, big nit.
Â 
As far as Ramsey and the girl, I'm behind on reading any theories on it, but that's an interesting idea.Â  I cannot believe that Myranda actually thinks she would live through any relationship with Ramsey.Â  I'll have to check out some of the posts, I'm behind on theories about the past two shows, but that is an interesting idea, him already having killed her.Â  I did read already someone suspecting that Myranda might be used as Fake Arya, but I kind of doubt they could pass her off as even younger than Sansa.Â  For all the mess of the Dreadfort scenes, I am so happy that
they didn't kill off their Yara/Fake Asha.Â  I was so worried about her status that I hadn't given much thought to The Bastard's Blood.Â 
Â 
~seven hells, I HATE this keyboard, and I'm curious to see, did your OG post to me even show up on this post (I can't find it), or not~Â  Sorry for the longer post.............between the keyboard and the fact I'm so behind on reading around here, I got carried away.Â  
Â 
ETA:Â  Looks like I need to figure out the settings and why the new computer is tampering with my ability to reply quote and actually show said quote I am replying to......this will be a mess til hubby comes home, I AM SURE.Â  Â

3260	Cas Stark	2014-05-13	LOL, I also thought 'come on by the brothel to see Ellaria' was strange, like, they sex addicts and can't be more than a few minutes from their next orgy? Â Ridiculous, but typical HBO, turn a hedonist with an unconventional attitude about sex into a sex freak.

Â 
This is my biggest issue.
Â 
Another small thing, but apparently the Prince of Dorne only has one outfit However, he wears it well so I can't complain too much.
3262	Sam with Hooters	2014-05-13	Resolving the discrepancies -- some crackpottery, just for fun.Â  No, I'm not quoting from everyone who's commented on these!Â  Credit where credit is due, of course.How did Davos know where to find Saan, or that he'd be in THAT particular brothel?.Â  This one's easy -- Mrs Saan told him when he dropped off the big chest o'gold.Â  We don't know that The Mrs objects to his frequenting brothels, after all.How can Yara be quoting Ramsay's letter when it was burned to ash?Â  Another easy one -- she transcribed it from memory, or at least as well as she could remember it.Â  Iron Islanders are sensitive to their reputations, after all -- those insults from Ramsay, and the tone, would've stuck.How is Varys getting accurate information so quickly from so far away without using magic?Â  We know he had (or has) at least one sorcerer prisoner.Â  We didn't SEE Varys kill him.Â  He could be forcing him to use magic to scry distant places.Â  Perhaps Varys' hatred of magic is all an act, a cover for his true activities, or maybe he could set his hatred aside in service to his Greater Cause.The biggie:Â  How could an unarmored Ramsay drive off fifty of the Ironborn's most skilled and seasoned warriors with two knives and a few normal dogs?Â  I think we can all agree this is an unlikely scenario at best...for a normal person.Â  Perhaps Ramsay is possessed by the Great Other, or some other supernatural entity, one that feeds on pain and fear and gives him some mesmerizing power over his victims.Â  A bit hokey, yes, but it's better than the huge freakin' plothole otherwise.How did the Ironborn escape?.Â  Well, Ramsay clearly gave Yara/Asha a fighting chance (no pun intended); he asked "How fast can you run?"Â  Presumably Super!Ramsay hunted the Ironborn and many of her warriors sacrificed themselves so she could escape.Â  Somehow the sound editors forgot to put "braying hounds" in while the Ironborn remnant fled to their river boats.Â  Once the IB return to their longboat(s), they'll have long discussions about how overwhelming and cruel Ramsay is and how he just can't beÂ an ordinary manÂ and how they'll need to bring Drowned God priests to face him next time.Â  Yeah, that's the ticket.Oberyn doesn't have rooms befitting his station in the Red Keep? He does but he prefers not to use them -- after all, Kings Landing spies are everywhere.Â  His men-at-arms are probably staying in them.Â  Presumably he had the brothel and its rooms checked for spyholes and other inconveniences.Â  Ellaria stays to guard the Dornish wine (after all, Oberyn CERTAINLY knows Westeros has some undetectable poisons!).Oberyn only has one outfit? I blatantly stole this solution from a DBZ board -- he has a dozen copies of the same outfit.Â  It's like the Prince's uniform or something.
Edited: Solved two new ones.Â  Yea, me!

3264	Miodrag	2014-05-13	Book Tycho tried to be as accommodating as possible. He was the one that did the travelling, he styled whoever he met as they would wish it, he didn't do anything to prick their pride or past failings, he, as he put it, is always glad to be of service. That made sense, he wants as much business as possible, and we didn't need some rambling speech about the bank being an insurmountable temple that controls the world to get the point across that the bank was powerful, either.


Â 
Completely agree. I mean, that is what bankers do. Even in our day and age, when they have infinitely more power than in Middle Ages, bankers are always trying to accommodate you, even if they're turning you down. The only people they're cruel to, are people that owe them money. That is why GRRM's version makes all the sense in the world: IT stopped paying debts, so IB naturally became interested in helping anyone against IT. The show version makes no sense at all. Neither the scene itself (insulting and mocking a potential client), nor their ultimate decision (to finance the man who's the biggest threat to IB's biggest investment in Westeros, e.g. The Iron Throne), has any logic whatsoever. It's as if D&D never dealt with any bank on any level in real life.
3265	'96Buck	2014-05-13	The whole 'raid on the Dreadfort' sequence was very clumsy. I don't know if it was the writing, or editing, or directing, or a combination of these, but it felt awkward and rushed. Why superimpose Yara's speech with Ramsay's sex? Why do a rush job of the actual infiltration? Why the odd cut between Yara running and her arriving at the boat? Dogs are faster than humans. You want me to believe Ramsay was bluffing and never let the dogs out? Why the writing inconsistency of Ramsay letting Yara go? The Reek stuff was great, though.
Â 
It was obviously set-up. Hilarious how some readers feel negative about this non-issue due to expectations and lack of insight.


Agree, and a tease to the book readers...we're all thinking "oh geez, is Drogon going to toast the girl right in front of us?Â  Please no, take a goat, take a goat, phew."Â  But we know it's just a respite.
3266	RhaenysBalerion	2014-05-13	I was surprised to see how many people rated this episode 10. I even rewatched to understand the enthusiasm, because watching for the first time I had to pause it a few times (you know, doorbell, popcorn, phone, people talking) which might have caused my feeling of lack of coherence. And indeed it felt a lot more whole for the second time. But my mind still wasn't quite blow.Â 
Â 
- I am just so tired of listening to why Stannis is the best guy in the world for chopping off Davos's knuckles. Davos had that monologue about 5 times already and it's getting pretty boring. Writing-wise, I'm surprised that a couple missing knuckles moved the Iron Bank. Other than that, I think their reluctance was somewhat realistic, after all Stannis is indeed in a pathetic situation. Their mentality reminded me a little bit of the Spice King who I liked a lot, so I didn't have the problem with the Iron Bank guys. But the Davos/Stannis side of the scene was just poor and boring.Â 
Â 
- I know, boob quota. Nothing wrong with that. I'm even petty enough to like Salladhor's pirate joke. But then Davos came and crashed the scene. I really like the Davos/Salladhor Saan bromance, much more than the Stannis/Davos one in truth, but I think this boob detour was very poorly linked to the Stannis plot line. First, because the dialogue with Davos was crap, and second because I can't believe Salladhor Saan is falling for this for the second time. WHAT does he see in supporting Stannis? Apart from Davos's frienship and promises...Â 
Â 
- I hate the Ironborn. It is known. But the Ironborn theme song is one of the best bloody soundtracks in the whole show, I have to give that to them. Point is, Asha, I mean Yara breaking in to the Dreadfort didn't make sense. Didn't make sense on the Theon end, didn't make sense on the Yara end, didn't make sense in the Ramsay end. His sister comes to his rescue and Theon goes Gollum on her...? What's that? 
	Spoiler  It purely suggests that Theon is absolutely beyond repair which is not quite so, khm, dance with dragons, khm. 
 From the Yara perspective: WHY not shoot those bloody dogs before they raised Ramsay? From Ramsay's: WHY let Yara and her men go? That scene just didn't make sense.Â 
Â 
- "I demand a trial by combat" Cool. So what? Showing everybody's shocked and stunned faces (great acting around, btw), music and Rains of Castamere ending almost did the trick and almost made me believe that this was an overly dramatic episode ending, but then, no, it wasn't. Tyrion already had a trial by combat back in the Vale and that wasn't a huge deal at all back then. So what changed? Why is this such a dramatic twist of events? I don't understand the hype around this sentence. No doubt, they made it very believable that this is supposed to be pretty dramatic, but why is it dramatic, pray?Â 
Â 
(- I miss Roose Bolton)Â
3267	Hangover of the Morning	2014-05-13	Probably already mentioned gazillion times but why did Yara and her pirates let unprotected Ramsay to turn his back on them and give him time to unlock all the cages. Must re-watch cause that scene made zero sense besides the obvious message that IBs are complete idiots.Â

Because 50 of the fiercest Ironborn warriors are afraid of a few puppies.

Â 
Yeah, you know, when that happened, it kind of made me feel like this. Because also, who didn't see this coming? But I think that's why they included Jaime brokering a deal...Tyrion did just blow up his best chance of survival. But its impact was also lost on me because I knew it was coming, and in the books, we knew Oberyn was willing to be his champion before he chose trial-by-combat.
Â 
Still, I think the "dramatic" part of it was his breakdown and his speech, which he completely nailed. And just how far he was willing to go to prevent his father from "winning" (in this case, sending him to the Wall).Â

First of all, AFAIK no one at the trial had seen Tyrion's previous use of this strategy at the Vale.Â  Plus, they were all expecting a standard confession -- "Yes, I killed Joffrey."Â  Tywin and Jaime's shock is understandable; Tywin always thinks he's in control, and Jaime was expecting Tywin to honor his word, which Tyrion just made impossible.Â  At least Tommen, even at such a tender age, had the sense to recuse himself from the whole mess (which begs the question:Â  wouldn't Tywin have been expected to recuse himself as well?Â  Is he really such a control freak that he wouldn't give up power even for one trial?Â  Doesn't he even care about the appearance of fairness, at least for the populace's sake?).
I hope the show will also clarify whether Sansa's guilt or innocence will be decided in absentia with Tyrion's.Â  At best she'd be considered an accomplice.
Or maybe what the crowd is *really* reacting to is Tyrion's hostile attitude towards them, i.e, "He really IS a vile scheming demon monkey!!".

Â 
At least in the big fight he was actually bother to put some armor on albeit looks just like some boiled leather and shoulder padding ... not that full plate would matter much if the mountain's great sword makes full contact.

Â 
He needs to be agile...how he fights best. Though at least in the books he has some steel.
Â 
The Red Viper was lightly armored; greaves, vambraces, gorget, spaulder, steel codpiece. Elsewise Oberyn was clad in supple leather and flowing silks. Over his byrnie he wore his scales of gleaming copper, but mail and scale together would not give him a quarter the protection of Gregorâ<U+0080><U+0099>s heavy plate. With its visor removed, the princeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s helm was effectively no better than a halfhelm, lacking even a nasal. His round steel shield was brightly polished, and showed the sun-and-spear in red gold, yellow gold, white gold, and copper
3274	Tormund GiantsMANE	2014-05-13	This felt like the first time Dany hasn't been whitewashed. Her naive black and white viewpoint of justice was seriously flawed and she was called on it. My thought is this is just going to continue and get piled on her, and thats why Drogon killing a child (if he even did it, which is up in the air) will happen and take her down further.
Â 
Dreadfort scene is my only nitpick and maybe not for the reasons other have. I am fine if they wanted to change Yara's storyline. Have her captured early, or have a small adventure with Theon before losing him, or whatever. THIS makes no sense though if all this getting her to the north was for her to give up this quickly and go back to Pyke. THAT is pointless in my mind. Rather have the Moot without her then for her to go back and just be "back on track"


Â 


Â 
Yes but I usually do them right after the HBO broadcast of the episode, which means I'm posting in that thread at the same time that EVERYONE ELSE is posting their initial reactions in that thread, so it quickly gets buried ten pages back as the thread balloons from 14 pages to 20.Â  You can always click on my name and Search Users Posts to browse my content.Â  It's fine, I like having my fragile ego massaged 
Â 
As for Ramsay's playmate... first, minor nitpick:Â  I don't like her being named Myranda because that most likely means Myranda Royce Will Not Exist In The Show.Â  And I like her.
Â 
second:Â  you don't really think Ramsay's capable of this sort of relationship for long, do you?Â Â  Remember how the other Dreadette ended up.Â  Ramsay is A Big Kid, throwing away his old toys when he gets a new toy, like Sweetrobin only a whole fuck of a lot worse because, well, duh.Â  There will be a love triangle again, and Myranda will be the old toy that time, and the odd one out when jealousy rears its ugly head again.
Â 
And Ramsay has totally done this several times before and poor Myranda thinks she's special when she's really just the latest in line.Â  "If they'll cheat WITH you, they'll cheat ON you too" as the old saying goes.


Ramsay's about to be made into an "honest man" 'Randa's got to go eventually.
3275	Tormund GiantsMANE	2014-05-13	We did get some Asha axe throwing though, that was about the only good part of that scene.


the first thing you see after the grappling hook hits the wall is her throwing ax
3276	Tormund GiantsMANE	2014-05-13	I get that people wanted Yara (in her completely new to us all arc) to attack the dreadfort and lay waste to all the baddies holed up in there, but i just don't think that was the plan. She took 50 of her best men on a covert op. You don't attack a place called THE DREADFORT with 50 guys....they were trying to slip in and slip out, and prolly could have if not for Theon's utter fear and whipped dog loyalty to Ramsay (the point of the entire scene). Either way I don't think at any point that dropping a bunch of Bolton men was the goal, it would have been more so a byproduct of the mission. Once Yara sees the mission is fruitless they bail....not out of fear, but out of lack of purpose. Similar to how she told him to leave Winterfell,not so much because the were scared, just becasue there was no purpose in it. %0 men against the whole force of the dreadfort once roused would be a massacre, and for what?Attacking the dreadfort to free a hostage is one thing......attacking the dreadfort and killing the warden of the north's only natural child is quite another. Her line about not having a brother anymore is a direct wink at what Balon said to end season 3.
3277	MyLittleDirewolf	2014-05-13	This is incredibly nitpicky, but Dany is not "first of her name", is she? There was another Daenerys Targaryen. Or does First of (his/her) Name only count if the person is a crowned king or queen?

Â 
Nor is she really a Khaleesi of the Green Dothraki Sea anymore.
Â 
To your question, I think your name only counts if you were an actual monarch and Dany is the first Targaryen queen, so even if there was a Daenerys before (which I think there was) she's still the first of her name.
3279	eumaies	2014-05-13	Â 
They wrote themselves into a corner, yes, but there are a million more elegant ways to get out of there.
Â 
For example, very similar to what actually happened, but better: Sneak into the castle stealth-mode and kidnap Theon. They could manage to escape, but atÂ a very inconvenient moment, he starts screaming for help and alerting the guards - many guards, way too many to fight. Asha is forced to leave him behind and flee.
Â 
This would have gotten across everything that needed to come across, without a stupid fight scene, stupid shirtless Ramsay, stupid dogs, stupid awkward cuts that make no sense etc.


Yeah it just scares me that there are really screenwriters so friggin stupid that they couldn't hire one intelligent person who would pre-read this crap (I'd do it for free!) and tell them where it falls apart.Â  But maybe they're just going for comic-book level intelligence. JJ Abrams-style GOT.
Â 
The one credit i give to the episode - the depiction of Tywin's manipulation of Jaime was invented and was very well done.Â  So they get maybe 1 out of 4 of their adaptations right.Â  Most of their inventions are just pure tripe.Â  And they claimed they aspired to make a show as intelligent as the Wire?Â  Dream on, D&D.

Â 
The first Daenerys was not a queen, so Dany is the "first of her name" to rule.
Â 


Â 
Nor is she really a Khaleesi of the Green Dothraki Sea anymore.
Â 
To your question, I think your name only counts if you were an actual monarch and Dany is the first Targaryen queen, so even if there was a Daenerys before (which I think there was) she's still the first of her name.

Â 
She still has a khalasar, which is why she styles herself Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea. But there are also hints throughout the books that she sees herself as Drogo's heir and would take back his khalasar if the opportunity presented itself ("I am Daenerys Stormborn ...Â khaleesiÂ to Drogo's riders" - ASoS, Daenerys IV).

Â 
Â 


Â 
To tell you the truth, I don't blame Dany for crucifying those masters. She's removing the foundation of their lifestyle, their basic worldview, the pillar of their culture - the notion that by their birth they're better than other people. That is the essence of the most oppressive systems in history: one group of people is considered superior (and, simultaneously, some other group is considered inferior) simply because. Fighting a system rooted in such an oppression is never easy, and, practically, it's mutually exclusive with moral absolutism. Whoever thinks it's possible to overthrow such a system with a clean hands, is wrong. In Martin's world, just like in the period of human history Martin modeled his world after, slavery could've been overthrown only by force, e.g. a war. And if you fight a war, some innocent blood will be spilled. Will it outweigh the benefit is another matter, but there's no place for moral absolutism there. In short, each and every one of those masters Dany crucified was guilty of something pretty serious. Of course, not all of them were equally guilty and not everyone of them deserved the same punishment, but, if slavery is the indictment - and it is a serious charge - then not a single one of them was innocent. Under different system, some of those people wouldn't become villains. Under different circumstances, Dany wouldn't kill them all. Against some other opponent, Dany would possibly be the villain for what she did. But, this is not a different system, and these are not different circumstances. With her goal and her enemy, I think Dany's doing quite fine. Actually, in her shoes, I don't think I'd be as tolerant as she is.
Â 
[Snipped for length]
Â 
I'm aware many readers dislike Dany's ADWD chapters. Hope nobody would mind, but I happen to think that, in most cases, that is because of some misplaced expectation that Dany shouldÂ alreadyÂ be in Westeros. Or, possibly, because of Tyrion's and Quentyn's ADWD chapters, people had enough of Essoss. But, for adaptation, her stay in Meereen is a gem. It's one great dialogue after another, one impossible choice after another, one difficult decision after another - all the elements of great drama are there in abundance. While tricky in terms of production, when it comes to writing, Dany's ADWD chapters are as adaptable as anything in ASOIAF. But, if D&D continue down the road they seem to be taking (total neglect of the context), it's really going to be unwatchable.

Â 
Fantastic post! Â I completely agree. I'm dreading how they handle Dany's future material - not just ADwD, but beyond that. I just can't imagine them being able to write for Daenerys after her epiphany in the Dothraki Sea, and I'm not sure Emilia Clarke will be able to pull it off (I'm fond of her performance as Dany - most of the time - but she's just such a different character at the end of ADwD that I'm not sure Emilia will be able to sell it without just playing it the same as she did in season 3).
Â 
And if "All men must die, but we are not men" is anything to go by............. the writers have no hope.

Tywin almost CAN'T recuse himself...no one could act impartially as a judge (or be seen to be, at least) if Tywin was not a judge as well.Â  OnlyTywin (if even then) can judge when the accused and victim are both Lannisters.Â  Anyone else would be seen as unable to cross Tywin.

Is it still considered a Khalasar though? At least in the show that is.
I mean I have no problem if she calls herself like that if so, but didn't they make it clear that women are not really worth anything as soon as their Khal dies?
Â 
Also, does she say she's "the" or "a" Khaleesi of the Dothraki Sea?
Â 
Sometimes it's hard to remember what's in the show and what's in the books. The book version makes more sense because she herself puts it in the right context.

3286	Yojimbo	2014-05-13	I actually didn't mind the goat bones, but only on the condition they will show the childs bones later on. Can see it now;
Â 
Shepherd comes back with a sack
Dany says something along the lines "I have already payed you 3x the sum of your flock the first time"
Messandei translates
Shepherd says something back
Messansei looks shocked, shepherd reveals his son's burned remains, Messansei says "He asks. What will the price of his son be, your Grace?"
Shocked Dany and crew
Cut to chaining dragons
Â 
But then again I don't really know what the show will do, I don't even think they are killing Shae off. And after all they did show Drogon kill a "kid"

3287	Pod The Impaler	2014-05-13	Varys could be lying. He could have another spy (interesting if true as then he may have one in the books too). Or it could genuinely be a glass candle!


Â 
Â 
I hope it is a glass candle, actually. The implications of that would be amazing.
3288	Queen of Whores	2014-05-13	Regarding the fight at the Dreadfort, I can't help but find it hilarious to imagine what would have happened if Victarion was there instead of Yara. He probably would have screamed "come at me bro!" then charged right towards Ramsay and his men by himself, all the while screaming a battle cry at the top of his lungs, swinging his axe left and right.
Book Asha > Show Yara

I don't have a single nitpick to your post on WiC.net! You pretty much summarized all the main complaints from recent episodes. Since I avoid that site (too much show-apologia for my taste), please inform if Cogman answers any of your questions. (And good luck with the reaction of show-apologists from there.)
3292	The hairy bear	2014-05-13	Shae accusing Sansa of conspiring with Tyrion to murder Joffrey makes absolutely no sense. Supposedly !showShae loved Sansa, and she must know that means her death if she's caught.Â 
I seem to be alone in that, but certainly believed that they could have done much better with teh Varys/Oberyn conversation.
Mace Tyrell can be a comic relief, but not this way.
The fearsome ironborn fleeing. Precisely after AshaYara motivational speech before the assault remarked that this was more about vengeance than about saving Theon. It's completely stupid.
Â 


However, the scene struck me as a continuity error.Â  We saw Roose return in episode 1 or 2.Â  If his castle was attacked, we should have seen him.Â  Furthermore, he simultaneously ordered Ramsay to take Moat Caitlin.Â  Ser Locke got to the Wall and Craster's Keep while Ramsay is still sitting around in the Dreadfort?Â  I'm almost positive this scene was originally meant to come before Roose's return, but something happened in the process and we now have a continuity error.


Â 
I think you hit right on the mark.
Â 
We see Ramsay hunting the girl in 4.2., accompanied with Theon. In the same episode, when Roose discusses the situation with Ramsay, Theon is also there instead of being closed in the kennels.

Looks like Petyr Patter and yourself did figure it out. If you're right, and your arguments are very convincing, it means D&D are not very faithful even to their own scripts, let alone to the source material.

3296	Skore	2014-05-13	The Ironborn scene.
Â 
BLERGH!
Â 
I enjoyed every scene in this episode except this one.
Â 
I know WHY they did it. It was to show that Theon has been truly broken to the point where he would even betray his family as he's so far gone into the Reek persona so that when he finally does re-adopt his own name it;s a much more potent scene for TV. Even the bath scene with Ramsay afterwards hammers this home as he asks Reek to "pretend" to be Theon.
Â 
But it did make the Ironborn look weak, which they just aren't, and should never be shown as such. The Ironborn are feared on every coast in Westeros and for good reason, THAT's the type of reputation they should be building for them. Instead we see a gray folk with the uncharismatic Balon, the wooden Yara and the thugs that made up her and Theons strike forces respectively. They need to get the finger out with the Ironborn as Victarion/Euron/Asha DO have big parts to play from what's implied in ADWD.

Â 
LOL I know, it was so terrible. Dany's response in the books - "All men must die ... but not for a long while, we may pray" - was so much more appropriate, insightful, and accurately reflected her feelings. "But we are not men" indicates that Dany feels confident about a victory against the Good Masters, but that contradicts the following scene where she is clearly shown to be anxious about switching Drogon for the Unsullied.
3298	Stannis Eats No Peaches	2014-05-13	The complaints about the goat are somewhat baffling to me. It's pretty obvious that the dragons will kill a child this season. This is just building up to it, which is exactly what happens in the book.
If they don't kill a child, I'll happily admit that I was wrong, but don't complain yet.
3299	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-05-13	Â 
3) Speaking of that fight, when the Iron Islanders are fighting Ramsey's men, why don't a few of them gang up on SHIRTLESS, VULNERABLE Ramsey and do him in nice and quick? They have shields! They have armour! Ramsey has pasty flesh! It's a no-brainer! The entire fight scene was teeth-grindingly infuriating and completely unbelievable. Are they setting up Ramsey as some invincible, insane supervillain? Are we entering the comic book realm? Are we supposed to be rooting for him? He's charismatic as all hellÂ but he also tortures and flays people for the lolz.
Â 


Â 
For the same reason that Polliver moronically turned his back on Arya, and Karl moronically turned his back on Jon Snow.
Â 
Answer: D&D suck ass.
3300	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-05-13	Â 
Ya, good breakdown.Â  Also, while he's taking the time to unlock the doggie pen, isn't that a great moment to rush him and bury an axe in his defenseless and armorless body? I believe what he's doing here is called lowering his guard?
Â 
"Oh, excuse me, time out.Â  I'm just going to unlock this door.Â  Half a mo' please while I release these dogs on you."


Â 
It felt very Simpsons-esque to me. Â I half expected Ramsay to struggle unlocking the gate only to have Yara and her comrades provide assistance. Â "No, you have push the key the whole way back before you start to turn it...".
Â 
Followed, of course, by the Monty Python-esque fleeing. Â "We can't risk another frontal assault. Â That dog's dynamite!"

Â 
From a purely technical standpoint and anyone familiar with visual media and film production it's just too obvious. It was just shoddy job, even at first glance. The missing running time, the incoherent editing, missing scenes from promotional material and all this only in one segment of the episode while the other scenes were all technically fine.
Â 
There is no other explanation really.Â
3307	Florina Laufeyson	2014-05-13	Do you guys have a theory as to why though? Too graphic? Or just unnecessary scene? Or something?

Â 
Probably because there was already too much violence against women that doesn't further the plot. That's assuming that Ramsay killed Myranda after the sex scene. It could easily be seen as sexploitation (mainly because of the combination of gore and sex). Maybe they also had continuity problems so they had to edit the scenes together as best as they could (maybe simply production errors). Pacing wasn't really a problem since they had almost 10min to spare. There were also very few actual segments in this episode so they probably couldn't just slap on a tiny scene from another character onto the whole thing without compromising another episode or the flow of this episode.

I got one real big nitpick with this episode. That fucking goat. RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGE!!! If the show doesnt eventually have that guy come back with the bones of his kid, im going to riot. Seriously. Im really mad about that. Snapping mad. Its incredibly important that the dragons nom on a human. Its the whole reason Dany locks up her dragons come on!  Fix it, show! FIX. IT.Â 
Â 


Â 
You keep raging about this. Â Drogon kills goats in the books. Â This scene happened implicitly in the books. Â This scene, in my opinion, serves to enhance the obvious distress that the scene with Hazzea will cause Dany. Â I would be a little bummed if they didn't show the Hazzea scene, but the new material with Hizdhar has already helped highlight the fact that the world is not as black and white as Dany thinks it is.
In my opinion, great episode. Â I understand the purpose of the Asha scene (remind people that the ironborn control much of the north, remind everyone that Asha/Yara exists, close up the plot of Asha going to war, and highlight how broken Theon is). Â I think A and B could be established through exposition and I think D has already been well established with the shaving scene. Â I guess they had to close up C though. Â I just wasn't a big fan in general. Â Still, great episode.

Â 
You got to remember though Davos was a smuggler, Stannis by all rights could have just hung Davos. He didn't, instead he rose Davos, a low-born up to knight-hood, now this is where I think the show hasn't capitalised enough on, yes Davos is glad and thanks Stannis that he doesn't have to live the rest of his life as a smuggler, but Davos love for Stannis comes from the fact that his children will live better lives than he will, take Devan for example; he is squire to the 'king', who has never gone hungry, can read and write and has all the luxury's of a noble born. Where as Davos at his age was a street urchin from Flea-Bottom and price Davos had to pay for this (at the time) was just four top halfs of his fingers, a price Davos was glad to pay.
Â 
Now here what I hate about the bank scene and just Stannis in general on this show; in the books it is Stannis who makes the decisions and speaks for himself. The only things Davos and Mel do for Stannis is try to temper his decisions in certain directions, Stannis will hear out there arguements but it is Stannis who leads, they are just his followers. Where as in the show Stannis is nothing more than a sock puppet with a crown, with either Mel with her hand up his arse or Davos. What more, the bank scene to me takes away from the fact Stannis is now going to the Wall, it at this point in the books I really start to like Stannis, because he sees the logic in Davos advice in going to the Wall and has a great line on it;
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>If not for my Hand, I might not have come at all. Lord Seaworth is a man of humble birth, but he reminded me of my duty, when all I could think of was my rights. I had the cart before the horse, Davos said. I was trying to win the throne to save the kingdom, when I should have been trying to save the kingdom to win the throne.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
Stannis does his first truely kingly thing, he takes what remains of his men and ships and heads of to the Wall, when the rest of the kingdom (who are in better fighting shape than Stannis) is just fighting over power. Where as the show Stannis heads off to Bravos to begs, is turned away and insulted until Davos speaks for him (even though I still don't get why the bankers would still give Stannis any money, when at this point Stannis is clearly the lossing horse, the realm is still being controled by Tywin and they are still making payments to the Iron Bank) so if the banker had not given Stannis the money, what would he have done? Head back to Dragonstone to mope?
Â 
I had a feeling last season I wouldn't like what I saw when Mance said "take 20 wildlings over the wall", I just didn't expect the writers to mess the events at the wall to mess things up so much.......owell still have the books

Hahahahahaha!
3321	Tormund GiantsMANE	2014-05-14	Folks nitpicking the goat scene (And I know I'm super late so my comment may fall on deaf ears),it was clearly a tease for a bigger "reveal" down the road. D&D like messing with book readers, so whenÂ  you see the goat, the shepheard, the boy and drogon it's almost automatic. You know what's coming, so much that you disregard certain small details. In this ep the goat hearder is the first "supplicant"Â  (somehow even befor the noble Hizadr)....Dany is told there are roughly 200 hundred more. In the book the goat header who lost his child was the last of the supplicants and waited until it was only him and Dany and her council, before he laid out the bones of his child. They're (hbo/writers) are just building it up for us. We'll prolly see a coupla more shepheards making claims (especially seeing how open handed the queen was about reparations) during future scenes with Hizzy trying to get the pits open. They may even have Dany do a similar "about face" as she did when Hizaroo asked for his dad's body. I imagine a scene similar to the book where she's mildly put off by or suspicious of all the claims she's been getting and then gets presented with the remains of a child. It will show another tough decisions Dany has to make during her "pre-queens". It's simple to pay 3x the market value for goats (especially from the coffers of a conquered city), but her choices after that "reveal" end up having much more gravity.
3322	Gus Petch	2014-05-14	In the books, it was ambiguous whether that Goat Herder (Hazzea's father) was telling the truth. Â It was left up to the readers to wonder whether Drogon actually did it or not. Â Perhaps the show will provide a definite answer. Â
3323	Tormund GiantsMANE	2014-05-14	Â 
It felt very Simpsons-esque to me. Â I half expected Ramsay to struggle unlocking the gate only to have Yara and her comrades provide assistance. Â "No, you have push the key the whole way back before you start to turn it...".
Â 
Followed, of course, by the Monty Python-esque fleeing. Â "We can't risk another frontal assault. Â That dog's dynamite!"


The plan isn't to murder Ramsay Snow and sneak away in the dead of night. The plan is to rescue Theon. For something that never happened in the story people sure have a firm grasp on why it happened and what it was setting up. This scene show's Theon's full Reek transformation. In the books he doesn't want to change his clothes and knows he's to be Ramsay's pet, but we never read or even consider that he would fight (ok Bite) his own sister to stay in the kennels because that's just how twisted and warped his mind is now. Him giving Reek a bath in their next scene is the icing on the cake. I also think that now Yara/Asha will be able to focus on the family she has (or doesn't have) back home. The show exposed "theon's favorite toy" well before the books sent everyone a "piece of prince" they had to flip her arc a bit.
Â 
and BTW I think most men armored or not would turn tail on a maniacal pack of mastiffs. It wasn'tÂ  like Ramsay was about to loose a litter of new born toy poodles on them. They couldn't risk capture.
3324	7th-key	2014-05-14	I think too, they cut a scene of Ramsay butchering his playmate. I'm glad they took it out. I has been discussed enough, nevertheless the gratuitous sexual violence is getting on my stomach. Yes, there's Theon, Varys and Unsullied, but those are plot relevant and defining for major characters (for the victim). Also (except for Theon) we are only told of those in the aftermath and never see it 'live'. There is a difference.
Â 
I agree, the Dreadfort scene would have made more sense before the return of Roose. Also for Ramsay: getting rid of both playmates in the same ep, clear indication that he's playing with people, even when they're also sadists.
Â 
I hope before he dies in a terrible way (death by wight?), someone will give him Littlefinger, in the same way LF gave people to 'particular clients'.Â
3325	Queen of Whores	2014-05-14	A minor nitpick I have is that neither Tommen or Jaime were present during the meeting of the Small Council. It seems odd that the new king (who has already been told by Tywin to listen to his advisors) wouldn't be there, as well as Jaime, since they established in 3x5 that the LC of the Kingsguard does sit in on the Small Council. They wouldn't even have to say much, just be there to fill out the room.
3326	Miodrag	2014-05-14	I forgot this last week, but what the hell: that TV Cersei is fully aware of Joff's evil side makes absolutely no sense. If she is aware, then how the hell she doesn't even think of the possibility Joff was killed because of his evilness, and not because someone (Tyrion) wanted to harm her?! Especially with her love for children TV show wants to emphasize every now and then. Wouldn't her instinct and her love for the other two kids make her instinctively at least question Tyrion's guilt?! In the books everything makes sense because she's obsessed with herself, as usual, and she's not to be bothered with possible faults her children (Joff) may have. In the show, however, she jumps between self-aware insightful individual and delusional egomaniac, and vice versa, with no explanation and in an instant, just as the writers need it.
3327	daggerseiuri	2014-05-14	Â 
What? I thought it was really well done, though Charles Dance is amazing. I think the writers are doing exactly what I thought as far as making Tyrion do a complete 180 into the dark, and I think Shae was the straw that broke the camel's back. That's why it felt shocking or overacted. That's not Peter's fault, it's a writing decision.Â 

Killing Shae really wasnt a 180 in the book. Tyrion is gray. Someone put it best on these very forums that once you take him away from the absolutely evil and mad characters that surround him in KL, you see how cruel, snobbish, and bitter he really is. And honestly saving KL, marrying Sansa, fighting at the Blackwater, it's all just an attempt to make up for his being a dwarf. He tries and tries to get people on his side so the maybe they won't despise him anymore but nothing can change it. Altruism with ulterior motives isn't actually altruistic, and after the plan to curry the favor of KL, the mountain clans, Dorne, etc fails he is left as he has always been- a bitter man unopposed to horrible acts. Not that he's all bad.
3328	daggerseiuri	2014-05-14	This is really a nitpick that crosses most episodes but I'm putting it here anyway:

3330	daggerseiuri	2014-05-14	Folks nitpicking the goat scene (And I know I'm super late so my comment may fall on deaf ears),it was clearly a tease for a bigger "reveal" down the road. D&D like messing with book readers, so whenÂ  you see the goat, the shepheard, the boy and drogon it's almost automatic. You know what's coming, so much that you disregard certain small details. In this ep the goat hearder is the first "supplicant"Â  (somehow even befor the noble Hizadr)....Dany is told there are roughly 200 hundred more. In the book the goat header who lost his child was the last of the supplicants and waited until it was only him and Dany and her council, before he laid out the bones of his child. They're (hbo/writers) are just building it up for us. We'll prolly see a coupla more shepheards making claims (especially seeing how open handed the queen was about reparations) during future scenes with Hizzy trying to get the pits open. They may even have Dany do a similar "about face" as she did when Hizaroo asked for his dad's body. I imagine a scene similar to the book where she's mildly put off by or suspicious of all the claims she's been getting and then gets presented with the remains of a child. It will show another tough decisions Dany has to make during her "pre-queens". It's simple to pay 3x the market value for goats (especially from the coffers of a conquered city), but her choices after that "reveal" end up having much more gravity.

I will forever love you for introducing me to the term "pre-queens".
3331	Fat Trell	2014-05-14	I forgot this last week, but what the hell: that TV Cersei is fully aware of Joff's evil side makes absolutely no sense. If she is aware, then how the hell she doesn't even think of the possibility Joff was killed because of his evilness, and not because someone (Tyrion) wanted to harm her?! Especially with her love for children TV show wants to emphasize every now and then. Wouldn't her instinct and her love for the other two kids make her instinctively at least question Tyrion's guilt?! In the books everything makes sense because she's obsessed with herself, as usual, and she's not to be bothered with possible faults her children (Joff) may have. In the show, however, she jumps between self-aware insightful individual and delusional egomaniac, and vice versa, with no explanation and in an instant, just as the writers need it.


Â 
I agree.
Â 
It speaks to a larger issue in my opinion; the show changes characterizationÂ and small events to such a point that when they revert to the book storyline it seems illogical.
3332	johnnysd	2014-05-15	Asha at Dreadfort is the best example for a total failure in writing a storyline. The Ironborn, known as the strongest warriors of Westeros, not fearing any battle even if they are outnumbered...getting jimjams because an unarmoured bastard nutjob releases some dogs.
Â 
I hope there will be something in Moat Cailin that might rescue the whole plot.Â 


Â 
Wow. Are people still thinking they fled the dogs? They left because Theon was no longer worth any iron price to get back. The scene was clunky and poorly edited, but it was there to show how far Theon truly is, and to set up the Kingsmoot for next season. Interestingly. most unsullied seemed to get the scene, book readers tend not to.
Â 
My nitpick, is that Davos words should have been Stannis. Would have been a much better scene.Â
3333	Le Cygne	2014-05-15	Then why show the dogs just before that?Â  The dogs were the reason the price would be paid.Â  The dogs!
3334	solidviper	2014-05-15	Killing Shae really wasnt a 180 in the book. Tyrion is gray. Someone put it best on these very forums that once you take him away from the absolutely evil and mad characters that surround him in KL, you see how cruel, snobbish, and bitter he really is. And honestly saving KL, marrying Sansa, fighting at the Blackwater, it's all just an attempt to make up for his being a dwarf. He tries and tries to get people on his side so the maybe they won't despise him anymore but nothing can change it. Altruism with ulterior motives isn't actually altruistic, and after the plan to curry the favor of KL, the mountain clans, Dorne, etc fails he is left as he has always been- a bitter man unopposed to horrible acts. Not that he's all bad.


Â 
That's true, I was speaking only about the show in my post, but I think we're going to see more of Book!Tyrion starting with what we just saw in the trial.
Â 
In a way this Tyrion is better to me because I think it'd be cool to see someone who has held his anger/bitterness in and used wit/intelligence as armor come completely undone. I think it makes for a really good character arc.
Â 
I like that better than "bitter guy with questionable motives gets angry and does horrible acts, and continues to be bitter with questionable motives."

I agree but the scene was still quite illogical.Â  To me, that whole scene was just an elaborate, illogical way to show the audience that Theon is becoming Reek in truth.Â  In actuality, the Iron Men had enough numbers to simply kill the Boltons, the dogs, and "rescue" Theon whether he wanted to go or not.Â  Then they could go about getting Theon back to his old self (or as close as he'll ever get again) after they got him free of Ramsey's clutches.
3336	Veltigar	2014-05-15	The results are in. But it was in a podcast, which I refuse to listen to. So, no idea what the results were.

Â 
"Give me my brother, and no more of you men will die." That's the last thing Yara says before Ramsay starts releasing the hounds. Next thing we see, she's running away into the boat. Could you then, please, explain in what exact moment did Yara realize Theon isn't worth it - before the hounds are to be released, or after? I mean, if unsullied got it, it's probably very obvious, so I guess you'll explain it easily.

3339	eumaies	2014-05-15	This is really a nitpick that crosses most episodes but I'm putting it here anyway:
Â 
Peter Dinklage needs a damn haircut (I realize Tyrion's been in prison.) It kept distracting me in his courtroom scenes that he kept tilting his head down and peeking through curls straggling down his forehead.
Â 
Some highlights wouldn't hurt, either. Aren't Lannisters supposed to be blonde? At least they put wigs of the right color on Lena Headey and Emilia Clarke, though their darkass eyebrows annoy me in every scene they're in.


Â 
Who say Tyrion is a Lannister?Â  Not that his hair should be brown, regardless...
3340	Stormland's Fury	2014-05-15	The Lannisters in the show have different shades of blonde but at least keep one wig (for Tyrion and Cersei) and stick with it. Their haircolor changes by the season. Charles Dance is of course greying and NCW can't really help it that his hair gets darker the shorter it is, but at least get the wigs right for those who aren't naturally blonde.

Also... People saying the Iron Born would have just thrown an axe at Ramsey. Yeah, in the book they would. But this isn't the book. Has it even been mentioned that they are awdsome at throwing axes? I don't think so. It's not canon in the show.

book purists and nitpickers would know that the goat herder who lost his child was the last of the "supplicants" who waited until after every other person had been heard so as not to cause a scene. After Dany hears him she's told there are 200 more people to be heard. The fact that this guy was the first petitioner, the first time Dany EVER heard petitions shoulda been the dead giveaway that it wasn't going downÂ  so soon. But haters gon hate.

for one to say they didn't like a scene is one thing, but to act as though the scene is a bastardization of book canon is another. I feel like folks are kinda loud and wrong on this one. They thought a certain scene was coming and it hasn't come yet. I'd equate it to folks who hit the buzzer early in Jeopardy and blurt out the question before they hear the "answer". They feel tricked but in reality they jumped the gun.

Exactly!Â  And I don't think it's logical or realistic at all to just leave Theon because he says he doesn't want to go.Â  I think it would be more logical to kill Ramsey, the dogs, etc. (and, yes, they certainly could have - Ramsey wasn't even armored!) and take Theon out of that very obviously horrible situation and then worry about getting him, hopefully, back to his senses.Â  In my opinion, that scene was just horrible in basically every wayÂ and showing the audience that Theon was truly "becoming" Reek could have been doneÂ much better.

But you have a problem with people nitpicking this scene's poor editing? The sequence of events does make it seem as if the Ironborn fled because Ramsay released his dogs. 
Yeah logic dictates that they weren't running solely because of the dogs, but it literally cuts from Ramsay asking how fast they can run and going to unlock the cage, to the Ironborn running back to their ships. Interpreting that as the IB running due the dogs isn't a dumb line of thought.

It's not totally dumb to think that the dogs are a contributing factor, but Theon not wanting to come, the castle alarms being sounded, and the fact that they could not be taken prisoner are other contributing factors that some nitpickers want to ignore. I'd agree with most that the scene was poorly executed, but I got the sense that their mission(rescue Theon) was a wash and they had to get outta there. Think of those bank robber movies. Those guys are tooled up, body armored up and all that, but they really don't wanna get into a shootout with police. They wanna get in, get the money and get out in 2 minutes or whatever. Hell sometimes the guys in the movies even leave money/valuables behind because of their timetable. It's not the same exactly, but this was an extraction, once you realize you have nothing to extract why dawdle and converse with the bloodlusty bastard of bolton.

As hand of the King,Grandsire to the King and father of the queen regent, I think Tywin would find himself in a stickier situation than he's accustomed to if he were to point the finger at anyone but the most obvious suspect at the time. Can you imagine the scene when Cersei calls for Tyrion (cup in hand) to be apprehended and out of the blue Tywin says "naaaaaah, grab that shriveled old lady....and someone find me Baelish". Also give the conspirators a little credit for laying out a really good plan. Some readers and viewersÂ  didn't know who was at fault until the reveal on screen. BTW conspirators have a commanding lead over the whistleblowers in Westeros.

Â 
Hahaha, this is pretty on. I really like Charles Dance's portrayal of Tywin, but him laughing at the dwarves jousting at the wedding feast and this automatic assumption that Tyrion is guilty are nagging at me. Did Book Tywin think Tyrion did it? I got the impression we didn't know/he didn't care.

I may have been reading wrong, but I always thought losing the first joint of every finger of Davos's right hand meant cutting off the last bone of each finger, the distal phalanges. (Yakuza style!) He makes that joke about Stannis giving him 5 fewer fingernails to clean.
Â 
Cutting off two bones seems much closer to just losing yer hand. You basically have a palm at that point. You can slap people with it, but you can't even grip or pick up anything. I can pick up my phone without using my fingertips; I can't without using the top two thirds of my fingers.

Â 
Â 
First off:
"Give me my brother and no more of your men will die."
Â 
That's the last thing we heard from Yara before fleeing. Â What changed other than Ramsay releasing the hounds?
Â 
Second off:
"They skinned our countrymen, and they mutilated my brother, your prince. Â Your prince! Â Everything they've done to him they've also done to you. Â As long as they can hurt our prince with impunity the word Ironborn means nothing."
Â 
Apparently it means nothing.
Â 
Third off:
The idea that Yara (1) instantly decided that Theon was permanently "lost" during the heat of a battle, (2) felt no need to put him out of his misery, and (3) felt no need to punish his tormenter is simply moronic. Â No one has any idea whether the damage to his psyche is irreparable, and the only way to find out would be to rescue him and return him to normalcy - something Yara was entirely intent on doing right up until Ramsey pulled out the key.
Â 
Not to mention, the sequence began with a sentry catching an axe to the head so....

I see where you are coming from but, really, why is Theon's permission needed in order for them to be able to "extract" him?Â  They could have simply taken him.Â  I mean, his reaction at the suggestion of leaving makes itÂ painfully obvious that he's completely terrified of Ramsey and they should justÂ get him the hell outta there and away from his influence.Â  And, they did have the numbers to do it.Â  Elsewise they wouldn't have been able to escape in any case but they did.Â  Also, shirtless Ramsey ass-kicking whirling dervish was laughable.Â

he didn't just push out his bottom lip,stomp his foot and say "I'm not going!" He was literally fighting her off. If someone mailed me my brother's dick in a box the last thing I'd expect is for him to fight me. Yara's a good leader and a strong warrior, but I dunno if she's the most pragmatic thinker.I acknowledged the poor execution, but I saw what they were trying to convey, even if it ended up being a bungled excuse to get her away from Pyke for a few episodes to set up a rude awakening.

3375	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-05-16	Â 
Â First off:
"Give me my brother and no more of your men will die."
Â 
That's the last thing we heard from Yara before fleeing. Â What changed other than Ramsay releasing the hounds?
Â Second off:
"They skinned our countrymen, and they mutilated my brother, your prince. Â Your prince! Â Everything they've done to him they've also done to you. Â As long as they can hurt our prince with impunity the word Ironborn means nothing."
Â 
Apparently it means nothing.
Â Third off:
The idea that Yara (1) instantly decided that Theon was permanently "lost" during the heat of a battle, (2) felt no need to put him out of his misery, and (3) felt no need to punish his tormenter is simply moronic. Â No one has any idea whether the damage to his psyche is irreparable, and the only way to find out would be to rescue him and return him to normalcy - something Yara was entirely intent on doing right up until Ramsey pulled out the key.
Â 
Not to mention, the sequence began with a sentry catching an axe to the head so....
Â 
I'm not sure why you think your non-deliberate misinterpretation of the scene is inherently superior to everyone else's, but it's not.

I don't think it's "better" lol
3376	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-05-16	I didn't think the scene was well done. I thought it was poorly done tbh. 
But they didn't run away because of the dogs. The heist was a write off by that point. Why waste more men on a lost cause? 
Scene could have shown that better though I agree.

Â 
Are you seriously defending this trash? Ramsay was SHIRTLESS, and Yara's first kill in the scene was with a throwing axe. But she didn't think to just... throw her axe at Ramsay?? It was embarrassing to watch.
3378	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-05-16	It wasn't the best I have said that. 
I just think people are saying "omg dogs lol" when, as badly made as it was, the scene clearly should more than that.
3379	Tormund GiantsMANE	2014-05-16	.....and it's dogs and soldiers/guards. They "fought" to a push basically man on man, how long would they have held out against them with a pack of trained to kill mastiffs sic'd on them? Reinforcements were on the way too. Ramsay is obviously The Most Dangerous Man in Westeros (sorry Darkstar)....the jig was up. She took her fastest ship and 50 of her best, all willing to pay the iron price for Theon's freedom. Theon on the other hand showed his sister he was willing to pay the iron price to remain Reek. However shortsighted her assessment of his mental damage was, you can't help anyone if you become a victim yourself, and dreadfort men were about to be pouring into the kennels.
3380	Le Cygne	2014-05-16	It takes two seconds to slit Theon's throat.Â  He's the reason she came.Â  If she left because he wasn't Theon anymore, putting him out of his misery would have been of the utmost importance.Â  If she didn't leave because of the dogs, don't show the damn dogs.Â  Or, if she left because of the dogs and not because Theon is not Theon, then don't say he's not Theon.
3381	Tormund GiantsMANE	2014-05-16	do those things have to be mutually exclusive? The presence of guards, and hunting dogs (no cocker spaniels here) in addition to the inability to secure the package could be the two factors that convince her that things have turned completely pear shaped. She asks for Theon before the whole dogs comment from Ramsay, so she's not in proximity to become a kinslayer and slit her brother's throat. I wonder how well that would have went over with the men who sailed and fought next to men who died for the purpose of saving Theon. Would they understand? Would they hold it against her? Would she go down as a kinslayer? Putting him out of his misery isn't of the utmost importance. She went to save him because he was a prisoner. When she presented him with freedom, he fought her to stay. I wonder if Ramsay woulda let them outrace the dogs if she killed his Reek.
3382	Le Cygne	2014-05-16	What they showed was obviously confusing to viewers. So you take away the unnecessary element that is adding to the confusion, and it becomes more clear. Pick a message you want to leave the viewer with, and go with it.
3383	Charlie Of House Bucket	2014-05-16	I just think people are saying "omg dogs lol" when, as badly made as it was, the scene clearly showed [sic] more than that.


Â 
Hmm.. a weird thing to say.Â  Judging by the supported and detailed logic behind iknownothingjonsnow's post, among others - to which your rather undetailed reply was to say "I don't think it's better lol" - I'd say it's more than just "omg dogs lol," no?
Â 
Give people some credit for thinking about these things, please. And yes, the scene did show more, when they were floating away on the boat and in a single resigned and disgusted sentence, but it's the contradiction of all the things in the aforementioned post and that moment that is worth nitpicking, hence the nitpicking in this thread, which incidentally is about nitpicking.
Â 
And there is a subtle difference between criticism and whinging (whining, for the Yanks).Â  It's an e-clichA© to conflate the two.Â  Mostly I see people calling scenes or details into doubt and giving reasons for their conclusions. I suppose I could attach a crying child's voice to it all and then it would be whinging, but I don't.
Â 
In any case, saying "people are whinging" is just carpet bombing everybody but nobody anyway, it's a catch-all insult, and it is just about completely useless.Â  You made the same carpet bomb "people are whinging" post in last week's nitpick thread.Â  We'll probably see it next week too, but maybe if you just stop clicking on the 'nitpick with impunity' threads, you can spare yourself the agony of so much rampant whingery, everywhere, from everyone but no one in particular, all the time.
3384	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-05-16	There is a lot of comments on the subject that suggest that the Iron Born ran because Ramsey "released the hounds" wouldn't you agree?
The scene isn't great, and it's weird when Ramsey runs in to the kennel covered in scratches for some unknown reason, but there is clearly more reason for Yara fleeing than Ramsey setting his dogs on them. Reek fights to stay, he is no longer Theon Greyjoy. It is a lost cause and Yara decides to flee rather than have more of her men killed. 
You are right though, what did I expect in the nitpicking thread?! I've seen plenty of fair criticism of the show, I don't think it's fair to criticise this scene for anything other than being weird and out of place, poorly edited and pretty anti climactic considering the end of season 3 scene at Pyke.

Considering that's exactly what the scene is being nitpicked for, yes I would wonder what you expected.

Â 
Ya, I'd say it was shoddily handled and leave it at that, but that's just me.Â  One would think she would be incensed enough to tear Ramsay apart for what he did.Â  She was pissed royal that Theon's sex toy was cut off, and there's no reason I can think of that having his mind ripped away too shouldn't make her absolutely googolplex furious enough to go full Bruce Lee at that point.
Â 
Although I'm inclined to agree with you that she just said to herself, "Oh to hell with it.Â  Theon's roached and this freak bloodlust maniac is threatening us with dogs; let's just go," for all we know she could have been rationalizing with the "my brother is dead" bit, and it was indeed just the dogs that made her hightail it out of there.Â  As has been pointed out though, her earlier speech is rendered just a bunch of meaningless bollocks in light of that particular interpretation. Poor handling of a deus ex machina idea by the writers, IMO.Â  I don't really feel comfortable with saying "clearly" on any of this though - hence the nitpicks.
3387	Bran's Legs	2014-05-17	"My brother is dead." Maybe Yara killed Theon off screen. Who knows? That's how bad that scene was.
3388	mankytoes	2014-05-17	Very nitpicky, but does it annoy anyone else that they (Tywin and the small council) are referring to Dany as a child, when she clearly isn't? If anything, Westerosi grow up quicker, so their age limit for a child would be lower, not higher. If that's a child, we're all peados... It feels like they've just ripped dialogue from the books without adjusting for the fact that they've aged the characters up.

Yep, the same thing happened in 2x1 when Jaime mocked Robb by calling him 'boy.'
3390	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-05-17	I think it's unbelievable how fast news travels in the show.

Â 
In the show isn't Daenerys supposed to be about 16/17? From an old man like Tywin that might seem more youthful than it actually is, same with 40 year old Jaime calling 18 year old Robb 'boy'.

Every time someone says child, it doesn't mean literally child, it means someone younger, it can be a put down, it can be a term of endearment, depends on how it's used. Also, "pedo" applies to pre-puberty, clearly Dany does not fit that description (girls typically enter puberty 10-11). And Westeros, she's a woman when she flowers, which dated to before the books began.

3393	Tormund GiantsMANE	2014-05-17	would this be the first time the viewers were confused? Are folks really confused? Because the nitpickers seem pretty well grounded in their understanding of the scene and general disagreement with what I guess folks would say is a conflict between words and actions (Yara's) or actions and reactions (going all the way to rescue him and then leaving abruptly). Those things could be cleared up though, as we have no idea what will happen when Yara gets to where she's going....she could give another long speech about why she left and clear up all confusion.
3394	Le Cygne	2014-05-17	It's a nitpick thread!Â  They may clear it up, they may not, but to date, it's confusing, that's all.Â  I don't know why she came, why she left, no one can know, that's the point.
					
					
							Edited by Le Cygne, 17 May 2014 - 11:09 PM.
3395	Stormland's Fury	2014-05-17	Maybe Yara just wanted to top up her travel mileage and deduct it as a business expense.
3396	Le Cygne	2014-05-17	Yarasha looked badass, that was the reason for the scene.Â  As such, I liked it.Â  It's one of those turn down the sound and enjoy the pictures scenes.
3397	Tormund GiantsMANE	2014-05-17	if you're a book reader,you've seen Yara/Asha flee before right? Maybe not onscreen, but I recall a pov where she and her ironborn hightail it out of some lord's castle they've overtaken,when they're attacked. She's loyal to her men and they're loyal to her. What was it she said, something to the effect that her men would wait on deck for a year for her if she commanded it? That type of loyalty is born from sound leadership. Her men know that if she asks them to lay down their lives it is not on a whim or for something foolish. When they paddle off and she's asked about Theon, she says "My brother is dead similar to Balon's response when Yara urged him to do something about Ramsay's letter at the end of S3. I get that it's a nitpick thread and the purpose is for us to post "grievances"; I just didn't come away as upset with the scene as most. Given that it's completely non-book canon material, I was interested in how the scene would play out.
Â 
Question : when Yara says "Give me my brother....." (right before the "release the hounds") if Theon grabs Ramsay and cries..."please don't let them take me m'lord", would that validate a hasty exit with dogs at their heels?He's clearly not trying to go and at the moment before the dogs are loosed Theon is actually with Ramsay and his dreadfort men. I also think folks are undervaluing a pack of rabid hounds in a close quarters fight ....an even strength fight (even armored) would turn drastically if one side had a pack of hounds attacking with them.

3398	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-05-17	I can't stress enough how bad the Yara scene was. Almost everything about it. Why show Ramsay boning during Yara's speech? Ruins any impact from the speech and makes me roll my eyes (thanks, HBO). What's with the weird transition from Ramsay boning to Ramsay covered in blood? Something was obviously cut out. What happened to Myranda? Why didn't they explain that Roose was gone from the castle? Why does Ramsay fight shirtless? Why wasn't he killed by an ironborn, or Yara at the end? Why would he let Yara get away? Why would she not mercy kill Theon? Why didn't they kill the dogs? What was the whole point of this? It defames the ironborn and Yara and makes them look even more stupid. The type of people to sail around the world and turn back to do it all over again at the first inconvenience. It's all very non-sensical and probably the worst scene of the season thus far.
Â 
If they really needed to give Yara something to do for the season, why not do the Kingsmoot?
That said, most of the other nitpicks in this thread are embarrassing.

3401	OnlyOne	2014-05-17	Whoever thought we needed Ramsay fanservice is clearly high. And him fighting and winning shirtless...Yeah, totally realistic.

Asha was just anti-climatic and filler.
Â 
I do hope we do get eventually the child burning storyline. I'm guessing they'll want that for bigger impact on the season finale or episode 8.

KL was good, but I don't get why the necklace seemed in perfect shape- last we saw it, Littlefinger smashed it to pieces.

Um, girls do not typically enter puberty at 10-11. It's unusual that young-not unheard of, simply unusual. If I were to nitpick something on the boards, it would certainly be the pseudoscience and psychobabble.

A simple search of terms and there are thousands of relevant results at one's fingertips.Here's the source cited (Duke University) and other sources concur:Â The average age of pubertal onset in girls is 10-and-a-half years old, but it ranges from seven to 13 years old... The whole process of puberty should take three to four years... The first sign of puberty in girls is most often breast development...http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty

3404	Woman of War	2014-05-18	Technically quoting Wiki kills the debate and you may have won, Le Cygne
And yet being erotically interested in ten or twelve year olds is certainly not a positive thing in Westeros or our world. This debate happened so often in these forums and we know that kids that age are forced into sex all the time in the books and in RL. And yet no one should justify this with the argument that they technically have reached puberty, it sounds dangerously close to downplaying abuse.
3405	Le Cygne	2014-05-18	Now, on to the fantasy world of Westeros, where the author discusses the context.Â  Here he discusses Dany having sex at 13 (obviously well into and close to beyond puberty, she has "flowered" so she is considered a woman in Westeros):Â One of the reasons I wanted to do this with HBO is that I wanted to keep the sex. We had some real problems because Dany is only 13 in the books, and thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s based on medieval history. They didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have this concept of adolescence or the teenage years. You were a child or you were an adult. And the onset of sexual maturity meant you were an adult. So I reflected that in the books. But then when you go to film it you run into people going crazy about child pornography and thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s actual laws about how you canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t depict a 13 year old having sex even if you have an 18 year old acting the part â<U+0080><U+0094> itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s illegal in the United Kingdom. So we ended up with a 22 year old portraying an 18 year old, instead of an 18 year old portraying a 13 year old. If we decided to lose the sex we could have kept the original ages. And once you change the age of one character you have to change the ages of all the characters, and change the date of the war [that dethroned the Mad King]. The fact we made all these changes indicates how important we thought sex was.Â http://shelf-life.ew...e-with-dragons/Â Long story short, them saying Dany is a "child" on the show (where she is actually, by the way, 20) is not a problem. It's a figure of speech (and they got it from the books).

3406	voodooqueen126	2014-05-18	Well. Puberty is happening earlier due to a variety of mysterious factors. It used to occur much later.
3407	Le Cygne	2014-05-18	The way he set the context, I think he must be tired of talking about it. That interview came out about the time of season 1, when there were lots of new readers. I always get the impression he's saying, work with me here. I messed up. I used to wonder why he didn't just go with an aging up in the novels, too. Give them all a couple of years and be done with it.
3408	voodooqueen126	2014-05-18	But in Daenerys's case, she would be a 16ish, which to someone like Tywin (aged 67 in the show) would make her a child. Book Daenerys had experienced menarche before her first chapter, I suppose this was considered early by medieval standards (but then Margaret Beaufort delivered the future Henry VII before her 13th birthday).
3409	Le Cygne	2014-05-18	Right, I was responding to someone upthread who was puzzled that Dany was called a child on the show (Cersei also calls her a child on the show). In the books, child is used as a relative term. Jaime (who is 15 years older than Brienne) refers to Brienne (who is nearly 20 in the books) as a child.On the show, GRRM is indicating Dany started at 18 (they had to make her older for the sex scenes), and about 2 years has passed (maybe more), so she's about 20 now.(Just for anyone curious, Brienne tells us she fell in love with Renly when she was 13 and he was 16, that places her at almost 20 in the books, I think...)

3410	Tormund GiantsMANE	2014-05-19	doesn't a kingÂ  have to die prior to the kingsmoot? was Yarasha home when said king expired?
3411	darksellsword	2014-05-12	What is the consensus on Who Tywin was writing to in Meereen? .
I have read speculation that it is to Daenerys informing her of Jorah's duplicity.
I fail to see what this would achieve in the long term, sure it would remove Jorah as Daenerys closest advisor but as Tywin and the council already know she has Ser Barristan a great commander and the greatest knight who ever lived.
It is hardly a good strategy to do something that may antagonise Daenerys. If this is the way they are going to reveal Jorah's betrayl I think it's pretty weak writing and inferior to the books reveal.It might be plausible that Tywin is infact writing a letter to a noble house in Meereen offering them some kind of arrangement were they create some kind of insurgency against Dany and he will reward them financially.
3412	MoA«t	2014-05-12	Considering show Barristan Selmy never sat on Robert's Small Council, who else is there to out Jorah?Â
3413	The 10th Penny King	2014-05-12	Definitely to Dany. Â It serves to drive the Jorah betrayal plot and causes strife in the Meereen camp. Â Troubles in Meeren means they aren't thinking about heading West.
3414	Fog Machine	2014-05-12	I'm sure Barristan if he didn't serve on the Small Council attended meetings of the Small Council particularly when Ned joined as the King's Hand, I recently rewatched the first three seasons and I was surprised how much Barristan features... prior to watching my only recall of the character was the scene where Joffrey 'retires' him from the King's Guard but he crops up rather more often in season one
3415	lostinasia	2014-05-12	I assume it'd be a bit more subtle than say "Hello Not-Queen Dany, Jorah is a spy." For example, perhaps a letter asking Jorah for his latest report could "accidentally" go astray and fall into Barristan's hands - with Barristan as something of a dupe to Tywin. Or the letter could somehow cast doubt on Barristan as well?
3416	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-12	Why in the seven hells would Dany believe Tywin Lannister?
3417	Lord Damian	2014-05-12	Tywin might send a false letter that he hopes gets intercepted to Jorah that outs him while not trying to look like they are.
3418	RoamingRonin	2014-05-12	Offering Tommen's hand in marriage? Jaime's?Â
3419	High-born Plumber	2014-05-12	OOooOoohhhh!
I hadnt thought it was likely to Dany...
Good stuff.
3420	Xyzzy	2014-05-12	My take was that he wrote to Jorah offering his lands and title back - with maybe an implied threat to the other living Mormonts? Jorah wanted to go home in the books.
Edit: In return for offing Dany

3421	Widows_Blood	2014-05-12	I think the purpose of the letter is to spread news throughout Meereen that Jorah has been spying on her. The news will eventually reach Dany. I don't think it is meant to be a direct letter to her. The goal is probably to create dissension among her ranks and remove her most valuable and trusted adviser. Which will segue nicely into Varys sending Tyrion to her.Â
3422	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-05-12	I've been telling you guys, Tywin is just a huge cockblock. First it was interrupting Oberyn's pants-on orgy, and now he's going to cockblock Jorah from half a world away. I bet poor Jorah is going to take a breath and finally get ready to make a move on Dany and then BAM! Tywinblocked!
3423	Seneti	2014-05-13	I assume it'd be a bit more subtle than say "Hello Not-Queen Dany, Jorah is a spy." For example, perhaps a letter asking Jorah for his latest report could "accidentally" go astray and fall into Barristan's hands - with Barristan as something of a dupe to Tywin. Or the letter could somehow cast doubt on Barristan as well?


Â 
Exactly this. Whoever that letter will go to, I'm 95 % sure that it will eventually cause Jorah's downfall. We know that Barristan sticks with Dany throughout ADWD, so whatever that letter may say about him will not have the desired effect.
3424	Envie	2014-05-13	Someone please remind me who sent Ser Jorah his 'royal pardon' again? Is this relevant to the now current situation and what Tywin might be sending that way?
3425	DormeDwayne	2014-05-13	I've never even though of Dany O_o I supposed he was going to pull some strings in Mereen, see if he can get someone to off her, not write directly to her. But it makes sense - someone has to out Jorah, and since Barristan seems not to be the one...

3428	The Lady Lannister	2014-05-13	My take was that he wrote to Jorah offering his lands and title back - with maybe an implied threat to the other living Mormonts? Jorah wanted to go home in the books.
Edit: In return for offing Dany


Â 
This. Although it does not have to be a threatening letter. I should really show the gratitude the realm owesÂ Jorah due to his sterling spy-work, blah, blah, blah and asking one last favour, killing Dany,Â in return for hisÂ full pardon, titles and lands. If Jorah obliges, great. If not, somebody will find that letter and there isÂ the chaos Tywin seeks.
3429	Chebyshov	2014-05-13	Someone please remind me who sent Ser Jorah his 'royal pardon' again? Is this relevant to the now current situation and what Tywin might be sending that way?


Â 
That kid in the market told Jorah that the pardon was from "the spider," but I'm sure Robert had to sign off on it.
Â 
My guess is that Tywin writes to Barristan, but doesn't sign it as himself.Â

This was my thinking also. Offering him a pardon and lands. There must be plenty of titles going after the slaughter of the last few years.
I see the letter saying something like "We wish to restart your previous spying activities..." And when Dany finds the letter she will know hat he had once been a spy.
3431	robdavies1775	2014-05-13	I don't think he'll write directly to Dany because Dany may just suspect it was a ruse.Â 
I think he'll either write to Jorah asking him why he isn't spying for the Lannisters anymore, with the intention that the letter falls into Dany's hands.Â 
Â 
OR
Â 
He writes to Barristan, apologising for the dismissal and asking him to return and say Jorah can come to seeing as he was spying on Dany, that way either Tywin gets both Knights back or Barristan is loyal to Dany, reports Jorah's actions and Dany loses an advisor.Â
3432	Gran de Lys	2014-05-13	I think Tywin will be far more circumspect than to mention the word "spying." More like an offer to restore his land and titles and rescind his exile state as a reward for his recent stalwart service on behalf of the Iron Throne. It won't go to Dany, but it will find its way to her, and she'll have a lot of awkward questions to ask, which makes for a better conversation than, "I just got a letter from the man I hate and mistrust most in the world stating the man I trust most is a spy! Explain yourself, Ser Friendzone. And, um, personal space, please. We discussed this."

I think this is the most plausible out come and what I like about it the most is its very Tywin. If he gives details of what Jorah reported back and of the attempted poisoning of Dany and her unborn child, there is no way it wouldn't cause Dany to at least confront Jorah about it. Tywin must be confident of being able to convince Ser Barristan to return to his role as commander of the Kings guard he swore and oath after all. The out come in Tywin's view would be Daenerys without Selmy and Mormont reducing the threat considerably.
3435	Seneti	2014-05-13	He writes to Barristan, apologising for the dismissal and asking him to return and say Jorah can come to seeing as he was spying on Dany, that way either Tywin gets both Knights back or Barristan is loyal to Dany, reports Jorah's actions and Dany loses an advisor.Â 


Â 
I think that one is most likely, although I think the letter might "accidentally" end up in Dany's hand, prompting her interrogation of Jorah and Barristan as in the books.
3436	Guard of the Rainking	2014-05-13	It would be super hilarious if it would just be a guy with a lute playing The Rains of Castamere to Daenerys.

Â 
Perhaps he pays people to burn her fleet of 93 ships?
Â 
Â 
It is a bit of a problem if Tywin tells Dany or sends a message informing about Jorah. It would make Danys decision to exile him appear many times more foolish than necessary as she would be letting Tywin sow dissent and shit stir. Its subtly telling the viewer that exiling Jorah is in her enemies direct interests.

I would kinda like it to go down this way... and it would make sense on the back of Tywin saying how stupid it was to remove Selmy from the KG.

This gave me a good laugh
3442	daggerseiuri	2014-05-14	What is the consensus on Who Tywin was writing to in Meereen? .
I have read speculation that it is to Daenerys informing her of Jorah's duplicity.
I fail to see what this would achieve in the long term, sure it would remove Jorah as Daenerys closest advisor but as Tywin and the council already know she has Ser Barristan a great commander and the greatest knight who ever lived.
It is hardly a good strategy to do something that may antagonise Daenerys. If this is the way they are going to reveal Jorah's betrayl I think it's pretty weak writing and inferior to the books reveal.It might be plausible that Tywin is infact writing a letter to a noble house in Meereen offering them some kind of arrangement were they create some kind of insurgency against Dany and he will reward them financially.

Excuse me. Excuse me. Prince Aemon the Dragonknight was the greatest knight who ever lived.
3443	Fevre River Warrior	2014-05-15	I think the letter is going to someone with the intent of assassinating Dany. He does not want her around. He knows Robert was intent on having she and her brother killed but Ned stopped him. We will have to see but I think he is writing to one of the sellsword companies to kill Dany.
Â 
Remember his letters led to the Red Wedding....he his probably contacting someone to kill Dany.

Â 
Â 
But Varys tells Tywin at the Council that Jorah no longer spies for them and appears totally devoted to her now. Its hard to see how Twin could come to the conclusion that he could offer anything more to Jorah as incentive.
Â 
IMO he would either have to
Â 
- Up the reward significantly rather than being reinstated as Lord of Bear Island
Â 
- Threaten to exterminate everyone on Bear Island by telling the Boltons to do it. (be interesting if this is later learned and one of the reasons why the Mormonts join Stannis)

Â 
If he does write to Jorah, having the letter intercepted would probably be the whole point. The goal isn't to have Jorah betray Dany - the goal is to cause trouble by having Jorah's earlier betrayal revealed.

Â 
But how does that achieve Tywins objective of neutralizing Danys army? Losing Jorah might lose her one advisor and spite her but it will hardly cripple her.
Â 
Even if the Second Sons betrayed her it wouldn't be a disaster on the scale of the Red Wedding.
Â 
He'd obviously only take an action with a chance of it succeeding at crippling or neutralizing Dany. So asking Jorah to kill Dany would have to have some chance of success in Tywins eyes.Â

Â 
But he has to be in a position to offer something that is his to give. Even Tywin doesn't have the power to strip, for example, the Glovers and clansmen of their lands. Theres not lot he could offer him that has not already been offered (Bear Island back).
Â 
I am just a bit worried that this is a change which will end up altering the tone of Jorahs exile to show Dany is a worse light. Plus it seems a little forced if he offers what Jorah already turned down and has little to no reason to believe that Jorah would betray Dany at this point. "Entirely devoted to her" does not sound like another Walder Frey...
Â 
If anything Daario and the Second Sons would be the most logical place to try to manipulate with money to betray Dany. Especially since this is what they do later on (not Daario but the company itself).

Â 
Well actually its Barristan who is dismissed and he is the most discussed character in this sequence. But I don't see how Tywin would think that he could manipulate Barristan like he did Walder Frey to kill Dany.
3454	DaveyJoe	2014-05-15	I think the show has handled Tywin and his machinations very well over the past 4 years. Â The hand wringing is unnecessary, just wait and see how it plays out.

Â 
Perhaps. But it feels like they are just doing this to replace Barristans reveal of Jorahs betrayal and there needs to be reason for Tywin to believe that his actions will achieve something otherwise it would look forced.

Â 
Well, then that would be a first in the show.
Â 
I think the whole point is that thanks to the letter Dany finds out he spied. It's not much different than in the books. She'll probably figure out the same things here as well, as with the assassination attempt when she was pregnant that Jorah interrupted. That was the thing that pushed her over the edge in the book.

Especially if fomenting unrest is Tywins goal.If in the show she is told to exile Jorah by Tywin, whereas in the books she is told to exile Jorah by Barristan; it kind of would reflect badly on her.

I don't think exiling Jorah is Tywin's goal. I think his goal is to make spying on her lucrative for him. If letter falls in Barristan hands we're at book trajectory to his banishment.
3460	yushkevitch	2014-05-15	I know it's a virtual impossibility but since Jorah is no longer helpful to Tywin, wouldn't it be an absolute huge curveball to readers if Tywin's letter is to Selmy, who in turn betrays Dany?
Â 
I know, blasphemy! Barristan is loved by most readers but admit that it would floor you if it happened ... okay, maybe a little less now that I've mentioned it but hey, it's not happening anyway  But I for one would love to see a few more huge surprises in the form of diverting from the books.
Â 
And at least in this case, it *could* make sense plot-wise. Jorah can still be discovered as a spy (outed by Barristan after receiving the letter - whereas he earns trust with Dany and makes his eventual betrayal even more shocking. All the while both viewers and readers are completely unaware of what's to come as Selmy would turn the letter over if he wasn't secretly helping Tywin) so Mormont's story with Tyrion can go on relatively undisturbed. And since nothing hugely important happens with Selmy until ... well, until the end of ADwD ...Â

Â 
Asking Jorah to stab Dany in the back is hardly a good plan though. Walder Frey had an army to help him betray Dany as well as the Boltons. Theres every chance Jorah would be killed instantly by the Unsullied even if Tywin believed he would accept it. Also, Varys conversation gives the exact opposite indication that Jorah could be bought. The show COULD have said that Jorah was still sending reports or was uncertain as to his loyalties but Varys is pretty unequivocal. So I am not sure how Tywin would arrive at the conclusion that he could buy Jorahs loyalty from the scene we saw last week. Varys is telling him that a Northern Knight who fought against the mad king to avenge the Starks has become super loyal to Daenerys and given up on a chance to return to Bear Island. That does not sound like a man who can be bought like Walder Frey anymore than Tywin could have asked Dacey Mormont to stab Rob Stark. Telling a loyal man you are planning an assasination attempt risks them learning of Tywins intent and taking precautionary measures. So, Tywin sending a letter asking Jorah to kill Dany wouldn't make sense on a number of levels.
Â 
I think he'll send the letter to the Second Sons and Daario will reject it. Perhaps this is what they discuss in next episode. It may be that this letter alludes to Jorah having been a spy but no longer.Â

Â 
Show Barristan is really undermined on the show and not portrayed anywhere near as positively as he is in the books.
Â 
- He tells Jorah to get lost in season 3. Which is unreasonable and inverts what happens in the books where Jorah is being unreasonable asking for Arstan to be kicked out.
Â 
- He says that the Champion of Meereen is no threat whereas Jorah notes the propaganda value. Again, inversion of what happens in the books.
Â 
- He says that they can take Westeros with 10,000 men and "the old houses will rise". Such nievity is perhaps more reflective of the character in the book but in this context he is slightly shown up by Jorah whose advice ends up being taken up by Dany to help her make her decision.Â
3463	missingm	2014-05-15	I thought that the letter was an excuse to get Tyrrell out of the room while they discuss something really sensitive. But it could be a letter to Jorah asking if the new spy Barristan has arrived.

Â

Â 
This cracked me up, especially the part about Cersei being optional - LOL.Â  
Â 
Maybe Tywin was just wanting to try his hand (har har) at poetry since Oberyn's already shown he's a lover and poet that gets the hot women and men with just his sexiness instead of gold. Maybe he's going to write Dany a Haiku.
3465	TheVatican	2014-05-15	Tywin thinks at a much larger level.Â  Spying could be what he wants, but he has that already through Varys, at least in his mind.
Possible Book Spoilers, not sure how much I can say.
Â 
Â 
For Tywin, taking Dany out is preferable, but I believe that he thinks it is a long shot, he may or may not continue down this path.Â  However, just because he seeks assasination or spying, does not mean other avenues are closed to him.
Â 
I believe what he will seek to do is begin to support or encourage a civil revolution and or unrest.Â  This serves many purposes:
Â 
1)Â  Causes Dany's rise in power to be lessened.Â  She has up until this point, increased in strength.Â  Tywins see's this and knows this.Â  Remember, Tywin knows that some wars are fought by the pen as well.Â  But he understand that some are faught by force, and he states this is the GoT series, while in the Little Counsel Meeting.
Â 
2)Â  This civil unrest/revolution will cause friction and perhaps a lessening of Dany's protection and hence put her in greater danger, hence giving an opportunity for an assasination attempt.
Â 
The manner in which I believe that Tywin will do this is, simple. The Sons of the Harpy.Â  I believe this is how such an organized retaliation against Dany is going to be formed in this GoT universe.

This just makes my day right now. Thank you.
3467	Tyrion1991	2014-05-16	I don't see how Tywin could foment unrest among the Ghiscari nobles. He would need to give them gold and men. He has neither to give. Plus the show has went to great lengths to show Dany as the "evil queen" so you don't need tywin to cause the dissension.Â 
Â 
One possibility is that he gets some men to set fire to the fleet she is not supposed to have. This would keep Danys army trapped in Meereen. However the fleet was never mentioned at the council meeting so Tywin acting on it appears unlikely.
3468	The Fourth Head	2014-05-16	I think the truth is probably damaging enough: A letter thanking Jorah for informing that Dany was carrying a child would be a slam-dunk. Perhaps throwing him that he has a full pardon, and inviting him to return to take up his lordship- perhaps detailing a ship arranged to pick him up and asking him to take the Second Sons with him- paying them with empty Lannister promises. If that letter got into the dutiiful and trusted Selmy's hands, the outcome is inevitable and you have a simple means of getting the show and books back in realignment.
Â 
Dany without Jorah is a weaker proposition. She would not have any unsullied had it been for Selmy, and she would have sailed to Westeros expecting the country to rally to her side had she listened to Selmy. I think Tywin recognises that a young girl and a noble fool is a much weaker and more predictable prospect without Jorah's street-smarts thrown into the mix.
Â 
I love the idea that Varys could be the one behind Jorah's downfall, having used him, then betrayed him, before replacing Jorah with Tyrion- thus betraying Tywin, only for the pair of them to meet Â in neither capacity. It's shaping up nicely and would be a good dodge around the absurd Arstan Whitebeard identity which was tediously transparent in the books, and would have been even more tediously transparent in the show. It would have been dragged out for at least 14 months. At least this way, it's Tywin's final damaging act, and echoes the RW in the sense that Tywin only has to put pen to paper to wield damaging power from afar. I can't wait for Ian Glens' performance!

If most of non-book readers are thinking that way, then everybody will be freaking out when Dany marries Hizdahr. 
Â 
I think it's somehow connected with Jorah spying reveal.
3470	RoamingRonin	2014-05-16	Is it possible that the letter never arrives considering what's happening in King's Landing?
3471	sati	2014-05-16	Is it possible that the letter never arrives considering what's happening in King's Landing?


What would be the point of that scene then? I think they included it to tie it to Jorah's banishment somehow.

Ser Barristan a great commander and the greatest knight who ever lived.



Excuse me. Excuse me. Prince Aemon the Dragonknight was the greatest knight who ever lived.


No love for my man Arthur Dayne? Sword of the Morning? Could cut a bunch of kingsguard down with his left hand while taking a piss with his right?
Â 
... go lefties. Born or de facto via maiming/the call of nature.
3473	Mad Monkey	2014-05-16	The greatest knight who ever lived was Baelor Breakspear.
3474	Strytos	2014-05-16	I understand that Jorah needs to be outed somehow for the overall plot, but the notion that Tywin would make a big effort to out him seems a little strange. Would Tywin even concern himself with someone like Jorah, he'd probably consider him irrelevant.Â
3475	spunken en eggs	2014-05-16	Â 
That kid in the market told Jorah that the pardon was from "the spider," but I'm sure Robert had to sign off on it.
Â 
My guess is that Tywin writes to Barristan, but doesn't sign it as himself.Â 


he cant white it himself en say its some one els, barri knows his handwriting. ( hand for 30 years, must have written something in that time)
Â 
he doest need to just say, " u two have been super-spys now kill her en come home for a party... much love tywin" this will mess deny up enough to send one of them away en she thinks see will be betrayed for love so sad-bear gets the boot. works for the show en is close to the books. in the books its better thow.
3476	Mad Monkey	2014-05-16	I understand that Jorah needs to be outed somehow for the overall plot, but the notion that Tywin would make a big effort to out him seems a little strange. Would Tywin even concern himself with someone like Jorah, he'd probably consider him irrelevant.There was some concern about the fact that Dany had two knights advising her, which Varys makes seem as dangerous to them as her unsullied army.
3477	Seneti	2014-05-16	Well, I guess if Tywin really wanted to lay it on thick, he'd be doing the following:
Â 
1) writing a letter to Jorah about resuming his services as a spy, which "accidentally" ends up in the hands of Barristan - cue general dissent among Dany's advisors and possibly her banishing of both of them (Jorah for spying on her, possibly Barristan for being so close to the king that he surely knew what was going on - even though we know he didn't)
Â 
2) writing a letter to Daario in the hopes that the Second Sons will abandon Dany for an offer of lots of gold
Â 
3) sending some of Varys' little birds to start a fire in her shiny new navy, thus getting her stuck in Mereen for good, possibly ordering the burning of the woods around Mereen, in case the Masters haven't done that yet
Â 
4) sending one of Varys' little birds to leave a message on the walls of Meereen that makes it look like the Masters were behind it all, thus driving that wedge between her and the nobles of Meereen even deeper.
3478	Colonel Green	2014-05-16	But how does that achieve Tywins objective of neutralizing Danys army? Losing Jorah might lose her one advisor and spite her but it will hardly cripple her.


It furthers his goal.Â  Just because getting rid of Jorah doesn't immediately cripple her, doesn't mean it isn't worth doing.Â  Getting rid of Jorah by getting him busted for spying is an easy card to play.Â  For the rest he can devise more complex stratagems going forward.
Â 
Writing to Barristan wouldn't make sense, because there'd be no reason for Dany or Barristan to believe anything Tywin told him.
3479	Raffles	2014-05-17	I understand that Jorah needs to be outed somehow for the overall plot, but the notion that Tywin would make a big effort to out him seems a little strange. Would Tywin even concern himself with someone like Jorah, he'd probably consider him irrelevant.Â 


Â 
But.. Tywin doesn't consider Dany irrelevant. So, by sowing seeds of discontent in her camp, he can make it easier for himself.
3480	Kevoncox	2014-05-18	I actually think it is neither,
I think it is the ball that starts the Sons of the Harpy.
Promising support from Westeros for the wealthy families of Merreen.

Â 
But he doesn't have any money or troops to give them. He can give them words of encouragement. Maybe say shes her fathers daughter etc etc Insert propaganda line. They already have enough reason to dislike Dany and having him throw wood out on the fire would look pretty weak. Also, making him the cause of the Harpy would undermine the shows efforts to try and treat the slavers position with some sympathy. If their resistance is purely the result of the machinations of Tywin then they are just an extension of his evil.
Â 
Plus, it would not look good if Dany does what Tywin wants her to do. If your nemesis is telling you "this guy was spying on you but he betrayed us so we have no problem telling you if you will get rid of him for us as him helping you puts us at a major disadvantage." you don't up and do it.Â

I understand what you are saying but I think his words were important. He asked, if Varys' birds can get into Meeren.
3483	Eddard the Builder	2014-05-12	So there's a bit of confusion here. Â In the books Tywin dismisses Cersei from the Council, however here it seems that Cersei is still Queen Regent. Or at least I thought until this episode.Â  Oberyn says she's the former Queen Regent (because Joff has come of age in the show version), was she reappointed Regent after Tommen I took the throne? Â And if so, why then did Tommen say that Tywin was Hand of the KingÂ andÂ Protector of the Realm?
3484	Envie	2014-05-14	Because Tommen is parroting exactly what he's been told to say, by Tywin. And Tywin isn't going to cede one ounce of power or title to Cersei. Period.
3485	Mad Monkey	2014-05-14	Because Tommen is parroting exactly what he's been told to say, by Tywin. And Tywin isn't going to cede one ounce of power or title to Cersei. Period.Agreed. If Tommen had kept reading, he probably would have gone on to say, "...and I King Tommen, the First of My Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, declare my mother Cersei Lannister to be a spoiled brat who needs to listen to her father and do as she's told."

3486	Cubarey	2014-05-14	Here's a question on something I just noticed when I resaw the last two episodes. When Tommen is addressed he is said to be Tommen Barathean, First of His Name, etc. Now is this not a change from Joffrey who9 styled himself Joffry Barathean-Lannister, First of his name? And if I have it right why the change?
3487	Petyr Patter	2014-05-14	I think the show sort of dropped the ball regarding the politics.Â 
Â 
Queen just means you married a king.Â  Her only real job is to have the king's children so he can have heirs.Â  She has no powers of state, though her proximity to the king and social status typically translates into a type of authority.Â 
Â 
However, when Robert died, Cersei called herself queen REGENT.Â  A Regent rules for the actual king because he is still underage.Â  He or she has real power and authority.
Â 
The show makes it sound like QUEEN has power, and regent is an afterthought.Â  Of course, Tywin Lannister had the money, soldiers, and reputation to wield actual power regardless of titles.Â  When he realized Cersei had no business being in charge of a company picnic, he planned to send her away and probably claim the regency for himself.Â  Cersei was in no position to stop him.Â 
Â 
Yet, on the show it makes it look like by marrying Joffrey, Margaery would become Queen Regent and that simply isn't true.Â  Margaery's pep talk to Sansa about "children learning from their mothers" is a better description of the power she would have.Â
3488	Cubarey	2014-05-14	"Cersei was in no position to stop him. "
Â 
Â 
Well she had no true power that is true. As her namiing herself regent this is only a bit off. In the real world in the real world in England the House of Lord's (or later the House of Commons) would have likely been the political body to proclaim a "Regent" (In the case of George III's incapacity due to madness it was the House of Commons who declared his son Regent). In Westeros it would of probably been the Small Council's duty to confirm a Regent. In the present case it's not really an issure as the members of the small council are in Tywin's pocket and Cersi calling herself "Regent" really is irrelevant as long as Tywin is around. If he were to leave the scene for any reason then the council's acquiesance in Cerci's declaring herself Regent becomes important.Â 
Â 
Â 
"Yet, on the show it makes it look like by marrying Joffrey, Margaery wouldÂ becomeÂ Queen Regent and that simply isn't true. "
Â 
Actually having been Joffrey's Queen might, but for the fact that the Lannister's totally control the small council, might have given Â Margary a decent argument why she would have deserved to be named Regent. However, the fact that the marriage was not consumated probably means that the marriage was legally void (which in itself is a pretty important fact since in Fuedal times if a woman was legally married to one brother she could not legally marry her brother in law if her husband died. So, that depending on how close Westros Law and the Religion of the 7 actually mirrored English fuedal law and Catholic doctrine of the time, the fact that Margarey never consummated her marriage to Joffrey is quite relevant as to whether she is a proper candidate to marry Tommen. Â Might want to research the Â sckism Â between the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church caused by the Pope's refusal to annul the marriage between Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon, and the Church of England's subsequent declaration that the marriage was void (since Catherine had previously married Henry's brother;under circumstances in which the consummation of Â that marriage was highly problematic) .
3489	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-15	Agreed. If Tommen had kept reading, he probably would have gone on to say, "...and I King Tommen, the First of My Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, declare my mother Cersei Lannister to be a spoiled brat who needs to listen to her father and do as she's told."LOL.
3490	Eddard the Builder	2014-05-16	Probably, that just makes it an even better snub to Cersei. Â Still though didn't he dismiss her from the Small Council in the books?
3491	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-05-16	Â 
Actually having been Joffrey's Queen might, but for the fact that the Lannister's totally control the small council, might have given Â Margary a decent argument why she would have deserved to be named Regent.Â 


Â 
Nope. The only way Marg would be Queen Regent is if she had given birth. Without a child she would never be Regent.
Â 
Upon Joff's death she becomes dowager Queen - purely titular with no power.
3492	Mad Monkey	2014-05-16	You don't have to give birth to be a regent. Regents simply rule in place of a minor king; Robert wanted to name Eddard Joffrey's regent and Kevan wanted to be Tommen's regent despite not having personally given birth to the reigning king.There's no way the Lannisters would allow Margaery to be Tommen's regent but if they did lose their minds they could technically do it.
3493	ground_control	2014-05-16	Agreed. If Tommen had kept reading, he probably would have gone on to say, "...and I King Tommen, the First of My Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, declare my mother Cersei Lannister to be a spoiled brat who needs to listen to her father and do as she's told."


And to start with, she is to marry a suitable Lord and have children that at least remotely resemble somebody in the Lord's family.
3494	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-05-17	You don't have to give birth to be a regent. Regents simply rule in place of a minor king; Robert wanted to name Eddard Joffrey's regent and Kevan wanted to be Tommen's regent despite not having personally given birth to the reigning king.There's no way the Lannisters would allow Margaery to be Tommen's regent but if they did lose their minds they could technically do it.


Â 
Indeed.Â 
Â 
But Margaery wouldÂ never have been regent after Joffrey's death. Her marriage to Joffrey for 5 minutes gave her absolutely zero claim to the power of regency.
3495	Mad Monkey	2014-05-17	Indeed.Â Â But Margaery wouldÂ never have been regent after Joffrey's death. Her marriage to Joffrey for 5 minutes gave her absolutely zero claim to the power of regency.That's true, but that's more because she's just a kid herself rather than because of her marriage. If she had been married to Joffrey for five years, the council would have still likely chosen an older adult leader like Tywin or Mace.A regent is basically like a castellan or a lord protector; they don't have to have any relationship to the king or any place in the line of succession. (In fact, it's probably better if they don't) Robb puts Ser Rodrik Cassel in charge of Bran and Winterfell in his absence not because Rodrik has any familial ties with himself or his family but because of Rodrik's age, stature, and experience. It's not about claims at all; Robb could have named any trusted adult leader to that position.
3496	Eddard the Builder	2014-05-18	Show Joffrey has also come of age, so Marg becoming Regent was never a thing. Â I think that's why Oberyn says "former Queen Regent."
3497	Thelastactionhero	2014-05-11	So I enjoyed this episode quite a lot, and I have very few complaints regarding these scenes with Stannis and Davos. He seems much more determined, and Davos' speech to the Iron Bank went a long way in reminding the audience that there's more to him than religous fanaticism and lust for power. I feel like getting him away from Mel for a couple scenes was a really smart move, as he doesn't seem like so much of a puppet when they're apart. I think this foreshadows him getting his mojo back when we start heading north, and I'm feeling extremely optimistic for epiosode 9. I've certainly been one of the moral vocal oppositions to this adaptation, as of season 3, but I really think they're starting to have him make a turn around. I certainly would have liked to have seen Stannis and Davos interacting with one another a bit more, maybe rekindling their friendship, but unfortunately their relationship has never been all that warm in the television series, and we'll just have to live with that as a different interpretation of their dynamic. He's certainly becoming more nuanced again, albeit slowly, and that's really all any of us have ever wanted. If this is indeed a redemption arc we're headed for, they need to do a bit more in order to balance out the various atrocities he's committed or attempted to, but I'm hopeful that we're gonna get back to a greyer, more lawful neutral character alignment moving forward. And with all that being said, have at it.

Â 
On the other hand, what does it say about Stannis that someone as amazing as Davos is fanatically devoted to him?
Â 
I didn't mind Davos giving the big speech, since Stannis does not do big speeches--especially not about how awesome he is--and Stannis does not beg. I don't believe he would go any further than asserting his claim as the rightful one, which he did.

He probably won't be able to take every soldier from Dragonstone with him. And even if he does get a boost in troops, 8,000 against 100,000 is still a pretty hefty win. I'm not worried about the numbers so much, it's more about how they portray his victory cinematically that matters.

Agreed, but his victory isn't just about him riding to save the realm. It's also about him showing himself as a great tactician and commander. And out of the 100k Wildings I think only 20-30k of them are fighters in the books if I'm not mistaken.

You're totally right, but the show canon is playing fast and loose with troop numbers, seeing as they've played up how hopelessly outnumbered the Night's Watch is. At least from the dialogue given, we're supposed to get the impression that there's 100k soldiers marching on the Wall, which bodes well for showing Stannis as a competent battle commander, which was of course played up tonight in Davos' speech.
3522	Wookiee	2014-05-11	Well, its not like a 100% good scene.
Â 
Â 
IB is left as pretty dumb. They are playing both sides now? of course Cersei wont pay them is they back Stannis.


Â 
It's not Cersei. Â It's the crown, and Tywin. Â Also, you pay the Iron Bank. Â EVERYONE pays the Iron Bank. Â Remember that it's been stated that people have killed themselves and disowned their families when they couldn't pay the Iron Bank. Â I don't think the IB really cares if the Lannisters and the Iron Throne *want* to pay. Â They have people for that.
Â 
IB's only concern is whether the people they're loaning money to will be able to pay it back. Â 
Â 
And I loved Stannis in this one. Â He was so very Stannis. Â You have to remember the core of Stannis is that he's the rightful king, and the "Baratheons" are all disgusting pretenders. Â He expects everyone to understand that, because it's amazingly bloody simple. Â "King died. Â Next oldest son becomes King. Â How is this hard for you?" Â 
Â 
But yeah, Davos. Â Stannis without Davos is screwed. Â
3523	Stannis-the-Mannis	2014-05-11	The IB can use the line of credit to Stannis as leverage on the Lannisters. "Pay up or we'll forward this guy more gold and really turn him into a problem for you"
Â 
It's annoying that Stannis never comes up with any bright ideas of his own in the show, but this scene didn't call for him to do it. It would have been out of place if he playing himself up to the bankers, that just isn't what he does.Â 
Â 
If anything, it was nice for Davos to remind non-book readers why he's with Stannis in the first place. Most people have no idea why such a nice guy is allied to the brainless witless loser that show Stannis was turned into.

Â 
I think you're supposed to deduce, even though they kind of spell it out for you, that the IB doesn't believe the Iron Throne is paying them back, probably because they haven't yet and Tywin is near the end of his life. So like typical IB mentality they'll aid a man to take over who will pay them back. That's the point, they're convinced Stannis will pay them if they help him. Not so different from the books except that the Lannisters haven't outright refused them yet which is honestly sort of evident anyways since they've been indebted for so long already.

This. Which is why it'll be all the more surprising for the Unsullied when this douchebag/puppet they haven't cared about since season 2 starts kicking ass and taking names up north. Saving the Wall is going to be his turning point. I am now 100% convinced. They might make him look more evil than they should once he starts intervening in the politics of the Night Watch but right now I dn't even give a shit, because its just so refreshing to see him hanging out with Davos and not being shown as merely a religous fanatic.

3529	Thelastactionhero	2014-05-11	Also, because no one has commented on this yet, I think Davos is almost certainly confirmed as going to the Wall with the rest of Team Dragonstone. It's way too late in the season to introduce the Manderly plotline, and if they keep it at all, it won't be until early in season 5. I'm really excited for the possibility of a Davos-Jon dialogue, because they're two characters we never see together. Still leaves open the possibility for the cart before the horse line too. They've kept a lot of Stannis' more important lines, even if they have changed the context here and there to make him look like a dick, so I think we might at least get some version of it in episode 10.

Â I can't help but think D&D are going to twist his arrival at the Wall and put him in conflict with Jon...like it will be Mel and Stannis invading the Wall and imposing their own kind of tyranny up there until Jon "tricks" Stannis into attacking Winterfell (they'll probably skip Moat Caitlin)
3531	Darkbringer	2014-05-11	Stephen Dillane is the shit. It's the writing that's the problem. Oddly enough, the nuance that's missing from the writing is only mildly tolerable because of the complexity he brings to the character in his performance.


Yeah totally agree. Dillane nails what he's given, but you cant make silk handkerchief out of a sow's ear. Poor Stannis, he's definitely had the Denethor treatment here (x 10).

No treatment is as bad as what Jackson did to Denethor. At least with Stannis we have some scenes (such as those with Shireen, and when he frees Davos from the dungeons) highlighting that he's a conflicted moral figure, and not just an unrepetent tyrant. I will say that like Stannis, Denethor's sense of duty to the realm was replaced almost entirely with lust for power, but the difference is that Stannis is still a competent commander, at least during season 2. Denethor on the other hand doesn't know where his armies are, doesn't want to call to Gondor for aid, and is actually using the the lost seeing stones to spy on those he thinks are trying to usurp his reign. In the books, Denethor drives himself insane trying to SAVE Gondor using the Palantri, and has been actively fighting Mordor his entire life. It's even mentioned that he's a seasoned warrior, who only gave up a more proactive role on the field in order to better rule the kingdom. Instead we get a guy sending Faramir on suicide missions, (that are tactically sound in the books) and eating chicken while his troops get murked. I think that while Stannis has been given the short end of the stick where writing is concerned, he's not so far gone that he can't be redeemed. It all depends on how the shit at Castle Black goes down. The showrunners haven't proven to me that they intend to completely betray the books, which is why I think that Jon's POV, where he comes to sympathize with Stannis and his cause, is going to go a long way in showing the Unsullied that there's a hell of a lot more to him than what we saw in season 3. I might be too optimistic at the moment, but whatever. Someone from our camp has to be.

They made it a point to show Wendel and his Merman brooch at the RW. They won't expect anyone to remember him, but they'll flash back to him before the episode starts when necessary.Â

For some reason I thought he sent Davos immediately to White Harbor when Stannis goes to the Wall, which is why there's no Davos-Jon interactions. Either way, it's clear he'll have a more active role there before being sent on his mission, whatever that may be in this adaptation.
3538	LilJonUmber	2014-05-11	They're portraying Stannis just fine. I watched the first two seasons -- LOVED Stannis -- and then read all the books before the premiere of season 3.Â 
Â 
Sure, a lot of his sharp retorts got left on the cutting room floor, but this is TV--they have to surprise you when he shows up at the Wall and is heroic...it makes for good theatre.Â 
Â 
Most simply won't like him because he lacks charisma and charm. But those viewers still fail to realize that in GRRM's world, those types aren't meant to rule; they're meant for beheading.Â

I look for that everytime and I can never seem to find it. They're definitely covering their asses in case they decide to include them, but I'm not totally convinced they'll be present. Since Bran and Rickon or alive, Davos might get sent directly to find them from the Wall.

Nah, I hear ya. I just thought that Wendel's inclusion -- as superfluous and easy to miss as it was -- must be a SURE indication that they would be using it for future material.Â

I admit I laughed at this, but I think Tywin's point is you don't reason with the IB when you can't pay them back. Can threaten or buy off a rep to "forget" the debt. You owe you owe and they will collect and there is no reasoning with them.
3559	Rockroi	2014-05-12	If anything, it was nice for Davos to remind non-book readers why he's with Stannis in the first place....
Â 

Â 
Â 
And I think the problem that its now necessary to remind people of this ...Â 
Â 
As Stannis episodes go, this one was not offensive as much as it represented yet another "lost opportunity" to show the viewers what makes Stannis such a worthwhile leader; other than the Balckwater (and yes, I grant you, Stannis was 50000 kinds of bad-ass that episode) the show seems to go out of its way to show Stannis at his most petulant, most irritating, most weak. Â And to contrast that the show... has done almost nothing. Â 
Â 
Here, in Braavos, there was yet again an opportunity for Stannis to show the viewer his nature and what makes him a great leader. Â Instead? Â No signs of his iron-will; no sign of his ability to win over people who dislike him; no sign of his strength. Â I even thought I saw him sulk again... I mean, at least it was not as bad as Season 3 and Stannis did not beg the Iron Bank like he did Mel "Oh come on!!!! I'll be your friend!" Â 
Â 
And if the show DOES do a grand turn-around once Stannis hits the Wall, it may work, but they have to give it ROOM to work, and TIME and energy and the writing the character requires- these are things the show has NEVER done with Stannis. Â IT could still work. Â I just wish the show had STARTED this work earlier....Â

Introducing Bravos with Arya getting there and maybe approaching the temple in E10 would have been a nice way to get a interesting finale and create anticipation for next season.
Â 
I do have an issue with Bravos beeing placed so much north at the Essos coastline. The distance to be covered by ship is terrible long. This is of course not an issue of the show. Is there any story of something like a gulfstream? Otherwise the climate should be almost like the north of Westeros and sailing there would be a pain too.
Â 
I am unsure about all this bad invention of storyline for the show. What is Asha/Yara doing there? IsnÂ´t there enough material already? Personally I would go along if they drop Miss Poole as fake Arya from the show and just invent other reasons for actions.

While discussing Dany at Tywin's small council meeting they brought up Jorah. Tywin then tells Mace to "fetch" his quill and ink. Me thinks, Tywin snitches him out...

He only appears in three chapters on Dragonstone, which they somehow managed to severely cut, and each chapter, I feel, has a lot of powerful scenes and lines that tell you more about Stannis than any other series of chapters.
Â 
"Then we will make new lords."
"I chose blood over honour."
"I never bested him at anything. The Lord of Light should have made Robert his champion. Why me?"
"I know the cost! Â ...Â I saw a king, a crown of fire on his brows, burning... burning, Davos."
"Swear it on your life, for I promise, you shall die by inches if you lie."
Â 
And then there's the ending, as well.
Â 
Yet, with almost an entire season's worth of free time to showcase some of these aspects, they instead show that Stannis is... frustrated he isn't king, Braavos version. Gee, hadn't nailed that part down.
Â 
And what's this about having four thousand soldiers and 33 ships? That's more men and ships than he had in the books. What has he been doing?Â 
Â 


In this episode Stannis proves he'd be utterly screwed without Davos around.
Stannis - "Blah blah blah, my rights, the law, and so on."
Â 
IB: "Nope. Not impressed."
Â 
Davos: "Well, you see guys ..."
Â 
... and 10 minutes later, they have enough gold to hire some ships. Davos rocks !


Â 
Yes, lol, every good idea on Dragonstone needs to come from Davos. Defending Edric? Davos. Testing Melisandre? Davos. Hiring sellswords? Davos. Winning the Iron Bank? Davos.

Â 
Â 
The show seems very generous about numbers of ships. In the books, Dany couldn't cobble together half a dozen ships when she needed some. In the show, Daario captures enough for her to load all her Unsullied in.Â

3570	Rhoynar	2014-05-12	I'm worried D&D may ruin Stannis still a bit more in the Wall. I have the bad feeling they may have him arrest Jon for being a traitor (maybe being convinced by Thorne and Slynt), and then next season have the Night's Watch elect Jon as the Lord Commander to piss Stannis off.

Â 
nah, come on. This show makes some dumb choices, but why would Stannis arrest Jon? And I think Jon will be elected LC this season anyway...
3572	Pepi	2014-05-12	Tbh, I don't really imagine Stannis saying anything after being turned down. Less so pleading for gold. Stan is imo not the person to ask for stuff. Sure, he'll go out of his way to make a point that something belongs to him (Storm's End (to Robert)/7 Kingdoms (to the rest of Westeros)), but this is not really the case here. And besides ... there were theories Stan had Asperger's. Him freezing when he has to ask people (he doesn't know and are not in any way inferior or in debt to him) for their help is something I can easily see happening. Â Â
3573	ground_control	2014-05-12	Remember, going to Braavos is Davos's idea. Â Stannis doesn't look mad, he just looks like they said what he expected they'd say after he said what he knew he'd say. Â If Stannis was better at dealing with people, he probably wouldn't have had to deal with his younger brother trying to steal his crown.
3574	Van West	2014-05-12	I honestly don't think we're going to get Stannis offering Jon Winterfell.
Â 
Which really sucks.

They will have Davos offering Jon Snow Winterfell.
3576	Van West	2014-05-12	MEL! MEL! MEL!
Â 
Davos: We shall march on Winterfell or die trying.Â 
Â 
Stannis: Am I even needed anymore?
3577	The Drunkard	2014-05-12	Will Stannis appear before episode 9?
Â 
For some reason I thought this episode was the last one before his arrival at the Wall, but that would be an awful cliffhanger.
3578	Sun	2014-05-12	The IB extending a loan to Stannis at this point in the story, while Tywin is still alive and upholding his obligations to the IB, does not make sense. Why endanger whatever payments they'll be getting from the Iron Throne while Tywin is in control by prolonging the war and further jeopardizing their investment by betting on Stannis, the much weaker opponent, surviving Tywin? What if Tywin kills Stannis? Who repays the IB their loan to Stannis? Shereen?Â 
Â 
In the books the IB turned to Stannis after Tywin's death and Cersie's refusal to honor the debt. That made sense. The way the show has done it does not, imo.

Â 
It's a preemptive move, as Davos pointed out. Once Tywin is dead (which might not be too far off given his age) the Lannister house will be under Cersei and Jaime's control who are completely incapable in financial matters. He also made it clear that Stannis was in his prime and losing a war against Tywin was unlikely given he had the backing.

Â 
It doesn't work. By loaning money to Stannis, you prolong the war, further bleeding the IT and the Lannister's coffers, thus jeopardizing their own payments.
Also, why risk betting on an unknown quantity like Stannis over a known quantity like Tywin, a man with whom the IB has dealt for years, since the time of the Mad King? It's a gigantic risk for the IB to take. Especially considering the Tyrell alliance and the state of Stannis' affairs at the moment, the absence of backing for him from the other houses of Westeros, and his own lack of a male heir.Â 
Â 
It does not make sense for any bank to take such a risk. They've made a heavy bet on the Lannisters keeping the IT, a bet that's being honored by a man they know, why risk it by backing Stannis and having Tywin find out? Why risk it by prolonging the war and weakening the Lannister's hold on the IT?
Â 
It doesn't make sense.
Â 
Â 
Once Cersie reneges on the loan, then it makes perfect sense for the IB to turn to Stannis, not before.Â

Unlikely, but I think Stannis will quickly explain what happened at the IB to Jon in the finale episode (before, hopefully, the Winterfell proposal by Ygritte's pyre).

I don't think the Iron Bank cares too much WHEN the loan is paid off. Only that it is eventually repaid. A longer period without repayment just means more interest.
Â 
As Davos points out, Stannis isn't an unknown quality, he is (at least in show universe) the only military commander on the same level as Tywin. Tywin is old. He could die, either by accident or scheming. Then the Lannister regime is screwed.
Â 
This way either the Lannister win and the Iron Bank writes off the Stannis gold as a loss. But if he does win, then it's insurance on getting the rest of the debt paid.

Â 
No he is not. Especially not in the show's universe. All we saw in the show is an unlikable Stannis who burns people, and is so hated by the rest of Westeros that when his brother dies, most of his army, and the houses backing them turn to the Lannisters. A man who fell for Tyrion's trap at Blackwater and was taken by surprise and routed by Tywin.
It was obvious from the scene that the IB knows little of Stannis, and what they knew wasn't complimentary. Are we supposed to believe that they would take a known smuggler's character testimonial?
Â 
Also, as things stand, Stannis is far more likely to die at war than Tywin is likley to die in KL. Add to it that from prior evidence, there absolutely nothing to suggest that the realm would rally to Stannis' side if and when Tywin dies.
The IT still has the Tyrrels with all their wealth and armies, as well as the armies of the IT and those of the Lannisters. Stannis has nothing but 4000 soldiers, and whatever sellsword company the IB money can buy him. It's a losing hand.Â 
Â 
After Stannis goes to the wall, rallies the Northmen around him, gets a possible influx from the Wildings, then he's a viable bet against Cersie, especially once the fractures between the Tyrells and the Lannisters start surfacing.Â 
Â 
In the show the IB backing Stannis doesn't make sense whichever way you slice it. It's just not sound business. You do not back the weaker side and in doing so risk your existing relationship with the stronger side without a powerful reason. Tywin maybe dying is not reason enough, and it certainly isn't a new reason. Tywin is 67 years old this year, he was 65 years old when the war started, and the IB didn't see a risk in extending loans to IT then.Â 
Â 
Side note: Ofcourse in the book we can add further speculation based reasoning as to why IB is backing stannis that is not relevant to the show at the moment.Â

Good god, if I never saw the word 'agency' in a literary context again, I would be a happy man.
3586	Darkbringer	2014-05-12	No treatment is as bad as what Jackson did to Denethor. At least with Stannis we have some scenes (such as those with Shireen, and when he frees Davos from the dungeons) highlighting that he's a conflicted moral figure, and not just an unrepetent tyrant. I will say that like Stannis, Denethor's sense of duty to the realm was replaced almost entirely with lust for power, but the difference is that Stannis is still a competent commander, at least during season 2. Denethor on the other hand doesn't know where his armies are, doesn't want to call to Gondor for aid, and is actually using the the lost seeing stones to spy on those he thinks are trying to usurp his reign. In the books, Denethor drives himself insane trying to SAVE Gondor using the Palantri, and has been actively fighting Mordor his entire life. It's even mentioned that he's a seasoned warrior, who only gave up a more proactive role on the field in order to better rule the kingdom. Instead we get a guy sending Faramir on suicide missions, (that are tactically sound in the books) and eating chicken while his troops get murked. I think that while Stannis has been given the short end of the stick where writing is concerned, he's not so far gone that he can't be redeemed. It all depends on how the shit at Castle Black goes down. The showrunners haven't proven to me that they intend to completely betray the books, which is why I think that Jon's POV, where he comes to sympathize with Stannis and his cause, is going to go a long way in showing the Unsullied that there's a hell of a lot more to him than what we saw in season 3. I might be too optimistic at the moment, but whatever. Someone from our camp has to be. Actually, I agree, more or less.Maybe I exaggerated, but i do think that the abominable ShowStannis moments do have a Denthorish tang to them. I actually am somewhat optimistic too, a part of me hopes its just the crudeness of telly that makes them do it. The motive i guess, as you mentioned, would be to tear him down just to build him up. An even more optimistic (unhinged?) part of me asks; why has Dillane given practically no interviews? Why are they going to such odds to make him unsympathetic? D&D know the ending, is this an attempt to distract our attention from the final victor? Optimistic much?
3587	FNF	2014-05-12	I'm seeing a lot of comments suggesting the the IB scene somehow portrayed him as weak because he didn't really push the Iron Bank into believing that he is the best etc. However, I think it showed that he was 1) Not particularly enthusiastic about this idea and 2) That he didn't feel as if heÂ had to convince/beg. If anything, the fact he doesn't get down on his hands and knees and lets someone else do the talking instead showed that he was unwilling to go that low. Hell, the way he looked at the bench that the bankers offered him to take a seat on said it all really. He is a King deserving of a throne, not a begger.

Why pressure and antagonize someone who just last episode finished lecturing his daughter on why the Iron Bank MUST be payed?

Â 
Davos covered this. It's not Tywin that the Iron Bank doubts. It's who would be in charge if Tywin dies. So the Iron Bank puts the screws to him to get as much as they can before that happens.
3590	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-05-12	This was a good Stannis episode. He is much more interesting and enjoyable when he's away from Melissandre. I love Davos and this episode showed why one should love Davos.
3591	salmonsnake	2014-05-12	In terms of Stannis seeming weak, I think that's simply the result of the uncanningly modern-seeming setting of the bank, clashing with the notions of honour, pride and prestige that in other environments are easier to exhibit. He acted like a an obsoletely pompous king might act in a bank. (But can't know kings like that are extinct and banks, on the other hand, prevail)
3592	Fat Trell	2014-05-12	So what is Stannis going to do with his money? Re-hire Saan. Is he going to hire sellswords? Or just passage to the Wall?
3593	Batman	2014-05-12	Stephen Dillane is the shit. It's the writing that's the problem. Oddly enough, the nuance that's missing from the writing is only mildly tolerable because of the complexity he brings to the character in his performance.

3594	Lord Thornhart	2014-05-12	D$D are both huge cunts.
Â 
I lost faith in TV Stannis awhile ago. His complete belief in everything Meli says is completely out of character. Not only does he think the Red God will make him King, but he also thought the dragon statues would come alive and fight for him? Actually thinking killing his nephew will do anything, showing a lust for power and not a desire for law, completely removing his legendary sense of humor,Â going along with the burnings, wanting toÂ rape Meli, wanting to kill Meli,Â treatingÂ Davos like a bitch and not a friend, wearing black all the time so he looks evil, doing thatÂ fucking tongue thing, etc.
Â 
This is all bullshit. Dumb&Dumber clearly want him to be evil, I don't see that changing. I Alliser to take all of Stannis' cool moments at the Wall, since he seems to be more sympathetic in the TV show. I'm sure Davos will join at the Wall, so that way he can explain the everyone why Stannis is King and his story for him, while Stannis just looks off into the distance evilly. But I'm sure they will make up for it by giving Stannis some new scenes. Maybe he can order someone likable like Pep to be burned to assert his authority and show everyone how much he loves R'hllor. They can also cut out his interrogator and just give his lines to Stannis.Â  can't wait to see Stannis threaten to rape Asha, it will totally make up for all the good Stannis moments cut out.

That's the thing though, Tywin CAN'T pay the Iron Bank. House Lannister is running on empty and the Crown is equally in massive debt due to Littlefinger's borrowing from...the Iron Bank. The Iron Bank may not know about the former but they certainly know about the latter.
Â 
Tywin knows they have to pay the Iron Bank but they wouldn't keep bringing up how they need to pay it if they were secure in their ability to conjure enough gold to handle it. Gold which they don't have.

Â 
The Iron Bank sees Tywin's house in ruins and predicts they will default on their loans, so they give Stannis enough time to build his army.Â  With Stannis as a threat, the Lannisters will be forced to pay their debts immediately perhaps in some other form of capital.
Say, I dunno, large territories donated to their Iron Bank or promises of their revenues or a city or something. The Catholic Church had the former done to them but mostly people had acreditions for other reasons.
3600	jons nissa	2014-05-12	Â I can't help but think D&D are going to twist his arrival at the Wall and put him in conflict with Jon...like it will be Mel and Stannis invading the Wall and imposing their own kind of tyranny up there until Jon "tricks" Stannis into attacking Winterfell (they'll probably skip Moat Caitlin)


Â 
stannis did impose his own tyranny up there. i doubt that jon will need to trick stannis into attacking winterfell. he only does it to create momentum in his campaign and win northern loyalty not because he was concerned about their cause.
Â 


I am not enjoying how they've restructured ASOS when it comes to Stannis. He only appears in three chapters on Dragonstone, which they somehow managed to severely cut, and each chapter, I feel, has a lot of powerful scenes and lines that tell you more about Stannis than any other series of chapters.
Â 
"Then we will make new lords."
"I chose blood over honour."
"I never bested him at anything. The Lord of Light should have made Robert his champion. Why me?"
"I know the cost! Â ...Â I saw a king, a crown of fire on his brows, burning... burning, Davos."
"Swear it on your life, for I promise, you shall die by inches if you lie."


Â 
i agree, these lines create a sense of stannis that the show has failed to replicate but many of the unsullied did pick up on the overall tone of the character.

Stannis and Jon butted heads, but they ultimately reached compromises with one another through relatively even handed dialogues. It's more than a little obvious that Jon comes to respect and sympathize with Stannis following his depature from the Wall, despite them getting off to a bit of a rocky start. Unfortunately, a lot of Jon's real feelings about Stannis are internal, so the showrunners definitely have a prime excuse to take the nuance out of their dynamic in favor of one that is more overtly negative. I'm started to regain a little faith in the showrunners abilities after last episode though, so we'll have to wait and see.

Tywins expects the Tyrells would refinance at least part of the debt with the IB, since they are know invested in the Iron Throne. A fact the Iron Banks representatives forget when confronted with Master Salesman Davos.
Â 
The catch is that, should the loan they've given Stannis is made public knowledge, the Iron Throne has every reason to default on them and money itself is not going to make Stannis win the war. In the books, the IB loan is a desperate gamble. Here it's a tricky business which could tarnish their very important reputation. It's not just that the Iron Bank will get its due no matter what. It's that if you borrow from the IB and the IB feels you can not pay, they will back your enemies no matter how hard you try to pay.

Definitely a grudging respect but that's what makes it so interesting for me. It's actually way more interesting than them overtly liking one another. I just think it would be an easy thing to skew on television, so I'm really hoping they handle that dynamic with a bit of care.

Although they talk more about the Iron Bank than Stannis, this is quite possibly the most even handed they've been towards Team Dragonstone ever. When they talk like this, it gives me hope they'll be able to handle him better going forward, and that they aren't quite as clueless as some of us think they are.
3608	Mark the Red	2014-05-12	Â 
It doesn't work. By loaning money to Stannis, you prolong the war, further bleeding the IT and the Lannister's coffers, thus jeopardizing their own payments.
Also, why risk betting on an unknown quantity like Stannis over a known quantity like Tywin, a man with whom the IB has dealt for years, since the time of the Mad King? It's a gigantic risk for the IB to take. Especially considering the Tyrell alliance and the state of Stannis' affairs at the moment, the absence of backing for him from the other houses of Westeros, and his own lack of a male heir.Â 
Â 
It does not make sense for any bank to take such a risk. They've made a heavy bet on the Lannisters keeping the IT, a bet that's being honored by a man they know, why risk it by backing Stannis and having Tywin find out? Why risk it by prolonging the war and weakening the Lannister's hold on the IT?
Â 
It doesn't make sense.
Â 
Â 
Once Cersie reneges on the loan, then it makes perfect sense for the IB to turn to Stannis, not before.Â 


Â 
We don't know how much the IB loaned to Stannis for us to say this . Â  It is not uncommon for banks to hedge their bets. Â  Keep funding the Lannisters say (90%) but hedging it by giving Stannis a (10%) one time loan just in case Davos is right.
Â 
I suspect that is what the IB did. Â Smart move if so. Â  The relatively small loan to Stannis serves many purposes and will pay off huge if Davos is right.
Â 
The point I am trying to make is are we totally sure that the IB is strictly an either / or lending institution? Â Why can't they do both?

3609	Guard of the Rainking	2014-05-12	Too bad, that they're not doing the refusal and cliffhanger thing, but it's still cool. If I understood it right Stannis has 31 ships and 4 000 men at Dragonstone and Salla's fleet + one of his ships and whatever amount of sellswords he bought at Braavos. That's quite at lot compared to what Stannis had in the books against Mance, but then again Mance has an army of 100 000 in the show. I don't see much problem with this episode's Stannis. He didn't beg which was the most important part.
3610	~DarkHorse~	2014-05-12	I don't understand why they aren't hyping Stannis up, let alone notÂ making his likable/admirable traits in the books show. He is one of the most interesting characters with his dry humour, determination (can stand on his own bloodyÂ feet without Mel and Davos) and his conflict over his duty. He is also one of the main players left in the game and rightful King.
Â 
He was fine in Season 2 but Season 3 screwed him over big style and he doesn't seem to be improving that much.
Â 
Personally, Stannis is the character that cracks me up the most with his dry humour but the show has missed out half of his good quotes already. I can only hope they remember to give him some wit during his Wall/Jon scenes.
Â 
He is pretty much the third wheel of his own story.
Â 
Although, hats off to Stephen Dillane, he is an amazing actor with great facial expressions. I just wish they would give him more to work with.
Â 
I honestly hate ranting about this, it gets repetitive and whiny but I do genuinely feel cheated for the Unsullied viewers who give 'zero shits' about him and genuinely see him as a Dick.Â He is much more complex than that!

It's mind boggling to almost every fan of the character. But there's still time! I'm trying not to get too excited, since I got let down so much last season, but I really think we might start seeing more of those likeable qualities coming out soon, considering what a large role he plays in aDwD and the rest of SoS.
3612	sati	2014-05-12	I think they are underplaying him for a huge payoff in ep.9 and 10. At least I really, really, hope that's what they're doing.

As many have speculated they might be trying to play him as this insignificant boring character until he gets to the Wall. I've read many reviews of episode 6 now, and many of the unsullied reviewers call him a wooden character or don't even mention him. After he has saved the Wall and offered Jon Winterfell I doubt that many will disqualify him as a wooden character. If we retrospectively look at his scenes this season they're actually pretty likable. E2: his face during the burning ceremony, "I hate a good many things, but I suffer them all the same", "She's my daughter. You will not strike her." E3: "They don't have enough men between them to raid a pantry", "The Golden Company?!" (Stannis has almost no money and Davos' solution is to hire the most expensive sellsword company lol) E6: "More than any man living" and Davos' speech. There's a lot to like even in the S3: scenes like E5 family interaction and E8 Davos jail talk.

See I'm not sure I really agree with this. For myself and a lot of other book readers I speak with, Stannis was not much liked until the end of ASOS. He came off as a entitled "Mine by Rights!" whiner, and a bit of a religious zealot type blindly following this Melisandre chick who most had quite a few doubts about to begin with. The whole burning of Idols and what not, along with burning people (including relatives), made him seem.. pretty unlikeable.
Â 
I think show watchers (Unsullied) more or less have the correct feelings towards Stannis, at least in regards to how they should currently view him.
Â 
Everything changes when Stannis saves the wall. He went from generally unliked, to amiable. Then from Amiable to fan favorite in ADWD. He's now one of my favorite people and I think this is the case for plenty of readers. Imo the bias of their current Stannis views kind of blind them when watching the show.
Â 
Maybe that's just me, or maybe the Show runners really are just going to whiff on his character, but as things currently are, there is certainly time to bring him around in a very similar fashion to how we experienced him in the books.Â
3615	Guard of the Rainking	2014-05-12	Here's a thought. Maybe we'll get a scene of Stannis and Davos trying to get the Golden Company. We saw gilded skulls in one of the production videos and Davos already mentioned them. Also Team Dragonstone isn't in a goof cliffhanger stage now, and the Wall arrival would come right out of the left field, and I doubt many of the everyday Unsullied remember the S3E10 moment, so it needs to referenced at least ones before E9 IMO.

The flipside of this is that while Stannis wasn't a fan favoriteÂ  before he went north, the character had also never done anything quite as despicable as to make his transformation into a likeable character impossible. I can't say the same for the show. The burnings in the books are brutal, and it's a definite low point for his character, but changing the context of Alester Florent's execution just to make him look like an evil fanatic really crossed the line (burning the guy who wants to send your daughter off to your enemies so he can get his keep back is pretty legitimate causes for execution, though not neccessarily being burned alive). Season 3 takes his failings, simplifies them, and makes him look way worse and way more powerless than he ever was in the novels. His relationship with Mel is more evenhanded there, whereas here he really feels like her puppet most of the time. This is why so many of us are concerned, because to balance out how terrible they've made him look, they need to set him on a proper redemption arc where we see Stannis stand on his own two feet. This may or may not happen. If it does, these scenes will be more effective precisely because of how bad they've made him look previously, but if not, then they'll just be guilty of cheapening a great character for no reason. For what it's worth, I hope you're right, because all I want is for the show to continue to uphold the same high level of quality and professionalism I'd come to expect from seasons 1 and 2. This latest episode definitely has my hopes for a proper portrayal of Stannis rekindled.
3617	Sun	2014-05-12	Â 
We don't know how much the IB loaned to Stannis for us to say this . Â  It is not uncommon for banks to hedge their bets. Â  Keep funding the Lannisters say (90%) but hedging it by giving Stannis a (10%) one time loan just in case Davos is right.
Â 
I suspect that is what the IB did. Â Smart move if so. Â  The relatively small loan to Stannis serves many purposes and will pay off huge if Davos is right.
Â 
The point I am trying to make is are we totally sure that the IB is strictly an either / or lending institution? Â Why can't they do both?


Â 
Banks don't gamble, they hedge to limit their loss not to increase their profit.Â 
Â 
Why needlessly antagonize the IT, along with 2 of the most powerful families in Westeros, now? After it has won the war? Surely the time for the IB to hedge its bets was while the war was raging full swing and the outcome was still in question?Â 
Â 
And Stannis is not what I would call a hedge, certainly not at this juncture in the storyline. He's a huge gamble, with down far greater, and more likely than the up.Â 
Â 
The IB, if indeed a proper bank, should have done its risk assessment a long time ago, at the beginning of the war, and should have continued to do so all through. Nothing Davos told them is new information. It should not sway them. And as a risk, in his present state, Stannis is not worth taking. Let's not forget, if Stannis should for any reason whatsoever happen to die, his claim dies with him. And There will be no one to repay the bank its loan.Â 
Â 
We can argue this all day, and I still say the loan does not make sense. Simply put, Stannis is not a good credit risk at this juncture, and the IB has no incentive, or purpose, of its own to induce it to gamble on him.Â
3618	Pod The Impaler	2014-05-12	In the show the IB backing Stannis doesn't make sense whichever way you slice it. It's just not sound business. You do not back the weaker side and in doing so risk your existing relationship with the stronger side without a powerful reason.


Â 
Â 
Sure you do. You've never heard of corporations that back more than one side in an election, so they have an connections with whoever wins in the end? Happens all the time in real life.
Â 
The IB didn't give Stannis enough to finance a whole a war, just a small amount, enough to keep him going temporarily. Â 
Â 
Perhaps they are hedging their bets.Â Â  Perhaps they like chaos (where lords grow more in debt to them - this is Littlefinger style thinking). or perhaps they even figure Stannis will use that money to go fight the lannister-Tyrell alliance and get killed, ending the war that much faster so they can be repaid.
3619	The Fenris Wolf	2014-05-12	See I'm not sure I really agree with this. For myself and a lot of other book readers I speak with, Stannis was not much liked until the end of ASOS. He came off as a entitled "Mine by Rights!" whiner, and a bit of a religious zealot type blindly following this Melisandre chick who most had quite a few doubts about to begin with.

This is a really interesting point, and I hadn't considered it until you brought it up. Â I feel the same way about the character of Stannis. Â He definitely becomes more likeable as the books progress. Â By the time you see him at the Wall with Jon, and then marching south leading his army, you get a real sense of the man.
Â 
I thought this episode was great the way they portrayed him talking with the Iron Bank's people. Â There's this scene at the very beginning when they calmly walk in and sit down, then the guy looks at Stannis, smiles, and offers him a seat. Â You can practically see Stannis sizing him up and thinking, "You don't offer the king a seat! Â It's my seat bitch!" Â It was pretty awesome.
3620	Widows_Blood	2014-05-12	I think the IB lending money works quite well in this situation. Providing a small bridge loan to Stannis is problematic in the sense that he doesn't really have any way of paying it back at the moment. However, even if he were to die before paying it back, whatever loan was given could be enough to prolong the war. In turn that will force the Lannisters to borrow and spend more money, so whatever money was lost on Stannis, would be paid back through the act of prolonging the war. Even if the Lannisters were to learn of what the IB did, what re-course do they have? They still need money. Tywin cannot simply cut off payments to the IB without the IB completely throwing their resources behind Stannis fully.Â From an historical perspective this happens all the time, gun runners will often arm both sides of a conflict, nation-states do this all the time. War is an incredibly profitable enterprise in which individuals, organizations and nations have a deeply vested interest in.Â

3621	Bronn Urgundy	2014-05-12	I think something very important has been missed in this thread. Stannis' face pre-Davos speech and Stannis' face post Davos speech, Dillane is a fantastic actor, and all I could think was "is this the moment where Stannis finally rediscovers himself thanks to Davos?" Don't get me wrong, while Stannis was never the slobbering goof in the books that he is in the show, he did need to rediscover himself (something the haters completely miss, by the way) and it was thanks to Davos that he did so. The man sung his praises, blew his trumpet and single handedly reinvigorated his cause, not only that, but he talked about the Stannis that he knew, the Stannis Eddard Stark talked about in Season 1, not the Stannis that we've got to know in the show.
Â 
Call me over-optimistic, and maybe I am reading too much into Dillanes wonderful face, but he's always worth watching in these scenes. Please let me be right on this one, I've been hurt before, but I think this is just a different incarnation of Davos pulling Stannis out of his slump and bringing back a decent incarnation of the man.

Bryan Cogman answering some Stannis questions from an EW interview yesterday.
Â 
The Stannis storyline has been stuck with him fuming at his big table in Dragonstone for awhile. It must be fun to get him out and about again.
Absolutely. That was the idea. When we first broached the subject of bringing in the Iron Bank, for awhile the version was [Iron Bank representativeÂ Tycho Nestoris] would come to Dragonstone and meet on Stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099> turf. It just seemed like whenever we can open up this world and give the audience something new visually and take characters out of their comfort zone, the better. We thought it would be more dramatic and interesting to put Stannis in the position of having to go ask for a loan. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a humiliating situation. The Stannis storyline is certainly more of a slow burn, but it will pay off.
My impression of Stannis is that he would be a very just king, but would also be terrible at the job because has zero social game. How can you rule without any understanding other peopleâ<U+0080><U+0099>s needs and motivations?
Thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a valid question. Heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s learning, though. This was a teachable episode for him and another reason why he keeps Davos around even though they donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t see eye to eye and Davos commits what Stannis sees as a little treason now and then. Davos helps him face these hard truths and through Davos heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s slowly learning some lessons. Here he has to swallow his pride. It was great fun having [actors] Liam Cunningham,Stephen DillaneÂ and Mark Gatiss all on the set in the same scene. They have very different personas and different ways of working and it was great to see them bounce off each other.

It was by James Hibberd and hes read the books. I don't think he's particularly wrong in saying that Stannis would be a just king but he is lacking in qualities that allow him to relate to others or better understand their motivations. For what its worth I think he gets better at that in ADwD but its still not a personal strength of his.Â
3625	King Tommen	2014-05-12	It's the same reasons everyone in AGOT immediately dismisses the notion that he would be the best choice for king once Robert dies and Ned starts pushing for Stannis as the rightful heir. The argument has always been that he's a brilliant battle commander and a just ruler but he doesn't understand or care about how people will react to the things that he does which cause the vast majority to reject his personality. He needs a guy like Davos to advise him and champion his cause to others because he's too rigid to emphasize with those he would rule over.

Â 
No I don't think he's wrong in saying that either, I think he's spot on, I was just hoping that that observation came from a show only watcher, because I think they might not think of him as just, or even decent, what with all the religious stuff and general weirdness and all that "me want Throne, bang me Mel, ooh Robb Stark dead!" with show Stannis' character.

Â 
As I said to Widows Blood, I was hoping that it came from a show only watcher, because then I would feel less vindicated with my feelings that they're not showing that side of Stannis at all. Instead sticking with all that bad traits, turned up to 11, but its alright because he likes Shireen guys...

He's now one of my favorite people and I think this is the case for plenty of readers. Imo the bias of their current Stannis views kind of blind them when watching the show.
Â 
Maybe that's just me, or maybe the Show runners really are just going to whiff on his character, but as things currently are, there is certainly time to bring him around in a very similar fashion to how we experienced him in the books.Â 


Â 
I do initially agree with this. I wasn't that much into Stannis until he got to the Wall.
Â 
However, on re-read I picked up on his dry humour and more human side (conflict over killing relatives and belief in Davos) and appreciated him more. However, the problem is that these things don't exist on the show (or have been downplayed) so when people re-watch they won't be picking it up. He will become a better guy when he gets to the Wall, before that he was simplyÂ a Dick and boring.

Â I think they might not think of him as just, or even decent, what with all the religious stuff and general weirdness and all that "me want Throne, bang me Mel, ooh Robb Stark dead!" with show Stannis' character.
Â 


Â 
but these are a big part of his characterization! he's not just a great general and just man. he's also on a quest to the bitter end for the iron throne, so yes, me want throne. and without the shadow babies, his whole story would be different and most likely over as he had a significantly smaller army so yes, bang me mel. and finally, he is not sympathetic to robb's death, regardless of how horrendous it was that it occurred after guest right had been in effect (he wasn't sympathetic to any stark, for that matter) so yes, ooh robb stark dead. he only saw robb as another pretender so we're not told that he had a thought about it other than "wow. those leeches are really working!". why should the show gloss over any of this? he'd have very little story at this point without them.
Â 
and yes, he goes to the wall and then to winterfell and that's all great but without the things you mention here, i'm not even sure that would have been an option for him.Â

Â 
I don't want them to gloss it over, I don't even really mind that they've amped it up, the show is the show, the books are the books, I've grown to accept that. But, what I do mind, is that by amping up this side and toning down the sense of justice and other good points (up until this point) you don't get a fair balance on the character, you get the whiney borderline religious zealot most show fans think Stannis is, where the words "justice" and "duty" although mentioned fleetingly by the character are among the last words you'd use to describe him with, generally falling behind "arsehole" "zealot" and "puppet". And perhaps even "cruel" and book Stannis may have small parts of the former three in him, but he is not cruel.
Â 
Its not the bad I have a problem with, its a lack of the good.
Â 
But hey, he likes Shireen...

Â 
Not necessarily. The storyline was mainly included to give Stannis something to do this season, and the men the money will buy will only go towards helping him defeat the wildlings, as well as probably taking the place of the mountain clans that Stannis recruits to fight the Boltons.
Â 
So I don't think what happens in TWOW had any effect on this storyline. They could work around it either way.
3633	Thelastactionhero	2014-05-12	Bryan Cogman answering some Stannis questions from an EW interview yesterday.
Â 
The Stannis storyline has been stuck with him fuming at his big table in Dragonstone for awhile. It must be fun to get him out and about again.
Absolutely. That was the idea. When we first broached the subject of bringing in the Iron Bank, for awhile the version was [Iron Bank representativeÂ Tycho Nestoris] would come to Dragonstone and meet on Stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099> turf. It just seemed like whenever we can open up this world and give the audience something new visually and take characters out of their comfort zone, the better. We thought it would be more dramatic and interesting to put Stannis in the position of having to go ask for a loan. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a humiliating situation. The Stannis storyline is certainly more of a slow burn, but it will pay off.
My impression of Stannis is that he would be a very just king, but would also be terrible at the job because has zero social game. How can you rule without any understanding other peopleâ<U+0080><U+0099>s needs and motivations?
Thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a valid question. Heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s learning, though. This was a teachable episode for him and another reason why he keeps Davos around even though they donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t see eye to eye and Davos commits what Stannis sees as a little treason now and then. Davos helps him face these hard truths and through Davos heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s slowly learning some lessons. Here he has to swallow his pride. It was great fun having [actors] Liam Cunningham,Stephen DillaneÂ and Mark Gatiss all on the set in the same scene. They have very different personas and different ways of working and it was great to see them bounce off each other.


This is huge. I am officially hopeful now for some explosive awesome shit come episode 9 and at least something close to resembling a redemption arc: "The Stannis storyline is certainly more of a slow burn, but it will pay off." And, more than that, Cogman acknowledges that Stannis is learning. This is something we see in the books too in the latter half of SoS. Gotta say, my faith is more or less restore. (In Bryan Cogman, anyway)
3634	Konradsmith	2014-05-12	^I'm glad someone posted that tidbit. I thought you'd all like it. The key line from Cogman is "The Stannis storyline is more of a slow burn, but it will pay off."

3635	ToTheWolves	2014-05-12	Though stannis isn't one of my favorite characters. I honestly didn't start liking him in the books until he reached the wall.which I think was a HUGE point for him & the books. Sooo I'm really hoping that they let stannis have his moment of glory when he reaches the wall "STANNIS! STANNIS! STANNIS!" I had chills when i read that part I hope they don't change it!
3636	Aldi_AA	2014-05-12	So does last night mean that in TWOW we will see Â Ser Justin Massey succeed in his mission?
I was thinking the same thing it could be one of two things he either gets a bunch of sellswords now and they cut Massey or what I think will happen is he only gets enough gold to hire a few sellswords and ships and when tycho goes to the wall later he gets the rest of the money and sends Massey on his mission.

That's because on your re-read you were already seeing him with different eyes, so you judge his personality based on deeds he had not done at that point yet. Before Stannis went to the Wall, I felt like putting my book down for a few hours every time I saw a Davos chapter. I didn't find that storyline very interesting, because I found the characters too isolated and boring, and after Cortnay Penrose's cheap death, arranged by Stannis himself, I kinda hated him for a bit. On my first re-read, everytime I saw Stannis in ACOK and ASOS I saw the Stannis from ADWD and TWOW, telling myself he was just misunderstood or misdirected, and then I became a Stanstan. On my second re-read, however, I tried to be less biased and then I realised that he's not really worthy of being a fan favorite before going to the Wall.
3638	jarl the climber	2014-05-12	I think something very important has been missed in this thread. Stannis' face pre-Davos speech and Stannis' face post Davos speech, Dillane is a fantastic actor, and all I could think was "is this the moment where Stannis finally rediscovers himself thanks to Davos?" Don't get me wrong, while Stannis was never the slobbering goof in the books that he is in the show, he did need to rediscover himself (something the haters completely miss, by the way) and it was thanks to Davos that he did so. The man sung his praises, blew his trumpet and single handedly reinvigorated his cause, not only that, but he talked about the Stannis that he knew, the Stannis Eddard Stark talked about in Season 1, not the Stannis that we've got to know in the show.
Â 
Call me over-optimistic, and maybe I am reading too much into Dillanes wonderful face, but he's always worth watching in these scenes. Please let me be right on this one, I've been hurt before, but I think this is just a different incarnation of Davos pulling Stannis out of his slump and bringing back a decent incarnation of the man.


He does sort of resemble Gene Kelly, the white guy who was in Enter The Dragon with Bruce Lee.
Â 


So does last night mean that in TWOW we will see Â Ser Justin Massey succeed in his mission?


Well they don't want Stannis to pull an army out of his ass out of nowhere in season 6, so they can establish that he has been hiring men since season 4, whether he sends a guy in season 5/6 to hire more that sort of coincides with Massey is possible I suppose but the show is not the book.Â

Looks like you might have been right all along man. Fingers crossed. I still think that Dillane is still a bit under utilized, and that they could have done a better job at showing the complexity of his moral conflict on Dragonstone, but if they pull this off, I'll be the first one to admit that maybe I jumped the gun readying the pitchfork and torches.

Sure you do. You've never heard of corporations that back more than one side in an election, so they have an connections with whoever wins in the end? Happens all the time in real life.
Â 
The IB didn't give Stannis enough to finance a whole a war, just a small amount, enough to keep him going temporarily. Â 
Â 
Perhaps they are hedging their bets.Â Â  Perhaps they like chaos (where lords grow more in debt to them - this is Littlefinger style thinking). or perhaps they even figure Stannis will use that money to go fight the lannister-Tyrell alliance and get killed, ending the war that much faster so they can be repaid.

After reading this, I appreciate the scene much more.
3649	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-05-13	They've been doing a lot of telling and not showing with Stannis on the show. Davos keeps saying all these amazing things about him, but it just makes him look like delusional fool because the audience hasn't seen this remarkable man yet
Â 
Yeah, on this episode they really didn't give us any reason to hate him, but they didn't give us any reason to love him either. That's what bothers me, but hopefully it will change for the best on the Wall
3650	The Abominable SnowOther	2014-05-13	Â This s3 scene's a trip

Â 
...
3651	clawson24	2014-05-13	Gatiss was...perfect? Can't think of a better way to act Iron Bank-er.
Â 
The whole scene was handled very well. From finally seeing Bravos in all of its glory, to Davos revealing the gold to Saan.Â 
Â 
Sooo they get Saan's pirates and buy sellswords now??


Â 
Mark Gatiss' acting was terrific, but I wish they would've made the representatives of the Iron Bank more ethnically distinguishable from most Westerosi, or at least give them accents. Think Syrio in Season 1.
3652	clawson24	2014-05-13	Stephen Dillane is the shit. It's the writing that's the problem. Oddly enough, the nuance that's missing from the writing is only mildly tolerable because of the complexity he brings to the character in his performance.


Â 
Stephen Dillane is terrific. I haven't often liked Stannis's portrayal on the show, but when reading some of Stannis's best excerpts and quotes from the book, I can quite easily imagine Dillane knocking them absolutely out of the park. Really hoping his badassness and redemption begin in earnest come Episode 9.
3653	clawson24	2014-05-13	They still had the black water music though when we first saw Stannis on ship. I actually like the music but there's no other way to interpret it other than villianish. Stannis has 4k men, with the gold he will surely double that #. His triumph at the wall is going to be less glorious then it should be. Wildings outnumber Stannis 20-1 in book.


A 100K-strong army with freaking mammoths, giants, wargs, etc., being routed by a force a fraction that size will still remain a very impressive feat on the show regardless of whether or not they slightly increase the size of Stannis's army.

That's actually a pretty funny observation. The Iron Bank isn't a temple, it's three white guys sitting in a room.

Â 
Banks don't gamble, they hedge to limit their loss not to increase their profit.Â 
Â 
Why needlessly antagonize the IT, along with 2 of the most powerful families in Westeros, now? After it has won the war? Surely the time for the IB to hedge its bets was while the war was raging full swing and the outcome was still in question?Â 
Â 
And Stannis is not what I would call a hedge, certainly not at this juncture in the storyline. He's a huge gamble, with down far greater, and more likely than the up.Â 
Â 
The IB, if indeed a proper bank, should have done its risk assessment a long time ago, at the beginning of the war, and should have continued to do so all through. Nothing Davos told them is new information. It should not sway them. And as a risk, in his present state, Stannis is not worth taking. Let's not forget, if Stannis should for any reason whatsoever happen to die, his claim dies with him. And There will be no one to repay the bank its loan.Â 
Â 
We can argue this all day, and I still say the loan does not make sense. Simply put, Stannis is not a good credit risk at this juncture, and the IB has no incentive, or purpose, of its own to induce it to gamble on him.Â 


Â 


Â 
Why not argue all day?Â  This is the internet!!Â  
Â 
Without getting to much into the weeds here, but if you don't think banks gamble you clearly have not been paying attention to the financial industry of the real world these past 10 years.Â Â Â 
Â 
The big assumption you are making is that Stannis is getting just as much money as the IT.Â Â  With the IT owing millions to the IB and there being a very real risk to the IB of the IT not paying their debts at all, I don't see giving Stannis say 10 grand (100 grand?) really being a huge gamble.Â  If Stannis fails then a small loan is simply that, a small bad loan.Â Â  However, if Stannis WINS the IT and the IB spurns him at this point, they could potentially lose all leverage / rights to their total IT debt ofÂ gold.Â  In fact the IBÂ giving StannisÂ just enough to keep him viable and in their pocket seems a perfectly legitimate business expense ESPECIALLY since their whole business model is based on the fact that fear of potentially well-funded people like Stannis lurking in the shadows to take the IT by force keeps the current holder of the IT in line.

Two episodes ago two seasoned commanders as Jorah and Selmy said 11k men were enough to take KL. Stannis already has 4k and the gold to hire many more (he asks for 20k sellswords in the books).
Stannis never had this numbers in the books when he went to the wall. Taking KL with his 1500 men was never an option. Now in the show it might be, and if they paint it that way, with the mannis avoiding the temptation, ill will almost forget D&D for their harm in the past.
I keep my fingers crossed.

Â 
Don't worry. We know Stannis wins the wildling battle even if the TV audience doesn't. He's being shaped up for a major victory. I think that's why the wildlings are being shown as such vile, heartless people. People might not like the cannibal angle for the Thenns but it gives Stannis a enemy worth smashing. That's something the Unsullied viewers can get behind. Â 
Let me ask you: do you think they'll make Stannis a sort of antagonist for Jon later on? We know Stannis does sort of bully the Night's Watch in book 5 but do you think D&D will over do it?Â

3668	Areo Speedwagon	2014-05-14	Very interesting take on the Episode and Stannis in particular from the avclub's review of episode 6.Â  The whole article is great, a link is at the bottom.Â  But the paragraph before the one posted is about how a theme of the season is the balance of power and justice, and that if you get it right you might earn someone's loyalty.Â 
Â 
The author then states how the whole episode is filled with loyalty and its opposite - Theon, Shae, Tyrion, Jaime.Â  Then he gets to....
Â 

Â 
Thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s why maybe the most important scene in this episode is its very first one. Davos and Stannis show up in Braavos to beg for the Iron Bank to back their claim to the throne. The bankers (one of whom is played by Mark Gatiss!) say no, thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not something theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re going to do, but Davos wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t hear of it. He immediately begins extolling the virtues of his king, of the man who spared his life and made him a knight but still took his fingers. Game Of Thrones rarely tips its hand as to where it believes these various claimants to the throne to be in relation to each otherâ<U+0080><U+0094>outside of its general love for all things Danyâ<U+0080><U+0094>but hereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a pretty big moment in relation to this episode. Stannis may not have much, but he has the ability to get men to make huge speeches proclaiming his greatness to rooms full of powerful men. And, ultimately, that might be even more worthwhile than gold.

Â 
Â 
The whole review is great, read it here.
3669	Red Raven	2014-05-14	Definitely going to over do it. I have faith in D&D. 
Â 
Which is a shame since in the book Stannis has a grudging respect for Jon and Mel likes him. Â Of course those nuances will be sledgehammered out of the show.
3670	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-05-14	well... I hope it doesnt but it might change. Stannis will ve now more or less 10 times the men Jon has, and plenty of coin. That might make him even more bossy 
They dont even need Jon to help him to find more men, since he has gold to hire as many as he needs.

Yes, Tycho arrives at Stannis' camp at the end of ADWD and then meets with Stannis in the Theon sample chapter in TWOW. Stannis signs his name in blood because the ink bottle has frozen (For some reason this moment was very inspiring to me: x)
Â 
BAMF.

According to Bryan Cogman this was only a provisional loan - though obviously this hasn't been made apparent on screen - so he'll probably need mo' money at a later date
3680	Miodrag	2014-05-15	Bryan Cogman answering some Stannis questions from an EW interview yesterday.
Â 
The Stannis storyline has been stuck with him fuming at his big table in Dragonstone for awhile. It must be fun to get him out and about again.
Absolutely. That was the idea. When we first broached the subject of bringing in the Iron Bank, for awhile the version was [Iron Bank representativeÂ Tycho Nestoris] would come to Dragonstone and meet on Stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099> turf. It just seemed like whenever we can open up this world and give the audience something new visually and take characters out of their comfort zone, the better. We thought it would be more dramatic and interesting to put Stannis in the position of having to go ask for a loan. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a humiliating situation. The Stannis storyline is certainly more of a slow burn, but it will pay off.
My impression of Stannis is that he would be a very just king, but would also be terrible at the job because has zero social game. How can you rule without any understanding other peopleâ<U+0080><U+0099>s needs and motivations?
Thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a valid question. Heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s learning, though. This was a teachable episode for him and another reason why he keeps Davos around even though they donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t see eye to eye and Davos commits what Stannis sees as a little treason now and then. Davos helps him face these hard truths and through Davos heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s slowly learning some lessons. Here he has to swallow his pride. It was great fun having [actors] Liam Cunningham,Stephen DillaneÂ and Mark Gatiss all on the set in the same scene. They have very different personas and different ways of working and it was great to see them bounce off each other.


Â 
These answers actually contain all the reasons TV Stannis is such a dull, flat and utterly uninteresting character. While "adapting" ASOIAF, a saga full of brilliant coming-of-age stories, the showrunners took an arc that literally has nothing to do with coming of age (Stannis) and turned it into - a terrible and cliched coming-of-age arc, all the more terrible because of the actual age of the protagonist: a fully grown, mature and responsible man.
Â 
"Here he has to swallow his pride." Cogman seems to think that's a good thing. Like, he actually thinks it's an interesting development: to make a character swallow own pride. Well, it is not, especially in an epic story like ASOIAF, and even more especially with a character like Stannis.
Â 
First, that theme - swallowing a pride - has generally been worn-out for quite some time. Whatever I can say about the theme of pride and its importance and why it's wrong to turn it into a simplified cliche a la "pride is something to be swallowed", Tarantino said it better in his Pulp Fiction, with Butch (the boxer) storyline. And Pulp Fiction happened 20 years ago. One would expect GOT showrunners saw that movie and learned something from it.
Â 
Second, in the world Martin created, swallowing a pride can be a very dangerous thing. Ned swallowed his pride at the end, and died because of it (had he refused to "confess", Joff wouldn't be able to kill him the way he did). Robb decided to swallow his pride and ask Freys for forgiveness, and he died because of it. Robert decided to swallow his pride and tolerate the family he married into and was indebted to, and he died because of it. Then, we have Jaime, whose pride is taken away from him along with his swordhand: after a brief period of giving up on life, he rebounded by establishing another kind of pride for himself, because otherwise he'd probably see no reason to live anymore. Then there's Theon, a man who literally had to swallow anything that resembles a pride, and at that point he really isn't a human being any more - only after Jeyne Pool awakens something deep inside him (something that is inevitably connected with pride), he's able to find some traces of humanity in himself. Even Littlefinger and Varys, who are thought to have no pride at all, may actually have a very vivid pride, only hidden from the world (in case of Littlefinger, it's as good as proven, while Varys' last appearance indicates the same). And of course, there's Tywin, a man whose pride was too artificial and deformed into arrogance of the most dangerous kind. All of which means that pride is not something Martin takes lightly either way. You can't take it too far because it becomes arrogance (Tywin, or Jaime with both hands), and you can't live of it, especially if it isn't based in any reality any more (Robert), but to swallow it is not a bit less wrong. Like with many other aspects, for pride Martin found the perfect balance, while providing numerous different angles that illustrate the reality the balance is rooted in. Throwing all that away for some cheap, nihilistic, "one has to swallow the pride to succeed" philosophy, is among the biggest mistakes of this "adaptation", and possible the biggest one, from which many other mistakes stem.
Â 
Third, boiling Stannis down to a man who has to swallow his pride is a very, very poor and unfortunate decision. His arc is, along with Dany's, probably the most unique one among all ASOIAF arcs. Other arcs and storylines, while no less brilliant, are comparable with (and sometimes influenced by) stories of other authors and/or actual history. Stannis (along with Dany) is not. If there's another story of a ruler who actually saw the power of gods and uses one god in his struggle to win the throne he claims but ultimately refuses to succumb his will to any god because he rests his duties solely with his subjects, I definitely didn't hear about it. Regardless of what one thinks of Stannis, his arc is a perhaps unparalleled storytelling (and a masterpiece, I'd add), that touches some of the most important issues humanity's been facing forever (our relationship with deities, and our place in the higher order of things, if there is one at all). And it would simply be impossible to achieve, if at the center of everything there's a man who has to swallow his pride. It would be ridiculous. The entire story would collapse. The man who can defy gods he uses by the way, who'll break rather than bend, and who inspires the ultimate devotion he got from Davos and Cressen, is not someone who "has to swallow his pride".
Â 
As is the case with Dany's war on slavery, Stannis' arc is so unique, its mindless and pointless to analyze an adaptation of it without comparing the adaptation with the original. And this interview by Cogman gave me all the reasons why HBO's adaptation is so inferior to the source material.

Â 
Agreed. Â  THe showrunners Â have not understood that Stannis' story is not a morality tale......(at least not yet). Â Stannis is a force of nature. A hurricane , an earthquake. Â A hurricane does not have to swallow its pride. A hurricane is.

3686	1000AcresAndAHoldfast	2014-05-15	They still had the black water music though when we first saw Stannis on ship. I actually like the music but there's no other way to interpret it other than villianish. Stannis has 4k men, with the gold he will surely double that #. His triumph at the wall is going to be less glorious then it should be. Wildings outnumber Stannis 20-1 in book.


Â 
The Blackwater music isn't evilÂ IMO, just a bit grim and menacing, andÂ that's what Stannis is all about.Â

Bryan Cogman said that the bank is still supporting the Lannister, but they also gave Stannis a loan. A smaller loan than what he wanted but a loan nonetheless. So we might still see Tycho coming to Stannis in season 5. IMO it would be even better than in show since their conversation would be a 180 of the scene in S4E6.

Â 


Third, boiling Stannis down to a man who has to swallow his pride is a very, very poor and unfortunate decision.


Â 
It would be ridiculous for a character who is continually told by multiple people, including a powerful sorceress, they are the second coming of the messiah and will be the one to ultimately defeat the Great Darkness and who for two books spoke about almost nothing save for what should be his "by right" to learn a lesson in humility?Â  Humility seems like the exact thing a person like that would need.Â  And on the Blackwater he got it.Â  He regrouped, and by book five he's a fan favorite.
Â 
And I think it's a little reductionist to say that, based on that interview, Stannis can be boiled down only to a man who has to swallow his pride.Â  There's more to Stannis than that.Â  In the show as well as the books.Â  Sure Cogman said it, but in no way did he say that's all Stannis is.
Â 


Agreed. Â  THe showrunners Â have not understood that Stannis' story is not a morality tale......(at least not yet). Â Stannis is a force of nature. A hurricane , an earthquake. Â A hurricane does not have to swallow its pride. A hurricane is.


Â 
I also don't really understand this.Â  What do you mean by a force of nature?Â  A force of nature that, as a child, was convinced to abandon a pet he had nursed back to health?Â  A force of nature that got crushed on the Blackwater?Â  A force of nature that regrets killing his brother?Â 
Â 
I feel that this and the above sentiment mirror the whole "Stannis will break before he bends" statement.Â  It sounds cool, and we've heard it enough throughout the books, but isn't necessarily true based on what we've seen Stannis do.Â  He bends to Davos suggesting going to the Wall, he bends to Jon advising him against marching on the dreadfort and gather the mountain clans.Â  To me, that quote came about from people who either don't know him (as the story is told via POVs), or from before he got a dose of humility on the Blackwater...

Â 
Oh, so the show is now in "Lecturing Stannis" business? They aren't adapting his story, but they're making him a better person, which is why they're serving him some humility he needs? If they are, they're doing a very poor job, by the way, which isn't surprising: when 21st century people know as little about banks and bankers as D&D evidently do (judging by the Iron Bank scene in the last episode), they're hardly fit to teach anyone about anything.
Â 
As for reductionism, just read what you wrote about Stannis: "A character who for two books spoke about almost nothing save for what should be his by right". You'll find a reduction at its finest there.

3693	WinterisAlwaysComing	2014-05-17	Â 
I think you're supposed to deduce, even though they kind of spell it out for you, that the IB doesn't believe the Iron Throne is paying them back, probably because they haven't yet and Tywin is near the end of his life. So like typical IB mentality they'll aid a man to take over who will pay them back. That's the point, they're convinced Stannis will pay them if they help him. Not so different from the books except that the Lannisters haven't outright refused them yet which is honestly sort of evident anyways since they've been indebted for so long already.
Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 
Honestly Stannis had zero good ideas at this point of the books anyways.Â 


Â 
1) I actually thought it was pretty clear and smart how the writers showed that Davos correctly reasoned out that the Lannisters were only "talking about" paying their debts to the Iron Bank. Â "He doesn't just TALK about paying his debts...he actually does it."
Â 
2) I'm in the 2% of viewers who like show Stannis. Â Steven Dillane is amazing. Â And so is the character. Â  I was angry with both book Robb and show Robb for not following his father's wishes and swearing fealty to Stannis. Â Things would have turned out so differently.

Well, Stannis hadn't declared by then. But even then, wouldn't Robb face the same issue of Renly regarding the succession? It seems that Robb's first choice would have been to crown Tommen - he says as much - but that's rather uninspiring and impractical.

Â They also freaked out after Tyrion's monologue and were bummed that they left 8 minutes on the board.

I asked who they thought was going to fight, and they thought Jamie would be involved, but didn't know what side he'd fight on since he's Kingsguard and all. Â Bronn was also brought up as Tyrion's savior.

Â It's almost frustrating to watch this with her at some points but I do it anyway. Â So the fact that she remembered Jaqen's name AND the fact that he was from Braavos was just really funny to me, considering she also thought the LannistersÂ wanted money from the Iron Bank-- not that they already have borrowed it-- so that's how oblivious she is normally.
Â 
She loves Oberyn. Â Pefect! Â 
Â 
She thinks the trial will be next week and it will either be Jaime or "That guy from the Vale" aka Bronn.
Â 
She was surprised to see Shae brought back but it didn't mindfuck her the way it did me when reading it so that's unfortunate.

She also likes Yara and thinks she's cool.
Â 
She literally doesn't give a shit about Stannis and I'm sad.

She seems like she expects Tyrion to win his trial and have life go on as normal. Â When I brought up that even if he's declared innocent, Tywin could disinherit him, or Cersei could kill him, or he could be banished, she was like "Oh...".
Â 
She actually liked Dany this week and was surprised by the fact that she did. Â She's sick of Dany being in Essos so when Dany announced she was staying, my friend was like "fuck this i dun currrr" but she liked it this week and liked that it was Dany actually having some troubles and not knowing what to do and getting shown what was what.

Hue. Mum now thinks Tywin could have coerced Shae but cant think of why when he originally planned for Tyrion to take the black. That and she thought Shae was really on that boat. Oh man, episode 8 is gonna blow her dome.
Â 
Mum also thinks Jaime will be Tyrion's champion. I told her to pay attention to that other guy leaning forward during Tyrion's declaration.

When asked why would Jaime fight for Cersei since she has been so nasty to him and their dynamic has been so altered over this issue, he replied that Jaime has said repeatedly how much he loves her, and although they are not "together" at the moment, years of being so tightly bonded will sway his loyalty to her over Tyrion.
Also he thought that the boy was eaten by the dragon (even though we saw the goat taken).
3719	Florina Laufeyson	2014-05-11	Weird cuz my mum thinks that Cersei and Jaime are basically splitsville. Shes paid attention enough to realize that Jaime loves his bby brother and will do anything to protect him. Â This is why she thinks he will be Tyrion's champion.Â

Â 
I'm not surprised that most people aren't considering The Mountain. Â He's been name dropped a fair amount, but we haven't seen him since season 2. Â Once it's revealed, there will be a collective, "Ahhh, that makes sense..." followed by.. "Oberyn vs the Mountain? Â HOLY SHIT IT'S GOIN DOWN"
3727	Lady Lurksalot	2014-05-12	My Unsullied roommates caught on to the "surprise witness"  everyone waits to see turning out to be Shae, but think Bronn is going to champion Tyrion again. They can't guess who the Crown's champion will be, though, but didn't think it will be Jaime, due to the lack of his hand. I think they're gonna be blown away once they find out.
3728	HouseHarrison	2014-05-12	All my unsullied friends care about is "Khaleesi" and "when is she coming to Westeros". It's a shame, though by the end the Trial had peaked their interest I think.

Â 
Repeat the soundbite where she says she will stay in Meereen over and over until they realign their priorities. Â
3730	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-12	I'm surprised, honestly, at so many people thinking Jaime will be either side's champion. Â I mean, I get it on the surface-- but think about it. Â He hasÂ one fucking hand and is shown to not be such a good fighter. Â Neither side is dumb enough to risk the outcome on Jaime.Yes, but he has been taking lessons. In another show/book/Disney adaptation, that would be enough for him to activate the superpower of love and beat the Crown's champion
3731	The Kinkslayer	2014-05-12	"So this Oberyn guy is Littlefinger's or just lives in his brothel?"
3732	Bungholes First	2014-05-12	They said the Titan of Braavos was badass.
Â 
They thought it was nice seeing "Mycroft" being Tycho Nestorious.
Â 
They thought that Ramsay was going to rape Theon, drown him, or that his penis was stuffed in the washcloth. We also remarked how that bath could be painful with all those sores.
Â 
They're calling Hizdahr zo Loraq "Lenny Kravitz,"
Â 
They thought it was BS that Dontos and the necklace were found.
Â 
They think that the Small Council will send in the Mountain to hunt down the Hound.
Â 
They predicted Shae being the surprise witness moments before she stepped in.
Â 
They think Shae is going to try to break Tyrion out in upcoming episodes and that Tywin or Cersei would make good on previous threats and kill her. (As I predicted as a change.)
Â 
They all thought it was sweet that Jaime was willing to sacrifice for Tyrion and rooted on Tyrion when he had his outburst.
Â 
We then had a debate on who would fight in the trial by combat. Some at first thought that Jaime would fight for Tyrion and die, thus completing his arc of redemption. Another thought that Cersei would pick Jaime to force him into choosing his own life or Tyrion's, since she now hates Jaime too for raping her next to her dead son. Or that Cersei would make Jaime and Bronn fight to the death as one final act of vengeance against Tyrion. They're all afraid for these characters.
Â 


I'm surprised, honestly, at so many people thinking Jaime will be either side's champion. Â I mean, I get it on the surface-- but think about it. Â He hasÂ one fucking hand and is shown to not be such a good fighter. Â Neither side is dumb enough to risk the outcome on Jaime.


Â 
The belief among my friends is that Jaime as the Hand of the King's Son, Queen's Brother, and King's Uncle would be untouchable and that whoever goes up against him would throw the fight.

3733	Cyril	2014-05-12	The Unsullied I watch with had a clever little moment of thinking that Loras will be Cersei's champion.Â  Obviously Loras was hyped at as a jouster, but I don't think his weaknesses in real fights were ever addressed in the TV series, so there's no reason to think he'd do terribly.
Â 
I liked the idea.Â  If he wins, Tyrion dies.Â  If he loses, then there's a problem out of Cersei's back, since it will be hard to find another husband for her.
3734	ohpooratlas	2014-05-12	My unsullied boyfriend hasn't seen any of the trailers, so he hasn't seen the shots of Oberyn and the Mountain fighting.
Â 
Consequently that means he thinks Jaime is going to volunteer for Tyrion. I was like "What? Really? He has only one hand!" And he said "Yeah, but he's training with the other hand."
Â 
Silly sweet summer child.
Â 
He's also absolutely one hundred percent certain that Tyrion is going to survive. Or rather ... win his trial. Or ... just somehow manage to evade death. I can't wait for the end of episode 8 ... and then to have him proven right by episode 10.
Â 
I think we can all bank on the Oberyn/Tyrion scene from the books because we still haven't had the "if you're looking for justice, you've come to the wrong place" line in the show yet, and I can't imagine that line happening under any other context.
3735	abigail	2014-05-12	one of my biggest fears was that Shae's betrayal on TV wouldn't be as shocking, confusing, and sad as in the books, and lo and behold, it wasn't for my non-reader friend. He was confused about why I would ask him if it was shocking at all since it was 'obviously because Tyrion broke her heart' (in e3 or 4)
Â 
He found it more shocking that Tyrion would ask for a trial by combat (and also he predicted that Jaime would refuse to fight for Tyrion because Tyrion lashed out and fucked up Jaime's plan to save him)
Â 
My other friend had some interesting predictions... that Dany would slowly grow tired/bored and powerless, and 1 or 2 of her dragons would be killed, leaving her to slowly spiral back to where she started lol. Another prediction was that Bronn would fight Jaime for Tyrion, lose, and Tyrion would die because "I ignored all the warning signs for Ned Stark and don't want to be oblivious to those pointing to Tyrion's demise"
3736	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-12	Somehow my friends already quite easily predicted the oberyn vs The Mountain matchup. It certainly helped that Twyin told Oberyn he would deliver Gregor to him earlier in the season. In hindsight I wish they hadn't included that scene, as it made the matchup more obvious to unsullied. They also are entertaining the thought that The Hound could come into play and fight The Mountain.Â
3737	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-12	I'm surprised, honestly, at so many people thinking Jaime will be either side's champion. Â I mean, I get it on the surface-- but think about it. Â He hasÂ one fucking hand and is shown to not be such a good fighter. Â Neither side is dumb enough to risk the outcome on Jaime.


Yea seriously its like everyone forgot he lost his right hand. Honestly my friends didn't even really entertain Jaime as an option for very long for that reason.Â
3738	ovis alba	2014-05-12	Yea seriously its like everyone forgot he lost his right hand. Honestly my friends didn't even really entertain Jaime as an option for very long for that reason.Â 


Â 
I don't find it so unreasonable. Most of my friends are asking themselves who would even dare to fight for Tyrion as you sort of challenge the crown. So even if you win, it's not like you would be very appreciated afterwards. So for those who think it could be Jaime, it's not a question of him being a good fighter, but him being the only one that dares to do it making it even more tragic that he has only one hand and that he as a kingsguard would chose his brother over "the king" that tyrion might have killed on his watch.
Although due to the reasoning many actually do more suspect Oberyn as he has been portrayed as someone who is not afraid to stand up against the Lannisters. However hardly anyone makes the connection to the Mountain, him not being on screen at all, they just don't consider him, but mainly people that are already in King's Landing. Loras is actually among the picks as it would be a win-win situation for Cersei.
3739	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-12	Wifey figures Jaime will fight for the crown, die on purpose.

Ah, bottle that one up for Cersei's trial in aWoW, possibly.
3740	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-12	Also in the show, Jaime has been improving with his left hand and dealt pretty well with Bronn using it. Almost certainly deliberate by the show writers to make people believe he is a viable option to fight for Tyrion OR Cersei
3741	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-12	I'm surprised, honestly, at so many people thinking Jaime will be either side's champion. Â I mean, I get it on the surface-- but think about it. Â He hasÂ one fucking hand and is shown to not be such a good fighter. Â Neither side is dumb enough to risk the outcome on Jaime.

He's been pretty good with his one hand. Granted they super-cut down his ability with 2 though
3742	Red Tiger	2014-05-12	Yea seriously its like everyone forgot he lost his right hand. Honestly my friends didn't even really entertain Jaime as an option for very long for that reason.Â 


A friend of mine said that Oberyn would eventually go wild on King's Landing and Jaime would be the only one capable of stopping him.
Â 
I was speechless....

HAhah thats exactly what my unsullied friend thinks.
3744	glaxxon	2014-05-12	My brother thinks Jaime or Bronn will fight for Tyrion.
Â 
He guessed Shae was going to be the last witness and would testify against Tyrion.
3745	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-05-12	Hubby was all "Tyrion is gonna die. These are his last episodes. He's gonna die." I had to remind him about the whole champion thing. He was very impressed by Braavos and I think he may even be starting to like Stannis a little bit. He is much more likeable when he's not around Melisandre. Â I think he was confused by Shae's betrayal.
Â 
Also, Alfie Allen killed it too b/c hubby also commented about how he not Theon anymore and "What did that guy do to him?" I think he feels bad for Theon.

3747	King Zee	2014-05-12	thinking that Jamie Â will be i championing either the Crown Â (as KG Commander) or Tyrion isnt a bad Â spec for the unsullied. It makes good dramatic sense Â especially if you think that Jamie Â dies this season in a final act of redemption.
3748	weirwood woman	2014-05-12	Husbands reactions...
Titan of Braavos - "OMG look at thats F***n awesome!"
Stannis in Braavos (or anywhere) - "That guys an idiot don't you think?" (um ...NO)
Davos at the baths scene - "oooh Titties" (eyes glaze over and does not hear the dialogue)
Dany (anywhere) - " mmmmKhaleeeeesi" (drooling inappropriately)
Tyrions Trial - "Oh the poor little buggar. He's F***ed"

Â 
Hehe yeah it makes no logical sense, but storywise it would be fantastic don't you think? The combat could be dull and one sided but I understand why people think it will go this way. There are several interesting possibilities for non-readers. Bronn vs Jaime especially after their training. Oberyn vs Jamie. Bronn vs the Mountain. Jamie vs the Mountain. Oberyn vs the Mountain. All duels have some foreshadowing throughout this season. If I wouldn't read the books I would myself somehow expect Jamie to at least want to fight for Tyrion. Yeah I agree that neither side would be dumb enough for wanting Jamie to fight, but the way this was setup in the TV series, Tyrion could have no other choice. What if Oberyn wouldn't even offer to fight and Bronn would refuse because he was promised lordship. Then even left handed Jaime would probably be better than Tyrion himself. But sadly it will go on as in the books. And to me that is probably the only issue I have with GRRM character wise, that he decided to kill off Oberyn so damn fast.Â
3750	Rhaegar I Targaryen	2014-05-12	When Tyrion demanded trial by combat, my unsullied brother correctly deduced who the Crowns champion and Tyrion's champion would be. I was incredibly proud of him and myself for supplying him with the tools necessary to come to this conclusion.Â
3751	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-12	talked to 2 briefly...both assuming that Jaime will definitely be Tyrion's champion...when i mentioned that he is Kingsguard, both dismissed it saying he's already willing to give up his position to defend Tyrion...this is his best chance to...
Â 
both cussing out shae so badÂ
3752	gotgrrrl	2014-05-12	Husband is afraid that Tyrion will be executed and if he's gone, he says he'll stop watching (yea, right.Â  Like he really has a choice!).Â  However, since Tyrion won his last trial by combat, he thinks he'll be okay but by now unsullied realize that no one is safe.Â 
Â 
He also didn't remember Braavos when it appeared in the opening.Â  I had to do a little reminder about the Iron Bank and also that it's where Faceless Men come from, not to mention Syrio.Â  Okay, I'm a little obsessed with Braavos.
Â 
Thought the whole Ramsay/Yara scene was stupid.Â  He said that men with big swords could easily kill a bunch of dogs, especially since they were in separate cages and wouldn't be released at once.Â
3753	Rhaquentis	2014-05-12	My mother likes Yara/Asha now, and she thinks Tyrion will definitely get away with it and that Jaime will help him. yay mom
3754	Seneti	2014-05-12	Â

Â 
This. At this point, there are only three people in KL who have not openly abandoned Tyrion: Jaime, Bronn and Oberyn. Of those three, Jaime is the most obvious choice (because he already showed that he would do almost anything to save his little brother), followed by Bronn (because he already championed him once). Oberyn is really more of an obscure choice from that standpoint.

Â 
Oberyn is the obvious choice if you spoil it for them though
3756	Velociraptor	2014-05-12	She also said she didn't care about Theon until he became Reek, and that his performance was perfect this week and it was in its own league along with Peter's. Â I was really happy she's starting to appreciate him.
Â 
She also likes Yara and thinks she's cool.
Â 
She literally doesn't give a shit about Stannis and I'm sad.
Â 
She seems like she expects Tyrion to win his trial and have life go on as normal. Â When I brought up that even if he's declared innocent, Tywin could disinherit him, or Cersei could kill him, or he could be banished, she was like "Oh...".
Â 
She actually liked Dany this week and was surprised by the fact that she did. Â She's sick of Dany being in Essos so when Dany announced she was staying, my friend was like "fuck this i dun currrr" but she liked it this week and liked that it was Dany actually having some troubles and not knowing what to do and getting shown what was what.


Â 
I know that feeling very well. I too watch this with a girlfriend of mine and she is utterly bored with Stannis (dubbing him as the most uninteresting man on Earth). Which is painful for me, being a staunch supporter of Stannis since he first appeared in Season 2. However, sad as I am to admit it, she has a point. My love for Stannis stems from the second season and the books, but the showrunners really don't give him any love in Seasons 3 and 4. They portray him as a religious fanatic (burning people for heresy, really, I can't argue with her on that, being an atheist myself) and in the latest season he basically sits moping over his bad fortunes, expecting others (mostly Davos) to do stuff for him. I can see why he would become a boring character for my girlfriend and other casual viewers, who haven't read the books. I just really hope they redeem him in later episodes and prove her wrong.

3757	Daenerys Must Die	2014-05-12	Seems like a lot of non-readers are already picking up on the seeds they've planted for Gregor/Oberyn.. of course showing footage of them fighting in the season preview does spoil that a bit.. as well as showing the mountain in the next episode shot. I just hope the "Oberyn stepping up when no one else will" moment is as badass as it needs to be.
Â 
My mother thinks it will be Meryn Trant vs. The Hound.. I suggested to her what about Oberyn to which she replied "who?" ...
3758	Fuse Prime	2014-05-12	Just about everyone I know, think Stannis is a unlikable, and boring. Â I'd like to see opinions of him after The Battle at the Wall. Â
3759	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-12	i'm throwing my unsullied friends off by suggesting Loras vs. Jaime...
Â 
"Margery could convince Loras to fight on behalf of Jofferey to impress Tommen more and continue playing her part of "mourning widow"
Â 
jaime already so willing to give up kingsguard for Tyrion would probably jump at chance to defend Tyrion and kill Loras before his marriage to Cersei"

they bought itÂ  Â
3760	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-12	Â 
I don't find it so unreasonable. Most of my friends are asking themselves who would even dare to fight for Tyrion as you sort of challenge the crown.

Good point on Jaime. Maybe a lot of unsullied aren't considering The Mountain but I'm telling you all 3 of my friends are pretty set on him being a champion for Tywin/Cersei. It makes a lot of sense since he is Twyin's man when the possibility is considered.Â
3761	greywindsrage	2014-05-12	My friends think that Jaime's gonna champion Tyrion.
3762	Rhaegar I Targaryen	2014-05-12	My friends think that Jaime's gonna champion Tyrion.


Â 
He could. D&D love to change things up a bit Â
3763	lyanna_maria	2014-05-12	So my flatmate made a lot of comments about the episode, which is not like her:
- She kind of hates Stannis, she thinks he's very unpleasant, and she finds normal that Davos is always so bitter, having to serve such an unlikeable kingÂ  
Â 
- She absolutely loved everything about Braavos 
Â 
- I'm happy with her opinions on Dany: she's realised ruling is not going to be as easy as giving cool speeches and slaughter slavers, and she doesn't like this darker, hot-headed side of her: she wishes she could be more pensive and prudent.
Â 
- She now adores Jaime because she thinks his sacrifice is "the sweetest thing we've ever seen in this show". Of course, she pities Tyrion. She wondered if Shae is doing it only out of spite, or if there's been bribes/threats.Â 
Â 
- She predicted Jaime would fight for the Crown against Tyrion and everything would be so fucked up and tragic. Then I explained that Tyrion was likely to choose a champion too, since he's not a warrior, and she doesn't know what will happen anymore.Â 
Â 
- I was sad that she didn't remember Tysha at all, or that Tywin had asked Shae to be brought to his chamber.
3764	Jacob Feybrad	2014-05-12	My Father agreed with the People thinking, Bronn will have to fight Jaime in the Trial fro Combat, but since he (impressively) predicted that it was Littlefinger and Olenna who poisoned Joffrey, he demanded to be spoiled. He was quick to realize Oberyn would be fighting, when I told him, the Mountain was involved, though.
Â 
Sadly, he still thinks of Stannis as a total Loser and Whimp who can't do Shit on his own, either relying on Melisandre or Davos. I really hope they do at least something to give him a Sense of Leadership and Independence back. He also perceived him as humourless and bleak, which is also sad, but true for the Show Character as he presents himself to more casual Watchers.
Â 
Luckily, he agrees with me, that Daenerys is slowly slipping. Her Actions in the last few Episodes were met with disregard for her Intentions and we all agreed, that Hizdahr practically owned her this Episode. He was almost gleeful while saying "that's what she gets when she wants to rule". It gave me Hope.
Â 
And, of course, everyone enjoys Oberyn not giving a single fuck about anything.
3765	Envie	2014-05-12	Seems like a lot of non-readers are already picking up on the seeds they've planted for Gregor/Oberyn.. of course showing footage of them fighting in the season preview does spoil that a bit.. as well as showing the mountain in the next episode shot. I just hope the "Oberyn stepping up when no one else will" moment is as badass as it needs to be.
Â 
My mother thinks it will be Meryn Trant vs. The Hound.. I suggested to her what about Oberyn to which she replied "who?" ...


Â 
Yes, this spoiler in the previews sucked because I think enough show only fans saw that and have put two and two together to make the reaction less significant. They SAW Oberyn fighting in his armor and fancy moves - they know he's going to be the champion but they don't know why or for which side yet so I guess that's ok. No one seems to be remembering the Mountain even though there have been reminders. I think they screwed the pooch on that one by leaving him out too often in previous episodes / seasons and also changing actors. Now show-only viewers are confused and don't remember Gregor Clegane much. Oberyn's story of Elia's murder being retold in the "previously on GoT" opener will help I suppose.Â
3766	lyanna_maria	2014-05-12	One of my friends asked if the trial was gonna be Tywin vs. TyrionÂ  Â  Â   I had to explain the championing thing to her, and then her guess was Jaime vs. Bronn. But after a bit of elaboration on the circumstances by me, her prediction was "Jaime is gonna defend Tyrion even though he's not a great warrior anymore, because he's only the only one who cares about him".
Â 
She also has a feeling that Oberyn's revenge is coming soon, and she has a feeling that the trial will have something to do with it: but she doesn't even want to think about Oberyn getting himself into any combats, because she loves him and doesn't want anything bad to happen to himÂ  Â

3767	We Swore A Vow	2014-05-12	They think bronn will fight for tyrion against the mountain. They think shae is a triflin bitch and lloved the tyrion speech. They are amped up after Davos speech with the bank but I don't think they know where Stannis is going after he gets His money. 
No hound scenes was also a big bummer for them. I've shown them a bunch of videos of Bjornson the actor for the mountain and I've explained to them how plate works and that the mountains strength allows him to wear the highest amount of protection and that the dude wields a two hander in one hand. I've made sure that they understand oberyns anger and who Elia was and what happened to her children. But they have not mentioned if they think oberyn will be involved.
3768	Knight of Ashes	2014-05-12	She still thinks Dany's name is Khaleesi.
I give up.
3769	snowy	2014-05-12	After theorizing for at least a half an hour, my husband concluded that Oberyn and the Mountain would pair up for combat. The trial was the only part on his mind. He was so worked up over it that he all but forgot everything else. *chuckles*
3770	NymTargaryen	2014-05-12	My friend thinks that Tyrion will fight himself and he's going to die.
3771	Nutbean	2014-05-12	When Tyrion asked for a trial by combat, my daughter thought that he was sacrificing himself so that Jaime wouldn't have to do what Tywin wants him to.
Â 
When she watched next week's promo, she thought that the Mountain was going to be going after the Hound.Â
3772	The Dame That Groans	2014-05-12	Agreed - Most unsulliedÂ feel like it will be Bronn (Tyrion) vs. Jamie (Joff) which I think D&D wanted to set up with pairing them this season (outside of just Ilyn Payne's actor's health). My pop's asked - who gets to pick first (cersei/tywin or Tyrion), once I said the crown he thought Cersei would pick Jaime and Tyrion would be torn not wanting to go against his brother and accept defeat or go to the wall if the options still available.
Â 
Yes, watching with my friend, her thoughts -
Â 
"ThatÂ statue is cool, Oh thats Bravoos, isn't that where Jaqen is from." (No, he is from Lorathi but yeah sorry your right).
Â 
"Shit more Stannis, I hate him" ("WHAT STOP WHY") "He killed his brother, not redeemable, well only if he helps Jon somehow (swoon)" (shutup, I am way better looking them him)
Â 
"Is Theon gonna kill his sister?", "Wow Theon is totally broken, he is like his little creature" (agreed)
Â 
"Yes brown people!!!!, Yes Dragon's!!!!!!!!!!!!!, oh shit they're being mean stop it" (disclamier - she is indian not racist ha)
Â 
"Oh that Hizdar guy is gonna be important later", "is he gonna try to kill Dany, like poison her or something" (Maybe), "Ok, that means yes, damnit why do minoritys hate Dany" (except for the million that call her Mysha)
Â 
"That's why I love Tyrion, he is so sarcastic" , "Shit, I fell asleep for acouple minutes", "Bringing in all these people to talk about Tyrion reminds me of the season finale of Seinfeld"
Â

Yes, this spoiler in the previews sucked because I think enough show only fans saw that and have put two and two together to make the reaction less significant. They SAW Oberyn fighting in his armor and fancy moves - they know he's going to be the champion but they don't know why or for which side yet so I guess that's ok. No one seems to be remembering the Mountain even though there have been reminders. I think they screwed the pooch on that one by leaving him out too often in previous episodes / seasons and also changing actors. Now show-only viewers are confused and don't remember Gregor Clegane much. Oberyn's story of Elia's murder being retold in the "previously on GoT" opener will help I suppose.Â 


Â 
That's the sometimes annoying but sometimes also good thing over here, we hardly get any of the trailers and also nothing of the "previously on" (which can be confusing for some) and I really try to not spoil anything to anyone.
I guess that's why here also no one I know has the Mountain on the list as he was just not present at all for quite a while and last time he was in King's Landing he basically stormed off and I'm not even sure people know he is still "working" for Tywin.
Since today Bronn also basically vanished from many guesses, because many people figure he betrayed Tyrion as he told him he took Shae to the ship but she obviously wasn't.

Bravos is soo close to meereen, why doesn't Stannis team up with Dany?
Made me think...in the books, I cant remember Stannis' reaction to Dany being alive and with dragons...if he as honorable as he says he is, shouldn't he bend the knee to her?

Â 
IMO, as far as Stannis is concerned, Dany "the Unburnt" and Aegon "the Unbashed" have no claim to the IT. The Targ Dynasty has ended, The Usurper won and thus gave the line of succession to the Stags.
Â 
Thats just IMO how he thinks though.

Exactly: according to his way of thinking, Stannis considers that his brother Robert rightfully won the throne, and he was rightfully King of the Seven Kingdoms by right of conquest.Â
3777	WhiteSnow	2014-05-12	first my friend said that Jaime will fight for Tyrion. When I asked how he is gonna do that with just one hand he said in this case Jaime will help Tyrion escape and that there will be no fight at all. I was actually quite impressed by this prediction!Â
3778	~DarkHorse~	2014-05-12	Agreed - Most unsulliedÂ feel like it will be Bronn (Tyrion) vs. Jamie (Joff) which I think D&D wanted to set up with pairing them this season (outside of just Ilyn Payne's actor's health). My pop's asked - who gets to pick first (cersei/tywin or Tyrion), once I said the crown he thought Cersei would pick Jaime and Tyrion would be torn not wanting to go against his brother and accept defeat or go to the wall if the options still available.
Â 
Yes, watching with my friend, her thoughts -

  funny commentary!


Â 
Ha thanks
3780	Father of Dragons	2014-05-12	I've only interrogated my dad about it, and he had a few things to say:
-He thinks Stannis is just misunderstood, and that Davos is his path to being understood.
-He has a feeling that Braavos will be seen again, though he doesn't know by whom or when
-He enjoyed the Salladhor scene and is pleased to see him again
-He agreed that the Dreadfort scene was pretty much pointless, but he thinks it's a character development for both Yara and Reek
-He seemed very unsettled when Reek was given a bath
-He thought the CGI was fantastic on Drogon
-He mentioned that Daenerys is finally learning how to be a Queen
-Hizdahr - "It'll be interesting to see what happens with him"
-He'd completely forgotten that Jorah was once spying for Varys, and realised that Varys must have some contact with Illyrio (must've forgotten about the skulls scene in season one) for him to have contact with Jorah
-He thinks that Oberyn is too much of a "Puss in Boots"/Antonio Banderas kind of guy
-Despite all the Hound said last week, he'd forgotten about Ser Meryn (fucking) Trant
-He had no idea about Shae being the final witness, and he often remains quiet when watching anyway
-When I asked him about the Trial by Combat, he mentioned a few names (Jaime, Bronn, Antonio) as possible champions - the latter two for Tyrion
As a side detail, I asked him if he wanted to do a Tyrion-Tywin death staring competition, and his reply was that he needed to .. do his business. I found this ironic as he has absolutely no idea what is to come between the pair.
3781	zombree	2014-05-12	I've made it pretty clear to my boyfriend and everyone who will listen that I love Oberyn Martell. So when the episode ended my boyfriend said he hopes "your guy" will fight for Tyrion. One of my friends was confusing the mountain with the hound for some reason he thought they were the same character >.<
3782	Summerfell	2014-05-12	My dad thought Asha/Yara should have killed Theon after she realized he was messed up. I actually agree that would have made sense for her character and the scene if this was a plot line that actually had happened in the books.
Â 
edit: clarity

3783	Dragon Queen	2014-05-12	My Unsullied brother texted me this, "Oh dammit. I fucking know how this will end. Tywinn will pick Jamie and Tyrion will pick Bron. Bron will kill Jamie."
Then he quickly followed with, "Don't say anything. Let me just suffer for a week."Â  Â 
He didn't blame Shae for turning against Tyrion, saying she was hurt and probably scared/coerced by the Lannisters.
My Unsulled husband is worried for Tyrion's fate, his favorite character. He thought Tyrion would pick Jaime or Bronn as his champion, but then was confused who Cersei and Tywin would pick. When I pointed out that Jaime lost his hand and isn't a good fighter ("But this is fantasy? He's been training hasn't he?"), he then guessed Oberyn would fight for Tyrion ("He's there to fuck shit up, right? Whatever Tywin wants, he's against.")
He is 100% confident that Oberyn will win the fight ("If they kill the Dorne guy, they keep emphasizing he's a prince, then Dorne will attack for sure right? Even if the Dorne guy starts to lose, I'm sure they'd step in before anything could happen to him") and is relieved since he didn't want Tyrion to go to the Wall. He thinks Jaime will get out of going to Casterly Rock, since he doesn't think the show should lose Jaime as a character yet.
I'm going to thoroughly enjoy both of their reactions when everything goes down. I told both of them before the trial happened that there was no way to predict what exactly happens and how it all goes down with Tyrion.
3784	StrollofShame	2014-05-12	Here's what I heard: "So why did Varys say he recalled what he told Tyrion about saving the city? It made him sound like he's actually on Tyrion's side...oh, I bet he is! I bet when Jamie fights whoever Tywin picks for Joff's side, while that is going on, Varys will plan to have a ship take Tyrion to the Wall..."

3785	Schokolade!	2014-05-12	My unsullied sister thinks that Stannis is like " a republican, trying to rule by fear" and that everything he said about Tommen not being a good king because he's manipulated by his grand-father and mother is just so he can create doubt and fear for the future so the iron bank will lend him money... And that Tommen is being manipulated now only because he's a teenager but once he'll turn 20 he'll be a great king and no one is gonna manipulate him... 
Also she's confused about Dany, at first she taught she was gonna take the iron throne and was rooting for her now she thinks that maybe she'll stay in slaver's bay forever besides Tommen is gonna be a great king one day so there's no need for Dany...
She thinks there won't be any fight that Tyrion will just escape with the help of Jamie.
She was confused that there weren't any Starks this episode lol! " but the Starks are the main characters,  they can't just not be in an episode, are you sure we didn't miss a scene?"
Oh and she taught the Theon/reek scene was the most heartbreaking scene of this season.

By the way this is a bit of a random question but do you happen to do video reviews or post Game of Thrones videos on you tube? There is some dude who happens to do videoÂ reviews with his indian friendÂ and I was just wondering if it was you?
3787	Neumond	2014-05-13	Unsullied: What is this trial by combat? Is it a fight till death?
Me: Yes it is. You remember the trial in the vale? Tyrion got rescued by Bron. He killed the champion of Lysa in a trial by combat.
Unsullied: So he doesnÂ´t have to fight himself?
Me: No, he can name a champion.
Unsullied: Oh his brother will be one. He will fight for Cersei!
Me: Tyrion could name his brother, too.
Unsullied: Great you just spoiled the ending of this! Jamie will die in trial by combat for Tyrion.

3788	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-13	I read into it that they were BF and GF (or GF and GF) or FWB and the Indian friend threatened to withhold sex if the poster didn't talk about the champions
3789	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-13	That's one good thing about Jaime's arc this season is that we get interesting hypothetical questions like what would happen if one of them picked Jaime? If he were allowed to fight and represented Tyrion, Tywin would face a huge dilemma. If he represented Cersei he could sacrifice himself to save Tyrion. If both named him (though with him maimed only Tyrion would because he'd understand that it might force Tywin/Cersei to rig the combat for Jaime), what would happen? And I hope they explicitly  address this next episode
3790	Seneti	2014-05-13	She also has a feeling that Oberyn's revenge is coming soon, and she has a feeling that the trial will have something to do with it: but she doesn't even want to think about Oberyn getting himself into any combats, because she loves him and doesn't want anything bad to happen to him Â  Â  


Â 
Well, someone's in for another heart-break...
Â 


Â 
IMO, as far as Stannis is concerned, Dany "the Unburnt" and Aegon "the Unbashed" have no claim to the IT. The Targ Dynasty has ended, The Usurper won and thus gave the line of succession to the Stags.
Â 
Thats just IMO how he thinks though.


Â 
I agree on Dany, but only because she's a girl and thus not heir to anything (at least by Westerosi laws). Now, if a legitimate, male Targaryen heir were to show up (not convinced on Aegon)... that might seriously shake up Stannis, IMO.

Â 
It's not like Stannis was a Targaryen supporter during the rebellion.Â  Why would he now suddenly be shaken up by the discovery of a male Targaryen heir when he was part of the war against them? That makes absolutely no sense.
3794	Gus Petch	2014-05-13	Non-Reader Friends predicted that Bronn will fight for Tyrion and Tywin is offering gold to Jorah to murder Daenerys. Â Barristan intercepts the letter and rats out Jorah as an informant of the throne. Â 
Â 
Reader Friends attributed the general positive ratings of the episode because it did not have Jon Snow in it. Â I can buy into that after last week's episode and the changes they had on it. Â Predictions? Â They know, so no predictions.

Considering they were basing this off of that unremarkable conversation between Barristan and Jorah last year. Â  It surprises me that people can conclude from something so unremarkable as that small bit of friction between the two men. Â You would think it's just a pissing contest between two tough guys but the constant differences of opinions between two ever since has gotten people thinking.

Â 
Getting off topic here, but to give a short answer: I think Stannis of all people would understand that just because some apples are rotten (Aerys and Viserys) does not mean that all the others (Aegon) are as well. But we won't know for sure until book Stannis hears of Aegon.
3798	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-13	Stannis said picking between Robert and Aerys was the hardest decision of his life. BUT he picked Robert and IMO would now see himself as more legitimate than Aegon even if real. Could go either way though
3799	Envie	2014-05-13	An unsullied friend of mine begged and pleaded for two days now to be spoiled as to whether or not Tyrion dies so I finally relented and said no, but now that seems to have just made it worse because then they wanted to know more details and I followed it up with "No details, read the book - but Tyrion's life is fucked after this ..." hahhaaa. I'm so mean. So now they're certain he goes to the wall and becomes buddies with Jon. Hey they DID beg for the answer but sometimes the answer is worse than not knowing if it only leads to more questions!
3800	~DarkHorse~	2014-05-13	My unsullied friend thinks Oberyn is an interesting character, who should get more screen time and information on his background. He wants to know more about his family and culture.

Hahaha! Sounds like my hubs, except replace swooning over Jon and Jaime to drooling over Dany. And, of course when he threatened to withhold sex for info I laughed and replied "that sounds as great punishment for you for not reading the books!" â<U+0080>¦ he immediately took back the threat.Â
3804	Bear Island	2014-05-14	For my Unsullied it's a combination of being really close to the truth and being way, way off.
My male friend:
- Isn't Dany great for being so nice to those people? She's going to be a great queen when she goes home!
- Cersei and Tyrion will both choose Jaime and Jaime will have to choose between them OR Tyrion won't have a champion and will have to fight
- Tyrion will win the trial by combat, but Cersei is going to have him killed (I think he's predicting it because he doesn't want to be surprised by another major character death)
- Stannis is so boring and shouldn't be in the show
- Thinks the two different Daario actors are two different characters, I had to explain they recast him
My female friend:
- Tyrion is requesting a trial by combat because he knows nobody will step up for him, and he's buying time pretending to look for a champion while he finds a way to escape. She also predicts Jaime will betray Cersei and Tywin and help him do so, along with Oberyn.
- The Hound and Arya will become close, he will die and she will go on a quest to avenge him
- Petyr is plotting to kill Lysa and control the Vale
- Oberyn is the best character on the show and if he somehow dies she will riot
My male friend tends to forget what happens season to season so I'm not surprised he doesn't have a clue. I'm quite impressed with my female friend picking up on the Petyr-Vale thing. When I asked her when she thought he was going to kill Lysa and control the Vale, she said because he 'gets everyone around him killed' and that 'he wants power BADLY'.
3805	SM4e	2014-05-14	I heard from several people and read several times (on neogaf) that they think Daenerys made a mistake by allowing Hizdahr to bury his father's corpse because it made her look weak. They all think that has been the actual mistake, not the crucifixions..
3806	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-05-14	Everyone thinks Jaimie and Bronn will fight in the Trial by combat. 
Everyone thought Drogon was awesome. 
Everyone thinks Stannis is boring. 
No one remembers anything beyond the last episode. Tyrions trial in the vale? "Where's that?"
3807	Howland'sMovingCastle	2014-05-14	Boyfriend: 'Well, I've seen a spoiler, so I know that Tyrion wins his trial by combat and goes to Essos' - the poor lad loves Oberyn, so he's going to be heartbroken.
'I was glad when the shepherd unrolled his bundle and it was just goat bones. I thought it was going to be his kid!' - just you wait...
He also thinks that there's no point in Dany even bothering with the Iron Throne. 'She's going to realise that she's already got an empire in Essos. There's plenty of stuff for her to do there!'
3808	Annara Snow	2014-05-14	The Unsullied at the TrekBBS were speculating who was gÄooing to fight who, but then one of them pointed out that episode 8 is called The Mountain and the Viper and that was it.

Because Daenerys is perfect. She shits sunshine and pukes rainbows. How could any of her badass decisions ever be poor? I'm starting to think that her fanboys/fangirls are part of why I dislike her so much.

I agree on Dany, but only because she's a girl and thus not heir to anything (at least by Westerosi laws). Now, if a legitimate, male Targaryen heir were to show up (not convinced on Aegon)... that might seriously shake up Stannis, IMO.Wrong. According to the Westeros law, she is the heir to the throne if there is no male Targaryen.
3811	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-14	Wrong. According to the Westeros law, she is the heir to the throne if there is no male Targaryen.


Â 
totally...this is why the dothraki system works, when the khal dies, the other immediately kill all his children so shit like this cant happen...robert had the right of things, to maintain the Baratheon dynasty, all Targ's needed to be killed...
Â 
truthfully, i quite disliked Dany in the books, but i cant deny that she has the strongest claim to the Throne...Stannis, being as honorable as he claims to be, should bend the knee to her and her dragons

Â 
The thing with Stannis is that he considers that Robert rightfully won the Iron Throne. From Stannis' point of view, Robert was the rightful king of the Seven Kingdoms: not by birthright, but by what is called "right of conquest". So the Targaryen dinasty is over and the Baratheons rightfully hold the throne.
Â 
My female friend has a major crush on Oberyn. I teased her that he was going to die in the next episode and she didn't even want to think about it. "If he ever dies I'll be so incredibly heartbroken and in ruins. Like, I liked Robb and suffered with his death, but I like Oberyn way more". I was so touched that I had to advise her "it's not wise to get too attached to any character in this show..."
By the way, she didn't remember who the Mountain wasÂ  Â My Unsullied are having a hard time following events lately: my flatmate never understood the Jon Arryn bussiness. My best friend is the only one who does keep track of virtually everything: he commented on how Petyr is amazing and in the end he was behind everything.

From Stannis' point of view, Robert was the rightful king of the Seven Kingdoms: not by birthright, but by what is called "right of conquest". So the Targaryen dinasty is over and the Baratheons rightfully hold the throne.
Â 
My female friend has a major crush on Oberyn. I teased her that he was going to die in the next episode and she didn't even want to think about it. "If he ever dies I'll be so incredibly heartbroken and in ruins. Like, I liked Robb and suffered with his death, but I like Oberyn way more". I was so touched that I had to advise her "it's not wise to get too attached to any character in this show..."
By the way, she didn't remember who the Mountain wasÂ  Â My Unsullied are having a hard time following events lately: my flatmate never understood the Jon Arryn bussiness. My best friend is the only one who does keep track of virtually everything: he commented on how Petyr is amazing and in the end he was behind everything.


Â 
 Â you make a really good point with the Right of Conquest,,,,but it should not apply when the children of the previous King are still alive...i know my way of thinking on this is very wrong but here's what I believe...
Â 
Targ's conquered, brought the 7 kingdoms together and ruled on nearly 300 yrs (minus 2 decades or so)
Robert rebelled, crushed the Targs and hence became rightful king...acceptable
Ruled about 2 decades or so.Â 
He left no trueborn children...
Â 
imo, last Targ kings trueborn children has much stronger claim than Robert's siblings...a 17 or so year reign should not give all the Baratheon heir's (no matter how distant) more claim to the Throne than the trueborn child of the previous king, whose family ruled for centuries...just IMO
Â 
if it turns out fAegon is actually Aegon, then i would probably think he has more claim than Dany...
Â 
about the names, totally, most of my unsullied friends mess up on the names alll the time...thankfully all of the ones i know got the Jon Arryn reveal...a friend of mine who just started S1 last week was asking if he should write down their names to try to remember them...i didn't want to make the watching harder for him, so just assured that he'd be fine after a few more episodes...
3814	Inv1ctus	2014-05-14	Think about giving your friend some charts of family trees (without spoilers obviously ) and also a map, the interactive one is pretty great. Before I read the books, these two things really helped me to get a better grasp on the ASOIAF universe. It's waaaaay more exciting if you can imagine where the people are going and especially at the time of war.Â
3815	ohpooratlas	2014-05-14	On the Daenerys making the wrong decision thing ...
Â 
I watched an unsullied review of the episode that basically said the same thing, but they did not believe the crucifixions were right either. They basically saw it as Daenerys painting herself into a corner by acting so rashly without heeding council. It tied into the whole "let me pay three times the value of your flock" to the sheepherder bit. She acts impulsively, without thinking her actions all the way through. Hizdar put her in an impossible position. Agree with him, and she looks weak, but refuse him and she looks like a callous monster. It was a lose lose situation.
Â 
So ... give the unsullied some credit. I've actually heard from more unsullied that they think Daenerys is inexperienced than anything else. They do not see her as this bad ass savior. They recognize that she's had it good because all she's done is conquered and liberated so far, but that just means a fall is coming ...
Â 
That same video from the unsullied reviewers I watched pointed out something I did not even think about.
Â 
Daenerys was irritated by the fact that Hizdar had his servant announce him, when she's clearly going through this effort to liberate everyone. Hizdar claims his father spoke against the crucifixion of the children and might have been one of the more "benevolent" slave masters, but that does not mean Hizdar shares his views. The fact that he would have a servant present him to her court is kind of contradictory to all that.
Â 
It's certainly something to think about.
3816	Lyanna<3Rhaegar	2014-05-14	My mom never remembers anyones name so trying decipher what she thinks is going to happen is a bit difficult at times. She did say "That whore is a dirty whore!" (Shae) She also thinks Bronn is Tyrion's 'designated' trial by combat guy so it has to be him fighting for him.
3817	Bear Island	2014-05-14	My mother only ever remembers Arya, I can't even really watch with her because it turns into me having to explain who everyone is, how they're related, what's going on and that takes longer than the show itself.
For once I watched a bit of the show with my Dad, and of course it was the first part with all the boobs.
Â 
Â 
The thing with right of conquest is that it completely negates the previous dynasty. That's just how it works. When conquest happens and a new king is crowned via right of conquest (ie. Robert Baratheon) it doesn't matter how many Targs are still alive, they have no right to the throne whatever they may believe. Dany has no right to the throne. fAegon has no right to the throne. Stannis has the rightful claim, it's that simple. That's just how it works, it's pretty black and white.
Of course, if you leave members of the previous dynasty alive they're going to be pissed and want win back the throne via conquest, as we've seen. That's why you need to kill off the previous dynasty.

Why?Â  Robert conquered Westeros and took the throne.Â  It doesn't matter if the king he deposed still has children out there.
Â 
imo, last Targ kings trueborn children has much stronger claim than Robert's siblings
Â 

The absence of children doesn't matter.Â  The Targaryens were deposed, and a Baratheon regime installed.Â  Stannis was previously designated heir before Robert's own (supposed) children were born, and Robert was entitled as king to enact his own succession laws.
3819	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-14	Yep. But then Dany's own claim will be one of conquest!

Actually, writing them down might be a good idea. Everybody structures information differently, so putting the names into your own little chart of characters might help.
3821	Kenyatta	2014-05-15	My friend was immediately like "I can't wait to see Tyrion name Oberyn as his champion after Cersei names Gregor". But he assumes that Oberyn is gonna winÂ

Agreed! I watch the show every week with 6 unsullied. One of them does this and he is always the one who constantly clears everything up for them. He's the only one to catch up to stuff even before it happens, and the only one with whom I'll talk show. The rest, I just listen and laugh at their fair weathered theories and blunders!Â

If your claim is based on the right of conquest...what if you aren't holding the throne and those who are have beaten you in battle? Do you still have that right to the throne? Stannis lost at Blackwater. Doesn't he need to win his throne, if his claim is based on the right of contest? Does anyone who wins the throne have the right to it? If, say, Euron Greyjoy won the throne in battle,  would that negate Stannis' claim? If you had a system based on the right of conquest, anyone with enough military force could hope to be the ruler, and there would probably be constant wars. 
On the other hand, strictly by hereditary rules, the Targaryen dynasty has most right to the Iron Throne, which they founded in the first place. But their rule of Westeros and the IT itself are based on a conquest 300 years ago. The Tullys ruling the Riverlands and the Tyrells ruling the Reach is also a consequence of the Targ conquest. Before that, the Riverlands were ruled by the Ironborne, who had conquered them. The Andals were conquerors once, as we're the First Men before them. 
GRRM wrote it in such a way that we have multiple people who legitimately believe that they are the rightful monarch, but the "rightfulness" is relative.
As for Aegon, I believe that he is fake, but he believes he is real. I also think he may be a Blackfyre. But it's also possible that the Blackfyre claim was legitimate,  since Daeron may have been Aemon's biological son - it's something no one can ever know for sure.
And does it really matter? Aerys was the "rightful" king,  but he was a mad tyrant. Robert won the throne,  and he was a pretty awful king.

Â 
It really is that simple. Whoever wins the throne by right of conquest, wins it for their line of succession. If Euron gets enough military power to fight and conquer then yes, it negates the power and rights of whoever he defeats. Yes, ANY person who can achieve enough military power and supporters can start a war and take the throne. Â 
Â 
That is the definition of right of conquest- not an interpretation. If you were not a good enough ruler to maintain the support of your subjects and not a good enough strategist to maintain the most force, you lose. This is the reason why the person sitting on the throne has to guarantee allegiance through marriages and concession so that he may retain enough supporters to maintain the largest military regime and therefore cannot be challenged.Â

(...)

Â 
As a book reader Im of a very similar opinion.
I also think it was a mistake to give in into Hizdahrs plead, not because I think the crucification was righteous but because it doesnt matter at this point. It really doesnt matter if she was right or not.
Now she has to stand up to her own decision because this is what a ruler is supposed to do. If she doesnt, it will be nearly impossible for her to rule in the future. She has to be consistent and as an absolute ruler her decisions have to be unquiestionable...

Correct, Good Intterpretation

Even Robert used his Targaryen grandma to justify his accession to the throne. Or else nobody would need to use blood and heritage to justify their kingship, Tywin Lannister would have made himself king, or the Tyrells would say: "Screw you, Lannisters, we don't need Tommen "Baratheon", we will just crown one of us.. how about Garlan?" And the Targaryens would have been deposed shortly after they lost their dragons. Nobody would follow child kings. And you'd probably have civil wars all the time, or something akin to military dictatorship- because, if the right of conquest trumps everything, why wouldn't everyone try to use it to get power, and why would anyone obey a ruler who can't crush them militarily at every time?

3830	binga	2014-05-15	I agree it is not simpleÂ and a combination of ancestry and conquest secure the throne. Ancestry is needed to bring some stability to the process or conquest would keep going on forever. There is a reason Euron wants Dany and Ramsay has a fake Arya with him. From Stannis's perspective he made a difficultÂ choice between blood and loyalty to his king and he chose blood but after he made that choice it was set in stone for him. Stannis will forever see Robert and his heirs as the rightful rulers of Westeros.
3831	Inv1ctus	2014-05-15	Come on now you Dany people, it's not like the Targaryens assembled the kingdoms peacefully. So truth of the matter is really that no one has the "right" claim to be the king/queen. Obviously the lords would follow anyone if such a person would have a great army which would subdue Westeros. There is almost no loyalty, only survival. Ancestry is really not needed if one would have strength in numbers. But since there isn't a house who would have overwhelmingly powerful army, of course people follow the bloodlines. Not because of the laws but because of survival and the status quo of society at hand, cause can't let them peasants think they are something they're not.Â

Oh man, you guys should totally have a sort of competition like write down their guesses for main events like the trial by combat, then see who got it right! Have some sort of a bet or reward or something  Wish I could do that.
Â 
Also whoever suggested it, I think writing down charts and stuff would be great to watch with Unsullied. I might do that.

You make an interesting point. I'll even forgive you your unpronounceable name :-p
Â 


GRRM wrote it in such a way that we have multiple people who legitimately believe that they are the rightful monarch, but the "rightfulness" is relative.
And does it really matter?


Totally agree with you. These endless discussions on who has the better claim sometimes cruelly lack perspective. Everybody believes what they want to believe. Or what suit them best. No not you guys, I meant the characters in the story.

I could see Stannis considering whether Daenerys or Aegon have a better claim and if he should bend the knee. I mean that guy does care a lot about law and justice and what's right and whatnot. Except Dany and Stannis are rivals in more ways than one. They both got Rhllor priests rooting for them and waiting for them to save the world. Stannis has Melisandre convincing him that he's Azor Ahai reborn, that he's got a destiny and a duty to fulfill it, he's meant to do great thing and his people need him.
So for that reason, I have a hard time believing Stannis could possibly side with Aegon. Now Daenerys, I would think not, but I'm not entirely sure.
3837	titanx5	2014-05-16	The only unsullied that watches with me is my mother (both me and my brother have read the books), it is rather annoying because she asks so many dam questions that keep on having to pause. Anyways what she thinks about certain characters
Â 
She only cares about Tyrion, "poor little guy"
Dany: Kinda a bitch, doesnt like her at all, especially after this episode "seems she is finally learning that its harder to rule, than just sacking cities"
Arya: Rude, disrespectful
Keeps on getting Stannis and LF's name confused (I dont know how that is humanly possible, but she has managed to)
Keeps thinking that if Tommen dies, the throne will pass to Jamie, keep on having to remind her Stannis is the rightful heir
Absolutely hates Cersei, even more than Joffrey, just wishes she would die a painful death
Ramsey sick crazy torturer guy
Hates Shae know "why does she betray him, I thought she loved him"
Â 
She is impartial to the rest cause she forgets most of them every week, you could put her in the lazy viewer category, she says their are to many characters
3838	lyanna_maria	2014-05-16	My flatmate feels guilty that she never remembers Ser Barristan's name haha If she knew what other people forget...
3839	Davos's Missing Fingers	2014-05-16	I'm surprised, honestly, at so many people thinking Jaime will be either side's champion. Â I mean, I get it on the surface-- but think about it. Â He hasÂ one fucking hand and is shown to not be such a good fighter. Â Neither side is dumb enough to risk the outcome on Jaime.


Â 
I could understand why viewers would think that Tyrion would avoid choosing Jaime since he knows that his older brother can't fight worth a lick anymore, but does Cersei know that? Jaime can still flash bravado and seem like he's confident. Plus Cersei was never trained with weapons, so chances are, despite her lamenting that she wasn't the one to be born male, she has no clue how hard it would be to fight with your left hand after fighting with your right your whole life. For all she knows, knights are trained with both hands.

Â 
He has a hard time keeping up with the massive quantity of characters and locations so he does appreciate the occassional pause-and-expand-on-the-scene-without-spoilers insights I give him.
Â 
For instance, when we saw Hizdar again I paused and reminded him I pointed him out as a significant character to watch when Dany was first outside the walls of Mereen. He said "Oh, right! The 'Lenny Kravitz' dude..." Yes! lol
3842	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-05-17	I feel like such a wanker when watching with my unsullied mates when I begin a sentence "in the books..." Or I pause it to say something. 
I do my best not to do these things because I couldn't imagine anything more irritating to people who just wanna chill out and watch the show with out some wanker going on and on about what happens in the books.
Having said that, I did ask them who they thought would fight in the trial and no one guessed the Mountain. 
My mate did think "that Spanish guy" would fight for Cersei against Tyrion who would fight by himself.

Â 
It happens to me too. I definitely learned long ago that any sentence that starts with 'in the books' is not welcomed. People who actually want to know how it is in the books, will read them.Â I guess they kind of feel that when you point something out, you're behaving like an "I have the books god", therefore, I have the power. That would be annoying. I would never spoil anything because I hate when things are spoiled for me...
Â 
(i.e. hated that sneak peak into the White walkers and thought that was a passive aggressive move by the producersâ<U+0080>¦ I mean, at east we warn before we spoil- ok rant over)
Â 
â<U+0080>¦but sometimes, I realize they have missed something and want them to get the full effect later on. So instead of making a "let me clarify for you moment" I subtly join in and add a bit of info. I did it with the whole Shae thing in the trial.
Â 
Someone said something about how it being especially cruel because she was the love of his life. I was appalled at this and knew later on they would not get the full impact of the Tysha confession. So, instead of straight correcting her, I went the round about way of Â I know, breaks my heart, it's so sad that no one ever loves him, do you remember his super sad story about the first girl he loved and now this?
Â 
I feel less smug and less 'in your face I know more then you'Â when I do it that way. They are also more receptive as they don't feel you're trying spoil their viewing experience by holding the books over them.

You hit the nail on the head there. That's exactly what "in the books..." comes across as. It's like discussing your favourite movies with friends and you talk about you favourite scenes (maybe exaggerating a little here or forgetting a few details there) and every time you make the slightest mistake someone comes in and says "actually that was actor X, not actor Y" or "actually that was at the end of the first movie, not at the beginning of the second one". It just really starts to grate on your nerves after a while, to the point where you want to grab that person, shake them and yell "I know I'm not getting it 100% right - can you please let me watch/talk in peace now?"
Â 
So, small advice to book lovers with Unsullied friends: if people want to know what happens in the books, they'll either read them (as you pointed out) or specifically ask you "is it like this in the books?"
Â 
Also, I applaud your approach to dropping information for your Unsullied friends. That's a great way to do it and I'm sure they are grateful for it
3845	ohpooratlas	2014-05-17	My unsullied coworker came up to me today and asked "how do the dragons know to eat the goats, but not the goat herder or his kid?"
Â 
It was the first time he hit a question dead on the nail and I just turned around and walked away from him. Lmao!
Â 
He said later he thought I walked away because it was such a dumb question and I was like "Nope. That's not it at all."

Â 


Stannis is the rightful heir, but if Cersei's children are still recognized as legitimate, if Tommen dies, the throne passes to Myrcella, right? She'd have to kick it before it passed to Stannis.
3847	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-05-18	Yep, as it stands, Stannis is third in line.

Â 
Holy shit.
Â 
I mean, it does give him a motive to poison her, if he was indeed the one behind it. But still, he's going to "court" her, negotiate with her, marry her, get a hard on and fuck her in a completely non rape fashion.
3849	Kungsmurfen	2014-05-12	At least it gave some humanity to the crucifictions that the books failed to provide. It also provided some background to his character that gives him more complexity than I thought the show would allow him to have. I liked it!
3850	Charles Phipps	2014-05-12	That's assuming all of it wasn't [censored].
Â 
His father may have directly ordered the children crucifyings himself.
Â 
However, talk is cheap and nothing prevents him from playing Daeny with the idea he was a "good" slaver who didn't treat his slaves any worse than the Smallfolk in Westeros.
Â 
History has shown that RL slavers have a well-known habit of talking about how the abuse of slaves was the actions of a small-minority.
Â 
Which, of course, is BS but serves their narrative.

I kinda wish they spent those eight minutes that were cut short this episode to give some more time to Meereen. They need to set up her council members like Shavepate and Brown Ben Plumm, maybe the green grace, if they're keeping them at all. It'll be nice to show Dany trying to assimilate to Meereen and maybe shut down the fighting pits, so Hizdahr can come in again to argue for them reopening.

Â 
He doesn't have to be the leader of the SoH to be "their guy." It is, however, crucial to Daeny's decision that marrying Hidzahr brings the violence to an end.
Â 
So I'll be interested in seeing where they go with it. It's about time we've seen a suitable challenge for Daeny, though.

3859	Hellfell	2014-05-12	Well when you come to a culture in which slavery is widely integrated and practiced (like ancient Rome and Egypt in RL) it's useless to tell them it's bad because they don't know anything else. It's their way of life and you have come to change it (violently I must add). Nobody will tolerate this. And it would be a bed assumption if you think that there are no good or brilliant people living in "slaver" cultures.Â

Â 
This is an argument made by some but wrong. The Romans, in particular, were well aware their slaves hated them and would kill them if they had the chance. It was a law that slaves could only give testimony under torture because it was assumed any slave would give false witness if it meant sticking it to a Roman. Likewise, freed slaves couldn't serve in the military because they assumed no slave would ever want to help a Roman.
Â 
The Confederacy had similar beliefs about their slaves but spent the next century after its fall trying to pretend it wasn't like that.

Really? Name one dothraki who ever spoke out against rape, cruelty or asked for some form of mercy, even the ones that follow Dany are so devoid of personality that you can't tell what they would do if she wasn't there....
Â 
I do agree that Hizdhar has the potential to be much more nuanced than the books, but lets not talk about the portrait of the dothraki as (show or books) as a good example...
Â 
Also, what reason do the dothraki have for being so horrible? The only reason I can think is because Martin wanted a foil for Dany in AGOT, but Martin never gives an lore reason why they are like that...

Â 
I'm utterly confused by your question. Why would the Dothraki speak out against rape or cruelty if they're horrible people?
Â 
If you mean for reasons, because the Dothraki culture is all about being the biggest baddest warriors around. You get their mindset even if it means they are actually just a bunch of bullies torturing and murdering people for plunder.
Â 
Just like Westeros' knights and Lords system is complete [censored] and evil but you have people like Ned Stark who think it's actually a good one. There's a rationale even if its nonsensical from the outside.
Â 
In RL, every slave holding society is one of exploitation, torture, and (historically) rape so the Mereen are going to be evil no matter what but you might be able to see how they don't think themselves that way.

At least it gave some humanity to the crucifictions that the books failed to provide.

Of course you can. You just failed to abstract from Daenerys' POV and her perception of the Sons of the Harpy.
Â 
From their perspective, she's a tyrant who sacked their city, cruelly executed random people including innocents and will bring them nothing but doom. They are too few to fight her in battle, so they fight her the only way they can, by attacking individuals from the shadows.
Â 
They stopped their killing, once they realized that Daenerys wasn't just mad and cruel (when she refused to kill her hostages), but that she could be reasoned with and agreed to marry Hizdhar.Â

Â
3874	Ran	2014-05-12	I like him less conceptually. Hizdahr's Meereenese patrician cut out of the same cloth as a Roman pater familias in the novels works quite well for me, whereas this is a somewhat more typical character, more "likable" in the sense that he's more emotive, but that's fairly cheap and easy. Actually seems to me like there's no very great reason why Daenerys might not come to find him appealing, if that's going to be how he usually comports himself.

Probably he was, but I think it's not only giving depth to the character, but even more so to the whole situation and Dany. She wants to be the savior and the good and just queen and this is also shown nicely by the farmer. You can really see her joy, when she plays the mother taking care of her "children" role with her paying him more than his goats were worth, him being thankful and then she gets confronted with the fact that being just and fair is not only for those that you like and suddenly ruling is way less fun, when you're not just giving out presents.

3892	Ran	2014-05-12	Hizdahr isn't remotely as he's being depicted above.
Â 
He's a pretty nuanced character: a wealthy patrician who, rather than swing to extremes (Shavepate, the Harpy's Sons [no, I don't believe he is the Harpy]) tries to work the middle course of compromise, the course that's actually the most reasonable under the circumstances if you don't want the streets awash with blood. He's trying to bridge the gap between traditional Meereenese slaver society and the regime Daenerys attempts to institute. That's not remotely "paper thin" or a "mustache twirling villain." The fact that he's a pragmatist, calm and in control of himself rather than full of fire and temperament makes him more interesting, not less, because Daenerys has had plenty of the latter in her life, people who despise her or adore her but rarely stand in between the extremes.
Â 
Sure, if you think he's the Harpy, I guess you put it all as an act. But then, I don't think the Harpy is evil, per se. They are insurgents attempting to preserve the traditional culture after a new regime has terribly destabilized them politically and economically. There's a pretty thin line between what one considers a terrorist and what one considers a freedom fighter, and usually it all depends on whose side you're on.

Â 
Um, what?!
Â 
Did you read some AU version of the books, or are you just one of those people who seem to have confused what actually happened in the books with some fanfic version of it they've come up with?
Â 
1) As QueenAlysanne already pointed out, Dany didn't refuse Quentyn because he wasn't pretty, she refused him because she was already marrying Hizdahr and it was too late to back up on it. Plus, Quentyn did not bring an army with him, so there was really no incentive to marry him. Although I guess she should have married him just to satisfy angry nerds who want to see a beautiful, powerful woman return an unattractive, shy man's love... or, wait, Quentyn wasn't in love with her and, for all we know, wasn't even particularly attracted to her. So, I guess Dany should have just broken her promise to Hizdahr and gone and married Quentyn and caused a major upheaval, chaos and conflict in Meereen (putting Quentyn's life in grave danger, BTW) just to please angry nerds who want to see a beautiful, powerful woman choose an unattractive, shy man even though she has no reason to do it at all?
Â 
2) Dany never "spurned" Hizdahr for Daario... sadly, she did the exact opposite. She sent Daario away as a hostage so she could marry Hizdahr for political reasons, to get peace. Or do you mean that she "spurned" his love?... Oh wait: Hizdahr definitely didn't love her and felt no passion for her, and she knew it, and he knew that she knew it. And that's exactly why she was so miserable in that marriage. Hizdahr is not supposed to be ugly, Dany thought he would be handsome if not for his hairstyle the first time she saw him, but the utter lack of love, passion or sexual chemistry is what marked this marriage as an utterly loveless one.
Â 
But I suppose you're still hoping that Dany "looks like an idiot" when... she has sex at one point with a guy she is sexually attracted to?
Â 
Err...

ha!
3906	Dragon of Valyria	2014-05-12	I'm not sure whether I believe Hizzy about his father's innocence. But that's irrelevant: the point is that it confirms what I said two weeks ago about Dany picking 163 masters at random to crucify without any pretense of an evidentiary finding (much less even a sham trial). It's hilarious that everybody thinks oh poor Tyrion when he at least gets the pantomime of witnesses and the right to a trial by combat. Compare that to Dany's tyrannical summary murders... 
I think the problem is that for the audience, slavery is such an intrinsic wrong that it justifies any action to destroy it. But that's crazy. Murder? Economic devastation? She's destroying the city she's trying to rule. 
Dany needs to learn to be able to institute change without resorting to brute force and tyranny. She's right to free the slaves. She's right (in the books) to insist they get paid for their labor. She's not right to murder. 
Also fwiw I agree with Ran about Hizzy. He's far from a bland villain. He's not competent enough for it. Admittedly I always thought he's the Harpy and that makes him a good actor. But if he's not, he's just this old-fashioned Meereenese noble. He's proud and honorable in the sense that a Meereenese might be: conscious of his dignity and his people's way of life. He wants to keep his city stable and while he probably disagrees with Dany, he's willing to work with her. 
He's just this ineffectual guy.  It's kinda hilarious.

I think Martin is making a point the world doesn't really run on fairness. Daeny would have gotten better results by just killing all of the Masters and taking their populations to Westeros. Also, confiscating all their property. It would have been grossly unfair but fairness doesn't really matter in war.
Â 
As Jorah said, Aegon didn't conquer the Seven Kingdoms because they were his right--he conquered them because he had dragons.
3909	jarl the climber	2014-05-12	How is trying to balance two opposing forces two-dimensional? You're literally the third point in a three-dimensional problem!


The problem with Hizadar in the books is that he seems like a craven, hes materialistic and venal and that whatever his personal motivations might be he is essentially a puppet being used by other actors. I agree that he is three dimensional but he is not sympathetic nor is he interesting in himself as a character.
3910	Ran	2014-05-12	I get confused when people talk about how they like a character more often seems to mean the same thing as the character becoming more likable. It's not a popularity contest. The quality of a character as a presentation by an author should be independent of whether we actually root for them or not.
Is he a craven? In what way? He went out on a limb to some degree, being a voice of compromise, and arguably faced personal danger (from Skahaz Shavepate, if no one else) in his attempt to achieve a compromise (favorable to himself, of course, but still a compromise).

C19:
Yes, GRRM's world is harsh. But I brought up Westeros for a reason: she wants to be a Westerosi queen and sees the Essosi (particularly Ghiscari) as backwards and barbaric, yet here she is ruling as an absolute despot in a fashion that even the Westerosi would find repellant and excessive. 
I don't mean that Dany should apply the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I understand GRRM's world is a brutal one, a realistic medieval fantasy. 
But I'm saying that Dany is a brutal tyrant even by the standards of that world. She thinks she's doing good -- she tries to do good -- but she lets her emotions get the best of her. 
And as a backer of her and her claim, that makes me really sad.

The general impression that I get from reading the discussions on the boards is that Hizadar is viewed as being a speed bump when people discuss Dany and that even if they are condescending enough to even admit that he exists and is married to Dany and that the marriage is legally binding and has been consumated. The general consensus is that between Skahaz, Victorian and the Dothraki he seems predestined to play the role of a victim. Certainly he is not any sort of warrior that is made very clear and that in itself does not make him a craven but his response to being arrested seemed undignified, it reinforces this impression of him, that he is an empty suit
Â 
Personally I'm unsure what happens with Mereen, I can't see Dany simply abandoning it, therefore I feel her marriage might still have some importance going forward, that this fellow is not going to just go away but I'm in a very small minority.
3913	Lady of the Falls	2014-05-12	This guy is gonna marry and fuck the woman who crucified his father.
Â 
Holy shit.
Â 
I mean, it does give him a motive to poison her, if he was indeed the one behind it. But still, he's going to "court" her, negotiate with her, marry her, get a hard on and fuck her in a completely non rape fashion.


If they stick to the book. Â The actor playing him is a let down, it doesn't seem plausible that she'd even be a little attracted to him. Politics or not. He doesn't stand out at all as someone important.
3914	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-05-12	I pictured Hizdahr as an older man, kind of like an Essos version of Littlefinger, but a bit older, and less conniving. Like a stuffy middle aged man who is set in his ways regarding how things are done. But this version of Hizdahr could work too.

Â 

Â 
True. GRRM's choice not to give us an Essosian pov because, to paraphrase GRRM, Essos is not the story, and yet spend a big portion of the book caused that storyline to suffer in that all the inhabitants of that world became cardboard cutouts. We only see them from one point of view, a point of view I might add that is not very interested in gathering knowledge, and we know very little about them. We have an impression of them, a one sided impression, but we don't know them. Therefor any nuance and depth the show can add to that world I absolutely welcome, regardless of whether that nuance may or may not match exactly the meagre impressions we have of those characters from the books.Â

3916	Citabel	2014-05-12	Â 
I'm utterly confused by your question. Why would the Dothraki speak out against rape or cruelty if they're horrible people?
Â 
If you mean for reasons, because the Dothraki culture is all about being the biggest baddest warriors around. You get their mindset even if it means they are actually just a bunch of bullies torturing and murdering people for plunder.
Â 
Just like Westeros' knights and Lords system is complete [censored] and evil but you have people like Ned Stark who think it's actually a good one. There's a rationale even if its nonsensical from the outside.
Â 
In RL, every slave holding society is one of exploitation, torture, and (historically) rape so the Mereen are going to be evil no matter what but you might be able to see how they don't think themselves that way.


The dothraki are the Greyjoy's of Essos. They even have their own sea.

Â 


Â 
Not really. The only reason they might find it excessive is that she did it to a bunch of nobles. Had she crucified 163 random smallfolk I doubt most of the high lords of Westeros would even care.
3920	Thelastactionhero	2014-05-12	Hizdahr isn't remotely as he's being depicted above.
Â 
He's a pretty nuanced character: a wealthy patrician who, rather than swing to extremes (Shavepate, the Harpy's Sons [no, I don't believe he is the Harpy]) tries to work the middle course of compromise, the course that's actually the most reasonable under the circumstances if you don't want the streets awash with blood. He's trying to bridge the gap between traditional Meereenese slaver society and the regime Daenerys attempts to institute. That's not remotely "paper thin" or a "mustache twirling villain." The fact that he's a pragmatist, calm and in control of himself rather than full of fire and temperament makes him more interesting, not less, because Daenerys has had plenty of the latter in her life, people who despise her or adore her but rarely stand in between the extremes.
Â 
Sure, if you think he's the Harpy, I guess you put it all as an act. But then, I don't think the Harpy is evil, per se. They are insurgents attempting to preserve the traditional culture after a new regime has terribly destabilized them politically and economically. There's a pretty thin line between what one considers a terrorist and what one considers a freedom fighter, and usually it all depends on whose side you're on.


Excellent assessment. I personally think that Hizdahr is already being colored with a more sympathetic air than he was in the books, but I can definitely see him playing this role as the pragmatic bridge between tradition and Dany's new regime going forward.
3921	Seneti	2014-05-12	I really liked him. Joel Fry is perfect.Â 
Â 
I applaud the show's HZL Â being a likable character, it avoids the books' major failing of having all Dany's adversaries depicted as risible & thoroughly unpleasant.Â 


Â 


I think the Hizdahr/Dany thing is going to be a lot more interesting than it is in the books. He's stronger and more motivated, she's getting it wrong in a lot of fundamental ways.


Â 
Agreed. So far, I prefer show HZL to book HZL. It's good to see someone finally pointing out all the flaws in Dany's actions.


I'm not sure whether I believe Hizzy about his father's innocence. But that's irrelevant: the point is that it confirms what I said two weeks ago about Dany picking 163 masters at random to crucify without any pretense of an evidentiary finding (much less even a sham trial).

I think the problem is that for the audience, slavery is such an intrinsic wrong that it justifies any action to destroy it. But that's crazy. Murder? Economic devastation? She's destroying the city she's trying to rule.


Â 
This. For all that we know, Hizdahr may be lying about everything, but that doesn't change the fact that he brings up some very good points about Dany's conquest and the morality of her actions. Let's hope we'll also get to see the parts of the book where former slaves escape to Quarth & Co., begging to be sold back into slavery, because they did fare a lot better under a benign master than under a conquerer queen who destroys their entire economy in one go.

3924	Pib_Juju	2014-05-12	At least it gave some humanity to the crucifictions that the books failed to provide. It also provided some background to his character that gives him more complexity than I thought the show would allow him to have. I liked it!

I had the impression that TV-Hizzy was a smart and experienced enough power-player to control himself when facing his father's murderer who has an army and three fire-breathing dragons at her disposal. Â He's not Brandon Stark to stomp up to Dany's perimeter and yell "Come out and die!". Â I thought he was exhibiting a lot of self-control; that he definitely was aggrieved by Dany's killing of his father, but knew he was dealing with a young, full-of-herself and powerful new ruler. Â He seemed to alter between showing deep feeling for his father's death and wanting to bury the man and needing to placate the h*ll out of the capricious new Queen of Mereen.

I could more so see this guy as someone Dany would tolerate at her side than Book Hizdahr. Just the right kind of person to manipulate her into marriage while planning to poison her. She is so out of her league. The look she gets from Selmy after the goat herd's compensation is priceless and then she gets all pissy automatically with the next supplicant only to have to eat it when he just asks to bury his father. The same bad choices lie ahead for her as in the books.
3937	ohpooratlas	2014-05-12	The unsullied I've talked to have been split on the whole crucifying the masters thing, just as the book readership has been.
Â 
It'll be interesting to see how they react to the fallout from this episode.
Â 
Anyway. I'm fully on board with Hizdar. I may even possibly already ship him and Dany, not for the romance but for the obvious conflict that will be there when they are married.
3938	Belisarius09	2014-05-12	In other news, the Hizdar scene really struck a note with the non-book reader community.Â  People are finally starting to be turned off by the actions of their once beloved "Khaleesi."
Â 
I've really enjoyed reading the reviews by non book readers.Â 
Â 
"Dany has taken her throne and learns that she might have been wise to take Selmyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s advice in terms of â<U+0080><U+009C>mercyâ<U+0080><U+009D>, at least for some of the residents of Meereen.Â  Dany learns that the non-slave residents were not all cruel slave owners and crucifiers of children.Â  The point here to me was that in the future Dany might be wise to get all facts before passing judgment and implicating punishment, which somewhat correlates to what we would see later with Tyrion. She makes the right decision for Hizdahr, but her arrogance at times during the conversation was a huge turn-off.
Â 
A little more truth:Â  I find myself repeatedly struggling to stay involved with Danyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s story.Â  I think the conflict lies with the idea that we the viewers have been led to believe that we should like her character.Â  But the more I see of her, the more I find myself growing to dislike her, and maybe that is the intent.Â  After all, she does come from a line of family that included the Mad King and her own brother, Viserys.Â  The apple doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t fall far from the tree, or so they say."
Â 
I count this as a victory for team Stannis.Â  Its just a few pebbles rolling down the hill for now, but eventually it will turn to a landslide and the initially reluctant supporters will rally to his cause.

Well, it's easy to check if his father was indeed crucified. Getting to know if he really spoke against the crucifixions is harder.
3943	Rhaquentis	2014-05-12	I like him being more complex and would like to see more of him. Any idea how many eps he's credited in? Is that the last we've seen of him for now 'till next season?
3944	Peter George Stewart	2014-05-12	The whole thing with the sympathetic dad angle was absurd.Â  GRRM doesn't do that in the books, and there's absolutely no reason to do it in the tv series either.Â 
Â 
Suppose the dad had been against crucifying a disembowelled-while-alive child at every mile to Mereen, then when he was voted down he should have left and sided with Dany.Â  If he doesn't do something of that nature and GTFO of such a horrific culture - especially when, as a rich person he has the resources to do so - then as one of the Masters, he shares in their collective guilt as the rulers who ordered the thing done.
Â 
I have no sympathy with any of them whatsoever. In that culture, in that context, I would do exactly as Dany did - do unto them what they did to the children, and worse.
Â 
The sole factor mitigating against what Dany did is the pragmatic point that Barristan Selmy pointed out.Â  It might have been cannier to spare them, because of unforeseen consequences.Â  But it would not have been just.

Â 
See - I find this a real problem. Hizdahr in the books was NOT cute. He was balding with a big hooked nose if I remember correctly. He was also obnoxiously droll and entitled as nobles in Meereen who owned slaves were. Now they've gone and cast yet another handsome guy in Dany's circle of men - blargh. It's bad enough Jorah Mormont has a voice that could melt the panties off most women and is far more likable and good looking than Jorah from the books was. Let's not even get started on the two different versions of Daario who neither one has strange dyed hair, beard or gold tooth to complete the ridiculous look.Â 
Â 
It's like they are surrounding Dany with a posse of sexy adoring men and then expecting us to believe she stays aloof and uninterested.Â
3947	Florina Laufeyson	2014-05-12	I thought Book!Hizdahr was a youngish man with radical hair-wings and a beard. So pretty sure yer wrong about that one...
Â 
Â

Yes they are. People are kinda like "dude what." And having a hard time buying that Dany has the moral high ground. Hizdahr's sob story only adds to this.Â 
Â 
I like Hizdahr already and i like his sob story. Its pretty obvious hes bullshitting and trying to get a real good feel for what kind of person his new ruler is.Â He was also there to wag his finger at her with "you did this indiscriminately and thats not nice." and kind of pointing out her hypocrisy on the subject.Â 

Â 
She makes the right decision for Hizdahr, but her arrogance at times during the conversation was a huge turn-off.

oh yes. It was enough to make a person wince. Clarke was ok with the delivery as it was kind of wooden (indicating self-doubt) and petulant. "But im in the right! ME! IM IN THE RIGHT!" and Hizdahr is all "not really, no." but it does make her come off as incredibly insufferable. Especially when she asks Missandei how many more cases there are, Dany looks like a kid in a time-out going "how long??"
3948	King Tommen	2014-05-12	Â 
See - I find this a real problem. Hizdahr in the books was NOT cute. He was balding with a big hooked nose if I remember correctly. He was also obnoxiously droll and entitled as nobles in Meereen who owned slaves were. Now they've gone and cast yet another handsome guy in Dany's circle of men - blargh. It's bad enough Jorah Mormont has a voice that could melt the panties off most women and is far more likable and good looking than Jorah from the books was. Let's not even get started on the two different versions of Daario who neither one has strange dyed hair, beard or gold tooth to complete the ridiculous look.Â 
Â 
It's like they are surrounding Dany with a posse of sexy adoring men and then expecting us to believe she stays aloof and uninterested.Â  


Â 
He was actually a pretty good looking guy (definitely not balding with a big nose) as described in the books. Dany wasn't attracted to him because of his personality and sliminess, the looks weren't the problem.
3949	Envie	2014-05-12	I thought Book!Hizdahr was a youngish man with radical hair-wings and a beard. So pretty sure yer wrong about that one...
Â 


Â 
Ok I'm probably getting the physical description of Hizdar and Reznak or whoever confused. I'll confess I really lost interest in all those toadies that started coming into Dany's court all the time during the Meereen soap opera. I do remember all of them being described as ugly with weird beards, mustaches and hairstyles. Of course this was from young Dany's POV so who knows - but she did find Daario attractive even with the same ridiculous Essos hairstyles going on.
Â 
My point about the show still stands however. They're casting a whole lot of really good looking guys around Dany and it's less believable to me.
3950	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-12	I like Hizdahr already and i like his sob story. Its pretty obvious hes bullshitting and trying to get a real good feel for what kind of person his new ruler is.Â He was also there to wag his finger at her with "you did this indiscriminately and thats not nice." and kind of pointing out her hypocrisy on the subject.Â 
oh yes. It was enough to make a person wince. Clarke was ok with the delivery as it was kind of wooden (indicating self-doubt) and petulant. "But im in the right! ME!

Â 
I actually like that. I mean, the scene was bad for Dany, I admit, but there we have her, regretting her own decisions, decisions that she took by herself, while her advisers told her otherwise. It shows her commitment to rule, even though her ruling is a mess: she wanted to be the Queen and now she's a Queen, she has no one to tell her do this or that, it's all up to her.
Â 
Contrast that with Tommen, who was there only to say "look, I'm the King!" and Stannis who had pretty much the same titles, but he was broke, until his own man talked in his behalf.
3951	Dornishwoman's Husband	2014-05-12	I suspect Hizdahr lied about his father's innocence in crucifying slave children. He's a fu*king harpy's son.

3954	Lord Damian	2014-05-12	Â 
Yeah he's already a more complex character than in the books. I hope it doesn't turn out to be LIES ALL ALONG!! and we get another Xaroesque cartoon villain.


In the books though, Essos is full of cartoon villians, Especially Dany's lovers
3955	RhysHenry	2014-05-12	At least it gave some humanity to the crucifictions that the books failed to provide. It also provided some background to his character that gives him more complexity than I thought the show would allow him to have. I liked it! 


THIS!
I'm under the impression that Dany is gonna go batshit crazy like The Mad King so it put some perspective into it, rather than just making it seem like she can do no wrong.Â
3956	Mr. Sven	2014-05-12	This guy is gonna marry and fuck the woman who crucified his father.
Â 
Holy shit.
Â 
I mean, it does give him a motive to poison her, if he was indeed the one behind it. But still, he's going to "court" her, negotiate with her, marry her, get a hard on and fuck her in a completely non rape fashion.



I don't think he poisoned her, I'm pretty sure it was the guy who was manipulating BarristanÂ
3957	Nictarion	2014-05-12	I count this as a victory for team Stannis.Â  Its just a few pebbles rolling down the hill for now, but eventually it will turn to a landslide and the initially reluctant supporters will rally to his cause.Twilight mentality at it's finest.

Yeah, I'm hoping that they're going the same way with Dany as they (finally) started going with Tyrion. GRRM has always been very open about how Dany's story is about the difficulty in ruling, so I'm assuming she's gonna get owned a few more times this season and next.
Hizdar was fantastic. I like him more than in the books! Can't wait to see where they go with him in S5...
I also really like how in each of the 3 main scenes ( just going to pretend the Ironborn plot wasn't part of it) there were supplicants facing three judges. It was a nice reflection of how each supplicant came out with a different outcome:
-Stan had a well-reasoned argument - via Davos - including proof, and got what he deserved;
-Hizdar and the goatherd both basically owned Dany, who showed how naive she is;
-Tyrion got stabbed in the back during his farce of a trial, and we all know the outcome of that.

I don't really see how you can blame the show for that though, if it's a carry-over "problem" from the book. I can see blaming them for Jorah, for example, but not for Hizdahr who even Dany admitted was fairly attractive in the books.

Â 
Not sure where I was blaming the show for anything. I've made an opinion that all of the actors cast for all of the males in Dany's crew are overly handsome (and not portrayed with strange looks like Essos males were) but that's a problem for the entire show, even Tyrion is handsome and most definitely was not described that way in the books. It's a hollywood thing.
3961	Mad Monkey	2014-05-12	My mistake. I thought you were implying that there was some kind of problem with the casting of Hizdahr.Â
3962	Jairion Lannister	2014-05-12	I thought it was interesting what they did with him. So far they've shied away from Daenerys' ambiguous side which she has at times, but this really showed it to us and gave him more of a sympathetic side. I think a lot of the people Daenerys meets in Essos are fairly one-dimensional, however this could add some complexity to someone who becomes more important. Of course he could be lying to make her feel sorry for him, but it's an interesting portrayal nevertheless.

Â 
Hollywood syndrome for adaptations is definitely a thing, but GOT is really not a terrible offender in that respect, on balance. There are a few male characters on the show who are smoking hot who were either average or even ugly in the books (Tyrion, Jorah, etc.), but there are also a few male characters on the show who are less attractive than their book counterparts are supposed to be (Theon, Loras, Renly, etc.), and on balance most of the male characters on the show are roughly as attractive as their book counterparts (Tywin, the Hound, Jaime, Varys, Sam, etc.).
Â 
Hizdahr is described in the books as tall, slender, with "flawless amber skin" and a "long face." He has "wings of wiry red-black hair sprouting from his temples," and a "beard bound with rings of gold." Dany even thinks that "He would be handsome, but for that silly hair." I'd say Joel Fry (Hizdahr) is a good match for the character as described, although I don't think his GOT hair's silly. Handsome? Check. Wiry, dark hair? Check. Flawless amber skin? Check. Tall? Check. Slender? Check.

3964	Florina Laufeyson	2014-05-12	I fail to see the problem with Dany having a host of nice looking blokes on her side. Wynaut? Besides, the Shavepate. He will cancel out the hotness with his sliminess.
3965	ground_control	2014-05-12	It's not openly stated in the books, but when you pick 163 random noblemen to be crucified without a trial, of course there are going to be innocents among them.Â 


Actually, per the books, the 163 are not chosen at random, Dany calls for 163 of their leaders and specifies for which crime (crucifying the children) they will be crucified. Â The slavers themselves choose who takes the fall. Â Not the best procedure, but if any are innocent, they were chosen by their own people on purpose, not by Dany at random.
3966	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-12	I find Joel Fry very handsome. Not every handsome man looks like Brad Pitt or Thor-babe. I definitely wouldn't mind marry him.

I like nice looking Hizdahr. Makes it seem a little less painful for Dany to marry him eventually. The viewers will buy it. I wonder if they include Quent, if hes not going to be attractive...im getting too far ahead...

Â 
Thanks for quoting the description of Hizdahr from the book. I still imagined almost all of the men from Meereen as looking ugly and pompous for some reason - it must have been the goofy hair-wings and various colors of adornment which gave the impression of feathered birds. I guess this television version is just so 'normal' and handsome looking I took exception to it hehe.
Â 
I also do 'get it' why they toned down Daario and others (lacking weird forked beards and dyed hair) - it wouldn't have translated as well to the television screen and would have just looked goofy.
3969	El Guapo	2014-05-12	Sure, such rights to trial only apply to the highborn.
Yet Dany still fails to meet that pitifully low hurdle. What does that say about her?


Â 
That she believes the life of a high born isn't worth any more than that of a low born?
3970	Mad Monkey	2014-05-12	Actually, per the books, the 163 are not chosen at random, Dany calls for 163 of their leaders and specifies for which crime (crucifying the children) they will be crucified. Â The slavers themselves choose who takes the fall. Â Not the best procedure, but if any are innocent, they were chosen by their own people on purpose, not by Dany at random.


Â 
That's actually worse. Since the Great Masters choose the crucifixion victims, they would probably choose the minority faction to take the brunt of it -- that is, the people who spoke out against killing the children, the people who wanted to bend the knee to Dany (as the Yunkishmen did), or even any abolitionists in the group. This might mean that the people who survived are the most dangerous, cunning, and ruthless of the Great Masters, while the people who died were the ones who would be most likely to collaborate with Dany's regime.
Â 
Of course I'm not saying that this is for sure what happened, but realistically if you get a bunch of people like this to decide who to die chances are the strongest and most ruthless will force the weaker members to take the fall. Maybe Hizdahr is lying, but if he is telling the truth then it wouldn't be unusual for his father -- who spoke out against the murder of children -- to have been chosen for sacrifice since he already stuck his neck out once.
3971	Lady of Dragonstone	2014-05-12	This was my favorite scene this episode. I applaud the casting of Hizdahr - very attractive, very smooth so far. He looks just as I imagined him, though a bit younger perhaps.
Â 
This scene was subtle and that is why I loved it. Emilia's facial expressions belie what Daenerys is thinking, and I love it. Her attitude towards him at first was awesome. One thing I cannot agree with is that I did not find her petulant at all and I can't really see why others are saying so. She asks Missandei how many people are in line, shows emotion for one second in (almost) privacy, puts on her big girl panties and gets on with it.. so classy.
Â 
I can see that the show will be setting this up soon, and the Unsullied will be conflicted between Hizdahr and Daario for Dany. I think this storyline in Meereen, at least, has good potential.
3972	cade	2014-05-12	The whole thing with the sympathetic dad angle was absurd.Â  GRRM doesn't do that in the books, and there's absolutely no reason to do it in the tv series either.Â 
Â 
Suppose the dad had been against crucifying a disembowelled-while-alive child at every mile to Mereen, then when he was voted down he should have left and sided with Dany.Â  If he doesn't do something of that nature and GTFO of such a horrific culture - especially when, as a rich person he has the resources to do so - then as one of the Masters, he shares in their collective guilt as the rulers who ordered the thing done.
Â 
I have no sympathy with any of them whatsoever. In that culture, in that context, I would do exactly as Dany did - do unto them what they did to the children, and worse.
Â 
The sole factor mitigating against what Dany did is the pragmatic point that Barristan Selmy pointed out.Â  It might have been cannier to spare them, because of unforeseen consequences.Â  But it would not have been just.


Â 
Â 
Yeah, I'm not on board the Hizdahr sympathy train. He bragged about his father's buildings that were built with slave labor. Dany being very young, inexperienced and uneducated, she's naturally a poor debater. Hooray to Hizdahr for outwitting her. He's lucky Dany doesn't redistribute all the wealth that was made off the backs of slaves, which she should've done immediately.
Â 
That said, I tend to believe Hizdahr's story, only because I think the writers do, and I like that they didn't gloss over Dany's injustice like Martin did. It seems likely to me that at least one of the 163 was against the child crucifixions, but even that is beside the point, which is that their guilt wasn't proven. Albeit not from Dany's perspective, as she considered the leaders of the Great Masters to be collectively guilty by virtue of their position. As you note, they could've and should've at least resigned in protest.
Â 
Crucifixion and collective punishment are inherently unjust but the latter is standard in that world and precedent for the former was set by the Great Masters. Dany was actually relatively lenient in only selecting an equal number to the children they crucified, rather than, say, three times that number as she did for the goatherder.
Â 


Actually, per the books, the 163 are not chosen at random, Dany calls for 163 of their leaders and specifies for which crime (crucifying the children) they will be crucified. Â The slavers themselves choose who takes the fall. Â Not the best procedure, but if any are innocent, they were chosen by their own people on purpose, not by Dany at random.


Â 
Yes, her having the 163 selected at random is yet another widely believed falsity. It's also often claimed that the Great Masters just chose the weakest and least influential to be among the 163, and maybe that's what they attempted before being overriden by Dany, but either way the 163 included three uncles of the powerful House Pahl. This almost certainly included the Pahl uncle described by Brown Ben Plumm as being "the richest man in Meereen." The Pahls are later said to be "A house of women now."
Â 
For all the past claims of "whitewashing," the show made Dany look much worse by giving the appearance that 163 random slavers were crucified, rather than the leaders of the Great Masters. In the books, no one counseled against the crucifixions and no one claimed one of the 163 was innocent. I like the latter two changes but the former makes no sense, imo.

Â 
It's obvious that Dany male entourage had to be, let's say, "enhanced". Barristan is old, Jorah is a bear (and not a pretty one), his Unsullied are all eunuchs and Daaaaario looks like a Lady Gaga Dancer.
Â 
But Iain Glen is gorgeous, there is not one single reason for Dany to not be attracted to him, really. So, Daaaaaario needs to have more looks and be different than Jorah, which they already fuck up. And Hizdar, he needs to be "ok". I think the actor is "Ok" for tv standards. They all are pretty, Barristan, jorah, Daario, even Greyworm. He's so cute.
3974	Carey Snow	2014-05-12	Â 
That's only if the Shavepate theory is true. They could well have poisoned her.


Only the Shavepate theroy makes sense. No reason to think that Dany would like locusts. Hizdahr is the one that pubically likes locusts and would be the likely target.
Â 
Dany likes fruits and dates, and an occasional horse's heart.
3975	Thelastactionhero	2014-05-12	Â 
Yes they are. People are kinda like "dude what." And having a hard time buying that Dany has the moral high ground. Hizdahr's sob story only adds to this.Â 


It's interesting because a lot of the readership either feels that we're not supposed to care about her crucifying them or sympathize with the slavers because they mostly deserve it, while the Dany haters note that her decision to crucify 163 people without any kind of investigation shows how evil she is. For my part, I think the situation is nuanced, like all of the moral dilemmas George creates for his character. In a lot of ways, the show actually handles this better than the books by including Hidzar's father, a voice against the murder of the slave children, as one of those she executes. Finally shows us what's been missing from her arc with all this freedom fighting. I actually think it was easily my favorite Dany scene since season 2. Not because I think it made her look bad or evil, but because it made her look human, like a young girl trying to be a ruler who understandably makes mistakes while trying to do the right thing.

3977	PhoenixFlame	2014-05-12	I feel David Chen (technically an Unsullied) on the Cast of Kings podcast does a great job discussing these layered issues. Can't wait for this week's recap/review.Â 
Â 
Personally, I think what is just or unjust by our standards isn't necessarily incompatible when applied to ancient/fictional cultures, but it should be acknowledged when it's irrelevant due to Â culture/time equivalents. Dany isn't wrestling with issues of moral relativism, she's working with people who are pissed (or will soon become pissed) that she broke their economy and uprooted their lifestyles, even if it was in the name of freeing downtrodden peoples.Â

3979	Seneti	2014-05-13	I like this Hizdahr more because I actually noticed him. He was just there for me in the books. I didn't dislike him but never really gave him much thought (unlike the Green Grace). This guy had some nice polished intensity. Clearly trained in courtier ways, but if a lot of it is an act, he knew how to inject believable emotion. Speaking of the character, not the actor. The actor was great--really, really liked his voice. Pretty cute too. Damn he has nice skin. I loved Dany's "well this is awkward" face.Â 


Â 
I agree with all of this. Hizdahr in the books was always such a non-entity to me. When she first decided to marry him, I actually had to look him up online because I could not for dear life remember who he was and what part he had played in her story so far. I think show Hizdahr will be in my memory for a long time.
Â 


Â 
Contrast that with Tommen, who was there only to say "look, I'm the King!" and Stannis who had pretty much the same titles, but he was broke, until his own man talked in his behalf.


Â 
Hm... you're right, there are some interesting parallels there. So far we have had:
Â 
- a cruel king who never listened to his advisers (Joffrey)
- a kind king who never listened to his advisers (Robb)
- a kind queen who only occasionally listens to her advisers (Dany)
- a kind king who always listens to his advisers (Tommen)
- a lawful neutral king who seems undecided as to whom to listen to (Stannis)
Â 
Pity the seven kingdoms...

When the dornishmen reveal themselves, we're privy to Daenerys' thoughts. She thinks how plain Quentyn is and how much better it would have been, if Drinkwater had been the prince instead of him.
Â 
I don't know, I can't help but thinking that if the dornish prince had been a young, dashing Aurane Waters like character who offered her the support of Dorne and a way to conquer the seven Kingdoms, she wouldn't have refused him so quickly.Â 
Â 
And similarly, I'm not sure she would have married Quentyn even if she hadn't yet been betrothed to Hizdhar. He's even more unattractive, both physically and character wise.
Â 
Daenerys didn't seem very saddened that her situation "forced" her to refuse Quentyn. I think she was kind of glad. if she had wanted him, there was nothing that could have stopped her from doing so.

She absolutely turned down Quentyn because of her upcoming marriage (literally the next day) and her duty to her people. She was completely in love with Daario at that point and she stopped sleeping with him once she got married, so I doubt she'd throw away everything she was working for in Meereen if Drink was the prince instead of Quentyn.

Well, as I said, it's rather easy to double check if Hizdahr father was indeed crucified. It's a lot harder to verify if he actually spoke against the crucifixion of children. And being a slavist owner of gladiator doesn't mean he didn't love his father
3986	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-13	If they stick to the book. Â The actor playing him is a let down, it doesn't seem plausible that she'd even be a little attracted to him. Politics or not. He doesn't stand out at all as someone important.


What are you on? Joel Fry is ADORABLE.Â
3987	Bannerman_Forrester	2014-05-16	Â 
Sounds like a rip off of Old Valyria's Battle Royale tournaments.


To me it's more of the Andal's "Running Man" completition.
Â 
Anywho Hizdahr was fantastic! I did enjoy this episode for more then just the trial, the fact it made Dany seem not so good compared to the massive white wash "Goodie two-shoes" she's been so far. Plus Miss Clark found her acting chops.

3988	Pod The Impaler	2014-05-16	Â The point here to me was that in the future Dany might be wise to get all facts before passing judgment and implicating punishment, which somewhat correlates to what we would see later with Tyrion. She makes the right decision for Hizdahr, but her arrogance at times during the conversation was a huge turn-off.
Â 
After all, she does come from a line of family that included the Mad King and her own brother, Viserys.Â 
Â 


Â 
Â 
Well, yeah. I would say I am generally in Dany's side when she resorts to wrathful justice, but she has a dragon's temper, and also was raised by Viserys in a tradition of arrogance and entitlement with a very distorted view of the world and herself. In S1, Jorah has to wake her up to the reality that the common people in Westeros don't care much for who has the right to what seat of power. In S2, she finds the Qartheen perfectly willing to turn her away to starve, save for 2 of the 13 who seek to use her and steal her dragons. In S3, she wants to buy slaves to further her cause, but her disgust at how the Unsullied are made and her annoyance at the Kraznys' insults to her that convince her to crush Astapor.Â 
Â 
So while I think Dany has some good ideals and good instincts, she is not Saint Daenerys. Kings and queens are not in the habit of being told they are wrong, least of all by anyone sympathetic to their foes. Would Stannis have done similarly ? Yes. If he is willing to burn people alive, I think so - and he would not be moved as easily by Hizdahr's seeming anguish. One he made his decision, he would have stuck by it regardless. Would Robb Stark ? Compare the mercy he showed his mother with the lack of it which he showed Karstark and his men; he may have been right in moral terms but it undermined his rule.
Â 
Was Dany right to crucify those slavers? Many long debates have been kicked back on this forum on just that issue. She may have been just as wrong to feel bad for having done it, and reverse her order to leave them nailed up as an example. Power is a curious thing. I guess the right or wrong of it on whether the slavers appreciate her turn towards mercy and will obey her, or whether they view it as weakness and see an opportunity to undermine her.
Â 

	Spoiler Book readers know the answer to this, even if the exact situation same situation did not occur in the books.

3989	Thelastactionhero	2014-05-16	Just curious, what scene in S2? I don't really remember liking much of her storyline in S2, in fact a lot of it was dreadful.


I like a lot of what goes on in the desert, but her final scene where she faces the House of the Undying is also really cool. Even though I'm not exactly excited to hear her screaming about HER dragons, at the very least, she shows her fallibility as a human being, something that was completely absent from season 3. I wish they had played up her conversation with Jorah about the ghosts people carry with them, because I thought that conversation in the books was easily one of the best pieces of dialogue George ever wrote. Even still, what's missing from her arc isn't stuff that makes Dany look like an evil tyrant, but rather scenes that show the consequences of her actions and her frailty as a young girl trying to control a great army.Â
3990	hollowcrown	2014-05-12	He's probably quite underappreciated compared to Dinklage's masterclass in this episode, but damn I thought he was brilliant.
Â 
His whole transformation and portrayal of Jaime's character is just perfect. Here's a guy who truly loves his brother and his increasing distance from Cersei and Tywin as he sees them betraying and sentencing Tyrion to death. He sells out his vows again for his family and the moment where he told Tywin that he slew Aerys for him was touching but not really what Tywin deserves at
Â 
The way he portrays Jaime with just looks and posture is amzing. Look back to season 1 and 2 - Jaime, even when captured, is full of arrogance and swagger. Now he's back in KL you can see Jaime is trying to puff himself up but remains really deflated and downcast. He's not the same bright eyed arrogant pretty boy from Season 1, but someone who has become more vulnerable and aware of the horrors of the world after his handen The way he places his left hand by his sword when he's feeling uneasy and uncomfortable during Tyrion's trial encompasses this.
Â 
Yes Dinklage was brilliant and should win awards, but here's to Nikolaj's amazing performance as a much more introverted character to contrast to Tyrion's louder part.
3991	Lady of Dragonstone	2014-05-12	I completely agree. He practically is Jaime. At the beginning of the show he was Cersei's creature in whole. Throughout season two we see him arrogantly curious about his companion, Brienne. In the book we can see that he does care about her (in whatever way) , and I think they really did a great job on the progression of their (non?) relationship, from enemies to trusted friends. And while that is happening, Jaime's heart is hardening towards Cersei - now in season four we have him sending Brienne on a mission to save Sansa, trying to save Tyrion, and promising Tywin he will give up the white cloak and marry - all against Cersei's wishes.
Â 
His personality is spot on in portrayal. I loved his sarcasm in the books and it is no different on screen. Nikolaj is dry and ironic in the perfect Jaime way, but it seems like he has toned down a bit in this season, somewhat humbled by his injury.
3992	Lord Damian	2014-05-12	I think he is clearly the breakout movie star from this series, his is going to be an A list actor within 5 years. Thanks to AGOT and is looks. He ought to have his agent pursue to be the next James Bond Villain or something.
I do wish his and Tyrion's hair was bleach blond since they atleast go to the trouble for Cersei and Dany's hair to match the books. It is the hair overall that is the slap in our face give away on the incest bastardy.

3993	I'll pay the iron price	2014-05-13	Agree, the guy plays a great part
3994	Stannis Eats No Peaches	2014-05-13	He does a really good job. His bath scene last season was amazing and the "oh shit" face he pulls when Tywin says "done" was one of my favourite bits of this episode.
3995	Angielina	2014-05-13	Absolutely agree with all the above posts. Nikolaj has shown some amazing work in his portrayal of a diamond of a character, and how different "light" pulls out these aspects. The more you look the more complex and fascinating this character becomes. To see Nikolaj's interpretation of how Jaime has progressed into his own identity and less a "Lannister" has been inspiring.
Â 
Jaime's awareness of his depth has increased substantially since his time with Brienne, and how he is willing to go into the "bear pit" with Tyrion also was heartwarming. It is quite ironic when he comes to Tywin with his willingness to leave the Kingsguard and "maintain the Lannister line" by living an ordinary life in exchange for Tyrion's life- as Jaime actually has become less Lannistery. This performance was artful on Nikolaj's part.
And imo, there is no better match that I have seen on TV or movies today then the on screen interaction that NIkolaj and Gwen share. I hope that we can see them together on screen again when Game of Thrones ends.
I am hoping the Academy will recognize Nikolaj's hard work this year with an Emmy; since Dinklage has already one. The difference I see between Peter and Nikolaj is the Peter is dramatic and commands the stage; Nikolaj is poignant, subtle, and a softer catalyst to those around him.

3997	SeventySeven	2014-05-13	Nikolaj is quite something, but I've been blowing hot and cold with Jaime this season. Even if I completely ignore the fuck up of episode 3, I feel that Jaime's characterisation is a bit all over the place this season. I liked his scenes in this episode and the last scene he had with Brienne was lovely, but there's something off about him which I can't quite pinpoint.
Â 
Basically it's what happened with Jon for 3 seasons as well, where the more I watched of him the more I was wondering who was this dude they called Jon Snow, I just didn't connect the way I connect with him in the books (it's better this season though!). I loved what they did with Jaime last season, I hope the writing picks up because NCW can be way better than what we've see of him this season.
3998	I'll pay the iron price	2014-05-13	Watch "Nightwatch"Â 
Â 
http://en.wikipedia....tch_(1994_film)
Â 
Its 20 years old but stars a young Nikolaj as well as Kim Bodnia (Frank from "The Pusher")
Â 
Pretty good movie
3999	The Taxman	2014-05-13	Love how caring he is of Tyrion.
4000	Hangover of the Morning	2014-05-13	Nikolaj was absolutely fabulous in this episode. I don't think that the trials scenes would be half as potent without his reaction shots. Also his plea for Tyrion's life was truly touching even if Tywin obviously outsmarted him in that scene.
Â 
Jaime is the only person in the whole rooms that cares about Tyrion so in that way he represents us as the audience.Â
4001	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-13	Some great pieces of acting throughout the episode. His reaction when Tyrion started speaking up was heartbreaking.Â
4002	direwoofwoof	2014-05-13	I remember reading the books after my boyfriend and he would comment, "You're going to like Jaime later on in the story" and I never belived him- until I finshed the books. How can you not admire the transformation Jamie goes through? The show is really nailing it and I find him getting more physically attractive as his personality becomes less offensive. That scene where he sends off Brienne was phenomenal and this episode where he attempts to intervene for Tyrian just solidifies his journey to good-guy-dom.

4003	Envie	2014-05-13	Nikolaj has very subtle acting abilities. I think he's really good and underappreciated (except for his sexy looks) far too much on the show. Other characters like Tyrion get a lot more kudos because they're playing a very difficult character. Jaime's character (on the outside) seems very simple - big handsome knight who's had his whole life handed to him on a silver platter and is a great fighter but killed a king and now has a complex. It's not that simple though. Jaime's underlying character is pretty complicated and conflicted and I'm so glad we're finally seeing that this season with the Brienne, Cersei, Tywin and Tyrion scenes. That heartbreaking look he gave Tyrion when he realized Tyrion wasn't going to keep his mouth shut like he'd begged him to do was utterly to die for. I wanted to hug him!Â
4004	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-13	Jaime is the only one that loves Tyrion.  This was palpable throughout the episode.Â
4005	Pericles	2014-05-13	I think he is clearly the breakout movie star from this series, his is going to be an A list actor within 5 years. Thanks to AGOT and is looks. He ought to have his agent pursue to be the next James Bond Villain or something.

Â 
Jaime's hair was bleech blond, as I recall. I think the dark toners, along with the other changes, are evidence of his moral changes.
4006	MoA«t	2014-05-14	Love NCW. Brilliant.
4007	Bear Island	2014-05-14	Nikolaj is brilliant. He is consistently excellent in every single scene he's in, even when he's not featured. He is one of the show's absolute best, I cannot fault him. Since the last season, he's become my favourite actor on the show simply because he is so damn good.
4008	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-14	The beauty of this scene is how much is NCW able to portray and let us know by just subtle acting. Unfortunately, that doesn't win awards.
Â 
First, when he takes Tyrion to the court, someone screams "Kingslayer". that's what Jaime has been hearing for the past 16 years. I think they wants us to see how Jaime is finally able to see himself, or rather see Tyrion, in the same situation he has been living his whole life, for the first time. When Tyrion starts his final speech about how he wished to have let everybody died, Jaime knows that feeling because he also saved the city once, and people only remembers that he broke his vows and killed Aerys. When Tyrion says he's in trial for being a dwarf, Jaime can understand that: he knows his father and sister aren't able to see beyond the "imp", while he actually loves Tyrion because Tyrion is his brother. He knows Tyrion isn't lying: he is been judged for being a dwarf in the same way everybody judge him for being a Kinslayer without knowing that killing the King saved the city.
4009	Gregor's Nancy Boy	2014-05-14	I always enjoy when he gets screen time. Just watching his reactions to things in the background is great. But honestly, I don't know why everyone thinks Peter Dinklage is such a great actor. I like him as a person and he does a decent enough job as Tyrion but that fake accent of his is too much. Every time he has to do an emotional scene, it becomes unbearable.Â
4010	Petyr Patter	2014-05-15	Watch "Nightwatch"Â

Â 
I also just realized he played the main character in a short lived sci-fi/historical/detective mash up New Amsterdam.Â  I remember watching in on Hulu, but apparently it has been removed.Â  However, I did find a trailer first put up in 2008: https://www.youtube....h?v=uUd2BEIy_QQ .
Â 
He apparently plays a very different character with a very similar style.Â  Still, find him the right role and he can shine.

4012	Belisarius09	2014-05-15	I think NCW is one of the best actors in this series.Â  Yes Peter Dinklage is great, but people tend to overlook everyone else that portrays their characters so convincingly.
Â 
In my book, NCW, Stephen Dillaine, Charles Dance, Ian Glenn, Peter Dinklage, Liam Cunningham, Aiden Gillen, and Conleth Hill are the best actors in this series.Â 
Â 
Oh and Sean Bean too.Â  Also a shout out to Robert Baratheon's actor.Â  He did a great job too.
4013	Secu86	2014-05-15	Altough I am man, I like his character and he became one of my favourites, mainly becuase he realizes that looks and money doesn't give you all.Â 
After his break-up with Cersei, we got the chance to see his good side and I think this is him.Â 
I would like him become a swordsman as good as before his hand was cut-off.Â 
Â 
In my opinion,Â Conleth Hill it's in top 3 of the best actors in the show. The tone and pitch of his voice, his mimic are that good you might say it's a master of NLP.Â
4014	stannisismyking	2014-05-15	I agree with several posters above, Jaime's reaction shots in the background are so important, the way he's observing the different family members and trying to process what's unfolding in front of him.
I much preferred this episode's scene with Tywin to the one in 4.01.Â  I loved Jaime stepping up for his little brother and then the look on his face when he realises he's been played by Tywin.
4015	KeeperOfOaths	2014-05-15	I totally agree. Nikolaj is GREAT! He was perfect in the last episode.. Apart from the moments you have mentioned, his eyes during that scene where he takes Tyrion out of prison to go to the court room. His eyes expressed so much pain and sadness. I don't even want to imagine his face in episode 10. Oh, the feels!!!
4016	NOT A TARG I SWEAR	2014-05-15	Jaime is the only one that loves Tyrion.  This was palpable throughout the episode.Â 


One of my favorite scenes of this season was the Jamie/Bronn sparring scene when Bronn describes the trial at the Eyrie and you can just see the switch flip on in Jamie that he needs to actively help Tyrion. Just one of many examples of him acting perfectly without words.

4017	JagLover	2014-05-15	Yes he is great, to the extent where I would often rate an episode with him given allot of screentime (like Oathkeeper or this one) higher than others.
Â 
It is usually subtle acting with his facial expressions and mannerisms. Deserves a best supporting actor nomination certainly.
Â 
There are a number of others I would consider equal to, or better than Dinklage as well.
4018	7th-key	2014-05-15	He made me love Jaime since the the scene in with Cat in the pen. The "So many oaths" speech. He conveyed arrogance, pragmatism and "you've already judged me anyway" all at the same time.
Â 
And count me in on the Conleth Hill appreciation train.

4020	1000AcresAndAHoldfast	2014-05-15	I agree, IMO a few of the actors have slipped a bit in this season so far perhaps with one eye on future Hollywood roles but NCW is one of the few who keeps raising his game.Â
4021	Ser Blake	2014-05-15	I agree that NCW is doing a great job.Â  Now, I'm simultaneously looking forward to and dreading (if it's shown) Jaime's and Tyrion's "falling out" in the tunnels during Tyrion's escape.Â  That's going to be heart wrenching and so, so good Â Â Â 


Â 
The prison break scene is going to crush me. Â It was heart breaking reading it in the books and it will probably be even more painful with the brilliant acting of Dinklage and NCW. Â

4023	Volverin	2014-05-15	I just don't see how are they going to make Tyrion turn against Jaime. They have great relations right now, he even tried helping him at the trial. Then he will rescue him and Tyrion will turn against him just like that? Unsullied definitely don't remember the Tysha story that was only brought up ONCE in 4 seasons, not sure how are they going to do it.
Â 
I think this is one of the subjects D&D discussed with GRRM. They definitely asked him if the Tyrion turning against Jaime will be important to the story later, you know as in if there will be situation in which they confront each other again in the future and it will matter.
Â 
If it won't matter I think they might just change it from the book version and make Jaime and Tyrion have a great and peaceful goodbye scene because what could be the reason for the ShowTyrion to get angry at Jaime?

Â 
They will do it just as it was in the books. Not until Tyrion confronts his father does the real truth come out about the Tysha incident. That's when Tyrion will finally lose the last shred of sanity and turn against everyone, including his brother.
Â 
What reason does Show Tyrion have? He's been betrayed by everyone - even his brother lied about Tysha. His lover lied and betrayed him and is found in his Father's bed, his Sister wants him dead, he's been framed for a murder he didn't do and his Father willingly let him be tried and found guilty despite his smarter instincts likely knowing the truth of it that Tyrion didn't do it. Tyrion loses the trial by combat and is sentenced to be executed. What else does he have to lose at this point?
4025	Drogon's Personal Trainer	2014-05-15	Yes he is great, to the extent where I would often rate an episode with him given allot of screentime (like Oathkeeper or this one) higher than others.

Agreed. Â The first golden rule of good acting is to underplay, and NCW does it beautifully. Â When Dink underplays he is, IMHO, much better than when he has to do deep emotions, but each to his own. Â I love him too, I just prefer NCW. Â Even since season 1, NCW has shown that Jaime is perhaps the single most complex character in the whole saga. Â He's doing a fantastic job.
4026	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-15	Acting is reacting and he reacts perfectly to everything around him.
4027	Currawong	2014-05-16	Nikolaj is quite something, but I've been blowing hot and cold with Jaime this season. Even if I completely ignore the fuck up of episode 3, I feel that Jaime's characterisation is a bit all over the place this season. I liked his scenes in this episode and the last scene he had with Brienne was lovely, but there's something off about him which I can't quite pinpoint.


Don't forget that his character is supposed to be a bit all over the place, because Jaime is extremely conflicted when he returns to KL.Â Â  After all he has been through in S2 and S3, think about what he is faced with - he loves Cersei, he loves Tyrion, he may not love his father but he has been brought up to respect and honour him.Â  He doesn't want a rift with anyone in his family.Â Â  Yet his sister and father hate Tyrion, and the time he has spent with Brienne has changed him in ways he can't yet properly fathom.Â Â  Jaime Lannister now doesn't really know 'who' he is, just like in the books.
Â 
I agree with others - right from the start NCW has always played Jaime superbly, and he seems to completely 'get' his character. Â  His tendency to underplay, and say so much through his eyes and subtle body language, is one of his greatest strengths.Â  That's one reason his scenes with Brienne are so powerful, because Gwendoline Christie is also someone who can say a lot by doing very little.Â Â  In their two goodbye scenes, at Harrenhal in S3 and now in S4 Oathkeeper, it was what wasn't spoken that gave the scenes such power.Â Â  And yes, even when NCW is just there in a scene, in the background and not actually doing anything, you somehow always notice him. Â  I am really looking forward to seeing future Jaime scenes, especially the rift with Tyrion and also the total breakdown of his relationship with Cersei. Â  Whatever Jaime's personal 'journey' is in the rest of the series, you know that NCW will do it full justice.

I think this is one of the subjects D&D discussed with GRRM. They definitely asked him if the Tyrion turning against Jaime will be important to the story later, you know as in if there will be situation in which they confront each other again in the future and it will matter.
Â 
If it won't matter I think they might just change it from the book version and make Jaime and Tyrion have a great and peaceful goodbye scene because what could be the reason for the ShowTyrion to get angry at Jaime?


Yes, this is something I'm afraid may very well happen - they'll just leave out that wonderful scene where Jaime reveals the truth of Tysha's love for Tyrion and the incredibly hurt Tyrion lashesÂ back at Jaime by lying to him that he really did kill Joffrey.Â  In the show they could just have Jaime and Tyrion have a nice farewell, as you say, and then still have Tyrion go kill Tywin and Shae.Â  I sincerely hope this doesn't happen but it won't surprise me if it does.Â
4032	David Selig	2014-05-16	He's been sensational throughout. Always spot on with his acting.
4033	Gabriel Belmont the Dragon	2014-05-16	indeed loved his expression during the scene where tywin accpeted his deal with Tyrion fast it said "My own father played me"
4034	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-05-11	He has more men (4000 against 1500), more ships, and now actual chests of gold before going to the wall.... how will this change  his relationship with Jon and his later northener campaign?
He is a stronger player way before we ve seen in the books. 
And, are we now supposed to believe Massey wont betray him.in the books and that he is going to reach a stronger position than what he has now?
Or will they skip his later northen support to leave him just the same.

4035	Lord Damian	2014-05-12	Stannis will still be rejected. Remember, the Iron Bank will stay with Tywin, when he dies, the go to meet Cersei to "measure her up" and to see if she will be reliable. That is when they go to Stannis. Stannis will end up at the wall this season because he cannot stay at Dragonston or Storm's End. He has no where else to go and must do something Kingly before he is forgotten.

Â 
The show has let us known time and time again that the Battle of the Blackwater did a number on the Baratheon army, I think this money + more ships and a bigger army is to make his presence in the north feel as if it has more weight behind it. I like that, as a Stannis man.
4037	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-05-12	I guess it could maybe have repercussions much later. Like, I assume that while they were in Braavos they hired some sellswords to take to the Wall, as Davos suggested in an early episode (about the sellswords, not the Wall part)
Â 
So I think maybe later there won't be any reason for Massey to go back to Essos. If Massey even makes the cut, that is

4038	TheNorth's1stKnight	2014-05-13	i still think we'll see some of the same interactions between stannis and jon at the wall. (stannis offering him winterfell and jon giving him advice on how to rally the northerners)
4039	Batman	2014-05-13	It sort of takes away the resolve and ingenuity that I loved to see from Stannis so much. The fact that not matter how bad things got he would keep coming after you. Giving him more men, more ships and the support of the Iron Bank so early means that he does not have to struggle so long or so hard. The guy was like the Terminator, there was no hint of relent in Stannis Baratheon. They have not written him well, so thank god for Stephen Dilane actually putting in quality performance.
4040	Mad Monkey	2014-05-13	Stannis might start to become a little more flamboyant. Perhaps by purchasing a gilded, jewel=encrusted sword with a naked woman carved on its hilt, or obtaining lots of purple hair dye from Lys.
4041	SheRa Seastar	2014-05-13	We don't know how much the Iron bank lent him, it could well have been just a couple of bits of gold, enough to get salador saan involved again
4042	The Drunkard	2014-05-13	Well, I suppose he can immediately garrison, repair and resupply all the castles at the Wall, but that would diminish the need to have the NW, wildlings and southerners all working together, which was an important realization for Stannis and Jon.Â The weirdest part for me is his four thousand men. That's more than triple the men he has in the books, and I think a fair bit more than Roose has according to the show. So that lessens the desperation of his current position, as well as his future need to appeal to the northerners rather than just demand their service.Â 
Â 
I hope he still visits the mountain clans, or some miscellaneous northern castle/s.
4043	titanx5	2014-05-13	He has more men (4000 against 1500), more ships, and now actual chests of gold before going to the wall.... how will this change his relationship with Jon and his later northener campaign?

Â 
1) I dont know where you presume Massey is going to betray Stannis, Its not Massey's gold its the IB and sorry I dont think anyone wants to screw over the IB and put a target on their back. Not everyone just suddenly betrays someone just because they are ambitious, but this discussion has been mentioned tons of times before
Â 
2) We dont know how much gold the IB gave Stannis, I was surprised that he said 4000 men, I thought he had virtually nothing of how they played it in the show. However lets say he gets another 4000 men. Thats 8000 men against 100 000 Wildlings, thats still an impressive victory regardless.
Â 
3) In terms of the Northern support I think they will all support him and go straight for WF. He will probably loose a lot of men in the snow stormsÂ
4044	Epyon	2014-05-13	I'm not there in the books yet, but does 1500 include the men he takes to the wall AND the forces he'd still have at Dragonstone? As I recall, someone would have to be there to dump oil on Loras (though admittedly leaving more than half your men behind would be ...strange...)
4045	ovis alba	2014-05-13	I'm not sure if it changes much or if it does I'm not sure I mind (depends how it plays out).
I think it actually nicely sets up a moment of surprise as people can assume that he would probably have the forces to attack King's Landing again. So his decision to go to the wall doesn't come of as "he had no other choice anyhow" but as a deliberatly made decision against King's Landing and for the wall.
4046	MidnightKiss	2014-05-13	I found it really odd that the Iron Bank gave Stannis gold when they were already supporting the current king on the Iron Throne. So they've lent money to both sides? And the only reason given is that Tywin is a bit old?
Â 
Even though he's healthy and could easily last for many years guiding Tommen until he's a strong ruler. There is already a good alliance with Highgarden and their gold, some of which can be used to pay the Iron Bank.Â 
Â 
Why start a new war?

It's heavily implied that the crown has owed the Iron Bank money for years and they haven't seen any money yet. So now they're backing Stannis, under the condition that once he attains power he will pay back both loans.
4048	Gneisenau	2014-05-13	Correct me if I am wrong, but perhaps the IB only gave Stannis a small loan, I think Davos gave Saan silver coins ?
4049	MidnightKiss	2014-05-13	So now they're backing Stannis, under the condition that once he attains power he will pay back both loans.
Â 

Â 
I realise this from the books/sample chapters but I didn't get any of that from the episode.
Â 
Also, although the crown doesn't have any money, the Iron Bank would surely realise that with Highgarden marrying into the throne they would bring gold with them? Why wouldn't the Iron Bank simply say to the crown, "start paying us when you get your Highgarden gold or we'll back Stannis"?
4050	Lord Thornhart	2014-05-13	And, are we now supposed to believe Massey wont betray him.in the books and that he is going to reach a stronger position than what he has now?

Â 
we dont know that..Â 
Â 
We know they gave him one chest which was ised to pay Salladhor.
Â 
The IB Â has given Stannis some money but I doubt they've given him the vast credit Â he requires or will get once Â Cersei mucks things up.

Â 
He leaves a garrison both at Dragonstone and at Storm's End, but the rest all follow to the Wall IIRC. I think those don't count as the ones who fight the Wildlings.

Â 
Stannis had at that time 1,600 men total. A strong garrison of 300 at Storm's End, a token force on Dragonstone, and slightly less than 1,300 men go with him to the Wall.
4054	Widows_Blood	2014-05-13	It gives him some extra money to keep Saan's support, maybe buy some ships, but thats about it. He still has no support among the noble families of Westeros and a paltry fighting force compared to other major players. His story still remains the same even if he has a couple thousand extra soldiers.Â
4055	Bronn Urgundy	2014-05-13	Stannis might start to become a little more flamboyant. Perhaps by purchasing a gilded, jewel=encrusted sword with a naked woman carved on its hilt, or obtaining lots of purple hair dye from Lys.

4056	Guard of the Rainking	2014-05-13	He might take bigger casualties at the Wall though. HBO viewers guide and Inside episode seem to confirm that Stannis got money from the Iron Bank. It might have just been a token of trust and a possible future relationship. Something along the lines of: "If the Lannisters refuse to pay we'll give you all the gold you need. As a token of friendship take this chest."
4057	Stormland's Fury	2014-05-13	Â 
Next time he smiles he'll have a golden tooth, its part of his master plan to win Daenerys to his cause.


Â 
One might say he becomes a true flamer.
4058	madscientist	2014-05-13	Clarifying:
Â 
- Stannis claims to have 4000 men ( This might include squires, peasant militia, guards, free-riders, the men who maintain his 32-shipÂ fleet,Â Storm's End garrison, some of the Storm Lands, etc.)
Â 
- The Wildling army is approximately 100000 strong (2.5 times bigger than in the books)
Â 
- If the Wildling army is larger by 2.5 compared to the books, then Stannis's cavalry should also be upgraded accordingly. (1500*2.5 = 3750)
Â 
- Note that 4000 - 3750 = 250 (Enough to defend Dragonstone)
Â 
Â 
Negotiation analysis:
Â 
The show has not revealed how much gold the Iron Bank is providing Stannis or the details of the negotiation. Do you really think that a bank is just going to lend any rebel Lord money just because his advisor believes he is a good leader ?Â 
Â 
Remember the letter that Stannis receives at the end of Season 3? In the books, the Iron Bank is well aware of the White Walker threat, although it is not explained how. Several winters have passed since the Iron Bank started lending the Westerosi crown gold, and Westeros has not been invaded by the undead. So, I assume that ,Â on the show, Stannis told Nestoris about the letter and also that Tywin Lannister is not moving a finger to aid the Night's Watch. Probably, Nestoris decides to give Stannis enough gold to hire ships to travel north as fast as possibleÂ to ensure that Westeros is not eradicated ( If Westeros is invaded, no one is paying back).
Â 
Â 
Conclusion:
Â 
We will have to wait until episode 9 ( or 10) to find out exactly how things went down. But, if my analysis is correct, we will probably see Tycho Nestoris going to King's Landing to talk to Cersei next season ( as a last attempt to ask for repayment).
Â 
Â 
However:
Â 
If I am wrong, and the Iron Bank is trulyÂ supporting Stannis 100% , then we will probably see the following changes:
Â 
- No Mountain Clans.
Â 
- Stannis is much more of a threat to the South ( This makesÂ the storyÂ more interesting for a TV audience)
Â 
- Perhaps Davos's visit to Lord Manderly will not be needed, and the show will alter his storyline completely.
Â 
-The Roose/Stannis conflict will be solved much faster ( probably before the end of next season).
Â 
-Stannis will use his gold to repair the castles and help the Night's Watch (opposite to the books where he is in a desperate situation, and needs Jon Snow to feed his men).

Â 
So I think maybe later there won't be any reason for Massey to go back to Essos. If Massey even makes the cut, that is


Â 
One ramificationÂ about the early loan is that at lot of people speculating on how Arya ends up back in Westeros are going to have to change their theory.Â  Many thought Arya would hitch a ride back with Massey.Â  Now, we know that is not going to happen.Â

Â  This was also a thought...Â Since IB already made deal with Stannis before coming to the wall...

I dont think Massey will betray him. I was just adressing that it was a topic always discussed.
About the amount of the loan, we dont know just yet, but if it was a token loan, would they had expend it hiring a pirat and paying old debts? Whats the use of Saalador in a fight against wildings? He already does have 34 ships.

Â 
I remember in the book, Stannis had 2000 men and about 100 crows from East watch, they defeated ten thousands wildlings, killed 1000, and captured another 1000, considering Stannis has calvary, better armored and better armed, and the wilding were caught unawared, this victory, ghough impressive,did make sense

Â 
It is still possible, we do not know how much gold IB gave Stannis this time, I do not think IB has decided to abandoned Lanniser's cause, since Lannisters are their biggest investment, and until now at least, they did pay the money back. What IB did in the last episode was just what we call investment diversity, they may just gave Stannis enough gold to enable him to sail to the wall

Yes, in episode 10 last season, Davos shows him the scroll from Castle Black, Melisandre reads it and looks into the flames, realizes the Great Other is there, and tells Stannis that death is marching on the Wall, he is the only one who can stop it, and the War of Five Kings means nothing. Stannis decides he'll go, but needs to wait for Davos to raise enough men and ships.Â

Good point. While having more men makes his victory against the wildlings less impressive, it does make his decision to go to the wall more admirable and surprising. Considering Stannis could use some positive PR, so to speak, with unsullied viewers I think this could have some benefits.

Stannis got another urge to go claim his birthright after Joffrey died and at the Bank they talk about who is best fit to rule. So we're being pointed towards King's Landing before they pull a switch on us and he goes to the Wall. Perhaps to keep the element of surprise they won't give a solid reminder until he arrives.

Maybe a scene on a ship with Stannis and Davos talking about where they should head next. Stannis might argue that they should sail for King's Landing since winning the throne would give him more resources to fight the threat in the North. Davos could disagree, and would want to sail to the Wall right away. Then leave Stannis' choice as a cliffhanger. However for Stannis wanting to attack KL to make sense they need to have the Iron Bank's support, and if you read my earlier post you'll know how I would like the IB situation to go down.

Â Yeah, you're probably right.Â  Guess the show had to establish a reason for IB to be interested enough in Stannis to go to the wall to seek him out later.Â  That would make more sense.

Not in the books, but he does have his infamous saving the realm quote in the books. However in the show it would make even more sense, since in E3 he already pondered over attacking KL. Choosing the Wall over KL could be a fine addition IMO.
4076	Guard of the Rainking	2014-05-15	I just listened to the recent Game of Owns podcast and Bryan Cogman said that Stannis didn't get the full support of the IB.

Â 
Probably introduced them as players. By the time Stannis is at the Wall and successfully established a base and subdued the Wildlings, Tywin is probably dead and Cersei stopped the payments. Tycho (who the audience already knows at that point) shows then up on the Wall/Crofter's Village and says something like "Lord Stannis, it seems your business is required after all".

4082	ground_control	2014-05-16	IMO, Â this will not change anything.

1) Martin isn't very good with numbers, and he really hasn't given out many in the books (and has admitted that some numbers, like prize amounts in AGOT, don't make sense).
2) The show is even worse with numbers
Â 
So, whatever D&D wants to happen will happen, regardless of whether or not it makes sense with either Martin's numbers or their own previously established numbers.
Â 
And the number of extras etc. actually filmed will be much lower than any of the numbers actually discussed.

Edit: I don't mean to sound overly critical, I just mean that nothing really turns on the *accuracy* of the numbers, they're just used descriptively, so there's no need to think that the amount of money really means anything, or that getting it a bit early is going to make a difference to the plot.
Â 
The show wanted more Stannis/Davos time, so it put some focus on Stannis needing money and troops before he could go *anywhere* and then resolved it by introducing the bank a bit earlier (and differently) than in the books. Â Overall, I think that they pulled this off pretty well (at least compared to the much more obvious/clunky filler in the Crasterfck).

They didn't reject him, they gave him chests of gold.
Â 
Â 
The show has let us known time and time again that the Battle of the Blackwater did a number on the Baratheon army, I think this money + more ships and a bigger army is to make his presence in the north feel as if it has more weight behind it. I like that, as a Stannis man.you


you are right, after watching the replay, I had to leave the room when Davos entered the bath. Yeah, they kind of messed up the timing of support for Stannis but they may play it as we need to buy time to raise troops, Dragonstone not big enough and Storm's End is already encircled so maybe he has to go North to regroup. Money he has, manpower will take time and he has to go somewhere.

4160	ShaggyHound	2014-05-12	Speeches reigned supreme this episode. Tyrion, Asha and Davos all knocked it out of the park. Tywin was in a rare form during his conversation with Jaime and i love how nobody takes Mace serious. The rigged confessions of Pycelle and Trant were well written too. Same with Shae but unfortunately she's just a horrible actress wich i can't look past. Best lines have all been mentioned already but still, this one belongs here too:
Â 
Oberyn: "You liked boys before...?"
Varys: * Shakes no*
Oberyn: "really?"
Â 
Aside from Shae mentioning she had to fuck Tyrion like it was his last night, it was the only time during the entire episode that Oberyn genuinly seemed to care about what was said. Man, that character is portrayed like a boss. I can only hope that next season, they really keep up with this level when they introduce more Dornish characters.
4161	Warhawk137	2014-05-12	Mace tyrell, be a good man and fetch my quill and parchment. Mace is the lord of Highgarden and Tywin made him a delivery boy.


Â 
The best part of that was Oberyn looking around at everyone as Mace gets up to get the quill & parchment, and it very much looks like Oberyn is thinking something along the lines of "seriously, the fuck is wrong with you people?"
4162	Lord Baalish	2014-05-12	Yeah, what the hell - does the show canon include him knowing now ?Â Â  
Â 


He always knew, he never acknowledged knowing it.Â
4163	Starkfyre Barathyrell	2014-05-12	did you do it?

The best part of that was Oberyn looking around at everyone as Mace gets up to get the quill & parchment, and it very much looks like Oberyn is thinking something along the lines of "seriously, the fuck is wrong with you people?"


Â 
My favorite part of that was the sheer pomposity with which Mace went to get the quill and parchment. Â Like he was just awarded the greatest honor in the whole 7K.
4165	Orlando Vargas	2014-05-12	I loved tyrians speech. I believe it stole the show.
4166	Ingelheim	2014-05-12	One of the best written episodes ever. Tyrion was brilliant like he's never been since a lot of time.

It certainly did. Because of its delivery.
4168	Tanith	2014-05-12	did you do it?

Not to take away from Peter Dinklage, but that's one of my favorite exchanges during the whole trial scene. Oberyn is one of the few who doesn't get an "Oh, shit!" expression when Tyrion demands his trial by combat.
4169	Arkash	2014-05-12	Not a line but the side-eye of Barristan when Dany said she would repay the goat-herder three times was gold !

4170	Janicia	2014-05-12	Not a line but the side-eye of Barristan when Dany said she would repay the goat-herder three times was gold !


Yeah, he really wanted to tell her that was a bad idea.
4171	BlackTalon	2014-05-12	She will have every sheepherder around Meereen burning up his sheep and hauling the carcasses before her ...
4172	The Amethyst Empress	2014-05-12	"Lord Tyrell be a good man and fetch me some quill and paper"
I love you Tywin Â  Â
4173	Corvinus	2014-05-12	Tywin: "Should we blame the bakers?"
Tyrion: "Or the pigeons, just leave me out of it."
Â 
Tyrion's speech at the end.
Â 
Tywin's, and I am paraphrasing, "How much to pay the common soldier who wants to try his luck with the Hound?"

Â 
"I lost my accent years ago."

4177	Batman	2014-05-12	I should have let stannis kill you all.


Â 
Boo Yah!
4178	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-05-12	Yeah, he really wanted to tell her that was a bad idea.


Â I sensed that he was more just a bit surprised by her generosity, but that he actually approved. He was smiling a couple seconds later when the goat herder was thanking them.
4179	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-05-12	Â 
My favorite part of that was the sheer pomposity with which Mace went to get the quill and parchment. Â Like he was just awarded the greatest honor in the whole 7K.


Â Yeah, that part made me smile. I imagine there are a lot of subtle things like that that I missed. I'm sure i'll be watching the episode again this week...
4180	Alizard Erebys	2014-05-12	"Watching your vicious bastardÂ die gave me more relief than 1000 lying whores".
Â 
That's the one for me.
Â 
I also quite liked when Oberyn asked Cersei "what debt?" during her testimony. This guy is not missing any detail. Sharp mind, sharp mouth, I like him more with each episode.
4181	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-05-12	The sheer ludicrousness of Pycelle's "Most noble child every put on this earth" had be LOL'ing. Like there's no way anybody could believe that but the way he delivers it with such seriousness and anger that it's not even clear if he's lying or truly believes it.
4182	Warhawk137	2014-05-12	I loved tyrians speech. I believe it stole the show.


Â 
Fun fact, 17 extras were knocked unconscious during the filming of that scene by the sheer force of Tyrion's jawline.
4183	Rhaquentis	2014-05-12	Come on, Tyrion's whole speech, and there's no contest.
4184	Oberyion Martennister	2014-05-12	Not a line but the fact that Oberyn sat slouched with the "uhuh" face while everyone else stood up for Tywin was GOLD
4185	iliasb	2014-05-12	Tyrion: Have you forgotten, Lord Varys?
Â 
Varys: Sadly my lord, I never forget a thing.


Â 
I think I didn't entirely understand that one? Someone cares to explain?Â
4186	iliasb	2014-05-12	Oberyn is one of the few who doesn't get an "Oh, shit!" expression when Tyrion demands his trial by combat.


Â 
Because he knows what comes next.... (sorry for double post)

4187	Rhaquentis	2014-05-12	Â

It was meant to be ambiguous, I think. Either Varys remembers every little detail of what Tyrion has said about Joffrey etc. so "sadly" he has to use it against him, or he means that he does not forget what Tyrion has done for them and might help him behind the scenes. I guess it's the latter.
4188	eish2306	2014-05-12	"You are from Essos.Â  Lys?Â  You have the accent.Â  I have an ear for it."
Â 
"I lost my accent years ago."
Â 
"I have an ear for that, too."

So the backstory he claims is not true?
4189	PhoenixFlame	2014-05-12	So the backstory he claims is not true?


Â 
I assumed Oberyn could tell his accent wasn't native Westerosi and guessed Lys. Like, some kids who have diplomat parents and live in various places don't retain their native accent but it's not specific to a place either.Â
4190	~No One~	2014-05-12	I think I didn't entirely understand that one? Someone cares to explain?Â  

Besides the above poster's explanation, I took this as a bit of a double entendre to mean that he remembers what happened years ago....to the Targs and Blackfyres, for example
4191	Dildo_Baggins	2014-05-12	I was particularly fond of:
"I've spent some time in Essos, and the Unsullied are very impressive on the battlefield. Not so much in the bedroom"
Â 


Â The Oberyn Bi references is overdone
4192	Warhawk137	2014-05-12	Â The Oberyn Bi references is overdone


Â 
That was more of a joke anyway.
4193	JaimeTheBoy	2014-05-12	Loved how quickly Tywin agreed with Jaime over Tyrion.
Â 
Also loved Cersei 's line about Joffrey wanting to boost the morale of troops by fighting at the front, Tyrions facial reaction to this was perfect
4194	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-12	"I did not do it. I did not kill Joffrey but I wish that I had. Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than 1000 lying whores. I wish I was the monster you think I am. I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you. I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it".
Chills.https://www.youtube....h?v=YFROZkA-EWg


  Â I think I've watched that clip like 5 times already. Brilliant scene.Â
4195	Jasta11	2014-05-12	Varys: ''No one in under any obligation to call me Lord.''
Â 
Oberyn: ''Yet everyone does.''
Â 
Varys: *knowing shrug*
Â 
I think this is one of my favorite bits of new dialog in the entire show. It perfectly captures what Varys says to Tyrion about the illusory nature of power. No matter what Varys actually is, people think he's important, so he's called Lord Varys.
Â 
Also, ''Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than a thousand lying whores!'' for the sheer venom in the delivery.
4196	Pod The Impaler	2014-05-12	Â 
My favorite part of that was the sheer pomposity with which Mace went to get the quill and parchment. Â Like he was just awarded the greatest honor in the whole 7K.


Â 
Â 
This actually can be used to explain Pycelle's over-the-top praise about Joffrey. Secret jealousy of Mace Tyrell - Pycelle is supposed to be the parchment fetching guy and fears being put aside.Â Â 
j/k
4197	Widows_Blood	2014-05-12	Â 
That was more of a joke anyway.


Yeah I think it was a joke at the expense of their lack of endowment rather than a comment on trying to sleep with them.Â 
Â 
I really enjoyed Davos monologue about Stannis and pretty much everything that happened in kings landing.Â
4198	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-05-12	Â The Oberyn Bi references is overdone


Â I don't think it was as much a bi reference as just a jab at the unsullied for being castrated.
4199	direwoofwoof	2014-05-12	"As long as Stannis lives the war is NOT over." - Ser Davos Seaworth aka best wingman ever.Â  


Â 
Yes! Ser Davos in this scene and the reveal of his nubs.
4200	Miss Carnahan	2014-05-12	I should have let stannis kill you all.


Â 
+ of course: "I'm guilty of being a dwarf."
4201	Cubarey	2014-05-12	Possibly the best written episode of the series; at least as dialogue goes.
Â 
Tyrian's monologue at the end was amazingly good. I have a soft spot for the Iron Bankers acounting "beans" speech it is so realistic and true to life. Others may be concerned with "Right" and Titles but bankers care about getting paid.
Â 
Â 
Yara's speech was great but was undercut by the Ironmen Â "beaming up" when the dogs were loosed (just like the Ironmen they talk a big game but do not have the balls when it becomes real.
4202	Lord Damian	2014-05-12	"More than any man living."
"I should have let Stannis kill you all."
"Sadly, I never forget a thing."


Yeah, more than any man. I thought of hah hah, Dany is a girl.
4203	Wsaharan	2014-05-12	The way Tyrion says "oh you think so" when his brother points out that he is to be found guilty.

Â 
Â 

Ilove this the most, He said it, Your Bastard. He is telling her and everyone there the truth. It is too bad in the books he never spilled it out before everyone and his father. I so wanted him to say, Stannis is your true King, I protected the lie for my family, for my father and they are trying to kill me for it. Something like that. This quote above was a gift last night.
4206	Trillian	2014-05-12	My boyfriend has never watched the show, besides the odd bits when I am in front of the tv, and never showed any interest. 
He was around when Oberyn said "and did you do it?" to Shae, he laughed his ass off and he decided to watch the pilot tomorrow.  
So yeah, that.

Aye, every goatherder in Essos will be at her door claiming the dragons killed their sheep.  
Dunno about Saan's brown trousers, but that goatherder kid certainly needed them!
4208	NymTargaryen	2014-05-12	I loved the countless titles that everyone had to stress. First Davos listing Stannis' titles, then Dany (was it in High Valyrian?) and then Tommen. It adds a certain absurdity to the whole concept of power, which is emphasized by Varys' line about how he is no Lord and even mocked when Oberyn asks on the small council if he now has any titles.
4209	JDNight	2014-05-12	Â 
Â 
Varys, talking of Sandor: Â "I believe the words 'Fuck the King' were used."


Â 
Even when the Hound is not in the episode, he still gets involved in great lines!
Â 
EDIT:Â  Almost forgot Tywin's line about the gold for the common soldier.Â Â  How many common soldiers does it take to take down a Clegane?

the conversation between Jaime and Tywin. Tywin is one of my fav characters and in this conversation he showed the ruthless manipulator that he is


But his body language was perfect. It was like "I am gonna fetch the HELL out of that quill and parchment."

I mean the way he was seated in the Small Council as if no giving a fuck about anything.. So sad we won't get to see more of himÂ  
Â 
Can't forget the look Ser Jorah gives Daenerys when they say there is something like 200 more waiting and I was just thinking: and they are going to stand up the whole bloody 200 of them? That must certainly be tiresome!Â 
Â 
Also Asha/Yara: "My brother is dead"

I know it's wrong and I have no idea why it tickled me so, but there it is.
4235	Pericles	2014-05-15	The Bankers line about "I'm not a lord" really struck me for some reason. Stannis and Davo's accounted someone who didn't give a shit about feudal nonsense, only the reality of numbers, of objective fact.

But I think I'll keep the: "Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than a thousand lying whores..."
In the end, I just hate Joffrey and all the hypocrites bootlickers who are now supporting him. And I hate Shae. All this time Tyrion had to hold this opinion to himself for his own good, now he could shove it in everyone's faces and he did it so classy...

Â I agree. In that one short line, "I'm not a lord", he was basically exposing much of the ridiculousness that is Westeros. Good catch.
4240	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-15	Â I agree. In that one short line, "I'm not a lord", he was basically exposing much of the ridiculousness that is Westeros. Good catch.


Â 
Oberyn did the same when he says "so, I am a Master of whatever now?", like "ok, let's play the ridiculous name game here". Obviously, ridiculous Mace immediately states he's Master of Ships.

Â True. I actually missed that line, but I'll try to catch it the second time around lol. I think the ridiculousness of Westeros, which is comparatively easy for us to see, mirrors much of the ridiculousness in our own world, which we are often so reluctant to spot. Organized religion, politics, and countless other gems of b.s. A show like this can teach us much.
4242	Lord Jennings	2014-05-12	Theon has never been a favorite character of mine but I can't help but applaud Alfie Allen's effort in his transformation to Reek. I thought this episode helped cement that. What do you think?
Â 
Also, IÂ found myself rootingÂ for the ironborn and AshaÂ (which doesnt happen) on their quest to free Theon.I thought the show down in the kennels was entertaining. I did not think the deviation from the books here was all that bad and I thought Ramsay really showed his madness in this scene.
4243	The 10th Penny King	2014-05-12	Totally agree. Â The Reek transformation is outstanding and note perfect IMO. Â Reek and Ramsey's scenes this season are just as I envisioned them in the books. Â I think the entire scene in the kennels (although pointless at the moment) will set up the entire Ironborn fight for the seastone chair to come.
4244	MyLittleFinger	2014-05-12	Of all the young actors they plucked at the beginning, Alfie has proven to be the best and the brightest, even ahead of Jack Gleason imo. His range has been nuts, and fuck if he didn't nail the Yarasha-Dreadfort heel turn. Heartbreaking, especially when he fought tooth and nail to get away from her. Visceral.Â
4245	King Tyrion I	2014-05-12	He does a great job, surely.
4246	Florina Laufeyson	2014-05-12	Alfie 
He rocked my casbah in full Reek mode. It was actually really hard to watch and his wimpering and stammering...wow. And his "REEK REEK! I AM REEK!" i just...damn dude.Â Damn.
4247	WTFSalami	2014-05-12	Alfie IS Reek. Man, he's so good. I hope he gets some Emmy consideration.
4248	RoamingRonin	2014-05-12	Yeah. I feel bad for the guy. TV-Theon is a lot more sympathetic than Book-Theon. I forgot he butchered Ser Rodrick for a moment. I think it's the constant sexual abuse that's got me feeling bad for him. I turned my head for a second when Ramsay had his sex scene and I thought he was doing Theon.Â  
Â 
I was shocked when I was rooting for Asha/Yara, too. Mostly because I love it when actors do their own fight scenes. It's so lulzy . The scene might have been pointless, not in the books and oh no Ramsay wasn't wearing boiled leather!... but it was good TV. I like Yara so far. Hope the show keeps me rooting for her and Theon.Â
4249	StrollofShame	2014-05-12	My heart broke when watching Theon react to the bath...his horror over the washcloth & what he feared Ramsay meant to do with it...the poor guy flinching and cringing.. it was sad, & oh so GOOD. I am sure I was not nearly so sorry for Theon in the books.
4250	PhoenixFlame	2014-05-12	GAH MY HEART! Yes, Alfie Allen is amazing. I love the chemistry he has with Iwan Rheon too; even the director commented on it. It's awesome how utterly wracked with fear broken he can be. The bath scene...daaaayum. Poor bb kraken was so terrified I flinched when Ramsay wiped his back.Â

Man it must be fun to see the two chilling over some pints at the local pub
4252	Dudu42	2014-05-12	I hate to watch Reek/Ramsay scenes, but only because, like OP said, Alfie rocks. I feel too bad for Reek, whatever he deserved, it didn't come close to what he's experiencing now.
Â 
And I can't decide between rooting Iron Born or the Boltons, I think I just want to see they butcher each other.

4254	Mad Monkey	2014-05-12	I definitely thought it would be hard to sell the Reek transformaton without access to his inner thoughts / narration, but Alfie Allen does pull it off very well.

I know! He was like an abused dog for the former part.Â
4256	Lord Damian	2014-05-12	His portrayal as Theon turned into Reek, is perhaps the best acting of the entire 4 years of episodes.
4257	Widows_Blood	2014-05-12	Alfie Allen complexly blew my away in season two and he just keeps getting better and better. The most underrated actor on the show. He should have been nominated for an emmy in season 2.Â
4258	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-05-12	He's better than Dinklage, in my opinion, because his acting is way more subtle and understated but also more demanding. I still miss the broken teeth and missing fingers, but his performance just sells Reek, man. And it's cool that he didn't starve himself for the role Christian Bale style, because that shit is dangerous

Â 
My thoughts exactly! Allen blew me away this episode, while Dinklage's speech was just too cartoonish.
Â 
On a side note - you'd have him break his teeth and cut off his fingers, but not starve for a role?!
4260	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-05-12	On a side note - you'd have him break his teeth and cut off his fingers, but not starve for a role?! 


Â 
He already cut off his dong for the role, what are a couple of fingers and teeth?

Â 
Fair enough
4262	joachim	2014-05-12	The bath scene was like something out of the Ministry of Love. "Do you love me, Reek?" What's the Westorosi equivalent of Stockholm Syndrome?
4263	Cyvasse Khal	2014-05-13	I wonder who is more famous now, Lily Allen's music career or Alfie Allens stint on GoT. Much respect to Alfie though, probably the toughest character to play in the entire series and there's not much to fault him on.
Â 
Not too sure how anyone could call Dinklage's trial speech cartoonish. There's a time for subtle acting and a time where emotions need to be on full display. The trial required that latter, and Dinklage nailed it. Most of Alfie's acting this season requires subtlety and he's nailing that. Both are doing a great job and don't need to be compared.
4264	joachim	2014-05-13	^"I should have let Stannis kill all of you." That was a great touch.
4265	Koi No Yokan	2014-05-13	He's been brilliant. I do wonder if we'll see a more physical transformation for him next season? I don't really expect it, but it would be a nice touch.
4266	PhoenixFlame	2014-05-13	Man it must be fun to see the two chilling over some pints at the local pub


Â 
...Imma betting they got approached by more than one unicorn...honest mistake.

Â 
He looks thinner than last season (collarbones seem more jutty/hollow), but the main thing is how he acts it. No visible dental damage effects, but he spoke like he had some kind of difficulty (sorta slurring). Psychosomatic or choking on tears? No idea but it worked! The lighting in that last scene between them was amazing.Â
4267	Envie	2014-05-13	Alfie has really surprised me with how well he's adapted to the degeneration of his character into Reek. It was easy to see him playing the cocky arrogant jerk he was at Winterfell in the first season. Then when he started making huge mistakes and trying to impress his Father and the horrific murders at Winterfell after that - it all started him on that tragic transformation.Â 
Â 
But by this season, the transformation is complete and we no longer recognize the Theon Greyjoy we loved to hate in the first two season. Now we feel genuinely pained and sympathetic to the trauma he's gone through. Now THAT takes some very good script writing, directing and acting to pull off well. I'd say Theon's story arcs is one of the most difficult to portray from the books. Â Alfie and the writers who have coached him through this transformation have NAILED IT.
4268	Tixu Oty	2014-05-13	Man Alfie was seriously awesome in this ep. Now we know for sure he's gonna kill it next season.
Rheon also played a good Ramsay, though a bit too funny for me.
And their storyline was changed around a lot, but it totally worked. I loved it all.
4269	lightbringer333	2014-05-13	How can one survive without taking bath n good food ?  theon looks well muscled n in shape when he undresses infront of ramsay.

Ya Alfie Allen has really been ridiculously good in the role of which he hasn't seemed to receive a lot of attention.
Â 
He's essentially had 3 different characters he's had to play. There was the cocky, kind of douchy ward Theon from most of season 1. Then there was the Theon of season 2 where the insecurity and need for reassurance was at the forefront. Then there was season 3-4 Theon and the transition into Reek. He's played it all so amazingly well and in a way it all just seems organic . The most impressive part is just how well he makes it seem like these vastly different affects and his overall character evolution are all believably from the same person.Â
4272	Lian	2014-05-13	Seeing how amazing Alfie has been, I'm especially looking forward to season 5, Reek in Winterfell. It'll be incredible.
4273	Rooseman	2014-05-13	Alfie is fantastic, but I never had any doubts that he'd be able to pull this off. He's an amazing actor.
Â 
That twitching he does is great.
4274	Enmity	2014-05-13	Great acting. Can't wait to see him in the scene with Stannis.
4275	Gus Petch	2014-05-13	Alfie's acting has always been good. Â Unfortunately for him, that was an awful scene. Â That scene also did not belong in this episode. Â One minute, the Skinners and the Ironborn were at a standoff. Â Half-second later, we find the Ironborn on the beach. Â That scene was badly done and almost ruined an otherwise great episode.
4276	Jairion Lannister	2014-05-13	He was very good and is handling the transformation well. The closest we've seen to it so far. He's doing well because it's the sort of thing which can easily come across as overdone and over the top if you don't nail it. He seems genuinely terrified every time he's around Ramsay though, always taking care with his words, and it's effective between the two.
4277	BlackTalon	2014-05-13	Great thread. I agree Alfie allen has not received the attention he deserves, probably because he is so goofy looking and his role is not "bad ass" or sympathetic. I was extremely skeptical when the casting was announced but he has more than won me over. Great acting all around, especially in his "baptism" which is still my most favourite Game of Thrones scene.
Â 
I also wonder if there is rivalry between him and his sister ... just remember that humorous but still pretty nasty song she made about him. I have heard he took it pretty hard. I would have too if my sister had done that, with millions of people laughing at me, man ... now he is just as successsful as she is. Probably doesn't make es much money as she does, though.

4278	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-05-13	He's amazing and I agree that I strangely found myself completely rooting for the Ironborn this episode. Â He makes Theon/Reek entirely sympathetic and it just broke my heart when he was fighting to get away from his sister.

Â 
Yeah, I've always kind of wondered how their relationship is actually. I never really hear either of them say much at all about each other. Not that I really have seen a great deal of interviews with them. Anyway managed to track down this interview with Lily Allen after her first album came out in 2006.
Â 
http://pitchfork.com...476-lily-allen/
Â 
Pitchfork: What does your family think about being subjects of your songs-- your grandmother, your brother? 
Lily Allen: My grandmother still doesn't know. 
Pitchfork: She has no idea? Nobody's told her?
Lily Allen: No, it's not on the album, she doesn't know how to work the internet, and it's not really widely reported. 
Pitchfork: Nobody tried to ask her for a comment or anything? 
Lily Allen: No, none of that. When I wrote "Alfie", nobody really knew who I was. At first he was really upset about it, because he thought that I was just pointing out all of his bad points and attacking him. I thought it was really flattering [Laughs]. I thought he'd be really, really happy because it proved to him how much I loved him, that I care about him, and I want him to do something with his life. I suppose his paranoia-- induced by smoking so much weed-- made him think, "Why are you trying to be mean?" 
Pitchfork: Did it work? 
Lily Allen: Yeah, he's doing really well-- he's just done a film with Keira Knightley called Atonement
Â 
I think there would be a certain sibling rivalry now that Alfie is achieving success, but I don't get the feeling it's in bad spirits or anything. Lily has always gone very personal in her music whereas Alfie doesn't have that luxury in his career.
4280	Er Rn	2014-05-13	Alfie as Theon has been one of my favorite parts of the show since season 2. I didn't care for the Ironborn raid overall, but his performance as Reek was great. I'm excited to see the Theon stuff next season.

Â 
Interesting interview with big Sis on that particular song. I always loved it and thought it was hilarious. I can see where Alfie might have been a little pissed about it but she wrote it in a fun, tongue-in-cheek kind of way - not really mean spirited . It was basically a song about how Alfie smoked pot and played video games all day and needed to do something with himself. A typical jab from a big sister and who doesn't know someone like Alfie in their lives like that? LOL.Â 
Â 
Well I guess he's not sitting around smoking pot and playing video games anymore is he big Sis?Â
4282	I'll pay the iron price	2014-05-13	I'm surprised Ramsay didnt get Myranda to bathe TheonÂ
4283	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-13	Theon is my favourite character as his story arc is simply one of the best I have ever read. Alfie nails it. Absolutely. Just IMAGINE a Jeyne rescue scene, this NEEDS to happen, it will be FANTASTIC.

Â 
You know, if D&D had any intentions to skip a large part of the Winterfell plot in season 5 or overly simplify it, I hope Alfie's performance would dissuade them. You're right, I'm expecting this to be full on awesome. We need a Jeyne rescue. I'm satisfied that Asha is no longer around, but now I'm worried that Myranda's still around. We need Jeyne Poole!!!

I mean, he doesn't even really register his own sister, he's THAT terrified, imagine him finally reflecting on his identity and patching himself together again, and then having the inner strength and bravery to come from the brink of torture-ridden insanity, remember his true name, and rescue a poor girl from Ramsay, it will be SUCH good television, D & D can't pass up on this, I just don't know who fArya with be as of yet. Will they get Jeyne Poole back? So far I am NOT enjoying Ramsay being almost sexy with that Myranda character, he needs to really start showing just how vile he is, we've seen what he's done to Theon, but I still I don't think it's enough to show just how disgusting and depraved Ramsay is, they need to have him being a complete monster and for Theon to go up against this big monster and save the girl.
4286	stannisismyking	2014-05-14	Alfie is incredible.Â  Theon only grew on me as a character in ACOK/S2 and as I continued to read the books I loved him him more. But now he is breaking my heart each time he's on screen. He's a nervous, shuddering, juddering wreck.Â  I couldn't even watch all the torture scenes in S3 if I'm being honest, but he's portraying "broken Theon" so brilliantly.

I think the hunt in episode 2 showed how vile he is. if anything they have showed a lot more of his cruelty than the books did. As for myranda I have no problem with that as she is also psychotic herself.
4288	Stannis Eats No Peaches	2014-05-14	Alfie is certainly one of the best actors on the show. He's brilliant.
4289	The_Lone_Direwolf	2014-05-14	As far as Reek injuries go did it look to anyone else that Reek has lost his right nipple, replaced with scar tissue?

Â 
Agree. I have yet to see a scene with him where he's intimidating and scary. Even though he's cruel he's very jolly and funny so it's hard to take him seriously. I want him to just for once be SERIOUS. They should definitely include that conversation between him and Roose where he says 'Don't make me rue the day..' it's too good of a line to pass up
4292	SuperTechmarine	2014-05-14	Alfie Allen was amazingÂ as Reek. Nailed it completely despite lacking the physical requirements. Looking forward to his scenes with Stephen "Stannis" Dillaine.Â
4293	MrsManderly	2014-05-14	He was really amazing.
Â 
My only objection - and this is nitpicking - is that he didn't seem nearly filthy and tattered enough.Â  Costume and make-up have IMO been the real stars of the GOT show, and haveÂ  been fabulous - both visually and in terms of giving plotÂ nuance and subtext - but in this one instance I kind of feel they letÂ Alfie/Reek down.Â  He should have looked likeÂ Count of Monte Cristo after 10 years in jail or the way Harry Potter movies made Sirius Black lookÂ  in Azkaban - really damn filthy, with black teeth and all that.
4294	Pericles	2014-05-14	Ramsay and Reek's scenes are brilliantly uncomfortable. Alfie Allen is such a good actor.
4295	Tixu Oty	2014-05-14	So far I am NOT enjoying Ramsay being almost sexy with that Myranda character


Â 
Yes that sex scene was really too much for me Â  So what now Jaime is a rapist but Ramsay is not? He actually has a girlfriend and they're so cuter together because they're both psychos and it makes them happy? I just don't get that.
However, the bath scene with Reek worked just fine for me. The show often plays the overly obvious card with things that are only hinted at in the show (hello Loras and Oberyn...) but I liked that they were subtle enough about it this time, yet it was there. Ramsay's relationship with Theon definitely has a twisted sexual element to it. That was brilliant. Yuck
Â

Â 
Oh you're so right. It will be nice to see a pathetic Theon becoming his mocking self again.
4296	Angmar	2014-05-14	Theon's my favorite male character from ASOIAF and Alfie is nailing it. Every scene with him is so good, he delivers a great Theon- especially in season 2!
Â 
Honestly for me D and D could butcher the rest of the story as long as they do Theon's story perfect. 
Â 
and let's pray he lives...
4297	Hath4	2014-05-14	I dont have a problem with the realtionship with mryannda. she is a pychopath and I do not think it is out of charcter. I can see ramsay keeping a girl around, if she was in to the whole sadism thing he is in too. We are not presented with the situation in the books so we have no way of knowing what ramsay would do if he came across a girl who also enjoyes inflicting pain on people. Plus we have already scene in epsiode 2 that he has a bad habit of feeding girls to his dogs so, If i was a girl I would stay away. As for The performance, it does go over the top on occasion, yes ramsay loves all the evil acts he commits, he truly loves inflicting pain, but sometimes rheon goes over the top and it bleeds into crackling comic villian. Martin manges to keep him somewaht more gorunded in the book, he is still joyful about his acts of evil, but is somewhat more seroius. Overall though i think rheon is doing a good job.
4298	Tixu Oty	2014-05-14	Rheon IS doing a good job, I agree with you on that.
What I mean is, they made Ramsay be a very different character and that change is hard to wrap my head around.
I mean, Joffrey was shown as a sadist in the show when he isn't in the books.
But the one character who is actually utterly horrible in the books, they turn him into a cute funny guy in an evil way... I'm exagerating a bit, but you get the idea. The gap is huge. Besides, I really do not think book Ramsay would keep that psycho Myranda around. Definitely not. Ramsay doesn't like to be on an equal footing with anybody. He's all about power and proving it by hurting people, especially women. But even in his interactions with all the other characters, this guy has absolutely nothing nice in him. He always got to get his point across that he's the bad guy and they all better fear him. He's not going to play along like he's an ok boyfriend. Plus the ok boyfriend situation is never depicted anywhere in the books except in Jon's case if my memory serves me right, and although it works for Jon who is clearly a progressist, Ramsay it the last person I'd expect to see in that role.
4299	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-14	Yeah I do not think myranda works at all. Cute psychopaths together with a nice kinky sex scene? Ugh no thanks, ramsay is a MONSTER.
4300	Hath4	2014-05-14	Rheon IS doing a good job, I agree with you on that.

I think tansy and all the previous girls that were hunted and fed to dogs would disagree. Eventually myranda will meet her fate, if she did not already in episode 6. Her being pychotic will buy her some extra time, but the day will come when ramsay kills her.

4301	Hodor's Dragon	2014-05-14	I'm a big fan of Alfie Allen, and have been since episode 1, but I actually thought he overdid it a little bit, at least in the first part of the scene, with his twitching and turning away from people's eyes. Â I thought of Reek from the book as somebody who was so scared of Ramsey that he kind of got it together to master the public manifestations of his insanity, and found this a little over the top.
Â 
But I got more comfortable with it as the scene went along. Â The bath scene was very powerful. Â Rheon nailed his part, too. Â He looks like he was born to play a sadistic sociopath. Â Could you see him in another role?
4302	Florina Laufeyson	2014-05-14	Â 
So far I am NOT enjoying Ramsay being almost sexy with that Myranda character

Sexy Ramsay is pretty eehh and im not really a fan. Im actually not sure what they are trying to do there unless its just fanservice cuz Iwan Rheon is nice looking. But im not cool with Hot Ramsay. As for Myranda...something tells me we arent going to see her again....
Â 


Â 
I know! He was like an abused dog for the former part.Â 


YEAH! He totally acts like a beaten dog! He sleeps in the kennels, he whimpers and whines to be fed, he slinks around with his tail between his legs. He even bites the hand that tries to save him! He recoils and slinks when presented a bath. He flinches when Ramsay raises the washcloth. Its just...WOW!Â 
Â 


I'm surprised Ramsay didnt get Myranda to bathe TheonÂ  


I dont think Myranda is around anymore. There was a scene missing from the Dreadfort segment....
4303	Hath4	2014-05-14	Yeah that scene was probably leading to her death. the scene were she slaps ramsay was missing, the episode came in short, I have a feeling that ramsay killed her. the scene was cut due to the sept and crasters scandal. HBO probably looked it over and told them to cut it. But for the girls that think ramsay is hot, remember tansy, that's all I will say.

Â 
This is the only thing I can think of that happened and caused the scene between Ramsay and Yara to feel so short and clumsy - they cut some portion of the entire sequence at the last minute and it ended up coming out weird.
4305	NOT A TARG I SWEAR	2014-05-14	Rheon IS doing a good job, I agree with you on that.


My brain short circuited when I read that at first not thinking about the actor that plays Ramsay and thinking it was some combination name of Reek+Theon. Wierd coincidence.
4306	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-15	I thought the episode was short!! I remember the slap from the trailer now. If shes dead then that makes more sense with ramsay's character.

Â 
Wow alright he's not an ok boyfriend by any standard. I guess what I meant is that I'm shocked he's actually acting like a boyfriend at all. They're holding hands, he lets her pick a victim to hunt down in the woods (ok he only really lets her believe he let her pick, but even that is somewhat of a caring gesture in an obviously devilishly twisted way), and they have what looked like nice respectful sex together where she's actually on top, and judging from the trailer, where she slapped him. If that's not putting someone on an equal footing I don't know what it would take. These two ACT like they're a team. We know Ramsay is all about himself and that's clear enough in the show too, but he does pull out that act. I can't help but wonder why.
Â 
And a lot of you here and on other threads have suspected that the sex scene was cut, which is a relief, cause when I didn't see the slap, I feared I would get another sex scene soon....
Now if that cut scene shows Ramsay taking back control in a gotcha! sort of way I'd be happy. If he ends up killing her all the better. If an Ironborn killed her and Ramsay wasn't phased a bit but hurried to Theon's cage as the half naked fight suggest, I'd be ok too. But for some reason, they chose not to show us that scene. If they thought it'd make it work better they apparently were wrong, that whole fighting scene and the matching sex scene were wrong on all sorts of levels. I'd say only great acting and lighting saved it.
So I hope Myranda is actually dead and we'll see no more of her because
1/ If she's dead, she can't be Jeyne Poole
2/ And it would mean that there was definitely some cut scene designed to shed some light on Ramsay's personality
But we didn't get it, and that's a real shame. I can only go with what I saw which is Ramsay being way too cute and funny for my taste. I mean yes, it works, but there is one truly horribly brutal character in this series, and they tone him down, while making other characters more like him (sickJoffrey, rapist and kinslayer Jaime). Don't get it, Ramsay is so scary and that's a big part of what makes Theon's story compelling, why tone him down?

Don't get it, Ramsay is so scary and that's a big part of what makes Theon's story compelling, why tone him down? I do not think they have toned him down, I mean come on the show has pretty much hit you over the head that he is the worst. if anything they have toned him up moving his mostly off page cruelties, the torture of theon and his girl hunting to directly appear on screen. and as for myranda ramsay has no genuine affection for her. She is a toy that he can play with when he is bored.
4310	Tixu Oty	2014-05-15	I don't think that Ramsay's cruelties happening off page in the book made him less horrible. If anything, it made it more horrible to me. Like it was so horrible it had to be clouded in a certain evasiveness to be bearable and Theon couldn't even stand to remember any of it clearly.
So yes, the show has to show a little more stuff than the books without needing to show it all either. It's not how much they depict him that bothers me, rather how they depict him. But I guess we'll have to agree to disagree on that one.
4311	Hath4	2014-05-15	I think the main criticism of his character has been that he is too joyful in his evil, which leads to a crackling villain. when you have a character so evil, this can easily happen. I do think Martin does a better job of grounding him in the books. Yes he is truly joyful when he is inflicting pain, but he is more serious. I think Rheon is great and based on interviews gets who ramsay is, he just needs to be a little more serious.

Â 
I do agree the main criticism against show Ramsay is how he's been written. I am sure Iwan Rheon is portraying him exactly the way they've written him, he's a good actor. They've changed the tone / personality of many of the actors and for some it works, others it doesn't. Personally I don't mind the "psychopathic joker" routine because it's television and adds a bit of variety to the style of his villainy - much like Karl's particular personality was loved by so many and hated by others. It's all personal preference when it comes to the show. In the books you get a much more detailed inside look at the characters and therefore form your own personal opinions and looks / style to them. In the show it's a lot broader strokes and literal translation so it gets debated and criticized more.
4313	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-15	Im not scared of ramsay in the show, he makes my skin crawl reading the books but he doesnt make me nervous in the show. He is a malignant presence throughout every page hes on, but in the show hes just...I dont know.
4314	Impish	2014-05-12	What's up with Varys nodding towards the throne to indicate what he is "pursuing" (his exact word choice)?
Â 
Perhaps he's trying to say that he serves the throne (or "the realm", as he says to Ned), but as shown it really looks for all the world like he is indicating to Oberyn that he desires the throne for himself. Â He of course appears to have no such designs in the book (I think it's clear he's Team Targ, which perhaps he does genuinely consider to be in the best interests of "the realm")
Â 
A precise transcription of the dialog:
Â 
Varys:Â Besides, the absence of desire, leaves one free to pursue other things...
Oberyn:Â Such as?
Varys:Â {Deliberately turns head to stare directly at the Iron Throne}
Â 
So what's going on here? Am I mis-reading something? How did everyone else interpret it?
Â 
Varys causally appearing to openly indicate "I want the throne" to Oberyn is just so.. weird. I don't know what to make of it.
4315	clawson24	2014-05-12	It was incredibly strong foreshadowing of Aegon in my opinion. Nothing more or less.
4316	FalseSpring	2014-05-12	It was a weird scene. I should ask some of my unsullied friends. But to me it looked like Varys wanted the throne. Very misleading.
4317	darndes	2014-05-12	I took it as a red herring. Â The show suggested that HE wants the iron throne and is a playing the game for himself....book readers know that he was referring to putting someone else on that throne.
4318	TheEvilKing	2014-05-12	He wants to put Aegon on the Throne. It's unambiguous, surely, if you're read the books.
Â 
For show viewers it's probably a bit confusing.
4319	OnlyOne	2014-05-12	I took it as a red herring. Â The show suggested that HE wants the iron throne and is a playing the game for himself....book readers know that he was referring to putting someone else on that throne.

Agreed, but I think Aegon is a fake, and only Varys plot. I thought it more interesting that we have such little background on Varys. Sure we have the basics, but what of his end game. Why Aegon? It most certainly isn't for 'the good of the realm'. That's a lie I never bought into.
4320	ground_control	2014-05-12	Varys causally appearing to openly indicate "I want the throne" to Oberyn is just so.. weird. I don't know what to make of it.


I'm guessing the writers are tired of hearing people complain about how mustache-twirly Littlefinger is, so they wanted to show an actual mustache being twirled...
Â 
Bad directing, that "nod" just kills the whole scene. Â Varys should have just walked forward (and to right of Prince Oberyn) so that Oberyn had to turn to keep looking at Varys, and then have the throne in the background. Â That way, we (the audience) can see what's meant but it doesn't look like Varys is giving Oberyn any insight.
4321	Asshat by the Shadow	2014-05-12	I think it was foreshadowing Aegon, but I also think it was to set up a contrast between Varys and Littlefinger. After last week's episode, a lot of unsullied will be paying more attention to Littlefinger's antics in his quest for power. Varys needs to be an equal to Littlefinger, so this scene was to indicate that Varys has plans in the works as well. My interpretation at least.
4322	yushkevitch	2014-05-12	I was a little annoyed by that simply because I can't imagine a master of whispers like Varys tipping his hand to anyone, never mind an outsider like Oberyn. Looking back Varys' motives through the first 3 1/2 seasons have been almost a complete mystery. Then, out of nowhere he basically says he's after the Iron Throne? Very strange.
Â 
My thinking is that this was necessary to help foreshadow his assisting Tyrion. Considering Varys' testimony against Tyrion it may be a stretch for viewers to believe he would then turn around and help the little guy escape and off his old man, unless he had a farther-reaching motivation. Oh and then there's the matter of Kevan way off in the distant future ...
4323	King Tyrion I	2014-05-12	I took it as a red herring. Â The show suggested that HE wants the iron throne and is a playing the game for himself....book readers know that he was referring to putting someone else on that throne.

Â 
Me too.
4324	-Ghost-	2014-05-12	Aegon
4325	Hot Kidney Pie	2014-05-12	Definitely Egg.Â 
He says he wants the Iron Throne.. But, not particularly for HIMSELF.
I LOVED this scene..
4326	igrewupinKL	2014-05-12	I didn't like this scene at all. My unsullied family thought Varys wanted to be king!Â 
Actors were fine, bad writing in my opinion
The only reason i could have for this scene is to make Varys seem more ambitious then previous seasons, so when that certain scene comes (ADWD epilogue) people won't be as surprised.Â 
Â 
The way it was portrayed, definitely indicated that Varys wanted it, not him paving the way for a certain Egg
4327	Chebyshov	2014-05-12	It was incredibly strong foreshadowing of Aegon in my opinion. Nothing more or less.


 
Â 
They're also throwing in little Varys back-story hints. They mentioned how he's from Myr. I bet we're going to hear Illyrio name-dropped soon.Â

They said Lys.
4329	Sigrunn	2014-05-12	I see it as another clue for Varys (or maybe Illyrio) being a Blackfyre.
4330	Koi No Yokan	2014-05-12	I took it as a red herring. Â The show suggested that HE wants the iron throne and is a playing the game for himself....book readers know that he was referring to putting someone else on that throne.


Â 
Â 


He wants to put Aegon on the Throne. It's unambiguous, surely, if you're read the books.
Â 
For show viewers it's probably a bit confusing.


Â 
Agreed.
4331	Lord Varys	2014-05-12	I actually liked that tidbit insofar as it gave a little of non-brothel backstory on both characters - until it didn't. But it would have been a little bit more interesting if Oberyn had mentioned Elia and her son in a conversation with Varys, wouldn't it? Could have worked easily enough, since Oberyn was in Essos during Robert's Rebellion, explaining why he did not participate in that war.
Â 
And of course Varys should have known pretty much everything that is to be known about Oberyn, so a lot of the conversation was exposition that didn't make a lot of sense in-universe.
Â 
On the other hand, they really seem to start to move away from the 'Varys serves the Realm' thing to 'He has ulterior motives of his own'. That's a good thing, that came across well when he mentioned that he never forgets anything. They could be really hinting at stuff here that was not yet touched upon in the books as of yet...
Â 
That said, does anyone else believe that Jorah's revelation as spy is going to be by the little birds Varys is apparently going 'to send' to Meereen very soon? And if so, why the hell would Varys want to destabilize Daenerys' court if he and Illyrio intend to motivate her to march for Volantis. If they are smart, then Jorah will be contacted by an agent of Varys to convince Dany to leave Meereen, and is overheard doing this by either Dany herself or Ser Barristan...?
4332	Mark Antony	2014-05-12	It was incredibly strong foreshadowing of Aegon in my opinion. Nothing more or less.
Exactly
4333	SkaggCannibal	2014-05-12	They finally showed some of the real Varys, the ruthless power-hungry child-mutulating one. Him persuing the throne could be read in the same way as Littlefinger, there is only a small chance LF actually ends up on it, but he has a fair chance to be the biggest power behind it, and Varys could also be going for that. Telling Oberyn his actual motive in such a clear way is strange, but with Aegon they should end up on the same side in Varys' mind. Maybe Varys was giving hints to a potential ally?
Â 
Something else, when Varys talks about Jorah Mormont betraying Dany, the camera turns to Oberyn looking very interested. Could it be the show will stall the Jorah reveal untill next season and have Quentyn deliver that news to Dany, as a means to gain her trust? The timelines wouldn't exactly add up but that never bothered the show. I do think the show will play it that Oberyn reports everything he learned in KL back to Doran, which makes Doran want to broker an alliance with Dany (in stead of the marriage contract plotpoint). Anyone thinking along the same lines? Want to know how realistic I'm being.
4334	Chebyshov	2014-05-12	They said Lys.

Right you are...always get those three-letter Free Cities mixed upÂ

Â 
I thought there was a shot this season of Dany looking angry with Jorah this season in one of the season previews, but I could be wrong. If they do have Quentyn do it, that would actually be a very smart way to go about it, but they would need to banish Jorah early in the season to give him time to get to Tyrion later on. I don't think it would affect the marriage contract plotpoint; I think that's important to leave the same so that everyone knows where Dorne's true alliances have been this whole time.

4336	FC_Lymond	2014-05-12	This conversation really brought to the fore my belief that Varys should have told Oberyn about Aegon during this time.Â  If anyone would be a help to Varys it would be the Dornish prince.Â  And yet Varys just allows the guy to go into a pretty pointless fight with the Mountain without knowing anything. Â Â 
Â 
Even if he didn't reveal the full details, Oberyn might not have thrown his life away.
4337	Ingelheim	2014-05-12	What's up with Varys nodding towards the throne to indicate what he is "pursuing" (his exact word choice)?

Â 
fAegon / the Game of Thrones itself. He likes and wants the Throne and all the games around it.
4338	SkaggCannibal	2014-05-12	All right so no Quentyn outing Jorah, I'm still glad they did a bit of Aegon foreshadowing. Everyone will find him so out of the blue (like in the books) that any prior hints are welcome. But probably Aegon will still feel as contrived as he did in the books. And that "protecting the realm"-portrayal of Varys should be walking on its last legs too, Varys is nothing like that and I can't wait untill the unsullied get to see that.
4339	Greywolf2375	2014-05-12	I think for people who haven't read the series, it causes some level of question/confusion - which is good IMO.
Â 
I think all it means is that his goal is to make sure that the throne gets to the...right person...not that he wants his behind on the throne.
4340	Snowisnobastard	2014-05-12	He wants the iron throne for aegon, who like himself, is a blackfyre
4341	Lord Varys	2014-05-12	Varys does not mutilate his little birds, they come to him that way. GRRM has confirmed as much. And cutting out tongues is not a nice thing, but it's necessary for his business operation. He does not do these things himself, or enjoys ordering them.
Â 
As to Varys aiming at the Iron Throne: If they are not completely botching his character, then his goal is to seat somebody there who is worthy of it, a good and decent king who gives the Realm a long and lasting peace. It's pretty clear in the books that this what Varys tries to accomplish with the Aegon plan.
Â 
He does not want to replace one puppet king - Tommen - with another puppet. That much is already clear. We don't know anything about an ulterior motive as of yet. But it's very likely that it has something to do with his past...
4342	Debb2	2014-05-12	I liked this conversation because it was between men of two opposites. Oberyn who lives a life full of desire and Varys with a very literal lack of "desire".

Actually it makes perfect sense. Who would be Aegon's natural allies when he arrives: his beloved uncle who is still trying to avenge him and Dorne, the kingdom of his mother. Now that Oberyn is on the small council Varys is trying to prepare him for the news about Aegon. Hints here and there are a good way of doing it.
4345	Phil Sand	2014-05-12	as soon as varys looked at the iron throne two of my unsullied friends shouted "Varys for king!" i laughed but could not bring myself to destroy their hopes.
4346	salmonsnake	2014-05-12	A friend of mine now thinks Varys will in the end reform the seven kingdoms and rule as the first 'Serene Doge' of 'The Most Serene Republic of Westeros' with elections and all that.
4347	Grand Maester Mithrandir	2014-05-12	Yep, first thought that came into my mind when I saw Varys nod towards the throne was Aegon.
This makes me nervous, like they'll spoil more things that are still ambiguous in the books.

My Unsullied BF thought it meant he wanted Dany on the IT, & that's why he could testify against a Lannister. After all, he showed in the meeting that he knows everything about her (his thought).

I one assumes he's referring to putting Aegon on the throne, him cluing Oberyn into this meaning wouldn't be unexpected though: the Aegon plan requires Dorne, and in fact Dorne is in on it to one degree or another.Â  Oberyn is a very important ally for Varys, or at least Varys has reason to believe he will be.

Yeah Varys doesn't do the cutting himself, other people do it for him. It does not change these kids would not be mutulated if it weren't for Varys, he's responsible. I don't think you're explanation excuses it one bit.
Â 
You also have a very naive image of Varys in your mind. Aegon is not especially worthy, there is no way Varys knows he would be a good King and trying to seat a King on the throne with no right to it, is treasonous, vile and endangers the realm. I get people in-story and show-watchers falling for the Good Varys, but it surprises me when readers believe it too.
4353	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-12	I took it as a red herring. Â The show suggested that HE wants the iron throne and is a playing the game for himself....book readers know that he was referring to putting someone else on that throne.


Â 
exactly this....as he said to Ned Stark, he plays his role at court...and part of that role is pretending that he desires the throne just like any other man...i agreed with some of the other assessments people made as well, that he might be preparing Oberyn for the regime change once Dany or Aegon get there
4354	JesterX	2014-05-12	I kind of think, to the writers,Â this conversation was nothing more than a continuation of the banter between Varys and LF that was always so interesting.Â  LF is away from KL and so they used Oberyn.Â  The problem is Oberyn and Varys are not natural rivals so the convo doesn't resonate as much.Â  I don't think there was any foreshadowing at all.
4355	Dragon of Valyria	2014-05-12	Skagg -- if Aegon is a Blackfyre, it's absolutely treasonous. But so was inflaming Aerys's paranoia to begin with, and so was a serving the Usurper. 
I'm unsure why it can't be both, anyway. If we assume Aegon is fake, then Varys is both a plotting conspirator and somebody who wants the best for the realm. Remember that the original Blackfyre partisans thought Daemon was the best candidate for the throne. 
Now we have a Blackfyre that Varys can raise to be his ideal king, while the Targaryen claimant is kind of terrible. 
Varys would still be a traitor. But he's a traitor who thinks his intentions are benign.
4356	LordCouture	2014-05-12	As to Varys aiming at the Iron Throne: If they are not completely botching his character, then his goal is to seat somebody there who is worthy of it, a good and decent king who gives the Realm a long and lasting peace. It's pretty clear in the books that this what Varys tries to accomplish with the Aegon plan.


Â 
Then why was he working against Rheagar's plot to take his father's throne ? Rheagar would have a make a great king and Varys worked against the guy.
4357	TheEvilKing	2014-05-12	Yep, first thought that came into my mind when I saw Varys nod towards the throne was Aegon.
This makes me nervous, like they'll spoil more things that are still ambiguous in the books.


Â 
Varys trying to seat Aegon on the throne is not even remotely ambiguous in the books.

I thought it was a very telling line, but I can't remember it exactly.
4359	Lord Varys	2014-05-12	Aegon is supposed to be a good and decent king from Varys perspective, I never said he is or will be there. But he is supposed to be that kind of king, not a pawn.
Â 
Cutting out tongues is not a nice thing, I never said that. But it seems to be necessary fro Varys POV for his enterprise. He most likely found out that the risk in using children who can talk was too great a long time ago. I never said the guy was my hero or so, he has some dark character traits. That goes without saying. But I'd still argue that those things are - like the murder of Ser Kevan and Pycelle - are done in the service of 'the greater good'. Whether he can justify his actions with this 'greater good' remains to be seen.
Â 
From what we know now this whole 'Varys is a secret Blackfyre and playing a game of revenge for whatever was done to his family/parents/whoever' is entirely speculation. And even if that was part of his game, it's also the case that at least part of this whole thing is to install a good/better king on the Iron Throne. We don't know yet how the Aegon plan was conceived, but it's entirely imaginable that Varys/Illyrio came up with this whole thing in the wake of Robert's Rebellion when they realized early on that Robert and his 'dynasty' would not be able to hold the Realm together for a longer period of time.
Â 
What has as of yet been established about Varys' character is that is entirely willing and capable of doing horrible things, but does not do so unless he finds them to be absolutely necessary. And nothing he ever did or does was for personal gain. I'm pretty sure he'd sacrifice his own life for his cause, which should make him a very dangerous opponent for anyone crossing blades with him in the future.Â

4361	TyrionsFlagon	2014-05-12	I agree with those who say it's a foreshadowing of Aegon, although the writers could take that in a different direction.
4362	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-05-12	Is it really that difficult to comprehend?

You don't have to take everything at face value and literally, it's ok to think for a few seconds about it.Â
4363	Stormland's Fury	2014-05-12	Foreshadowing for Aegon as mentioned before. But what's weird is that Oberyn doesn't know that, for him it seemed just like Varys admitted that he wanted to do a power grab. That was just careless for Varys either way.

Â 
It was a little weird for him, but Varys also probably knows he's going to be heading out of KL soon. I think since S2 he's wanted Tyrion on his side, and he sees how this trial is going.Â

Even if we don't take it to mean Varys literally wants the throne for himself (and plenty of people are taking it that way), I still find it odd he "shows his hand" to Oberyn in this way.
Â 
As for Varys' actual motives, I think he genuinely believes putting a Targ (Aegon, and/or perhaps Dany as a backup or supporting plan?) on the throne is the best thing for the realm. Â This is in contrast to Littlefinger, who is purely out for himself.

Â 
No, I meant Varys probably knew he'd be freeing Tyrion (and would have to flee even if Tywin was still alive). But you're right; Varys knew Oberyn wouldn't exactly be offended by admitting he wants power.
4368	Modesty Lannister	2014-05-12	I think it was a great scene. It showed that Oberyn's intelligence and knowledge of the Free cities have thrown Varys off a bit. Also, by "the nod" Varys is sending signals to Oberyn, signals that he never sent to anyone before. He hints at sharing Oberyn's loyalties. The nod was a bonding moment imho. We are on the same side moment.

4369	ground_control	2014-05-12	Varys does not mutilate his little birds, they come to him that way. GRRM has confirmed as much. And cutting out tongues is not a nice thing, but it's necessary for his business operation. He does not do these things himself, or enjoys ordering them.


Varys abhors the mutilation of children, but if you're going to do it anyway, he'll take them off of your hands, please have them delivered to the Red Keep, kthxbai.
4370	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-12	I didn't like this scene at all. My unsullied family thought Varys wanted to be king!


Â 
I think that's exactly what they wanted Unsullied to think
4371	ground_control	2014-05-12	I one assumes he's referring to putting Aegon on the throne, him cluing Oberyn into this meaning wouldn't be unexpected though: the Aegon plan requires Dorne, and in fact Dorne is in on it to one degree or another.Â  Oberyn is a very important ally for Varys, or at least Varys has reason to believe he will be.


*Shrug* I don't object to Oberyn noticing really, I just thought that "the nod" was a bit too unsubtle and poorly done, especially given the number of people around here who complain about Littlefinger.
4372	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-05-12	Â

Â 
He didn't show anything. What is Oberyn going to do, tell Cersei, a woman he hates, hey watch out for that guy you already don't trust? "Lord Tywin! I want to kill you, but be careful because I fear Varys is plotting!" If anything Varys wants him to know that he is a potentially powerful player.Â

4374	Hielo y Fuego	2014-05-12	I really can't see why almost everyone here thinks that Varys' unspoken reply could be about Aegon. It could easily be about Dany, since to this point (in the show and the books alike) nobody knew the first thing about Aegon, but we all knew that Varys was backing up Dany.
Â 
It could easily continue to be that way in the show, which means Aegon could still be cut.

4376	Sand11751	2014-05-12	Varys doesn't reveal these little nuggets about himself so with the nod to the throne, Aegon must be a go for next season. Also I love the quick shots of "Oh, let's see Oberyn's facial expression." You can almost see the wheels spinning in his mind each time he learns more about his adversaries. With the earlier mention of his daughters, hope we see Dorne, Doran et al next season.Â
4377	Envie	2014-05-12	Is it really that difficult to comprehend? Because he nods towards the throne when Oberyn asks him what he's interested in, does that mean he wants to sit the throne himself?

Â 
Well said.
Â 
I know two unsullied who 'got it' easily enough. They even mentioned the fact he was quick to point out to Oberyn that he "was no Lord and did not want the title" so they were pretty clear on the fact Varys himself would never be a king or ruler, he's not a Lord.Â 
Â 
I'm not sure why so many people who debate on these discussions think everything in the show must be taken literally and that show only viewers must be too stupid to get hints and clues? Varys has made it clear he has no mortal desires and that his motives are purely in putting the 'right' person on that throne. His idea of who is 'right' may not necessarily be the real Aegon or the fake Aegon... in fact that debate rages on but the bottom line is - it doesn't matter if Aegon is fake or real because there have been many pretenders (one is on it now) to the throne as well as conquerors and some were better than the 'trueborn' king who was a mad man (Aerys not Joffrey haha).
Â 
Varys wants power, that much has been obvious from the start. Every show viewer now fully understands that the "Game of Thrones" doesn't mean the winner is the one who sits on it... they know the winner is the one who successfully controls Westeros through the throne, by whatever means. For Tywin that's as the Hand of the King for his grandsons, for Littlefinger it was his position of power over the throne's finances during Robert's reign (which are obviously in ruin but LF still used it to his advantage), and for Varys it's his position as the royal spy and master of whispers - knowing and bartering secrets and paid favors is very powerful, even Tywin is somewhat cautious about how much Varys knows.
Â 
The scene with Oberyn was well done. It showed a little bit of Varys' power to both viewers and to Oberyn. Oberyn needs to know this if he's to be the family that next sits the throne (possibly via Aegon or Myrcella or both). Varys is making sure Oberyn understands that his services and power are important tools for Oberyn's side of the game.
Â 
EDIT: I also think many people lost the subtle play of words (and genders) that was going on between Oberyn and Varys. Oberyn asking Varys bluntly if he liked boys wasn't a sexual reference (though it was literally) - it was him asking who Varys preferred on the throne. He acted surprised when Varys said he didn't choose boys OR girls - but Varys explained it, and the subtle clue... that passion and desire clouded one's judgement and put bad rulers on the throne. Varys, absent those passions, was able to see the potential candidates for what they were, not their potential as mates, lovers, marriage matches for sons/daughters, etc etc which is all part of the game of thrones... of which he does not participate. He judges a ruler by their ability to lead, not whether they are a king, queen, or potential family marriage alliance like so many Lords do. Now that doesn't mean he's without his own devious motivations for WHO should be on the throne... but he's pointing out that being a Eunich exempts him from caring about the ruler's sex.

Why would they cut Aegon, it's not like there's a surplus of material to fill in Seasons 5 and 6. There are no main characters that actually affect the plot being cut. I'm not sure why everyone comes up with these theories.Â
4380	Red Priest	2014-05-12	With the way the show is diverting from the book's general course, I for one would not be surprised if Varys does actually end up on the throne.

Â 
If Oberyn won the duel (and killed the Mountain), then there would be no 'unGregor' (Ser Strong) in the future storyline for Cersei and King's Landing. I don't know how critical that story arc is for the future of the story. By the time unGregor arrived on the scene I had had quite enough of resurrected zombie characters so I wouldn't be butthurt if they did away with that entirely for the show. But having Oberyn live would change the entire plot for Dorne quite significantly. I don't see how they'd pull that one off.

Not to mention, having him win that duel would be way too much like Bronn in the Eyrie. Oberyn's death in that duel is not only an iconic scene in the books, but a great chance to shock the tv audience who might reasonably be expecting Bronn Part 2.
Â 
It would also leave Tyrion in Westeros. He'd have no reason to leave.

Â No way Aegon will be cut. Â The show has talked about Elia and the kids plenty of times, and besides, Aegon's identity is tied to Jon Snow's.

Aegon is essential to the story.

Â 
S6 will be TWOW material, so they would only have 1 season to introduce Aegon. IMO he's in, but the show does like to cut characters where they can, and some people (not me) view Aegon as extraneous.
4391	Uldra I	2014-05-12	This conversation really brought to the fore my belief that Varys should have told Oberyn about Aegon during this time.Â  If anyone would be a help to Varys it would be the Dornish prince.Â  And yet Varys just allows the guy to go into a pretty pointless fight with the Mountain without knowing anything. Â Â 
Â 
Even if he didn't reveal the full details, Oberyn might not have thrown his life away.


Â 
Varys' omission of anythingÂ regarding Aegon during this conversation is the most solid clue yetÂ that Aegon is indeed fake.Â  Oberyn would definitely want to know that Aegon, his nephew, is alive and Oberyn might have made a powerful ally for Varys as well.Â  Why wouldn't Varys tell him?Â  Guessing... Varys realized Oberyn would be able to reveal the lies surrounding FAegon.Â  Varys didn't want to risk it.Â Â  Another clue is that GRRM waited so late in the story to reveal the mummer's dragon.Â  It was as if he wanted to throw in another red herring.Â  I'm sure Martin has an important role for FAegon to play, just don't think he is Rheagar's hier.Â 
Â 
Regarding OP, it just seemed really out of place for Varys to imply he sought the IT, as if for himself.Â  Can't figure out why he would do that.

Â 
Right, but that might be a good thing.Â  I get the sense that the HBO producers aren't afraid to go off the rail in terms of doing things different from the book.Â  And there's some parts of books 4 and 5 that just plain drag.Â  Maybe I'm crazy, but hear me out:
The Red Viper was way too cool a character to kill off so quick.Â  I wouldn't be surprised if Martin has some regrets doing that.Â  He wins the battle against the Mountain.Â  The unGregor thing...a little hoaky?Â  Would we really miss it?Â  And remember, his body is still there if they decide to still do it.
After the battle, Oberyn Martell sets sail for Dorn on the ship Cercei provided for Myrcella- but this time with Tyrion in tow.Â  Almost like how they discussed before the battle.Â  Not sure where that leavesÂ  with Tyrion killing Shae and Tywin; maybe he does that and still steals away on the ship, maybe not.Â 
It was a little pecurliar that the one small council meeting they showed with Oberyn, they made partcular mention of Dany, her dragons, and Ser Jorah being a former spy for the crown that turned fully to her cause.Â  At this point in the book, Ser Jorah was already gone from Dany's service, having been outed by Barristen Selmy.Â  But Barristen already said he didn't attend small council meetings, so that's not going to happen.
Oberyn and his retinue (along with possibly Tyrion) replace the Quentyn Martell storyline, as he sails for Meereen (thanks again Cercei!) to court Dany.Â  The whole storyline with Tyrion in various states of captivity is rolled into this.
Overall I think this would make for a much tighter storyline.Â  Yes it is a somewhat big departure from the books, but I think that was inevitable.

Â 
Ok - I did hear you out.Â 
Â 
But - you are re-writing the entire last book with these bullet points.Â 
Â 
Deviating from the written material for a scene or two that ends in the same basic plot direction is fine and what D&D do all the time (ie. Craster's Keep scenes) - but what you're suggesting is complete deviation from the entire book ... . and I mean the ENTIRE book.Â 
Â 
There would be no Tyrion in Pentos ... no Tyrion with Griff and Aegon crew ... no Tyrion headed to Daenarys ... no sandsnakes plot in Dorne afer Oberyn's dead ... no reason to kill Tywin for Tyrion ... no Cersei coming unglued once everyone else in the Lannister family is gone... ALL of that would change in an instant if Oberyn were to win and thus Tyrion "wins" his trial.
Â 
They just cannot do that much change to it. I know show fans are starting to love Oberyn and they're going to cheer wildly when he decides to represent Tyrion against the Mountain - it's going to be dramatic just like the deaths in the Red Wedding were.... but sadly Oberyn has to lose.
4396	Disturber of Peace	2014-05-12	I liked the scene. 
They needed to maintain (or rather establish) Varys as a schemer. Especially when his rival,  LF,  is just doing lots of stuff.
I did mind one thing.
When Varys asked Oberyn why he went to Essos i got excited by him telling the Yronwood story. 
That was the perfect moment.  Well,  Varys must have known all already but perfect by show standards. 
You would have thought the show would not pass on a juicy thing like that,  especially since it is cool and canon (unlike some other stuff we had to listen to... ).
It also fits with the conversation theme - desire.
It would help to set up Oberyn much better than 3 brothel scenes.

Agreed, although he didn't really lose per se, it was more of a tie. It depends on how they depict the fight and make him look like. (but yeah technically Oberyn loses in any case since Tyrion is found guilty.)

Oberyn and his retinue (along with possibly Tyrion) replace the Quentyn Martell storyline, as he sails for Meereen (thanks again Cercei!) to court Dany.Â  The whole storyline with Tyrion in various states of captivity is rolled into this.
Overall I think this would make for a much tighter storyline.Â  Yes it is a somewhat big departure from the books, but I think that was inevitable.


I like your idea better than the book honestly. Us book hags would freak out if they do it this way.

Â 


Sorry didn't complete this thought.Â  Oberyn travels to Dany's court with the knowledge that Jorah was a spy, and at some point outs Jorah in front of her.Â  It just seemed odd to me that they brought this topic up during Oberyn's small council meeting, and if there's one thing we've learned, the writers don't do things for no reason.Â
4400	Fool of a Book	2014-05-12	Â 
Varys' omission of anythingÂ regarding Aegon during this conversation is the most solid clue yetÂ that Aegon is indeed fake.Â  Oberyn would definitely want to know that Aegon, his nephew, is alive and Oberyn might have made a powerful ally for Varys as well.Â  Why wouldn't Varys tell him?Â  Guessing... Varys realized Oberyn would be able to reveal the lies surrounding FAegon.Â  Varys didn't want to risk it.Â Â  Another clue is that GRRM waited so late in the story to reveal the mummer's dragon.Â  It was as if he wanted to throw in another red herring.Â  I'm sure Martin has an important role for FAegon to play, just don't think he is Rheagar's hier.Â 
Â 
Regarding OP, it just seemed really out of place for Varys to imply he sought the IT, as if for himself.Â  Can't figure out why he would do that.


Â 
Varys leaks information in small and necessary doses. Â I did not take the convo that Aegon was absolutely fake. Â In fact, when he said something like "not all of us are born Princes" Â I took that as Varys is not a Prince, but he has one handy.
4401	Envie	2014-05-12	Â 
Agreed, although he didn't really lose per se, it was more of a tie. It depends on how they depict the fight and make him look like. (but yeah technically Oberyn loses in any case since Tyrion is found guilty.)


Â 
Right - that's the bottom line I'm trying to get to when people suggest maybe they'll change it to make Oberyn win. How would Oberyn winning still keep the plot going the right direction? It would change every single thing about Tyrion's story from here on out because his champion won the fight and thus won him his innocence and freedom in the trial. The real tragedy for Tyrion at this point is that there's no turning back - the betrayal of Shae sets in motion his decisions from here on out and Oberyn dies against the Mountain (even though the Mountain eventually dies from the poisoned spear as well) ... it -was- a tie in terms of the fight itself but it was a huge lose for Tyrion's trial and finding him guilty that way means he can't buy his way out to the wall, he has to die because his champion died. That's why it absolutely must go that direction too in the show or else Tyrion won't be pushed into the coming sequence of events against his Father and fleeing King's Landing.
4402	MilkSucSouthronKnight	2014-05-12	Â 
Ok - I did hear you out.Â 
Â 
But - you are re-writing the entire last book with these bullet points.Â 
Â 
Deviating from the written material for a scene or two that ends in the same basic plot direction is fine and what D&D do all the time (ie. Craster's Keep scenes) - but what you're suggesting is complete deviation from the entire book ... . and I mean the ENTIRE book.Â 
Â 
There would be no Tyrion in Pentos ... no Tyrion with Griff and Aegon crew ... no Tyrion headed to Daenarys ... no sandsnakes plot in Dorne afer Oberyn's dead ... no reason to kill Tywin for Tyrion ... no Cersei coming unglued once everyone else in the Lannister family is gone... ALL of that would change in an instant if Oberyn were to win and thus Tyrion "wins" his trial.
Â 
They just cannot do that much change to it. I know show fans are starting to love Oberyn and they're going to cheer wildly when he decides to represent Tyrion against the Mountain - it's going to be dramatic just like the deaths in the Red Wedding were.... but sadly Oberyn has to lose.


Hehe, oh I completely realize what I'm saying there.Â  Yes, BIG parts of books 4 and 5 would be rewritten.Â  But as a book reader, I have to say the last 2 books weren't that great.Â  Its hard for me to imagine the HBO show following Tyrion from one captor to the next, following Brianne's wild-goose chase on her quest to no-where, introducing the Quentyn Martell piece, only to have him die and not do much.Â  And quite frankly as a book fan I'd LOVE it if they did that- would make for a different story and improve upon Martin's work.

Â 
I think people will get upset when he dies, (again depends how he goes out) but will look past it once the Mountain shits and pukes his way to his grave. It's not like Ned who simply got his head chopped off. Oberyn still delivers a hell of a fight, takes out the Mountain and it has political ramifications (similar to Ned in that regard).

4404	Lord Varys	2014-05-12	No chance that Aegon will be cut now. They mentioned the Golden Company this season, and they seldom/never mention stuff that is not going to pay off/appear in the future of the show.
Â 
Aegon is a very crucial part of this series. He is the only important new plot point in AFfC/ADwD that's going to make a lasting appearance.
Â 
And the fact that Qyburn is in the show, strongly suggests that they'll keep the Qyborg part of Cersei story from AFfC, if nothing else. So there is really no chance that they'll let Tyrion off the hook now by allowing Oberyn to win the duel.
Â 
Oberyn is a window into Dornish culture, and next season we are going to meet Prince Doran, Arianne, and (some of) the Sand Snakes.
4405	Darryk	2014-05-12	I think it was foreshadowing Aegon, but I also think it was to set up a contrast between Varys and Littlefinger. After last week's episode, a lot of unsullied will be paying more attention to Littlefinger's antics in his quest for power. Varys needs to be an equal to Littlefinger, so this scene was to indicate that Varys has plans in the works as well. My interpretation at least.


Â 
Â 


Definitely Egg.Â 
He says he wants the Iron Throne.. But, not particularly for HIMSELF.
I LOVED this scene..


Â 
Agree with both of these posts.

Â 
While I will agree that quite a bit of ADWD plot was odd and dragged out and disjointed (I blame the discontinuity of splitting up the previous book) - I disagree that Tyrion's story in Essos needs re-written. It was a monumental part of his character development. It was his 'redemption' phase like Jaime but in reverse. Tyrion has to go down the black rabbit hole into the pit of despair and self loathing while at the same time becoming embroiled in a new intriguing plot which he doesn't seem to care about at first but I suspect he will come to care about very much in the coming books.
Â 
They need Tyrion to go down this path on the show as well. Viewers see Tyrion as one of the heroes of the story. They need to see him brought back down into the 'gray' area and even into black the same as many others are experiencing and we anguished over as book readers.

I wouldn't be so sure.Â  I know there's theories on Aegon, but are we 100% sure that he's the real-deal?Â  Could be that Martin hasn't made his mind up about that.
Â 
And the HBO show has already deviated a few times from bringing up Rhaegar- remember how they changed Dany's dreams?Â 
Â 
We could still meet Doran, Arianne and company, but under the aegis of an Oberyn "POV" (and maybe Tyrion).Â
4408	Darryk	2014-05-12	I didn't like this scene at all. My unsullied family thought Varys wanted to be king!Â 
Actors were fine, bad writing in my opinion
The only reason i could have for this scene is to make Varys seem more ambitious then previous seasons, so when that certain scene comes (ADWD epilogue) people won't be as surprised.Â 
Â 
The way it was portrayed, definitely indicated that Varys wanted it, not him paving the way for a certain Egg


Â 
A lot of unsullied probably will think he means the throne, but it's fine. I think when it comes to Varys and his motives, it actually serves the story to confuse the audience a little bit.Â 
Â 
It's actually really well done IMO. He gestures to the throne but he doesn't say anything. Gives the audience something to chew on because they can't be entirely sure what he meant by it. Sets up the Aegon reveal really well.
4409	Twatbeards conspiracy	2014-05-12	I've always wondered if the reason Varys was so candid with oberyn was bc Varys knows of the secret treaty signed in Braavos, and they are working towards them same ends, and this was wink to oberyn letting him know as much.
4410	Lord Varys	2014-05-12	Aegon must not be the real deal to be important. I was referring to his invasion of Westeros in ADwD, and the threat he poses for both the administration of King Tommen and Daenerys by starting a successful campaign for the Iron Throne. Aegon is not going to become another joke pretender (i.e. no second Renly).
Â 
He has come to stay, and will, I think, remain a very important part of the story until the very end. GRRM has already indicated that there will be another Dance of the Dragons, and Aegon will one of the contenders for the Iron Throne in that war, most likely the one sitting on the thing when this war breaks out.
Â 
I think if Aegon had been cut Varys would have been portrayed much more like a secret Targaryen loyalist than he is in the show (i.e. they would not have shown him informing Joff and Tywin about Daenerys).
Â 
And, honestly, another Targaryen prince trying to conquer Dany's throne will make a very intriguing and interesting story line - both in the books as well as in the TV show. That certainly did/will hit the unsuspecting reader/viewer in the face - everyone thought Rhaegar's children were dead...

Â 
I still don't see how anyone could logically reason out that Varys has any chance of taking the throne himself - even if they'd not read the books. He makes it very clear he is NOT a "Lord" despite everyone calling him that (Oberyn points that out) and he goes into a lot of detail as to how he came to be in his position previously to Tyrion and others (though he declines to tell Oberyn). This is a boy from Essos who grew up a thief and was cut by a crazy madman for magical purposes. Even IF Varys were to have some secret blood ties to the Blackfyres or other semi royal houses - his claim to the throne is absolutely ZIP. He can't claim it by birthright, he has no noble house or sigil, Â he can't claim it by conquering it - he has no way to be the king and not a single soul in Westeros would see him as a potential king in any way.
Â 
It's really odd to me that anyone would have taken that nod to the throne to mean he literally wants the throne for himself as a king.Â

Â 
quick thing related to this...has anyone else found it odd how show!Varys seems to keep bringing Dany's threat? In the books, i rmr he mentioned it lightly and it was brushed off as just gossip...
Â 
show, even Tywin seems to be taking interest and Varys does keep pointing out the threats...i found it a little odd this ep...
Â 
but with Aegon's story line it makes real sense...Varys keeps everyones attention on Dany since she's making a lot of noise and has the dragons and all that...in the mean time, like a true magician/mummer that he is, keeps Aegon completely hidden...perfect sleight of hand...focus on big, flashy dragons half the world away while the real threat shows up at their doorstep
4413	Ser Dank the Jedi	2014-05-12	It was incredibly strong foreshadowing of Aegon in my opinion. Nothing more or less.


Â 
Exactly.
4414	fangirl000	2014-05-12	Varys:Â Besides, the absence of desire, leaves one free to pursue other things...
Oberyn:Â Such as?
Varys:Â {Deliberately turns head to stare directly at the Iron Throne}
Â 
So what's going on here? Am I mis-reading something? How did everyone else interpret it?
Â 
Varys causally appearing to openly indicate "I want the throne" to Oberyn is just so.. weird. I don't know what to make of it.


Â 
I interpreted that look to the throne as a catch all for power. Â Everybody knows that what Varys really enjoys is power. Power to manipulate things behind the scenes, and learning secrets, and the especially the power the knowing secrets gives him. Â  He has claimed to exercise that power in the best interest of the realm. Â But we know from the conversation that Arya overheard down by the dragon skulls that Varys has a different idea of what "best interest" means for the realm. Â Varys, in a very unsubtle move for him, is indicating he has his own plans for the Iron Throne.
Â 
The writers are laying more groundwork for the Aegon Targaryan plot, which - it seems to me - should be one of the central conflicts of the show next season. Â It's not my favorite development in the story, but GRRM wrote it, and it's a major part of the Dance/Feast books. Â They might as well use all the material they have before they have to venture further into unpublished book territory (which is all I'm going to say about the future of the TV show vs. the books).

I don't know what to make of Varys' sexuality. Back in season 2 Shae said, "I don't think Lord Varys likes fish pie" and Varys said, "how can you tell?", so they were implying he was gay. Now, I'm not sure

I tend to believe it was brought up so that the next part, where Tywin asks for quill and parchment, is where he sends a note via Vary's little bird to Ser Barristan telling him that 1) If he returns he'll be reinstated and 2) that Jorah was a spy. Sowing discord, as usual. Just a thought.

Â 
Varys' sexuality has always been ambiguous because he's been gelded and has no balls. It's implied (and in detail) that he has no sexual urges. This may or may not be true but in the books he always played up the 'simpering over the top feminine' routine, which to me was just like Pycelle playing up the doddering old senile fool routine. An act.

Â 
Always seemed to me he was asexual, but others make various jokes about him ranging from homosexuality to pedophilia because they have no idea how to react to someone who isn't interested in sex in any way.
4419	ohpooratlas	2014-05-12	I like how this show constantly presents it so the seemingly savvy characters (Oberyn in this case) seem to think they have Varys pegged, just as he suggested "you're from Essos ... Lys, yes? I recognize the accent. I have an ear for these things." "I lost it." "I have an ear for that as well." (paraphrasing obviously)
Â 
But then Oberyn's assumptions that Varys likes boys turns out to be false. Our first hint that Varys and Oberyn are on completely different levels.
Â 
Then he gives his speech about desire and Oberyn asks what it is Varys wants and we are given the ambiguous silent answer as they stare at the throne.
Â 
I saw an interesting review that pointed out that Varys has lacked an intellectual sparring partner ever since Littlefinger departed for the Vale, and in comes Oberyn and he has high hopes. But they are essentially dashed in the end when Oberyn asks him a very obvious question "what is it you want exactly?" Varys does not answer direct questions. He reveals himself through his riddles, just as Littlefinger does. Imagine his disappointment in the end with Oberyn ...
Â 
I think the scene is intentionally supposed to be confusing for non readers. Book readers really don't have a firm understanding of Varys until the end of book 5 and even then it's still muddled. Is he a Blackfyre? Is he a Blackfyre supporter? We know essentially he stares at that throne, not because he wants it, but because of who he intends to put there. Show viewers have no idea though, and we'll probably all look back on this scene and maybe new little nuances will pop out to us when we have more information in the future where his plans are concerned. It'll make more sense retrospectively I reckon.
4420	King of the Friendzone	2014-05-12	Â 
EDIT: I also think many people lost the subtle play of words (and genders) that was going on between Oberyn and Varys. Oberyn asking Varys bluntly if he liked boys wasn't a sexual reference (though it was literally) - it was him asking who Varys preferred on the throne. He acted surprised when Varys said he didn't choose boys OR girls - but Varys explained it, and the subtle clue... that passion and desire clouded one's judgement and put bad rulers on the throne. Varys, absent those passions, was able to see the potential candidates for what they were, not their potential as mates, lovers, marriage matches for sons/daughters, etc etc which is all part of the game of thrones... of which he does not participate. He judges a ruler by their ability to lead, not whether they are a king, queen, or potential family marriage alliance like so many Lords do. Now that doesn't mean he's without his own devious motivations for WHO should be on the throne... but he's pointing out that being a Eunich exempts him from caring about the ruler's sex.



Could this mean he wants the person on the throne who doesn't(, or least) desires it?
4421	I love Cersei	2014-05-12	What's up with Varys nodding towards the throne to indicate what he is "pursuing" (his exact word choice)?The obvious interpretation that came to mind was the one given in the original post.It may be stupid, but it felt to me as if Varys and Oberyn shared some common knowledge that both of them won't speak of, or maybe that what they share is that both of them at least think the other knows something they do too, but are not 100 % certain of it, on both sides.It felt as if they were almost sure that they are on the same side, that they respect, yes almost like each other but can't play with open cards.Does this make sense? Anyone else felt that way? Was it intentional on the directing/acting side or do you think I'm interpreting way too much into that scene?

Â 
There has to be more. They were the only one agreeing in the council meeting and one of them isn't interested in any sex and the other in both. Does that mean something?
4423	Pod The Impaler	2014-05-12	I don't know what to make of Varys' sexuality.


Â 
Â 
What I take from the conversation is this:
Â 
Varys doesn't have any.
He doesn't have any now, because he is a eunuch.
He didn't really have any back when they snipped him either - he was still a boy.
Oberyn guesses that Varys must have been gay (perhaps because he seems effeminate), but this is false logic. Varys was made a eunuch unwillingly, so if you just go by the odds, he was more likely hetero, but that was (pardon the pun) cut off before it ever developed. As such, Varys probably just went from child to neutered, with no puberty at all, so he never had that phase of life where he felt that way about anyone.
Â 
(And anyway, Varys also consciously acts effeminate when it suits him as a tactic, because that is what people expect of him.)

Â 
When I first saw the scene I thought he would continue saying something like "desire caused two wars already", and Oberyn would understand he meant RR at first, and then, the Wot5K. But they didn't go there.
Â 
I guess is only there to show contrast between the one character who likes to enjoy every single sexual pleasure he can against the one who isn't really interested in such things and how that doesn't blind Varys. But then, let's remind Littlefinger. He says aloud he wants EVERYTHING while Varys says nothing at all. Both are vague, but both actions define them.

Â 
I've always felt that Oberyn, a man who always takes what he wants/desires, in his zeal for getting the confession out of the Mountain, sparked the new conflict with Dorne (upcoming in next books)...LF with his desire for EVERYTHING caused the Stark-Lannister war...
Â 
Varys hasn't done anything to disturb the peace of westeros yet...as a man who does not truly "desire", he's just been sitting back and enjoying the conflict caused by LF, Cersei and others while just bidding his time, waiting for Aegon/Dany to return and restore peace to the realms...
Â 
think about it...Varys didnt kill Jon Arryn, he tried to help Ned save Robert, he tried to help Ned, he helped Tyrion at the Blackwater, he doesnt have a hand in joff's death or robs or balons....he helps tyrion escape, if tyrion didnt kill tywin, he would have probably stayed back in KL and continued bidding his time...but the outcome does benefit his cause by cersei coming along and continuing to muck things up...Kevan and Pycelle's murders are the first real thing Varys has done...
Â 
as someone said earlier, we finally get a proper idea of what Varys truly wants at the end of ADwD...i for one, cant wait to see him now that he's playing a more active role in fulfilling his "desires"
4426	Fool of a Book	2014-05-12	We've been set up from several scenes for the Unsullied to say "Whoa! Rhaegar and Elia's son Aegon Lives!"
Â 
This was no different.
Â 
Even though the show writers drilled "the necklace held the poison!" into the Unsullied, they're a bit more subtle about other things. Â Especially since, I believe, they want to keep a bit of suspense about the upcoming novels.
Â 
Nothing is really book canon, as we all know.
Â 
Can someone provide the exact phrase where Varys said something like "We aren't all born Princes..." or something like that?
4427	Robyn El Telram	2014-05-12	Surely, it was just a jest. They were two very famous men who had never met,yet had great esteem for one another, exchanging quips. It was surely meant to confuse Oberyn, to Vary's amusement. He does have a very sublime sense of humor, especially in the books.
4428	gash	2014-05-12	would oberyn not have known about varys working with doran to put a targ on the throne?

think about it...Varys didnt kill Jon Arryn, he tried to help Ned save Robert, he tried to help Ned, he helped Tyrion at the Blackwater, he doesnt have a hand in joff's death or robs or balons....he helps tyrion escape, if tyrion didnt kill tywin, he would have probably stayed back in KL and continued bidding his time...but the outcome does benefit his cause by cersei coming along and continuing to muck things up...Kevan and Pycelle's murders are the first real thing Varys has done...


Â 
I don't know what's worse; causing chaos directly like Joffrey, guiding other actors towards it like LF or just sitting idly by while it happens like Varys (although he did get up off his duff and go to Ned Stark before his execution to stave off the Stark-Lannister war). You're right in that the murders at the end of ADWD are the first overt act, but Varys had long proved he'll act when he needs to disturb the peace. He sowed seeds of mistrust between Aerys and Rhaegar. He's pretended for years to work for the good of the realm while undermining to place his and Illyrio's candidate on the throne. I enjoy Varys' interaction with LF, but both men are equally dangerous and ruthless when the goal is in reach. Â  Â
4431	The Taxman	2014-05-12	D&D really screwed up with this. How the fuck did they not mention Elia or Aegon? Oberyn could have said something like "My nephew should be on this throne right now" or something to that effect.
4432	Lord Damian	2014-05-12	The show is yet to reveal, maybe by the end of next season, Aegon - high probability Blackfyre. Sooner or later in the show, probably early next year, someone will reflect on the Blackfyre rebellions to set the stage. sort of like, the Tywin, so long as he is alive......

i wouln't call it a screw up...Aegon wasnt mentioned till ADwD was he? I completely even forgot Raeghar had a son the first time i was reading till Tyrion connected the dots! too early for dropping those kind of hints

Â 
my memory seems to be failing me...do you remember in book that was implied?Â 
Â 
do we know when Varys got to power or been in KL? i cant remember that as well...also, was it Illyrio that helped smuggle Dany and Viserys out of Dragonstone? I dont think so, i feel like they got involved much later...
Â 
reason i bring that up is because Varys has clearly wanted Targs back on the throne for a very long time. Illyrio just wants to be king of pentos, doesn't give a hoot about westeros directly...Varys knew he would not be able to stage a coup with Aegon and Dany being so young and with no force behind them...so i really believe that he's just been waiting for the right time to act...and now that his plans are almost at their end (hopefully!) he cant let Kevan stand in the way...
Â 
i think its a foreshadowing of how volatile things are going to get and sort of nearing the end for Varys to take such a drastic step himself...

4438	Ankou	2014-05-12	Varys obviously has desires. It'd be impossible for someone to function without it, even if the desire is just to not starve to death. Speaking of, Varys seems to desire food quite a bit.Â

Why would they cut Aegon, it's not like there's a surplus of material to fill in Seasons 5 and 6. There are no main characters that actually affect the plot being cut. I'm not sure why everyone comes up with these theories.Â 


Â 
It's no theory. D&D have already said that the show will run for 7 seasons, and that they won't be adding that many new characters.
Â 
If so, it's pretty safe to assume that, unless their respective subplots are important to the main storyline, anyone of Aegon/fAegon, the Ironborn and/or Dornish may be cut from the show altogether.
Â 
ETA: I never said that Aegon/fAegon will be cut, btw. I merely said that this could be the case.

Â 
Aegon was not ready to invade when the WOT5K started. Varys and Illyrio wanted a war, but an early war doesn't help them at all. That's why Illyrio asks Varys to delay it.
4444	ground_control	2014-05-12	Â 
Makes you wonder since Oberyn openly stated he spent 5 years in Essos. That's a looong time to just be a touring sight-seeing prince!Â 


In the books, he spent time in Essos trying to raise armies for Viserys before Jon Arryn made peace with Doran. Â I'd think it highly unlikely that Vary didn't know that (assuming it matters to the show).
4445	jonny__bravo	2014-05-12	Â 
Â 
Something else, when Varys talks about Jorah Mormont betraying Dany, the camera turns to Oberyn looking very interested. Could it be the show will stall the Jorah reveal untill next season and have Quentyn deliver that news to Dany, as a means to gain her trust? The timelines wouldn't exactly add up but that never bothered the show. I do think the show will play it that Oberyn reports everything he learned in KL back to Doran, which makes Doran want to broker an alliance with Dany (in stead of the marriage contract plotpoint). Anyone thinking along the same lines? Want to know how realistic I'm being.


Â 
Rewatching I twigged that interested/suspicious look (particulary in the context of the camera work of this episode) Oberyn did when Pycelle and Varys were talking about Jorah's allegiances and my mind started to wander in the same direction as your train of thought here.
It's obviously a lingering issue of how they plan to reveal Jorah's betrayal, especailly since they went out of their way last season to state Ser Barristan didnt sit on the small council in the show and wasnt aware of Jorah spying for Varys.
People have mentioned in reponse to your theory that the reveal will be this season based on shots from the trailer, I just wonder how they see it being revealed?
After pointedly making an issue of Barristan's ignorance, I cant see them turning around and having him ratting him out.Perhaps one of these "little birds" that Varys says can find there way into Meeren does the deed or gets caught.
Its got to be a big reveal, so one has to imagine the character that does it has to have equal statue as to lend credence to their accusation in Dany's eyes, hence why I see the Quentyn theory as a runner too
4446	rell87	2014-05-12	Tywin. The letter he is sending to Meereen.
4447	Jairion Lannister	2014-05-12	I took it as a strong indication about Aegon. Varys clearly wants something in the long-term, and is planning something. People may be misled into believing that is power for himself, but the conversation showed he's obviously after something.
4448	Impish	2014-05-12	Â 
I'm not sure why so many people who debate on these discussions think everything in the show must be taken literally


Â 
Â 
Where in this thread has anybody said anything remotely similar to "everything must be taken literally"?
Â 
My point in starting this thread was, we KNOW he's not literally going after the throne for himself ("He of course appears to have no such designs in the book"), so how are people interpreting this? Â The diversity of replies has been very interesting. Â I'm not sure why a couple people are taking such a combative (and borderline insulting) tone.
Â 
I'm not even complaining, I liked the scene just fine. Â This particular point though (what Varys means by indicating he is "pursuing" the throne), is certainly open to different interpretations and theories.

Â 
You're apparently reading a different tone in the thread then as nonesuch as you described was said by me or intended.
Â 
There are quite a few replies in first impressions and the various debates where people thought or wondered if Varys wanted the throne literally for himself when he gave that nod - I'm not going to go back and quote each and every one. No clue why you're singling out one single line I said in a long series of really good debating back and forth (with acknowledgement to many points) to take exception to. You're nitpicking something I said pages ago? There's plenty of other replies that are far more critical than mine and that's part of debating. If you don't want people to disagree, then don't start discussions because not everyone's going to spend 7 pages agreeing with the OP.
Â 
Edit: Your original post asked: "So what's going on here? Am I mis-reading something? How did everyone else interpret it?"
Â 
And you got seven pages of replies, many of which - including the very second reply after your OP - were interpreting it to mean Varys wants the throne. Others thought it was a forshadowing of Aegon's reveal, etc.Â 
Â 
I was nowhere in my reply intending to be combative. It's debate and skepticism and speculation.Â

4450	StrollofShame	2014-05-12	Â 
Exactly.

I had to bite my tongue  hard, and remember the Unsullied in the room, when I almost burst forth with "Aegon!!" upon viewing this scene. I drew blood, I think.
4451	bent branch	2014-05-13	My take on this scene was that Oberyn, looking for an ally on the Small Council approached Varys. This made sense since Pycelle and Mace were obviously Lannister toadies and Tywin and Cersei were non-starters. Oberyn attempted to use sex with Varys, since that works with just about anyone, right? However, sex is not an incentive for the enuch. Varys turned this approach from Oberyn on its head. Instead of becoming Oberyn's ally, he invited Oberyn to become his ally. Given that Dorne is the most likely supporter of Aegon, it makes sense for Varys to make this opening with Oberyn. However, Varys couldn't simply say, "Yo, dude. I have your nephew up my sleeve." Instead Varys let Oberyn know he was backing someone else for the Iron Throne and then just let Oberyn contemplate on that. While there was some danger to Varys in taking this approach, Varys had to approach Dorne at some point and this gave him the perfect opening. I thought the scene was extremely well done.
4452	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-05-13	I really don't think Oberyn was trying to seduce Varys. Show-Oberyn just likes to bring up sex every 30 seconds.
4453	igrewupinKL	2014-05-13	My Unsullied BF thought it meant he wanted Dany on the IT, & that's why he could testify against a Lannister. After all, he showed in the meeting that he knows everything about her (his thought).


Â 
Yeh scene was confusing
4454	igrewupinKL	2014-05-13	Â 
I think that's exactly what they wanted Unsullied to think 


Well its VERY out of character
4455	igrewupinKL	2014-05-13	Â 
A lot of unsullied probably will think he means the throne, but it's fine. I think when it comes to Varys and his motives, it actually serves the story to confuse the audience a little bit.Â 
Â 
It's actually really well done IMO. He gestures to the throne but he doesn't say anything. Gives the audience something to chew on because they can't be entirely sure what he meant by it. Sets up the Aegon reveal really well.


I know whats going to happen, and it even confused me- Varys would never speak out like that
4456	bent branch	2014-05-13	I really don't think Oberyn was trying to seduce Varys. Show-Oberyn just likes to bring up sex every 30 seconds.


Â 
I don't think Oberyn was trying to seduce Varys either. It was obvious that he was just offering Varys some of the boys at the brothel. However, Oberyn hoped to get Varys on his side by making use of Varys' needs, which Varys didn't have. Oberyn didn't expect that.
4457	RedShirt47	2014-05-13	Clever show viewers will remember back to season 1 when Varys and Illyrio were talking about "putting a dragon on the throne" which Arya hears in the tunnels under the Red Keep.
Â 
Not so clever show viewers won't even notice the comment.
Â 
For book readers it foreshadows Aegon.
4458	MyLittleFinger	2014-05-13	Seemed fairly simple, without personal needs and wants he can pursue things for others without pause and hesitation. Aka Aegon
4459	The Eunuch	2014-05-13	It does not change these kids would not be mutulated if it weren't for Varys, he's responsible.


Â 
Have you any proof? In fact, when Varys requests more little birds to Illyrio (in GOT), Illyrio says : "the ones you need are so hard to find". And Varys answers : "treat them gently...". What you say is in total contradiction with this... It seems clear that they recruit mutilated children. As I said somewhere else, saying "Varys mutilates children" is like saying "the Hound burns children's faces"... That doesn't make any sense. It is their childhood trauma, what made their personality... They would not do that to other innocent children, especially as Varys says he works "for the children".
As for the Varys/Oberyn conversation, that was perfect! This is a good hint that Varys will need Dorne's support for Aegon (if he's not already working with Doran, being his "friend at court".).

4460	theseven	2014-05-13	Yeah Varys doesn't do the cutting himself, other people do it for him. It does not change these kids would not be mutulated if it weren't for Varys, he's responsible. I don't think you're explanation excuses it one bit.
Â 
You also have a very naive image of Varys in your mind. Aegon is not especially worthy, there is no way Varys knows he would be a good King and trying to seat a King on the throne with no right to it, is treasonous, vile and endangers the realm. I get people in-story and show-watchers falling for the Good Varys, but it surprises me when readers believe it too.


where do you get the information that the little birds are cut ? I can't find anything about it.
4461	The Eunuch	2014-05-13	Oberyn would definitely want to know that Aegon, his nephew, is alive and Oberyn might have made a powerful ally for Varys as well.Â  Why wouldn't Varys tell him?


Â 
Because Oberyn would totally screw up his 18 years-long plan? Oberyn is hot-tempered, he would crown Aegon as soon as possible and go to war against the whole realm (exactly like his daughters wanted or Arianne with Myrcella), and would be crushed by the Lannister/Tyrell/Bolton/Frey/Arrynfinger alliance.
Instead, Varys plays the long term game and destroys in secret the Lannisters and their alliance with the Tyrells.
Â 


i didnt consider this, but the show might actually decide to cut out Aegon to save time so they can wrap up the rest in 3 seasons...


Â 
Pure speculation. Aegon (real or fake) is a game changer, and he may sit on the Iron Throne... They didn't cut useless characters like Hot Pie and added sexual material with Podrick, there's absolutely no reason to cut out Aegon who's a strong claimant to the throne...
4462	Envie	2014-05-13	I was starting to worry they were cutting some things for the future when Varys was absent for so long. There were a lot of King's Landing's scenes he probably should have been in with Tywin and Joffrey, etc - anyone know why he wasn't in so many previous episodes? But then I saw him at the royal wedding and now he's back again full force in exclusive scenes so I'm relieved. I believe Varys is the definite plot link between Essos and Westeros and whatever happens or whatever they choose to include will rely on his inclusion.Â 
Â 
That being said, it's definitely just speculation whether or not Aegon will play an important role and be included prominently in the show or not. I have to think that even if he's a fake it's still really important for the overall story of Westeros - at least up to the point we were left with in ADWD which was young Aegon leading his own host of men in Westeros after sailing there and losing half his ships. There's a lot of good material covering Aegon from the Young Griff point onward that will make very good television material - particularly once Tyrion joins their crew. I find it hard to believe they'd cut Aegon completely out of the show regardless of his endgame status as true king or fake pretender. Either way he's still a definite player in the game and providing a lot of storyline.
4463	MilkSucSouthronKnight	2014-05-13	I'm going anti-Blackfyre on the show.
Â 
It's TMI for the Unsullied. Â The endgame is showing/proving who Jon Snow is.
Â 
Although F/RHaegon's real identity might matter.


I have to agree with this.Â  Seems like the general consensus of the board is that HBO is going to delve into the nuances of Aegon and Blackfyre, and I just don't see that happening.Â  HBO will not bet the franchise on some unknown kid and storyline coming out on top.
Â 
I think part of the problem is that everyone here knows the books so well that you've figured out the endings before Martin has written them!Â  I know many book readers that if I mentioned Blackfyre and this whole Aegon theory, they'd have no idea what I'm talking about.Â  And don't get me wrong, all these therories are great fun and in terms of the books you're probably correct, but I don't see HBO delving into that level of minutia.Â  This series already contains too many characters for the typcial TV goer to digest.Â  Maybe the books will have a different ending, but at the end of the day the HBO show will have Jon, Dany, Tyrion or Stannis vying for the throne, with Varys and/or Petyr Baelish somewhere in the mix.
4464	Envie	2014-05-13	Â HBO will not bet the franchise on some unknown kid and storyline coming out on top.


Â 
D&D are the only other living people on the planet who know the outcome of the endgame other than George himself. Â They've been sworn to secrecy.Â 
Â 
That being said, they HAVE to include characters who play an important role in the ending of the story and the show is quickly catching up to where no new material has been published. SO - from next season onward, we have to speculate that anything they decide to cut or include is because it pertains to the importance of the final outcome.
Â 
HBO already has the franchise in the bag at #1 4 seasons in. By 7 seasons it's not a bet anymore. It's a conclusion to a good run.
4465	Chebyshov	2014-05-13	I definitely think we're getting Aegon, but I'd doubt they'd even touch the BF thing. If it turns out in the books that he is a BF (I don't subscribe to that theory personally, but there's room for it I guess), it doesn't really add anything to the show.
4466	salmonsnake	2014-05-13	If you combined all the AFFC/ADWD things various people think could be cut from the show, you end up with two episodes' worth of material for season 5. I'm always surprised how people think GRRM introduces these things for no good reason whatsoever. And to think HBO has shit to do with the ASOIAF endgame of GOT is pretty ridiculous.
4467	Modesty Lannister	2014-05-13	My take on this scene was that Oberyn, looking for an ally on the Small Council approached Varys. This made sense since Pycelle and Mace were obviously Lannister toadies and Tywin and Cersei were non-starters. Oberyn attempted to use sex with Varys, since that works with just about anyone, right?

Very clever analysis of that scene. Kudos.
4468	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-13	It was incredibly strong foreshadowing of Aegon in my opinion. Nothing more or less.


Yep. Aegon foreshadowing.Â
4469	Impish	2014-05-13	You're apparently reading a different tone in the thread then as nonesuch as you described was said by me or intended.


Â 
Â 
Here is what I would describe as "borderline insulting":
Â 


Is it really that difficult to comprehend? [...] You don't have to take everything at face value and literally, it's ok to think for a few seconds about it.Â 


Â 
This is saying that anybody wondering about the meaning of this scene (ie, most of the participants of this thread) haven't even bothered spending "a few seconds" to think about it. Â It's a condescending, thinly-veiled insult to anyone speculating about the meaning of Varys' gesture.
Â 
Your response to this, was "Well said" (and then you echoed his sentiment... "why do people take everything so literally?").
Â 
I felt obliged to defend the purpose of this thread (and the people taking part in the speculation).
4470	Fool of a Book	2014-05-13	I definitely think we're getting Aegon, but I'd doubt they'd even touch the BF thing. If it turns out in the books that he is a BF (I don't subscribe to that theory personally, but there's room for it I guess), it doesn't really add anything to the show.


Â 
Considering that the bulk of the info about the Blackfyre Rebellion (from SSMs, Mystery Knight, Sworn Sword)and the Dance of Dragons 1.0 (tPatQ, only briefly mentioned in GoT Chapter 8), etc. comes from material other than ASOIAF, I tend to think that both D&D and GRRM won't make it much of a thing. Â Especially now. Â GRRM can always publish some other peripheral stuff about those.
Â 
Sorry, Blackfyre conspiracy people. Â I don't think it will be a thing, unless GRRM expounds in tWoW. Â And even then, D&D might find it too confusing. Â It could be mentioned in passing, but I predict it won't be central to the show.

4472	Morrigen	2014-05-13	What I take from the conversation is this:
Â 
Varys doesn't have any.
He doesn't have any now, because he is a eunuch.
He didn't really have any back when they snipped him either - he was still a boy.
Oberyn guesses that Varys must have been gay (perhaps because he seems effeminate), but this is false logic. Varys was made a eunuch unwillingly, so if you just go by the odds, he was more likely hetero, but that was (pardon the pun) cut off before it ever developed. As such, Varys probably just went from child to neutered, with no puberty at all, so he never had that phase of life where he felt that way about anyone.
Â 
(And anyway, Varys also consciously acts effeminate when it suits him as a tactic, because that is what people expect of him.)

The way that Varys discussed not having desire for either sex reminded me of when Maester Aemon was discussing how the PTWP prophecy had been misinterpreted:  the Valyrian word for Dragon was actually asexual in regards to gender. Isn't this all just a hint that Varys is either a Targ loyalist or an actual dragon via lineage?

"We aren't all born Princes..."
Â 
Best ambiguous line in the entire episode.
4474	pardalis	2014-05-14	I love this scene, and the discussion it has spawned. Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m also convinced it was moved from another episode, which could color the interpretation.
Â 
Look at Oberynâ<U+0080><U+0099>s and Varysâ<U+0080><U+0099> costumes in their first scene in 4x06, the small council meeting:
Â 
- Oberyn is wearing his yellow overcoat with embroidered suns and yellow undertunic. The inside and outside layers are almost the same color.
Â 
- Varys is wearing a dark coat which we donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t see too clearly.
Â 
Moving to the second scene in 4x06, the throne room conversation:
Â 
- Oberyn is now wearing a different coat with a flowery pattern and an orange undertunic. The inner layer is clearly orange, in contrast to the yellow coat. (Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s only because I paused to admire this coat that I noticed it doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t match the first scene.)
Â 
- Varys is wearing a dark coat with flowery embroidery. It could be the same coatÂ  as in the first scene.
Â 
Now we have the third scene in 4x06, the trial.
Â 
- Oberyn is back to the yellow on yellow, embroidered suns combo.
Â 
- Varys is wearing a dark coat, looks flowery. Looks like the same as both of the other scenes.
Â 
For part two of the trial, both characters wear the same clothes as the start of the trial.
Â 
So, either Oberyn changed clothes just to meet Varys (wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t put anything past him), there is a wardrobe continuity glitch, or the scene was moved from another episode.
Â 
I suspect the scene was lifted from 4x05. The costumes match those from the coronation.
Â 
- Oberyn is seen very briefly as Tommen is crowned. Heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s standing between Tywin and Cersei. We donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t see much of him, but the inner layer is clearly orange and darker than the outer layer.
Â 
- Varys is seen briefly, approaching the throne with Mace to bow to Tommen after the crowning. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a dark, flowery embroidered robe that looks the same as inÂ  4x06.
Â 
I think the Varys-Oberyn scene is great in 4x06. It gains a lot of subtext from being placed between the small council meeting and the trial. But it would add an interesting spin to the scene if it had originally happen just before or just after the coronation. In that case, Varys looking pointedly at the Irone Throne could be referring specifically to Tommen (a misdirection for Oberyn â<U+0080><U+0093> but recognizable to readers foreknowledge of the later books), as opposed to power in general, or hinting at a future occupant like Aegon.

Always seemed to me he was asexual, but others make various jokes about him ranging from homosexuality to pedophilia because they have no idea how to react to someone who isn't interested in sex in any way.


Â 
Yes! I think this is the scene where Varys comes out as ASEXUAL, and it's not necessarily because he's a eunuch.
Â 
Oberyn is desperately attempting to get a handle on the guy, and he on Oberyn, neither are fooled by the other's appearance, venal, carnal, superficial prince, ineffective, effeminate master of spies... Varys is extremely taken aback by Oberyn's identification of him as Lyseni, and more, a Lyseni who's worked to suppress his accent. But Oberyn fails his second try.
Â 
Varys pumps Oberyn for what he knows about Essos and then slaps him down for his "man of the people act" (or is Varys hinting he's a prince too?).
Â 
Methinks they dance about the central issue, they are both aware of the gamechanger that is Danearys and they would both support her. 1-1 and allies under the skin.

I very agree with you, I will add only that Oberyn's comment about Varys lack of Lyseni accent could be a hint to the viewer to doubt what Varys has told about his origin.
4477	7th-key	2014-05-14	I'm guessing the writers are tired of hearing people complain about how mustache-twirly Littlefinger is, so they wanted to show an actual mustache being twirled...
Â 
Bad directing, that "nod" just kills the whole scene. Â Varys should have just walked forward (and to right of Prince Oberyn) so that Oberyn had to turn to keep looking at Varys, and then have the throne in the background. Â That way, we (the audience) can see what's meant but it doesn't look like Varys is giving Oberyn any insight.


Â 
:thumbs up:
Indeed, the scene ended that way would have been perfect.
4478	Tixu Oty	2014-05-14	I have to agree with this.Â  Seems like the general consensus of the board is that HBO is going to delve into the nuances of Aegon and Blackfyre, and I just don't see that happening.Â  HBO will not bet the franchise on some unknown kid and storyline coming out on top.
Â 
I think part of the problem is that everyone here knows the books so well that you've figured out the endings before Martin has written them!Â  I know many book readers that if I mentioned Blackfyre and this whole Aegon theory, they'd have no idea what I'm talking about.Â  And don't get me wrong, all these therories are great fun and in terms of the books you're probably correct, but I don't see HBO delving into that level of minutia.Â  This series already contains too many characters for the typcial TV goer to digest.Â  Maybe the books will have a different ending, but at the end of the day the HBO show will have Jon, Dany, Tyrion or Stannis vying for the throne, with Varys and/or Petyr Baelish somewhere in the mix.


Â 
Well I'd say that IF Aegon turns out to be a Blackfyre AND if that detail actually matters, then yes, I'm sure the show will explain it in sufficient detail. But otherwise, yeah, I don't see them going out of their way to give us the backstory if it's not absolutely essential.
Â 
Â 


I love this scene, and the discussion it has spawned. Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m also convinced it was moved from another episode, which could color the interpretation.
Â 
Look at Oberynâ<U+0080><U+0099>s and Varysâ<U+0080><U+0099> costumes in their first scene in 4x06, the small council meeting:
Â 
- Oberyn is wearing his yellow overcoat with embroidered suns and yellow undertunic. The inside and outside layers are almost the same color.
Â 
- Varys is wearing a dark coat which we donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t see too clearly.
Â 
Moving to the second scene in 4x06, the throne room conversation:
Â 
- Oberyn is now wearing a different coat with a flowery pattern and an orange undertunic. The inner layer is clearly orange, in contrast to the yellow coat. (Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s only because I paused to admire this coat that I noticed it doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t match the first scene.)
Â 
- Varys is wearing a dark coat with flowery embroidery. It could be the same coatÂ  as in the first scene.
Â 
Now we have the third scene in 4x06, the trial.
Â 
- Oberyn is back to the yellow on yellow, embroidered suns combo.
Â 
- Varys is wearing a dark coat, looks flowery. Looks like the same as both of the other scenes.
Â 
For part two of the trial, both characters wear the same clothes as the start of the trial.
Â 
So, either Oberyn changed clothes just to meet Varys (wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t put anything past him), there is a wardrobe continuity glitch, or the scene was moved from another episode.
Â

Â

Â 
That's a nice observation and I only watched it once but I seem to remember that when Oberyn and Varys have this discussion, the throne room is at least partially ready for the trial. Wouldn't that be a bit off if the scene had been shot as part of "First of his name"?
4479	DaveyJoe	2014-05-14	Did anybody else get the impression that Varys was kind of growing impatient with Oberyn? Â The unemotional shaking of his head when Oberyn asked about his sexuality, the barb he threw at Oberyn when he said "not everybody is a prince." Â Oberyn's strutting around but he was born into his position of power whereas Varys has had to fight and climb to get where he is today. Â When he looked at the throne I saw it as Varys just giving a predictable answer so maybe Oberyn would leave him alone.

I feel like Varys gets these kinds of questions a lot; I feel like it happens at least once a season (I remember Littlefinger, Shae, and Tyrion doing this to him on separate occasions) and he probably finds it somewhat irritating now. It's like, "YES, I know I am a eunuch. Trust me, I was there, it's not something that you just forgot. Stop bringing it up." He even underlines it during the trial scene when he says (to Tyrion) something along the lines of, "Sadly, I never forget a thing,"When Varys files his hostile-environment sexual harassment suit against the Iron Throne, it will be these conversations that come up.
4482	DaveyJoe	2014-05-14	Oberyn wanted a new title, maybe they made him Master of HR.

Â 
Yeah, perhaps he expected better of Oberyn after Ob's first hit... To use chess terms, great opening, poor mid-game, stalemate.
4484	Sultan of Westeros	2014-05-14	Iron throne signifies power more than anything else, remember that varys quote that power resides where man believe it does, when he points to throne it means he is pursuing power.
4485	Bear Island	2014-05-14	I felt like they made a bit of a blunder with Varys this episode.
First he reports accurately on Dany, which makes no sense for book readers who know he wants Aegon to ally with Dany.
Then, he tips his hand to Oberyn and makes it seem like he desires the throne to the Unsullied, when book readers know he's talking about Aegon.
It was a weird episode. I'm all for adding Oberyn into as many scenes as possible, but those scenes were just weird.

Â 
Varys reported to Robert's council about Dany (and he set up a fake assassination). If the master of whisperers doesn't report about a new queen with dragons, it would be suspect...
Â 
And once again, looking at the throne doesn't mean he wants it for himself. The Unsullied will remember his iconic riddle to Tyrion about power and who really holds it. Plus, it seems clear now that Tommen is Tywin's pawn, even for the Unsullied. To sum up : when Varys looks at the throne, it means power.

4488	Daemon Blackfyre IV	2014-05-15	This conversation really brought to the fore my belief that Varys should have told Oberyn about Aegon during this time.Â  If anyone would be a help to Varys it would be the Dornish prince.Â  And yet Varys just allows the guy to go into a pretty pointless fight with the Mountain without knowing anything. Â Â 
Â 
Even if he didn't reveal the full details, Oberyn might not have thrown his life away.


Â 
Good point, this is always the way in any book or story oh if only he had told him. However i gotta believe that this fight is Oberyn's style he is not the war type he handles his business himself and would probably love the audience. I'm sure the Red Viper would be excited for his long lost nephew but nothing would stop him from avenging his sister he loved to death. Fighting the man who beat raped and murdered her and her children is the only satisfaction Oberyn desires in my eyes.
4489	Daemon Blackfyre IV	2014-05-15	Clever show viewers will remember back to season 1 when Varys and Illyrio were talking about "putting a dragon on the throne" which Arya hears in the tunnels under the Red Keep.
Â 
Not so clever show viewers won't even notice the comment.
Â 
For book readers it foreshadows Aegon.


Â 
Very nice catch, i am now believing that most of the things in the show are the important things in the book they have to be a bit more open with the hints on tv. Â
4490	Daemon Blackfyre IV	2014-05-15	I posted the following post in an area i was not supposed to sorry guys i'm new.
I'll post it here it relates to this topic.
Â 



For those who watch the show you will remember the episode whereÂ VarysÂ attempts to pay Shae to leave Kings Landing. In this scene he points out that the two of them are the same as in they are both born with one name and that they have no surname.
Â 
Myself like many on this board believe he is a Targaryen or Blackfyre and that he lost his man hood because of this.
Â 
The nameÂ VarysÂ definitely sounds Targ like Aerys and Viserys put together
Â 
Â 
I would also like to bring something to the board i noticed Sunday night during the Oberyn andÂ VarysÂ Throne room scene. Â i'm not sure who wrote the episode but that scene was very George R.R. Martin. I couldn't help but feel like Oberyn was acting likeÂ VarysÂ was a Prince he gave him a smirk that sold me maybe i'm nuts:
Â 
Oberyn : " Â most of us live and die in the same corner of our world and never get to see any of it. Â I don't wan't to be most of us ! Â "Â 
Â 
Varys : Â " Â Most of us aren't Prince's ! Â "
Â 
AtÂ VarysÂ statement Prince Oberyn gives the smirk that leads me to believe he knows exactly whoÂ VarysÂ is, i recommend everyone watch it again.
After Oberyn smirks and laughs atÂ VarysÂ statement he starts to pickÂ VarysÂ past apart asking questions he already knows which is what today's generation of wise men do.
Â 
Â 
Â 
I would like to now take everyone back to the beginning of the scene which directly relates to this topic and also has a conspiracy attached to it lol.
Â 
Varys : " Prince Oberyn "
Â 
Oberyn : " LordÂ VarysÂ "
Â 
Varys : "OnlyÂ Varys, i'm not actually a noble man no one is under obligation to cal me Lord"
Â 
Oberyn : " and yet everyone does "
Â 
Varys : smirks and shrugsÂ 
Â 
after this the quotes i posted before these ones come.
Â 
Now what is so interesting about this conversation ? Well for those of you who have read the Dunk and Egg book called the " Mystery Knight" you wil remember this passage :
Â Dunk : "My squire is missing."Â 
Â 
Daemon Blackfyre II ( John the Fiddler) : Â "Ran off with a girl, perhaps?"Â 
Â 
Dunk : "Egg's too young for girls, m'lord. He would never leave me of his own will. Even if I were dying,Â 
he would stay until my corpse was cold. His horse is still here. So is our mule."Â 
Â 
Daemon Blackfyre II ( John the Fiddler) : "If you like, I could ask my men to look for him."Â 
Â Dunk : My men. Dunk did not like the sound of that. A tourney for traitors, he thought. "You are noÂ 
hedge knight."Â 
Â 
Daemon Blackfyre II ( John the Fiddler) : Â "No." The Fiddler's smile was full of boyish charm. "But you knew that from the start. You haveÂ 
been calling me m'lord since we met upon the road, why is that?"
Â 
I can not help but feel that this is connected some how maybe i'm crazy but i just felt like the whole scene hinted atÂ VarysÂ being a Prince, like it's in him no matter what his name or title is.

Â 






I want to buy the Aerion Brightflame had a childÂ in Lys story but for some reason i feel like i read somewhere that GRRM said Aerion didnt' remain in exile for ever.
Â 
I know the show is different but Joffrey has his ashes in the show and the fact that he died drinking wildfire leads me to believe he dies in Kings Landing and the fact that the Council even considered his only son an option for the throne makes me think he could not have been low born or still in Lys or a bastard for that matter.
Â "Over there in that urn, the ashes of Aerion Targaryen. Aerion Brightflame they called him. He thought drinking wildfire would turn him into a dragon: he was wrong."Â â<U+0080><U+0095>KingÂ Joffrey BaratheonÂ points out what little remains of Aerion in theÂ Great Sept of Baelor[src]
4491	Uldra I	2014-05-15	...
Â

Â 
First welcome to the forums 
Second a very interesting and well thought out theory.
I like it because it is something I've been suspecting for a long time now, but never had even anÂ inkling for an argument as to how I got the idea.Â Guess, it popped in my head that Varys was actually a lost Targ prince since that is the only thing I could think of that would explain his motivation to dedicate his life to seeing another Targ back on the throne.Â  Some theorys suggest Varys was a loyal servant to the Targs, but that just rings hollow to me.Â  Seems like any faithful servants of the Targs would have just lost interest in any power plays for the Iron Throne by 15/16 years after Robert's Rebellion.Â  Your post throws a little more weight behind my own assumptions.Â  Hope we are right.Â  We'll see.Â  
Â 
ETA: Exception to everyone losing interest in IT:Â  Jon Con, but who knows maybe he's got ulterior motives behind his support of the mummer's dragon.

4492	Daemon Blackfyre IV	2014-05-15	I feel Jon Connington was the perfect guy for illyrio to seek out to train Aegon and if he were to ever arrive in Westeros with Aegon it legitimizes the claim or at least makes it a little more believable.Â 
Â 
Â When i think of Jon Connington i have to go back to the Dunk and Egg books again and pare Young Griff (Aegon) with Ser John the Fiddler (Daemon Blackfyre II) and Jon Connington with Alyn Cockshaw. Connington Â was in love with Aegon's supposed father Rhaegar and lost everything fighting for him, Alyn Cockshaw was in love with Daemon Blackfyre II and his family lost almost everything fighting for his family. In the end both men would end up supporting a rebellion for these young Princes.

4499	Koi No Yokan	2014-05-13	Asha in armour, her speech, scaling the wall first, and her "thank you". Ultimately, the end result was disappointing for me; but I love Gemma so much. Can't wait to see her finally become more prominent next season.
Â 
I also felt a bit of blood lust from all three speeches - Davos, Asha and Tyrion.
4500	The Blue Hysteria	2014-05-13	The Jamie/Tywin deal. One of the best additions to the show.
4501	Seneti	2014-05-13	So many things...:
Â 
- Bravos looks gorgeous
- Tycho Nestoris / Gatiss - perfect banker
- Davos' speech is awesome
- Salladhor being outfoxed by whores
- YAsha's speech really got me pumped and I loved that little nod to the book readers with her throwing axe
- Reek being locked in the kennels with the hounds and being so utterly broken, that he does not even trust his own sister any more
- Ramsay - "how fast can you run" - if you can suspend your disbelief, it's pure awesomeness
- shirtless Ramsay, shirtless TheonÂ  Â 
- Theon expecting every act and every word of Ramsay to be a trap
- Drogon!!! 
- first meeting between Hizdahr and Dany is pure gold + I love that D&D did not shy away from the implication of her "justice"
- the small council - Mace trying to suck up to Tywin, Cersei dismissing the dragons, Oberyn being positively bored and yet being very reasonable when push comes to shove ( I had the feeling he couldn't care less about any of the councilÂ members, but pointing out that Dany could indeed become a problem shows he's taking his job seriously nonetheless)
- Tywin writing starting to write another letter gave me this really unsettling feeling in my gut - we all know what happened last time Tywin wrote a letter Â 
- Oberyn trying to size up Varys (no puns intended)
- "We mustn't disappoint father." - perfect delivery
- Tommen trying to be as nice to Tyrion as possible and Tyrion acknowledging it, all through a few simple looks
- the testimonies (almost all of which are actually telling the truth, only representing it in such a light and context that it makes Tyrion look really bad)
- everyone's reactions to the testimonies
- OMG, the necklace did come up again!
- Oberyn looking positively bored, but then asking: "what debt?" He's clearly trying to find out where everyone in this rat's nest is standing
- Jaime confronting Tywin
- callback to their convo about legacy
- Jaime offering to leave the Kingsguard for Tyrion only to be tricked by Tywin (Tyrion will not survive five days at the wall)
- Tyrion's look at seeing ShaeÂ  Â 
- Shae's defeating testimony (she looked perfectly uncomfortable doing it)
- Shae repeating Tyrion's lines in the worst possible way + Oberyn's amusement
- Jaime's face at "I wish to confess" - you could just see his world falling to pieces
- Tyrion's epic rant + "I'm guilty of being a dwarf" and "watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than a thousand lying whores" (we hear ya, Tyrion, we do)
- the credits: best instrumental of Rains of Castamere that I've ever heard

Everything Oberyn does. Just everything. Every line, every face.

Because Mace realized she was the last witness so he better hurry up and ask an actual question soon because it was just about his last chance to at least try and look he was actually a factor in anything.

Seriously, Mace - grow a pair! Â Oberyn not bothering to stand up for Tywin. The look on his face when Tyrion said he wanted a trial by battle.Â 
Â 
This is one of the best episodes they have put together. I even really enjoyed the deviation with Ironborn/Dreadfort story. It was fun to watch and Alfie Allen is spectacular. Â Loved Yara!
Â 
Dany's storline was wonderful to see some of the fall-out of her choices and I thought the actor playing Hizdahr was fantastic.
Â 
Probably one of the best Stannis episodes so far and definitely one of the best Davos ones.Â 
Â 
King's Landing did not disappoint. I loved Tyrion's speech at the end, his anger was palpable. Loved Jaime's face and his pain the entire time. Tyrion calling Joffrey a bastard to Cersei's face. The pain and hurt b/n him and Shae.
Â 
Also: Drogon

4509	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-05-13	Big bunch of fangurling from me the minute I even HEARD Saan's voice, I was soooooooooo hoping to see him again this season.Â  The fact he said the word "Dragonstone" is a big bonus for me, too.Â  He should be made to say that word in every scene.Â
4510	Indigocell	2014-05-13	- Jaime's look when he realized giving up the Kingsguard was exactly what Tywin had been angling for all along.Â  "They say Tywin Lannister never fails to take advantage of a crisis."
Â 
- The look on Cersei's face when Tyrion called her son a "vicious bastard" in front of everyone.Â  The whole outburst in general.
Â 
- The look on Dany's face when she realized that perhaps everything is not so black and white, and that conquest was the easy part of being a ruler.
Â 
- Drogon looked really awesome.Â  I imagine it's only a matter of time before he moves on to bigger game.
Â 
- Saladhor Saan's joking about the red shirt and brown pants, I get it.Â  Huehuehue.
Â 
- Davos being a true bro and reminding us that Stannis is harsh but fair.Â  Hopefully Stannis will remind us why he has earned the loyalty of a bro like Davos in the near future.
Â 
- Braavos was pretty awesome, although the Titan was a little too big.Â  I must suspend my disbelief as I wonder how they would even build that.

4512	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-05-13	Oh yeah, Braavos. Â Actually, both Braavos and Mereen look pretty spectacular. So well done.
4513	Obebb	2014-05-13	So much to love.
Â 
-Braavos in the opening
-Salla returns
-Oberyn, Oberyn, Oberyn.
-That trial. Peter's acting was very, very great.
-And I have no idea why but Hizdahr's actor is really charming meÂ
4514	Follmann	2014-05-13	-Yes, Tyrion's trial was very well executed and Peter was amazing in it, but my favorite piece of acting in the episode was from Alfie Allen. His Reek portrayal is simply perfect, he looks utterly broken. I wish they include the rhymes at some point.
-Oberyn not giving a single fuck. I love the actor.
-Varys saying "I believe the phrase "Fuck the king" was uttered" made me laugh uncontrollably.

4516	GotDragons?	2014-05-13	This was probably my fave episode of the season so far. SO much love for this ep...
Â 
1. Tyrion (can we give Peter the damn Emmy right now please??  )
2. Jamie/Tywin exchange
3. Anything/everything Prince Oberyn (not getting up when Tywin came in was AWESOME!)
4. DROGON!!!!  (wonder what his little brothers are up to??)
5. The scene with Theon just broke my heart Â  (MAJOR kudos to Alfie Allen!)
5. A bit of humility (??) for Dany
6. Varys/Oberyn chit chat
7. The whole damned trial
8. Jamie being utterly crushed by Tyrion's "confession" and his demanding of a trial by combat
9. Shae reminding me again of why I hate her so much
10. The STARE DOWN between Tyrion and Tywin
4517	RhaenysBalerion	2014-05-13	Well-well...
Â 
- Oberyn
- Tywin
- Daenerys
- DROGON
Â 
Okay, more detailed:
Â 
- Oberyn's small council scene
- Oberyn during the trial
- Tywin and JaimeÂ 
- Tywin during the trialÂ 
- Daenerys's face when Hizdhar gave a compliment on her beauty (And I really like Emilia Clark's acting this episode)Â 
- Ramsay and Theon scene. I can't help it, Ramsay's amazingly portrayed (amazing writing, amazing actor). Â And, ALFIE ALLEN DESERVES THE BLOODY EMMY, NOT PETER DINKLAGE.Â 
- Tyrion's confession was great (though absolutely overrated by the audience yet again)
- and the BEST BLOODY SCENE OF THE WHOLE BLOODY EPISODE WAS DROGON RISING AND ROASTING THE GOAT. SO FUCKING AMAZING. He's the best CGI dragon ever. Absolutely love him.Â
4518	Roose Seal	2014-05-13	Pycelle's "..and used it to strike down the most noble childÂ the gods ever put on this good earth"

 Â  Plus Salladhor Saan
4520	Miss Carnahan	2014-05-13	I loved how the confession scene started with Tyrion saying softly "Father" and then "I wish to confess". The "father" bit gets me everytime I watch this scene (and I've watched it a couple of times by now).
4521	Stannis' shadow babies	2014-05-13	Almost everything was excellent, but if I had to pick:
-Drogon. Extraordinary. He puts Smaug to shame. Looks so real!
-Yara already establishing herself as a kickass lady (running from the hounds notwhistanding...)
-Oberyn in everything, especially "Did you?" "What?" "F** him like it was his last night on this world?" *smirk*
-Tyrion's confession and Jaime's face when he demands trial by combat.
-I was suprised by Hizdahr. He was just annoying in the books to me but with this short appearance they already gave him some dimension. And motivation.
4522	jentario	2014-05-13	-Braavos looks mouthwateringly good (dat opening shot)
-Stavos at the Iron Bank was great, it seems like the show is finally taking Stannis uphill. This was a very smart change IMO.
-Yara aside from the murky ending to that scene. Her speech was great, the hooks and the ax and all.
-Reek proving himself in a way that is better than we could ever hope for without hearing his thoughts.
-DROGON! The dragons are officially badass. We are getting really close to a very good dragon scene from the books > this was great set up
-Dany's scene in the Throne room. Thank god from no more crazy shouting. It really didn't give Emilia a chance to act and portray her softer side (which she nailed in season 1).
-Everything in King's Landing. Oberyn not standing up to Tywin (and his general witty remarks). Shae's confession (it's got much more layers than in the books). Jamie making a sacrifice for Tyrion and Tywin manipulating it apparently. All of it was perfect.
-Tyrion losing it (of course)
4523	ToTheWolves	2014-05-13	The Jamie/Tywin deal. One of the best additions to the show.

Agreed
4524	Cas Stark	2014-05-13	Braavos looked great as did the Iron Bank.
Â 
I also liked the Jamie/Tywin deal, its a rare improvement over the books in terms of plotting.

Totally agree..Â 
Thought it was a really nice touch. And served as a perfect 'breather' before they introduced Shae..
I've gotta believe that Tywin knew exactly who the next witness was.. (especially knowing that he's 'involved' with Shae in whatever disgusting capacity as book readers know) ...
My point is. He knew gosh darn well that Tyrion was going to lose it whenever Shae was called to the stand.
The deal was (in my eyes) an empty gesture to placate Jamie.
And in the process, Ty Â lost his chance at the heir/dynasty he's always dreamed of.
I love the wrinkle that this deal added.Â 
Fueled the Lannister fire all the more.

4527	sj4iy	2014-05-13	Other than Tyrion's 'confession', it would have to be the deal that Jaime made with Tywin, and the fact that Tywin was CLEARLY waiting for Jaime to come to him and had it planned out all already. Just love that Tywin was so, so smug and thought he had everything taken care of, only to have Tyrion ruin his carefully laid plans.

When i realized i was seeing the Titan pop up, i popped up a proverbial semi. lol
Â 
Mycroft Nestoris
Tywin acknowledging the twincest the only way he dared: "father children with the name Lannister!"
Oberyn sarding the whole damn thing and pretty much making fun of the trial in his own way.
Dany getting shot with the Feelz-O-Laser and finally visibly caving and realizing theres an oopsie to be had.
Hizdahr's likely bullshit story showing that hes pretty damn manipulative.
"IM REEK! REEK REEK REEK!!" Alfie 
Sallador Saan being in the episode. I need more Salla.
Davos' continuous existence.
The rise of Tyrion's Dark SideÂ<U+0099> being out there in the open. I knew Dinklage would want to play that up. I knew it...

4531	Dorne Sand	2014-05-14	Agreed


about that deal, i had the feeling from the show that tywin was already decided on sending tyrion to the wall. When Confronted by jaime about killing his own son he repeats 2 times that he will receive appropriate punishment. I had even the feeling that tywin was surprised by jaime proposal, not really expecting it, or manipulating jaime to formulate it
Â 
Great scene

Â

I mean, the scene following might have been quite pointless (although I did enjoy it because I'm a major Asha fan grrl) but that FUCKING SPEECH WAS GOLDEN.
4533	Duron Qel-Droma	2014-05-15	I liked the mentioning of Lancel Lannister by Jaime. So we know he's still around somewhere. I hope, we get to see him again next season!
4534	Asshat by the Shadow	2014-05-12	I loved seeing the Braavos animation in this week's intro. The way they had coins rolling down into the Iron Bank was a nice touch. I was looking for any sign of the House of Black and White, but couldn't find it. I have a feeling it's there somewhere though, for future episodes. I wish, for consistency, that they would put in the Eyrie. Especially since they've already animated it in season 1. If it's a matte of time, they can take out burning Winterfell. We got the point that it was burning last season, and nobody's been there since season 2.
4535	Obebb	2014-05-13	Wow, I totally didn't realize that they left out the Eyrie. That's weird, they really should put it in the opening againÂ  
Â 
I think Braavos in the opening was incredibly cute. The little Titan made me go "awww"
4536	turk mcgurk	2014-05-13	The constant burning winterfell when no one is there is old. Give us the Eyrie!!
4537	Myrddin	2014-05-13	If they released polystone models for each location from the opening credits, my desk would be littered with them.

4539	Guard of the Rainking	2014-05-13	They have done three mistakes with the opening title sequence this year. 1. Not showing Yunkai during the first two episodes, 2. not having Winterfell in just plain ruins with no smoke and 3. not showing the Eyrie. Braavos was a welcome positive.
4540	Panther2000	2014-05-13	Winterfell is KEY,Â Â  this story is mainly about the Stark Children, everyone else is sub-text ( & that includes Kings & Queens).Â Â 
Â 
I hope that they keep Winterfell, come next season( I believe) it won't be burning anymore.
4541	Envie	2014-05-13	You guys are missing the whole reason Winterfell is shown every time:
Â 
"There must always be a Stark in Winterfell"Â 
Â 
It's not just a saying. Like "Winter is Coming" it's part of the Old God laws. There *IS* A Stark in Winterfell and so they must show it.
4542	Daenerys Must Die	2014-05-13	Yeah every time a new location pops up I get giddy as with Braavos this week & Dreadfort/Mereen at the start of the season..
Â 
I suppose it would be fitting to bring back the Eyrie next episode in place of Braavos which probably won't be visited again until early next season.
4543	Hath4	2014-05-13	I wonder if moat cailin will replace the dreadfort for episodes 8 and 10.

Crazy theory. Maybe they didn't have enough time to create a new title sequence Eyrie since they gave it a new design. It would be quite the stupid reason IMO, since Dragonstone already looks completely different in the show compared to the title sequence.
4548	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-13	YES. I noticed this!
4549	Stannis Eats No Peaches	2014-05-13	I liked it a lot. I've always loved the intro and every new location gets me excited (though they really need to bring back the Eyrie).
4550	Charlie Of House Bucket	2014-05-13	I've already said it in other threads here, but this was my favorite thing about this ep, short as it was.Â  Stunning opening shot.
4551	LizBe	2014-05-13	they haven't been changing much the opnening sequence this season... the Dreadfort has appeared in EVERY episode until now even when the Boltons are not mentioned. that's why I got so freaking happy with Braavos! <3
I do miss the Eyrie a lot. they HAVE to add it next week, it'll be one of the most important arcs in Mockingbird. Â
4552	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-14	I did not notice they had left out the Eyrie though, need to be more observant, I'm surprised though as Â never skip the intro and always take note !

4557	Fevre River Warrior	2014-05-15	I loved the Braavos scenes and the ship sailing underneath the Titan. I thought that was a great way to open the espisode. And Bravos looked as I had imagined, sort of like Venice. I can't wait for more Braavos scenes and Arya's arc.
Â 
Love that Titan!
4558	The Kinkslayer	2014-05-12	In the books the only red priest that interacts with Stannis is Melisandre (Thoros on Robert's court doesn't count because he was as bad a priest as there ever was). So something that may be overlooked on Stannis' trip to Braavos is that there is a major Red temple on the way from the Harbor to the Iron Bank, so why Stannis didn't bring his red woman to convince the red temple that he is Azor Ahai come again and that he could use some of their fanatics/money?
Â 
My crackpot theory is that the Braavosi red priests would instantly see past his burned sword that emits no heat and burn him as an infidel.

4560	Tyrion1991	2014-05-12	Because the temples on Essos answer to the High Priest Benerro (fire pope) in Volantis. If the story follows the novels then he should have declared that Dany was in fact AA.

4562	Cas Stark	2014-05-12	It was an odd choice. Â I was hoping we might finally see Stannis get some great dialogue, but no. Â On the one hand, maybe it's okay since Book Stannis would never have gone to the IB in the first place. Â On the other hand, if he wasn't prepared to argue for himself, why did he go at all, and it further shows how the show feels about Stannis.

The small council has the services of LF's turnip cart to deliver information at broadband speeds. Stannis relies on sailors for old-fashioned rumors.

Â 
i feel it plays more in to show!Stannis character...he's portrayed as a man who believes he is entitled to the throne...that people should just hand it to him on a silver platter...he feels no need to justify his claim or "beg" for help with it...so far, every time he's needed help, he's sent davos to treat with people to win them over to his cause...
Â 
i feel if he gave that lecture/speech himself, it would have been worse for his perception...the audience would just think he's continuing to be a pompous, arrogant, self-righteous jerk...davos (whom most people generally like) standing up and defending stannis again, talking about all his positive qualities does give the audience at least some reason to consider that he might not be such a bad guy...so when he does go to help the NW (unless they show that someone else is steering him towards it), it wont be a surprise to the unsullied audience who hate him...
Â 
though truthfully, i always felt the stannis might have gone there more for the NW resources than to actually help and be a good king...
 Â dont hate me! Â 
Â 
Â 


My crackpot theory is that the Braavosi red priests would instantly see past his burned sword that emits no heat and burn him as an infidel.

Â 
I think that was the best compromise they could do given how they wrote him going to Braavos in the first place. Stannis is no great talker and doesn't really need to ("Come with me and take the city!"). He presented his case to the IB and didn't sugar coat it and neither did he need to in his own eyes. He gave Davos a "you had your chance Onion Knight" look and Davos took initiative. Wouldn't really fit for Stannis to praise himself or need to explain why he is the one who should get the loan.
Â 
So all in all they did the best they could with the way they wrote his character so far.

Â 
What?! No way. For me, this was the point in the story when I realized that Stannis actually cares about his Kingdom, and not just being King. It's the point where Stannis actually starts to try to heal the war torn kingdom instead of shedding more unnecessary blood. Plus, Stannis brought more resources than he gained anyway. He arguably only gained a new spot to keep the majority of his host. Whereas he gave the Night's Watch several garrisoned castles.Â

Â 
i'll re-read the books in a few weeks to see if get your POV...
Â 
from what i remember, it seemed Stannis only agreed to go to aide of NW after Davos convinces him that the people of Westeros would want a king who defends the realm...which made me think that he did it for the publicity...
Â 
then at the wall, i seem to rmr him initially wanting to recruit the NW to his cause, Jon had to negotiate like "a fish wife" to get the deal that he did, men to garrison the empty castles and ships...stannis also wanted to use Jon to get Winterfell and the north to his cause, failed in that because he got the LC position...
Â 
in short, i dont rmr book!stannis being polar opposite of show!stannis...infact, show!stannis seems to help me understand book!stannis a bit better...
Â 
but as i said, i will re-read all the books after the seaons done, will try to read with fresh eyes to see if i find something different

i feel if he gave that lecture/speech himself, it would have been worse for his perception...the audience would just think he's continuing to be a pompous, arrogant, self-righteous jerk...davos (whom most people generally like) standing up and defending stannis again, talking about all his positive qualities does give the audience at least some reason to consider that he might not be such a bad guy...so when he does go to help the NW (unless they show that someone else is steering him towards it), it wont be a surprise to the unsullied audience who hate him...
Â 
though truthfully, i always felt the stannis might have gone there more for the NW resources than to actually help and be a good king...
 Â dont hate me! Â 


Â 
Agree with everything you said here. Also, check out the look on Stannis' face when Davos gives his speech. That's the look of somebody who has never in his life had anybody speak up for him as passionately as Davos had. Kind of heartwarming when you think about it and fits perfectly with Stannis' back story as the typical middle child.

4580	The Fenris Wolf	2014-05-12	This question kind of bothered me in the books, but it is even more obvious in the show: what gives the Iron Bank its power? Â I mean in a modern economy, I can see how holding vast amounts of wealth and lending it in such sums as to finance kingdoms could lead to incredible power. Â Also how no one in their right mind would ever want to default on these loans, because the agency would be able to effectively ruin you. Â I mean it's not like the State of Michigan (for example) is going to go to war with the Federal Reserve or something to get some of that sweet, sweet cash.
Â 
But in GRRM's universe, one of the principle concepts is that might makes right. Â Though the Starks happen to be (in this generation at least) noble and respectful of the rights of most people, let's not pretend that their wealth and privilege doesn't come from their overwhelming military strength in the North. Â Khalasars in Essos regularly roll up on cities and demand payments to keep them from sacking them. Â If someone showed up at Casterly Rock asking for reparations for Gregor Clegane's men, they'd be laughed at.
Â 
So my question is: why do people sweat the Iron Bank? Â Why wouldn't the combined lords of Westeros just get together and sack them? Â I'm thinking of a very close facsimile to the IB in real life, the Knights Templar. Â I'm not a historian, but I seem to remember the Pope and some other nobility getting together and destroying them out of fear of their growing influence.
Â 
What do you guys think? Â Is there reference in the books to the source of their power?
4581	Shortspear Rick	2014-05-12	Well, you kind of answered your own question there. You obviously know the leverage financial institutions can hold. As far as opposing them with the brute force that is shown to be quite effective in this world, well, this particular bank has so much available capital that they can just buy the swords to protect them if the situation arises. All of the free cities have banks but this one is richer and more powerful than all of them combined. Also, the thing about a bank is that sacking it is a far more complicated task than sacking a castle, killing the ruler and claiming victory.Â
4582	Mad Monkey	2014-05-12	Some people also believe that the Iron Bank has a relationship with the Faceless Men and the Sealord of Braavos. No one really wants to tangle with those combined institutions; the Iron Bank alone has the resources to field massive sellsword armies. If they do have an alliance with the most feared assassins in the world as well as one of the greatest naval powers in history, it might be hard to get a big consensus to tangle with them.
Â 
And even if the Iron Bank does not explicitly have an alliance with those groups, realistically if Westerosi lords invaded Braavos to sack the Bank the Braavosi would have to defend them, just as the Iron Throne would be obligated to defend Lannisport if pirates out of Lys tried to destroy it.
4583	Gabriel Belmont the Dragon	2014-05-12	Tywin knows the three truths of the iron bank
Â 
1.you do not fuck with the iron bank
2. you do not fuck with the iron bank
3. you do not fuck with the iron bank.
Â 
Tywin is not going to deny the loans they owe to them. he knows how wealthy, powerful and dangerous they are.
Â 
A westerosi invasion againts them? fat chance in that actually working cause first they can cause economic chaos in westeros many merchants and lords owe them and can tell the merchants do not trade in westeros or pay us what you owe right there and then merchants will choose what gives them an extenstion to there debt and leave the country a broke shit hole in which now the lords are gonna have to worry where there next cent is coming from.
Â 
You might say tax the people hard yeah prepare for rebellions all around. oh now that the country is broke how will they pay there army. no money no fight and no one fights for loyalty cept the starks and there practically gone.
Â 
Bottom Line the banks pen and paper is more powerful than westerosi steel.

4590	Kingpin	2014-05-13	A bank without protection is free loot, so they must have something.Â 
Â 
Either the state, secrecy and assassins, some kind of church, mercenaries...or all the above are backing them up.Â 
Â 
I'd say the Iron Bank is just the financial branch of whatever it is that holds them together.Three choices are the most likely : Â 
Â 
1. An extremely powerful family that is on top of everything.Â 
2. The city itself, but it's too "democratic" so I think it's the least possible, and I don't think it's a "union" either.Â 
3. The church of the red god.Â

Â I'm not a historian, but I seem to remember the Pope and some other nobility getting together and destroying them out of fear of their growing influence.

The IB is rich therefore the IB has power. You know the old saying "If you owe a bank thousands, you have a problem; owe a bank millions, the bank has a problem". The IB is so rich no matter how much they lent it is always thousands. They still have enough money to hire assassins, or mercenaries or to support you local rival. Anything to remove you and your family form their current position. That's the reason you pay back your debts.
4594	Gus Petch	2014-05-13	Not everyone is a debtor. Â Some of the wealthier houses who seems to manage their money very well are investors. Â Rich houses like the Hightowers, the Freys, and the Manderlys may have their gold deposited with the bank. Â
4595	Wunhopkuendo	2014-05-13	Plus the Iron Bank isn't a big vault with all the money in it. Just like today's banks, most of their money won't actually be at the bank. So invading them would do little more to them than a bank robber today would be able to do by raiding wells fargo headquarters. Sure someone might be able to get some cash from them, but they would be looking over their shoulder for the rest of their short days, especially with assassins hot on their trail.
4596	'96Buck	2014-05-13	I think one should presume that the IB finances a good bit of the Braavosi trade and enjoys a very special relationship with the political figures thereof.Â  What's good for the IB is good for Braavos, and what's good for Braavos is good for the IB.
4597	Envie	2014-05-13	Though it does not answer the OP's question as to how exactly the Iron Bank has so much exclusive and absolute power (paid assassins sounds like the best bet) - I thought this little 1 minute clip from HBO by George himself really clarified a lot of what the Iron Bank is in Braavos:
Â 
https://www.youtube....h?v=gb75OHM8E5Y
Â 
He doesn't explain the details of their power, just how they came to be so rich and where they kept all that gold.
4598	meeren	2014-05-13	Completely agree with the OP. There should be some kind of standing army protecting them. Assassins are not enough, they can't defeat an army with the assassins; an army could easily land at Bravoos and kill all members of IB and then loot what is there. Also solely depending on sellswords would be extremely stupid because sooner or later a sellsword company would discover that sacking IB would be in fact more profitable than serving them. There should exist a mechanism that will provide IB hard power besides huge wealth which is essentially soft power.
Â 
IB reminds me of Jews of Medieval Age. They were almost only moneylenders in Europe. And do you know how did kings of europe treat to them ? They borrowed heavily from them and then expulsed them or used public hatred towards them as a pretext to default on their debts. ( I protect you from the masses, so you should take this as a repayment ) Jews couldn't use their money to design the realm. Afterall, it is middle ages both in reality and in ASoIAF; you can't defeat a sword with a coin.

Â 
They don't live in Westeros but they are pretty close for a good sacking. I have already stated that they should have their own standing army and this army should be really big to protect such a huge wealth. My objection is to having only the assasins as a defense against possible aggressors.

Â 
Like in ninja assassin the movie, a ninja could clear a room if he was the attacker and noone knew about it.Â 
Â 
But when their stronghold was known, a small army force with light weapons and rifles destroyed them.Â 
Â 
The iron bank must have a standing army to protect them, and a strong one too. The city of Braavos and close allies(?) most likely.Â

Â 
This.Â 
Â 
I always suspected that Braavos -was- the Iron Bank in entirety. They control the entire city and every ship and Bravosi in it is at their disposal. This is not to be messed with.

Look at the description of Bravos
It's basically Venice, a city that remained unconquered until Napoleon and his cannon showed up with better defences
Assuming you get past the Bravosi navy you then cannot attack through the swamps but have to go into the lagoon and land your troops in the Harbor
To do this you have to sail through / under the rather decorative fort known as the Titan, whilst they drop all kinds of burning crap onto your decks
Â 
Bravos is essentially impervious to any kind of conventional external attack, so you'd need to either invent gunpowder and cannon or use a dragon,Â 
and given the description of the climate and environment (very damp) I'm not sure even a Dragon would guarantee victoryÂ

Â 
Well, i don't really have much knowledge about naval and land forces of IB and its Bravoosi allies. I just they they need a standing army and assasins wouldn't be enough to save them.Â 
Â 
So, let's assume that Stannis with his 1500 men decided to sack IB and leave immediately with whatever they could take, do you think IB have enough forces around to stop such a raid ? I don't mean anything, i just want to know miltary power of IB.

I have the impression that if Stannis created any sort of serious incident while talking to the IB representatives, he'd end up like Ser Amory Lorch in seconds, his escort the same.Â

Likewise, I don't think they would allow 1500 men if they couldn't handle every possible situation.Â

Braavos does have a military, it's a city-state.Â  But the comparison to Jewish moneylenders is flawed in a more fundamental fashion....Westerosi are not barred by the Seven from lending at interest, nor does the Church of the Seven set the bounds of civil behavior in the same way in which the Roman Catholic Church did in the real Middle Ages.Â  Jewish moneylenders lived within the zone of political control of Christendom, without being Christian, while holding a monopoly on capital.Â  Westeros is not primarily a polity of the Seven, Braavosi are not in Westeros, and many others also lend.

In that case, the lenders were co-religionists, and as you note, still cohabitors, with their borrowers.Â  The KT had a massive network of land and owned assets across Christendom...very dissimilar from the IB/Braavos.Â  That network created vulnerabilities that don't correlate to the situation here.
4611	The weirwood knight	2014-05-13	Why wouldn't the combined lords of Westeros just get together and sack them?
Â 
Because they can't.
Bravoos, the seat of the Iron Bank has never been conquered, has a huge navy and an effective assasination guild.
Noone ever dared to attack the city.
If you can't destroy the bank you can only default on your payments.
Â 
In that case the bank would't just count their losses and move on, they will fund your enemies.
Most lords wouldn't risk that, besides they wouldn't be able to apply for new loans, which can be disastrous in times of war.
Â 
Westerosi Lords like many countries today are also dependent on loans to cover necessary costs for building projects, army recruitment etc.
Without that they couldn't protect nor govern their lands.
It takes too much time to collect enough tax revenue to pay for such expenses, so you are required to borrow and spent money at once and pay it back over time.
4612	avernite	2014-05-13	I wonder, since Braavos is basically Venice, if we'll see a reprise of the 4th crusade at some point.
Â 
That is, essentially, the epitome of 'do not piss off people with a lot of money and a navy' (even if the Venetians may not have had quite as much cause for their nastiness as the Iron Bank may get - depending on how things proceed), where the Knights Templar are the epitome of 'money alone doesn't kill a man'.
4613	boojam	2014-05-13	Banking is, of course , ancient in the Western world.Greece and Rome had , tho in those times the State was sometimes the bank.Merchant banking rose with the decline in Catholic church power, and then became independent of both church and state.Some say modern banking is still too independent of the state, to wit the crash of 2008.Braavos , as a free city, has the IB independent of both church and state, indeed IF! the 'church' has any real significance in Braavos! In fact the State , Sealord of Braavos, may be a puppet of the Iron Bank.

Â 
Ha, this is a really good point. For some reason I had simplified them to that extent. Â I envisioned them as a GRRM-land version of the goblins in the Harry Potter books. Â I guess there's nothing in Martin's writing to suggest that they were anything like that.
4615	Pericles	2014-05-13	From my perspective as a student of history, Braavos strike me as a Coperate State, similar to East India Company India. Yes, it's a country, with laws, a military, etc, but it's also a company, and the two are interlinked. I suspect that if the Iron Bank got really pissed off, the Braavosi would do what the British did in the days of the Empire when faced with non cooperative debt payers.
4616	The Fenris Wolf	2014-05-13	Also, why would the Lords of Westeros unite against the Iron Bank?


Â 
Well this was my initial point. Â Everyone is scared $hitless of them, that is a perfectly good reason to unite against them. Â In fact there are a lot of historical cases of kingdoms doing exactly that: growing weary of constant threat from a distant rival, then uniting to take them down.
Â 
It seems to me that you may be able to cow some minor lords certainly. Â But families like the Lannisters, the Targaryans, or the Starks do not get to be that way by suffering threats for long. Â And if you back a nation into a corner and make it so that they have no perceivable alternative, they will eventually attack. Â Even if they don't see much chance of winning. Â IRL consider the Empire of Japan in WWII, or perhaps Vlad III's war against the invading Turks. Â Neither of these are perfect examples I understand, but I hope at least that they show what I mean.
Â 
It was just something I was curious about. Â I can definitely see what most of you are saying though, that essentially Braavos IS the IB, and to sack the most powerful of the Free Cities would be almost impossible.
Â 
Also now that I'm thinking about it, some of the other Free Cities could likely be persuaded to assist Braavos and the IB in their defense, if for no other reason than to prevent Westeros from gaining any influence in the region...very interesting!
4617	Impish	2014-05-13	Assassins are not enough, they can't defeat an army with the assassins


Â 
Tell that to Renly.  Â His army was effectively "defeated" with a single assassination.
4618	Mad Monkey	2014-05-13	Well, i don't really have much knowledge about naval and land forces of IB and its Bravoosi allies. I just they they need a standing army and assasins wouldn't be enough to save them.Â Â So, let's assume that Stannis with his 1500 men decided to sack IB and leave immediately with whatever they could take, do you think IB have enough forces around to stop such a raid ? I don't mean anything, i just want to know miltary power of IB.The mighty Arsenal of Braavos has the power to produce one war galley per day, which is a phenomenal pace. This alone makes them a preeminent naval power in that time period; the only people that could rival them (in theory) is the Iron Fleet which can't possibly have nearly the number of sailors and ships. Victarion's Iron Fleet only had 100 ships in ADWD by contrast, and that was considered a powerful force (and it was, of course).I think you're really underestimating how hard it would be to attack the Iron Bank. Forget about the Faceless Men for a second -- the only way you could get to Braavos is by ship. There's no way the Arsenal would allow an invading Westerosi navy to land on its shores for the purpose of sacking the Iron Bank. Any invader would be destroyed long before ground troops even come into play.It would be like if a foreign country invaded New York City to sack Wall Street. It wouldn't even matter what kind of personal security individual investment firms and banks on Wall Street had set up; the invaders would have to tackle the United States army, air force, and navy first solely because Wall Street is in the United States. Similarly, you can't just sack the Iron Bank without defeating Braavos militarily first, and the books make it clear that Braavos is by far the strongest of the Free Cities. There's no way that Stannis could take Braavos with 1500 or even 4000 men; maybe if Westeros put together a royal army they could do it, but it would be costly and as Fenris points out the other Free Cities may jump in to help.It seems to me that you may be able to cow some minor lords certainly. But families like the Lannisters, the Targaryans, or the Starks do not get to be that way by suffering threats for long.

IRL consider the Empire of Japan in WWII, or perhaps Vlad III's war against the invading Turks. Neither of these are perfect examples I understand, but I hope at least that they show what I mean.You're right, but I don't think that the Iron Bank pushes that hard. They seem fairly reasonable in the books at least; they allow extended repayment terms, they don't call in their loans in full even after their envoys are treated disrespectfully, and they are even willing to do business with relatively poor institutions, giving them a lot of money up front and doing personal favors for debtors above and beyond. They only play hardball when the debtor plays hardball first; other than they, they seem very accommodating and reasonable, as long as you are still making payments.Also now that I'm thinking about it, some of the other Free Cities could likely be persuaded to assist Braavos and the IB in their defense, if for no other reason than to prevent Westeros from gaining any influence in the region...very interesting!That's also a good point. Braavos and Pentos already have a strong political alliance.

In King's Landing: Varys warns the small council of Dany and tells them that she is now ruling Meereen (Jorah may still be reporting to Varys, which leads in to his getting caught later this season). Varys speaks with Oberyn in the throne room about what they want (obviously Oberyn will harp on about justice and Varys will deny that he wants the throne). Jaime speaks with Tywin about Tyrion, possibly continuing to strain their relationship to the extreme that occurred in the books ("You are not my son.") Tyrion's trial is held and we'll at least see Cersei, Pycelle, Varys and Meryn Trant testify. We'll probably get Tyrion's great "I am guilty of being a dwarf" monologue and end the episode with him calling for a trial by combat after witnessing Shae's surprise testimony.
In the Narrow Sea: Stannis and co leave Dragonstone for Braavos, arrive there and meet with Tycho Nestoris, representative of the Iron Bank. Stannis asks for gold. He will probably be turned down. Then, when Cersei refuses to pay the Bank in season five, they'll go back to Stannis. Or maybe the writers will circumvent all of that and just finance Stannis from the get go (that would take some convincing from Stannis, which ideally means an awesome speech written by Bryan Cogman, so I'm all for that lol). We might get the promised scene of Melisandre in a bathtub and/or Melisandre's powders.
Across the Narrow Sea: Daenerys treats with supplicants (probably Hizdahr and some Great Masters). Drogon is featured in the promo, but we don't exactly know what he's doing. It 's possible Drogon will kill Hazzea and the goatherd will bring Dany her bones (if this happens, I thought this would happen much later! I guess she'll be struggling with what to do with her dragons across several episodes).
In and Around the Dreadfort: Ramsay has sex with Myranda. I assume Myranda is killed and that the blood on Ramsay's body is hers. Yara sails up to the Dreadfort and infiltrates it with her men. There is a battle between the Bolton soldiers and Greyjoy raiders. Ramsay kills many ironmen (shown in the Weapons & Training video). Yara rescues Theon at some point, but is cornered and probably loses the fight. Unknown what happens to Yara (death, capture or escape?). Roose leaves the Dreadfort before the attack, presumably.
-
Â 
From the things we know are happening, this is my most anticipated episode since the Purple Wedding. We finally see Yara and get some action at the Dreadfort. Braavos looks fantastic. Did I mention Stannis is bring written by Cogman? Drogon gets up to some nasty business. And, of course, Tyrion's trial should make for great television. What do you guys think? Anything to add?

4622	Obebb	2014-05-04	I wonder if Shae will be in this episode, or will the trial go into the next one? If she will be, that'll be a shocking scene. Can't wait.

Â 
I think the trial will probably take place over the space of one episode...the 4x07 summary states that "Tyrion gains an unlikely ally," which surely means Oberyn, so I'm guessing 4x06 ends with Tyrion electing for trial by combat, and 4x07 deals with his search for a champion.
Â 
I think Sansa will likely sit out 4x06. Sophie Turner was in the first five episodes, she's rapidly burning through her ASOS storyline (with the Fingers trip and the Lysa/Petyr wedding covered in the most recent episode), and 4x07 will likely be a big Eyrie episode, named "Mockingbird" and all, so 4x06 would be a good episode for a break.
Â 
I'm very curious to see what's going to happen with Yara.

Â 
I'd like her to be, like in the books, the last witness against Tyrion. Maybe closing the episode on Tyrion's face after her speech and leaving.
4626	iheartseverus	2014-05-04	So excited for the Stephen Dillane/Mark Gatiss (Stannis, Tycho) meeting.Â  Two such fine actors at doing close, intense one-on-one meetings.Â  Both are experts at inflection, eye movements, body language.Â  Think Thomas Jefferson (Dillane) versus Mycroft Holmes (Gatiss).Â  Brilliant casting.
4627	PhoenixFlame	2014-05-05	I will forgive D&D many a thing if Ramsay keeps his shirt off the whole episode. Dear lord that actor is hot.Â
4628	Ser Couch Potato	2014-05-05	Varys warning the small council of Dany leads into Mormont being caught in the act of spying


Â 
Â 

I'm very curious as to how she's gonna find out about his spying on her. If I remember correctly, in the books it's Barristan who reveals this, but in the series I believed he mentioned to Jorah that Robert didn't allow him to sit in the small council (therefore he wouldn't know who the informer was). But of course he could've been lying in order to avaluate Jorah's character more deeply.
Â 
Regarding the actual episode, though:
Â 
I wasn't at all surprised by the way Ramsey appeared confronting the ironborn. I think it fits his character perfectly.
Â 
I'm excited to see the trial. I can't remember how it went in the books and what led to the trial by combat, and I like to watch the episode before going to the books to compare.
Â 
Â 


I think Sansa will likely sit out 4x06.


Â 

Me too. Pretty much what's left is the snow castle Lysa's murder, and I think they're gonna sit this one out until the season finale so they don't have to deal with it right now.
Â 
But the thing I wanna see the most is how they portray Braavos in the opening sequence. Really love that thing!

Â 
This. I think Shae will appear as the last witness next week, leading to Tyrion feeling utterly betrayed and Tywin asking if he wants to confess. Cue Tyrion asking for trial by combat.
Â 


I will forgive D&D many a thing if Ramsay keeps his shirt off the whole episode. Dear lord that actor is hot.Â 


Â 
 Â  Well we know we'll definitely see him shirtless in bed with Myranda, shirtless when facing Greyjoy soldiers and shirtless when entering Theon's cell, so chances are actually pretty good
4631	Gneisenau	2014-05-05	Will we see Balon die ?
4632	Colonel Green	2014-05-05	I'm very curious as to how she's gonna find out about his spying on her.

But of course he could've been lying in order to avaluate Jorah's character more deeply.
He wasn't lying.  We saw Robert's small council meet several times.  Barristan wasn't on it.
4633	JonDunn	2014-05-05	When will Tyrion get turned down by Bronn?
Â 
Bronn and Tyrion are super close in the show. Â That's going to be a shock to the audience
4634	Mel_Rose	2014-05-05	I wonder (and sincerely hope) that Bronn isn't one of those who will testify against him.
4635	alienarea	2014-05-05	I wonder if Yar(Ash)a will take the role of fake Arya.Â She can't succeed in freeing Theon only to get captured by Stannis later?
Â 
Alternatively, Arya becomes fake Arya and that is how the Hound dies on tv?

					
					
							Edited by alienarea, 05 May 2014 - 03:28 AM.
4636	The hairy bear	2014-05-05	I predict that Yar(ash)a's storyline will have her enter the Dreadfort and find out that Theon/Reek betrays her and warns the guards, showing how far he has been indoctrinated. After fighting Ramsay, and losing most of her men, Yar(Ash)a will abandon his brother and return to Pyke. At least that's how I imagine it.
Â 


I wonder if Yar(Ash)a will take the role of fake Arya.


Â 
It wouldn't make sense to use Yar(ash)a, as she is not the right age, hasn't grown up in Winterfell, knows anything about Northern culture, and any Ironborn would recognize her. A random Northern girl would be better for the job.

4637	I'll pay the iron price	2014-05-05	when we saw Ramsay andÂ  Roose in episode 2 I firmly believed that Yara would find an almost empty Dreadfort (Locke hunting Stark boys, Roose out meeting other Northern Lords to bullshit them about the Red wedding and rally their support, Ramsay off to Moat Caillin)
Â 
Wonder if she'll get taken prisoner by Ramsay too?
That way she wont be at the Kingsmoot making Euron's selection obvious!
4638	Arkash	2014-05-05	Prediction for Sansa :
Â 
She will skip episode 6.
Â 
In episode 7 we will meet the Lord Declarants (Waynwood...) plotting with / against Littlefinger. It will be, imo, the introduction episode to the politics of the Vale.
Â 
Skip episode 8 and 9.
Â 
And we all know what'd be in 10 !
4639	Hath4	2014-05-05	Should be interesting yara has reek you can see him with her and her men are holding him. it will be hard for ramsay to get reek back sense it looks to be a pretty even fight. I have a feeling reek in his broken state will choose to stay with ramsay.
4640	Talleyrand	2014-05-05	My theory is that Yara arrives at the Dreadfort but Theon isn't there Ramsay (Barry) took him south and the fight between Barry and the Ironborn is at Moat Cailan
4641	Hath4	2014-05-05	No it's clearly at the dreadfort.
4642	I'll pay the iron price	2014-05-05	Reek opting to stay with Ramsey would suck!
Yara needs to be overwhelmed then flee or be captured.
4643	Hath4	2014-05-05	why it would be perfectly in character for him, during the fight he returns to his kennel cell signifying his loyality to ramsay. would be heartbreaking for him and yara. Though who knows if this is how it plays out.

Â 
YARA: "Theon what are you doing?"
Â 
THEON: "My name is Reek. It rhymes with weak."
4645	I'll pay the iron price	2014-05-05	Theon has accepted his fate as Reek because he has nothing left to live for.
HOWEVER...........his big sister turning up with a posse to rescue him would surelyÂ re-ignite his will to live
4646	Queen of Whores	2014-05-05	Considering Theon looked very tempted to cut Ramsay's throat in 4x2, I don't find it realistic he wouldn't want to escape with Asha. He isn't that far gone yet in the show.
4647	skorpion	2014-05-05	I'm actually hoping the Iron Bank denies Stannis then is forced to back him next season.

Â 
Will Yara herself be captured thus giving Roose Bolton a whole (unflayed) Greyjoy that Balon actually cares about to trade for Moat Caillin
4649	I'll pay the iron price	2014-05-05	And why is Ramsey still at the Dreadfort?
Shouldn't he be ridingÂ for Moat Caillin by now?
4650	Mordos_Kull	2014-05-05	Could they tweak the Bolton storyline, and have Ramsey marry Yara to yield the Ironborn?
Â 
I don't know if that would work, but it's the only way they could merge those story lines (give Yara more screen time next season as well)
4651	BeornJ	2014-05-05	I think the ironborn need a win. They've been portrayed as weak very often.
Is it at all possible theon's storyline will change by having him escape?
4652	1000AcresAndAHoldfast	2014-05-05	I'm not going to complain about a new stannis scene! But I hope the wildings are in the next episode otherwise its a bit weird. they were only a few miles from castle black a couple of episodes ago only to mysteriously disappear so Jon could go adventuring at craters keep??
4653	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-05	Don't they have to raid moletown at some point?
4654	I'll pay the iron price	2014-05-05	I think the ironborn need a win. They've been portrayed as weak very often.
Is it at all possible theon's storyline will change by having him escape?


Â 
Hmmm.......................Theon escapes with Yara to Moat Caillin where Ramsay then follows, attacks and recaptures Theon.
Yara (thinking Theon was killed) could then go home for the Kingsmoot
4655	A Man has Patrol Duty	2014-05-05	I honestly think we might see Lysa's death in ep 7. They seem to be moving that storyline along quite briskly, and with all the things that will probably happen Â in ep 10 (Tyrion's escape/kinslaying, Arya giving the coin to get on the ship to Braavos, Lady Stoneheart, Bran reaching Bloodraven or meeting Leaf, Dany banishing Jorah) I can see why they'd want that done sooner rather than later.Â
4656	LordTooFat	2014-05-05	do you think there is a realistic chance they kill off asha/yara in the show? that would really piss me off as amything else so far...

Â 
Depends on GRRM has planned or not planned for her in future novels.
If her character does nothing major then the show may opt to kill her off!

Â 
I would imagine that she and Theon will have some substantial involvement in the series endgame which makes the show's decision to (probably) link her with Theon's story earlier than they do in the books a smart one.
Â 
I have long maintained that she gets captured in this raid and that she and Theon will be in Ramsay's clutches in Winterfell until they both escape only to run into Stannis as the way her plot goes. We'll see after this episode if that's the right conclusion.

4660	~No One~	2014-05-05	I think there's some masterful editing in the promo... I agree with a previous poster that the Ironborn we see are at Moat Cailin, and YarAsha fights off the remaining Bolton forces at the Dreadfort after Reek et al have already gone. I don't see why they would change this. 
Roose already sent off Ramsey and Reek. They've been traveling to the Moat since episode 2 or 3. Asha made it clear that she's going to the Dreadfort. When/where would they cross paths?
The Ramsey/Myranda sex scene could be after they've flayed the 63 Ironborn. That kind of thing really does it for Ramsey, you know.
All in all, I think this is a case of clever promo-ing.

Â 
The shots you see of Ramsay are definitely at the Dreadfort, we've seen those sets already.
Â 
As far as Moat Cailin, we've seen shots in the trailer of Theon riding a lone horse with a peace banner into a wasteland, just as he does in the books. There's no battle there.
Â 
Roose told Ramsay that he had the job to liberate Moat Cailin for him, he didn't say "go right now". There is nothing on the show that confirms they've been traveling there since E2, you're just projecting.
Â 
It's pretty clear that Moat Cailin is going to end off the season with Theon being sent there and negotiating the surrender and then Ramsay meeting Roose's army on the field in silhouette as we've seen in the trailers.Â
4662	PhoenixFlame	2014-05-05	You see them boating to the Dreadfort up the Weeping Water.
Â 
I'm totally spitballing, but maybe Yara's group gets broken up and Theon buys her time to get away. She's sure he's dead meat now so when they reunite later there's more emotional backstory to draw from, since we can't get their internal flashbacks/monologues.Â 
Â 
Oh man Roose is gonna be so pissed when he gets home. "You let WHO attack my castle?!" Between that and losing his "best hunter," the dude's going to need so much liquor. And/or some TLC from Walda! Speaking of Walda, I doubt Roose would bring her along while he's gaining the North's support. I hope we see her in this ep.Â

Yes, it is total speculation, but it is based off of the books, so it's not like it came out of nowhere. 
The scenes from the trailers and the promos are out of context. It could very well be as you are speculating, but my point is just that I don't see why they would be diverging away from the books when all the set up has been to follow (more or less, with Yara's story) the storylines as laid out already.
I'm not sure where Ramsey is in the shirtless scene, and also not sure who he's fighting. It could well be Yara's Ironborn, but to me that makes no sense.
4664	Lord_Dustin	2014-05-05	Basing this purely on the dialogue from the second episode...
Â 
I think Ramsay would do everything in his power to keep Yara alive. Â The Roose and Ramsay discussion revolves around whether or not Theon is a useful hostage. Â The answer is no because he is not 'whole'. Â 
Â 
I can see Yara being captured by Ramsay and becoming the replacement in the fArya plot. Â It is established in the show that the Boltons now rule the North, we haven't heard anything about any unruly lords (as of yet). Â Having Ramsay marry the heir to the Iron Islands could work out very well for Roose.
Â 
Again, Theon's story itself wouldn't change very much at all. Â He would still be wrestling with the idea of giving someone to Ramsay.
Â 
Stannis also has his own PoV in the TV show and would not require Yara to be with him to witness those events. Â It would also allow D & D to expand Yara's role and make Gemma Whalen a regular next season.

Except for the fact that, technically, Theon is the heir, this is an interesting idea. Poor Yara...I kind of hope this doesn't happen because she's so badass. But it would help Theon's character development to have to save her, and get her to safety/Stannis.

Â 
Absolutely, it isn't without its problems! 
Â 
The Boltons have been underused so far this season, so all I'm trying to do is extrapolate the arc from about 5 minutes of screentime. Â Their arc has to end with Ramsay being raised from the ranks of a bastard to become a Bolton properly. Â It sets an important precedent for Jon when Stannis offers him Winterfell. Â Yara could well be his 'reward' for good behaviour.
Â 
Theon though would become expendable to Bolton as soon as Yara has had a child.Â

4669	Mos	2014-05-05	Here's my prediction of what will become of Yara this season:
Â 
4.06: Yara leads the attack on the Dreadfort, meets Theon and realizes he's a very changed man, before she's forced to retreat.Â 
4.07: Yara and the surviving Ironborns go to Moat Cailin, learns from Ralf Kenning that Balon is dead and decides to return to the Iron Islands.
4.10: When she returns home, she learns that Euron is planning to crown himself king and in order to stop him, she calls for a kingsmoot. That way, Damphair can easily be cut.Â
4670	AlienTwo	2014-05-05	From the previews I'm pretty sure the fighting takes place at Moat Cailin, not the Dreadfort.

No, they're clearly at the Dreadfort.Â  You can see Yara sailing down the Weeping Water.
4672	Guard of the Rainking	2014-05-05	From the previews I'm pretty sure the fighting takes place at Moat Cailin, not the Dreadfort.


No. Take a look at this.Â That's definitely the Dreadfort.
4673	King Tommen	2014-05-05	From the previews I'm pretty sure the fighting takes place at Moat Cailin, not the Dreadfort.


Â 
Why are people saying this? The Dreadfort sets are the exact same as what you see in the previews. Also, if you look at the 0:04 second mark of the preview, you'll clearly see Yara with her Ironborn at one end of the hallway and Theon is right beside her (presumably after she frees him). Then at the other end of the hallway, you've got shirtless Ramsay with his men smiling before charging at her.
Â 
It's not Moat Cailin, and it's stupid for people to continue saying this.
4674	AlienTwo	2014-05-05	You both have proven me wrong.Â  Good work... I thought I had it nailed...

Then at the other end of the hallway, you've got shirtless Ramsay with his men smiling before charging at her.
Â 
It's not Moat Cailin, and it's stupid for people to continue saying this.

That's pretty harsh, dude. I didn't notice Theon in that scene, so it's legit that I would assume they're following the source material. Having pointed out that he is in a scene with Yara, you have definitely cleared things up, but I don't think it's fair to say that it's stupid for people to speculate (differently/incorrectly?) on something none of us have seen
4677	Daenerys Must Die	2014-05-05	That would certainly be interesting. Would make the Kingsmoot a lot more interesting for the unsullied, since they've gotten to know Yara more during this season.


Â 
Â Agreed.. also keeps from having to cast new faces until S5 - and we're losing a lot so adding 1 or both of the uncles, Aegon & Jon Con to tie into already existing plots wouldn't be overly far fetched. The latter is more likely but I'm hoping for at least one of the Greyjoy's (would be Euron I guess..)

Agreed.Â  Especially in a story this nebulous and with this depth of complexity, a lot of stuff is getting thrown against a wall to see what sticks over time.

Â 
I apologize, I went a little overboard there. I just get frustrated sometimes having to explain things over and over and it feels like I'm talking to the same person continuously when that's obviously not the case and it's just one person bringing up an observation for the first time.
Â 
I would love if we had a "What we know for sure" thread stickied to every episode sub-forum and that way people coming in could take a look and see what's been deduced by the many posters who have been tracking the footage, interviews and clues over a long period of time. It would help everyone get up to speed before diving into the other chats.
4680	kjm16216	2014-05-05	Agree with the theory Theon runs back to Ramsay.Â  He's a broken man.

That is a very good idea... it would make these discussions a lot more concise, because I agree that I keep reading similar wrong comments (mine on occasion not withstanding).
Â 
OT: I like the ideas being tossed around about the Kingsmoost and how they are going to skip the Damphair... I'm excited to get to meet more Iron Born, and Balon needs to die.Â  Soon.
4682	Weeping Sore	2014-05-05	Â 
It wouldn't make sense to use Yar(ash)a, as she is not the right age, hasn't grown up in Winterfell, knows anything about Northern culture, and any Ironborn would recognize her. A random Northern girl would be better for the job.


Â 
The Yara as bride of Ramsay scenario has nothing whateverÂ to do with her passing for Arya, but rather as a way for the Boltons to expand their influence, i.e.,Â The North + Iron Islands.
Â 
I'm guessing an FM bumps off Balon at the behest of the Iron Bank (now in bed with King Stannis).
4683	Guard of the Rainking	2014-05-05	Â

For a long time I thought that Yara would take the Dreadfort while the majority of the Bolton forces were at Moat Cailan, and that would replace Deepwood Motte in the season 5 storyline. But now I don't see there being anyway Yara can simultaneously take the Dreadfort and let Roose, Ramsay and Theon escape with a large host of men. Yara escaping to Moat Cailan and heading to the kings... I'm sorry quuensmoot would be the best way to go about it IMO. Also Ramsay just killing Yara or torturing Yara or even claiming that Yara is fake Arya would be stupid.

Cheers. 
That would be a helpful thread, in fact. I get most (all?) of my info from the incredible observations of fellow posters here, so I think you're on to something with that idea. Not sure if it's feasible, though. 
Back on topic.... I can see Tyrion's trial spanning 2 episodes, not just ep. 6. That would help to show the enormity and gravity of it. The synopsis for episode 7 shows that Tyrion gets Oberyn's help, but that only happens after Tyrion sees what a sham the trial is, and chooses trial-by-combat in from of the jury. It would take quite the suspension of disbelief if Tyrion's whole trial is in one episode, after which he goes straight for trial-by-combat. Especially since Bronn is no longer by his side.

I think is we had a thread for each episode pinned in the episodes sub-forum, that would be very usable.Â  Maybe a larger one for the show theories (confirmed) in general as well....

Bronn actually hasn't left his side at this point, and the idea of a trial by combat hasn't even been raised, nor Cersei's using Gregor Clegane as a deterrent.Â  Also, from the preview videos, it looked like Tyrion was making his "guilty of being a dwarf" speech in episode 6.
Â 
I've actually be suspecting that the show's version of events is going to be Tyrion declaring he wants a trial by combat, on the understanding that Bronn will champion him, at which point Cersei announces that she will be appointing Gregor, which leads to Bronn backing off, and then Oberyn volunteering in episode 7.

Wow. Kick a man while he's down, eh? Your version would certainly be brutal for viewing audiences 
Did Pod say something about Bronn not being allowed to have contact with Tyrion, though? He might just be absent from the whole trial.I could do that with this thread, actually. I could just separate concrete info from my speculation, but we don't know 100% if the info is concrete, do we?

I believe some posters have brought up the point that there is some 'evidence' of certain things, based on the promos, foreshadowings, and trailers. For example, an image of Reek beside Yara, which, if users (myself) had seen, would have been less likely to speculate Reek to already be at Moat Cailin.
4690	King Tommen	2014-05-05	Edit: I edited the OP to separate concrete info from my personal speculation. Not sure if that's exactly what you and all the others wanted.


Â 
That'll work, I think you've broken it down quite nicely there. Not sure how many people will take the time to go back there for your edits but it's a nice summary of what we know at this point. Once the "Previously On" clip surfaces later this week, we'll have more info we can use.
4691	Ser Blake	2014-05-05	I'm expecting an acting tour de force from the Lannister clan in this episode.Â  Leana and Peter have been killing it all season long, and I think they will shine in this episode with all of the meaty trial material.Â  I think Charles and Nikolaj will have some great moments as well.
Â 
My hopes are sky high for this episode.Â  Hopefully it can live up to them.
4692	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-05	So I can seeÂ this Jorah/Daenerys dialogue being this episode, right before (or after?) holding court:
Â 
It's..tempting, to see your enemies as evil, but there's good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought.
Let the priests argue over good and evil. They have a choice. They can live in my new world, or they can die in their old one.
Â 
Evidence: Dany's hair in the January trailer + Dany's hair in Episode 6 preview (+ same dress??)
Â 
What about Littlefinger's dialogue from Trailer #1? "Given the opportunity, what do we do to those who hurt the ones we love?" and "I want to know which side you're on." Two different scenes? Is he talking to Sansa in the first and Lysa in the other? Maybe the second is a Lord Declarant.

					
					
							Edited by Zombies That Were Promised, 05 May 2014 - 02:42 PM.
4693	Seneti	2014-05-05	Prediction for Sansa :
Â 
She will skip episode 6.
Â 
In episode 7 we will meet the Lord Declarants (Waynwood...) plotting with / against Littlefinger. It will be, imo, the introduction episode to the politics of the Vale.
Â 
Skip episode 8 and 9.
Â 
And we all know what'd be in 10 !


Â 
Exactly how I picture it as well.
Â 
As for KL: I think we'll get all of Tyrion's trial by judge, followed by Jaime complaining that the trail is a farce and ending with Tyrion demanding trial by combat. Given that the mountain will have to appear in ep. 4.07, we'll probably also get Cersei naming him as crown's champion.
Â 
As for Yasha, Theon and Ramsay: I don't have the slightest clue how they are going to resolve this situation, so I'll just sit back and enjoy the surprise. I like surprises, particularly the ones that make Book Walkers blow a gasketÂ
4694	Rhaegar I Targaryen	2014-05-05	Why does anyone think Bronn would champion Tyrion against the Mountain? Or even consider it?Â 
Â 
His character has been expanded, that is true, but he's still the same guy. No way in hell he does. Bronn has made it known on a couple occasions that it is the gold keeping him around.Â
4695	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-05-05	Anyone else confused at how late the gift of mercy will happen?
Â 
Hound's "death" is in episode eight, apparently, and Arya is MIA from episode six, apparently, so Hound teaches it to her in episode seven, one episode before the moment where it is very significant. I thought it was gonna be in episode three, since the shot in the trailers looks like Riverlands (and they are now in Vale country, it looks like).

Is it confirmed Arya isn't in episode six?Â  I agree, nevertheless, that she's probably got three appearances left:Â  episode 6 or 7 (the gift of mercy), episode 8 (Bloody Gate, something "kills" the Hound), episode 10 (leaving on a slow boat to Braavos).

Playing Devil's Advocate, despite Tyrion's new place within the Lannister Clan, I'm sure he still has access to a pile of gold and could offer to pay Bronn even more cash if he championed him.Â  Of course this is all before the Mountain is chosen as "opposing counsel".
4698	Rhaegar I Targaryen	2014-05-05	I wonder if they'll have him enter the throne room when Cersei declares him the champion, would be sweet to see Oberyn's reaction.Â
4699	Ser Blake	2014-05-05	I wonder if they'll have him enter the throne room when Cersei declares him the champion, would be sweet to see Oberyn's reaction.Â 


Â 
Honestly this would be the perfect way to end this episode.Â  Have Tyrion ask for a trial by combat, thinking Bronn would fight for him, only to have Cersei announce her champion as the Mountain while he walks in looking massive and intimidating as hell.Â  It would be great to see the intant facial reactions from Tryrion, Bronn, Oberyn, and Cersei if this were to happen.
4700	Konradsmith	2014-05-05	We know that there is a scene where Arya and the Hound stumble across a dying man because we saw as much in the Foreshadowing feature. And its in the Vale because AryaÂ discovers him after climbing over a rocky area.Â We also know from the weapons and training featurette that the Hound will lecture to her that "men kill with steel." Also she'll find out that Joffrey dies because Maisie says in an interview that Arya says that she "would have killed him withÂ a chickenbone."

4702	Konradsmith	2014-05-05	I think they're supposed to be in the Vale now though. So they couldn't find him in the Riverlands because they're not there anymore and they're not turning back like they did in the books because the Inn fight has already happened.

Thanks. It looked like Riverlands to me, so I thought it would happen earlier this season and it's been confusing me ever since I didn't see it in episode three. I read Maisie's interview, yes. Wondering how Arya will find out. From the dying man, or from the Knight of the Gate? People at Saltpans (or show equivalent)?
Â 
Interesting that every one of Maisie's scenes this season (save for the spoilerific stuff at the end) has been glimpsed in the trailers/promos/interviews. We knew everything going in, but we didn't know it.
4705	Konradsmith	2014-05-05	I'm just trying to figure out if the killing of the dying guy will be in ep. six, seven or eight. The only thingÂ I have to go on really is whether Arya's line about nothingness, "nothing isn't better or worse than anything, nothing is just nothing" (from the Foreshadowing seems to be more D and D-written or Cogman-written. Which I haven't figured out yet.

Â 
I'm guessing episode 7, with the Hound being wounded and left behind in episode 8.
4707	Mordos_Kull	2014-05-05	It would be nice for Arya and the Hound to run into a Vale Hill Tribe, who are like: "Hey dudes. You haven't seen a Halfman on your travels? Only, he did promise us the Vale, and we feel kinda short changed, that we haven't got it yet."
4708	Arkash	2014-05-05	It would be nice for Arya and the Hound to run into a Vale Hill Tribe, who are like: "Hey dudes. You haven't seen a Halfman on your travels? Only, he did promise us the Vale, and we feel kinda short changed, that we haven't got it yet."


Â 
Either the Hill Tribes either the Knights of the Bloody Gate.Â 
Â 
They are definitly in the Vale now (this was shot in Iceland and it feels different from Ireland, I love this little subtlety).Â 
Â 
Whatever happens, there are many good possibilities for the Hound's wound.Â 
Â 
A raid by the Hill Clans could be quite intense and great cinematography (looking forward to see those dusk Vale shot of Arya training we've seen in the trailers).
But something going fucking completely wrong at the Bloody Gate could be a great scene as well.
4709	King Tommen	2014-05-05	But something going fucking completely wrong at the Bloody Gate could be a great scene as well.


Â 
I'm pretty certain that LF giving the long exposition to Sansa about the nature of the dangers of the Bloody Gate and showing all the soldiers lining the pass was meant to foreshadow something going wrong for the Hound and Arya when they try to make their way in.

My main issue with that is that given what we've seen of the Gate, with archers lining the entire length of it, if they actually got as far as the Gate itself, I would find it hard to buy them getting out.
Â 
If Lysa dies in episode 7, as some are speculating, Arya and the Hound would arrive at the Eyrie's gates to find Lysa dead, which would seem to kill any impetus to take her there, unless the Hound is contemplating selling her to Littlefinger.
4711	Konradsmith	2014-05-05	I hope when they sail under the Titan's skirt Stan looks up unimpressed and says, "His balls are smaller than mine."
4712	Daenor	2014-05-05	I wonder if Shae will appear at this one. If they want to give shocking moments for the viewers though i believe that will see both Shae and Bronn betraying Tyrion in the next episode.Also Tyrion's trial by combat is at episode 8 so does this mean his trial will be expanded to episode 7 as well?
4713	Konradsmith	2014-05-05	^Some of the trailers have featured a reaction shot from Tyrion, a contrazoom of him watching someone enter the courtroom. He looks floored to see this person coming in. That would be Shae, I presume. So yeah, that'll be this episode.
4714	King Tommen	2014-05-05	Massive Shae heel turn FTW! The show has set this up to be even more of a shocker than the books. Not only has it been established that she has real feelings for Tyrion but she's also assumed to be safely dispatched from King's Landing. Cersei presenting her as the star witness is going to be a jaw dropper.

I believe the Unsullied will get some nasty surprises next Sunday.Truth is that they gave them a few clues to prepare for Shae's betrayal.Especially the scene where Tywin demands to bring her to his tower.I'm really excited about this one.If written correctly it will be a hell of an episode

4717	scolbert08	2014-05-05	My guess is that Yara is captured by Ramsay, who then trades her to the Ironborn for Moat Cailin.
4718	Hath4	2014-05-05	But why would he send reek in to negotiate the surrender. If he does capture her I think he may be part of his offer to the ironborn but he will betray them and keep yara. if she is even captured she will stay a captive into season 5.
4719	Conchobar	2014-05-05	My guess is that Yara is captured by Ramsay, who then trades her to the Ironborn for Moat Cailin.


No man, Moat Cailin needs to play out exactly like it did in the books, Theon rides in, convinces them to surrender, and then they all get flayed. I really hope they do not deviate too much away from that.

Â 
I think it's a valid story arc, but it wouldn't work. The Greyjoys were chosen by the ironborn as their liege lords after Harren the Black was defeated by Aegon. With Balon dead the main branch of house Greyjoy is no longer strong as it once was. That's what the Kingsmoot was all about. If they put blood above strenght Asha would've inherited the throne and nobody would've said anything.
Â 
Having Yara as a hostage wouldn't give the Boltons any real advantage. Unless Ramsey only wants another toy for his Kraken playset.
4722	WTFSalami	2014-05-05	Â 
YARA: "Theon what are you doing?"
Â 
THEON: "My name is Reek. It rhymes with weak."
Ugh that would be heart-breaking.
4723	Daenor	2014-05-05	They might want Yara as hostage(i mean the writers) and than exchanged in order to undermine her efforts at the Kingsmoot.As readers we are better aware of how the Ironborn society works but this will probably work better for the viewersÂ  so they might understand that might is all that matters with them.Yara who failed her task and was captured can't be the best candidate asÂ  the next leader of the most badass people on Westeros,especially when they have the choice of a most legendary raider who comes from the ruins of Valyria carrying precious treasure and a freaking magic horn.
4724	robdavies1775	2014-05-05	I think those streaks of blood we see on Reek may not be from fighting with the ironborn. It's possible that he has some sort of blood fetish and gets Myranda to cut him as they're having sex...Â

Well in an earlier promo, we also see Myranda slap him. Sociopath that he is, he could use that as a reason to butcher her.Â 
Â 
Not that he would even need one, he's a loose cannon.Â

Â 
Yeah, the makeup looks better in the promo, but it's too hard to tell without context.
4732	Rhaegar I Targaryen	2014-05-05	I'm really excited for the Dreadfort scene, Iwan and Alfie are top notch actors IMO.Â 
Â 
This should be a cool adaptation, albeit a creepy one.Â
4733	Blackfish is a badass	2014-05-05	Anyone think by the title of episode and the undertone meanings of the titles that we will see lady stoneheart in this episode? It's just a crazy thought. One of the storylines that I'm most looking forward to. 
Last episode they spent a lot of time with pod and Brienne. I don't see any direction the show goes where those two don't run into uncat.
4734	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-05	A LSH speculation for each remaining episode:
Â 
-By all the Laws of Gods and Men, Lady Catelyn shouldn't be alive.
-Lady Catelyn is a "Mockingbird" of the beauty she once was to Baelish.
-Lady Catelyn is The Mountain and the Viper (because mountains are made of stone, and vipers are poisoned in the heart with vengeance).
-She is the Watcher on the Wall, because if she had just loved Jon Snow none of this would have ever happened.
-She is The Children, because take your pick.
4735	Seneti	2014-05-06	Why does anyone think Bronn would champion Tyrion against the Mountain? Or even consider it?Â 
Â 
His character has been expanded, that is true, but he's still the same guy. No way in hell he does. Bronn has made it known on a couple occasions that it is the gold keeping him around.Â 


Â 
I don't think anybody here is suggesting that Bronn would champion Tyrion, but that Tyrion will HOPE Bronn will consider it. Which he won't of course. He's made it perfectly clear that he's not Tyrion's friend and not his toady.
Â 


Â 
I'm pretty certain that LF giving the long exposition to Sansa about the nature of the dangers of the Bloody Gate and showing all the soldiers lining the pass was meant to foreshadow something going wrong for the Hound and Arya when they try to make their way in.


Â 
Agreed.
Â 


My main issue with that is that given what we've seen of the Gate, with archers lining the entire length of it, if they actually got as far as the Gate itself, I would find it hard to buy them getting out.


Â 
Good point though...
Â 
Â 
Â 
Also something that seems to be strangely absent from this thread: what do you think the title alludes to? My thoughts would be:
- Tyrion's trial (obvious choice, as he's being charged and tried by the laws of gods and men for kinslaying and kingslaying)
- Stannis invoking that the throne is his by the laws of gods and men
- possibly Yasha considering what Ramsay did to Theon an insult/affront to gods and men
- Dany passing out judgment according to the laws of gods and men?
4736	Konradsmith	2014-05-06	^I think that phrase will be invoked at the trial.

Â 
I think he is his friend in the show. Sure he still cares about gold, but he is fond of Tyrion and they are close. But they can easily make him just like in this book with one thing - if it turns out he participated in getting Shae there and lied to Tyrion about her being gone. Shae and Bronn betrayal would be a double blow for Tyrion.

4738	Carl Drogo	2014-05-06	I'm actually hoping the Iron Bank denies Stannis then is forced to back him next season.


This.Â  The Iron Bank has no reason at this point to back Stannis and every reason to continue to believe that the Westeros Throne is a faithful debtor. Also, if Stannis gets his credit (i.e. armies) then and there, there's no reason to take the detour to the wall. It makes sense that the bank will blow him off.Â  Then, after Cersei has blown off the bank in her arrogant way, perhaps next season, the bank will get back to Stannis.
Â 
I always liked the storyline involving the bank and loved Tycho Nestoris turning up much later in the books in a very unexpected place to show how serious the bank is about its business. Therefore I like the fact that they are already enhancing this storyline now.

Except that the current holders of the Iron Throne owe them millions with no way to get it back.Â  It's been said the "Iron Bank will have it's due" and you can't repay the gold you owe, they will take payment in blood.Â  Putting Stannis on the Throne could work out well for them, in fact, Stannis is the kind of dude who might even pay back his brothers debts... as well as his own.

It would be even better if the Bank will offer Stannis money if he attacks King's Landing. Leave Stannis' choice as a cliffhanger, and then we'll truly have a king who cared moment at the end of the season.
"I was trying to win the throne to save the kingdom, when I should have trying to save the kingdom to win the throne"
And the Unsullied will flock to him, just as they flocked to Dany at the end of season 3.

4742	Onion Seaworth	2014-05-06	Seeing how they are changing stuff from the books... I am completley terrified that Ramsay is going to die..... I really hope not since I like ramsay and Roose both in the books and the shoe, And I think Iwans portrayal although a bit diffrent is 3 times better with his more Joker esque madness he shows in the show.
And I really love Ramsay and Reek interaction adn I look forward to alot of Ramsay/Roose talks and dialouges.
Â 
But as I said I am so terrified Ramsay will die and when asha/yara runs away with theon and gets captured by stannis in a future episode.
Â 
So if D&D kills ramsay I will be more heartbroken then I was during the Red wedding and ned starks execution together... (or something similair.)
Â
4743	Konradsmith	2014-05-06	They won't kill Ramsay. They're doing Moat Caillin and having him reunite with his daddy later in the season. I'd be more worried for Yara(sha), though I doubt she'll die too, she's more likely to bite it than Ramsay. I think we can all agree though that Myranda is doomed.

4751	The Lizard King	2014-05-06	Â 
And after that he flees to Essos, puts on a few hundred pounds and presents himself to Dany as Strong Belwas. Oh yeah, I can totally see this happening.


Â
4752	shiola	2014-05-06	When will Tyrion get turned down by Bronn?
Â 
Bronn and Tyrion are super close in the show. Â That's going to be a shock to the audience


Â 
Eh. Â He went out of his way last season to literally state, "I'm a sellsword. Â I sell my sword. Â I don't go loaning it out to friends as a favor." Â In the books he doesn't fight, I believe, because he's given Lollys and some gold and a house? Â The show will probably give him the gold and a house; maybe a wife. Â Tyrion can't offer him anything. Â It's no surprise that someone like Bronn would choose to not defend him, and Tyrion won't blame him.
4753	Epyon	2014-05-07	I'm actually hoping the Iron Bank denies Stannis then is forced to back him next season.


Â 
Â

Â 
This seems the most likely to me as well... At least from the Iron Bank's perspective...
Â 
The problem with this theory, is when you look at it from Stannis' perspective... If the Ironbank doesn't support him now, I can't see him ever forgiving them later, when they do come hat in hand... Stannis really seems more like the type who would take over the 7kingdoms, then burn the bank to the ground for not backing him when they had the chance. It'll be very interesting to see how the show handles this.
Â 
Switching gears:
As far as the Ironborn plot line is concerned: Theon still looks too much like Theon...His sister isn't supposed to recognize him when she first sees him again... I think Reek will be left with Roose Bolton, while Ramsey is up at the Dreadfort building his army to assault Moat Cailin. Theons sister may meet Ramsey, but I don't think there's any chance she meets "Reek" just yet. All of this Ironborn stuff is probably useless filler until Balon dies, anyhow.
Â 
The High Septon Crowning Tommen was also curious: They haven't nearly started setting up the Faith's role for later in the books/show, and by having the High Septon crown Tommen, they missed one of the biggest chances to do so. After all, the lack of blessing by the faith, combined with massive debts of the crown is exactly why they where allowed to recreate their own army... and where they effectively get enough power to arrest Marge, and Cersei later on. Very curious to see where they go with this/how they get the Faith into the mix (and where the hell the Faith's plot line is even headed in the books)
Â 
EDIT:
Â 
My predictions:
This episode will be mostly about Tyrion's trial and culminate with him declaring Trial by combat, when it's clear he's screwed if he doesn't. And him trying to name Bronn.
Â 
E07: "Mockingbird": Seems likely to involve Lyssa getting moon door'd, with the subplot of "Who is Tyrion going to get to fight for him, after Bronn refuses"
Â 
E08: "The Mountain and the Viper" Seems obvious enough.

He will probably be turned down. Then, when Cersei refuses to pay them in season five, they'll go back to Stannis. Or maybe they'll circumvent all of that and just finance Stannis from the get go (that would take some convincing from Stannis, which ideally means an awesome speech written by Bryan Cogman, so I'm all for that lol).Who is the guy with Tycho Nestoris?Noho Dimittis?

4771	boojam	2014-05-07	Across the Narrow Sea: Daenerys treats with supplicants (probably Hizdahr and some Great Masters). Drogon is featured in the promo, but we don't exactly know what he's doing. It 's possible Drogon will kill Hazzea and the goatherd will bring Dany her bones (I thought this would happen much later - guess she'll be struggling with what to do with her dragons across several episodes).Now Dany's story gets tricky.One thing I sort of suspected the taking of Meereen would not happen until E5, that money would be spent on the Unsullied assault on the Meereen gate , brief VFX expense, but thought it would be affordable. Guess not.The whole battle is told in retrospect on the page.REALLY abbreviated on the show!But we have a bigger battle to come, so it goes.Now though the Prince Quentyn Martell story is almost closed loop, except for it being GRRM ploy to loose Viserion and Rhaegal, (Boy! does that go wrong, seems the Princes of Dorne do stupid things in different ways, anybody at Dorne with any snap!) Still I liked the Quentyn story. The siege of Meereen (actually the 2nd siege of Meereen!) starts , that could be jazzed up.Now, I am one who like GRRM's story telling , and even tho Dany is going loop-d-loop most of the book, I was entertained.But translate that to visual narrative, o man!, I don't know, for season 5 Dave and Dan are going to have a lot of inventing to do. I am guessing season 5 Daznak's Pit is the zinger in E9... but don't hold me to it.Before that I don't know, puzzled.

4787	TheWeepingMan	2014-05-07	We will see a scene with the Mountain killing people either in Ep. 6 or 7. We have seen a scene from the trailer where he is "topless" and I doubt that he'll take his armour off during the fight with Oberyn.

so makes me think that after this scene she's under the impression that Theon is dead...then sails away to Pyke to find out Balon is dead too...then its sort of an "oh shit" moment where we're left wondering what's gona happen next

Just realized that book burners don't know he's the viper, ergo they don't know the meaning of The Mountain and the Viper show title.

i wasn't sure if they named him Viper yet or not...so I just told all my Unsullied friends to avoid learning the ep names...i did that as soon as i saw e8 name lol!Â

i've been dying for that as well...it's becoming such a habit for me to call them by their names, when i'm talking to any of my unsullied friends, all just are like..."who?Â   "
Â 
ok so whats covered this ep...
yara/ramsay ofcourse (has its own thread)
glimpse of bravos (assuming thats the big statue)
stannis/IB
Jaime/Tywin possible confrontation
Dany ruling in meereenÂ 
DROGONÂ  Â  Â  Â  
Tyrion's trial
Â 
stannis scene pretty predictable what they gona show...though would be curious to see if they leave it as cliffy rather than definitive answer...
extremely excited for progress of Trial...and Drogon
Â 
but also curious how far they going to take Dany scene

Yes.Â  We originally used the term for a small, rather fanatically unspoiled group that posted over at TWoP (now at PTV), but now we pretty much use it to mean anyone who hasn't read the books.Â  If you're interested, look in the General section for the TWoP/PTV Unsullied thread.

i know the feeling...i've resorted to almost always saying the opposite....while watching purple wedding, my brother commented how he's really liking Oberyn which means he'll probably die...i had to just laugh and tell him that no Dorne is pretty important in future...then when he saw the scene with Tywin and heard how Dorne successfully fought of Aegon the Conqueror's attack, he's now fully convinced of some epic battle between Oberyn and DanyÂ  Â Â

4806	Konradsmith	2014-05-07	Â trgrn-strk-lnstr-mrtell, Lhara as played by Sarine Sofair (a model and actress) will appear this week, alongside Anoushka Kellett (a model, whose name I've likely misspelled) and Samantha Bentley (a porn girl). They filmed together in September, which I know because they all tweeted one another after this and Ours is the Fury on wicnet informed everyone this on one of her casting pages. Lhara sounds to be an eastern name, and since Samantha Bentley tweeted Liam Cunningham around that time and said it was great to work with him, I assume that Davos will find himself on a pleasure barge in Braavos, maybe where he's located Saan to negotiate with his old pirate bud.
Â 
For as good an episode as 406 is shaping up to be it may be somewhat overstuffed with nudity. (We've also got Charlotte Hope and potentially Carice van Houten). I hope the "plot" doesn't distract from that plot this time around.

4807	Hath4	2014-05-07	agree, do we really need naked ladies in braavos. al least with myrannda it seems it will actually lead some where probablly her death but hey serves more purpose than brothel scene will
4808	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-07	I've never had a problem with nudity, except the Littlefinger scene back in Season 1 was just over the top and something I felt I'd see out of True Blood (which is why I don't have a problem with nudity in GoT..True Blood is just gratuitous in comparison, like 3 sex scenes each episode) There was anÂ entire town having an orgy as..part of the plot, actually.. in someone's front yard in that show. GoT just has nudity as if it's whatever, because nudity is.
Â 
Nudity in GoT just gets lighter every season. This year so far we've only had 2 Oberyn scenes (3 minutes long each?) and 2 scenes with background boobs at Mole's Town and Craster's (30 seconds?). So about 7-8 min in ~275 minutes of television. That's about the rate I felt when reading.

4810	Konradsmith	2014-05-07	^They call them courtesans over there. I theorized on another page that Anoushka Kellett is the Black Pearl. Other posters theorized that these girls would likely be seen again in season five once Arya goes there.

We ALWAYS need naked ladies.
Â 
....Just kidding. I do like Konradsmith's spec that these ladies will be playing Braavosi courtesans and will reappear in Arya's arc, though. It would set the stage nicely for future storylines.
4812	Arkash	2014-05-07	I actually do really wonder what Stannis arc will be made of this ep ?
Â 
I think we will probably have a first scene of departure from Dragonstone.

Arrival at Braavos. Meeting with Iron Bank.

I wonder where Davos, the ladies and Salladhor will appear in all that.
4813	Konradsmith	2014-05-07	^There's been no indication that Salladhor actually will return btw, that's just conjecture on my part. And wishful thinking.

Â 
Yeah, I know we have nothing about Sallador's eventual return but as I really wish to see him as well, I mentionned him.
Â 
I have no idea how the bathtub scene would fit into this and what it would be about. Any spec ?
4816	Konradsmith	2014-05-07	Well there was a shot of Mel reclining in a tub in the "in weeks ahead" promo that has leaked online from HBO Go. And Carice referred to it in an interview and brought up the different powders that Mel has, one that makes men lustful etc.
4817	Arkash	2014-05-07	Now I have the image of Mel trying to seduce Mycroft Holmes that way in my head ! ^^
Â 
She might probably share this scene with Stannis but I dont see the point. He's already convinced. It wouldnt make a difference to Davos. But what if it was the way she seduces Salladhor Saan back into Camp Stannis...

Â 
I always had the sense that Stannis was a puppet of Mel, or at least a pawn of her. Â Until, that is, he attacked the Wall. Â I thought he grew into his own shell then. Â 
Â 
Back to the OP though: Â 
Â 
I don't think "Yara" will be captured by Ramsay. Â I know the show canon and book canon are different, but I think if she's caught by Ramsay, she will certainly be tortured gruesomely. Â I think that would derail her character, and ruin her story. Â 
Â 
I'm wondering when Jorah will be exiled, but I don't think it'll happen until later. Â They always end every season with her, and I think that's the last "big" thing to happen to her in ASoS.
Â 
I think the trial will be only one episode. Â At least the meat of it. Â Shae will appear again, and testify against him. Â I'm not sure how the show will portray that, since they've made her, at least in my opinion, a stronger character than in the books. Â I can't wait for that.
Â 
I can't wait to see Bravos. Â I love how the show re-creates the locations. Â The way I pictured them when I first started reading, compared to when I saw them realized, well...let's just say I have faith.

I always had the sense that Stannis was a puppet of Mel, or at least a pawn of her. Â Until, that is, he attacked the Wall. Â I thought he grew into his own shell then. Â 
I have to disagree with that he is never at any point a puppet to Mel in the books he is using her as much as she is him.
4835	Dany's Silver	2014-05-07	I hope when they sail under the Titan's skirt Stan looks up unimpressed and says, "His balls are smaller than mine."



Â 
I am keen to see what they do with this early introduction (as far as the books go) of the Iron Bank. I had always thought to see Braavos first through Arya's eyes in the show, and I wonder how the timeline will be adjusted for ADWD... This feels like another butterfly effect (from my perspective).
4836	franko99	2014-05-07	Yeah that's odd, so far monikers like that have been mentioned early.


Olenna already leave King's Landing, and she was never called the "Queen of Thorns"Â
4837	Konradsmith	2014-05-07	They have to call him the Viper at some point I'd imagine, given it's part of the title for episode eight.
4838	Thelastactionhero	2014-05-07	I have to disagree with that he is never at any point a puppet to Mel in the books he is using her as much as she is him.


I can buy into the idea that Mel has an unnatural hold over him following Black Water Bay, just not to the degree they've depicted him. He's still a very principled man, despite losing almost everything, and it shows when rejects proposals to do needlessly cruel things that might have been to his benefit, like massacring Crack Claw Point. The determining factor will be how they portray Stannis from this episode going forward. The time to show his darkside has been more than sufficient with the deviations they've taken. Now it's time to see some good stuff, and show the Unsullied that he's more than a power hungry pawn of the Red Woman.
4839	SheRa Seastar	2014-05-08	Â 
I think he is his friend in the show. Sure he still cares about gold, but he is fond of Tyrion and they are close. But they can easily make him just like in this book with one thing - if it turns out he participated in getting Shae there and lied to Tyrion about her being gone. Shae and Bronn betrayal would be a double blow for Tyrion.

Maybe Bronn doesn't get the chance to decline,  when Tyrion asks for trial by combat, Cersei could agree and bring in the mountain,  then Oberyn could see his chance for revenge and volunteer to be Tyrion's champion?

I remember seeing those pics -- I wonder if they could be Oberyn? Interestingly, the person's/dummy's face isn't shown.
True, these images don't reflect the book's combat sequences, but that isn't really relevant, as it hardly needs to be said that the show doesn't religiously follow the books.
Why else would The Mountain be fighting between now and episode 7?

These scenes take place in episode seven when the Mountain kills people by the city walls while Cersei looks on. It is known.

 Â that is pretty much exactly what i was hoping to see end of 7th episodeÂ 
Â 
i feel like this episode name is going to be mentioned in Tyrions trial but is going to refer to Stannis and his claim that he is the one true king "by all the laws of Gods and Men" so i'm wondering if the ending of the ep will be the IB agreeing to bankroll him and him walking out with Davos with a determined expression or talking about KL...
Â

 Â that is pretty much exactly what i was hoping to see end of 7th episodeÂ 
Â 
i feel like this episode name is going to be mentioned in Tyrions trial but is going to refer to Stannis and his claim that he is the one true king "by all the laws of Gods and Men" so i'm wondering if the ending of the ep will be the IB agreeing to bankroll him and him walking out with Davos with a determined expression or talking about KL...

Interesting take.Â 
Â 
I like how we have to think about things now, before it was predicting where in the books the show will get, now it's predicting what they are going to do, what they might make up or leave out.Â  It's very enthralling to play games like this.Â

i stopped that after House of Undying ep...that was the moment when i realized show's gona do its own thing, and its been a MUCH MUCH more fun game prediction what they are going to do and howÂ

Agreed, that one was a shocker/bummer.Â  I was so psyched for that scene, but what we got wasn't what I was waiting for.Â  All in all though, I love the twists and turns.Â  For the most part.
4856	LilJonUmber	2014-05-08	Â 
I am keen to see what they do with this early introduction (as far as the books go) of the Iron Bank. I had always thought to see Braavos first through Arya's eyes in the show, and I wonder how the timeline will be adjusted for ADWD... This feels like another butterfly effect (from my perspective).


Â 
My guess is Stannis' request is denied, as they still hope the crown will pay its large debt. Tycho will meet with Cersei, she'll be a moron and summarily dismiss him and the IB, which will lead to Tycho seeking out Stannis in the North to grant his request.Â

Â 
Well, she'll work from the newfound knowledge that the Lannisters have no stockpile of riches to pay the IB. Â I think they'll de-emphasize the capriciousness of her decision, and let viewers think she had no choice.
4859	titanx5	2014-05-08	I think the IB might back Stannis, as it is implied through out the series that he doesnt have any men, I know in the books he has like 1500 men which isn't many at all. But remember they are also making the Wildlings to have a much greater number than in the books, and making the NW a lot weaker. So I think they will supply Stannis with like 5000-10000 men. To make the viewers think he might have a chance to attack KL, and then to their surprise he comes with his new 'army' and defeats the wildlings. Could be wrong but we will know soon

Why on earth does everyone here think this? Stannis decided to turn north last season and told Davos the only reason he hasn't left yet is he doesn't have enough men. He's not still weighing his options. He's just gathering an Army and he also needs more ships since Salladhor Saan is still not on his side for now. Assuming show-watchers are paying any attention at all, they know Stannis's plans because he explicitly laid them out. He's seeking a loan to buy men and ships in order to head north, get away from the War of Five Kings that "means nothing" and fight the "only enemy that matters."Â

Did everyone just forget this happened? Death is marching on the wall and he's the only person who can stop it, but first he needs Davos to bring lords to his side and hire sellswords and pirates.

Wow, calm down.
Â 
Many Unsullied don't remember that Mhysa scene. Hell, I had some people tell me they have no clue who Jon Arryn was after last episode aired. You are overestimating people's memory here.
Â 
The scene in 4x03 already set them up to think of KL - with Stannis getting so worked up that Joffrey is dead but he has no army, so he can't do anything about it. Rewatch the scene, it is implied he wants to take the Throne because his 'claim will be forgotten'.
Â 
They are trying to make it as surprising as it can be for non book readers. It's fairly evident considering that the only shots of his army in trailers are hard to identify, unless you pause it and look at the banners.

Do you really think they make it so obvious he'll go to the Wall this episode ? Let's keep the surprise ! The whole point of not reminding us of his destination this season is to confuse viewers.

Â 
Precisely. If they didn't care about surprise factor they would have added much more to trailers. I'm loving them throwing in KL red herring - that will make everything more effective.
4866	Arkash	2014-05-08	Speaking about the Stannis arc, let's throw a spec around here : what do you think Melissandre's potential private scene in Braavos (while Stan and Dave are at the Bank) will be ?
Â 
She has to have one. Carice said her character will have more development this season and this is the last opportunity before the Wall to have scene dedicated only to her.
Â 
In the other thread, I saw a spec about going to a Temple of Light in Braavos and I really like the idea !

Â 
I don't think it's the Temple - they would have been tempted to put something like this in promo material and there was nothing. I think she is in Dragonstone, perhaps a scene with Selyse? There was something about powders...good God I hope they won't have Selyse getting a love potion from Mel

^^ This.Â  So much.Â  I've seen a couple of comments in show-only threads where people complained that the mention of Stannis going to the Wall was simply a 'head fake' since he's obviously going to KL.Â  Its being very nicely obfuscated.

My guess is that with the Stan-Davos visit, we'll just get an overall glimpse of Braavos and I predict it will look amazing.Â  Then, we won't get the real real estate tour of the city until we get there with Arya.
4870	Arkash	2014-05-08	If Stannis leave Mel behind, that means a trip back to Dragonstone, rallying the army and heading North.
Â 
Makes sense, but I doubt we will see any of that. The whole Dragonstone team will be absent from episodes 7 and 8.
Â 
So the idea of a Mel and Selyse scene in Dragonstone seems the most obvious.
4871	The Onion Sleight	2014-05-08	@titanx5 & sati: I think that, too  (Damn, why did I already spoiled my mother his arrival at The Wall?! -.-)
But I hope we'll see despite this that he needs to find support in The North later for his plans for Winterfell (even if he might have more men then than in the books). 
He should still try to get Northmen on his side (With some success... like Glovers, Mormonts, partly Umbers, the Mountain Clans, in the future Manderly...). I want to see Northmen and Stark vassals marching with him to Winterfell and being ready to fight against the Boltons, because of vengeance and love; and not Braavosi sellswords who do this because of gold!
@acosta: I full agree with sati! He hasn't even mention The North / Wall / NW (not even one word about it) till now, there was no talk about their exacte plans in 4x02 and x03.
Also -as sati said- after Joff's death we only heard him talking about his claim and the throne and that this death changed the situation, he has to use every chance now to make "his claim be not forgotten!".
For us book readers it's known what his next steps will be, but many Unsullied (could) believe that it'd be logical and fitting for Stannis when plans now a new attack at KL, especially if the show/IBoB will give him the opportunity for this.
Imo, they are really tyring to make his arrival a surprise (despite the events of 3x10)!

Maybe they'll show Mel and Selyse in ep.7 or 8 and they too mention him attacking KL. I'm just so excited for my Unsullied friends' minds being blown in a month ^^
4873	The Onion Sleight	2014-05-08	I'm wondering what he'll tell the IBoB... They emphasize so much the Crown's and Lannsiters' problems with the bank (in nearly every episode now), but I'm not sure if that's already enough for the bank to turn away from them and turn to Stannis (they are not paying the debts back atm, but they also haven't refuse the paying openly till now).
I could imagine the IB would support an attack on KL = light a fire under the Lannisters (even if the attack would fail) & Stannis on the IT would rather pay back the debts in the future, even his brother's ones (if the attack would work).
But supporting help for the NW protits actually nothing for the Iron Bank at this moment, a king on the throne would be usefull for them, a king at The Wall who loses his seats and lands and isn't accepted as king less usefull (so I don't think they would back him (NOW!) for his idea with heading North, but for his fight for the throne).
...Or would they?!
Because the problem with my theory: Who are the men of his army who win the Battle of Castle Black? Are the few houses on his side enough (even if the Wildlings' army bigger and the NW weaker on the show) or are Braavosi sellswords necessary for him and his victory?

Â 
Perhaps they're just fed up with the Crown being in so much debt thanks to Lannisters....Stannis is known to be an honorable man - he is a stable candidate for the Throne and he is more likely to pay the debt than a child who is a pawn for Lannisters who not only don't honor their agreement, contrary to pay their debts saying, but also are covered in dishonor - incest, RW etc.
Â 
I imagine they give him money and he gets an army but then changes his destination and we hear the reason why in 4x10.
4875	The Onion Sleight	2014-05-08	^ So you think he'll tell them the gold (sellswords, ships) is for KL, but they don't watch how he uses it actually and don't care about his use of their gold? (Because as king on the IT he could pay the debts faster than as king at The Wall, and that's the only thing which matters for them, isn't it?)
But I think, you could be right!

Â 
I think they know everything, these bank dudes  Maybe they even get pissed off, then turn to Cersei and after she tells them to eff off they go back to Stannis hoping he'll win the Throne, finally, and pay the debts, because everyone is better than drunk, crazy Cersei ^^. But that's all future seasons talk.
4877	The Onion Sleight	2014-05-08	^ Haha, seems legit ;-)
I guess, you're right about it. Well, we will see what will happen in the future...
4878	Thelastactionhero	2014-05-08	God I hope Mel doesn't go with them for the boatride. Otherwise it'll end up with her convincing him to go North instead of him finally realizing for himself what it actually means to be a King. D&D can do whatever terrible things they want with the character later, but come'on, at least let Stan get the credit for this one victory.
4879	voodooqueen126	2014-05-08	I remember seeing those pics -- I wonder if they could be Oberyn? Interestingly, the person's/dummy's face isn't shown.
True, these images don't reflect the book's combat sequences, but that isn't really relevant, as it hardly needs to be said that the show doesn't religiously follow the books.
Why else would The Mountain be fighting between now and episode 7?


the clothes are too poor to be Oberyn Martell's
4880	iheartseverus	2014-05-08	^ I'm afraid its the nice farmer who took in Arya and the Hound earlier.
4881	Konradsmith	2014-05-08	No, it's just a King's Landing beggar. There was a shot in the first trailer of Citywatch men holding down some beggars and then of the Mountain swinging at them. Also it was shot at the city walls of Dubrovnik which stand in for KL's walls.

					
					
							Edited by Konradsmith, 08 May 2014 - 08:52 PM.
4882	Arkash	2014-05-08	We are very close to the return of the Mountain. Either this episode or the next.
Â 
I'd wish his first appearance would be when Cersei names him champion, at the trial. (Would be a good episode 6 ending).
Â 
But we have know idea why he'd kill these beggars. Perhaps they annoyed him too much and he's furious. Perhaps Cersei ordered him to clean the Walls... any way, seems we'll have a good Mountain in the episodes to come !
4883	Konradsmith	2014-05-08	The shot of Cersei looking down from the KL walls in one of the trailers is her watching him at his killing. This is confirmed by a picture that Lena Headey and Thor Bjornsson took together. Not only is she dwarfed by him but his greatsword is pretty much as big as she is. My thought is that she's having him kill people brutally as a demonstration of power to intimidate anyone who'd want to champion for Tyrion. It'll happen in episode seven.

4887	Arkash	2014-05-08	Really looking forward to the recap (Previously On), it should be published anytime soon now ! Will give us a lot more to discuss.
Â 
I really wish the episode ends up with Tyrion asking for trial by combat after realizing he is doomed anyway and Cersei smirking. "I planned that ruse. I alteady chose a champion." And then, Gregor enters. And like other said, reactions of Oberyn, Tyrion and cut.
4888	Mel_Rose	2014-05-08	Re: Stannis and the bank, I highly doubt they will have him take a trip to Braavos only to be turned down. What's the point of this development then? And since we know that he "hasn't got enough men to raid a pantry" and we also know he ends up victorious at the Wall, I strongly believe he will indeed get the money to get swords.
Â 
I can see the bank backing 2 horses, as it were, and keeping their options open. Devious.
Â 
Re: The Mountain, I know people said it's a good idea to introduce him at the trial but viewers will go "mountain who?".Â  Book readers were fully aware of the character and his deeds before we got to the scene. In the show, we need to be reminded of how brutal and monstrous he is before the trial to raise the stakes of his fight with Oberyn.

That's a good point. I despise Cersei and feel she acts out of hubris, so I don't necessarily like the idea of giving her a legit reason to tell the IB to piss off.Â 
Â 
But D&D seem hellbent on making every character gray, so it is what it is.Â

Â 
Â 

Â 
Given how much Oberyn's hate of him as been explained and showed and the recent mentions of him in Arya's storyline ; at the Inn, around the fire... I think most viewers see who he is. His introduction as the champion could work before the introduction of his brutality on those walls.

Â 
The bath she's seen lying in in the "coming weeks" promo certainly looks ornate(or "Gothic") enough to be a piece of furniture on Dragonstone.Â  It seems hard to imagine where "Melisandre and her powders" fits in with the general storyline but I've always liked getting little "spoilers" of her backstory earlier in the show.
Â 
In ADWD Selyse wants to renew her vows with Stannis in a "R'hllorian" ceremony in the hope that they will finally have sons, so actually the idea of the "love potion" isn't that off the wall Â Â Â  I always just assumed though that Mel liked to keep her magick tricks to herself.Â  Maybe the powders will have big labels on them

not sure why, but i just chuckled when i read angry sansa.
re: stannis -Â i hope stan mentions that he has 1500 men while he's at the bank. i dont really want him to have to get sellswords because that will just decrease the chances of us getting the "STANNIS! STANNIS! STANNIS!" chant. i really want that

I think they know everything, these bank dudes  Maybe they even get pissed off, then turn to Cersei and after she tells them to eff off they go back to Stannis hoping he'll win the Throne, finally, and pay the debts, because everyone is better than drunk, crazy Cersei ^^. But that's all future seasons talk.


Honorable Stannis wouldn't lie to get the money.Â  They may offer him the money if he turns back south, and you set up another conflict between Mel and Davos on which way to go.Â  Take the money, and KL, or head north for the "only fight that matters".Â  Cut scene, and you don't see them again until they are at the Wall.
Â 
Then Tycho comes later, when Stannis is re-entering the War of Five Kings.

4909	TommenFoolery	2014-05-09	We are very close to the return of the Mountain. Either this episode or the next.
Â 
I'd wish his first appearance would be when Cersei names him champion, at the trial. (Would be a good episode 6 ending).


Â 
I wonder how they reintroduce him for non book readers? Â It's not like they can show scenes from past seasons as he's been played by two different actors already? Â Maybe that's why Oberyn references so much up to this point?
4910	Hath4	2014-05-09	In episode 7 there will be a scene were the mountain kills some poor peasants in kings landing for fun. That will establish him quite well.

Â 
Many Unsullied don't remember that Mhysa scene. Hell, I had some people tell me they have no clue who Jon Arryn was after last episode aired. You are overestimating people's memory here.
Â 
The scene in 4x03 already set them up to think of KL - with Stannis getting so worked up that Joffrey is dead but he has no army, so he can't do anything about it. Rewatch the scene, it is implied he wants to take the Throne because his 'claim will be forgotten'.
Â 
They are trying to make it as surprising as it can be for non book readers. It's fairly evident considering that the only shots of his army in trailers are hard to identify, unless you pause it and look at the banners.


I think you're actually underestimating the unsullieds, most of the people i knew were blown away by Jon Arryn's revelation, and yes, most people also remembers he said he will go to the North back in season 3...
Â 
...but, the show did a good job at making Stannis stay in Dragonstone longer than in the books, and even mention how KL is ready to be taken as soon as he has an army (and not mention the wall on his storyline again), so people get confused about what his next move should be. Those who have been paying atention will be rewarded, and those who think he'll try to take KL, will be surprised in the good way

Â 
People are also suggesting the possibility of "Yara" being captured and used in place of Jeyne eventually.Â 
Â 
I know GRRM recently said essentailly "the books and show are different, it doesn't mean anything" in his own way (at least that's what I took from his comment) but when we have scenarios clearly inspired by twow chapters, and grrm posting said chapter the week that episode aired, it makes it clear that the show is taking cues from unaired content.

4947	boojam	2014-05-10	In and Around the Dreadfort: Ramsay has sex with Myranda. I assume Myranda is killed and that the blood on Ramsay's body is hers. Yara sails up to the Dreadfort and infiltrates it with her men. There is a battle between the Bolton soldiers and Greyjoy raiders. Ramsay kills many ironmen (shown in the Weapons & Training video). Yara rescues Theon at some point, but is cornered and probably loses the fight. Unknown what happens to Yara (death, capture or escape?). Roose leaves the Dreadfort before the attack, presumably.-It's odd, I thought Yara/Asha had 50 of the most hard assed Ironborn reavers, how could Ramsay , even with twice that number of his men stand a chance against them?Now if Ramsay showed up with 1000 Bolton soldiers I would buy it.

Of course they've been filmed. The entire season was filmed months before it's release. Didn't you even notice the trailers that were released months ago contain footage from the final five episodes e,g. Viper/Mountain fight, Shae in Tywin's bed. It would be impossible to film the final five episodes after the season premiere and have it ready in time.

On another front, I wonder if Chekhov's necklace will appear during the trial.Â  I thought it was pretty suspicious that Littlefinger dropped it into the boat with Dontos' body, rather than simply throwing it into the water.Â  They can poison some poor animal (or peasant!) during the trial to show how deadly the beads are, and they'll claim Tyrion gave the necklace to his wife to wear at the wedding and arranged for Dontos to help Sansa escape--after which Sansa killed Dontos.

4961	iheartseverus	2014-05-10	Somebody please remind me--in the books, what testimony did Varys give at Tyrion's trial?
4962	sati	2014-05-10	Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>Lord Varys,â<U+0080><U+009D> the herald said, â<U+0080><U+009C>master of whisperers.â<U+0080><U+009D> Powdered, primped, and smelling of rosewater, the Spider rubbed his hands one over the other all the time he spoke. Washing my life away. Tyrion thought, as he listened to the eunuchâ<U+0080><U+0099>s mournful account of how the Imp had schemed to part Joffrey from the Houndâ<U+0080><U+0099>s protection and spoken with Bronn of the benefits of having Tommen as king. Half-truths are worth more than outright lies. And unlike the others, Varys had documents; parchments painstakingly filled with notes, details, dates, whole conversations. So much material that its recitation took all day, and so much of it damning. Varys confirmed Tyrionâ<U+0080><U+0099>s midnight visit to Grand Maester Pycelleâ<U+0080><U+0099>s chambers and the theft of his poisons and potions, confirmed the threat heâ<U+0080><U+0099>d made to Cersei the night of their supper, confirmed every bloody thing but the poisoning itself. When Prince Oberyn asked him how he could possibly know all this, not having been present at any of these events, the eunuch only giggled and said, â<U+0080><U+009C>My little birds told me. Knowing is their purpose, and mine.â<U+0080><U+009D> How do I question a little bird? thought Tyrion. I should have had the eunuchâ<U+0080><U+0099>s head off my first day in Kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Landing. Damn him. And damn me for whatever trust I put in him.

I really wonder how they'll play it. In that pic she looks so frightened. But we know from the trailers the next time we see her definetly happens in the show, so her motives - fear, gold, whatever it will be on the show - won't save her from being a horrible person when the second one happens.

I doubt the necklace will come up again, although if it does, it will most likely play out like that.
Â 
On another note, I just looked up the next episode on HBO'S schedule, which tells us that the episode is indeed only 51 minutes long. So maybe there actually is some truth to that picture on reddit?

He may have been withewashed, but Trant, Cersei, Pycelle (Lancel?)...they all have things to say about Tyrion's rule as hand of the king.

It does NOT mean direct spoilers for episodes that haven't aired yet. Speculation is fine. Actual episode information from leaks is a bit much.
Â 
Anyway now I will not click on any thread about episodes that haven't aired yet.


Â 
Excellent.

That's a good questionÂ
4978	iliasb	2014-05-11	do you think there is a realistic chance they kill off asha/yara in the show? that would really piss me off as amything else so far...


Â 
Don't think so, she will still have to battle stannis which is too crucial to leave out....

4991	Scrambled Aegon	2014-05-11	I have an unspoiled friend who absolutelyÂ lovedÂ Tyrion/Shae. He was in total denial about how doomed their relationship was and they were his total OTP, and I assured him that, yes, Shae really was gone, and no, we won't see her again.

So tonight's episode should fuck him up pretty badly.

Â 
Tywin sends letter to Jorah, gets intercepted, Dany finds out, bye-bye ser friendzone!
Â 
i think Tywin's sending the letter serves two purposes -Â 
1) might be able to convince Jorah, like the Freys, to join him instead
2) intentionally causing Jorah to get busted causing conflict in Dany's camp

5007	direwoofwoof	2014-05-12	Other episodes have disected the title, so how about this one? The Laws of Gods and Man
Â 
Tyrian's trial, of course
Â 
Dany's laws and rules over Mereen
Â 
The Iron Bank's "laws" and rules over borrowing
Â 
Ramsey's cruel rules and "laws" for his followers
Â 
Yara's sense of duty/rules for rescuing her brother
Â 
Varys' "laws" of working for the realm
5008	iheartseverus	2014-05-04	https://www.youtube....h?v=hEb5pEMC7fw
Â 
So, we know we get Yara (Yay!) and nice Daddy Lannister asking Tyrion if he wants to confess to Joff's murder.Â  And (my favorite) Stannis with 'Mycroft' at the Iron Bank.Â  Braavos, coming up!
5009	pntrlqst	2014-05-04	Seems a very focused episode. King's Landing, Stannis, Theon/Ramsay, and Dany. Possibly no Arya, Sansa, Brienne, Jon, or Bran.
Â 
I think it'll be structured exactly as episode two was. Final 20 minutes or so will be devoted to the trial.

					
					
							Edited by pntrlqst, 04 May 2014 - 10:20 PM.
5010	Benjaario Starkharis	2014-05-04	I get the feeling every scene in this episode is going to be great. I wonder how Yara will manage to escape, though, because she has no door behind her to retreat through. Stannis sounds like he will be awesome too. Even Dany could be interesting with Drogon killing the shepherd's child.
5011	Rhaegar I Targaryen	2014-05-04	Cannot wait to see the Dreadfort scene
Â 
I doubt Ramsay would go into battle with no armor whatsoever though that seems nuts
5012	Hath4	2014-05-04	Well this is ramsay, one of his major qualities is his fearlessness which is mentioned in the books many times.

Â 
Right it's just that in close quarters against armored, shield wearing Ironborn that maybe isn't the best idea to lead the charge with no armor on. Wonder how he got all that blood on himself though?Â 
Â 
Maybe he doesn't like when Myranda slaps himÂ
5015	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-04	Hazzea confirmed for episode 6. I thought it was 8, but this makes sense. The chapter with her holding court and meeting supplicants ends with meeting the goatherder.
Â 
So Dany/Daario sex in E7. E8 hesitating what to do with dragons and probably finding out Jorah is still spying on her and reporting to Varys (who is reading Jorah Mail to the Small Council in E6). E9 skip. E10 banishing Jorah and chaining The Children.
Â 
In fact, I loved how "First of His Name" makes it clear Daenerys has the power to invade but she stays behind because Jorah, who was against her slave crusade ("We don't need Yunkai, Khaleesi"), is now using her slave crusade to convince her to stay.

5016	lostinwesteros	2014-05-04	It'll be intense. Good to see Jaime confronting Tywin, though we know it won't make any difference.  Strange to see Ramsey with those slashes preparing to fight with no shirt. Anxious to see what state Theon/Reek will have disintegrated to by this time and how Asha will react.  Wondering where Bolton is during all this.  Guess no Arya, no Eyrie, no Dany (Yay!), no Jon, no Bran. Probably why 4.05 did so much catchup work on those story lines.
5017	Gonzalo	2014-05-04	Finally Mace Tyrell at the Small Council.
5018	Citabel	2014-05-04	Did Stannis smirk right there?

Â 
Dany is in the trailer.
5020	Konradsmith	2014-05-04	Now we know why Jaime and Tywin's confrontation in "Two Swords" was somewhat muted. They've milked it into another scene later down the line, which I think is a good choice. This time they'll have an even bigger disagreement and more sparks will fly.
Â 
I really doubt thatÂ Bran or Jon will show up because we've seen them so much in eps. 4 and 5. The focus will be tighter and they'll give the trial, Yara's attack and Stan with the IBOBÂ room to play out.
5021	Gneisenau	2014-05-05	Varys knows really quickly that Dany is staying as "Queen of Meereen", so I guess Jorah is still spying on her (and that's how he'll get banned)? I don't like that.

News seems to travel really fast in GoT anyway
5022	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-05	This episode looks like it could be great. I'm very interested in the Dreadfort and Braavos storylines. It's some non-book material that I'm really looking forward too. Shirtless Ramsay looks to be an epic scene.Â
5023	CandleWisps	2014-05-05	I'm waiting to see how seriously the Small Council takes the news of Dany. Tywin did seem to take a deep, pouty breath of "jesus wtf do I have to deal with now"
Â 
Excited for Asha/Yara, love her but i'm not sure how this change will work
5024	averde	2014-05-05	The Ironborn and Ramsays troops look fairly even in number in that scene, and the Ironborn guys seem to be better armed and armored and are supposedly the "best killers on the Iron Islands" 
Interested to see how that plays out in anyway that makes sense and interested to see where Asha ends up. I also think it's odd Balon let his last chance for an heir run off on such a dangerous mission with such a little amount of men. The whole situation is odd.

Yea I keep thinking it's gotta happen any episode now. It would be great to see a FM on the bridge.Â
5029	CandleWisps	2014-05-05	Just waiting for Balon to die so we get more budget to cast Euron and Victarion tbh. Definitely hope they keep his eventual demise to the bridge scene

5031	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-05-05	Tycho Nestoris: Do you feel your blood gives you claim on our gold?
Stannis the Mannis: More than any man living.
GET HYPED. Stannis is back. Hopefully.
5032	Fjordgazer	2014-05-05	So, this episode will have 2 major detours from the books going on: Stannis at Braavos & Yara at the Dreadfort (this one announced since last season). The Stan stuff could be played well to bring him back to canon since they're streatching the Wall storyline somewhat. But the Yara stuff has been discussed to death for a year now. Where's she going? I hope they're not changing her whole story.
Â 
The show seems very whimsical as to which storylines get stretched out with filler (Bran, Jon, Stannis) and which ones are being moved along without bumps (Brienne, Theon, Dany). Keeping the pace (and averaging both sides) is the KL stuff.
5033	Red Tiger	2014-05-05	Â

5036	Koi No Yokan	2014-05-05	Finally, Asha! Really, really hope she doesn't become a torture victim though.
Â 


Speaking of Balon, when are we gonna see him die and possibly confirm the theories about his death ?


Â 
I assume it will be in the final episode, to help pave way for next season's reintroduction of the Ironborn.Â
5037	Konradsmith	2014-05-05	Stan the Man's point was that his namesake is back in alpha mode after spending significant screentime being more inverse and brooding. He had quiteÂ the gleam in his eye. I guess this willÂ be what resuscitates Stan and Dave's (b)romance, after Dave's clever plan to write to the IBOB bears fruit. I'm liking what I see and am looking forward to it.
Â 
As for Yara, we'll find out where this is all going. It looks promising, especially with Ramsay going allÂ mad dog on some Ironborn fellows and bringing on someÂ psychopathic shirtless fanservice for the ladies. I just wonder howÂ she could possibly get out of this squeeze alive. In the trailer we can see that Yara and co. actually have Theon and we know Theon will get taken back...So I dunno. Here's hoping she escapes somehow.
5038	Red Tiger	2014-05-05	This would have been a great episode to crown Euron. Bummer.
5039	JonDunn	2014-05-05	Balon isn't going to die until right before they introduce Euron and Victarion. Â 
Â 
So Balon dies at the end of this season or to start next season. Â
5040	petertel123	2014-05-05	stannis sounds awesome!
5041	salmonsnake	2014-05-05	So I guess this'll have most of Tyrion's trial, except for Oberyn's decision to be his champion? I really wonder how they can play out Shae as witness (and episode 10 for that matter). They had to know they were going to give themselves a lot of headache with the way they changed her character.
5042	Mel_Rose	2014-05-05	^Well, she did look mighty pissed off with Tyrion when he broke up with her.
5043	Hath4	2014-05-05	its verry intersting that yara and her crew even manage to to succesfully take theon from his cell and actually have him when ramsay arrives at his kennels. it looks to be a pretty fair fight, ramsay has a few more,but yara has the better soldiers. It looks like it would be pretty hard to get reek back. So maybe its reek who chooses to return to his masters side in his broken stae. As for ramsay being shirless and coverd in blood, I dont think myrannda had a fun night.
5044	Tyrion1991	2014-05-05	Yara gets captured by Ramsey as a hostage. Next season both of them escape to Stannis.
5045	hollowcrown	2014-05-05	Balon will probably be revealed as randomly dead when Asha returns to the Iron Islands right?
Â 
Is he cast for this season?
5046	pntrlqst	2014-05-05	So I guess this'll have most of Tyrion's trial, except for Oberyn's decision to be his champion?

They had to know they were going to give themselves a lot of headache with the way they changed her character.


Â 
I never understood this sentiment. Shae was shown to be petty, brash, and overemotional from the get-go. Sure, she loved Tyrion but that doesn't automatically erase all a person's negative characteristics. What's so unrealistic about a scorned lover (a petty, brash, and overemotional one at that) becoming vengeful.

Hizdhar has been cast this season, so I'm wondering what episode Mr. Loraq will appear. Could potentially be conflict between Darro-Jorah or Jorah-Hizdhar that causes the banishment of Jorah... Who knows? 
I'm just too confused about the Ramsay scene in the trailer, but looking forward to it. Is it next week yet?

All I do is wonder. Undoubtedly she was angry, undoubtedly she will be bitter. That is not, however, the thing that interests me. It's a considerable step from a very personal grudge to what will take place behind the scenes leading up to the trial and beyond

Â 
We have already seen Loraq in episode 3, he was amongst the Mereenese nobles/slave masters. But he didnt say anything, just smiled, probably Dany will have a conversation with him as season progressesÂ 
Â 
Really really looking forward to Stannis IBoB scene, wonder how its going to play out. As for Asha/Yara we have all been discussing what is going to happen with this scene for close to a year, so only 1 more week till we can try cross off certain theories about her storyline. Â
5052	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-05-05	This episode has me more excited than I've been for any other episode this season (besides the premiere, of course). Stannis at Braavos, Tyrion's trial, Drogon doing something bad, and the action at the Dreadfort are all really exciting.
Â 
I'm wondering one thing though: when are we getting the bloody gift of mercy? It's getting really late.
5053	I'll pay the iron price	2014-05-05	The Dreadfort action will be awesome!

5058	Frey Pies	2014-05-05	I am beyond hyped for Dreadfort. Seeing how well they handled Craster's Keep, I have no doubt that the scenes at the Dreadfort will be amazing.
Â 
Plus Tyrion's trial. And more Oberyn. Jaime and Tywin (always awesome)! And Danaerys in the throne room (probably Hazzea!). And Drogon! And Stannis at Braavos! And Mark Gatiss!
Â 
Wow, this episode has the potential to be one of my favourites of the entire series (as if season 4 doesn't already have enough great episodes). The second half of this season will probably be something special!
5059	graaf_x	2014-05-05	I remember someone saying there are 70 minutes material of Tyrion in a cell. We have seen only two scenes, then there's Oberyn to come in EP7 and escape in EP10 ("Came for a last look?" also in finale, I believe). Who and when may come to visit him? Bronn, maybe Varys. But it will hardly make for 70 minutes.Â

Right it's just that in close quarters against armored, shield wearing Ironborn that maybe isn't the best idea to lead the charge with no armor on. Wonder how he got all that blood on himself though?Â 
Â 
Maybe he doesn't like when Myranda slaps himÂ  


Yeah it does seem very silly.
5061	Koi No Yokan	2014-05-05	I am beyond hyped for Dreadfort. Seeing how well they handled Craster's Keep, I have no doubt that the scenes at the Dreadfort will be amazing.
Â 
Plus Tyrion's trial. And more Oberyn. Jaime and Tywin (always awesome)! And Danaerys in the throne room (probably Hazzea!). And Drogon! And Stannis at Braavos! And Mark Gatiss!
Â 
Wow, this episode has the potential to be one of my favourites of the entire series (as if season 4 doesn't already have enough great episodes). The second half of this season will probably be something special!


Â 
Yeah, it's shaping up to be a good one. I'm actually a bit surprised that we're at the Hazzea scene already; I thought they'd be saving her for the finale alongside the probable chaining of dragons and Jorah's banishment, to give an extra knockout blow to her season arc. No complaints here though.
Â 
I'm hoping Asha kills Myranda. Just being a general nuisance to Ramsay will be good enough, really.
5062	I'll pay the iron price	2014-05-05	Just had a thought on the Dreadfort.
Supposing Yara gets to Theon then she gets overwhelmed by Boltons on her way out.
Cornered and alone, Theon pushes Yara out of a window to safety.
Ramsey recaptures Theon and is SUPER mad at him for "betraying" him and allowing Yara to flee
Â 
I'm SO looking forward to the Dreadfort scene.
5063	Koi No Yokan	2014-05-05	I remember someone saying there are 70 minutes material of Tyrion in a cell. We have seen only two scenes, then there's Oberyn to come in EP7 and escape in EP10 ("Came for a last look?" also in finale, I believe). Who and when may come to visit him? Bronn, maybe Varys. But it will hardly make for 70 minutes.Â 


Â 
I'd say someone probably just misinterpreted or exaggerated that 70 minutes worth of Tyrion was only in his cell.
5064	Lord_Dustin	2014-05-05	One of the things that I am most excited about for this episode:
Â 
The return of the Sakharov/Cogman directing and writing team! Â I'm hoping for another 'What is Dead May Never Die'!
5065	BorhPT	2014-05-05	Just a quick question,

	Spoiler in the books, Stannis ever goes to Braavos??? I can't recall that but maybe I wasn't paying attention... i think he went straight back to the Wall. What could this change in his storyline? getting the sellswords early, maybe get some now for the attack on the Wall. No Tycho Nestoris going to the Wall, buying the Ironmen, bringing Theon/Reek to Stannis, no Justin Massey going to Braavos...
5066	aFeastForDragons	2014-05-05	The Dreadfort scene will be awesome.
Â 
I wonder what will happen between Yara and Ramsey. Neither of them can die.Â 
Â 
Edit: Alternate plotline to the books. Stannis gets a trillion gold dragons and invades Westeros with a hundred thousands sellswords:P

5067	Queen of Whores	2014-05-05	Am I the only one who is concerned about the amount of feel good moments coming up?
Â 
ASOIAF is about realism, the good guys dont always win, but apart from oberyn, who is gonna do this season to counterbalance all the huge evil deaths?

I wouldn't say it's feel-good. When I finished A Storm of Swords I didn't feel like it was uplifting or happy. It felt very bittersweet and exhausting. Hopefully that translates to the screen.
5068	Mordos_Kull	2014-05-05	Hopefully Mace Tyrell gets some form of character development.
Â 
Aside from his minor presence presenting his gift to Joffrey, he has been too much of a background character.Â 
Â 
I'm surprised he's had no Tyrell scenes with Oleanna or Margaery.

5070	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-05	Â 
I never understood this sentiment. Shae was shown to be petty, brash, and overemotional from the get-go. Sure, she loved Tyrion but that doesn't automatically erase all a person's negative characteristics. What's so unrealistic about a scorned lover (a petty, brash, and overemotional one at that) becoming vengeful.


Â 
And what of Tyrion's negative characteristics? "You're a whore!"Â Tyrion is scared and insecure.Â Shae isn't also just scorned, she's also now in the clutches of Cersei and Tywin. Who knows what threats they threw in her face?
5071	salmonsnake	2014-05-05	Therein lies the complexity. Will they make the threats explicit or the personal grudge explicit. Makes me wonder
5072	King Tommen	2014-05-05	As a side note, with the shot of Bran pulling himself through the snow in the last episode, I believe we now have seen every bit of released footage that has been in trailers or behind the scenes clips of his story. So anything that happens to him from here on out will be completely spoiler-free.
Â 
We don't even know how many more episodes he appears in (although the finale would be a given). 5 episodes seems like a pretty long time to sit on the bench though.

5075	Father of Dragons	2014-05-05	Pause at about 0:04 in the preview, with the shot of the Ironborn. You can see Theon on the middle and YarAsha behind him. There's confirmation for anyone having doubts about whether or not he will be released from his cell/cage. Obviously he won't escape the Dreadfort, but he'll at least see his sister.

Â 
Considering the Ramsay/Roose conversation in Episode 2, I think that it is highly likely that Ramsay will want to take her alive.
5081	ChillinLikeSerIlyn	2014-05-05	Here's what I'm thinking re: Yara-Â 
Â 
Her mission ultimately fails and all her men are killed but her. Roose steps in and takes her before Ramsay can do anything fucked up to her. Ramsay and Reek continue their mission to Moat Cailin (I like the idea someone mentioned of the Boltons disguising themselves in the Ironborn attire). Roose takes Yara with him to Winterfell (or wherever he's going) as a hostage, and gives her some of the exposition he gives Reek in the book.

Not if Balon dies soon.Besides a ransom is a pittance compared to sealing the Lordship of Winterfell.
5084	King Tommen	2014-05-05	In whatever divergence the Yara plot goes, there's nothing logical about her being posed as Arya Stark in order to fool Northmen into supporting the Boltons.Â  It's far more likely that if she's involved with Ramsay and Theon, post this episode, that she'll be Yara, only captured, and play the part of the girl Theon needs to save from Ramsay to get out of Winterfell.
Â 
In all likelihood, there is no FArya on the show. They will come up with another reason (as they often do) to get everyone to Winterfell and they'll go from there. And feel free to insert the many, many reasons why a Fake Arya just HAS to be present on the show. I've heard them all before and you can write around all of them if you want to.
5085	Guard of the Rainking	2014-05-05	Not if Balon dies soon.Besides a ransom is a pittance compared to sealing the Lordship of Winterfell.


Yara still has a claim on the Iron Islands and is (most likely) fertile. If Roose or Ramsay would get a son they could marry him to Yara and claim the Iron Islands in her name in 14(ish) years. Also showing both Yara and Theon (maybe even executing him) would show the power of house Bolton to the North.Â

You're missing something hugely important in the books.The Northern lords are not fooled by fArya,most or all of them know she's fake.It's a mummer's farce and the lords play along through fear.It seals Ramsay as Lord of Winterfell,something which Roose knows the importance of,if not Ramsay.
Â 
Personally I have never complained about show divergences from the books,due to the intrinsic necessities of the different media.But if there is no fArya in the show,whether Yara or not,then I've completely misread the books,and so have D&D.

Yea I have to admit I was pumped when I saw that scene in the preview. Let's hope its a new beginning for Show!Stannis.

Â 


Â 
If it's a farce that no one really believes (which I more or less agree is the case in the books), then all the more reason to jettison the plot. The Bolton's still have the backing of the Crown, they still have the force to rule by fear, they can dictate what the bannermen have to do because none of them have the ability or willingness to challenge them. You don't need a wedding to legitimize Ramsay, the Crown can do whatever they want. Roose has already been gifted Winterfell by Tywin (as was revealed in the S3 finale) so it's a done deal.
5090	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-05	It's a shame we won't get the Asha Theon reunion from the book now, but I suppose it wouldn't be quite as impactful since Theon is at least recognizable in the show. As others have said I'm really hoping Yara escapes, but I hope we get to see her kick some ass first.

5091	Faceless Man Friday	2014-05-05	I think the show is going to leave out the fake Arya bit. Â My guess is Yara gets captured trying to free Theon. Â Ramsey remembers how disappointed his father was over what he did to Theon so he presents Yara to his father unharmed as a valuable hostage. Â Next season both Theon and Yara escape to join Stannis.
5092	King Tommen	2014-05-05	What I'm especially glad for is that this episode will more or less prove or disprove this theory fairly definitively and I'll be able to know where that storyline is going. I can see them going in multiple directions so this is in no way anymore than a working theory at this point but I'm glad the long wait will finally be over by this time next week.

I definitely don't think Yara will take the role of Jeyne Pool either, but I will say that jettisoning the plot entirely does have some serious butterfly effect ramifications. Simply dismissing them offhandedly, while assuming the showrunners will come up with a more reasonable explanation for why the characters end up at Winterfell, (cause all of their other deviations and filler have turned out just great, lol), is rather silly. It's an important piece of character development for Melisandre and Jon, Stannis and Jon, and a bit of a partial redemption arc for Theon. They'll have to give Mance a new reason for going to Winterfell, if he ends up still going at all depending on what they choose to do with the character. I could honestly see them just having Mance burn to death and ending his arc there. I will grant you that Theon and Yara escaping together sounds like a reasonable way of re-imagining the story though, especially since casting a new actress for a role that is relatively small in the books, despite being an important plot-device, goes against most of the major decisions the showrunners have made thus far.

We could get a similar version. Something along the lines of Asha vhecking the cells for Theon, looks.in his cell, moves on, something something, Theon speaks up, "sister".

That's true I would appreciate any little nod to that scene. Yea I just loved how after he refers to himself as Reek throughout all of ADWD he finally calls himself Theon again during their reunion. "My name is Theon. You have to know your name." That shit hit me hard on the first read.Â

Â 
Agreed. I think Shae's betrayal will be perfectly explainable. As for why she'll end up doing all the other things she does in the books: when the richest man in Westeros and grandfather of the king threatens to put your head on a spike, you'll do a great many stupid things...
Â 


I'm wondering one thing though: when are we getting the bloody gift of mercy? It's getting really late.


Â 
My guess would be ep. 4.08. It would tie in with Gregor's death, while still giving Arya enough time to get to the ship in ep. 4.10.

Episode 8 is probably going to have to handle the Hound's "death" already, so the gift bit would be even more material for one episode (though I guess it would be a fitting bookend to open that episode's Arya plot with that bit and then close with Arya refusing the same to the Hound).

I don't think so. Mel's visions on the show have been pretty spot-on, apart from her conviction that Stannis is Azor Ahai (which is something the books themselves have never really explained).Â  If they put in a scene where she tells Arya that they will meet again (said scene also foreshadowing Arya's assassin destiny), I expect that they will, in fact, meet again.

5118	Konradsmith	2014-05-05	^Well the Mountain will make his first appearance in "Mockingbird", so that plus Oberyn's visit to Tyrion makes it seem quite likely that a trial by combat has already been settled on.

5127	Ghost from Winterfell	2014-05-05	I hope Theon doesn't betray Yara. He is not that far gone yet IMO and helping her scape in some way would be a strong moment for him since we know from the books that he wasn't quickly turned into submission and that he could actually be a little defiant.

How do we know Roose is traveling to meet northern lords? I wish he could be in the Dreadfort during the action.
Â 
Anyway this gave me an idea of a scene that I think would be interesting: Roose meets with a random northern lord and manages to bullshit him that he had nothing to do with the Red Wedding and it was only for a matter of convenience and circumstances that he got the North, while subtly threatening him into submission in some way. The scene could play in a similar manner as Tywin "extending an olive branch to Oberyn" or the future scene of Littlefinger manipulating the Lords Declarants. That would cement Roose as a master political player and a formidable bad guy to the audience and the thousands of Unsullied who still don't pay attention to him and would give a good intro to the Bolton's storyline in season 5.
Â 
Not that I expect something like this will happen. Just an idea. 
Â 
Michael McElhatton does say he is "political animal through and through", so... he also seems to think a later scene with Roose and Ramsay is a bit heartbreaking while commenting on sons looking up for their fathers approvals. This makes me think we will get the "make me rue" line this season. Due to recent controversies though I think the audience would go ballistic.
5128	Conchobar	2014-05-05	^Now all they need to do is have Roose shirtless having sexposition with Walda plus leeches.

5132	Kungsmurfen	2014-05-05	It's a shame we won't get the Asha Theon reunion from the book now, but I suppose it wouldn't be quite as impactful since Theon is at least recognizable in the show. As others have said I'm really hoping Yara escapes, but I hope we get to see her kick some ass first.


Â 
I'm pretty sure that's the only reason we have this assault on the Dreadfort. So that we can se that Asha is badass to make sure that people root for her at the kingsmoot.Â

5134	Konradsmith	2014-05-05	Too bad he probably won't be in episode six. Or in the show at all until "the Children". But McElhatton said that he says something that makes the audience pity Ramsay, so I'm guessing "rue the day". Now that'll ruffle some feathers (you know, the ones that have been ruffled in the last few weeks).

5138	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-05	There are really only two plausible options I see with yaras fate. She is either captured or she escapes. It is about 50/50. Killing her off seems like a huge waste of character. though I could say the same about Locke. But i do not think she will die. it will be interesting to see how this plays out.


Yea but at least Locke wasn't in the books and the character he is loosely portraying, Vargo, is killed. Asha is very much alive so killing her off would be much worse than Locke.Â

The most obvious/straightforward answer for this is that it depends how much of a role Asha (and the whole Iron Islands subplot in general) plays as the story moves forward. If the Iron islands doesn't end up playing as much of a role in the long-term as say, Dorne, then I can very easily see Yara being whacked by Ramsay during the assault. We've already been told last episode that Vic's essentially useless to the long-term now that Dany already has enough ships. That's one Greyjoy down.
Â 
But so yeah......Episode 6, IMO, looks like it'll be one of the most important episodes of the show for us Sullied fans as it'll largely determine the future of that particular book angle.

Â 
The whole ships thing kinda ticked me off. I was just sitting there going "...wait...wtf no". I didn't know whether to officially take that as the Greyjoy's are useless, the ships will eventually burn before Dany can use them, or Dany is never freaking going to Westeros. Idk man
5145	gandalf.ohwaitwrongseries	2014-05-05	So I guess this'll have most of Tyrion's trial, except for Oberyn's decision to be his champion? I really wonder how they can play out Shae as witness (and episode 10 for that matter). They had to know they were going to give themselves a lot of headache with the way they changed her character.


Changed or not, Shae was going to give them headaches anyway. The book doesn't give any explanation at all about her actions. The reveal that she slept with Tywin felt to me completely out of character - for both of them.
Â 


Am I the only one who is concerned about the amount of feel good moments coming up?
Â 
ASOIAF is about realism, the good guys dont always win, but apart from oberyn, who is gonna do this season to counterbalance all the huge evil deaths?


Are you kidding?! First of all, there is no such thing as "good guys" and "bad guys", but even if there was: are Ygritte and Shae "bad guys"? Will you be happy to see the Hound "die"? And not seeing anymore the most badass character of them all - Tywin - will be a very sad thing. No, my friend, this is a very sad season indeed.
Â 


Hopefully Mace Tyrell gets some form of character development.
Â 
Aside from his minor presence presenting his gift to Joffrey, he has been too much of a background character.Â 
Â 
I'm surprised he's had no Tyrell scenes with Oleanna or Margaery.


Hopefully Mace Tyrell isn't given any screen time at all. He has the charisma of a flower pot.

On whether the fArya plot will be included, I always thought that Melisandre's "We'll meet again" to Arya in season 3 was a foreshadowing to the fArya plot and Alys Karstark. Melisandre misinterpreted that she would see Arya again just as she misinterpreted her vision as Arya.Â

i hope its all next week, but what would happen in ep 7? just oberyn offering to be tyrions champion would seem weird like, is there a break in the trial or something. i think it will be oberyn, then shae. that will be the end of tyrion in ep 7

I wouldn't say it's feel-good. When I finished A Storm of Swords I didn't feel like it was uplifting or happy. It felt very bittersweet and exhausting. Hopefully that translates to the screen.


But that's mostly because ASOS is just one book, by the time we get to the "uplifting" part, the Red Wedding is still fresh in our minds, the second half of ASOS is mostly "happy" because it needed to balanced the sh**storm that preceed it.Â 
Â 
Anyways, answering what sad momments are next this season: Sandor's death, Danny locking the dragons and banishing Jorah, Oberyn's death. Tyrion and Jaime departing in bd terms, and LF getting control of the Vale (though some may think Lysa's flying lessons was a good thing )

Â 
Given the way the scene played out, I don't think Balon "let" Yara do anything. Balon was quite content to leave Theon to his fate, whereas Yara was not. What was he going to do? Throw his heir and only living child (as far as he is concerned) in chains? I mean, he could have, but it seems to me that Yara had made her mind up, and nothing was going to stop her from attempting to rescue Theon.Â 
Â 
In terms of the strategy... Well, you don't send an entire battalion on an extraction mission - you send a small force of highly skilled soldiers.Â

He could have easily had her confined to the castle, time out style, for awhile if he wanted to, especially if it was in their best interests to keep his heir alive. 
He could have sent a rescue party and some other ironborn great warrior, like his brother, to rescue Theon so that Asha wouldn't go. 
Finally since the Ironborn are battling for the north anyway and have a decent amount of troops there they could have easily decided to try and take the Dreadfort with a large force instead of sending in a rescue team.

Balons sons are all dead besides Theon who is in enemy hands and Asha is his only daughter and intended heir. When talking about brothers as heirs while this is technically true it's not something any of the lords seem to favor once they have their own children that's their "family and heirs". For example look at the Lannisters, Tywin thinks of Jaime as his heir and only hope for an heir and won't consider Tyrion, but he fails to even think of naming his loyal brother Kevan as heir.

Â 
He could have, but he didn't. I think it's made clear in the show that Balon - in his own way - has a great deal of respect for Yara. There's no doubt that it is in his best interest to keep her alive, but what about her interests? Namely, rescuing her brother? Yara made the decision to go and rescue Theon herself, as I'm sure most siblings would do in that scenario, if it were at all possible.Â Balon obviously doesn't have the same respect or love for Theon; something he made abundantly clear in his scene in the season three finale.Â 
Â 
And yes, the decision could have been made to send a large force to take the Dreadfort, but not if you're trying to ensure the survival of a hostage that - given what had been done to Theon already - the Bolton's don't seem all too concerned about. And again, I'm not sure Balon would have been willing to entertain that approach, either, since he seemed more than willing to leave Theon to his fate.Â 
Â 
As I said: Balon didn't "let" Yara do anything. It's not as if she is some commoner among the Iron Born - she's one of the most respected leaders in their entire army, and potentially the future leader of the Iron Islands. Yara made the decision to go and rescue her little brother, and that's exactly what she plans to do.Â

I'd bet on some tense staredown between Tyrion and Tywin. I don't think trial by combat's Mountain involvement will be mentioned yet, they'll save this for next ep with Oberyn's I can be your champion probably being the ending there.

That would be very cool but I think given how Cersei sees some poor bastards slaughtered by Clegane in ep.7 and that Oberyn's not a judge a champion line is so damn good they'll want to keep the Oberyn will fight Mountain revelation in one ep to make it more powerful. Sure everyone already saw it in trailers but I think I'll have chills when he offers to fight for Tyrion anyways.

5185	Arkash	2014-05-06	Okay, here trying something : trying to guess the architecture of the upcoming episode :
Â 
- Opening on Slaver's Bay. Hazzeah and Drogon.
- Daenerys holding court (meeting Hizdar) and then the farmer. Ending Meereen on a shot of Dany's anxious face.
Â 
- Small Council at KL.
- Tywin / Jaime scene after the SC.
- Varys / Oberyn scene in the Throne Room.
Â 
- Stannis setting sail from Dragonstone, discussing with Davos about their plans.
Â 
- Yara sailing through the woods, planning the attack.
- Something at the Dreadfort.
Â 
- Big scene number 1 : Braavos.
- Big scene number 2 : Attack on the Dreadfort.
- Big scene number 3 (episode finale) : Trial.
5186	Frey Pies	2014-05-06	By the way, I don't know where to post this (I tried submitting a thread some time ago, but it got deleted), so I'm really sorry if this is inappropriate (please forgive meÂ   ), but what do you guys think will happen in Mockingbird? We haven't really seen much from it.
Â 
We know it cannot be the Moon Door, since we know that Alex Graves filmed a shot with Lysa and Sansa. So what will be the big moment there?
Â 
I think it will include these things:
- Jon's triumphant return to Castle Black
- The Mountain cutting up those people
- Tyrion + Bronn
- Tyrion + Oberyn
- Probably the Brienne biting the ear off scene (could be episode 8 too though, but probably in this one)
- Dany and Daario's scene
- Something with Sansa/Littlefinger and the Vale (I'm truly stumped on what it can be- seems pretty important)
Â 
What else do you expect to see this episode? How good do you expect it to be?

Really? Could you send me a link? They could however have moved the scene into episode 7. If not I guess we could have Balon's death in episode 7 because you know EuronÂ Crow's (bird) Eye is a character fond of mockery.

There's this line Littlefinger has in first trailer 'I want to know which side you are on' - perhaps a scene with Lysa?
5189	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-06	That's a good list,Â Frey Pies. I'd add in Theon/Yara/Ramsay storyline as well. Looks like it could be a weak episode, which is fine I guess. I feel like there's only been 1 so far (First of His Name). There's usually 2 per season.

Really? Last year the we had at least 3 IMO and even more than that in season 2.
5191	JonDunn	2014-05-06	lol at thinking First of His Name was a weak ep.Â
5192	JonDunn	2014-05-06	This episode really needs to be Lion and the Rose lite and spend like 15 minutes straight on the trial.Â
5193	Guard of the Rainking	2014-05-06	lol at thinking First of His Name was a weak ep.Â 


Well it's just an opinion. I had a few cripes with like the way they handled the Jon Arryn reveal and how they killed Locke like it was nothing. Still for me it was the weakest of the 5 so far, which isn't to say that it was ironically weak.
Â 
Edit. However calling Game of Thrones episodes like this weak is usually because you're more used to the GoT quality.

Â 
I agree, or even longer.Â  I want to see some epic Inherit the Wind style speeches, the entire sequence should be unbroken for the final 20 minutes of the episode.Â  I'm so excited for ti.
5195	JonDunn	2014-05-06	Yeah the longer the better. Â 
Â 
Â 
But there seem to be some other big stories in the episode like Stannis in Braavos and the Dreadfort. Â Plus all the KL scenes we see in the preview before the trial even starts. Â  I hope there's enough time left over for a 15-20 minute trialÂ
5196	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-06	Â 
I'd bet on some tense staredown between Tyrion and Tywin. I don't think trial by combat's Mountain involvement will be mentioned yet, they'll save this for next ep with Oberyn's I can be your champion probably being the ending there.


Yea I'm really hoping the ending to episode 7 is Oberyn revealing this to Tyrion. I don't want it to be common knowledge beforehand. It's more dramatic when Oberyn tells Tyrion. Plus it perfectly sets up the next episode where the duel occurs.

Â 
Personally I want the moondoor to be in finale, but it looks like it's going to be in episode 7, especially after the last episode. They have sped up Sansa's storyline and unless they find some sort of filler for her arc, pretty sure they will do moondoor in episode 7. Even if Alex Graves filmed it, it could easily be moved.Â

It looks so gooood!Â  
1. Yara attacking the DreadfortÂ  
2. Stannis at the Iron BankÂ 
3. A Small Council scene
4. Dany and Drogon's "leavings".
5. A Varys and Oberyn scene.
6. Tywin eating dinner, snack, lunch whatever (every Tywin scene so far has been good).
7. Tyrion's trial.
8. Jaime ranting about the trial being a farse.
9. Written by THE Bryan Cogman.
This could even be the new best non episode 9 episode. HYPE HYPE HYPE!

5201	Rhaegar I Targaryen	2014-05-06	Konradsmith, you seem to have a good sense of where things are going with regards to the Bolton storyline.Â 
If you had to guess the outcome of Yara's attack, what would it be?Â
5202	Konradsmith	2014-05-06	^
	Spoiler That's the thing. Moat Caillin, given the guy playing Ralf Kenning being in a Alex Graves episode, is either episode eight or ten or both. So that is why we see Reek in his old Greyjoy armour in the first trailer and where we'll see that shot of Roose and Ramsay meeting with two groups of men. That means they must have successfully dealt with Yara's attack if they are able to then leave the Dreadfort behind and head down to the Neck. I guess Yara will have to survive because Asha is still alive and has the Kingsmoot and all of that. But I can't see Ramsay just letting her go either. But they couldn't have her prisoner during Moat Caillin because then they'd send her with the white flag, not Theon because Balon values her more than him. So my guess is she escapes somehow but her force is destroyed.

Sounds plausible, thanks!
5204	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-06	Um, I was talking about the 7th episode being weak by GoT Standards. Thanks,Â Guard of the Rainking. It's an opinion. I already had posted I thought episode 6 would be much better.
5205	JonDunn	2014-05-06	It's weird that some people are going to be mad if Yara lives and call the whole thing useless filler. Â  I much prefer her living than dying and completely changing the Greyjoy/North story. Â or becoming fake Arya.
Â 
Just let her escape and go back to the Iron Islands for a good Kingsmoot to start season 5. Â With Balon likely dying to end this season or start nextÂ

Â 
Other than the happenings of Episode 8 "The Mountain and the Viper," this is one of the scenes I'm most looking forward too.Â 
Â
5207	jet199	2014-05-06	We won't get Shae, the "guilty of being a dwarf" speech or the demand for trial by combat in the next episode. They are just teasing us with the "how do you plead" quote which marks the start if the trial, not the end. We will just get some set up with the trial going badly and people lining up to testify against Tyrion.
5208	Arkash	2014-05-06	Again, I'm quite sure Yara will end up back at the Iron Islands for the end of the season after Balon's death and this whole story arc is too make the viewer root for her at the Kingsmoot and have the Bolton do something before Winterfell.
5209	Konradsmith	2014-05-06	I've said this before on another thread but one thing that could happen would be if Ramsay set the dogs on Yara (say she got away on foot or maybe Ramsay was just stupid enough to catch her and then risk her escape so he could play his game) andÂ kills one of the poochesÂ with the blade she keeps between her breasts.

She could escape by sea with a few of her men (Qarl the Maid and Tris Botley equivilents) only to run into Stannis - the distances between Asha and Stannis as it stands now are small. Obviously, in this scenario, the Kingsmoot  doesnt happen, or occurs without Asha... with the second option, this provides a reason for it to be invalidated, since in the Show Theon is known to be alive by Balon at the very least. Just throwing ideas out there.
5211	Arkash	2014-05-06	^ Konradsmith : I'd love that and it would tie back to Ramsay's first scene of the season and be quite an intense scene.
5212	HelenaExMachina	2014-05-06	We won't get Shae, the "guilty of being a dwarf" speech or the demand for trial by combat in the next episode.

In the trailer where Tywin says "do you confess" (paraphrase) amd Tyrion rises, that is what makes me think of the "guilty of being a dwarf" speech. Iirc, that is similar to the preceding line in the books

Could happen. Although I expect the last we'll see of Stannis this season before the Wall will be in Braavos.

Â 
Or she could take a minor arrow wound and use the head to kill the dogs/Myranda? That would be pretty badass to.

'the guilty of...' thing is definitely in next ep. The last shot of the promo is the very beginning of this moment.
5216	HelenaExMachina	2014-05-06	Could happen. Although I expect the last we'll see of Stannis this season before the Wall will be in Braavos.
Yes, I thought of that as I posted actually 
However, I do quite like the idea that this storylije is to get her to the East side of Westeros, perhaps to set her up for capture by Stannis in S5 or even involve her in the Rickon Stark storyline (assuming there is a significant storyline)
5217	Guard of the Rainking	2014-05-06	^Yeah it looks like a good one. Plus it's a reunion of the creative team behind "What is Dead May Never Die", Sakharov and Cogman.


That episode is so underrated. Theon's decision, Myrcella's marriage plans, "power resides where men believe it resides", Yoren's monologue and Yoren's death. All of those scenes didn't heavily rely on the books and were great because of great directing and great writing.
5218	Seneti	2014-05-06	'the guilty of...' thing is definitely in next ep. The last shot of the promo is the very beginning of this moment.


Â 
Also, I do not know who it was, but in the episode 5 promo thread someone pointed out that so far the last shot of the promo is from the first scene of the actual episode. Meaning we'll probably start with Tyrion's trial.

Wouldn't mind seeing her kill Myranda, but I gotta feeling Ramsay's got dibs on that one.

5221	Konradsmith	2014-05-06	^Yeah it was, but I didn't make up that observation. I first read that on wicnet, I believe. As for the promos, the last shot we saw in it last week's was from the last scene, but I don't think that's a pattern that's been consistent so far through the season.

No.
5224	JonDunn	2014-05-06	Come on people. Â  Yara is not going to 'run into Stannis'

I already acknowledged this after my initial post, I was just floating ideas around. It is still possible that this arc sets her up to be captured by Stannis next season, if the Kingsmoot is missed out (which would.be a shame imo, i love that chapter  ) or to keep her closer to the main Northern storylines (Dreadfort and Winterfell, Eastwatch/Castle Black, White Harbour, Davos, potentially Rickon and Osha).
5226	Khal-a-bunga	2014-05-06	I didn't realize this episode was being directed by Alik Sakharov, and sinceÂ What Is Dead May Never Die is one of my favorite episodes of the show, I'm all the more excited for this upcoming episode.Â 
Â 
In terms of what we're going to see, I'm most anticipating the trial, the story line with Yara, and - of course - Stannis dealing with the Bank of Braavos. Also, more Varys, and in a scene with Oberyn, no less. Anyone thinking we might get a little foreshadowing for either Quentyn or (f)Aegon in this episode?Â 
Â 
It'd make sense. Especially considering the look Oberyn gives Tywin when he mentions Dany and her dragons inÂ Breaker of Chains.

Yea there's no way for a scene with Oberyn and Varys to be anything less than awesome.
5228	Konradsmith	2014-05-06	How very season 1 of them to have a small council meeting preceded by or followed by two of the council's members milling about in the throne room.

Â 
Hahahaha, I know ! But let's face it, didnt we miss it ? =D
Â 
I wonder in which order it will play out : Small Council - Varys / Oberyn - Tywin / Jaime, or if the latter will be before the council.
5230	Konradsmith	2014-05-06	Either way it will harken back to the classic milling around/world-building/character establishing/expositioning of season 1. Which I liked btw.
Â 
I do hope Varys talks about the sack of KL with Oberyn. Just the slightest glint in his eye when hearing about the Targaryen babes would do wonders. Or maybe they should lay out some clues now so it doesn't come completely out of the blue next season.

5234	go joff go	2014-05-06	I think the trial will so an over two episodes. I have a hard time believing that they can fit both cersei and sheas testimony into one episode
5235	Khal-a-bunga	2014-05-06	^ Agreed. I think they'll hit the audience with Shae's return, Bronn refusing to fight The Mountain, and Oberyn offering to be Tyrion's champion all in the seventh episode.Â

What in seven hells is "feel good" about the next few episodes?
5239	Konradsmith	2014-05-06	The Mountain will in episode seven for sure. And obviously eight. Whether Thor Bjornsson's third appearance (he said so in a bodybuilding magazine someone on wicnet read) is in ep. six or ten, we have yet to find out.
5240	Rhaegar I Targaryen	2014-05-06	Nice, I hope it's 6. I'm ready to see what the big fellas got.Â 

I'm assuming they would voice over his parts, he has a very thick accent.Â
5241	Konradsmith	2014-05-06	^I've said before that I hope Rory McCann voices him so we get some Clegane consistency. I would prefer if his third appearance was in episode ten though 
	Spoiler  people will want to see him suffer after what he does in episode eight. I hope Ellaria visits the wounded Gregor andÂ taunts him about Oberyn poisoning his spearhead and then we get a taste of what horrors Qyburn is doing to him.

5242	Arkash	2014-05-06	It would be a good episode ending with the Mountain. After Shae's confession, Tyrion is at his lowest and Cersei announces her champion when Tyrion asks about a trial by combat and have it all ready : enters the Mountain. Reactions. End of episode on a very ominous sound (ala 1x08 when Sansa pleads for her father in the Throne Room, this music is amazing !)

					
					
							Edited by Arkash, 06 May 2014 - 11:42 PM.
5243	Stark11	2014-05-06	I can't remember in the books if the trial spans over a few days or not but if they are trying to do the trial in "one" day on the show then I have no idea where they would cut it off between EP 6 & 7. 
I do think if it's in one episode thought the last 15-20 minutes would be all trial. That would leave EP 7 with a lot of cell visitors for Tyrion (Bronn, Oberyn, Jaime or Tywin maybe?)
5244	Cold Hands warm heart	2014-05-07	Remember this being the show, I am thinking we may have some more changes from what we read in the books. The Iron Bank is becoming more prominent, Asha has a new role, these should continue their course, expanding. Where and with whom will Asha/Yara be when and IF Balon dies. Stannis has a lot of battles to fight and win. Perhaps Asha meets Jon before meeting Stannis. Oh and I want this new rule implemented, the season ending episodes are to be 2 hours in length.
5245	iago	2014-05-07	I wonder if the title of episode 7, "Mockingbird" is, in addition to the obvious significance, an indication that Shae's testimony will be in that episode rather than this Sunday. The ultimate "mocking" for Tyrion.
5246	Seneti	2014-05-07	I think it was Konrad and I think he was talking about 'previously on...' clip.

It looks like it considering we have that man standing before Dany holding a bundle, and the quick glimpse of Drogon.
5251	Tom son of Tom	2014-05-07	I'm looking forward to Tyrion's "I should have let Stannis burn you all" line.

Man! I can't figure out what the heck they are going to do with her story now?Something supposedly happens in Ep.10 , I am still guessing it has to do with dragons.(Yeah! E9 will be the show stopper this year, but hints about E10 from the show runners and Alex Graves already)
5253	King Tommen	2014-05-07	In the HBO Viewer guide on their site, all 3 dragons are named (they are under the Targaryen family tree as Dany's children, cute).

I'm quite sure it will be the opening scene. Hazzeah and Drogon then cut to Dany holding court in the pyramid.

5256	sati	2014-05-07	I'm looking forward to Tyrion's "I should have let Stannis burn you all" line.
Can't remember which preview I saw it in but the line itself without context was intense.


It sounds like an amazing moment - Tyrion sounded so pissed off and bitter when he said that. It was used in that Weeks Ahead promo that's still only available in low quality :/
5257	The Onion Sleight	2014-05-07	^ Huh, which promo do you mean? (I can't remember this, but it sounds like a great scene!)

That just reminded me. Davos hasn't said his "as long as Stannis lives, the war is not over" line. Maybe he says it Â to Tycho?

I remember it last year after Second Sons- I don't remember any two weeks of my life passing as slowly as those  But, of course, Rains of Castamere was well worth the wait! I'm completely sure The Mountain and the Viper will be too.
5265	The Onion Sleight	2014-05-07	@Guard of the Rainking: I think, the "As long as Stannis lives..." was actually also used by Jaime in 4x01, when Joffrey said, he broke Stannis at the Blackwater and then Jaime answered that the war is not won and as long as Stannis lives, it's not over. We already heard Davos also saying in a trailer that "the war is not over" and now he and Jaime seem to agree (with the same words) that this is because of Stannis :-) (He could say it to Tycho maybe, yes)

I cannot freaking believe after 4x06 it will be a month for me to see another Stannis scene again because of showunners trying to make his next scene as surprising as possible + damn hiatus. I'll probably watch Blackwater like 4 times in the meantime
5267	The Onion Sleight	2014-05-07	God, I'm SOOO EXTREME excited for this episode!!!
Finally all the stuff I waited for since the season began happens (Aaaargh, I can't wait for the Dreadfort and Braavos! I'm so hyped for Stannis, Davos, Tycho/Mycroft, Asha, Theon and Ramsay; Oh, how I've missed them all... The trial and Drogon will also be very good, I guess).
This is the episode I've been looking forward the most (beside episode 9 and 10), I'm so interested about the outcomes for the IBoB and Greyjoys plots (I finally want to know which of the theories about these storylines are true).
If the scenes will be good, this episode has potential to become one of my favourites!

... But for now I'm looking forward to 4x06, since Stannis, Davos, Theon and Asha are four of my Top 6 favourite characters (and Gatiss is one of my favourite actors / show writers) and they looked wonderful in the preview!

But as for finale - Tyrion's last ASOS chapter is my fav in book series and I cannot wait for Stoneheart, Stannis will be in ep too, Only Cat, Children of the Forest - yeah I can see it becoming the absolute best.

HBO's absolutely doing it for ratings, but it makes sense. A lot of people (myself included) go away for Memorial Day Weekend. If they were showing an episode, I might bring my tablet and HBOGO it up, but I also just might wait until I got back and watch it on a different day. It's just not a convenient night for an episode for a lot of Americans. But we have to wait an additional week too? We just might be slightly more distracted that Sunday.

Â That whole Cogman likes Stannis thing is a myth. http://winteriscomin...theon-and-more/
Â 
Some might find his responses adequete, but I don't. I think Cogman's responses, and the questions raised by the interviewer, don't properly address the issues that Stannis fans find most problematic with the adaptation. (Lack of a warm relationship with Davos, Melisandre saving Davos at the end of season 3, thus completely usurping Stannis of any agency, his one dimensional lust for power and lack of adherence to duty) Cogman also wrote Stannis' scenes in Mhysa, which are arguably the worst in the entire adaptation of the character, so I'm so confused why people think he's such a great writer. He also thought it would be a cool idea to put baby fetuses in jars during Selyse's episode 5 scene (although I like the Shireen stuff), for no other reason than he thought it would be cool.
Â 
You've got plenty of people on the forum that think Stannis' fans are whiners, and that none of our criticisms are valid, but I think that after seeing episode 2 where he burns people without any intelligble reason other than religous fanaticism, people are finally starting to get it. All that being said, Stannis looks very promising in this upcoming episode, and despite the fact that they have effectively ruined many compelling aspects of the character, there is still a chance to see the "King Who Still Cared" if they play up his choice to save the Wall a little bit more. After all they've taken away from the character, this really has to be Stan's victory though, and if they dilute it, then I think we can safely say that the showrunners are biased towards the character to a degree that is completely unprofessional.
5280	Konradsmith	2014-05-07	^Cogman didn't write his scenes in Mhysa. He mapped out how the Stannis storyline would go for season 3, but he only wrote the scenes in "Kissed By Fire".

Anyways though, there are plenty of threads about Stannis. Obviously he features in the promo and his storyline is something to speculate over but let's not turn this thread into a complain-athon.

Fair enough. Though if he mapped out how the arc went down, then the big decisions which proved detrimental to the character are still on him, even if he didn't write every piece of dialogue himself. But getting back to the preview, I like the look of Davos and Stannis sailing to Braavos, and actor who's playing Tycho. Season 4 has not had a real good start in my opinion, but I'm really hopeful after last Sunday's episode that the show is headed for a turn around, and I mean that in more ways than just their handling of Stannis.

5286	Konradsmith	2014-05-07	I think its been the tightest, most cinematic season so far myself, Thelastactionhero (I mean compare its first five episodes to the first five of seasons 1, 2 and 3) and I prefer show Stannis to book Stannis (though mostly because of Stephen Dillane rather than the writing). That said I doÂ think that StanStans will like episode six. Also, Tyrion saying "I should've let Stannis kill you all" will seem like a backhanded "endorsement" to some unsullied.

Stephen Dillane is the real bright spot in this whole thing. The reason that the character might be salvageable in my eyes is precisesly because Dillane's acting gives Stannis that level of complexity and nuance that the showrunners refuse to. There are things I like about Season 4 (Oberyn is so well done), but I think the violence towards women has gotten overly gratuitous, beyond the point of poignant social commentary, and I still feel disatisfied with a lot of the deviations in the source material (and not just because I hate what they've done with Stannis). Episode 5 was surprisingly a high point for me though, especially in terms of original material, and I think while it was mainly filler, it definitely gave the characters something more interesting to do than sit around at Castle Black or starve in the woods. Arya and the Hound probably have the best scenes out of anyone this season though, and perhaps the best on screen chemistry of any two actors in the entire adaptation.Â

To be completely honest I didn't find his scene there to be that bad - I read it as him burning them for disobeying their King. It was clear he didn't feel comfortable with the whole thing and thanks to them showing his love for Shireen in dinner scene I liked the way they handled him. BUT if they screw up his ep.9 scene I'll be outraged and I'll never praise the writing on the show again. The way they are handling Dany (she's basically Jesus) and Cersei (acting all weak and defeated, where is evil,manipulating Cersei?) this season is already bad, For them to ruin such an awesome moment would be just a colossal fuck up and a disservice to the show as it's the climax of the battle. I don't think they'll ruin it.

5291	Arkash	2014-05-07	^ I agree. Episode 7 should end on the Oberyn and Tyrion conversation in the cell. Bronn will come talk to Tyrion earlier in the episode.

I'm a fan of Dany in the books, but yeah, she's awful in the series. Her crucifying the wise masters was the first drop of nuance I'd seen in her since season 2. I took particular offense at how smoothly her invasions of various cities went, especially after Jorah spent all that time explaining to her that lots of innocent people die when you sack a city. Episode 4 had a slave revolt that went off without a single hitch, to the point where it's so unrealistic that it's actually more annoying than it is compelling. As for Cersei, I think they're trying to make her more sympathetic, as they've done in the past, to create more tension when she goes on her crazy rampage as queen regent.
Â 
And while I love what they've done with Shireen, him burning innocent men for such a petty reason, however uncomfortable it might have made him feel, felt like a real slap in the face to the character to me. Wouldn't have taken too much time to give Stannis a more valid reason to execute Axel/Alester like he does in the books, and I think the emphasis they placed on his religous fantaticism was very telling, especially after watching the inside of the episode interviews where Weiss reinforces this point that he's gone "full Melisandre". Like I said though, maybe we'll get some Stan and Dave bromancing this Sunday. That's really the biggest thing his arc is missing.

Dany is portrayed as some sort of angel in the show which makes her character really boring. It doesn't help that her big moment this season - the catapult thing in front of the gates of Meereen - was a completely uninspired rehash of Dracarys scene. As for Cersei - I did praise them for their attempts at making the character complex in the past, but the thing is in previous seasons there was plenty of villainous Cersei to balance it out - this season she just walks around with defeated look on her face. She looks vicious in promo for ep. 6 so I'm hopeful. I appreciate their efforts and Lena is amazing with showing all the nuances but for the love of God, some Unsullied friends of mine claim that Cersei is a better person than Stannis. That is horrific.
Â 
I just hope considering what it's in store in his upcoming story they won't have that much freedom to try and ruin him just because they don't understand him.
5299	iheartseverus	2014-05-07	Anybody have any idea how, I mean using what formula, will Tyrion be found guilty?Â  Would it take 2 out of 3 judges?Â Â Â  1 out of 3?Â  Small council vote?Â  Unanimous show of hands?Â  I guess we won't know until we see it.Â  IIRC, the only other 'trial' we've seen was at crazy Lysa's.Â  This upcoming one seems more rationally set up, especially having Tywin tell Cersei he couldn't discuss the case with her.Â  (Which made me laugh right there, it was so Mr. Tulkinghorn!)

Oh I loved that scene in WIDMND!
Â 
I kinda worry they'll end the ep with Shae walking in as cliffhanger. It's been a while since I read that chapter so I don't know if 'I'm guilty of being a dwarf' speech, which definitely happens this Sunday, was before or after that.

I'm so hoping for Oberyn having a blast during trial like in the book ^^
5301	Konradsmith	2014-05-07	^I think he said his "guilty of being a dwarf" business after saying "get this whore out of my sight".
Â 
As for D and D not understanding Stannis, I don't think that's the case. The problem might beÂ thinking ofÂ the two writers, who write separately and then mesh their scenesÂ together into "co-written" episodes,Â as being on the same page. I think interviews show that Benioff and Weiss have different conceptions of the character. Neither hate him, though Benioff seems to like him more. Weiss did comment on the brilliant humour of Stannis and how Dillane nails it in one of the commentaries. But in interviews its normally Weiss with something harsh to say about Stan and Benioff who smiles slightly as if he's smitten with our king.

I really hope they keep the bit where Shae says Tyrion did horrible sexual things to her, and Oberyn leans forward and says something like 'oh yeah? Like what?' It was so hilarious.
5303	Konradsmith	2014-05-07	^Indeed it was. Such an aloof bastard. I love the glimpse of him in the Small Council meeting with his feet pretty much up on the table.

5304	oierem	2014-05-07	Sati, I'd say at least the bulk of the trial will be in this episode, given what it's named. We don't have to hear the full testimony of every witness, just Shae really. Maybe Varys and Pycelle's accounts will be blended and harken back to the switcheroo camera trickery in Sakharov and Cogman's "the Queen mustn't know" scene in WIDMND.


That would be a great way to do the trial scene! A huge irony, using a twisted and perverse version of Tyrion's trick on Tyrion himself.

Â 
Whatever the case may be I don't think they are being fair here - they took out so many brilliant lines and all those little things that could get people who watch the show to like Stannis a bit more. In any case I think they show favoritism for some characters - Tyrion, Dany - and some characters are just there because they can't get rid of them. Sure, it's their show, their right, but I don't think it's being fair to fanbase and source material - they are free to do what they want but I'm free not to like their decisions 
Â 
I still like Stannis on the show, but hey, Dillane plays him so I couldn't be less objective here ^^
Â

Â 
I really hope they keep that! He was so amused by her testimony. It also looks like him attending Small Council meeting will be fun - he's so chill in that promo
5306	Arkash	2014-05-07	Anybody have any idea how, I mean using what formula, will Tyrion be found guilty?Â  Would it take 2 out of 3 judges?Â Â Â  1 out of 3?Â  Small council vote?Â  Unanimous show of hands?Â  I guess we won't know until we see it.Â  IIRC, the only other 'trial' we've seen was at crazy Lysa's.Â  This upcoming one seems more rationally set up, especially having Tywin tell Cersei he couldn't discuss the case with her.Â  (Which made me laugh right there, it was so Mr. Tulkinghorn!)


Â 
I think it will be hand-rasing from the judges. It could be good visual.Â 
Â 
Having some pause during the trial as the judges exit to discuss privately between the testimonies and end on a vote could work.
Â 
Especially if Cogman and Sakharov play it like they did in season 2 in WIDMND.
Â 
By the way, who do we think will testify against Tyrion in the show ?
Â 
I'd bet for : Meryn Trant, Pycelle, Margaery, Varys, Bronn, Jaime, Cersei, Shae.
Â 
I know it's a lot but if they pull it off it could be amazing !

Â 
He does! But I think he's alone when Jaime visits him...but it would be awesome if there was some other reason for them showing us him eat...
Â 
Oh I will. My tumblr will probably explode after ep.9.
5313	Ankou	2014-05-07	Stephen Dillane is the real bright spot in this whole thing. The reason that the character might be salvageable in my eyes is precisesly because Dillane's acting gives Stannis that level of complexity and nuance that the showrunners refuse to. There are things I like about Season 4 (Oberyn is so well done), but I think the violence towards women has gotten overly gratuitous, beyond the point of poignant social commentary, and I still feel disatisfied with a lot of the deviations in the source material (and not just because I hate what they've done with Stannis). Episode 5 was surprisingly a high point for me though, especially in terms of original material, and I think while it was mainly filler, it definitely gave the characters something more interesting to do than sit around at Castle Black or starve in the woods. Arya and the Hound probably have the best scenes out of anyone this season though, and perhaps the best on screen chemistry of any two actors in the entire adaptation.Â 


When Stannis castrates all rapists, things will be more balanced.Â
5314	Konradsmith	2014-05-07	I can't wait for Jaime and Tywin part two. People who were underwhelmed by their head-to-head in "Two Swords". This is why they didn't release their full ire on one another. They were saving it for Cogman.

Well, in the books, there were some more nuanced testimonies. Cersei deliberatly started slow before making appear witnesses with stories more and more gruesome until Shae.

They should really make a mention of it on the show, with all the rape scenes outrage going on.

To my thinking, anyone who's going into a thread that's labeled a preview of stuff they haven't seen yet, is actively looking for spoilers.Â  As to book spoilers vs. show spoilers, IMHO, that amounts to the same thing.Â  The only way anyone can discuss what's coming up in episodes no one has seen yet, is to refer to what happens in the books and then extrapolate that into how the show may or may not handle it.Â  Again, just my opinion, but I think if Ran or the other Mods saw it differently, they would have tacked a 'Book Spoiler' warning on these threads.
5322	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-07	I kinda worry they'll end the ep with Shae walking in as cliffhanger. It's been a while since I read that chapter so I don't know if 'I'm guilty of being a dwarf' speech, which definitely happens this Sunday, was before or after that.


Â 
Maybe Shae is the "Mockingbird" in episode 7.
5323	Father of Dragons	2014-05-07	As for episode 8 I hope they end it on the Wall and start episode 10 at the Wall (as it's a tradition of the episodes 9 - 10 in the show so far).
No, no, no! Episode 8 will definitely end with Oberyn and the Mountain.
By the way, who do we think will testify against Tyrion in the show ?
Â 
I'd bet for : Meryn Trant, Pycelle, Margaery, Varys, Bronn, Jaime, Cersei, Shae.
Â 
I know it's a lot but if they pull it off it could be amazing !

Ser Meryn: They've kinda ignored him recently. He gets like one or two lines every season.
Pycelle: Oh yeah, we'll be getting him
Margaery: I doubt it, she doesn't have much reason to. She and Cersei (despite this week) don't get along so she wouldn't be convinced by her.
Varys: Of course.
Bronn: I don't think we'll be seeing him. His relationship with Tyrion in the show is more friendly
Jaime: Definitely not. He even says "This trial is a farce!" He'd be the ultimate hypocrite.
Cersei: Probably
Shae: I think they may save her for episode 7
My theory is that this episode we'll see the minor people (Pycelle, maybe Ser Meryn, maybe Cersei) and there's a chance Varys is this week. If he isn't, they'll start next week with him. I think it'll be (1)Varys, (2)Bronn and Tyrion, (3) Shae and (4) Oberyn and Tyrion.
5324	iheartseverus	2014-05-07	^They haven't had many war-cries yet in the show.


Oh, I think Tyrion's 'Those are brave men out there--lets go kill them!' and Stannis' own 'Come with me and take this city!'Â  were pretty exciting rallying cries.
5325	Arkash	2014-05-07	Â Jaime: Definitely not. He even says "This trial is a farce!" He'd be the ultimate hypocrite.
Â 

Â 
Yet we have seen shots in tihe promo of him and Cersei face to face during the trial, so something will play out there.

Yes, his only dialogue will probably be making a fool of himself on the small council meeting

5333	Konradsmith	2014-05-07	Well, so it goes with Mace. But he'll inject some fun to the proceedings. I've rewatched "First of His Name" a few times and I've picked up on some of the stuff he was saying during the coronation. It's pretty funny.

Well, his daughter is the queen because of her and his mother.
Anyway, I think D&D are going to go with the stereotypical portrayal of Mace by the way Olenna speaks about him. "Lord Oaf of Highgarden". They will make him appear more stupid than he is. Also, I do agree that he is not as stupid as others say, but still pretty stupid.

Smart enough to back the play and not ruin the plan. That puts him above most of the characters. I mean how many characters had a good thing going and ruined it? Robb, Joffrey, Cersei, Tywin, Tyrion, Ned, Robert Baratheon, Drogo, Dany, Quentyn, Oberyn, etc etc

5341	The Dragon has three heads	2014-05-07	The Ironborn and Ramsays troops look fairly even in number in that scene, and the Ironborn guys seem to be better armed and armored and are supposedly the "best killers on the Iron Islands" 
Interested to see how that plays out in anyway that makes sense and interested to see where Asha ends up. I also think it's odd Balon let his last chance for an heir run off on such a dangerous mission with such a little amount of men. The whole situation is odd.

It's not a good idea/plot line IMO
Yara travelled all the way around westeros to end up at the dread fort-one of the strongest castles in the north to storm it with...10 men? Cool.
5342	Hath4	2014-05-07	Well I guess not as strong as we thought sense yara gets in and releases reek from his kennel cell. I guess ramsays fun has depleted the castle force. That and a lot of the Bolton force left to fight in the war and are trapped south of the moat.

I agree. It's not that hard. The two years are over. Name the goddamn babies already.
Â 


And HBO are not doing it out of respect, but for better ratings.
I don't mean any offence or any disrespect to anyone here but it's not very fair on anyone "across the water" that we have to wait an additional week, but I do understand the reasons, of course.


Â 
Agreed but that's just the way things are. I'm probably gonna binge on the first half of season 4 during that weekend.
5344	Fuse Prime	2014-05-07	Do you have some examples?


Â 
I think the fact that he continued to lay siege to Storm's End, despite the fact that his force was commanded north to the Trident. Â He could have left with a sizable majority of his ground forces. Â Do you think that maybe things could have turned out differently had he done so? Â I do. Â Hell, he may have even joined forces with Tywin's armies, before Tywin decided to sack King's Landing. Â
5345	Thelastactionhero	2014-05-07	Â 
Â 
I just hope considering what it's in store in his upcoming story they won't have that much freedom to try and ruin him just because they don't understand him.


This is my thought as well. I'm sure they'll make him look more evil than he actually is when he deals with Jon, but is there really a way to make Stannis look bad when saves the Wall? It's one of the defining moments of the series, and two of the leading protagonists and few moral compasses left in the series (Jon and Sam) come to respect him as a result. It's also hard not to root for him when he's fighting the Boltons, though to be honest, he ain't all that much better than them in this adaptation as far as I'm concerned, with the exception of his love for Shireen. Really does go a long way in humanzing him, just no near far enough.
Â 

	Marwynning -
I doubt they'll include that tidbit about him castrating the rapists. Takes too much screen time away from the orgies. There certainly wasn't enough time to clarify the fact that he was burning the guy who tried to sell his daughter to the Lannisters.
5346	CandleWisps	2014-05-07	I hope we get as much sassy Oberyn, well as much Oberyn in general, as possible in his last remaining episodes. He is on my list of top ten faves and over the summer, before and after his casting, etc, I've been ranting to my mom about his awesome badassery nonstop.

Well that is the general problem with "hyping things up" for people. Nothing will ever be able to live up to the picture of awesomeness that forms in your head. I've had so many people tell me that Full Metal Alchemist (1st adaptation) and Neon Genesis Evangelion were the best animes ever produced, that by the time I did watch them, my only verdict was "not impressed at all". Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood (2nd adaption) on the other hand completely wowed me. If you really love a character/show, then the best you can do for them is tell people that they are your favorite and then leave it at that. Also keep in mind that some of the awesomeness only comes later in time (e. g. Stannis being a relative non-entity before coming to the Wall).

Â 
Unrelated, but I found FMA Brotherhood much more up my alley than the first series too, I guess because Brotherhood actually followed the manga source material.
Â 
And yes, I've been waiting for Stannis' Wall moment for a couple years now, just so I could get my mom out of her mindset that Stannis is evil and useless. The addition of the journey to Braavos has me victory dancing for more opportunities for Stannis mojo to shine through Â  Â Â 
And part of the reason I adore Oberyn so much has to do with his history, the raising of his daughters, plotting with his brother, connection with Elia, etc., so when we got that long awaited mention of the Sand Snakes last episode I jumped for joy at some connection for viewers to make with him other than he is 'legendary' and plays for both teams. Being an on-screen adaptation, I know my version of his BAMF level most likely won't be lived up to because we don't get as much history on the show in general.
Â 
Personality wise, I feel Pascal nails Oberyn perfectly, and that sassy IDGAF moment with the Small Council in the upcoming ep has had me giggling for a few days now. This episode can not come fast enough Â  Â
5349	hedgeknight001	2014-05-08	I'm not worried about realism or unrealism and I'm not in disagreement with any of their decisions. All I do is wonder. Undoubtedly she was angry, undoubtedly she will be bitter. That is not, however, the thing that interests me. It's a considerable step from a very personal grudge to what will take place behind the scenes leading up to the trial and beyond
I always thought that was one of the better (& more tragic) story lines in Asoiaf -- a gold-digging whore thinks she finds true love, but then is seized by a higher power and (most probably) told, testify against Tyrion and continue enjoying the good life but without him, or have your throat slit.
Poor Tyrion. Poor whore.

5350	salmonsnake	2014-05-08	It will indeed be intriguing how they will imply, in the trial scene, what took place behind the scenes: was she forced to testify, did she do it with a degree of willingness, or will she look like she's fully committed to having him executed.
5351	jentario	2014-05-08	Cannot wait to see the Dreadfort scene
Â 
I doubt Ramsay would go into battle with no armor whatsoever though that seems nuts


Yara probably catches him off guard, and he is nuts...
Â 
Anyway, this looks potentially like the best episode yet. I am loving the pleasure on Stannis's face (is the redemption finally beginning now?) and just separating him from Melisandre will do a great job at developing his character. Moving on, DROGON! Finally some dragon action! Could this be THAT scene? I thought a certain related character is set to appear in episode 8? Anyway, the Meereen Throne room looks badass and Dany looks beautiful as ever. Then there's the trial- wow, those scenes are fucking amazing in the books! And this is a BCog episode, so it's safe to say the trial itself will be very similar to the book counterpart. And then we've got one of my most anticipated scenes of the season- Yara attacks the Dreadfort! Unlike the Craster's detour, we really can't know how this one will end. It could go in so many different ways... Which is awesome! But not nearly as awesome as the fact that Yara will be fighting Ramsay! Wow, that will just be great to watch. These two characters will finally prove what they can do (and I do love me some Asha/Yara).
Â 
This is THE episode I've been waiting for.
Seriously. After that we'll be moving on to the season enders, which will be epic of course. 8, 9 and 10 will be a trifecta of nerdgasms.
But episode 6 is the final midseason build-up episode. After that, we plunge right into the madness that is the end of ASOS.
5352	Konradsmith	2014-05-08	^The Goatherd's CV credits him as appearing in an Alex Graves-directed episode, so presumably eight or ten. And yet that shot of Drogon looks like the same one from the trailer and vine video where he's poised to attack a young boy. So, I dunno. I wonder what will happen when.

5353	King Tyrion I	2014-05-08	I guess I'll be torn in my sympathies for Tyrion - and Tywin.
Â 
And yes, I'm also looking forward to that Dreadfort scene. Asha and Ramsay.
5354	hedgeknight001	2014-05-08	Are you kidding?! First of all, there is no such thing as "good guys" and "bad guys", but even if there was: are Ygritte and Shae "bad guys"? Will you be happy to see the Hound "die"? And not seeing anymore the most badass character of them all - Tywin - will be a very sad thing. No, my friend, this is a very sad season indeed.
Sure there's good and bad characters in Asoif, despite GRRM's protestations. The Mountain. Joffrey. Biter. Hoat, the list is endless. They're all basically soulless serial killers. Or, if you prefer, orcs.
Ygritte is a murderer, so, yep, she ends up being a bad guy. So is The Hound, if for nothing else, murdering the baker's boy. Be happy to see him die, he deserves it. Tywin is an amoral sociopath. Good riddance.
But, then again, I really don't feel strongly about it, it's just obvious that there is good & bad. In truth, it's simply not possible to have morality in a fantasy-land of the undead, wargs, living gods of ice and fire, and black magic.
I just tune in for the swordplay and the dragons anyway.

Hells yeah. So far, this looks like a really fun deviation. I just hopes it ends up with Yara back on track where she is in the books.
5356	SM4e	2014-05-08	It also looks like there will be plenty of support for Tyrion from Jaime, I love these two together.

Â 
4x10 will be heartbreaking. 
Â 
By the way, regarding Stannis: I do hope that they'e showing Stannis kinda villanous while showing Daenerys like Jesus Chris-reborn, so that his turning out to be a good king and her turning out to be a bad queen (and maybe even the ultimate villain) will be more impactful. But that's just wishful thinking I suppose.

Â 
it will be tough in the show...D&D have openly stated to not show Stannis in a good light...and i think the unsullied audience are too impressed with her and even her mistakes, they seem to sympathize rather thanÂ  
Â 
if they do manage to pull it off, would be a very amazing shift of character to watch
5358	Phil Sand	2014-05-08	Here's how I want the episode to end:
The Mountain walks into the throne room when Cersei names him as her champion.
Â 
Oberyn sees Clegane, slowly stands up, nodding, and the episode ends.
Â 
Ehh... it looks better in my head than when I read my post.


Perfect even if it doesn't happen how you explained, i just want the mountain to be named champion then cut to oberyn with a look of glee in his eyes.

lolll. This. The thing is, I had really high hopes for Stannis because of how nuanced they portrayed him in Season 2. He was dark, did questionable things, but the redemptive qualities of the character were evident enough for us to sympathize with him. I really do not want to get too optimistic about where they're taking him though, because his actions in Mhysa were so disappointing that it nearly ruined the entire episode for me, which of course concluded with Dany being hoisted onto the shoulders of a bunch of slaves proclaiming her as Jesus. That scene in particular was really troublesome for me, not only because the white savior thing is really getting out of hand, but because Dany in the books would never have let them hoist her up. She would have walked among them in that ending sequence to show how much she empathizes with the common man. If Beinoff was calling all the shots with Stannis, I'd have higher hopes, because I feel like he gets the character more, and seems to take a more professional distance from his own preferences when he's assessing things in his interviews. I really like the way this Braavos trip is looking though, and I'm hoping that at the very least, if nothing else, we see Davos and Stannis rekindle that warm friendship that's much more evident in the books. That's the kind of shit they need to get him back on track.
Â 
What's key to remember is that these are two fans interpreting the series, and they just happen to have a bigger budget than any of us do. They've done a splendid job with much of it, but they control what you see and how you see it, which is why these charges of character bias are not unwarranted. I get frustrated, not because I hate Dany or think she's evil, but because she's been cheapened as a character too by their one-dimensional depiction. There's still time to fix things if they just work harder to make the nuance more consistent across these two character arcs, and given where the source material is headed, that's almost how it has to go. Â 
Â 
Also, regarding the trial, do we think they can actually fit the entire event into this one episode? Just because it seems kind of jammed with so many other arcs. I could see it ending with him demanding trial by combat, but I could also see them stretching the trial out to into episode 7, depending on how many witnesses they choose to include.Â
5365	Moseh Khayim	2014-05-08	Everyone seems to believe Mel will not accompany Stannis on his little trip to Braavos and, while I agree, wouldn't it be interesting to have Mel tag along and let her pay a visit to the Red Temple? I definitely hope we're going to see some nice shots of Braavos (House of Black and White!).Â

5366	salmonsnake	2014-05-08	Well since trial is the last thing we see on the promo, this means it is very likely that the episode will start with the trial, and have, for example, Jaime confronting Tywin about the 'farce' it is afterwards. I guess it's also possible that they'll have another trial scene at a later point in the episode. I can't recall how it went in the book, was the trial in one session there?

The trial was in several sessions, and took place over a few days. Shae was the last testimony to be given, and this was on the morning of the trial by combat.

Â 
I'm getting the feeling going to start off the small council meeting and discussing what to do...then with Tywin asking Tyrion to confess, then probably Cersei and Varys testimonies...then jaime confronting tywin about the trial being a farce...
Â 
this is a build up for the Jamie/Tyrion scene last time where Jaime was convinced that Tyrion is innocent and that it will be proved in the Trial. Jaime's growing frustration at not being able to help his brother whom he knows to be innocent...
Â 
e7 will have some more witnesses, bronn and handmaidens and so forth and final nail on the coffin, Shae...somewhere during the recesses... enter the mountain...oberyn sees him for afar and goes to tyrion offering to be his champion...last scene of e7 tyrion asks for trial by combat cersei names Mountain and Oberyn stands up and volunteers..endÂ  Â

Yeah that seems really plausible. You think Bronn will actually be called up as a witness though? Would definitely be dramatic, but I kinda don't see them having that, just because they've gone above and beyond in order to make him super likeable (which he is). I feel like we'll get his scene with Tyrion in jail in episode 7 where he refuses to be his champion.

Â 
Â 
would be a time saver having him come to the prison...but it would feel extremely repetitive after Pod and Jamie as well...people might be like "ok ya we get it, Tyrions fukd and all alone"...all the haters especially would start yelling about "filler scenes" and all that...
Â 
while Bronn is definitely likable, he is still a sellsword, duplicitous by nature...so it would be better that he doesn't show up in Tyrion's cell, he's left wondering why and bam! witness for the prosecution!Â 
Â 
im confused about the order of witnesses though...what do you think?
Start off with the big guns, Cersei and Varys, then move on to others (including randoms and Bronn) and finally Shae?
Or start off with randoms and then varys and cersei followed by Shae?Â
5371	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-08	i'll confess i'm a bit worried about Bronn actually being called as a witness at all due to time constraints...but i think its really important since it will reinforce Jaime's "farce" comment (since jaime knows that bronn thinks tyrion is innocent, seeing him up there claiming the opposite will confirm his suspicions that Cersei's paid all the witnesses off)

Shae has to be last. It's the climax of the trial in my eyes. I think that order makes sense, cause its a gradual build up from people who clearly hate Tyrion to people he's friendly with/cares about throwing him under the bus. I still think Bronn will likely meet him in his cell, but I really like this idea of him actually testifying against Tyrion.

Maybe cersei's offer of marrying into house stokeworth will come on the condition that he testifies against Tyrion. Opposed to in the books, where he is offered the marriage only if he doesn't be tyrions champion.

Only a few weeks away from 'The Mountain and The Viper'..Â 
I've been waiting a very long time (as I'm sure most of you have) to see that scene play out on screen.
I think Sunday that Tywin will see this as his opportunity to literally rid himself of his shame.
By the end of the episode, Tyrion will seem doomed. (as if he doesn't already)
Then next week we'll get Oberyn's visit to The Little Lion..Â 
MAN.. Then we've got Stannis/THE WALL .. Lady Brienne and perhaps LADY S.. The battle on the wall..
Not to mention seeing how far Bran gets. And how much of Dany's dilly dallying will we get?

How much screen time will Ser Pounce get?
I'm genuinely excited..Â

Yeah, I don't want to hear anyone calling it whitewashing. Jamie would never keep Bronn at his side if he blatantly lies and betrays Tyrion. And since Illyn Payne's actor is sick with supposedly terminal cancer, we aren't getting Illyn. Better Bronn than nothing. Also, I'm really liking those two so far.

It always amuses me when they have the "Introducing new cast" and they have their 30 second talk about who they play before the season as to my knowledge only like 3 of the new characters ever got more than 4 lines. Most classic being the Blackfish in my mind

Â 
Very good idea !Â 
Â 
While Stannis and Davos go to the Iron Bank, it would be nice to use the opportunity to view more of Braavos via Mel, and what best than a Temple of Light ? A good scene and dialogue there could really develop her character and Carice said that it would happen this season, and since I'm sure we wont see them again till the end of episode 9 (and probably a great scene with Jon and Stannis in 10), now is the only time to see more of her.

5407	sati	2014-05-09	And where are the promo pics? :/ Oh God maybe I'll get 3rd promo pic of Stannis this year....this is so sad, it's almost funny - Dany fans have hundreds of pictures, Stannis fans have 2 + we are literally freaking out about the proper lightning in next episode in his scenes, first time this season

That huge chair makes Tycho look smaller than Tyrion. Three hats would have looked less silly.
Â 
I think they have gone too far removing colours and making everything drab. It's actually a bit old fashioned harking back to the nineties when neutrals, greys, browns and terracotta where in vogue. Bright colours would help define the characters more, and mean the unsullied could actually tell the difference between the Greyjoys and the Freys. It also affects character, we expect young and outgoing people to wear bright colour so Dany's bright blue dress works but Cersei looks too mumsy because they always put her burgundy rather than crimson. Bright yellow only enhances Oberyn's cockiness while Loras and Marg are made boring with that horrible wishy washy green.

Â 
Damn, I wasn't that excited for a recap since the Lost days !
Â 
So, according to the tradition of starting an episode with the last thing of the recap, we might open with Stannis. I would have thought it would be Drogon and Hazzezah.

5412	iheartseverus	2014-05-09	Hmmm, nothing unexpected in this recap...
5413	Arkash	2014-05-09	Well, it was funny they reminded us who are Meryn Trant, and what Tyrion has done to upset some people.
Â 
The Varys stuff is interesting. They remind us of him as an ally for Tyrion. It would be weird if they make him defend Tyrion. Varys is supposed to testify against him. The Spider has no older brother to protect him.
5414	iago	2014-05-09	I do think the recap confirms that this episode will have nothing to do with Moat Cailin, as it wasn't mentioned in the recap. Exclusively dreadfort. I bet/hope Roose departs at the beginning with a quick reminder to his son to get moving on that whole thing, then Yara attacks, which sparks Ramsay to head to the moat for 8 and 10

5415	Frey Pies	2014-05-09	Wow, the recap has me more excited for this episode than I've been since The Rains of Castamere. I'm gonna bet that this will turn out to be an even better non-episode 9 than Kissed By Fire. Looks amazing, and all four arcs in this look like the best each of the characters has had so far this season.
Â 
What we can expect from each arc:
Â 
Ramsay/Theon: shirtless Ramsey epic battle sequence, Yara freeing Theon, Ramsey getting him back, defeating Yara in some way
Â 
Stannis: setting sail for and arriving at Braavos, meeting with Tycho, maybe the Melisandre scene
Â 
Danaerys: first court meeting as ruler, maybe Hazzea, epic Drogon sequence!
Â 
Tyrion: testimonies by Pycelle, Meryn Trant, Varys (maybe by Shae too), "I'm guilty of being a dwarf", "This trial is a farce!", epic dialogue and drama, and more Oberyn (one of the season's MVP so far).
Â 
Wow!
5416	ebevan91	2014-05-09	What is the significance of Trant being in the recap? Same with Pycelle.
Â 
Are they going to give their testimony?

					
					
							Edited by ebevan91, 09 May 2014 - 11:23 AM.
5417	Arkash	2014-05-09	^ I guess they are. I still wonder if there will be more testimonies apart from Shae and Cersei (and that Jaime - Cersei face to face during the trial we have seen on promos).
Â 
The trial looks already pretty heavy with all those stated above plus Cersei declaring the Mountain as her champion, good lines from Tywin and Oberyn, possibly some Bronn in the mix. And the Tyrells somewhere in (possibly a Loras - Margaery scene).

Woah, I didn't realize till now how many persons will sit on chairs(/thrones) the next episode (and staring on and having epic dialogues with other people).
Nearly every picture shows sitting people with cool seats 
Â 
(Every scene includes someone like Tywin, Dany, Tycho (or also Cersei, Oberyn, Mace) sitting around dominantly on chairs which should impress and intimidate someone like Tyrion, the Meereen's folk, Stannis, a.s.o who have to stay or sit on less impressing benchs...

5423	Tormund GiantsMANE	2014-05-09	We could get a similar version. Something along the lines of Asha vhecking the cells for Theon, looks.in his cell, moves on, something something, Theon speaks up, "sister".
However, I will miss the whole Reek Reek it rhymes with Freak thing.


anyone think Theon is too broken to try to escape?Even with his sister and the best killers in the iron islands at her back, Theon may not attempt to escape. How far along in the books was it that Theon mustered up the stones to do something bold? How much "convincing" from Abel and the washers?He fights against his freedom until he has no choice. I don't have him even trying to get away unless the ironmen lay waste to all the bolton forces and show Theon Ramsya's proof of life/death.
5424	Father of Dragons	2014-05-09	What another informative recap that was!
Right, so we'll likely start with Stannis, following the trend of Last-in-Recap, First-in-Episode. From the look on Stannis' face, and his previous attitude, he's probably not too happy about this idea of Braavos. With any luck, other Stannis fans such as myself will get the Stan that disappeared in Blackwater.
In the small council scene, they'll be discussing Daenerys and somebody will probably say something along the lines of "We have bigger matters to discuss." Oberyn may bring up something about Dorne, and Mace will make some sort of speech. The topic of Margaery and Tommen could be confirmed by him.
The Varys/Oberyn scene will happen before the trial, I'm assuming. I hope Varys doesn't give away too much.
Seems like we'll see the statements from Ser Meryn, Pycelle, Varys and potentially Cersei. We'll definitely get the "I'm guilty of being a dwarf!" line. I suppose Shae is a possibility.
At some point, Jaime will confront Tywin and we'll get a bigger argument between the pair that many people were expecting in the first episode.
The long-awaited Dreadfort scene will play out, with so many possible endings and results to it all.
On the other side of the world in Meereen, we'll be seeing Drogon doing his thing, and roasting Hazzea. I think the father might make reference to the crucifixions of the Great Masters, saying "She has brought nothing but death and suffering to Meereen/Slaver's Bay since she arrived!"
Absent will be Arya/Hound, Jon, Bran, Sansa (whom we've seen in every episode up to this point) and Brienne/Pod
EDIT: As stated above, we had no mention of Shae which may be for spoiler reasons but is more likely to be because she won't be appearing.

Â 
Haha, yeah, it definitely should! XDD
Â 
I love this, the chairs are dominant and intimidating and really made for great eyes-/words-exchanges between persons of different power relations, whether it's culprit & judges, banker & borrower (NOT in terms of Beggar King 2.0.!) or queen & supplicant :-)
The "Not big chair sitters" have to stand up to them, but the nice thing is that even a judge (or Hand on the Iron Throne), banker or queen can't do what they want since they're all -actually!- dependent / bound to laws, their business, their jobs, their duties, their images , expectations, a.s.o... The Not Big Chair sitters wants something from the others, but also a bit vice versa.
In the case of Tyrion and the court it's the truth and justice (or let's say, it should actually be this); for Stannis and Tycho a big business deal and for Dany and Hazzea's father it's the dealing with guilt, so the balances of power in these dialogues will be interesting...

5427	oierem	2014-05-09	It seems most of the episode will be devoted to King's Landing and trial. I like it. And I'm dying to see Varys at last! He's been missed this season.
5428	CandleWisps	2014-05-09	Â 
It shouldn't be a surprise, since basically ALL extravagant, colorful and flamboyant elements have been eliminated by the show. Which is understandable. Blue hair, pink cloaks, golden dresses, tower hats etc. work really well in books, where your imagination can process those cartoonish elements, but on screen it would all just look ridiculous.


Â 
Not only would it look ridiculous, but nobody would be able to take the characters seriously. Daario doesn't have his blue hair because they want audiences to identify more with why Dany could be attracted to him, etc etc. Regardless, I would have loved to see Mark Gatiss in that hat, if only to imagine Mycroft in something so ludicrous.
Â 
This does make me wonder about what they plan to with Aegon though. He doesn't dye his hair for the fun of it, it serves a purpose. I mean, they could easily dye his hair black instead, given that the Targ's eye color doesn't mean anything on the show.
Â 
BAMF Oberyn slouching in his chairÂ Â
5429	~No One~	2014-05-09	I realize that the Yara/Balon recap sets the scene for what Yara does this episode, but any chance it might mean that another King bites the dust? 
There are plenty of scenes of Yara they might have chosen... "Don't die so far from the sea" springs to mind. They specifically put a scene of her with Balon in there - his daughter to help provide context, perhaps.
5430	Hath4	2014-05-09	No they choose that seem to remind the audience of the mission she is on.

4x10 will be heartbreaking. 
Â 
By the way, regarding Stannis: I do hope that they'e showing Stannis kinda villanous while showing Daenerys like Jesus Chris-reborn, so that his turning out to be a good king and her turning out to be a bad queen (and maybe even the ultimate villain) will be more impactful. But that's just wishful thinking I suppose.


Yea I keep telling myself that this will be the case and I really hope it will. After doing a pretty horrible job on Stannis up until this point, I feel like I will appreciate a good Stannis portrayal even more so now.Â

I feel like there are subtle hints that he's going to make a turn around, but I refuse to let myself be too optimistic. He looks like he's getting his mojo back next episode.
5436	Konradsmith	2014-05-09	I've liked his portrayal thus far (and even prefer show to book Stan because of Mr. Dillane being awesome), but to those who despair it, there will be a turnaround. They're playing up the potential for him to go to KL and yet he'll do the right thing and head north anyways. That'll win him some subjects. Many of the Unsullied will never like him as much as Dany because he's not a sexy blonde girl, but still I think there'll be an increase in professed StanStans at the end of this season.

I think generally speaking, though I don't always agree, you've made a valid case for the portrayal not being as bad as some of us make it out to be. My big problems really didn't arise until season 3 and 4, cause I think they did a fine job with him during their adaptation of Clash of Kings, despite making him slightly more villanous. If anything, that tells us that even if the showrunners don't care for him, they probably won't tarnish him too much when the source material shows him doing legimately righteous stuff. Admittedly the first half of SoS is his absolute lowest point as a character, and they just made him fall so low that it becomes questionable whether or not the character we want to see can still emerge in light of all the awful things he's done.
5438	Konradsmith	2014-05-09	^Well thank you. People will like Stan, just wait and see. Going north when in show canon he could try and take the capital again is the equivalent of Jaime going back for Brienne in terms of a "pet the dog" moment. It'll work.

It just might. It worked really well for Jaime, even in light of him strangling his cousin. (Though admittedly the whole Sept debacle, which we don't need to get into, has set him back more than a little bit) The one bright star in all this is that they've played up Stannis' love for Shireen. Makes us question why that would be in there at all if he's just going to end up as cookie cutter villain.

5442	CandleWisps	2014-05-09	Speaking of Shireen, does anybody know how many episodes she's in for this season? Kerry Ingram does a fantastic job, and her scenes with Stannis and Davos always brighten up my day. I'd also like to see a one on one scene with her and Selyse, letting people know how her mother treats her (in person, not just through the dinner dialogue she had) would probably win Stannis some more positive favor in the parental region

5444	Konradsmith	2014-05-09	I don't know if she'll appear in episode six, CandleWisps, but I know Kerry Ingram filmed at around the same time that some of the Castle Black stuff was shot (later in the autumn)Â so I think we'll see her in episode ten at least.

God, I always loved this face expression SO much! Stephen's so perfect in showing how Stannis feels uncomfortable with this situation and uneasy with expressing his feelings, that IS so absolute Stannis! His love for Shireen, but great uncertainty how to commune with her, and his struggling feelings about Davos' imprisonment and desperation and frustation after his defeat... and now he meets this family again (admits he cheated on Selyse, answers Shireen he lost the battle, says that Davos "rots" now in a dungeon...) and feels even more discomforting, but you see how the cares for them (especially of course Shireen), and, man, I really love this scene (and this grimace! And Stephen!  ).
5453	CandleWisps	2014-05-09	Thanks, Konradsmith! I assumed that with how much of a time crunch they will be on with all the stories to finish off in episode 10, that we wouldn't be seeing Shireen or Selyse again until season 5. If she was filming around the same time that makes me hopeful.

Hey, why actually do we haven't already a "Stephen Dillane appreciation" thread?!  There's a "Kit Harrington appreciation" thread a.s.o., we need one for Stephen!
5470	iheartseverus	2014-05-09	It should be more subtle, something that only book readers might pick up on, even among the book fandom it's kind of an obscure theory.Â  It may not amount to anything, but I do wonder why now, of all times, they choose to show Tywin eating.


Is it, though?Â  I always thought it was true, never doubted it.Â  Anyone else?
5471	sati	2014-05-09	^I liked you "Braavos here we come" post, Sati. Poor Kit standing next to Sophie and Gwendoline Christie. When he has scenes with Dillane, the new LC won't look very imposing next to the King at the Wall.


I laughed so hard when I saw that picture, Kit's pics usually crack me up, though, he looks so innocent ^^
Â 


I'm way interested in them showing Tywin eating!Â  Actually putting food in his mouth and chewing--have we ever seen that before?Â  Gotta be the 'did the Viper poison Tywin' situation.'Â  I wonder how, and if, they'll play that up?Â  Perhaps Tywin stops chewing, looks down at his plate or pushes it away with some comment--too much salt, or something.Â  Then a cut to Oberyn's face, watching Tywin?Â  Too obvious?


Â 
I'm really hoping they include that theory on the show. When I read the book the first time I never noticed it, but after seeing the post about it here with all the quotes and hints my mind was blown. Oberyn literally gets revenge twice from beyond the grave
5472	iheartseverus	2014-05-09	^ Here's a recap of the 'evidence,' including the terrible condition of Tywin's body after death.Â

Â 
Â

Â 
There is an alternate theory that Varys did the deed, but I always preferred Oberyn one. It's seems very implausible George wrote about Tywin's body stinking and all of that stuff consistent with one of the poisons effects just to make his death more ironic.
5474	CandleWisps	2014-05-09	Yeah, I'd prefer to think it was Oberyn too. Even taking away his life he manages to fulfill a 17 year goal. And I don't think Varys would have done the deed so... prematurely, if he would do it at all by his own hand.
5475	Father of Dragons	2014-05-09	I am not familiar with this theory. I'd heard tiny bits here and there and despite reading the link above, I'm still not so clear on just what it is.

5476	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-09	It still seems to be up for debate how the trial by combat will be revealed, so I thought I'd put in my two cents. I believe in one of the season trailers when Tyrion is in his cell he says "if you want justice you've come to the wrong place." It makes a lot of sense that this would be his response to Oberyn letting Tyrion know he seeks justice for Elia. Maybe after Tyrion responds that way, Oberyn then reveals that he knows a way they can both get justice and then boom drops the trial by combat idea. Maybe it doesn't play out excatly this way by I'm just a huge proponent for Oberyn revealing the trial by combat to Tyrion, as he did in the book, because I found it to be very dramatic and exciting scene for me. I feel like if it is just revealed in court, it may lose some of its impact.Â
5477	Father of Dragons	2014-05-09	Of course, I understand that Oberyn poisoned Tywin. Beyond that, I know nothing.

I never came to the idea myself, but the theory seems plausible and logical. Though it makes Oberyn less of an badass. He tried to kill the Mountain with poison and with his spear and failed with both attempts. He tried to poison Tywin, but Tyrion was quicker. Not that great a murderer after all :/

Wow I always thought that theory was a little out there, but seeing all the evidence makes it very plausible. Assuming its true that only adds to the badassery of Oberyn Martell. RIPÂ
5482	Seneti	2014-05-09	Â 
Because, as a powerful banker, the audience should be able to take him seriously.


Â 
This. I mean... IRL you're not even allowed to have visible tattoos if you work for a bank. If you were to show up one morning styled like book Tycho, you'd be out of a job.
Â 


Â 
It shouldn't be a surprise, since basically ALL extravagant, colorful and flamboyant elements have been eliminated by the show. Which is understandable. Blue hair, pink cloaks, golden dresses, tower hats etc. work really well in books, where your imagination can process those cartoonish elements, but on screen it would all just look ridiculous.


Â 
Agreed. Particularly when it's on a "serious" person such as a banker (the personification of zero sense of humor).
Â 


Recap's here !!!!!
Â 
https://www.youtube....h?v=_5s_LOraW24
Â 
Damn, I wasn't that excited for a recap since the Lost days !
Â 
So, according to the tradition of starting an episode with the last thing of the recap, we might open with Stannis. I would have thought it would be Drogon and Hazzezah.


Â 
Actually, I'm a little underhwelmed by that recap. I was hoping to get some more info, but this didn't confirm/suggest anything that hadn't occurred to me before (aside from Stannis being the first to have a scene, which is definitely weird).
Â 


What we can expect from each arc:
Â 
Ramsay/Theon: shirtless Ramsey epic battle sequence, Yara freeing Theon, Ramsey getting him back, defeating Yara in some way
Â 
Stannis: setting sail for and arriving at Braavos, meeting with Tycho, maybe the Melisandre scene
Â 
Danaerys: first court meeting as ruler, maybe Hazzea, epic Drogon sequence!
Â 
Tyrion: testimonies by Pycelle, Meryn Trant, Varys (maybe by Shae too), "I'm guilty of being a dwarf", "This trial is a farce!", epic dialogue and drama, and more Oberyn (one of the season's MVP so far).
Â 
Wow!


Â 
I'm not sure if they'll show Stannis setting sail. More likely he'll be arriving to Braavos in his first scene.
Â 
I am really looking forward to all the testimonies, though. This episode is going to be Trauma Conga Line for Tyrion.
Â 


Surprise/shock factor I guess.
ETA: and unlike Trant etc. its less necessary to remind us who Shae is


Â 
This. Shae has had more than enough scenes for viewers to remember her face if not her name.
5483	DaveyJoe	2014-05-09	Of course, I understand that Oberyn poisoned Tywin. Beyond that, I know nothing.


Â 
Is that you, Jon?
5484	Father of Dragons	2014-05-09	Is that you, Jon?
Only if something should happen between the Mother of Dragons and Jon in future books.
5485	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-05-09	First picture: is that Olenna on the left? What the hell is she doing there, she told Margaery she'd leave before the trial.


It's just a production still. Doubt we'll get that exact shot in the episode, so I'm not expecting to see Diana Rigg on screen.
5486	Konradsmith	2014-05-09	It isn't her anyway. We've already seen that most KL old lady extras in the court dress similarly to her with the wimple etc.
5487	iheartseverus	2014-05-09	Is this episode rated 'Graphic Violence', does anyone know?Â  Just thinking about the Mountain skewering peasants and of course, whatever pleasantries Ramsay gets up to.
5488	Konradsmith	2014-05-09	^The schedule I'm looking at says "AC (adult content, AL (adult language),Â  N (nudity), SC (sexual content), V (violence)." But this schedule has some wrong info about past episodes so I wouldn't take it as gospel.

I don't know, it is popular, but it has as many detractors as it has supporters, I'd say it's in the same level as Jojenpaste or Hodor being Duncan's great-grandsonÂ

Â 
Â 
It is known.
5500	Arkash	2014-05-09	I realize that the Yara/Balon recap sets the scene for what Yara does this episode, but any chance it might mean that another King bites the dust?
There are plenty of scenes of Yara they might have chosen... "Don't die so far from the sea" springs to mind. They specifically put a scene of her with Balon in there - his daughter to help provide context, perhaps.


Â 
I too actually do wonder if he will, by any chance, see Balon (and then most probhably his death) this episode, after his presence in the Recap. Long shot I know but well, who knows...Â 
Â 
The Varys/Oberyn scene will happen before the trial, I'm assuming.
Â 

Â 
It will be after the Small Council I think. It was Konradsmith IIRC who said the other day that it's a return to the good old characters meeting after a council moment that we havent had since season 1 ! ^^
Â 
Hell, it will be the first small council of the season ! o.O
Â 
Â I'd also like to see a one on one scene with her and Selyse, letting people know how her mother treats her (in person, not just through the dinner dialogue she had) would probably win Stannis some more positive favor in the parental region
Â 

Â 
A Selyse and Shireen scene would be a very good move of the show ! Maybe this episode if Mel, Selyse and Shireen stay at Dragonstone and Mel's bath scene is there. They could transition (I dont know how) from the bathtub scene to a mother and daughter moment.

5511	Hot Kidney Pie	2014-05-10	Strange there wasn't any mention of Shae at all.


That's similar to how it went down in the books..
There was no real mention of her until the trial.
For the shock value I suppose..
I'm on the fence (though we already knew) about them flat out showing Cersei's discovery of Shae.
Whenever she stands trial In the books you reeeeally felt the betrayal from Tyrion's POV.
You then had to question her motives ALL ALONG.
I believe they've done well to (hopefully) establish that same feeling this week.
Though in the show it's all about their 'love for one-another' which is enough.. Don't get me wrong.. It's enough..
I always related Shae to Tysha though..
Tyrion's (failed) attempt of ridding himself of the nasty Tysha business.
Somewhat redemption in his eyes..
In the books I just couldn't really buy that they were truly 'In Love'.
In the show though.. They obviously care for one another..Â 
Or else she would be living large thanks to Varys.
Can't wait to watch this scene play out.

5516	It's Not That Littlefinger	2014-05-10	i dont think its necessary to show nym dragging cat's body from the river. they can just have her show up. it wouldnt matter. plus, its kind of too late anyway. its been weeks or months since the rw in the show.
5517	aFeastForDragons	2014-05-10	Interesting how they are bridging the gap between Mereen and King's Landing. it always annoyed me in the books how there was barely any mention of a surviving Targaryen ruling Mereen with 3 dragons and an army of Unsullied who's brother openly vowed to take back his family throne. You think that would have been the cause for more alarm.
5518	sati	2014-05-10	I seriously wonder how the hell this ep will play out - assuming that the trial is 20 minutes, that leaves 30 minutes for:
Â 
1. Stannis in Braavos
2. Davos and some chicks in Braavos (rumored)
3. Small Council
4. Tywin/Jaime
5. Varys/Oberyn
6. Ramsay - his sex scene or whatever the hell it is with that Myranda chick slapping him across the face, Yara finding Theon, the fight and whatever happens there
7. Drogon going wild
8. Dany scene
Â 
That is shitload of stuff.
5519	Konradsmith	2014-05-10	^To paraphrase Varys: they are no rumours, my lady, the Onion Knight is with women.

With my luck, that'll be tomorrow. So that the ep is even more packed and Stannis ends up with 3 mins of screentime.
Â 
But the nudity in schedule may be referring to Myranda (or Ramsay if he takes anything more off for the fight  ), so who knows

5522	Konradsmith	2014-05-10	I'm sure we'll have plenty of Stannis, Sati. We'll open with him, so that's something. I don't know if they'll just show him setting sail and leave us to assume what wentÂ down since we saw him lastÂ or if they'll show him telling people at Dragonstone that he got a letter from the IBOB. But we'll have enough of him to hold us over I think. If his storyline shows up next episode then I guess some of the funny business, be it Mel nekkid or those courtesans (I think) nekkid, could be held over till then.

I'll bet the ep opens with him on the ship under the Titan.
Â 
I think Mel and Davos' scenes will be in ep. 7 or 8, hopefully both in 7 - I don't mind Stannis not being in those, in fact I'd prefer it - I want Unsullied's brains to explode when the surprise happens and not showing him helps them forget whatever recollection of Mhysa scene they may have.
Â 
I only wish when he is in actual episode he is not rushed and has a decent scene that's not absurdly short.

But I think Davos and the girlies will be in this episode. Sarine Sofair is credited as appearing in it on imdb and the other two women filmed with her. And apparently with Liam Cunningham. Also Sarine Sofair's character is named Lhara which sounds like an Essos name. And onÂ Samantha Bentley's twitter (which I wouldn't recommend checking out, a little too NSFW for my taste) in September she posted a picture she's since deleted of herself in costume and it looked like something they'd wear aboard a pleasure barge.

Â 
Hmm...well, we'll see. I'm so excited to see how it all turns out.
Â 
Another thing in my wishlist is that they kept Oberyn's hilarious behavior and comments during the trial. I wonder if they may actually end with Clegane being named by Cersei, it sounds like such a good ending and Shae moment obviously occurs much earlier than at the end.

Â 
I hope that Oberyn shows his butt before he goes. There is plenty of female nudity and so little male nudity again. Last year at least Nikolaj took one for the team by this point of the season
5533	Konradsmith	2014-05-10	Not that this thread should go too far in this direction, though again its one hundred percent my fault for harping on about these naked actresses, but I think that GoT has an amount-of-nudity-per-season quota rather than a per-episode quota. I've grown to accept it just like we have to stomach product placement in a Bond film. SometimesÂ the scenes areÂ genuinely sexy (Mel and Gendry IMO)Â and sometimesÂ they're all-out tacky (every Theon sex scene ever). But it's one of the realities of the production. HBO's weird that way.

SometimesÂ the scenes areÂ genuinely sexy (Mel and Gendry IMO)Â and sometimesÂ they're all-out tacky (every Theon sex scene ever). But it's one of the realities of the production. HBO's weird that way.


I've never understood why a network that has dramatically expanded storytelling possibilities on TV also feels the need to shove nudity into everything like a 70s B-movie producer.
5535	Konradsmith	2014-05-10	^I think they're beginning to tone themselves down actually. But at the height of True Blood and Hung and early GoT and Boardwalk Empire they really were going overboard.
Â 
That said I will never complain about a Carice van Houten nude scene.

It's actually gotten worse after GoT - True Detective had some massive amounts of boobs in it too, I don't remember this many (as many as nowadays) in Rome or Deadwood. Certainly not in things like Carnivale and Six Feet Under.
Â 
On the other hand they even managed to put a sex scene in John Adams
5537	Konradsmith	2014-05-10	^Rome had a lot more sex than GoT, I'm pretty sure. Which of course was just them being historically accurate. But yeah, the True Detective stuff felt really tacked-on and the writer as good as said he was made to put that in.

Â 
It may feel like there's more in Rome, because it was only 2 seasons and it was a lot of sex scenes....but I recently rewatched it and I think GoT has the lead here. At least in unnecessary female nudity etc - Rome had far less of that.
5539	Konradsmith	2014-05-10	^I love that Rome alums have found their way into GoT. I hope they find a way to fit in Polly Walker (though of course she's doing Mr Selfridge now) and James Purefoy (who's doing the Following). And of course Ray Stevenson.

5542	Hath4	2014-05-10	Yeah but it's not your fault by the time Saturday rolls around we have speculated so much about the upcoming episode that we just run out of things to say.
5543	iheartseverus	2014-05-10	Well, I ask again--anybody got any theories about what Varys can say against Tyrion?Â  ShowVarys, I mean.Â  Sati was kind enough to post BookVarys' testimony, but most of BookVarys' details vs. Tyrion never happened in the show.Â  What could he possibly say that helps to condemn Tyrion?
5544	Konradsmith	2014-05-10	I think he will give info that condemns him, because they've already established that he's testifying against Tyrion rather than for him. I think they showed that clip in the recap of Varys saying that Tyrion saved the city not to set up Varys's sympathy for him but to set up Tyrion "I saved this city" speech.
Â 
I think Peter Dinklage will really sell Tyrion being broken by this experience. In the "weeks ahead" promo which leaked onto youtube we heard him say "I saved you, I saved this city, I should have let Stannis kill you all" and he sounded properly bitter. Though people complain about him being whitewashed, I think we'll see the beginning of his descent into darker territory this Sunday.

Â 
Well unlike the PW - with its snarky comments and sass - and Craster's - with its action - testimony after testimony doesn't sound that exciting, but they can still make it quite intense and thrilling. But that leaked pic makes me think it's one big sequence, starting around 30-35 minute mark.

Just the look on his face when Shae enters - his face shown in multiple promos looking stunned, it's definitely this moment - is heartbreaking
Â 
They really need to make him very depressed and bitter - I was reading that strangling scene today and Tyrion's coldness in doing the deed is shocking

I think Bronn betraying him would make Tyrion's dark side descent more beliavable, I hope it happens
Â 
I kinda wrote this before but with Mel in bath, which I'm pretty sure is at Dragonstone and Carice talking about powder scene I kinda think Selyse goes to get some powders from Mel and they use the scene to farther confuse Unsullied and they'll have them talk about Stannis attacking KL.

I think I'm not seeing Stannis for a month after Sunday  <---me laughing at my own suffering
Â 
If that Davos scene is in tomorrow's ep, I think he won't be there too, seeing how he is with Stannis and they want to keep their destination at the dark. So it's:
Â 
ep. 6- Stannis + Davos, Davos
ep. 7 - Mel/Selyse
ep. 8 - nothing
ep. 9 -
5550	Konradsmith	2014-05-10	Given that that pervy site recapped mentioned a bath-house mayhaps that's where Davos will encounter girls. I don't know if he'd go there to see Salladhor there or maybe to see Tycho Nestoris when the man is off-duty but my guess is that this is when Davos says "As long as Stannis live the war is not over." I always thought that was kindof an odd thing to say while Stannis is around, which we know he is during their official meeting with the IBOB. And maybe you ladies will get to see you some Cunningham.

Vale - introduction of lords more of crazy lysa. Brienne- finding some sort of clue. Jon- return to castle black. Dreadfort- aftermath of attack getting ready to head to moat cailin. Danny and Dario. the hound teaching arya the gift of mercy. That's pretty packed for 52 min.

If we do and Stannis is not there with him so ladies could see some Dillane, I'll be depressed ^^ But any time us girls get some eye candy in the show is appreciated - there are so many chicks excited for that shirtless Ramsay action tomorrow 
Â 
I don't think he'd say that around Stannis too. Unless Stannis just stares Tycho down menacingly and Davos translates 
Â 
My guess here is that the meeting, thanks to Stannis social skills or whatever, doesn't go well and Davos tries again on his own and succeeds.

Â 
Also - Tywin's the man will fight till bitter end and then some line would be wonderful to hear in Small Council scene, but they'll probably just focus on Dany. I think that scene is just there to set up Varys being the one who has the information and eventually revealing the source of it later in the season to the audience
5560	Konradsmith	2014-05-10	I hope that the Small Council scene ties all of the episode's storylines together. It'll beÂ a very focused episode alreadyÂ but it could be even more concentrated if Varys and co. actually brought up Dany, Stannis and the Greyjoy-Bolton conflict in their sit-down. I think the people who think that the show "jumps around too much" between storylines would appreciate that kind of coherence.

Couldn't Varys be the one who betrayed him about Shae? I think he is the one who provided the ship for Shae's exil and we know he's testimoning against Tyrion, so....

Â 
I don't think so. Â Not if Bronn still hopes to train Jaime in upcoming episodes. I don't think that Jaime would let Bronn anywhere near him if Bronn betrays Tyrion.
5570	go joff go	2014-05-10	That's similar to how it went down in the books..
There was no real mention of her until the trial.
For the shock value I suppose..
I'm on the fence (though we already knew) about them flat out showing Cersei's discovery of Shae.
Whenever she stands trial In the books you reeeeally felt the betrayal from Tyrion's POV.
You then had to question her motives ALL ALONG.
I believe they've done well to (hopefully) establish that same feeling this week.
Though in the show it's all about their 'love for one-another' which is enough.. Don't get me wrong.. It's enough..
I always related Shae to Tysha though..
Tyrion's (failed) attempt of ridding himself of the nasty Tysha business.
Somewhat redemption in his eyes..
In the books I just couldn't really buy that they were truly 'In Love'.
In the show though.. They obviously care for one another..Â 
Or else she would be living large thanks to Varys.
Can't wait to watch this scene play out.I kind of think they have let hints that she wasn't loyal from the beginning. The way bronn found her with some ginger #&$& three tents down, the way she was waiting for someone  at blackwater.  I fully expect more explaining about how she ended up with tywin, then we got from the book, and I feel like the clues have been laid
5571	Lord Carson	2014-05-10	I don't think this necessarily means that Bronn betrayed Tyrion. Perhaps Shae was found when Tywin ordered to stop every ship from leaving when Joffrey died. Bronn might be as surprised as everyone else, although I'm sure Tyrion will bring it up if they speak before the fight.
5572	Hath4	2014-05-10	Spoiler alert! We knowâ<U+0080><U+0094>and got a peek in the trailerâ<U+0080><U+0094>that Oberyn will get his fight with The Mountain. 
It was a lot of fight choreography that was stuff I'd never done before. I have mostly stage experience. So I've never done anything as challenging as this. We filmed in Croatia at the Hotel Dubrovnik, which is basically abandonedâ<U+0080><U+0094>it was destroyed during the war. There was this amphitheater right over the water that the crew set beautifully. It was the most insane production team I'll probably ever work with. It was thrilling and scary, grueling and beautiful, and delicious, and fun. David and Dan, in their adaptation, still refuse to completely betray the books, but they keep surprises hidden.
Folks don't last long in the GoT world. If you had to write an obituary for Oberyn what would it say?
Lived it. Loved it. Bye.
Fuck, marry, kill: Cersei, Ramsey, or the Red Priestess? Be specific with your reasoning.
My God. That's hard. To be obvious, I'd have to kill Ramsey because that guy's just wrong. I would never want to cross paths with somebody like that. Fuck the Red Priestess. And then I would marry Cersei because that's Lena Headey, and I love Lena Headey. I'm going to try and marry her, anyway.
(from a rolling stone interview with the red vipers actor found it pretty ammsuing)
5573	Jslay427	2014-05-10	Don't get me wrong, I'm happy for any Stannis screen time but having him need to goto Bravos for gold BEFORE the wall will make his victory against the Wildings diminished. (Obviously he's gonna hire sellswords) What was great about Stannis at the wall was what he did with how outnumbered he was. And if we don't get Stannis!Stannis!Stannis! I will rage hard.

I completely agree I think this is the episode the "whitewashing" ends. It would make sense they would ease into the darker Tyrion this way, so he doesn't go from an angel to killing his father so quickly.Â
5576	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-05-10	Tyrion and Dany both are quite white washed. Hopefully it changes in the latter half of the season.
5577	Queen of Whores	2014-05-10	Tyrion and Dany both are quite white washed. Hopefully it changes in the latter half of the season.

The thing is, I don't really think Dany has been whitewashed, just shown in the wrong way. She is constantly being shown giving these 'epic', 'empowering' speeches, so people think everything she does is badass and awesome, even when it's very questionable. Like, she's burned a rape victim to death, locked two people in a vault to starve to death, ordered the sacking of a city, and crucified over a hundred men. The actions she's made have been quite dark and questionable, just like in the books, but for some reason people see everything she does as badass and empowering, when it's actually dark and disturbing at points. They need to ease up on the speeches and focus on the horrible consequences of her actions (lack of Sack of Meereen, for example).

Â I think that's coming, but as for locking peeps in vaults and crucifying civilians, plenty of Unsullied have commented that she's not being a hero when she does that. It's like how some people read book!Dany's wedding night as sweet and romantic as opposed to "a bit less horrifying than it could have been."
5579	CandleWisps	2014-05-10	Tyrion and Dany both are quite white washed. Hopefully it changes in the latter half of the season.


Â 
Same. The end games of their character arcs (whatever those may be) would be made irrelevant if they didn't go to darker places or make stupid decisions. If we continue to get the Dany the show has been dishing out, it would make her flight and wanderings in the Dothraki Sea completely unnecessary and irrelevant. She needs to make her stupid mistakes and she needs to be slapped in the face with the realization that ruling is not based on idealism. Whitewashed Dany has no development in the foreseeable future. The parallels with her Targaryen bloodline and lineage become eradicated when she doesn't suffer.
Â 
Same goes for Tyrion. His ability to "come back" so to speak with the Battle of Meereen would make no sense. His character development and hers should not have to suffer deprivation on screen because some of the audience wouldn't be able to handle that their favorite characters happen to be darker and more human

And it'll make him look even worse because their relationship is much more loving in show canon.
Â 
As for Dany she's done very nasty things already but I think people still admire her because they see her as a victim who gained agency. And so on.

Tyrion gets mad at Bronn for lying to him, Bronn decides he's done serving Tyrion and decidesÂ not to fight for him because at this point he sees no reason toÂ and there you go. Everything ready for Oberyn to come in and propose his bargain in episode 7.
5590	SM4e	2014-05-11	How I think different issues will work out:
- Stannis gets refused by the Iron Bank
- Davos goes to find Sallador Saan and ask him for men and ships and Salla agrees [Salla is chilling out with Lhara and the other two cast models/porn actresses)
- Season 5: Cersei does not want the Tyrells to receive too much power and therefore tells the Iron Bank to fuck off; Tycho goes to Castle Black and then to Stannis near Winterfell
Â 
- Yara will fail to rescue Theon and go to Moat Cailin where she receives news of Balon's death (which is happening this episode?)
Â 
- we hear Hizdar for the first time, then Hazzea's father
Â 
- I don't really see where The Mountain fits in today; maybe they will actually end the episode with Tyrion demanding trial by combat and Cersei presenting her champion
5591	tyrell19	2014-05-11	I don't know why but I have a sneaky feeling that Tycho will refuse them and point Stannis in the direction of someone who has also come to them for help but at this time they can't due to the Lannisters still paying them. I think this Lord will the Greatjon who wants vengeance for the Red Wedding and will align himself with Stannis for now.
5592	Beric175	2014-05-11	naa, we'll probably get a scene with the Mountain at the beginning of the episode killing peasants, with Cersei watching from the battlements so we get a visual indication of what awaits tyrion if he gets convicted. Then at the end, he demands trial by combat and we're left to ponder who his defender will be until Oberyn announces it at the end of next episode.
5593	Guard of the Rainking	2014-05-11	According to Game of Thrones wiki Stannis appears in episode 7. There is no link, and I haven't heard about it anywhere else. We do know that Tycho appears in only one episode, so I guess that the refusal will be in episode 6. We still haven't seen the Melisandre bath scene or the rumored Davos with ladies scene (BTW where did this rumor come from?) so that's a lot of Stannis stuff in one episode that also includes the attack on the Dreadfort, Tyrion's trial, a lot of KL scenes, Drogon hunting and Dany receiving the "leftovers". Also Braavos is a new location so I think they might want to show it a little more. In short:
Episode 6: Arrival at Braavos and IB refusal.
Episode 7: Stannis makes up his mind on where to sail.

Â 
I dont know where people are getting these theories from, but seems really pointless of including this trip/scene for him to go all that way and get refused. Just because he asks for gold to buy sellswords doesnt mean he is going to get 10 000 men, he will probably only get like 5000 men or so. During an interview with Liam he implied that Stannis has virtually no army and in the scenes so far it has been mentioned that they have virtually nothing.Â 
Â 
Plus in the series Tywin has mentioned that CL has had no gold for this and last year mined, and implying that they are broke and the IT cannot pay the IB. So this could end up the IB giving Stannis a loan. Also they want to make it a surprise at the wall, if he has nothing where else is he going to go?wasted trip to Braavos and sulk on DS?No I dont think so.
Â 
Plus just because he gets a few thousand sellswords does not diminish the victory at CB. They have also implied that the Wildlings have a much greater host of a 100 000 men, I know in the books it included women and children and so forth, but the unsullied dont take that into account, they just hear 100 000 men meaning all are soldiers.

5595	franko99	2014-05-11	The problem is some of you talk to the wrong people. Â There are plenty of 'good fans' that know that Arya's turn to the dark side is troubling and that Dany is not all flowers and ponies. Â they get it.
Â 
Â 
There will ALWAYS BE TONS of viewers for these types of shows that don't get the deeper themes, they just like the action. Â These are the same people who thought Walter White and Tony Soprano were badass good guys. Â The 'bad fans'. Â  These people think Dany nailing people up is awesome and haven't considered that maybe she's got some crazy to her.Â 


While this is true, and there will always be that kind of people (not only in the show viewers, go to the general section and see how many members defend every action Dany does as she could do no wrong), you can't really deny the show has made everything it could to not show the consequences of her actions, it's like they go from badass speech, to badass fight, to badass victory glance, and then badass speech again...

I don't think GoT wiki is a reliable source...I don't think they'll show him making up his mind - the whole point of the way his story is handled this season is to maximize the surprise factor in ep. 9.

I dunno. The Melisandre bath scene is causing me to speculate.

So were still going to have Dragonstone scenes? Are we sure that scenes on Dragonstone and not on a ship?

I think that Stannis at the bank and Davos and the ladies are tonight. I don't think Mel goes with them - she wouldn't be having a bath and chillin' while at Braavos ^^
Â 
Ep. 7 will have Mel and Dragonstone, her in the bath, probably talking to Selyse or something.
Ep. 8 won't have any of Team Dragonstone to set up ep.9 to be more shocking
Â 
That's my guess, anyways

The problem is, did it took 3 episodes to go from Dragonstone to Braavos, but only 2 episodes to go from Dragonstone to the wall? I know the show took some liberties before (cough* littlefinger cough Melisandre cough*) but moving an entire fleet across half Westeros? I don't think soÂ

Well they'll be at their destination in ep. 9 and they're in Braavos in ep. 6. There's nothing they can really do about it now.
Â 
And we don't know when they actually left Dragonstone, since I assume we only see them arrive in Braavos.

Braavos is close to Eastwatch, I have no problem thinking they can go there in between episodes 6 and 9, but Dragonstone is really far away to believe Melisandre can leave after episode 7 and be there for the battle, that's what I'm saying, I don't think we're going to see Dragonstone again (as some users seems to suggest), the bath scene has to be either in Braavos or at a ship

Stumbled on this gem. Hilarious. Didn't know they were such goofs, gonna make tomorrow all the more worth seeing them finally doing something of substance.

5607	Colonel Green	2014-05-11	The problem is, did it took 3 episodes to go from Dragonstone to Braavos, but only 2 episodes to go from Dragonstone to the wall?


Episode 3 had Davos sending a message to Braavos, which they presumably then considered, and then sent a response, at which point Stannis would have debated whether to go or not.Â  So it's not like it was a single journey spanned three episodes.
5608	King Tommen	2014-05-11	Also, since S1 the show has consistently made it clear that if characters are traveling by boat, they can get where they're going as fast or as slow as the plot requires them to. Cat hopped on a boat from the North and was in King's Landing the following episode.
5609	xandi	2014-05-11	^not to mention how fast news seem to be traveling from Slaver's Bay to King's Landing...

Conspicuously faster than it reached the Riverlands.
5611	ToTheWolves	2014-05-11	Tycho Nestoris: Do you feel your blood gives you claim on our gold?
Stannis the Mannis: More than any man living.
GET HYPED. Stannis is back. Hopefully.

Stannis isn't one of my favorite characters I don't hate him though...but when I seen this in the preview I couldn't help but to think "stannis stannis stannis!!" So badass!

still, his ravens or toucans or whatever he sends are extremely fast. I mean it took a whole season for Joffrey to hear rumors of Dany's dragons, now it is only week until Tywin gets news from the Silver Lady

When Dany had her dragons, she was in the middle of the Red Waste. Qarth is further away from Westeros than Slaver's Bay, and less populous, so it's understandable that news from Slaver's Bay arrives faster than news from Qarth. Whether Jorah had his magical toucans or not.

As far as I understand, the only way for news to travel from that far is by ship, a sea voyage which takes a very long time, much longer than a trip from Dragonstone to Braavos or to the Wall.
In AFFC they only mention vague rumors of dragons brought by sailors from the east during a small council meeting well into the book. And Cersei, of course, immediately dismisses these rumors.

okay let's say his toucans flew from qarth to KL, then it may have taken one additional week, if at all.
Or maybe little birds..are quicker than ravens..

The IB will have to come to CB at some point.
Â 
But once more,Â  don't understand throwing in a lengthy sea voyage for Stannis when there isn't time toÂ make one in the storyline???Â  Gosh the show has my head spinning.Â  Can't seem to make conclusions based on logic, not nearly like you can with the books.Â  
Â 
Still can't wait for theÂ next episodeÂ though.

Â 
My memories are a bit hazy... But how much talk was there actually in Westeros about Dany (after AGOT)?
I can remember this Small Council meeting with Cersei and the vague rumours you're talking about, and there's this chapter with Davos in a tavern in White Habor where he also hears some rumours and gossip by a Braavosi oarsman about her... But what else?

Through the power of not introducing that story point, one imagines.
5623	LordCouture	2014-05-11	They have cast Mark Gatiss to play Tycho. To me that's a clear sign we'll see his character next season in both KL and CB. If Tycho was only in one scene where he gives a loan to Stannis, then they would have cast a nobody from the street instead.

yes, Hollywood magic, mmm.... so fillingÂ
5625	Arkash	2014-05-11	^^ And Mark Gatiss seems very enthusiast at the idea of returning for a guest-role to allow him time for his other projects. I'm quite sure we will get something like three (maybe four) scenes with him next season.
5626	iheartseverus	2014-05-11	^ I saw an interview with him after he was first cast, he laughed and said he didn't know where his character was going, but since this is GoT, he assumes he's going to die some horrible, violent death.Â  Plus, I saw a newer interview, and wow, he gives nothing away--I mean, nothing!Â  Wouldn't even tell the reporter what part he's playing!Â  Said he enjoyed it, it was all great fun, and that's that.Â  Perfectly British-ly courteous and smiling and... nothing, wouldn't say a word.Â  Can't wait!!Â  15 minutes, yay!
