"dark  sister",2012-04-22,"joffrey scene seems pointless to me isnt everyone clear on what an ass he is at this pointi dont think its pointless they didnt really care out the sansa beating scene the way they did in the book so its natural that he wanted to take his anger out on someone else fully the way he did with sansa also it shows how his cruelty is escalating how hes going from snotty to mean to cruel to mutilator and to murderer like i said before a real ted bundy type people who have read about him might esp agree with mei dont like the way the shadow baby made that horrible screech it was supposed to be stannis in shadow form yknow why would it screech and it was soooo hard to see it i also think that she should have talked about how they needed to row her there because of the magic locked into the stones of storms end that wouldve been a good explanation i like that they kept the rotten onion part but if i had to cut one line it would be the latter bc the former explains why davos had to smuggle her beneath the walls"

"dark  sister",2012-04-22,"this is my favorite episode so far mostly because im really into the idea of sticking to the book i thought that it was okay that they compressed nans cupbearing for roose into cupbearing for tywin altho itll be interesting to see how she handles her angerbutterfly effect majorly i also thought it was cute when tywin called her clever for dressing and cutting her hair like a boy"

"ckal",2012-04-22,"i understand it is very hard to adapt this season more so than the first season because of all the different story lines but im just not getting the same feeling from this season so far i think once renly dies next episode it will streamline some story telling but the last 6 eps better really ramp things up im getting a slow meandering plot line feeling from it right now unfortunately acok was he same way until about half way through iirc i really hope hbo cuts down on these extra pointless scenes that are imo dragging down the eps that werent in the book"
"Doza",2012-04-22,"i dont have much of an issue with the violence the books contains significantly more violent scenes since the episodes are so short hbo has to make the scenes stick if you arent a book reader then you wouldnt remember when the tickler shows up again that is unless hes remembered"

"Laohu",2012-04-22,"that daenerys scene at the gates of qarth i thought it showcased how bold and unrelenting dany was trying to be with her hosts she already showed up with what a 2025 person khalasar and she needed to prove that she was not as weak as she appeared to the elders that scene was all about her posturing her gamble paid off but even i admit i was wondering how it was going to play out until xaro bailed her out with this sumai agreement"

"dark  sister",2012-04-22,"you want to stick to the book and this is your favorite episode so far that is some serious cognitive dissonanceserious cognitive dissonance why do you have to verbally nastyi felt that there were more scenes in this episode that actually stuck to the story sometimes scenes taken verbatim ex lancel and tyrions little midnight talk i thought that the idea of qarth being a closed city was kind of strange and in the book i believe at least jorah knew about qarth but it is a merchant city they were eager to see her dragons im not sure why they created conflict like that also its going to be more than passing strange if we see just that one shot of drogon on danys shoulder for the rest of the season aside from that things were much more true to the book than previous episodes also a lot less adding in scenes which werent in the books i think the only one here was lf being in renlys camplast week the different plots really felt like they connected better thematically i thought it was rather disjointed this week and some of the scenes that were added ugh is the surgeon we met tonight really going to be what takes the place of jeyne westerling thats gonna be a hot messhow do you think they were connected better thematically it seems to me that one moment were in kl the next were with the nw the next were with dany then aryawith not much segue if any in between ive noticed the episodes being like this pretty much from the start although ive only watched each of them twice so i could be wrong but that was the distinct impression i gotalso i couldnt hear what name the surgeon girl offered up i have no clue why they would want to make her be from volantis when it makes much more sense esp for robbs fate for her to be a westerling of the crag it was obvious robb was interested in her andor respected her but i couldnt recognize her as the actress playing jeyne maybe she was just lying about volantis so he wouldnt know shes a lannister bannerwoman or whateverotoh i thought joffrey with the whores was a disturbingly well done scene a friend felt it was unnecessary because joffreys nature has already been shown but i think its one thing to suspect how much of a creep he is based on his boisterous actions in front of a crowd its another thing to see that hes 16 and hed rather get one whore to beat up another than get a bj i mean damni thought that was an important scene as well i think that whore was using a mace as well its clear to the audience now that he is a sadistic mutilator of women and that his pentup frustration with not being able to hurt sansa was unfortunately taken out on these unsuspecting prostitutes i wonder what the fallout with tyrion will be when he finds out"

"PhoenixFlame",2012-04-22,"was stannis the grammar nazi in the books its great touch fewer xd lancel got pwned thanks to some other boarder who once referred to him as little red riding lancel that name is stuck in my head okthe thing about the new mountain that bugs me is his voice he sounds way too polished in the books the dude comes across as barely capable of holding a conversation grr argh sword that said its a hard role to fill physically i liked the shadowbaby scene more here than in the books in the books i just pictured this little shadow dude running off loved the whole crawling screeching thing mels belly contorting as she birthed itblech stillsickgif classbbcemoticon altstillsick "

"MSUMC25",2012-04-22,"i love what they are doing with lf they are really foreshadowing on why he begins to plot against the lannisters with cersei threatening him tyrions deception and that scene with cat when he realizes she hates him now they are setting it up perfectly as the red wedding being the final straw for him deciding to save sansa i thought for sure they were going to end it with renly dead but that was a killer cliff hanger people are going to be shocked next week if they havent read the books the shadow baby is really the first time sorcery appears in the books so its really going to throw everyone for a loop i wonder if they are going to show the battle between edmure and tywin lannister at riverrun or if its going to be edited out"

"AnikaUnderfoot",2012-04-22,"ya thats what i see happening as wellif they did do it that way just starting off the episode with renly being dead i wonder how the nonbook audience would take it on one hand stannis made it pretty clear that he was in it to win the war and he obviously sent davos and mel to go do something for the war effort but im just curious how the nonbook readers would make their connections between the shadow baby renlys death and then being segued into brienne being blamed for it"

"Ravenhair",2012-04-22,"and to all the people who say just get over the fact that the tv show is not the books verbatim i get it i get that the tv shown is just based on the books however as you are entitled to your opinion i am also entitled to mine and that is this much character and plot divergence is a disservice to a really good story and frankly a disservice to the amazing season agot had last year"

"MSUMC25",2012-04-22,"squire they have to editchange certain things to meet the budget and squeeze 1200 pages into a 10 hour episode they dont need to show two shadow babies if you hadnt read the books you would just assume with renly dead storms end would yield to the last remaining baratheon alive in stannis qarth looked amazing so im not sure what the big deal is there plus in my opinion i like that things dont follow verbatim it keeps it interesting i think the writers have done a great job of adding some to the story ie jamie and ned actually fighting in the first season"
"Trebla",2012-04-22,"well the thing about lf is that cat is his biggest weakness it always had been and remained so for the rest of her life his making a move on cat is similar to his kissing sansa in the snow varys had it right when he lamented in the book on how clever men can be fools for love"
"Ser Joe of House Targaryen",2012-04-22,"overall i really enjoyed this episode thought the tyrion scenes were just tops same with aryas scenes the only parts i didnt care for were danys scene and joffreys whore scene shame that after not seeing dany that this crappy scene is what they do with her and joffs part just seemed so pointless while reading the books he always seemed like a typical spoiled rich kid who got bored and did stupid things not a so much a monster like the show is portraying him"

"teemo",2012-04-22,"this i have to disagree with i think it was made abundantly clear in the book that the tickler is one of the most ordinary men arya has ever met even after having seen him torture people she would remark that she would look at him and forget he was a lannister man here are the passagesmaybe i miswrote i know how the tickler looks i actually have those same passages marked and read them before the tv airing i was glad that he looked very nondescript like the book stated but i remember how much his questions instilled fear into arya that was part of what was so scary about him a ordinary looking man but extremely scary and chilling when he did his tickling in asos in the inn shivers went down her spine when she heard the tickler ask a question i just expected to be a little more scared by him"

"Rockroi",2012-04-22,"so there are many episodes in the series â<U+0080><U+009C>game of thronesâ<U+0080><U+009D> and this â<U+0080> was one of them good but not great letâ<U+0080><U+0099>s start off with some things nice to saythis is what i likedstannis baratheon first of his name king of the andals and the roynar and the first men  i said last episode that the thing i liked about maergery tyrell was that she was â<U+0080><U+009D>in it to win itâ<U+0080><U+009D> she wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t about loving renly or bringing peace to the realm or any in a long line of bullshit reasons people say they do things no she wanted to be queen and this episode we are watching stannis baratheon find his stride heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s king of westeroes and everyone else is something else either they are rebels doing rebel things robb or upjumped lords renly who donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know their place or shitty lords out on an island greyjoy or monstrous abominations joff but stannis is a king going after what is his and they are turning stannis into this relentless force this coolheaded man of few words and harsh actions who knows whatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s his knows how to get it and knows what it will take to get itin other words for the first time since we met him stannis baratheon of the series is acting like stannis baratheon of the books and its workinghonorable mention fewer laughed out loud at thatthe shadow hand another episode another peter dinklidge virtuoso performance this time it was that darker side that cold hearted and piercing stare he gave lancel heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s said it a few times now he wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t end up like ned stark and this episode he didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t say it but for the first time we saw that tyrion lannister is definitely not the same man ned stark was in some ways heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s just as decent saving sansa like that but in other ways heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s brutal and cold such as in leaving lancel to dangle and when all was said and done he made it clear see this face others wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t see it againand other times charisma humor deft moves everything in this show comes together in tyrion its a great characterwell written and expertly acted tyrion is the best part of this show but that was predictablethe lord of the west harrenhal westeros iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll take 5 minutes of tywin lannister okay 3 fine but in just a few minutes we got more from tywin than we did in the what seemed like 25 minutes we were standing outside of qarth we discovered something tywin rules tywin doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t order he doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t torture he doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t humiliate he doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t grovel he rules tywin lannister sees with his eyes hears with his ears a man seesand a man knowsjoffery the mad i kinda feel like they put this scene here just to fuck with certain people â<U+0080><U+009C>oh you thought watching renly and loras kiss last week was rough oh you want to see rough sex scenes well motherfucker weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll show you rough sex scenesâ<U+0080><U+009D> and then horror ensues people i was watching the show with were openly gasping it was a well done and brutal scene in order for us to get to a place where joffâ<U+0080><U+0099>s horribleness is beyond question we need to see him be a monster and this was monstrous power corrupts and being fucking nuts corrupts absolutelyrobb stark before the battle the shot of robb on his horse as the lannister soldiers are talking was phenomenal you get the sense that robb knows what he is doing and is not awed by himself or the task before himwhat i am on the fence aboutcatlyn stark no more useful than in the books i liked that catlynâ<U+0080><U+0099>s character got a lot said to her this episode she was chided by stannis she got to hear lfâ<U+0080><U+0099>s deal offered she got back nedâ<U+0080><U+0099>s bones but i felt the whole time that she was reacting to what was going on and never acting now i thought her time on the screen was valuable she took in and tied together a lot of plot but i thought the story would have moved better had it been relieved of catâ<U+0080><U+0099>s presence in the book cat has to be there she has to witness the deed but in the show sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s hardly essential and then you add in petyr and it just feels so forced i will say that i liked that petyr made it clear that tyrion was making this offer to her not to robb and her reaction was â<U+0080> pretty good but overall i think cat in the series is showing us just how slow cat from the books washonorable mention oh and how is she going to escape camp while carrying nedâ<U+0080><U+0099>s bonesrobb stark after the battle so a lame philosophical discussion with a cute woman after the battle discussing why you attached these men really did the writer fall asleep while watching an episode of mash the dialog was outdated even then seriously it wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t a bad scene just lazy and uninspired youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re better than thatwhat i dislikedor she could just show them the dragonsthis may seem like itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a minor issue but itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a little bigger than many would think so dany goes to qarth and is greeted by like 19 people 13 of which run the city i would have thought that if 13 people run the city they could afford more than 15 guards each but whatever okay so they get there and this guy who is not illyrio but who seems like illyrio greats her and her starving troupe and she starts complainingor she could just show them the dragons the 13 then ask openly â<U+0080><U+0093>to see the dragons and dany makes this hamhanded attempt to bypass thisor she could just show them the dragons they ask again this time pretty forcefully dany begins complaining nay threatening qarth â<U+0080> in what sound slike dialog that we will hear again soon with cersei burn cow bow kneel cinders blah blah blahor she could just show them the dragonsthere is more talking the fat guy who is not illyrio waddles back and forth and says how she cannot come in jorah warns dany about how she shall handle this things grow quiet she is desperate now they may not get into the city after all will they be forced to starve out hereor she could just show them the dragonsthe summer idles guy comes out and he starts talking about stuff we donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t care about at all and he pulls out a knife and slashes his hand and makes this bold decoration yes he will let them in but it could cost him his own heador she could just show them the dragonsseriously what was that 18 minutes okay it wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t but it sure as hell felt like it what did we accomplish we got to see cgis

"Tewks44",2012-04-22,"so there are many episodes in the series â<U+0080><U+009C>game of thronesâ<U+0080><U+009D> and this â<U+0080> was one of them good but not great letâ<U+0080><U+0099>s start off with some things nice to saythis is what i likedstannis baratheon first of his name king of the andals and the roynar and the first men  i said last episode that the thing i liked about maergery tyrell was that she was â<U+0080><U+009D>in it to win itâ<U+0080><U+009D> she wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t about loving renly or bringing peace to the realm or any in a long line of bullshit reasons people say they do things no she wanted to be queen and this episode we are watching stannis baratheon find his stride heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s king of westeroes and everyone else is something else either they are rebels doing rebel things robb or upjumped lords renly who donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know their place or shitty lords out on an island greyjoy or monstrous abominations joff but stannis is a king going after what is his and they are turning stannis into this relentless force this coolheaded man of few words and harsh actions who knows whatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s his knows how to get it and knows what it will take to get itin other words for the first time since we met him stannis baratheon of the series is acting like stannis baratheon of the books and its workinghonorable mention fewer laughed out loud at thatthe shadow hand another episode another peter dinklidge virtuoso performance this time it was that darker side that cold hearted and piercing stare he gave lancel heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s said it a few times now he wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t end up like ned stark and this episode he didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t say it but for the first time we saw that tyrion lannister is definitely not the same man ned stark was in some ways heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s just as decent saving sansa like that but in other ways heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s brutal and cold such as in leaving lancel to dangle and when all was said and done he made it clear see this face others wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t see it againand other times charisma humor deft moves everything in this show comes together in tyrion its a great characterwell written and expertly acted tyrion is the best part of this show but that was predictablethe lord of the west harrenhal westeros iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll take 5 minutes of tywin lannister okay 3 fine but in just a few minutes we got more from tywin than we did in the what seemed like 25 minutes we were standing outside of qarth we discovered something tywin rules tywin doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t order he doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t torture he doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t humiliate he doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t grovel he rules tywin lannister sees with his eyes hears with his ears a man seesand a man knowsjoffery the mad i kinda feel like they put this scene here just to fuck with certain people â<U+0080><U+009C>oh you thought watching renly and loras kiss last week was rough oh you want to see rough sex scenes well motherfucker weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll show you rough sex scenesâ<U+0080><U+009D> and then horror ensues people i was watching the show with were openly gasping it was a well done and brutal scene in order for us to get to a place where joffâ<U+0080><U+0099>s horribleness is beyond question we need to see him be a monster and this was monstrous power corrupts and being fucking nuts corrupts absolutelyrobb stark before the battle the shot of robb on his horse as the lannister soldiers are talking was phenomenal you get the sense that robb knows what he is doing and is not awed by himself or the task before himwhat i am on the fence aboutcatlyn stark no more useful than in the books i liked that catlynâ<U+0080><U+0099>s character got a lot said to her this episode she was chided by stannis she got to hear lfâ<U+0080><U+0099>s deal offered she got back nedâ<U+0080><U+0099>s bones but i felt the whole time that she was reacting to what was going on and never acting now i thought her time on the screen was valuable she took in and tied together a lot of plot but i thought the story would have moved better had it been relieved of catâ<U+0080><U+0099>s presence in the book cat has to be there she has to witness the deed but in the show sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s hardly essential and then you add in petyr and it just feels so forced i will say that i liked that petyr made it clear that tyrion was making this offer to her not to robb and her reaction was â<U+0080> pretty good but overall i think cat in the series is showing us just how slow cat from the books washonorable mention oh and how is she going to escape camp while carrying nedâ<U+0080><U+0099>s bonesrobb stark after the battle so a lame philosophical discussion with a cute woman after the battle discussing why you attached these men really did the writer fall asleep while watching an episode of mash the dialog was outdated even then seriously it wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t a bad scene just lazy and uninspired youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re better than thatwhat i dislikedor she could just show them the dragonsthis may seem like itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a minor issue but itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a little bigger than many would think so dany goes to qarth and is greeted by like 19 people 13 of which run the city i would have thought that if 13 people run the city they could afford more than 15 guards each but whatever okay so they get there and this guy who is not illyrio but who seems like illyrio greats her and her starving troupe and she starts complainingor she could just show them the dragons the 13 then ask openly â<U+0080><U+0093>to see the dragons and dany makes this hamhanded attempt to bypass thisor she could just show them the dragons they ask again this time pretty forcefully dany begins complaining nay threatening qarth â<U+0080> in what sound slike dialog that we will hear again soon with cersei burn cow bow kneel cinders blah blah blahor she could just show them the dragonsthere is more talking the fat guy who is not illyrio waddles back and forth and says how she cannot come in jorah warns dany about how she shall handle this things grow quiet she is desperate now they may not get into the city after all will they be forced to starve out hereor she could just show them the dragonsthe summer idles guy comes out and he starts talking about stuff we donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t care about at all and he pulls out a knife and slashes his hand and makes this bold decoration yes he will let them in but it could cost him his own heador she could just show them the dragonsseriously what was that 18 minutes okay it wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t but it sure as hell felt like it what did we accomplish we got to see cgis

always dovery well written analysis i disagree with a key point and i also gotta agree on a key point i actually loved the scene were dany was met by the qartheen sure it wasnt from the books and like you said or she could just show them the dragons but i think it was acted out nicely and i really liked how the qartheen were portrayed an isolated merchant city with an eccentric culture and an eccentric people however your comments on the stannis and renly meeting really hit home for me i liked the dialogue of the scene for the most part but i kept thinking something doesnt feel right and i feel like you hit the nail on the head what was stannis doing i feel like episode 3 could have ended with a cliffhanger and you know hbo loves their cliffhangersrandom soldier king renly your audience is requestedrenly in his standard charming tone i would be happy to honor that request who seeks my audiencerandom soldier  its stannisbam cliffhanger right there instead were thrown into a scene with renly and stannis and since i read the books i didnt really notice how random that scene was right away but i can only imagine how confusing that must have been for someone who hasnt read the books"

evillooking twirling their mustaches thats the whole point of the ticklerahem rant over3 ros is a character on the show get the fuck over it her role is not a waste of space she is providing a great narrative and she is smoking hot she is also nailing her role the look of fear on her face as joffrey forces her to beat her fellow worker was some of the best acting on tonights episode and as i already mentioned this is remarkable because of how well acted this series isros serves no purpose but hamfisted redundancy and no i will not get over itwhat balefont said i like the show and i dont mind most of the changes but no i will not get the fuck over it she is a waste of screen time that scene was useless we already know joffreys a sadistic prick ros is the creators pet and a scrappy periodnote i have nothing against the actress herself her acting is fine she looks good etc im blaming entirely dd for their stupid insertion of their pet fanfiction into the story1 tyrion thought about getting joffrey a whore but never acted upon it the scene with joffrey and the whores was unnecessary we know hes awful and right now hes more awful than cersei and theon combined 2 i liked the setting up of the tyrionsansasandor thing though when sandor gave her his cloak i just screamed not now damn it not now3 arya as tywins cupbearer what in the hell are the writersdirectorsproducers doing 4 harrenhal looked exactly as i imagined it husband said the same thing5 really liked tyrions exchange with lancel peter dinklage is great as always and eugene simon did an outstanding job as lancel 6 the torture scenes at harrenhalgood but i wanted to hear the words of the interrogation all of them did they really need to edit the whole is there gold in the village questioning 7 davos is rowing melisandre over to give birth to a shadow baby to kill renly why why why he despised doing it to kill ser cortnay penrose and it made us love him for hating melisandre and for hating doing this duty for stannis davos involved in renlys death writers etc why8 hated renly saying he loved his brother stannisq once renly never loved stannis and would never say this and stannis offer to make him heir so out of character given his feelings for renly that it is laughable9 margaery and baelish have a conversation about at renlys camp about the status of her marriage natalie dormer did well but again writersproducers why10 baelish brings cat neds bones now the episode is bordering on being ludicrous 11 i assume we met jeyne westerling tonight if so i like the tv version much better than the book version except for the fact that this jeyne westerling reminds me nothing of the jeyne westerling of the books but hey im sure the writersdirectorsproducers will figure out some bizarre way to deal with sybell spicer giving her daughter moon tea next season 12 qarthwas another wtf13 caprice van houten did a great job in the birthing of the shadow baby scene first time i liked her 14 best things about this episodeharrenhall and the shadow babyi like show but i am also very critical of it that said i find most not all of your complains to be unreasonable sorry1 i agree that was completely unnecessary no argument there mostly it was too long i dont mind if they showed something that tyrion thought of doing but never did per se but the scene dragged on for way too long for very little gain kind of like sansa and shae last episode what is it with prostitutes always being in the most annoying scenes 2 seriously you wanna bitch about that come on3 compressing duh arya spends a lot of time at harrenhal in acok and they cant show everything of it i am a bit apprehensive about this myself but ill be glad so long as we get to see the weasel soup later6 see 27 again compressing there is no way theyre going to cast cortnay penrose if they havent cast the reeds or the blackfish so they merged the two assassinations into one a smart change considering the time and budget constraint lets be reasonable folks8 already refuted9 agreed seemed like a bit of a waste my guess is that it serves to foreshadow littlefingers plotting with the tyrells later on but it was still kinda awkward most littlefinger scenes seem to be 10 eh see 2 why is that such a big deal not sure what will happen to those bones once catelyn escapes renlys camp though11 i like that jeyne is strongwilled and smartmouthed rather than the meek insipid girl we knew from the book but i dont like the whole pretending to be a foreign commoner part at all if robb sleeps with her then learns shes highborn and is forced to marry her after deflowering her it removes responsibility from robbs mistakes i hope thats not what will happen12 did you expect to see vaes tolorro im sure it got cut for budget reasons instead we had this confrontation which worked out fine i just thought it was dumb that dany couldnt show the dragons at all budget okay but come on its just silly"

"Elimeny",2012-04-23,"in regards to the comments about people complaining about how the show does not match up with the book and how they should essentially stfu let me say this i usually tell my friends that it is better to see the movie on which a book is based before reading the book the book is always better than the movie imagination has no budget the movie doesnt ruin the book its rather the other way around i have no problem with them combining various scenes and characters where needed in order to make the show work i also dont particularly mind them adding scenes in order to give more background to characters i sometimes wonder if martin is particularly complicit in them thinking that perhaps the reaction to some of his characters was not as he had expected and therefore wants them to add scenes to give a different take on a character ie cersei season 1 however what concerns me are butterfly effects let us take for example the shadowbaby birthing scene i dont mind necessarily that they are combining the deaths of renley and the steward  cant remember the name of storms end  except was it made clear that they were at storms end because if so i missed that and thats important because melisandre had to be smuggled into the gates of storms end due to old protective enchantments on storms end similar to those at the wall both perhaps built by bran the builder and i think this may become important later on down the line in the series in the episode melisandre didnt even explain about the enchantments and that concerns me in the previous episode they cut out shireen entirely and i think she will also become more important later in the series due to her greyscale the fact that they appear to be making arya the cupbearer for tywin would be okay except that im wondering how they are going to handle the three deaths she is granted if she doesnt serve under weese if theres no weasel soup again im just thinking about the butterfly effects i am particularly concerned about next weeks episode due to the preview in the preview jaken hquar states that he is a servant of rhilor either they are changing the story line or they are actually telling us something that hasnt been disclosed in the book series yet or hes just outright lying"

"Currawong",2012-04-23,"in regards to the comments about people complaining about how the show does not match up with the book and how they should essentially stfu let me say thisi usually tell my friends that it is better to see the movie on which a book is based before reading the book the book is always better than the movie imagination has no budget the movie doesnt ruin the book its rather the other way aroundi have no problem with them combining various scenes and characters where needed in order to make the show work i also dont particularly mind them adding scenes in order to give more background to characters i sometimes wonder if martin is particularly complicit in them thinking that perhaps the reaction to some of his characters was not as he had expected and therefore wants them to add scenes to give a different take on a character ie cersei season 1however what concerns me are butterfly effectspeople need to remember that they are watching an adaptation of the books not an exact filming of the story and that means there will be changes if you dont get this by now perhaps go and review various cast interviews seeing that so many people like charles dance perhaps they could start with his interviews including the importance of the scripts standing alone and the reasons why he hasnt read the books and for those who seem to nitpick about even the tiniest little thing or dislike far more than they like about the show all i can say is  your tv does have an off switch you know if you dont want to be peeved annoyed or disappointed each week then dont watch the show at all simple and much better for your blood pressure biggrinpng classbbcemoticon altd one other thing  many viewers wont have read the books at all so they wont be aware of all the details that some book fans complain have been omitted or condensed the key thing for hbo is that the series works for general tv viewers who are new to grrms world and for that reasond they will add scenes and characters omit or alter others and possibly alter the order of some events it has to tell a good story and because the books are so complex there are going to be changes i agree about the possible butterfly effects but d  d are working to a long term plan for the series so i have to have faith that they will have taken these things into account even though they may not have written details scripts for upcoming seasons you assume they have at least worked out the basic storylines so that these matters have been addressed edited by currawong 23 april 2012  0118 am"

"dark  sister",2012-04-23,"i totally agree with the butterfly effect problem too and grrm himself mentioned that it could be a problem and his example for this was when drogo slew mago that is such a small small incident compared to other things they have changed or added the biggest example that comes to mind is when lf acts totally out of character and taunts cersei about her twincest and she threatens to slit his throat the best player of the game would firstly never do something like that and secondly never let her get away with it we dont know if cersei is going to eventually die although a lot of ppl hope she will but damn with lfs skill i cant see her living past season 3 after that insult which would create a problem once they get to feast bc so much of that book is from her pov or at least whenever ive read it its always seemed that way to me sometimes i call it the cersei book out of all the asoiaf books ned was game tyrion was clash aryajon was 3 cersei was 4 dany was 5 edit about lfs taunting and cerseis reaction in the book lf mentions to sansa that if cersei were to find her hed have to remove her cersei from the game before he had planned this shows just how confident and likely capable he is of removing the queen regent and hey i dont doubt it or even if he overestimates himself and cant that confidence and slyness is part of his character so my problem with that particular scene is this either the producerswriters are changing lfs character to one who would make a dumb move be threatenedhumiliated and then not retaliate or to one who would taunt her be threatened then kill her in retribution either way they are severely changing his character  all in one added scene cerseis reaction to his savage wit was totally in character for her but its so out of character for him that i believe it might confuse the viewer who hasnt read the books in the first season he is infinitely cunning and seems never to make a mistake at court here he is making a fool out of himself i wish i could ask the writers what they were trying to set upaccomplish with that confrontation edited by dark sister 23 april 2012  0223 am"

"Mauvka",2012-04-23,"in defense of the joffreywhores scenei think it does quite a bit more than just show the progression of his depravity this scene solidifies why once the lannistertyrell alliance is made joffrey must die think about what weve seen of joffrey up to this point from the perspective of a powerful family like the tyrellshe beats up on sansawell theres bad blood between them war and all that and shes far more a prisoner of war than a queen there is no reason to presume from this that the way he treats sansa will be the way he treats margaeryhe has commonersdrunk knights torturedagain the tyrells would think they are above such risk they are a powerful house not like the rabblehe had roberts bastards killedan ugly order but some may call it justifiedwhile many of these actions can be a bad pr issue for the crowntyrell alliance none are a serious threat what joffrey does with the whores is as someone above noted a teenage boy is presented with two naked young ladies in a room and his reaction is to have them beat each other the mental depravity of that scene goes far beyond anything weve seen before margaery can never be safe married to this joffrey that is why the tyrells will take on the huge huge risk of assassinating the king not just the king but a lannister king im sure the tyrells have heard the rains of castamere and they need a better reason to take that risk than joffrey has a mean streak that is why we will have the purple wedding"

"Aegnor",2012-04-23,"so i knew they were going to combine the two shadow babies into one and i figured they definitely wouldnt do away with the scene of davos smuggling melisandre but i figured that meant wed see storms end as that was the only thing left that would make sense renly would be at storms end and the shadow baby to kill renly would be born there but they took a different tact which im not sure makes any sense if you actually think about it also i was totally expecting it to go straight from that scene to brienne putting renlys armor on and then ending the episode with renlys death im surprised that didnt happen"

"The Second Hand",2012-04-23,"wow this episode was awfulthey took one of the best passages george has ever written  the landing at storms end which of course is completely absent  and mutilated it with a tragic cut to that barely empthasizes a massive part of the novel  how much it costs for a king to truly win a throne sadly the speech between renly and stannis was absolutely flat in the novel it frickin popped  back and forth renly the conniving brother who just wants some respect and the honorable stannis believing in right over victorand then there was the torturing scene really do we not already know how awful joffrey is its just god so useless to the overall story oh and what about this new love interest for robb how is that even close to importantill take a breath i did like the handling of harrenhal but yeah im so negative"
"Lady Octarina",2012-04-23,"best episode so far anyone though by far the most cruel first of all i must say i absolutely loved what they did to harrenhall  not as great as i imagined perhaps but certainly much more realistic aryas arc promises to be the best tyrion was as great as usual that scene with lancel was simply lol renly and stannis meeting was good enough though a bit rushed is it just me or stannis scenes always seem too rushed and the shadow baby scene was much more creepy than i could ever have thought the only thing i didnt like was baelish i dont know the character seems to have lost something since the first season"

"Stark@heart",2012-04-23,"me too i was strangely relived to see it just be used for beating i think that would be too fareven for hboexactly how i felt but i get why they used that scene to highlight just how sick and twisted joffery really is they have to show that joff is much more of a threat to sansa than cersei to help set upexplain her escape after joff gets his just deserts"

"dragon_fire",2012-04-23,"i completely agree with people saying that the episodes run too short i timed it at 50 mins tooi end up thinking oh no its over and wanting more after each one maybe thats what they were going for   the hbo could have made them longer bc there is so much material to be covered but i guess its their visioni feel that the hbo joffrey is about 16  older than book joffrey 13 yo so it wouldnt make much sense if 16 yo would crossbowing cats around the castlethe joffrey scene with whores shows us a different joffrey  he feels sting after being educatedreprimanded by his uncle in front of all the people while he was sitting on the iron throne no less so he sends a message to tyrion to warn him not to mess up with him for he can play the game after he confirms by asking roz that my uncle picked you himself i wish they would show tyrions reaction later oni felt a bit concerned about missing dondarion and then hearing tickler asking the tortured about brotherhood without borders but i read the books i get the feeling that dondarion and his red priest wont be making an appearance due to budget considerations then it leaves the question of reanimating catelyn so i think they wont be killing her to make it easier on a viewer and not the reader in general we are getting much more sex albeit its not the sexy kind of sex than magic in this interpretation of the books and its producers right to their vision also its probably cheaper to make  i dont get an idea of stannis having sex with melissandre from reading the book the whole story with illegitimate kings heir edrick storm name sp has disappeared  melissandre burned 3 leeches with his blood to show stannis what she is capable of killing his 3 enemies  renly robb joffrey  and later a hint to make a live dragon by sacrificing that childs lifei do agree that the shadowbaby birth was a great cliffhanger and that 5 episode starts with renlys killing it wasnt very clearly explained until later in the books  so thats why they showed the monsters birth in the first place i thinkoverall the best episode so far"
"David Selig",2012-04-23,"i felt a bit concerned about missing dondarion and then hearing tickler asking the tortured about brotherhood without borders but i read the books i get the feeling that dondarion and his red priest wont be making an appearance due to budget considerations then it leaves the question of reanimating catelyn so i think they wont be killing her to make it easier on a viewer and not the reader  thoros was mentioned in the first season beric even appeared in it most likely they will appear at some point"

"Elimeny",2012-04-23,"this episode provided a better explanation for why arya doesnt have jaghen kill tywin because tywin came in a save gendry from being tortured to death i also think that being tywins cupbearer arya will see him more as a person not just as her familys enemy ive never gotten the impression that tvtywin or booktywin is needlessles cruel and sadistic hes very ambitious and pragmatic and will take very extreme steps to further his goals but he doesnt strike me as someone whos randomly cruel to the servants i never really bought it that arya just forgot to have jaghen kill tywin i think this way shell know that shes supposed to have tywin killed but he saved her friend and if hes kind to her shell find it hard to kill him so well probably get some interesting scenes where arya is torn about what to do vis a vis tywinsuch an excellent point and as someone else stated before its good to keep in mind that martin is working with everyone as well so he must give some sort of approval for each change it helps that he has experience writing tv so he knows the sacrifices that must be made but aside from that i mentioned earlier that i think the tv adaptation is a great opportunity for martin to show different sides of his characters i first noticed this in season 1 with the way cersei was portrayed i found myself unable to hate her  suddenly there was more story to her and she was a much more interesting character this episode gave me the same perspective on tywintheres a part of me that truly believes every time some seemingly strange changes are made to characters that martin wanted to give us a different perspective on them though i doubt very few loved tywin i definitely had a certain level of respect for him the books made it too easy to hate him and i really feel like the tv renditions are changing himmartins characters have always been complex and rendered in shades of gray instead of black and white but the show is doing an even better job of furthering those shades im a lover of character development and the folks at hbo have done an incredible job at this i dont particularly mind the added scenes because they provide more depth to the character  such as the joffros scene joff was a bit young in the books for us to see just how his cruelty would develop i feel they did a good job of taking advantage of the fact that hes aged up in the series  so we can see what the bookjoff would have been like had he been just a few years olderbesides i always wondered what would have happened if tyrion had gotten around to sending a few whores over for joff i thought it would be a great idea that scene helped me answer one of the great imaginative what ifs i had while reading the book"

"J_Crews",2012-04-23,"robb was 14 in the books not 30 as in the showim of the mind robb and joffrey are supposed to be 19 and 16 respectively now that were into season 2 of the show in the books one is a man grown at 16 but tv audiences aint gonna fly with 16 yearolds and younger humping and killing each other over half the kingdomsrobb is king in the north in his own right meaning hes of age joffrey is not otherwise there would be no regent in the books robb was 1516 while joffrey was 12 turning 13 hence the queen regent title for cerseirobb was born at riverrun during roberts rebellion in 283 al jon arryn died in 298 al meaning robb was 15 at the start of the 1st book joffrey on the other hand is listed as being born in 286 al meaning he was only 12dany got similar treatment she was 13 when she married drogo according to grrms own text is anybody really thinking amelia clark 2425 years old was playing her as a 13 year old getting plowed by drogo every night no she looks younger than her age but not by that much she was playing her as more like 17further bran was only 78 and arya 10 in the books yet theyre being played by actors who are 12 and 15 respectively and they dont seem to me to be pretending to be 7 and 10  but rather closer to 1011 and 1213 just my opinionsansa is 13 in the books of an age with joffrey yet shes being played by a 16 year old actress oddly enough she seems to be getting played as little kid vis a vis the queen nosing around and sansa reluctantly admitting to her that she hasnt had her first period yet that seems to maybe have been a bit of a screwupanyway those are my thoughts edited by js crews 23 april 2012  0417 pm"

"Raksha the Demon",2012-04-23,"well i really laughed throughout the whole jeynething can anybody imagine robb stark the king in the north would fall for a common camp follower nurse love does not overcome class distinctions in westeros how can they possibly integrate davos and him being uncomfortable about being a noble of sorts and intend to make this girl a queenit really is too ridiculous to rant about iti also missed renlys peach but stannis davos and especially mel really were awesome this week its a change that stannis is actually privy to the whole shadow thing but i dont mind stannis did know later on when he charged davos to help mel to kill ser cortnaywhat concerns me is that the writers are inserting more and more deviations into the story one or two as in roz prominent role and the lack of damphair dont bother me so much but the story of asoiaf is a tapestry pull out one thread and it will hold even two pull out thread after thread after thread and insert blue thread where there should be red and the tapestry will eventually be far less recognizablesome of the changes ive noticed1 roz not just theons favorite prostitute in the north now she is an important supporting character i think shes getting more screen time than sansa and most of it is semipornographic if i wanted to watch porn i know how to find it i dont want to see porn every season of agot at this point i guess its inevitable id have rather seen them stick to chataya and alayaya as prostitutes in kings landing they were interesting characters 2 no jeyne poole are they going to send roz up north to sub for arya as ramsay boltons bride will anyone believe it3 robbs love interest is a florence nightengale type with a very 20th century attitude from volantis rather than little jeyne westerling maybe the writers thought that the viewers could not handle robb marrying out of duty after sleeping with a minor noblemans daughter or that jeyne was sweet and shy but thats how the character was in the books4 the hound grimaces when sansa is beaten in the throne room but does not speak up to protest they could have included that its far more important as far as i can tell than roz and her friend bouncing on joffreys bed to warm him up or whatever and would have taken less time5 littlefinger seems almost a completely different person in the tv production far from being a superficially pleasant useful financier who controls himself enough to help his game brilliantly succeed hes almost as mouthy as tyrion 6 shae is much older and in my view less realistically portrayed than the character in the book a prostitute who was utterly dependent on the whims of her patron would have been a bit less arrogant at least at this point in the story especially since she has no other friends or allies or resources in kings landing 7 margaery is at least 10 years older perhaps a move to consolidate her with her grandmother and thus spare the need to add the queen of thorns to the cast they could have included the queen of thorns and had one less scene with roz since the qot only has one major scene i would have preferred that natalie dormer play melisandre and that they had found a teenager to play margaery 8 apparently no reeds and no edmure tully in sight i dont know who the red wedding bridegroom is going to be perhaps maester luwin will survive and accompany bran though i dont know if he would be physically strong enough for the long journey in the cold at least no ones fooled around and changed hodor from the book and i dont mind the changes to osha theyre minor and her conversation with theon in season 1 was wonderful 9 joffrey not just being a vicious sociopath who enjoys inflicting pain and torture on practically everyone who annoys him no matter how minor or imagined the slight is hes a sadist who forces prostitutes to hurt each other i think it was more important to the story that joffrey inflict pain and humiliation on sansa and not just one blow and one slap with the sword there were welts on her legs and it was implied that there were several other beatings not just one other than joffrey torturing prostitutes but perhaps the writers are more interested in the storyline of their invented character roz than one of grrms own characters who is an important supporting character in the series joffreys already been depicted as a monster for removing the tongue of the minstrel and trying to choke dontos with wine because the knight was drunk and having sansa beaten the scene with his torturing roz  friend was in my opinion overkill 10 cersei not only was not the one who ordered the massacre of roberts bastards after the kings death implied in the books she was fond enough of robert early in their marriage to have him father a child on her that lessens cerseis ferocity shes been made a softer and more subtle character i prefer the character as grrm wrote her i know that the writers have to compress a great deal of pages and characters i just dont see the reasoning for all the changes ive listed i suppose i should be glad that bronn and tyrion and sam tarly and the old bear and arya are very much in character i enjoyed the first season and some of the second at least so far but i really prefer book scenes to rozporn and i fear that were going to get more rozporn at the cost of dialogue and scenes that grrm createdthe bright spot this episode was tyrion his intervention in the throne room and interaction with joffrey and sansa and then his scene with lancel i guess lancel isnt quite dumb enough to go search for another breastplate stretcher but he comes close"

closeaside from point 2  8 what points affect the tapestry directly it seems to me that most of your criticism is about the show not portraying characters the way you imagined them thats fine but i dont see how they directly influence the plot so joffrey according to you is more sadistic than in the books how does that really change future events same goes for the portrayal of shae and the inclusion of ros so far no major event or development has been left out or changed significantly by them with regards to shae and ros there has not been a real butterfly effect yet also youre assuming that because margaery is older they will leave out qot thats just inventing butterfly effects to make your qualms with the actress age more sifnificant im not saying qot is definitively cast for s3 but im not going to judge margaerys performance in s2 according to something which may or may not be true i understand that these are important changes for you personally but that doesnt mean theyre unraveling the entire tapestry of asoiaf plot for example thats really too soon to tell youre trying to add a gravity to your peeves thats not entirely justified"
"Lyanna Stark",2012-04-24,"strange that we all see things so differently tyrions lady stark line was my absolute favorite in the entire episode i thought it was the perfect movie moment in that it conveyed a world of recognition and respect in just a few words with that line tyrion is saying in my interpretation that he was extremely impressed with the dignity maturity and sheer grownup class with which sansa handled herself following that terrible public humiliation i believe he meant it as a salute to a girl stark whod handled herself as magnificently as if shed been a lady stark i loved it loved itthen you love something that is not in the books or even hinted at in the books thats not wrong but its definitely different just sayin that whole scene was different too so obviously they are changing the sansa  hound interaction to something different they think will work better on screen or somethingits one thing to say omg the mountain is too short another thing to question why certain dialogue choices were lifted for no apparent reason or why the interaction between certain characters were changed while the characters were still there and the scene was set so to speak edited by lyanna stark 24 april 2012  0143 am"
"Rockroi",2012-04-24,"1 roz not just theons favorite prostitute in the north now she is an important supporting character i think shes getting more screen time than sansa and most of it is semipornographic if i wanted to watch porn i know how to find it i dont want to see porn every season of agot at this point i guess its inevitable id have rather seen them stick to chataya and alayaya as prostitutes in kings landing they were interesting characters i agree with your underlying point namely that some thirdlevel characters or lower are getting more face time than pov characters sansa or really solid secondary characters the hound stannis this is a primary difficulty many have with this area of the show now with that said i can definately understand why the writers and producers did not introduce chataya and alaya its ineconomy of characters the authors would have to write in two more characters pay two more actresses time to meet them and give them stuff to say and do so the audiance cares about them and remembers them etc that takes time too much time for any show to legitimately do so they cut some cornerscheat and roz  the whore with the heart of gold pops up everywhere and actas as the writers go to woman whenever the situation calls for it its certainly not good writing its actually very bad writing and its not great tv but in some ways its a necessary evil to keep the show from overproliferating with characters 2 no jeyne poole are they going to send roz up north to sub for arya as ramsay boltons bride will anyone believe itat this point i think they are going to send the other girl in the joff beat up prostitutes scene but i have nothing to go on here 3 robbs love interest is a florence nightengale type with a very 20th century attitude from volantis rather than little jeyne westerling maybe the writers thought that the viewers could not handle robb marrying out of duty after sleeping with a minor noblemans daughter or that jeyne was sweet and shy but thats how the character was in the booksthis is another area that initially has me rolling my eyes but also crossing my fingers yeah no question this character is horribly misplaced and a grand cliche however i am going to try to accept some of her as she is and maybe it will grow on us i can give the benefit of the doubt and hope this works out then again i said the same thing about shea and that turned out to be a huge misfire 4 the hound grimaces when sansa is beaten in the throne room but does not speak up to protest they could have included that its far more important as far as i can tell than roz and her friend bouncing on joffreys bed to warm him up or whatever and would have taken less timethis oirked me a great deal as well why not give the man some dialog and lets have some fun with a character many really enjoy nah instead here is an extended scene of boobies6 shae is much older and in my view less realistically portrayed than the character in the book a prostitute who was utterly dependent on the whims of her patron would have been a bit less arrogant at least at this point in the story especially since she has no other friends or allies or resources in kings landing train wreck i stated it before the writersproducers said that they met the woman who is playing shea and they immediately loved her she was older had a different accent and then they decided almost on a whime to change the character to fit the actress the result its not working and its not just because this womans acting is  uhm different they kept the original sheas story lines but have shoved that sheas dialog into this sheas mouth and its utterly unbelievable the prodcuers thought they did not need to recreate shea just explain away the accent and the age etc and it would work it has not and everytime she talks i am reminded how much its not working 7 margaery is at least 10 years older perhaps a move to consolidate her with her grandmother and thus spare the need to add the queen of thorns to the cast they could have included the queen of thorns and had one less scene with roz since the qot only has one major scene i would have preferred that natalie dormer play melisandre and that they had found a teenager to play margaery i am just going to very politely disagree woith you for starters everyone in the show is older because of the innaporpriateness of some of the actions hey khal drigo hows your 13 year old wife doing pregnant you say wow and how old was she when you married oh i i need an adult i need an adult i also like how this maergery is incorporating the larger styles and messages from these portions of the books yes the queen of thornes may be lost but its an understandable loss as you said yoursel she is in onlya few scenes 9 joffrey not just being a vicious sociopath who enjoys inflicting pain and torture on practically everyone who annoys him no matter how minor or imagined the slight is hes a sadist who forces prostitutes to hurt each other i think it was more important to the story that joffrey inflict pain and humiliation on sansa and not just one blow and one slap with the sword there were welts on her

choke dontos with wine because the knight was drunk and having sansa beaten the scene with his torturing roz  friend was in my opinion overkill perhapse i cannot deny that you bring solid points to bare but also consider this joff in that scene is not just torturing prostitues though its hard to justtalk that point away he is also sending a message to tyrion in a flat and hamhanded attempt to play the game of thrones joff is just coming into his own and the power of his station has not only made him more crazed the attack on the bastards the attack on the prostitues on sansa the singer etc yes hes a fucking nut job but he is also sending the message that he will not be ignored or cowed its a little more layered than just aerys the mad 20 10 cersei not only was not the one who ordered the massacre of roberts bastards after the kings death implied in the books she was fond enough of robert early in their marriage to have him father a child on her that lessens cerseis ferocity shes been made a softer and more subtle character i prefer the character as grrm wrote her to me this is an aethetic change and one that can be debated i do not believe it inherently weakens the series overall i agree with much of what you ahve written and i believe most people who are gaving problems with some episodes fall into camps closely related to the ones you outlined"
"Raksha the Demon",2012-04-24,"i agree with most of what raksha has posted above and would like to subscribe to hisher newsletterthat said i can understand the lack of the reeds and edmure if only because theres so little space and so many characters even without all the ros scenes who im convinced is going to end up as the prince that was promised that itd be bewildering to tv viewers its possible their stories might just have to be left to asos and the comparative breathing room of 2 seasons for a book thats only 100 or so pages longeri agree completely about margaery despite finding the current version utterly hilarious if only because i think that doeeyed innocent margaery from the books is a better player than she lets on and is a worthy protege of the qot but the show version is far more blatant in her desires both her and lf ought to be subtlei think the audience can be trusted to be uneasy about themi completely agree about ros being a waste of time and if they needed a character like her they could have at least used one that was actually supposed to be in kl regardless the role is completely inflated and youre absolutely right overshadows an already marginalized character called sansa starkas for jeyne poole dd did make some joke in the commentary that the girl that sansa was talking to in the pilot was jeyne poole but at any rate nobody knows thati also completely agree about shae tyrion is not some dashing debonair fellow used to getting submissive women and therefore getting a kick out of one that talks back to him for him his relationship with shae is because she is completely his coupled with the selfloathing that its completely fake and paid for with his gold and jewelsim fine with most added sceneschanges weve seen and im not expecting textual literalism in an adaptationthe show is better than most in that regard but ros and shae are the most grating and sansa is the most shabbily treated as a result i dont think its intentional on their partthe commentaries suggest that the creators just really liked biancos acting and that theyre puzzled as to why the fandom dislikes sansa but unfortunately the former is oppressively omnipresent to the point of being a main character and the latter despite exceptional acting by turner isnt given enough of a chance to shineim female but i dont have a newsletter dragon we could do without the reeds for the moment but someone has to accompany bran and hodor up north preferably someone with informative dreams and survival skills maybe one of the reeds will show up later unless

male heirs of great houses can robb put forth to walder frey as a substitute for himself unless the writers plan to have robb just fool around with talisa and break off the engagement with the frey girl and then be persuaded before marrying talisa to marry the frey girl after all  which makes robb look even worse roz will surely end up revealed as princess rhaenys switched and smuggled out of kings landing before tywins forces came in and murdered elia and maybe aegon or shell be a longlost sand snake ackgif classbbcemoticon altack  i like natalie dormer she is fun to watch but part of margaerys appeal in the book was that she was this sweetlooking apparently gentle pretty nice girl whose sharp mind and political acumen were very busy behind those doe eyes she was more than she seemed while natalie dormers margaery is exactly what she seems a charismatic and strongwilled ambitious adult woman it could well be that the girl sansa was talking to in winterfell in season one episode 1 was jeyne poole they could have easily brought her along to kings landing i am convinced that roz will end up being sent north as arya stark to marry a bolton because tvtheon liked her and could reasonably respond to her when they are both frightened captives but it would be preposterous that any bolton andor formerly stark bannermen would actually believe that the 20something roz is arya stark the actress who plays roz doesnt do too badly but her role does not have that much range and much of her screen time is devoted to porn i wonder if roz will substitute for alayaya in getting a whipping on cerseis orders and thus sparking some nasty threats from tyrion and rising hatredfear of him from cersei a man like tyrion would quickly tire of an arrogant backtalking prostitute tyrion wants to be the boss in such relationships his intelligence and verbal skills are topnotch and he prizes them as powerful weapons in a personal arsenal that is low on physical and warrior strength he wants to be the witty acerbic one in a relationship and have the girl admire his intelligence as well as his sexual prowess besides tyrions relationships with both shae and sansa were twisted attempts to redo the truncated romance he had with tysha a sweet grateful 14yearoldgirl shae is neither sweet nor grateful and is older than bookshae i think that the writers created tvshae with an abrasive arrogant for that time and place personality for the same reason they made robbs new girlfriend talisa a selfrighteous nurse who tells him off  they want westerosi women with modern western 21st century attitudes or at least female characters who are far less influenced byinvested in the male sociallegal hierarchy of most of westeros so they can appeal more to modern western 21st century female viewers it doesnt work for me why would the creators of the tv series be surprised that the tvfandom does not like sansa they made her less sympathetic and much more bratty than booksansa in most of the first season the real sansa would never have spoken so rudely to her septa and sophie turners voice was often whiny which i think was by direction ive heard the actress speak in interviews with a very pleasant clear voice i do think miss turner stepped up her acting this season starting actually from her last scene in agot with joffrey dragging her to see her fathers headi will still enjoy much of tvagot but it is rapidly shaping up to be a slightly different story from the actual series and im wondering how much more divergence there will be and to be honest the semiporn or soft porn i dont know the actual definitions is a huge turnoff for me  when sex scenes are presented in the books one can either read them or turn the pages as in the cerseitaena affair which i found rather icky and there is at least a little bit left to the imaginations and to me the theonroz sex the littlefingerrozfriend and now the rozfriend before roz had to seriously hurt her to avoid being shot by joffrey oral stuff was porn i have no objection to porn being available to those who want it i just dont see the need for it in this series when there is already a lot of sex and scenes that could be done in bed or without showing everything and would rather avoid seeing more of it i can only hope that if they ever have ramsey or roose bolton bedding his reluctant wife arya we

of the tv series prefer to spell out too much for us and if theyre end up showing the boltons flaying anyone alive  kyra or theon etc i will probably not buy the dvd theres only so much violence and torture i can stomach i had to fastforward past the tickler and rat sequences in this episodehow could you skip the torture scene that kind of stuff is important it really shows us what kind of horrible stuff arya had to witness i have no problem with sex scenes unless they are pointless and to time consuming because then important stuff has to be cut i also wish the sex scenes were the ones in the books because i feel like all of those had a purpose in one way or anotheri agree that sophie turner has really stepped up her game not that i thought she was bad in the first season or anything its just that she is very good this season thats why it does suck that they are giving her very little screen time sophie turneris exactly how i imagined sansa i think she is utterly perfect"

"Dragon of Valyria",2012-04-24,"im female but i dont have a newsletter dragonjust an expression denoting agreement tonguepng classbbcemoticon altp ive been staying far away from tv spoilers because i like to see things week to week so the only thing i know about the reeds is that they havent been cast so my speculation would be that either theyre going to delay the journey north until next season or at least just set off once theon starts his nonsense and then come across the reeds at that point or there are going to be some very difficult changes to justify given that as far as the books go we dont know whats up with rickon and osha as for the red wedding  hm good point i cant think of anybody with him right now thatd be weighty enough to substitute and itd seem weirdly convenient for edmure to just show up that said ive heard speculation that riverrun plotlines are being held back for the next season in which case he might well show up its possible the creators just dont want to throw too many characters at us at once roz will surely end up revealed as princess rhaenys switched and smuggled out of kings landing before tywins forces came in and murdered elia and maybe aegon or shell be a longlost sand snake ackgif classbbcemoticon altack oh whyd you have to go and say that i happen to like princess rhaenysor rather from what little we know about her i like her sense of humor in naming a kitten balerioni like natalie dormer she is fun to watch but part of margaerys appeal in the book was that she was this sweetlooking apparently gentle pretty nice girl whose sharp mind and political acumen were very busy behind those doe eyes she was more than she seemed while natalie dormers margaery is exactly what she seems a charismatic and strongwilled ambitious adult womansignedit could well be that the girl sansa was talking to in winterfell in season one episode 1 was jeyne poole they could have easily brought her along to kings landing i am convinced that roz will end up being sent north as arya stark to marry a bolton because tvtheon liked her and could reasonably respond to her when they are both frightened captives but it would be preposterous that any bolton andor formerly stark bannermen would actually believe that the 20something roz is arya stark the actress who plays roz doesnt do too badly but her role does not have that much range and much of her screen time is devoted to porn i wonder if roz will substitute for alayaya in getting a whipping on cerseis orders and thus sparking some nasty threats from tyrion and rising hatredfear of him from cerseiyeah they cant possibly use ros for that theyre either just going to have to get a random ladyinwaiting or somehow introduce poole later i really dont know how thats going to work but that definitely seems a butterfly effect candidatei think that the writers created tvshae with an abrasive arrogant for that time and place personality for the same reason they made robbs new girlfriend talisa a selfrighteous nurse who tells him off  they want westerosi women with modern western 21st century attitudes or at least female characters who are far less influenced byinvested in the male sociallegal hierarchy of most of westeros so they can appeal more to modern western 21st century female viewers it doesnt work for meagreed westeros is anachronistic i think it does the audience a disservice to have a mouthpiece that says hey feudalism is unfair sexism is unfair war what is it good for the audience is going to do that themselves they dont need a character to do the thinking for them they need the world to be what the world is im sure some of the peasants are unhappy about being forced to fight in a war but i doubt any of them are going to mouth off to an armed dude in charge of an army we dont know whether talisa is highborn or not yet but it seemed forced why would the creators of the tv series be surprised that the tvfandom does not like sansa they made her less sympathetic and much more bratty than booksansa in most of the first season the real sansa would never have spoken so rudely to her septa and sophie turners voice was often whiny which i think was by direction ive heard the actress speak in interviews with a very pleasant clear voice i do think miss turner stepped up her acting this season starting actually from her last scene in agot with joffrey dragging her to see her fathers headagreed completely i absolutely hated that scene if there was anything sansa was it was courteous even during her captivity she kept her courtesiesthats what the hound teased her about she would not have been sassy and meanspirited to her septa i felt as if they were purposefully trying to make her unlikable during the first season so they could somehow give her a turnaround during the next one a lot of my friends admit to changing their minds about her during acok i think her unpopularity would have handled itself just fine though and while sansas always been the character that i related to best her rudeness to the septa on multiple occasions was uncalled forsophie turner is phenominal though i say this a lot and the reason is because i was really unsure about the casting i didnt know a thing about her other than the name but just because i thought the character would have a challenge for anybody i am glad to say my concerns proved to be unfounded turner is the definitive sansa stark and thank goodness for that i think she played her brilliantly from the pilot onwardi think my favorite two scenes with her were the pilot banquet when she was every bit the bubbly young girl she was but demurely in control and the awkward family dinner and shae scene of the previous episode where you saw this huge range of emotions play across her face in scenes where she otherwise spoke evenly in both instances she gets across emotion while still putting on the mask that the character had to put on and thats a rare talent i cant sing her praises enough thats probably why i enjoyed her scenes with tyrion this episode theyre the two finest actors in a production with a lot of good actors imoi will still enjoy much of tvagot but it is rapidly shaping up to be a slightly different story from the actual series and im wondering how much more divergence there will be and to be honest the semiporn or soft porn i dont know the actual definitions is a huge turnoff for me  when sex scenes are presented in the books one can either read them or turn the pages yeah we expected nudity and violence coming in im not a prude and when its necessary useful andor artistic go for it ross scenes werent thoseespecially hooker academyâ<U+0084> which had the added problem of telegraphing littlefingers intentions in the episode ending in his surprise betrayal of ned i didnt mind the nudity with mel because it had a purpose both times but the ros scenes are just porn plain and simple and its a problem because there are a lot of people id love to introduce the show to and who id think would enjoy it but for those really tacky porn scenesi dont mind sex or nudity when it serves a legitimate point i dont mind diverging from the books when it has a point tooand a lot of their changes and additions have been right on the money so im fine with those but the porn has got to stop if this show is going to keep any selfrespect enough with ros already i know dd said they liked her and wrote more stuff with her because of that but come on i cant think of a ros scene thats contributed anything new outside of her first scene and maybemaybe the babykilling scene edited by dragon of valyria 24 april 2012  0343 am"

"Ghost714",2012-04-24,"i am completely on the fence regarding this episode it would seem with only the inclusion of exact lines of dialogue from the novels that hboasoiaf is becoming a distinctly different animal im not a fanatical novelpurist but at some point one has to wonder about the butterfly effect many of these alterations to the original will haveis there any possible way to balance out the egregious level of female nudity with male nudity not exclusive to that of the renlyloras variety im mean fair is fair is it not the female on female variety now boarders on redundant its not even interesting enough to bore me antlered septer or no hes a psychopathyes thank youbefore i was unclear about his lack of marshmallow center and gooey goodnessive got that straight nowmargery julia child called she wants her funnel back so i guess youll have to find an idle cheese grater to fashion into a fascinating ensemblenurse volantis just no please do not tell me that were traveling down this road with robb and volantis is this not the same storyline available to the masses devoted to daytime soap operas throw in star crossed lovers and were off to young and the restless territorydavos does not want you melisandre he is revolted by you he is a better man than stannis wtflf what the fuckjust whatever for pretty much the entire thing imojust because davos does not like melisandre that does not mean he cant be physically attracted to her any guy with eyes would be attracted to melisandre she is beautiful mysterious and very powerful hell even a lot of woman would be attracted to melisandre so i have no problem with that scene at alland there is never going to be the same amount of male nudity to female nudity its not like this show is the first show to be unfair thats how it is with almost any show or movie male viewers just have more of a desire to see female nudity and not nearly as many females want to see male nudity just like how guys as a whole watch porn more than woman as a whole and i actually think it can be argued that there is quite a bit of male nudity in this show way more so than a lot of other shows i know its not near as much as the female nudity but thats just the way of the worldi also think you should give the robb love story some more time before you judge it most like she was jeyne westerling pretending to be a nobody from volantisi do agree about the butterfly effect and i have the same belief as grrm when it comes to an adaptation you should stick to the source material as much as possible the show should not be something completely different than the books grrm has even said if you cant stick with the original story then dont make the adaptation write your own story and thats what i dont understand grrm ultimately has no control over the show if they want to make a drastic change he has no power to stop them yet when grrm agreed to let them do the show he expressed that it was his wishes for them to stick to the original story as much as possible and dd are big fans of the books and grrm so i thought that they would try and respect grrms wishes as best as they could the first season was so good because they stuck to the books very closely i dont understand why they changed so much for season two most of the changes to the first season were bugetory reasons and that is completely understandable but the changes in season two are ridiculous for the record i am not talking about condensing aryas story and stuff like that we all know which changes have been ridiculous and pointless if they are making so many changes now then i really fear for the future story because there is going to be so much butterfly effect that they will be forced to make huge changes down the road even if they dont neccisarily want to because they made so many pointless changes already"

"Raksha the Demon",2012-04-25,"i really liked the episode it went by really fast so much so that i was genuinely surprised when it ended there seems to be a lot of discussion and controversy rightly so about the joffrey and the whores scene it was certainly disturbing but if you think about it it wasnt really graphic most is left up to the imagination of the viewer to fill in the blanks after the cut away ive kind of been of two minds myself about it as well one it did seem overly long but it also showed the viewers again without any blood or gore what a psychopath joffrey is even though we all knew he was a bit of a sick puppy but his reaction to the women in his room was completely different from what any of us and certainly tyrion who would not send whores in if he knew what would go down expectedmaureen ryan at huffpost tv broke down the scene brilliantly and explained why it was so disturbing she says it better than i canas for joffrey we already knew he was a sick sadist but the scene with the prostitutes gave us yet another reason to store up our own hatred for this murderous brat game of thrones has gotten a lot of crap for its sexposition and its affinity for boobs but id like to point out that this scene was not exploitative of the female characters in the least in fact it did what some other scenes in the show havent done it took us inside the experience the women were having and it made us feel their emotions and reactions the women werent mere objects in the scene they were human beings for whom i felt sympathy and pity this scene wasnt about sex or nudity and there was very little of either this was about joffreys despicable need to exercise the very worst kind of power over others and one can only begin like other characters in this tale to pray for the day that his head is separated from his body what bothers us so much is that these women are not just boobs and a vagina with a head stuck on they are people despite the fact that ros is somewhat unpopular she is a character that we know a lot about and even care a bit about at least when something like this happens to her we know she used to schtup theon she came to kl to make it big as a backalleysally she was extremely upset about the baby killing and now what she and the other girl who we last saw with pycell thought was an easy job deflowering a teenager turns into a nightmarethis episode was about the little people in the realm and how all this war upheaval and general shittiness is affecting them contrast sansa sweeping out of the throne room with her ladies after being saved by tyrion with the whores no one was coming the save them even littlefinger who was away would only be upset at the loss of revenue the big players planned battles or set in their castles while the peasants were being tortured and murdered at harrenhal the scene with robb and sassynurse standing in for jeyne westerling was heavy handed but she was right most of the soldiers in this war arent valiantly fighting to see their sisters released while seeking vengence for the murder of their father some of them are knights but a lot of them are just fishermen farmers or tradesman who dont have anything to do with the aristocracy and the game of thronesits been awhile since i read acok but i really remember getting the feeling from the book that war is just bad it doesnt matter who is fighting it or why it is just bad not to say that there arent reasons that sometimes we have to fight joffrey is a sadistic psychopath who shouldnt be in any position of power he gets out from under his mothers thumb and him torturing a couple whores is going to be the least of everyones problemsoh and melisandres shadowbaby was awesome the whole renlystannisdavosmelisandre plotline was great this week is he a hamim not sure that maureen ryan saw the same garden of bones as i did or maybe our perception varies so much as to make an accurate consensus impossible i saw plenty of nudity in the episode and more oral sex than i wanted to see on television as for sansa being untouchable and the whores being far more vulnerable i would say that sansa is in greater danger on a daytoday basis  if something happens to jaime lannister cersei might well decide to let joffrey kill sansa at least in the books sansa never knew which day she would be subject to beatings from the kingsguard on joffreys whim and she was utterly terrified and about to be hurt possibly badly and its not certain that sansa would be rescued again if joffrey becomes annoyed with her tyrion does not make any longterm changes to sansas situation and hes not always going to necessarily charge in at the right moment roz and the other whores presumably have the option of going to another city if they have enough coin to relocate and not all of their clients are sadists on the level of joffrey which isnt to say that sansa hasnt had an easy life compared to roz before ned stark died but at the moment sansas existence is quite stressful and subject to danger and i didnt read asoiaf to read about the lives and struggles of prostitutes i was interested in chataya and alayaya because grrm wrote them well and also knew not to make alayaya the omnipresent prostitute who services theon tries to service jon snow services pycelle and is king joffreys nameday present i dont want to see roz and her companion abused by joffrey because they dont deserve it but that does not mean i want to see a continuing plot thread about the lives of prostitutes or just roz in the entire series shae in the books was a welldrawn character seen from tyrions perspective which made her more interesting than she probably was there are many other major and minor characters in asoiaf who show the inhumanity of war and the evil of which humans are capable all too frequently i would have rather seen more scenes with the innkeeper of the inn at the crossroads the woman who is a capable innkeeper managing a fairly profitable business and then murdered by tywin lannister for having allowed catelyn stark to snatch tyrion as if the innkeeper could have prevented an armed company from seizing him  a ghastly incident that takes place offcamera but is still haunting  than more roz scenestheres no question that war is hell and westerosi war is painful unpleasant and fatal for a lot of people including many peasants farmers etc who have no interest in playing the game of thrones but who are caught up in it but it came out very cliched when the volantene florence nightengale was lecturing robb stark about it why not have catelyn who as an older person and a mother might have sympathy for all these boys who are going to die for her son tell robb the same thing so he will at least throw away the cannon fodders lives less easily i just dont think this gal would have lasted too long as a battlefield nurse in westeros if she made a habit of lecturing generals who are also feudal lords about the evils of war she was right of course but her words and attitude sounded far more abrasive than a young woman of westeros would think of using on meeting the king of the north it wasnt a terrible episode by any means but it just showed me that the television show is slipping farther away from the original story than i would like but at least for the moment i can live with that though i do and probably will continue to grumble about itand i did love renlys line is he a ham rolleyesgif classbbcemoticon altrolleyes   poor renly without him there will be no one to try to convince stannis to get over

"Ghost714",2012-04-25,"im not sure that maureen ryan saw the same garden of bones as i did or maybe our perception varies so much as to make an accurate consensus impossible i saw plenty of nudity in the episode and more oral sex than i wanted to see on television as for sansa being untouchable and the whores being far more vulnerable i would say that sansa is in greater danger on a daytoday basis  if something happens to jaime lannister cersei might well decide to let joffrey kill sansa at least in the books sansa never knew which day she would be subject to beatings from the kingsguard on joffreys whim and she was utterly terrified and about to be hurt possibly badly and its not certain that sansa would be rescued again if joffrey becomes annoyed with her tyrion does not make any longterm changes to sansas situation and hes not always going to necessarily charge in at the right moment roz and the other whores presumably have the option of going to another city if they have enough coin to relocate and not all of their clients are sadists on the level of joffrey which isnt to say that sansa hasnt had an easy life compared to roz before ned stark died but at the moment sansas existence is quite stressful and subject to danger and i didnt read asoiaf to read about the lives and struggles of prostitutes i was interested in chataya and alayaya because grrm wrote them well and also knew not to make alayaya the omnipresent prostitute who services theon tries to service jon snow services pycelle and is king joffreys nameday present i dont want to see roz and her companion abused by joffrey because they dont deserve it but that does not mean i want to see a continuing plot thread about the lives of prostitutes or just roz in the entire series shae in the books was a welldrawn character seen from tyrions perspective which made her more interesting than she probably was there are many other major and minor characters in asoiaf who show the inhumanity of war and the evil of which humans are capable all too frequently i would have rather seen more scenes with the innkeeper of the inn at the crossroads the woman who is a capable innkeeper managing a fairly profitable business and then murdered by tywin lannister for having allowed catelyn stark to snatch tyrion as if the innkeeper could have prevented an armed company from seizing him  a ghastly incident that takes place offcamera but is still haunting  than more roz scenestheres no question that war is hell and westerosi war is painful unpleasant and fatal for a lot of people including many peasants farmers etc who have no interest in playing the game of thrones but who are caught up in it but it came out very cliched when the volantene florence nightengale was lecturing robb stark about it why not have catelyn who as an older person and a mother might have sympathy for all these boys who are going to die for her son tell robb the same thing so he will at least throw away the cannon fodders lives less easily i just dont think this gal would have lasted too long as a battlefield nurse in westeros if she made a habit of lecturing generals who are also feudal lords about the evils of war she was right of course but her words and attitude sounded far more abrasive than a young woman of westeros would think of using on meeting the king of the north it wasnt a terrible episode by any means but it just showed me that the television show is slipping farther away from the original story than i would like but at least for the moment i can live with that though i do and probably will continue to grumble about itand i did love renlys line is he a ham rolleyesgif classbbcemoticon altrolleyes   poor renly without him there will be no one to try to convince stannis to get over himselfwhere was there to much oral sex in this episode i actually dont remember any in this episode and there really was not a lot of nudity at all in this episode how is that you can say stannis needs to get over himself while also saying something about renly in the same breath renly was so full of himself that he though he should be king and to hell with the line of succession everything about renly his clothes his tournaments his peach it all screams that he is full of himself stannis even said in the books that he never wanted to be king but it was his duty to because he was the next in line and he believes laws should be followed and that laws should be made of iron not pudding then we have renly who thinks he would just be the best king ever laws be damnedstannis also was not the one who was saying he was the lord of lights chosen one or anything that was all melisandre all stannis said was that the iron throne was his by right which is trueyou are worried about renly not being around to help stannis get over himself but i am glad stannis had renly killed because there was no hope of him getting over himself"

"Onion Smuggler",2012-04-25,"my twopenneth worth so it seems that season 2 is deviating from the books far more than season 1 ive had to try and detach the books from the show because the deviations do annoy me the whores scene with joffrey was so unnessecary to the story we dont need to hate joff more than we already do it was gratuitous torture porn i know the show is meant to be adult and have lots of sex which enhances the story and character development but to me this scene wasnt needed lf showing his emotions to cat again not sure about that but even more strange was his encounter with margaery tyrell although i suppose it did show her scheming nature i think they are just playing up lfs love for cat so its clear what his actions are at the end of asos on a bright note i liked robbs meeting with jeyne although im not sure why she lied about her identity i thought she came across well and really got the better of him the opening scene with the lannister guardsmen was good grey wind looked brilliant tyrion was fantastic as usual and his chastisement of lancel was how i pictured it danys speech was very well done also emilia clarke did well there she got the vunerability of dany and her khalasar across but showed her strength and persuasive ability too wasnt really sure about the spice trader sort of reminded me of uncle monty from withnail and i the shadow baby was fantastic cgi the whole scene was really well done it looked really good and came off perfectly 1010 for the graphics team mel and davos there all in all in was a good episode which despite the plot deviations came off as possibly the best the season"

"J_Crews",2012-04-25,"untruestannis is king his desire to be king has literally nothing to do with stannis actions in fact iirc in the books stannis specifically says that he simply became king when robert died and that his desires play no roll in the decision stannis is the king and much like robb stark and jon snow stannis does his duty with grim determination when ned becamse hand he literally thought that it was the last thing he wanted would ned have been noble had he refused robert nobody questions neds motivations same with jon snow spoiler if jon snow really wanted to couldnt he just refuseto be lord commander but wouldnt that be shirking his duty how come its okay for john to accept being lord commander and nobody gives him grief for doping so but stannis gets grief for doing his same duty here with stannis stannis became king because robert died with no trueborn children for stannis to deny this would be tantamount to treason in stannis mind his duty requires him to be king once robert accepted the crown stannis always thought it was a possibility and now has to as opposed to wants to act on it this is what makes renlys treason so anathema in satnnis mind renly is absolutely not the king renlys argument  that nobody wants stannis to be their king is irrelevant nobody elected robert aerys daeron or aegon king want has absolutely nothing to do with this renly is stannis heir and that should have been that the same way stannis was robertsstannis baratheon is doing his duty people ignore this because stannis duty is not one that requires sacrafice its good to be king as tom petty said many moons ago and so if stannis is trying to be king nobody attaches good or noble motives to that but take a step back much in the same way ned and jon and robb and many others do their duty is the same way stannis does his that in and of itself has nobility and honor to itthough he could be nicer about it here here agree with every word to be honest the ideas you so accurately spelledout here are why i have always had a soft spot for stannis hes a king before whom i would gladly bend the knee he is a truly just man even the spider says so in the books i dont agree with everything he says and does but ill take a just king even one might sometimes be too rigid who is fulfilling the role because he genuinely believes it is his duty and he therefore has no choice but to do his best over a greedy grasping king who wants the throne for his own aggrandizement any daythat said renly might actually have been a great king but he had no right and comparing his situation to roberts seizing the throne by rising to depose his rightful king because he happened to be an insane tyrant is a laughable analogy one must recall that robert didnt just declare himself king the rebellion succeeded and then he endedup on the iron throne only because of the victors he had the best claim house baratheons founder having been rumored to have been a bastard brother of aegon the conqueror and roberts own grandmother having been princess rhaelle targaryen daughter of aegon v known to us as egg from the dunk  egg novellas as such robert had royal blood through the female line causing him to be declared king"
"J_Crews",2012-04-25,"your whole arguement though is defeated with one monologue from maester aemon in season 1it was his duty to take the thone and he declined it to become a maester wrong he was already a maester at that point the crown was quietly offered to him true but the great council was contemplating doing something unheard of by having the high septon absolve him of his maesters oath so he could take the crown should oaths be so fluid a thing that they can be set aside so easily i think not i do believe however that had egg not been there as a fallback aemon would have had no choice but to set aside his personal honor and accept for the good of his house and the kingdom as a whole"

"Ghost714",2012-04-25,"ghost i think you and i will just have to agree to disagree about the amount of nudity in the episode as for seeing more oral sex than i wanted to i didnt want to see any oral sex i would think that roz sticking her head between the other prostitutes legs and behaving in terms of physical motion like she was doing sexual things constituted a very close facsimile of oral sex if it didnt it was still more than enough for me and totally unnecessary to advance or enrich the story that particular moment did not last long but it was not even in the books i think that for some reason perhaps to satisfy some unwritten hbo rule that there must be nudity and sex in every other episode no i havent counted the producers and writers of the series are making an effort to include blatant acts of sex by naked people as opposed to people in a bed or partially nude whatever im not a puritan but i dont care for pornography and there is a lot of material in this series that if not technically porn and it looks like it to me comes very close to it the sexual scenes between drogo and dany were absolutely storylinedictated even though they changed the way he treated her on their wedding night the progression of sexual pleasure and love between them was very well done and came mostly from the books the bathtub scene between  doreah and viserys was not but at least was a better case of exposition is the term they use sexposition cant remember than the unbelievable scene where littlefinger bares his innermost thoughts and memories to roz  friend while the women are having sex with each other or stimulating it it looked close enough  as if littlefinger would ever reveal such information even though he didnt name specific people to his employees i agree that there can be a lot of pointless sex and nudity in the show but compared to most episodes this one was not bad at all again you complained about having to see to much oral sex in this episode but i think your confused about what actually happened in the scene with joff ros and that one whore ros goes to touch joff and he says  no touch her so then ros goes to touch the whore that gets beaten and ros is kissing her stomach and working her way down as soon as ros gets to the other whores vagina joff says  can you hit her so ros is only kissing the other whore on the stomach for a few seconds and there really was not any oral sex going on especially compared to the first episode when we first see tyrion we have to graphically hear him getting a oral sex from ros same goes for renly and loras in the first episode we have to hear renly getting graphic oral sex so thats all i am saying compared to other episodes this one was nothing and i dont think ros actually ever gave the other whore oral sex if she did it lasted for one second before joff asked ros to hit the other girl and she was only kissing her stomach for a few seconds so all and all i cant see how this episode would make any one see to much oral sex especially compared to other episodesagain though i agree that a lot of the sex scenes are dumb this season and i agree that the first season like with dany and drogo had a purpose and they went along with the book really its just the made up whores that have pointless sex scenes this season i think the one with melisandre and stannis had a purpose same with renly and margaery and renly and lorasif you count that as a sex scene so if the just stopped the pointless stuff with littlefinger and his whores and if they stuck to the books it would be fine the funny thing is in acok most the sex scenes were with tyrion and shae and they havent showed any of those this season i mean tyrion had sex with shae enough in acok to wear hbo wouldnt need to add any sex scenes if they showed all of them but they havent shown any of them its weird"

"footballcoach",2012-04-26,"there is a second message in the joff scene that people seem to gloss over quite quickly joffrey asks several times my uncle sent you i took that to mean he is trying to get back at tyrion for publicly embarrasing him on several occasions not only is joff cruel and sadistic already established he is also threatened by tyrionhe handles this in his own vile way violent repression is joffs strategy in the game the scene was less gratuitous than other scenes imogood pointif that was their goal then i believe it could have been done in other ways to be clear im not against the sex or nudity there was plenty of that in the books and martin used it expertly in crafting the story hbos adaptation is just gratuitous prolonged and pointless like others have said they are leaving out critical plot elements in favor of these kinds of scenes and its causing the entire package to feel very shallowi wish they would have taken a more measured approach like lost sopranos or breaking bad for example while you can criticize the outcome of a series like lost the pacing was incredibly effective that same pacing was already in the first 2 or 3 got books so why not use it i think martin used sex and violence effectively to tell the story so it is difficult to understand how more of both is considered an improvement to the story while sacrificing critical plot developments to show them i mean i know its about ratings and shock value but doesnt it piss anyone else off that they are using these elements more than intended in order to boost viewership i guess the response there for many is yes if it means the series survives and i would have to agree on that as wellyes its an adaptation of the books fully understood not everything will be exact or even possible to screenplay but you gotta get kinda in the same ballpark you know i mean you can adapt your way into a very shallow and hard to understand story if you arent careful with the pacing character development and plot reveals lost did this masterfully by introducing characters as a whole then shifting focus to individual or shared character plot lines then they weaved these relationships back into the overall story kinda like martin did in his books"

"zippypoodle",2012-04-22,"and i need to keep reminding myself that these arent the books so that every departure doesnt seem so annoyingrather than respond as id like to the purists ill just give you kudos for this attitude insteadvery good episode im interested to see where they take the talisa thing and whether she is taking the jeyne westerlinglannister role or is a temporary fling for rob my bet is on the former and there is nothing that prevents her yet from being a lannister although the accent makes me doubt it"
"The Greenseer",2012-04-22,"i gave it an 8 but on further consideration probably should have been a 7 if the show has to make cuts due to screen time  budget constraints why add so much crap in that isnt even in the books examples joff and hookersjoff is already evil enough we dont need additional made for tv scenes to drive that point home robb and silent sister has no point unless that turns out to be jeyne which seems to make no sense lf and cat lets get it together baby heres your husbands bones what lame bs dany getting belligerent with the qarth whats the point there will be plenty of time for her to grow into her royal self highly unlikely after starving in the desert and begging for food other disappointments the mountain that rides looks more like the tree that walks put some stuffing under that armor and bulk homeboy up a bit mels shadow babies looked more like a black fog machine than a shadow i think it could have been done more like well a shadow also my wife who has not read the books was lost and had many questions which has me fearing for the overall viewership of the show the fast dialogue with thick accents are not helping much particularly the stannisdavos scene any non book viewer had to be wondering wtf they were talking about same with the arya prisoner scenes imo it was not clear as to where they were and what info the torturers were trying to get if you were a non reader edited by the greenseer 23 april 2012  0911 am"
"Lord Godric",2012-04-22,"not as good as last weeks imo but still phenomenal i gave it an 8 some very greatly acted scenes and this is one of those episodes where they rewrote things for the show and it really works well to push the story along im thinking mainly of the catlittlefinger stuff and the reworking of the boat scene with mel and davos"
"Tadco26",2012-04-22,"gave it a 7 some really great scenes that were like watching the book come to life and some really poorly written scenes that made me cringe i liked tyrion they have kept his scenes very close to the book material and his character and scenes have flourished because of it lancel did a great job with his part as well tickler looked as i imagined nice mention of the brotherhood though it brings to question why they didnt have ser amory looking for the brotherhood instead of gendry last episode as i suspected we are asked to believe that ser amory personally went searching for gendry by name with his patrol but didnt even get the basic physical description that he was dark haired and so they believed aryas lie harrenhal looked pretty cool but one of my nonreader friends was confused on where all these other people came from and what village they were asking about during the torture since we never saw a village on the show or any captives being taken from them shadow baby awesome scene i didnt like some of the dialogue leading up to it such as mel suggesting that davos wanted her but the birthing looked about perfect apparently there is some confusion among non readers because it was more black smoke baby than shadow but it worked for me dislikes joffrey and the whores not because it was poorly acted it wasnt and not because joffrey wouldnt possibly do this he might it just was a really long scene when you include tyrions dialogue with the hound setting it up and it didnt add anything of importance to the story this is the type of original scene that i really dislike not because it wasnt in the book but because so many great scenes from the book have to be cut due to time restrictions but they find so much time for this rather pointless scene if there was 20 episodes for this season it would be a minor foot note but with only 10 time is precious and there are better things they could spend that time on qarth this scene was really awkwardly written dany threatening that she is going to come back and burn the city down later when she admits that if they dont let her in she and her group will die in the context of tv game of thrones why dont the thirteen just force her to give up her dragons her kalisar in the books is weak but still several hundred people even if many are women elderly and xaro comes to her in the dead city that dany is camped at and recovering and invites her to come so that the 13 can pay homage and see her dragons but in the show for her to threaten them when they are basicly her only hope for survival rather than just show them at least one of the dragons seemed silly the fart joke leading up to the stark attack two fart jokes in the first four episodes isnt exactly what i would go with if your trying to get fantasy to be taken seriously and not as sophomoric entertainment disappointing that all the battles have to be cut due to budget nice to see the flash of grey wind though i also think they are way over playing renly and loras relationship its something that many readers miss on until it is pointed out and never struck me as something that common menatarms would have any knowledge of other thoughts cat and littlefinger was well acted but im not sure i like where it is going if it results in jamie being released before spoiler rickon and brans death missed not seeing renlys peach and seeing lightbringer glowing for the first time reserving judgement on talisa from volantis and what appears to be a romantic story line for robb reserving judgement on arya being tywins cup bearer it seems like arya not thinking about naming tywin as one of her 3 is much more far fetched if she is interacting with him daily wish they would just have had stannis recount the entirety of how davos became ser davos leaving out the onions and the history is the type of thing that could have been covered if they werent spending so much time on joffrey and his whores sadist scene edited by tadco26 22 april 2012  1131 pm"

"PatrickStormborn",2012-04-23,"i rated it a 10 despite all the violence i thought it was an outstanding episode with much stronger writing than episode 3qarth this scene was really awkwardly written dany threatening that she is going to come back and burn the city down later when she admits that if they dont let her in she and her group will die in the context of tv game of thrones why dont the thirteen just force her to give up her dragons her kalisar in the books is weak but still several hundred people even if many are women elderly and xaro comes to her in the dead city that dany is camped at and recovering and invites her to come so that the 13 can pay homage and see her dragons but in the show for her to threaten them when they are basicly her only hope for survival rather than just show them at least one of the dragons seemed silly the qartheen dont know how powerful the dragons are nor do they want to ruin their reputationi thought her entry into qarth was more believable than in the books"

"Davos55",2012-04-23,"i would give it an 85 so i rounded up to a 9 due to finally seeing roose bolton and the excellent grey wolf scene great opening to the episode though i could have done without another fart joke it just doesnt make sense for this show and bolton was awesome in his short scene i feel like tyrion and twin stole the show this week tyrion is always amazing and his scenes with sansa and lancel were very well done tywin just has some great presence to him that i cant really explain but i just always think he kills it in every scene he is in probably because dance is an amazing actor i liked him just strolling in and calling polliver an idiot as far as davos goes they should just fully explain his backstory so the nonbook readers know what he is talking to stannis and mel about i also really dont like that mel suggests that he wants her i dont buy that for a second very strange shadow baby was pretty legit though i dont know how i feel about jeyne westerling field nurse volantene girl yet initially i am not impressed danys scenes at qarth with the spice king were pretty funny for some reason i really hope we get to see more of the dragons this season though not just drogon i would have liked a mention of beric dondarrion and nonbook readers probably had no idea what village or brotherhood they were talking about interesting tickling methodnot done by the tickler totally brought me back to the opening of fast and furious 2 where they tortured a guy the same way the whore scene took way too long and was just a little ridiculous in my opinion also is the actress that plays ros pregnant or something she looks different and always has tons of clothes on now but that was just my random thought that other whore is having some bad luck lately dont know why i wrote so much but anyways good episode cant wait til next week as always"

"Ferrum Aeternum",2012-04-23,"810 overall a very good episode with a few odddisappointing turns for me there were some great scenes and certainly more positives than negatives but not quite as good as last weeks the two tyrion scenes were his best yet this season as far as im concerned enjoyed the entire qarth sequence the spice king was a pleasant surprise  i wasnt expecting much but was quite entertained by his delivery and mannerisms i think the xarodany dynamic will be more interesting on the show than the books version which i found to be one of the more predictable and boring parts of acok the parley was extremely welldone despite one glaring omission more later and the shadowbaby scene was riveting and phenomenally wellexecutedthat said while i dont mind the talisa storyline per se and certainly agree with the function that it serves the initial interaction with her and robb felt unconvincing to me the situation felt contrived and the dialogue and some of the delivery seemed forced  something im not used to seeing on this show also the joffwhores scene while well executed and certainly effective in its message was unnecessary and took time away from other potentially more relevant uses of screen time yes we know joff is dangerously sadistic  we just saw as much in the directly previous scene when he threatened sansa with a loaded crossbow and had her beaten theres a fine line between unsubtle and overkill and having a concept so obvious bludgeoned into the audiences head insults its intelligence also wasnt wild about the catlittlefinger scene although the presentation of neds bones helped redeem its shortcomings a bit i do wish theyd shown the actual bones though  i talked to two nonreaders last night who thought theyd just sent neds head in the box ohmypng classbbcemoticon alto oh and there shoulda been a peach no reason for there not to be a peach tonguepng classbbcemoticon altp definitely looking forward to next week though  all hell promises to break loose on a number of fronts"

"Giskard Reventlov",2012-04-23,"i gave it a 7 because i didnt like the changes they made in regards to the books most of all the littlefinger for couple of episodes now he is exact opposite of subtle manipulator he is in the books he reveals his thoughts and feelings to everyone littlefinger in the books would never taunt cersei or margarey in that way i dont understand at all why is robs future wife and that was probably her  a girl from volantis instead from minor noble house but i dont care much althoug i dont like it new mountain was not as good as previous stannis and renley were ok and after the shadow baby whole scene with stanis and melisandre in previous episodes look less stupid though stanis still talks about the son still dont like the melisandre casting not enough fire in this actress and even physically is not what i expected edit i already mentioned that on other thread i dont mind sex scenes at all however jofreey  whores was unnecessary because it wastes time and does not tell us anything new it is well known from the scenes with sansa that he is psychopath edited by giscard reventlov 23 april 2012  0150 pm"
"Ser Graymax",2012-04-23,"sorry i had to only give this one a 6 it would have been a 5 but the scenes that were really good were so good that they dragged up the scenes that were really bad the new mountain did little more than be big but tywin really overpowered that scene with charisma i love naked women but really the scene with joeffry and the barbie doll that was milisandre painful to watch both and not in a good way like it started out very uneven directing and even the dialog seemed lacking xaro looked foolish and phoned in his lines but the spice merchant was a great character and scene stealer tickler scene was also a disappointment along with aryas first prayer list i look foreward to next weeks episode blowing me away like last weeks heres hoping"
"Ruka",2012-04-23,"i dont think people are giving the joffros scene enough thought i thought it was a good scene to show nonbook readerslisteners that joff isnt just a douche to sansa when given a gift from tyrion someone who has repeatedly humiliated him publicly joff takes out his petulent behaviors on people that are in no way to blame for his shamings throw into the mix the slap in the face tyrion actually sends to joff by sending a whore he has already used way back in s1e1 is it any wonder she is hand picked by tyrion he has had her what better slight to joff really than to send off his leavings to the king i rather enjoyed most of the episode as i have most of them i divorce my book knowledge from my show knowledge as much as i can when watching i still get excited when things like the brienne reveal and dejected when renly doesnt fast draw a peach on his brother but i let the show stand on its own merits also"
"A Redeemed Hound",2012-04-23,"i have to admit that the more i think about it the less excited i am for the rest of the season last season was great this season is just a choppy mess with little to no explanation as to what is going on or why does it cost that much to show all three dragons here and there or a wolf scene for more than a tenth of a second but we get hours of porn and prostitutes and little time of sansa and joff together or sansa and the hound if that is what the hbo audience wants well then the hbo audience is full of morons thank god there are the books i am not happy about this season so far and arent these supposed to be an hour long what is with the 40  45 minute episodes"
"ghost the direwolf",2012-04-23,"10 i loved everything better than the last 2 my only problem is that it did seem very short"
"Milgod morghulis",2012-04-23,"best episode of the season by far joff acting like a pure dick is making my nonbook reading wife hate him even more last season she just thought of him as a little boy who did stupid things now she wants to kill him herself some of you must have read different books to me because there doesnt even seem that much sex imo i thought the tickler was creepy the shadow was immense i was hoping roose would have been a bit softer in his speech but he looked great harrenhal looked amazing somebody mentioned the silent sisters talking i didnt see that bit wherewhen was it"
"Rob the God",2012-04-23,"75 ranked it as an 7 its got so my expactions are high overall a goodvery good episode hbo did a wonderful job again this time they made more changes but they keep every important plot point so its okay except the whore scene what i liked tyrion lancel scene tyrion at his best camera work for example parley between baratheon brothers battlefield with robb set and art direction were awesome as always  shadow was very well done didnt expect that  dany in front of quarth emilia is doing an outstanding job i think its anoth example of how got is at its bet when they take their time  the added scenes with littlfinger cat had the best perfomance of the week the acress really overplayed dont know if thats a word littlefinger that part was bit of overacted i think also liked his little chat with margery and renly it fits the story and makes me happy to see littlf betting on the false brother  hate tywin but perfectly but this episode i was happy to see him and chalres dance is just perfect in this role"
"Reposado",2012-04-23,"along with aryas first prayer listyeah um her list was pretty exclusive than that one guy hits that random woman arya doesnt know and gets himself on the list not the guy who had yoren killed in front of her not the guy that killed lommy and laughed that dudeand obviously they do that so that she has a name to tell jaqensome good stuff in this episode but a lot of of poor choicesstannis and renly being in the same spot suddenly with no explanationdavos needing to smuggle mel into the coast when stannis had clearly landed there in the middle of the day yesterday"
"Drogon's Personal Trainer",2012-04-23,"well after all the kerfuffle on various fora regarding how ott the prostitute and torture scenes were ive come to the conclusion that i am one hardassed woman i honestly didnt find them overyuk rome had worse than this i did also get the joffrey scene  he gave us the crucial line that he wanted tyrion to find out about it so i think it was his way of getting back at his uncle for stopping the humiliation of sansa and just as an aside  i think another poster  either here or on the twop  wondered if esme bianco ros was pregnant ive thought that since the first episode im sure thats why shes keeping her clothes on and i swore i saw a little bump in episode 1 her face is a little fuller too id say definitely preggers as for the episode  i loved it from start to finish gave this a 9 i chopped one point off for the direction of the qarth scene something about it just failed to convince me i was in the moment it wasnt the actors but rather the static direction i do hope things pick up across the sea the series this year seems to have done a disservice to danys story  although i know they have the constraints of the book and she spent an awful long time in the red waste grey windrobb was beautifully placed and as for shadow baby  that was superb i also loved the juxtaposition of the two scenes that had some humour tyrionlancel and stannisdavos stannis and davos are becoming one heck of a double act nor have i ever been one who has been disappointed with the casting of stephen dillane hes a superb actor and he plays stan exactly as i saw him in the book hard exterior but weak inside loved cat with neds bones can someone please reward michelle fairley for her portrayal in both series she made me cry when jon was saying goodbye to bran last year and she did it again tonight when she saw neds bones sansas humiliation scene  sophie nailed it when she walked out and spat her usual line about her beloved joffrey birth of baby stan  hugs to the cgi department again and im sorry to say but yes i loved the bleak scenes at harrenhal because they helped show the danger arya and gendry are in didnt mind the prostitutes it could probably have been cut down a little but i did also notice that this was a mirror imageparody  even  of the scene last year when littlefinger was instructing ros and her friend and it showed that joffrey is trying to take on his uncle tyrion not sure about qarth beautiful cgi again but daxos was a wee bit less oily than i see him in the book i really do think it was poorly directed that scene everyone just stood about as if on a stage introduction of the woman we all know as jw i think i know where theyre going here because its always been my theory that she was a lannister plant in the first place but i seem to remember that grey wind wouldnt go near jw and her family  he was very unhappy about them im really not sure what this new twist is going to be here  i assume they all want us to accept this volantine lass as a love interest hence they didnt show us grey wind reacting to her hmm i havent quite gathered my thoughts about this yet finally roose bolton ive decided i am now one twisted effedup girl because that voice just made me melt hes a superb piece of casting but i wonder if hes going to double as ramsay too"
"Ghost of Crackclaw",2012-04-23,"i cant give this more than a 7 even though peter dinklage is ragingly awesome as ever the dialogue in front of the gates of qarth was abominable charles dance is excellent as well but the harrenhal thing is just too compressed i freely admit that i despise aidan gillians approach to littlefinger tooi cant give it a 6 because omgshadowbaby but so much of this episode felt mechanical and stilted 7"

"Davos55",2012-04-23,"i think last weeks episode was better but this was still great and sets up things well for the rest of the season i think episode 5 and beyond will really step the intensity up i would like to see some more fighting though but i suppose they are saving that for blackwater which will be amazing one thing i wonder is will they ever reveal the other kingsguard members i mean meryn trant is important but what about balon swann oakheart and of course mandon moore right now besides meryn sandor and jaime the rest of the kingsguard is just nameless soldiers with cool armor and white cloacks i just love the kingsguard in general and wish it was more developed"
"mafalda",2012-04-23,"i voted a 9 loved harrenhal it was just as creepy an eerie as described in the book and the actor who plays tywin scares the crap out of me i liked when he complimented arya for her sense though and the tickler was very impressive also the parts where arya is sleeping in the rain and reciting her hit list that was acting at its finest tyrion and lancel were hilarious an annointed knight lol seeing robb on the battlefield was cool too hes one character that does not have a pov in the book that i actually like following im not too sure about the girl who is supposed to be jeyne westerling she looks and acts a lot differently than i expected stannis and renly were hilarious it sucks that renly has to die so soon he seems like such an amiable guy i wasnt aware he was a ham the look on mels face i totally missed the roose bolton part where was he my complaints are few what the hell happened to the mountain can we just call him the hill i dont know why hbo didnt choose to renew their contract with season 1 mountain but he was perfect and this guy is just scrawny and his voice sounds like a 12 year old not huge and imposing at all i am praying they go back to season 1 mountain for the fight with the red viper my other complaint was the absolutely unnecessary joffrey and the prostitutes scene does hbo really think of its viewers as so dumb that once this scene was played everyone would just now realize for the first time that joffrey is a sick little bastard it was just a stupid excuse to show nudity and im certainly no prude but i can do without all the prostitute scenes it was just gross and weird i also wanted the hound to be involved in trying to stop sansas beatings great episode overall bring back the real mountain that rides"

"Grail King",2012-04-23,"85 i liked the grey wolf scene and though a lot of people hated the joff and ros scene it was a hit in my house as my wife who doesnt read the books really loathed the little shit so it made its point  could have been a bit shorter the tyrion joffery and sansa scene was great with all actors hitting their marks i especially liked when sansa left the throne room with her stark mask on and tyrions line of lady stark you just may survive us after all bronn was golden i liked the throw back from catlyn to lf im a little mixed on the robb jeyne run in and i didnt like the newer mountain actor and i thought aryas eyes for the dead people was very good i liked the shadow baby scene except the you want me part to davos that scene along with the joff scene had my wife saying wtf fairly loudly i was a wee disappointed in the stannis and renly scene and if they would have shorten the ros scene a bit they may have been able to buy a peach"
"TeamDanyArya",2012-04-23,"i gave it a 6 for some reason the episode wasnt clicking with me maybe when i rewatch it ill change my mind but that easily was my least favorite out of the 4 this season and maybe so far i didnt like robbs scene with whoever that was i had seen somewhere they had changed jeyne westerlings name and that she was going to be introduced in this episode so i hope that wasnt her i dont like her at all im on the fence about the joffery and the whores scene that would make sense when we get introduced to ramsay bolton but joffery it seems too forced all the others were just meh to me although margareys and lfs scene was really good i wish danys scene had been a bit longer and we had gotten some explanation about the other people that made up the 13 i think for a casual viewer it might have left them scracthing their head like someone else mentioned the episode was too short it was only about 50 minutes not counting the bs ad for hbo go at the beginning and the filler at the end a few more minutes with dany and robb might have been better edited by teamdanyarya 23 april 2012  1013 pm"

"packersfan",2012-04-23,"again the danaerys scenes were just slow and dull though it is nice to get a visual for what we are dealing with in the east enjoyed getting a glimpsed of harrenhal disappointed with the combination of the stories of melisandre birthing the shadow in the books she and davos dont smuggle until they get to storms end and need to break into that fortress i really think they should have stuck with the book on this and had renly just killed by a shadow out of the blue and leave everyone wondering what just happened like we all did when reading the bookthen have the revealing scene with davos and melisandre just like in the book amazing how martin in the books revealed things in a much more interesting and cinematic way than these directors and writers of the show laying everything out there so that the idiot viewers dont have any mystery i rated the show a 6i gave last weeks the best so far  an 8 i think this episode continued to move forward included many great things from the book but dragged in places where they show writers insisted on introducing their own material joffrey torturing prostitutes robb receiving an antiwar diatribe from a fieldnurse neither scene was necessary everyone who has read the books or watched the shows knows that joff is a royal prick monster and everyone knows that war hurts the innocent and those who have no real stake in the whole matter again why this scene wasting time on things like this forces the show to combine acts like moving the davos and melisandre scene to before renlys death in the show it makes no sense where is davos smuggling her into why do they need to go to a secret passage renlys camp is in the open it seems like they actually filmed and wrote the scene intending them to be breaking into storms end but then in editing stuck it before renlys death which i am assuming is going to be in ep 5 unless they scrap it and confuse viewers completely i just will never understand the need on the part of directors and screenwriters to rewrite excellent source material"

"Dragon of Valyria",2012-04-24,"my score 3 for the changes to the title sequence this season has been better about adding new locations although i wish they would have at least added storms end even if we didnt see the castle itself the sweeping pan over essos over the armillary sphereastrolab sun was awesome 1 for robbs battle scene 1 for fart jokes and inanity 0 for the volantis girl holding my view on that until i see how they decide to play the romance 9 for the sansajoffreytyrion scene i was dreaded that scene for the last few episodes since i dont watch previews it finally happened and i could barely watch it even though her beating was briefer than it was in the book most of the points here are for turners fantastic acting tyrions snappy lines and the poignancy of him helping her up her grateful look at someone treating her decently and her incredibly graceful and powerful departure with her head held up in case the score didnt make it clear i loved the resolution of that scene 5 for the joffreywhores scene i didnt think it was too much i just think it completely undermined the important scene just before it and its mostly what people are going to be talking about aside from the ending of this episode i feel like im wondering whether its ros the prostitute whos a main character or if its sansa stark given the relative importance the two seem to be getting  1 for harrenhal looked fantastically haunted 1 for not having room inside the largest keep on westeros  1 for tywins awesome scene as implausible as it might have been he had great lines shes a girl you idiot great delivery too 2 for qarth itself the cg looked like a mix between babylon and constantinople very lush and opulent approve 2 for stannisrenly no buildup at all and despite the hes a ham line a lot of the charm was lost 1 for shadowbaby this was difficult i loved it and hated it i liked the bit with the latern flare and davos being horrified but i didnt like the smoke monster from lost one bit an evil peter pan shadow would have been less cheap looking and far more terrifying i think they could have even shown mels sihouette giving birth to it and then pulled back to her showing her as a person but the shadow still there by my count that leaves us at 7 so 7 it is pretty good episode if hamstrung by some problems my second favorite of the season though all told"

"summer_stark",2012-04-24,"1 for not having room inside the largest keep on westeros laughpng classbbcemoticon altlaugh  that made me laugh out loudliterally so true but i totally didnt notice it until you said itoverall id give this a 75 it was good but i liked last week better and i have a terrible memory so most of my gripes arent based on a comparison to the bookand for the record i friggin love this showim obsessed i watch each episode at least 3 times which is probably why i notice some of the gripes i have also i thought the first 4 episodes of season 1 were fairly slow as welland it was really episode 5 where it got awesomeso i think things will improve a lot starting next weekill start with the things i disliked1 the fart jokeare you friggin kidding me i literally cringed and thought about how all the people ive introduced the show to would be rolling their eyes at yet another fart joke as if the previous one wasnt bad enough plus the wholegotcha oh wait we really are going to die thing is so overplayed it definitely irritated methey couldve just had the guy get up and say do you hear somethaaahh gets eaten by grey wind2 qarth the scene was so randomthe whole scene felt inauthentic is really what my beef is too cheesy fantasy movie for my tastes the spice king reminded me of jabba the hut but with the demeanor of i cant even think of whobut just lamethe entire time i was thinking why dont they just take her dragons is she seriously yelling at them i mean i thought it was ok to show her desperation bla blabut if she was so desperate wouldnt she just show her dragons i mean theyre pretty obviously in the pier 1 baskets so it just seemed weird obviously it also shows that shes got the crazy targ streak but still felt forced plus the whole invoking sumai thingwow how cliche some parts of the qarth thing were okthe horde line the look inside pyat pree in the background and honestly i didnt even remember how the whole qarth scene happened in the book so this is just based on my tv viewing not book comparison3 shadowbaby not all badbut the fact that most non book readers think its a smoke monsterbecause thats what it looked likebugs me and i know some people are saying thats how it was written but i disagreenowhere in the scene does it say that it comes out amidst smoke and then formsit says the hands wrap around and the head comes out and it comes out and then gets huge ie the size of a large shadownot that it is vaguely formed and smokey then takes human formalso i thought davos initial reaction was sort of comicalhe didnt look very scaredpoorly actedthough i usually think he is greatthat face he made took me out of the moment for a second but knowing what it was i have to say i thought it turned out pretty goodmostly i just hate that it was made in such a way that it legitimately is called the smoke monster from lost or a dementor4 the mountaini know the other dude left to play the hobbit but this is the scariest big guy you could find he made a face that was like a genial smile at one pointwhich made him seem like a giant teddy bear5 the moment ser meryn is about to hit sansa for the last time and tyrion stops himit felt like the actor playing ser meryn was going to stop or even did just before tyrion said anythinglike the timing seemed off so when he raised his sword i thought it was comical again taking me out of the moment tyrion more than made up for it though6 fading to black for what seemed like 5 minutes during the battle7 lfthe whole making a play felt poorly acted and ill timed not in the sense of her being a widow that too but in the sense of the actors playing off of each other8 did anyone else think the shot of davos and mel in the boat after the long shot where they are rowing into the cave was disconcerting he was rowing but not moving at allwas that supposed to happencouldnt they have made him move a little part of the problem is probably that i watched the episode 35 times so i noticed all the random things but even the first time i watched it i remember thinking why are you rowing if youre not going anywhere9 the musicit felt off for some reasonlike it was too modern at certain momentslikes1 tyrionsansabronn scene i thought it was awesome period2 tyrionlancelhilarious and i thought eugene simon lancel did a great job3 the joffros sceneit was disturbing as fuck but i thought it was very well doneand i think that nonbook people get a real sense of the psychopathsadist that joffrey is that they didnt seem to get before so i was fine with this addition though it couldve been shorter4 harrenhalfrom arya saying dead people to hot pie peeing himself when the guy he is taking after who said he never gets picked bc he stares at the mtn so hot pie stares at the mtn gets picked to rat torture and tywin being superbi loved it arya and her storyline even the truncated version is one of my very favorites a little worried about how the tywin cupbearer thing will play out in terms of the jaqen storyline5 the stannisrenl parley i loved this scene i thought it renly was hilarious and stannis perfectly rigid i dont see the point of the peach in this context because the peachs ongoing significance is all in stannis inner monologue so we couldnt get that on the tv show anyway6 margaeryi adore the tv version of her characterthough i hope her grandma

"packersfan",2012-04-24,"my friend and i were just discussing how we almost wish we had not read the books first i hadnt read the books before watch season 1 and i just loved it and it got me into reading the books now season 2 rolls around and i am seeing where hbo is making deviations and adding and changing scenes and at some points they just seem unnecessary the two scenes that struck me as wasting time in this episode that could have been better spent developing and telling more of the actual book story were joff and the prostitutes robb and the field nurse both seemed unnecessary to me first neither happened in the books that is not to say they could not have happened since neither robb nor joff were pov characters in the book second what was the need again hbo is acting like a horny teenager and must have ta onscreen wasting time we know prostitutes are prostitutes and we know joff is a cunt did we really need an even more sadistic scene than him having sansa beaten and stripped as for robb and this field nurse i really hope she disappears and doesnt ruin the actual plot of robb falling for jeyne westerling again this scene just added little in the way of plot besides throwing out the ageold argument against war that the little guy pays the price for the big guys fights the fact that the show has to pick and choose which characters to even show a glimpse of in each episode begs the question why they waste time on additional scenes that do nothing to further explain a characters inner thoughts and motivations i am fine with hbo expanding on some things that we did not see in the books like renly and loras relationship since the pov characters were not able to be watching that but these writers are having a little bit of a problem weighing which expansion is necessary and actually useful showing me again that joffrey is a dick is redundant especially when you had to write a new original scene to do it showing me that robb is in a little over his head and really is still very young is not entirely necessary though it might be the better of the two especially when you need to write a new scene to convey it comon we have a whole plot line coming up where we find out that robb is not completely grounded by duty as a king"

"gogorath",2012-04-27,"i am probably more critical of films and tv than most people are i would say shows like sopranos twin peaks and the wire blow away the writing that weve seen so far from the hbo got other shows that arent dramas  seinfeld the office bbc version i dont think there are very many really good tv shows but that doesnt magically make the writing on the got adaptation better just because there arent a lot of other really well written tv shows out therei already posted this last year but i think my expectations were simply too high after i saw that hbo was adapting the show and one of the writers actually said something along the lines of envisioning the show like a medieval sopranos which is exactly how i view the books to a certain extent but the writing isnt even in the same ballpark as the sopranos and its not like the writers dont have source material to draw from i understand time and budget constraints but thats not really the problem imo the writing is simply lacking in subtly its middle of the road overly safe characterization is lacking in places dialogue pales in comparison to the dialogue from the book its like the writers or hbo are trying to adapt the books more to how other modern shows because they are afraid the show wont be well received otherwise which sucks imoas far as critics raving about it im not saying the show is bad not at all but its pretty irrelevant to me that critics think the show is better than most shows on tv when most shows on tv are mediocre at best what is so great about the actual writing on the show i dont get itand no i am not a terrence malick fan lol thin red line was horrible and pretentious although some of his shots and direction are interesting and cool i guessthanks for taking my post as it was intended  an honest question malick is an acquired taste i can understand not liking him but i thought thin red line was fantastic my point about the critics is this if you divide up people who love the show and the writing in particular on one side you have professional tv critics and a vast majority of the nonbookreading watchers as well as at least half of the bookreaders though i have nothing scientific on the last point on the side of people who think the writing is poor weve got a significant portion of book readers and of the people who think the writing is poor its almost all book readers so heres my hypothesis the primary driver of discontent with the writing is comparison to the source materiali cant ever prove but all the evidence points me there you list quality shows as better the wire the sopranos and twin peaks i assume you mean the first season before it all sort of fell apart i put the wire above all but the sopranos it had its struggles in terms of continuity and flow and twin peaks lasted like a season and a half i love deadwood and rome but the latter had slow parts you need to finish season one to fall in love and thenaccelerated and in former the second season felt aimless at timesbut you know what all of those have in common aside from the general historic outline of rome no published source material theres nothing for hypercritical people to latch onto this is why i asked for a better adaptationthe writers have tried to keep the tv show as faithful to the book as possible anyone else would have cut 23 of the characters and half of the storylines the result is something complex that is sometimes tough to handle all the flow and exposition but theyve done a great job the sopranos didnt have six or seven families to fight with and david chase didnt have to deal with people bitching about the choice of fruit or that andrea wasnt hot enough or that they changed carmelas character too much or that theyve marginalized silvioas for your particular complaints i do think there is time things have been overly explicit part of that is dealing with complexity in a short time span some of it is watchers just not getting it littlefingers discussion with margaery  where she basically says i care about being the queen not about renly  was subtle and half the book readers are bitching about it being unnecessary sansas scene with cersei and shae two episodes ago was brilliantly subtle and again people complained because they saw a deviation not a subtletyi think theres plenty of fantastic writing and directing its not perfect and never will be but having a reference point of expectations makes any deviation noticeable the nonbook readers dont seem to have this issuewhen any of my nonbook reading friends  and ive talked over ten of my friends and family into watching  start to complain about the writing ill start to chalk up the complaints as legitimate but i the genesis of most complaints is comparison and expectationsas an aside scenes written mostly by the writers from the last two eps that ive loved the writingall the new greyjoy scenes especially theon confronting his fatherall the margaery scenes  especially in the bedroom with renly just awesomei really liked the writing with davos and stannis on the boat and the shadowbaby scenei didnt like all the dialog but i loved jeynes questioning of

"Caro99",2012-04-22,"wow didnt see talisa nor volantis coming into the story i had my misgivings about oona playing jeyne since i thought she was going to play a westerling minor root of the lannisters though i had already resigned myself to have her being bold and not afraid to open her mind unlike thejeyne from the books but after watching oona i must say that i regret what i said above i did like the thing going on between her and robb  i liked that she is from volantis she is not the jeyne from the books so i wont judge her by those standards but being from volantis does make me wonder about some things spoiler she seems to be alone so if her mother isnt with her how will robb and talisa fail to produce an heir if the show changes this and they do end up with an heir im still not sure what to make of it and the first thing i thought when she said volantis was of one of the sand snakes i remember shae being thought of as one of oberyns daughters but that isnt happening anymore and i hope that talisa isnt one either but it was clever of them to have her being from volantis when in the books we dont really get to know anyone from there apart from the red priest on vicatarions ship and the innkeeper of the place where jorah and tyrion sleep so but i think that jeyne is highborn so cant wait to see what they make of her background they have a clean slate to do so i guess but it will be heartwrenching to see the rw even more now that well have robb grow up and fall in love"
"Dragon of Valyria",2012-04-22,"the second i saw robb glance at her i figured she had to be jeyne the show couldnt focus on some random aid person like that the length of the scene underlined that i also think the whole bit about being from volantis is a lie"

"Fengari",2012-04-27,"that the name is changed doesnt really bother me much when i saw it i though it was just another yaraasha move to avoid confusion with jeyne poole the last name and the background isnt that important to me either what is most important is that robb will be breaking the marriage pact with the freys who he does that with and the whole story behind her family though an interesting aspect of the books is not that important for the events that follow what bothers me a bit more is how different this talisa is from jeyne as a character in the books i understood robb falling for jeyne while she was nursing him because she is depicted as a nice sweet loving person and i felt that meeting someone like that must have been real nice for robb after all that had happened to him after all he had a happy protected childhood as the heir of a lord and all of a sudden his brother has a severe accident and is then is attacked in his own home his father captured and later murdered his sisters are held hostage as far as he knows and he has to grow up really fast to wage a war because his family and their bannermen expect him to after all its them that proclaim him king of the north that was not his choice which is by the way what i felt the whole conversation with talisa was trying to convey that he doesnt wage this war because he likes it or out of ambition but just because it is what he has to do to me choosing to marry jeyne was not just about him doing the honourable thing after a moment of weakness it was about him choosing jeyne because she was actually the one thing in his life that made him happy and could make him forget all that trouble for a while it made the decision not less foolish but understandable with talisa i cannot see the same thing if she will be the one to nurse him when he gets injured it would be very strange for the person we saw on that battlefield to start pampering him and being nice and sweet to him all of a sudden it could be hes not going to be injured and the relationship will be more about his admiration for a strong woman who doesnt cringe when sawing off someones leg and who is not afraid to speak her mind to a king but that is a serious deviation in character from the books and one i feel makes it less understandable why he would break the marriage pact im not judging yet im interested to see how this develops but im a bit apprehensive about it"

"Rohanne",2012-04-23,"i guess the question i still have is why not show the intensity of sansas beating tyrion still rescued her from possibly more beating in the book that scene would have had more weight if they would have shown it like it was in the book of course they wouldnt have had to show her topless but kept her in her corset like they did"
"Scooby",2012-04-23,"although i thought the whore scene was very unnecessary to some degree it had a point joff is king a king can do what he likes and he is showing his uncle this by doing whatever he feels like doing this uncle humiliated him in court joff couldnt let that stand from a character building point of view i get why they did it i agree i think the main focus of the scene is being lost i did not view it as overtly sexual but more a message joff was sending to tyrion as evidenced by the whore saying she would go tell tyrion what he had done and he said she better or he would hurt her too there is an underlying theme in the books of joff is the mad king come again however it would seem that this is more punishment for tyrion interupting joffs fun at court than anything else"
"Lady Octarina",2012-04-23,"my only problem with the scene was that it took time from things i would rather have watched for longer stannis for instance and yes i too had hoped he would rid us of ros once and for all also i dont understand what was the purpose of that if they didnt show tyrions reaction to what joffrey had done  or will that happen next episode well when we read the books its not hard to figure out the kind of sadistic brat joffrey is but on screen and most of all on hbo they have to exaggerate those things its inevitable and the obvious parallels with aerys are necessary too might help explain why tyrion and jaime wont be sorry to see him dead for one thing i only wish they would put more emphasis in his relationship with cersei in cersei refusing to see the kind of monster her son became oh and his cruelty will only make us love tommen even more when the time for that comes and nothing is more legitimate than that"

"Giskard Reventlov",2012-04-23,"i didnt see any reason for that scene even the nonreaders are by now well aware that geoffrey is a psycho and sociopath and one more scene like this doesnt tell us anything new only reason for that scene is to add a little more sex and believe me i dont have anything against sex scenes au contraire as del boy would say smilepng classbbcemoticon alt   books are full of them but  with adding the sex scenes that are not in the books we lose valuable time that could have been used to see on the screen some part of the book that was left out and in the prcess we dont see and learn anything newi meanwe see that geoffry is mad and littlefinger is sociopath that cares only for himself in the other episodelike no one knew that edited by giscard reventlov 23 april 2012  0121 pm"

"kirazikins",2012-04-23,"i think this scene has a larger purpose than just emphasizing how cruel joffery is this scene makes it seem like joffery is also a sexual sadist we know that the queen of thrones will orchestrate jofferys death i think in the show it will be margaery and this scene will be part of her motivation  she wouldnt want to marry a sexual sadist joffery seems to only be cruel to those who are weaker than him his subjects and who he hates  margaery as his wife probably wouldnt need fear him but if joffery is a sexual sadist  she would not be able to escape his cruelty in the bedroom also we know that littlefinger is apart of this orchestration ros will tell lf what happened and lf will tell margaery both of them will scheme to murder joffery allowing margaery to marry super nice and young tommen"

"CrypticWeirwood",2012-04-23,"let me ask you this what book series have you read clearly not the same one as i have why do people keep saying this awful thing itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s incredibly demeaning a personal ad hominem insult that has no business here i even seem to recall there was some moderator warning about it in another thread why must people inevitably descend into the same petty namecalling and insultsoh right because this is the internet great excuse that"
"The Meeraculous Third Reed",2012-04-23,"im very very surprised that people are getting worked up about this can someone please explain to me how joffrey getting one whore to hit another one is any worse than having sansa beaten at regular intervals or intending to strip her naked before the royal court or forcing her to look upon the head of her dead fatherperhaps the scene was a little long but this was tempered for me by the fantastic acting of jack gleeson its just a shame we shall never have a scene with him alfie allen and tyrion all in the same room"
"The Second Hand",2012-04-23,"i have no objection to the scene itself martins world is probably even more viscious my problem is that it didnt serve the story it was just there and almost needleesly using ros"
"Syseanne",2012-04-23,"yeah it kind of felt to me that they could not do to sansa what the book does due to the actress being so young and therefore needed some whores to bring that point across and i did not hate the scene i do think it shows some brilliant acting joffrey is in the books as well a cruel and twisted man or boy he is older in the series so i do understand that his fetish is probably even more developed than in the books or he is more so able to live out all of the evil inside however id just rather have seen more sansa beating and that came out wrong sansa next to theon just is kind of my favorite storyline in acok and i feel like it is being barely mentioned i was really looking forward to seeing the melonmorningstar scene and it kind of felt that the whores scene took it from me although as i said before you probably cant film such a scene with a 16 years old actress"
"Tadco26",2012-04-23,"the scene itself was reasonably well acted plausable that joffrey would do such a thing and plausable that tyrion would arrange it the problem is that including tyrions discussion with bronn and all the set up it was a extremely long scene in an adapatation of a book that already is starved for time and has to cut so many lines of dialogue and action because of that lack of time if there were 20 episodes this season the scene wouldnt bother me but with only 10 and so many other story lines feeling like cliff note versions i fail to see why this scene was more important to show than scenes that were cut from the source material the time could have been spent on renlys peach and stannis brandishing light bringer for the first time or stannis and davos fully explaining the backstory of the onion knight so that the rotten onion comment later had more connection or even allowed for arya to escape ser amory at the end of last episode and get recaptured by the mountains men this episode there are so many scenes that have to be cut or drastically reduced due to time that this scene should have been cut not because it was bad per se or even untrue to the characters but because there are more important and interesting scenes that could have been included instead it was extremely wasteful screen time wise in relation to what it did to further the story along edited by tadco26 23 april 2012  0257 pm"

"Rohanne",2012-04-23,"i understand if the directors did not want to go too far with sansa seeing how sophie is only 16 i also do not feel joffrey was out of character with the following scene but wasnt convinced it was necessary i know what is in the books though so hard to know what a nonreader needs to be shown in order to get the same effect"
"The Knight of Grasses",2012-04-23,"tvfilm and books are two very different media maybe im unique but i find it much less graphic to read about these things than to see them i dont know what kind of reader or viewer that makes me it just is my problem with the scene is that it was needlessly graphic the story would have been better served if sansa had received more abuse not necessarily being stripped nude at joffreys behest and the whore scene left out entirely joffrey could have taken out his displeasure over tyrions interference in one of any number of ways the book had as many pages as grrm wanted to tell his story he could have made them even longer if he wanted the tv show has a very limited window to tell the story and develop characters this scene was a waste of time in my opinion"
"Blangadanger",2012-04-23,"im sorry but i didnt see this scene as sexual deviance joffrey clearly hates tyrions gift and wants to show his uncle that he holds more power than him i did not feel that joffrey was enjoying the beating in a sexual way he simply wanted to humiliate the prostitutes and his uncle thats the sole reason for this scene not to make you hate him because the audience certainly does already i think its also important to note that we never actually see any of the beatings it takes place in our imaginations from the sounds we hear that being said the scene was at the line if not over it in its depiction of violence i do think a reaction towards tyrion was necessary especially since hes much older in the show than in the book but could they have shown a different scene to get the same point across yes"

"Dragon of Valyria",2012-04-23,"oh yes i understand you but i think two more blows would make the scene must stronger in the book she was quite hurt afterwards and could barely walk oh well cant wait to see more of sansa she and arya are by far my favourite characters i just cant wait to see the remaining starks reunite somedayi think it would have been perfectly strong enough it was quite a well done scene if it werent immediately followed up by something that most members of the audience feel like is far worse of an abuse of power i dont really have a problem with how vile joffreys prostitute scene was i have a problem with it existing at all"
"Tadco26",2012-04-23,"and seeing the producers are looking at this as a season by season project instead of the bigger picture we see as book readers they need to set up joffrey as this larger then life psycho so his dead will be extremely satisfying for the viewersdo they really need to though most viewers already hate joffrey and he has plenty of scenes directly from the book that illustrate what type of person he is between now and his death more importantly do they need to show this scene over showing stannis brandish light bringer and renly with his peach or davos and stannis explaining exactly how davos became the onion knight or arya wandering with her pack of gendry hot pie and lommy after escaping ser amory only to get caught by the mountains men there are so many scenes from the book that have to be cut or drastically reduced due to time so it is pretty difficult for me to accept that this scene was needed when so many better scenes have to be cut or turned into cliff note versions of the original"
"Narayan",2012-04-23,"do they really need to though most viewers already hate joffrey and he has plenty of scenes directly from the book that illustrate what type of person he is between now and his death more importantly do they need to show this scene over showing stannis brandish light bringer and renly with his peach or davos and stannis explaining exactly how davos became the onion knight or arya wandering with her pack of gendry hot pie and lommy after escaping ser amory only to get caught by the mountains men there are so many scenes from the book that have to be cut or drastically reduced due to time so it is pretty difficult for me to accept that this scene was needed when so many better scenes have to be cut or turned into cliff note versions of the originalaside from renly who isnt even that important in the book there will be plenty of time to show stannis brandishing lightbringer and letting us get to know these other characters better in the following seasons and episodes would i have liked seeing some of the stuff you mention you bet but i can understand why its been left out or will be expanded on later"
"Travy1991",2012-04-23,"i am not sure sophie does topless stuffmissed the hounds reaction tho he is the one who puts his cloak over hernow wasnt it tyrion in the novel who stopped all that nonsensei doubt sophie is allowed to do topless stuff as she is only 1516 years old"
"ShadowRaven",2012-04-23,"this is a tv adaption many nonbook readers dont know the extent of joffreys craziness so the tv producers want to display what a character he is"
"teemo",2012-04-23,"well ive been thinking about this and you also have to consider that joffrey is somewhat of a fan favorite not like viewers love him but love to hate on him anyone i talk to about the show just cant get over what a little shit he is maybe the writers think hey we can get some ta in one scene while showing how crazy joffrey is people will love that thats not what i personally love but i guess i can see where theyre coming fromi would have honestly preferred an extended scene with sansa they could have shown dontos and the watermelon and how joffrey wasnt pleased with that amount of humiliation and wanted more we could have heard more punching sounds from meryn and sansas screaming not that i like to sansa get beat up shes one of my favorite characters but it would have been more true to the book and that stupid drawnout whore scene could have been chopped and honestly if theyre going to do the whore scene go further with it have joffrey kill ros with a crossbow and send her head to tyrion then we kill one bird with two stones  ros is dead and joff is more horrific than ever"
"LordMarani",2012-04-23,"id say the sansa beating was cut back both to spare the viewers the sight and to make tyrion arrive just in time not too late afterwards they probably felt that tyrion educating joffrey without any consequences for the rest of the episode didnt work it would look like tyrion had control over joffrey and was keeping him in line so the whore scene was added to clearly show what would have happened to sansa without intervention and to show that joffrey is still out of control and sending tyrion a message the only thing i felt was really missing was cleganes protest even if sansa wasnt that badly beaten at all  iirc he was even smiling which would be totally out of character i felt sorry for the actor playing joffrey they really tested his limits theres only so many scenes you can stomach playing the crazy sadist in increasingly disturbing scenes"
"DannySpud",2012-04-23,"this was my favourite scene in the episode there was never going to be as much detail in the show as there was in the books so the important things need to get stressed joff needed a doucheboost this season hes been a dick this season but in ways that you can kind of see his reasoning having the whore scene on top of the sansa stripping scene completely hammers home how much of a creep joff is when it comes to the purple wedding in season 34 the audience has to be completely 100 aware that this guy is a complete arsewipe"
"Tadco26",2012-04-23,"aside from renly who isnt even that important in the book there will be plenty of time to show stannis brandishing lightbringer and letting us get to know these other characters better in the following seasons and episodes would i have liked seeing some of the stuff you mention you bet but i can understand why its been left out or will be expanded on laterthere will be plenty of time to show joffrey as well the scene would have been perfect in an extended directors cut dvd but it was one of if not the longest scene in the entire show counting tyrion and bronns discussion prior and the hound and joffrey before joffrey goes in the room game of thrones just doesnt really need filler scenes when there is so much brilliant book content to cover that they cant possibly get to it all even if they didnt feel the need to make up completely original scenes not related to book content"
"Dornish",2012-04-23,"regardless of how far it went the scene was needlessly redundant and theres no chance they couldnt have done something better with the time we know joffs a monster they literally had him kill babies in the first episode and the scene immediately preceding the one in question reestablished his status as biggest shit in the known universe"

"Hyper",2012-04-23,"id say the sansa beating was cut back both to spare the viewers the sight and to make tyrion arrive just in time not too lateafterwards they probably felt that tyrion educating joffrey without any consequences for the rest of the episode didnt work it would look like tyrion had control over joffrey and was keeping him in line so the whore scene was added to clearly show what would have happened to sansa without intervention and to show that joffrey is still out of control and sending tyrion a messagethis 100 agreement"
"Jamie Lannister",2012-04-23,"have joffrey kill ros with a crossbow and send her head to tyrion then we kill one bird with two stones  ros is dead and joff is more horrific than everwhy arent you writing this show"
"Queen Regent",2012-04-23,"maybe this is how they are bringing in the layalas beaten whore cant remember her name to tyrion that was what i thought they were doing when i watched it since they arent using the brothel as tyrions way out to see shae maybe this is how they get to beat a whore"
"arya horsefaceless",2012-04-23,"im with the people who wanted to see more of the sansa being beaten not because i liked her getting beateni hated it it was a very cringe worthy moment in the book that was very important to directly show how badly sansa had it and how the knights of kings landing werent very knightly which makes sandors opinion of knighthood so much more relevant with him sort of sticking up for sansa its meant more to the story that just showing joffery being a sick little cunt of a king it effects the development of other characters"
"Brucolac",2012-04-23,"i dont see why people think him ordering the bastards deaths is worse then him sending someone after bran i dont think the show is ever going to reveal that so i dont have a problem with him getting the blame for the bastardssomething cersei did atleast to a certain extent in the books they just changed the culprits i kind of like the scene in the books where he is trying to shoot rabbits with the crossbow in the gardens and wish they had just kept that instead of him threatening a whore with one while she beats another it was a nice mix of sadistic incompetence"
"towerofjoy",2012-04-23,"perhaps theyre saving the bunny scene for when littlefinger gets back he had a great quip about hoping everyone liked rabbit since the red keep would soon be overrun since joff was such a bad shot i actually think they may have been forced to pull back on the sansa beating not only because of sophies age but also because of the perceived age of her character in the books she starts out as 11 in the show 1314 thats still too young to have anything too risque i dont think this is a us rule but a british one iirc dd and grrm were interviewed about the need to age the children because of this"
"Morvran",2012-04-23,"i have to think that just as theyre establishing joffrey to be even more sadistic and nasty than in the books theyre also giving him a little more in the smarts department hes learning how to play the game of thrones albeit in his own way hes not just running around being a little prickhes also trying to outsmart the other players now if it turns out that was just a random scene to make him seem nastier ill be disappointed"

"Envie",2012-04-23,"also to think that the entire ship and shboodle was necessary to the scene is to misunderstand the importance of the scene i feeli agree with this too there wasnt really any need to strip sansas dress completely down to her waist as was done in the book the idea is to convey that shes being really cruelly abused and humiliated in front of the entire court  and the scene certainly conveyed that without any doubt"
"Leto Atreides",2012-04-23,"that scene was a huge waste of time there are so many things happening in a clash of kings i cant believe the writers wastes 1015 minutes per episode on scenes like that if they really wanted to show for the 101th times that joffrey is cruel they could have made tyrion send a single whore to him and then show us a short scene where she returns to tyrion all bruised and bloody that would have had the same effect in less than 2 minutes"
"Holmes",2012-04-23,"the major flaw with the scene is not joff sending a message to tyrion its tyrion sending the same damn whore from pycelles room to joff after paying her double hes got to know thats its a bad idea actually the whole damn scene is flawed now that i think about it 1 see above 2 hes the king get him some hot whores not chinless ones or 30 yearolds every single woman in sparatcus is hotter than every woman in got time to even the score 3 its kind of a ripoff of the pulp fiction scene where butch is selecting his weapon 4 the purpose of d and ds scene here could have been much better served with him shooting rabbits or even worse kittens seriously id get super irate at joff for crossbowing a kitten way more than roz or the chinless one otoh if their plan was just to make the audience uncomfortable then mission accomplished edited by holmes 23 april 2012  0927 pm"

"Brucolac",2012-04-23,"for me it is just a problem of what you dedice to spend screen time on i think creating a scene with the whores over using the one with rabbits was a poor choice and i do think it was to fill a nudity quota i dont have a problem with that as much as i have a problem with selection and no i didnt want want to see sansa stripped and beaten more severlyi wanted to see joffrey trying to shoot rabbits with a crossbow not only is it cruel it is the wrong tool for the task and he his bad at it which pretty much sums him up perfectly"

"The Second Hand",2012-04-24,"completely agree id like to think that they are saving everything for blackwater but watch just watch blackwater will amount to barely anything while well spend all of our time in church with cersie and sansa wow i need sleep im so grumpy its more my passion for martin though my passion cant you see"

"Catastrophe",2012-04-24,"for all the flak its gotten i actually didnt mind this scene and i usually hate when the show adds in superfluous sex scenes it was extremely disturbing but thats the point it shows just how much of a sadistic little shit joffrey is in the books we got to see joffreys horrific behavior on a daytoday basis in tyrion and sansas chapters but since a tv show cant go into that level of detail it works better to have a few truly horrifying scenes to showcase the depths of his depravity"
"Ser Sweets",2012-04-24,"i actually rather approved of the scenes addition the very fact that half the posters in this thread seem to be disgusted by the addition of the scene prove that it accomplished what it was trying to do to me it also offered another point of justification as to why ros is aroundi dont think it needed to be so long though my imagination would have actually done far worse things with that sceptre if perhaps without the hoohah of crossbow belt and overall elongation of the scene they could have simply had him lay his eyes on the sceptre and given a wicked smirkthe scene was fine it just didnt need to take up so much screen timealso i never stop being impressed by gleesons acting he does such a great job as joffrey  one of the better actors in the show imho"
"Wonder",2012-04-24,"i agree that it is a bit over the top but it underlines a valuable point that joffrey doesnt learn and instead grow increasingly bitter in this case particularly linked to the battle of will he just lost to tyrion in the throne room about sansa"

"BurnedCrow",2012-04-24,"people joffrey does shit like this all the time in the books it was more convenient for him to do it to roz and a whore for budget reasons having live animals on a film shoot or robotic ones is costly and time wasting if they were to try to put his crossbow shots on screen plus it ties in with his enmity towards tyrion in the books there is mention of his frequent desire to watch men fight to the death the frequent beatings of sansa if he will beat his betrothed in broad daylight wtf do you think he is going to do when the door is closed with two whores he is an impulsive little monster who happens to be king of the seven kingdoms"

"voodooqueen126",2012-04-24,"i think the whole roz character is irrelevant and annoying joffreys sadism could easily be shown by having him beat sansa frequently this is not only in keeping with the books but is also relevant it doesnt matter if joffrey sadistically tortures prostitutes because nobody has any way of knowing that except the hound and baelish but the fact that joffrey treated his betrothed and the daughter of lord starka very important political hostage in such a manner is the thing that definitively brings about his own downfall since it is sansas testimony of joffreys evil that clinches the tyrell desire to kill joffrey before he has the oppurtunity to treat margaery like that"
"Tadco26",2012-04-24,"some replies here have mentioned that they need to add more of joffreys evil actions because some of his have been cut from the book but that ignores the fact that lots of stuff has been cut from the book for all the characters so why is this act necessary when so many other things that have been cut are not they already added joffreys unexplained murdering of his what he believes to be bastard stepbrothers and sisters he has already threatened to kill his mother if people dont get the fact that he is evil by the time the sansa scene is over then they arent really watching as for getting back at tyrion for showing him up in court that warrants asking ourselves why tyrion was able to stop him in the court in the first place in the books its by threatening to tell his mother what he is doing which cows him but tv joffrey has already made it plain that he does whatever he likes and has threated to kill cersei so why does tv joffrey allow tyrion to stop the beating just because he has bronn this is a plot hole that opens up from the changes of previous writer created scenes in fact i find it practically impossible to believe that tv joffrey who appears to have the powers of a full king and no respect or curtailing from his mother would let tv tyrion live thru the events of clash and storm of swords all because of simple writing changes that would have taken no longer to play out if they followed the book some how on the show we are supposed to believe that joffrey has no regards for what cersei says but will be curtailed by tyrion"

"Thunderfist",2012-04-25,"my main objection to this scene is that it took time away from what i feel are much more interesting and important issues if the point of the scene was to show that joffrey is cruel sadistic and mad as a hatter there are other ways that this could have been done they could have extended the sansa beating scene a little bit giving the hound a chance to get some lines in they could also have shown joffrey shooting the hungry beggars with his crossbow which would really make the riots in kl when they see myrcella off alot more understandable at this stage in the show we havenât really seen much that indicates that the citizens of kl are hungry frightened and angry"

"Tooker",2012-04-26,"the show is just driving home the points from the book a little harder it was implied that joff was a sociopath he cut out the baby kittens from the cat he tortured sansa physically and emotionally he tried to finish bran which is interesting because it indicates not only does he have no problem killing but that he picked up on why bran had fallen in the first place which is something almost no one ever figured out he didnt seem able to connect with other people he had ned starks head chopped probably just for the opportunity to see blood and gore the guy is not well so since the show has to convey all this fast it seems like they are exaggerating joff but they really arent at all spread out over so many books mixed in with other povs and also never coming from the little sickos own pov its easy to downplay the significance of his being a total crazyass when reading he strangely is like king aerys come again way more than dany though she doesnt seem totally sane i know what you mean about the scene being twisted though he picked up that stick thing and i was really disturbed the show always makes an excuse to have petyrs whores in there too every freaking episode we get it hbo theyre ladies who have sex for money soooo fascinating except jk not really love that they found time for that but not to put jon snow or the nights watch in at all"

"LordMarani",2012-04-26,"first of all i believe the people here didnt ask for a sansa nudity scene the cloth cutting we saw in the scene was enough but they believe the beating by ser meryn should have continued as that would be a lot more painful to watch for the viewersthe showrunners probably thought that it was too much and decided to let joffrey torture the prostitutes instead  while just as vile the women were not childrenalso this may be the start of setting up ros as a replacement for alataya  in a future scene we might see tyrion apologizing to her for what joffrey did cersei picks up on him talking to her falsely believes that she is his whore and not shae and then whips her to hurt him tyrion who feels responsible for dragging ros into the middle of this goes on the offensivehe tried to finish bran which is interesting because it indicates not only does he have no problem killing but that he picked up on why bran had fallen in the first place which is something almost no one ever figured outin the books joffrey never knew the truth about cersei and jaime he believed robert baratheon to be his father and even provoked tywin in sos saying how robert won all the battles while tywin was hiding under casterly rockhe sent the cutthroat after bran because he heard robert talking about it being merciless to allow the kid to live and that they should just end his suffering joffrey picked up on this and tried to fulfill roberts wish to impress him not because he had any connection to bran i also really believe that joffrey was a sociopath ie simply incapable of feeling any empathy for others  him cutting up the cat and torturing tommen are strong indicators  and just wanted to please his father and be a merciless and respected ruler like he believed robert baratheon was inflicting pain on others is the only thing he knew to have any effect he was a tragic character and died as an immature kidin the shows they seem to flesh this out a lot probably because the actor plays the role that convincing edited by lordmarani 26 april 2012  0200 pm"
"Woman of War",2012-04-26,"the joffrey actor is just great close to dinklage and charles dance and here joffrey is shown as being fifteen he cannot be older otherwise cersei would not be queen regent anymore so he must be aware of the rumours about his father anything else would be rather unbelievable and the series have so much more possibilites to show the older juvenile as sociopath compared to a younger boy joffrey is of a calculated creepy cruelty that is performance at its best"

"Neffaria",2012-04-26,"i think it would be considered child porn in some countries since sophie is under 18it was not needed to show nudity they made the knight rip the dress on the back and she still kept it over her breast and it was horrible enough that is actually exactly how i imagined the scene would be handled i think it would be considered child porn in some countries since sophie is under 18 just want to clarify somthing i dont think extra nudity would have solved the dilema it definately would be considered child porn in some counries as a matter of fact thats why the gown was ripped from the back because even if they had cleverly ripped the gown from the front and not shown anything it still would be considered child porn in some countries as actors under the age of eighteen cant even be suggested to be nudei feel that the joff and his postitutes establish that he is far more depraved than previously imagined however i too would have prefered the original scene and for me the most important aspect of the original scene was the melon beating given by dontos where everyone at court was laughing at her except joff the humiliation in that moment is palpable where sansa and the reader are willing him to be satisfied a couple of nervous glances by the hound between her and the king followed by the beating and the enough line by sandor followed by the dress being torn even in the back like they did would have been fine and then enter tyrionthat scene establishes sansas humiliation and fear joffs depravity and the hounds chivalrous naturethe scene as it stands with the added prostitute scene does the same with the exception of the hound infoi personally would have prefered the book scene i can understand given hbos proclivity towards nudity content that they decided to trade one nude scene they couldnt do for one they could not what i would have done as a director but i dont work for hbo i dont see why they needed to change it other than nudity content unless there is going to be ramifications from what joff does to the prostitutes if there is then im ok with the change i dont mind deviating from the story if it serves a purpose"

"hoelk",2012-04-27,"hmm what just came to my mind is that expectable spoiler spoiler maybe killing of leadactor children in tv shows is still a kind of taboo thing so they dont want to leave any doubt that he might be a redeemable human being also the actor is amazing and i would totally support a joffrey spinoff series possibly featuring wil wheaton as his sidekick"
"Lyeder",2012-04-27,"well i thought that the whole scene showed more than the joffreys sadism the hatred he has for his uncle he wants the whores to be hurt because tyrion intervened when he had his fun with sansa also by sending them back to tyrion he makes sure that his uncle will know how cruel he really is and that he is totally unwilling to respect any gift of him so the whole scene becomes a message to his uncle  which is imho quite interesting regarding sos when tyrin gets accused of killing joffrey if their mutual dislike is know to court longtime beforehand it is quite understandable why everybody would easily believe tyrions guilt"
"Ser Tom Tarly",2012-04-30,"i thought this scene was deeply disturbing it really shows joffrey for what he is and allows nonreaders to see how evil he is sending the women back to his uncle will only deepen the animosity between them you could see there was no love lost in season one i think it will escalate nicely for next season and a certain wedding"

"rustypaladin",2013-03-13,"i am going to agree with the original poster this scene was disturbing and unnecessary there was so much more they could have added just by leaving out a few of these irrelevant and pointless scenes of course they added more sex its hbo  however this story doesnt need it i generally think that they add sex scenes to sell films and shows with no real plot to hold it afloatdont get me wrong some sex provided it fits snugly into the story is greatbut this was over the top we know joffery is sick and twisted we saw this when he attacked mycah called for neds head commanded that sansa be beaten various times and didnt care at all about his starving people in the city what more do we need its not as if we thought he had a fraction of empathy or kindness to begin with plus we already hate him i do feel however that they are trying to soften cerseis character perhaps they mean to give her some redeeming qualities although im not quite sure why edited by rustypaladin 14 march 2013  0852 pm"

"RSasoiaf",2012-04-28,"i dont know if anyone did speak about this before but again with robbâs storyline  first robb was the one telling is mother to go find renly and try to broke something with him  next episode they try to make robb look like he doesnt know what he is doing and he doesnt have a plan hmmmmhe does have a plan smilepng classbbcemoticon alt  robb wants the north to be independent in order to achieve that he is trying to get the greyjoys on his side he is willing to get some deal with renly because i guess he spots renly as the most likely to let him get away with is king in the north stuffand i dare say that may be the best horse to bet on considering neither jofrey or stannis are keen on having one kingdom less sowhatâs that whole deal about robb now being a child and having no plan you seethey just made him all responsible and mastermind the previous episode when he was the one responsible for sending his mother to renlyâs camp sodoes robb have a plan or not looks to me he has also another thing that doesnt add up is it is not true that robb can just go home and run away from tywin itâs not like they will let him run back home and stay there everything that we have seen previously and everything book readers know from future events clearly says that robb is in a death match with tywin and this will only end when one of them is dead tywin will not spare him even if he is no longer threatening the south tywin will try to get him anyway so robbâs portrayal in episode 4 really doesnt make sense considering everything that has been established thus far and everything that should happen if they want to follow the book"

"Librarian of Lannisport",2012-04-26,"again my apologies for having upset or offended any keepers of board due to my inadequate diligence in looking at threads before posting harimand  i guess part of my concern is that im not really sure how much of the series ship grrm is really running but i imagine well all know in time  if hbo sticks with the series through the bitter end but the use as chatyaalayaya stand in does make sense i just cant get past her northern origins im not sure how i feel about the changes in danaeys storyline im really interested to see how they handle the house of the undying but then i must admit that danaery has never been my favorite chapters of the book to read  i dont really know why except to say that she doesnt seem that much of an inspired leader to me"
"Khal-a-bunga",2012-04-26,"i totally agree that ros is being set up to take the place of alayaya in the show especially after the last episode garden of bones i imagine tyrion will visit ros in the brothels or possibly have her brought to his chambers where one of cerseis spies will witness this and tell her theyre not going to have that scene with joffrey and not have it pay off somewhere down the line and im pretty positive this will be it as far as ros having different origins than the original character  does it really matter"

"Raksha the Demon",2012-04-27,"it could be that ros will flee back to the north and wind up in the dreadfort as ramseys favorite whore so that she can have poignant scenes with reeky theon there without masquerading as arya of course ramsey doesnt have favorite prostitutesconcubines we know what he does to the ones he likes but theyve already changed the story whats one more tweak or they could have ros and theon sub for kyra and theon with the escapehunt occurring much later and have ros either be killed and theon escape or both of them make it to stannis forces  but then why would he put himself out to do anything for a prostitute as i recall stannis is not particularly sensitive to the difficulties faced by prostitutes even prostitutes who have been abused as she would have been to some degree by ramsey they really should have kept jeyne poole with sansa which would have not cost much money she didnt have much dialogue in kings landing more like a lot of crying after the lannister coup poor thing and then she would have been taken away by cersei and littlefinger would have placed her in one of his whorehouses which didnt have to be shown just mentioned where she would have stayed unseen until they needed her to be fakearya edited by raksha the demon 27 april 2012  0508 am"

"Khal-a-bunga",2012-04-27,"its possible though the only resemblance to alayaya would be her being beaten shae is already inside the castle as sansas hand maid and cersei catching tyrion with ros could easily be explained truthfully as him visiting her because he paid her to visit joffrey also it was varys who helped orchestrate tyrions secret get togethers littlefinger owns ros brothel ros taking a beating because cersei believes it will hurt tyrion when ros has no idea why she is being punished is not the same as alayaya knowingly helping tyrion and getting punished for it while protecting tyrion and shaethe alayaya substitution would have made more sense if they had kept tyrion sneaking around to see shae but so far he has already had her in his room in the tower of the hand where he comments how ned slept on this bed to her and despite his comments that he wants to keep her hidden from the queen we have seen no evidence of him sneaking around to see her so far certainly they could rewrite the story so that she is necessary again but why move up shae becoming sansas handmaid instead of sticking closer to the original plot and having tyrion have to sneak thru the brothel secret passages they also have not given any clues to the secret tunnels inside the red keep yet ros has had an awful lot of scenes setting her up if her only resemblance to alayaya is to take a beating from cerseii forgot to mentioned that tyrion would be visiting ros to inquire about what happened with joffrey or something along those lines but cersei wouldnt realize that as you already mentioned ros isnt as complicit as alayaya had been in the novels but again this is an adaptation of the novels so it may play out a bit differently while retaining the same function to the plot if anything i think this makes the most sense both from an economical storytelling standpoint and from how ros has been developed throughout the course of this season a lot of people have mentioned that ros may have gained weight or that she may be pregnant which is why we havent seen her portrayed as she was last season for the most part ie naked im of the thinking that shes kept her clothes on so the audience is more easily able to focus on her as a character and provide a bit more legitimacy when shes taken by cersei or whatever ends up happening ros a jeyne poole on the other hand incredibly stupid no offense meant but it is dumb"

"Ser Sweets",2012-04-24,"really liked the look of the actor they chose and look forward to seeing enough to judge his acting im hoping the volume of his voice was situational because for a strolling war council amidst a bloody battlefield he could hardly have been whispering i hope that when inside and in a more suitable situation his volume is a little more hushed"
"Nebmai",2012-04-24,"i liked the actor so far i pictured roose to be a little older and smaller but the actors demeanor and gaze seem to be perfect he fit the pale eyes bill well enough for film and had a creepy dead stare as he was trying to talk robb into getting some tickler type action going on the prisoners from the reek chapters there was a lot of focus on rooses eyes from theon and i think they got it right here the voice volume being normal makes sense for film as long as they keep it that level of emotionless i think it will have a close enough effect it was a low key introduction but i think that is very fitting and right from the books at first roose really doesnt stand out much from the other bannermen who arent greatjon or walder frey only later on does he start to grow and become a bigger and bigger villainous figure until he is right up there with cersei"

"Ghost from Winterfell",2012-10-08,"my immediate impression of him was somewhat hampered by my own questions about why he was there on the battlefield next to robb nonetheless i do think he fit the role perfectly it did seem to be a very subtle introduction to the character im curious if tvonly viewers really thought much of him at allyes i was bothered about that too but then i remembered that his first appearances in the books are not exactly glorious he was only a creepy bannerman apparently not really invested in the mail conflict by a clash of kings the boltons started their ascend being constantly mentioned until the time he captures harrenhall and then we have a detailed description of the character that practically screams to the reader that this new guy is dangerous and is being set up to play a major rolei think the introduction fit roose very well with him everything is about being subtle and not attracting too much attention i think the viewers will be more surprised that the cool semibackground character will gain such prominence i saw mimes explaining who is who in agot which has lots of characters of course and defining joffrey for example as the worst king stannis as the douche king and theon as the other robb obviously they didnt read the series and probably arent very avid watchers then we get to roose bolton and it simply says who the hell is this guy i was pissed but thats the effect the producers wanted to make imo roose just needs to be a bit unsettling given he is a guy on the good side suggesting his king to kill or torture simple soldiers for information he delivers the common words about his house just to illustrate roose should not scream evil by every pore everything else do it for him his house the flayed man dreadfort so they have to keep it down so he doesnt become a caricature for now he is just a wise right man adviser to robb"

"Sword in the Morning",2012-04-24,"tywin book and show is a selfish utilitarian he plays his game making the optimal use of every piece presented before him seeing right through to any potential use they might have and then taking advantage of it the only exception to this is in the case of tyrion where tywin is so blinded by his own emotions that he cant see the usefulness of his son as far as taking arya as a cupbearer that might be out of character for him i feel that he wants to present an image of prestige and would thus not pick someone off the street to serve as his cupbearer the rest though makes sense he knows that his captives can be put to use around harrenhaltheyre stuck in a giant ruined castle with an army at war theres more work to be done than everyone there combined could accomplish and killing off those extra hands for little gain is foolish"

dominance to the west a household that had fallen into complete disrepute with his fatherâ<U+0080><U+0099>s disastrous command with senior households in open rebellion and inner turmoil in his fatherâ<U+0080><U+0099>s own household tywin lannister took the lion by the reins and catapulted the lannister family to a position of dominance briefly tywin lannister not only was hand to the king for 20 years but was the defacto power behind robert baratheon for another 15 during his time with completely crazy aerys targaryen tywin lead the realm with plenty and prosperityl even ned stark knows that the targaryens left the coffers swimming in gold when the war ended tywin knew how to set things right with robert and made it so his daughter was queen exceptional move btw his grandsons the next king he then kept his family ensconced in power even though he never lifted a finger for robert during the rebellion whats that line again the one about its not the battles you win but the battles you decide not to fight that show how intelligent you arewhen he returned as hand with roberts death tywin immediately defeated robb stark and stannis baratheon not bad at all he then was bringing dorne back into the fold and had secured the loaylty of highgarden copwed the north and brought the roiverlands to heed when tyrion went bitchy and killed him oh well at least it was a lannister who did it being a good hand during peace time seems to me not like that big a dealaccomplishmentfunny ned stark couldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t master that no he never actually won a war if you look closely at the books that is if you do not count the reyne rebellion and the sack of kings landing a warfalse first of all do not minimize the castemere rebellion etc that sort of thing doomed robb after all tywin was not just hand in peace he was hand during the defiance at duskendale and commanded the loyalist forces ultimately sending barristan selmy in to rescue the king and utterly ruining the rebellion tywin was almost certainly a commander in the war of the ninepenny kings he would be of an age with the blackfish and others in that age cohort tywin apparently did not participate as a commander during the greyjoy rebellionwe donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t actually know this for certain its never said in the books and during the war of the five kings he sat at harrenhal and did nothing besides ravaging the surrounding lands and slaughtering the civiliansand then he defeated stannis at kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s landing you neglected that part see part of the reason highgarden did not join stannis was because tywin was lurking out there and highgarden knew that tywin would give a better deal than stannis and also that tywin would ultimately be a worse enemy against stannis than stannis would be an enemy against tywin iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m just saying this because ultimately the tyrells sought tywin out for a reason tywin of course lead the ultimate routing of stannis when it mattered most and when it was most opertunistic when stannis had his jaws burried in the blackwater at that moment tywin knew when to strike and that was that any man would have realized at once that the red wedding would backfire on house lannister eventuallybut it never did ever the lannisters are not suffering because of the red wedding they are suffering because cersei is incompetent and tyrion killed tywin that has zero or â<U+0080><U+009C>little and lessâ<U+0080><U+009D> if i were martin in the red wedding backfiring but while we are on the subject the red wedding was a brilliant masterstroke for tywin he decapitated the north ruined robb and won the war of the five kings all before desert was served that took more than just â<U+0080><U+009C>put a knife in himâ<U+0080><U+009D> tywin had to coordinate two disparate households the westerlings and the freys and get them to coordinate both knew where to go for that a competent man would not have entrusted walder frey with the whole operation but would have sent his own agent to oversee the whole thingwith what magic how would he do this frey did his part the operation succeeded spectacularly i may add the north is again a vassell of the crown and tywinâ<U+0080><U+0099>s own man roose bolton is lodged at winterfell now merely because roose is having problems etc doies not mean that plan did not succeed the plan called for robb to be destroyed he was point tywin as i see tywin  had the reputation of being ruthless and stern and thats why a bunch of people approached him during the war of the five kings ie sybelle and rolph spicer walder frey roose bolton littlefinger etc which in turn enabled him to make use of themit was more than that as i explained above but tywinâ<U+0080><U+0099>s ability to work with people to see goals met was a huge part of his appeal and by the way thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a major problem with another of my favorite characters stannis who routinely does not work with others to make common cause this may be changing the idea is this people know they can make a deal with tywin because a lannister always pays his debts edited by rockroi 24 april 2012  0513

"Lord Varys",2012-04-24,"rockroi yes tywin restored the glory of house lannister but he did not start from scratch in fact technically it was lord tytos who dealt with the reynes and tarbecks since well tytos lannister still was lord of casterly rock when tywin dealt with them we dont know all that much about the details but this was an open rebellion and not some backstabbing thing bolton and frey stabbed robb in the back whereas the reynes and tarbecks were stupid enough to rebel openly against their liege lord but ill still downplay this whole thing tywin did not prove himself to be a great military commander during this war no one ever mentions the great lord tywin even defeated a larger army in the field or something like that he proved to be a man without mercy at a very early age his whole reputation is that of a man without mercy if you cross him as to him being hand under aerys  i dont consider it an accomplishment to serve under him apparently aeryss reign was all peace and quiet until the defiance and the rebellion and aerys was not that mad until the very end as i see it tywin got the reputation of being the true king because aerys was very much an absentee king he left the tiring daytoday business to his hand and old friend as long as tywin and aerys had no quarrel tywin did not do all his great things against king aerys but with him aerys apparently was no joffrey you did not need to distract him to prevent him from himself his dynasty or the realm as to the riches aerys left behind from all we know from the books its the master of coin who heads the treasury the hand does not directly oversee it so i guess aeryss unknown master of coin deserves more credit here than his hand as to him being the power behind king robert nonsense tywin ended up lending money to lord tywin but he had no active sayinfluence in the governance of the realm under king robert neither did cersei the realm was ruled by roberts council which was led by jon arryn and stannis baratheon during the greyjoy rebellion robert himself ned and stannis led the main forces into battle jaime apparently was the only lannister fighting in this war as a member of the kingsguard tywin allowed balon to destroy his fleet i doubt that robert would have allowed him to participate in the war afterwards ned stark was no hand during a peace time by the way he was hand during a time of crisis and instability i wonder how long young tywin would have lasted if he had come to kl mainly to investigate the murder of his best friend and making cersei queen jon arryn arranged that he counseled robert to accept her all tywin did was to offer her to robert and even that could only work because lyanna stark was dead a thing tywin had nothing to do with by the way tywins management of the defiance of duskendale is not exceptional either what did tywin do exactly he encircled the city and sat on his ass ryman frey did the same thing before the walls of riverrun apparently joffrey was right and the great lord tywin had indeed not the guts to facedefy aerys else he would have stormed the city after darklyn did not release aerys immediately barristan selmy saved aerys not tywin highgarden did not join stannis because loras took his forces and returned to the main host at bitterbridge and loras did not join stannis because he did not like him there was bad blood between highgarden and stannis since the siege of storms end and because he was renlys lover and suspected that stannis had a hand in renlys death littlefinger brokered the marriage between margaery and joffrey and this was the deciding factor here not tywin participating all he did was stumbling upon the tyrell forces when he came down the blackwater and why did he come down there because someone told him that stannis threatened kings landing and the deciding factor during the battle of the blackwater was renlys ghost and he was entirely littlefingers idea and how did the red wedding not backfire on king tommen its the very reason why half the north secretly plots stab the lannister representatives in the north in the back its the reason why manderly and others would back any pretender to the iron throne just for the chance of vengeance the red wedding enabled stannis to win the north to his cause i never said tywin was incompetent or and idiot but he has his limits and he did not oversee the red wedding or the westerlings that was his mistake he actually assumed walder frey would kill with an arrow gone astray merrett frey reveals that the red wedding was the brain child of roose bolton and lothar frey lord walder commanded it and tywin promised him a pardon in exchange for robbs head im quite convinced all tywin actually did was answering walders letter asking for a royal pardon in exchange for robbs head tywin confirms this implicitly during his conversation with tyrion about the red wedding and it was likely the same with the westerlings sybelle most likely wrote tywin about the fact that robb stark was smitten with her daughter offering hm to prevent him from fathering an heir in exchange for a royal pardon honors marriages and titles for her brother ser rolph and there was no communication between the freys and westerlings lady sybelle knew nothing about this in fact she was pissed about since one of her sons died at the twins while defending grey wind but back to the topic i really like charles dance in this role he truly is lord tywin and its the writing that makes him come to aryas aid but this is outofcharacter to book tywin he would not care about prisoners he would entrust those matters to the people he has charged to deal with such matters ie gregor and his men edited by lord varys 24 april 2012  0801 pm"
"Catastrophe",2012-04-25,"perhaps though i do think tywin would want to avoid having sadistic idiots like gregor waste resources for no real reason harrenhal is a huge castle in need of a large amount of people to staff it so putting an end to gregors pointless executions was the practical thing to doregardless i agree that charles dance is perfect for this role he really captures the gravitas that makes tywin who he is edited by catastrophe 25 april 2012  0455 am"
"Tywin's bastard",2012-04-25,"charles dance just has that majestic aura that he cant go wrong when playing tywin charles is the kind of man you can watch say rumpy pumpy in an interview and you still think hes the manliest man ever that ive always thought the lannisters are the most interesting family doesnt exactly hinder my enjoyment of this edited by tywins bastard 25 april 2012  0542 am"
"Ashen Shugar",2012-04-25,"i think book tywin is just as likeable as tv tywin like pretty much all of martins characters he is not one dimensional yes he is an arse but he has good reason to be so ive always been a bit sympathetic towards him well not always early on in the books i didnt like him but when you learn a bit more about him he grows on you"
"Mulled Wino",2012-04-25,"i read the books after season the first hbo season so i was biased by charles lance badassry when reading about booktywin thus i never saw him as a true villain and was actually pretty sad when tyrion killed himhim bossing around joffrey in season 3 was one of my favourite moments and no doubt the tvcrowd will fall in love with him even more afterwards because of this its very important that they keep the scenes of him insulting tyrion so that they understand and sympathize with tyrions decision to kill himi love when he punks joff"
"Mulled Wino",2012-04-25,"people are always shitting on tywins oarenting skills but he was off being the hand for like 20 yrs or something if im not mistaken those were probably the formative years of his childrens lives"
"Rockroi",2012-04-25,"just continuing the tywin debate yes tywin restored the glory of house lannister but he did not start from scratchwell nobody in this series really ever started from scratch so i am not sure what this really means in fact technically it was lord tytos who dealt with the reynes and tarbecks since well tytos lannister still was lord of casterly rock when tywin dealt with them we dont know all that much about the details but this was an open rebellion and not some backstabbing thing bolton and frey stabbed robb in the back whereas the reynes and tarbecks were stupid enough to rebel openly against their liege lordfirst this is irrelevant because your point was that tywin had never commanded men in the field not that he had never done so while lord and second its untrue â<U+0080><U+009C>lord tywin did not suffer disloyalty in his vassals he had extinguished the proud reynes of castamere and the ancient tarbecks of tarbeck hall root and branch when he was still half a boy martin george rr 20030304 a storm of swords a song of ice and fire book three p 272 bantam kindle edition in other words they were his vassels noyt his fathers laterjaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s father had never been unduly swayed by sentiment tywin lannisterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s own father lord tytos had once imprisoned an unruly bannerman lord tarbeck the redoubtable lady tarbeck responded by capturing three lannisters including young stafford whose sister was betrothed to cousin tywin â<U+0080><U+009C>send back my lord and love or these three shall answer for any harm that comes himâ<U+0080><U+009D> she had written to casterly rock young tywin suggested his father oblige by sending back lord tarbeck in three pieces lord tytos was a gentler sort of lion however so lady tarbeck won a few more years for her muttonheaded lordâ<U+0080>martin george rr 20030304 a storm of swords a song of ice and fire book three pp 607608 bantam kindle editionin other words tywin acted against the castemerâ<U+0080><U+0099>s etc after he became lord tytos would never have done somethinga s audacious as leveling the tarbecks and castemeres and again not sure what your point is if everyone agrees tywin was the one who achieved this end but ill still downplay this whole thing tywin did not prove himself to be a great military commander during this war no one ever mentions the great lord tywin even defeated a larger army in the field or something like that he proved to be a man without mercy at a very early age his whole reputation is that of a man without mercy if you cross himuntrue again you ignore tywinâ<U+0080><U+0099>s own advice to joff that after a war you have to help a foe off his knees thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s worth remembering and the fact that there are no stories of great military victories of tywin are 1 not true selmy states as much when remembering the defiance at tuskendale and 2 irrelevant nobody ever remembers great military victories by ned or hoster tully nor the blackfish etc but they all have pretty intact reputations and you are downplaying it because in the words of jim carey in liar liar its devestating to your case as to him being hand under aerys  i dont consider it an accomplishment to serve under him apparently aeryss reign was all peace and quiet until the defiance and the rebellionagain how is that easy ned totally blundered at ruling with peace and prosperity jon arryn was a good hand but then you will recall he helped bankrupt the ream and could not handle an outofcontrol robert and aerys was not that mad until the very endhe always showed signs of madness it was just accelerated after duskendale as i see it tywin got the reputation of being the true king because aerys was very much an absentee kingagain did not help ned or jon arryn did not help jon connington or the other hands that followed after tywin he left the tiring daytoday business to his hand and old friend as long as tywin and aerys had no quarrel tywin did not do all his great things against king aerys but with him aerys apparently was no joffrey you did not need to distract him to prevent him from himself his dynasty or the realmso was tywin a great hand because of his relationship with aerys or in spite of it did he rule the realm or not because here you are trying to say that tywin was great because he had a partnership with aerys again fat â<U+0080>lotta good such partnerships did men like connington and stark then try to saw aerys was an abscentee king so which is it it sounds to me like tywin lannister ruled the seven kingdoms for 15 years as to him being the power behind king robert nonsense tywin ended up lending money to lord tywin sic but he had no active sayinfluence in the governance of the realm under king robertso the fact that it was a lannister as grand maester that varys stayed on the counsel that his son was left on the kg that his daughter was queen that his money owned the crown that his men served in the watch and fought for the king all meaningless guess again the fact that jon arryn made robert marry cersei was proof of how much influence tywin had over it all and with robertâ<U+0080><U+0099>s spending you could not have a kingdom without lannister gold during the greyjoy rebellion robert himself ned and stannis led the main forces into battle jaime apparently was the only lannister fighting in this war as a member of the kingsguard tywin allowed balon to destroy his fleet i doubt that robert would have allowed him to participate in the war afterwardsagain we have no idea what tywin did during the war absence of evidence is not evidence of absence ned stark was no hand during a peace time by the way he was hand during a time of crisis and instabilityfirst of all there is a difference between war and crisis and ned did not arrive with either ned arrived at kl with about 7 years of peace and a stable realm made only unstable by well ned starkâ<U+0080><U+0099>s blundering second there were probablky hundreds of crisis that tywin handled while hand but tywin handled them while ned became overwhelmed by them tywins management of the defiance of duskendale is not exceptional either what did tywin do exactly he encircled the city and sat on his ass ryman frey did the same thing before the walls of riverrun apparently joffrey was right and the great lord tywin had indeed not the guts to facedefy aerys else he would have stormed the city after darklyn did not release aerys immediately barristan selmy saved aerys not tywinwait what should tywin have done put on a cape grab a sword and fly into duskendale to rescue aerys in other words a king acts boldly words that tywin openly mocks because they are so ridiculous coming out of joffâ<U+0080><U+0099>s mouth and here i would caution you you are taking the side of joff iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m just saying that may be a sign that you are on the wrong side of this debate i like the wasy you minimize every action tywin has done for decades by saying he â<U+0080><U+009C>stumbledâ<U+0080><U+009D> or â<U+0080><U+009C>sat on his assâ<U+0080><U+009D> and then never realize that in those cases tywin acted 100 correctly prudently and effectively i mean in your world you want tywin to ride on a blaze of glory and attack and fight and slash and slam but there is more to ruling than those things and in fact when it called for violence tywin was pretty much an assassin in delivering effective force castemere the red wedding duskendale tarbeck hall etc and add in the sack of kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s landing a move that probably shortened the war by a year and saved countless lives and the relief of blackwater bay and you have an impressive resume again i donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know what you want you want tywin to win all the battles but lose the war no thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s robb stark and the deciding factor during the battle of the blackwater was renlys ghost and he was entirely littlefingers ideano by this logic all that would need to happen would have been for one guy to ride out dressed as renly and tadah battle won nope highgarden went with tywin and tywin lead the attack tyrion says as much in the books in order for that to happen tywin needs to meet with highgarden which he did and in order for that to happen highgarden needs to know that they can make a deal with tywin which they did and how did the red wedding not backfire on king tommen its the very reason why half the north secretly plots stab the lannister representatives in the north in the backthatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not backfiring thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s what tywin knew would be acceptable losses having impoverished lords with wrecked households deplete of fighting men planning on stabbing you in the back is much better than having a large army actively fighting you on the battlefield with winter coming the north was done game set match game over man game over after the winter was over tywin et al would help the north to their feet exactly as he had commanded to joff who you seem to think has tywin peggedâ<U+0080> good luck with that the boltonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s would institute hard justice in the north and tywin would be there to meter out recovery it was a fantastic plan and had tyrion not gone soft oit would have worked yes tywin would have had to deal with stannis but thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s another story stannis is a hard nut to crack its the reason why manderly and others would back any pretender to the iron throne just for the chance of vengeance the red wedding enabled stannis to win

that tywin lannister will broker this reality and reward them all which he does the reality is that tywin lannister ruled the kingdom when he lost interest in a ruler or they pissed him off they stopped ruling look at what happened to aerys and robert he fought wars he defeated enemies and ruthlessly crushed usurpers and oputlaws in other words he was the guy you wanted in charge unless of

"David Selig",2012-04-25,"by this logic ned stark is a war criminal for allowing roose and ramsey bolton to exist at the dreadfort right but alas you like ned so no ned is a good lord and bolton exists and tywin is a bad man because clegane exists curiouser and curiouseri fixed this for you no need to thank me oh come on its not the same thing at all roose is smart enough to keep his brutality hidden from ned and ramsay wasnt on the scene before ned went south on the other hand gregors crimes are so well known even ned living thousand miles away have heard about hem and rodrick the stark appointed castellan actually arrested ramsay when he got a report of a crime he committed which obviously didnt happen with gregor neither robb nor ned took the boltons to war with the specific goal of using them for war atrocities and encouraging them to become even bigger monsters as tywin did with gregor amory and his other butchers but that its all beside the main point anyway just because others might have allowed their bannermen to commit atrocities on their subjects doesnt make tywin a good lord"

"Rockroi",2012-04-26,"morriganyou think that if robb or ned knew of the torture going on at the dreadfort he would have allowed iti think ned allowed quite a bit for starters the legends and rumors surrounding roose and ramsey are no less horrid than the ones surrounding gregor i think ned knew or should have known and also knew that the north respected stuff like that i mean if your argument is that ned was byinlarge a simpleton who needed stuff drilled into his head before he knew what was going on you get no argument from me my point is that ned had a good read on the men that served under him and he knew roose was a bad guy at the trident at the latest really robb is creeped out by roose when hes around him he does keep him around because he needs him to lead soldiers but he doesnt let him get away with atrocities if he has the power to stop themand tywin kept the mountain around because he was good at commanding men see why is one behavior acceptable in one and war crimes in anotherboth ned and robb make active efforts to stop atrocities from happening whenever they cannot really robb is pretty silent on atrocities we know his plan in the west was to raise havoc so i am not sure how thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not an atrocity given your lax definition and we never see ned command troops in battle or on campaign i think its safe to say that ned and robb are good people but in war that changes and mortifies i think robb especially was going to make the west bleed tywin on the other hand not only encourages them but he lets gregor get away with tons of crimes even before the war mind you because gregor is convenient to himi would say â<U+0080><U+009C>effectiveâ<U+0080><U+009D> again i am unclear how robbâ<U+0080><U+0099>s plan in the west was any different that tywinâ<U+0080><U+0099>s unleashing of the mountain after cat illegally kidnaps tyrion from the booksbut if he did not attack he would have been trapped in the west a thousand leagues from where he needed to be all the while we would have lived off his land instead of him living off oursâ<U+0080><U+009D>martin george rr 20030304 a storm of swords a song of ice and fire book three p 199 bantam

was something like 12000 men almost all on horseback not likley he could spare to parlay with these people seriously you are delusional if you think otherwise on the flipside if ned learns of atrocities or severe crimes being committed by his bannermen guess what he does he goes himself to arrest them ser jorah anyone jorah was lucky enough to escape before ned made it to bear island but it goes to show that ned wouldnt let a slaver get away with his crimesits unclear what tywin would have done about slaves because we never have seen it tywin does have a knack for executing people just like ned though and i would say that ned going out to bear island allowed jorah to escape when tywin wants a man taken that man gets taken seeif you think for a second that hed close his eyes on the atrocities at the dreadfort if he had known of them youre deluding yourselfagain i think its pretty clear that ned either knew about rooseâ<U+0080><U+0099>s actions or should have known the rumors and talk does not creep up overnight ned was warden of the north and really should have been able to figure out rooseâ<U+0080><U+0099>s propensities other lords would have probably dropped a few subtle hints beyond you know the banner being a flayed man and all i think to some degree ned knew that guys like roose had a valueand so did robb it should be noted glad i impressed you though the hairy bearthis is very simplistic isnt it war is horrible of course at the end its people killing each other but the ones who participate in it can try to minimize its horrors or can try to increase them robb did the former tywin did the lateri think both men did what they needed to do to win again robb was going to live off the land in the west much to the discomfort of those who lived there historically speaking â<U+0080><U+009C>living off the landâ<U+0080><U+009D> is a dicey proposition but we have a good example of it william techumsa shermanâ<U+0080><U+0099>s 186465 â<U+0080><U+009C>march to the seaâ<U+0080><U+009D> in the us civil war and that type of warfare was pretty horrible on the population there was that more robb or more tywin i say itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a little bit of both and that both men carried out some version of that war also robb spent the vast majority of the war in his lands or in his allies lands hence the chances for him to damage enemy land was small when he was in the west the record is clear he planned on uprooting that land for his and his armyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s own ends and there is nothing wrong with that in war tywin by contrast spends almost his entire war on enemy soil either in the east or in the riverlands and he does in the east what robb had planned to do in the east he also has to deal with guerrilla fighters most notably dondarion and thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not small in doing so he has to fight that war that way had robb stayed west he would be doing much the samerobb is a boy of sixteen do you really believe he would have given him the command of half of his forces if he knew full well what roose bolton isi do first i am utterly unmoved by robbs age robb was a man grown by westeros standards robb made many hard decisions had a great understanding of the men who served under him ie why he executed the karstarks knowing the umbers would be bad at certain things etc and knew the mettle of war second robb has inklings of roose and he seems to be creeped out by roose at certain points morigan says as much above i think robb thinks something like â<U+0080><U+009C>heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a dangerous man i am going to give him certain authority i am glad he does not commit atrocities around me the less i know about his maliciousness the betterâ<U+0080><U+009D> its called â<U+0080><U+009C>excusable neglectâ<U+0080><U+009D> maybe robb doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know but heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s happy he doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know i think its telling that all the acts of cruelty attributed to robbs army have been done by the part of the army commanded by lord bolton where robb was commanding weve never heard of burning fields killing peasants mistreat prisoners rapesagain by that same logic we could say that all of the rapes and cruelty done accredited to lions was done by the mountain and leave it at that on tywin but certain people do not also the story finds cruelty in war in many geographic areas and its not just by lions and wolves in this certain area the peasants et al talk about it in every area and they attribute the horrors to wolf and lion alike i think martin was very clear on this and does not make exclusions for either side now here me out if you were to plop me down in westeros and describe for me â<U+0080><U+009C>thisâ<U+0080><U+009D> example of an atrocity and have me wager who committed it i would probably guess â<U+0080><U+009C>lannsiterâ<U+0080><U+009D> more times than not and that has to do with a multitude of factors first robb is a nicer man than tywin second tywin is the one who is fighting the war in enemy controlled areas and dealing with guerrilla warfare third tywin has a more pronounced history of this sort of thing we have not followed robb much once he leaves riverrun therefore we do not see the war from a lannister pov to guage how bad the war was there fourth after robb returns we never see robb in the field again other than to execute the karstarks something he was 100 justified in doing but how come when robb executes people its fine but when tywin does its murder that to me is the nonsequitueragain look at the mountain the story that raffdunsenweespoliver i confuse them wherein the mountain pays an inkeep to rape that inkeeps daughter is despicable horrible its stomach turning and the mountain is a terrible person for doing it again look at the boltons and the flaying etc thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s despicable horrible its stomach turning and roose and reek are horrible people for allowing it if you allow nedrobb off the hook for one and blame tywin for the other its really not fair either they are both horrible or both

"The hairy bear",2012-04-27,"my point is that ned had a good read on the men that served under him and he knew roose was a bad guy at the trident at the latestyou keep saying that ned knew roose was a bad guy with the only basis that he suggested to execute a sworn member of the enemy kings personal guard just after the heat of the battle when barristan had just killed many of their friends in battle this cant be equated to a man who burned his brothers face who had crashed aegons skull against a wall who raped and murdered princes elia when she was not to be killed and who is rumored to have killed her wifeeven if we accepted that eddard suspected that roose was a bad guy which i deny he suspected at the most then you should still have to prove that he passed this information to robb you arew right that ar sixteen robb was a man grown by westeros standards but its also true that the fact that his father died so early and unexpectedly does not allow as to assume unequivocally that ned pased to his son all the information about which lords he trusted and which nottywin did absolutely unleash the moiuntain on tully homelands as a result of catlyns actions not the nicest thing a person could have done but a proporational response to such a flagrant disregard of the kings peacea proportional response are we talking seriously herea proportional response would have been taking one of catelyns sons as a hostage attacking the armies of the north catelyn was acting as a stark or the vale would be disproportionate but still somehow understanable attacking the armies of the riverlands already be out of proportion since hoster tully had nothing to do with the arrest but i still could see how some could defend itbut attacking the peasants of the riverlands withou declaration of war under no banners and you call this proportional please even tywin wouldnt agree with you"
"Rockroi",2012-04-27,"you keep saying that ned knew roose was a bad guy with the only basis that he suggested to execute a sworn member of the enemy kings personal guard just after the heat of the battle when barristan had just killed many of their friends in battle this cant be equated to a man who burned his brothers face who had crashed aegons skull against a wall who raped and murdered princes elia when she was not to be killed and who is rumored to have killed her wifeeven if we accepted that eddard suspected that roose was a bad guy which i deny he suspected at the most then you should still have to prove that he passed this information to robb you arew right that ar sixteen robb was a man grown by westeros standards but its also true that the fact that his father died so early and unexpectedly does not allow as to assume unequivocally that ned pased to his son all the information about which lords he trusted and which notrooses reputation preceded him by the time dwd rolls around its clear that the stories of roose and ramsey have been going around the realm for years and its not hard to fathom how these guys got their mutual reps by the time robb gets a hold of roose he is getting firsthand exposure to roose and its pretty obvious that robb suspects pretty heavily that this guy is trouble add to that stories that have been streaming out of the dredfort for literally generations and you can figure out how upsetting this could all beagain though i dont think it makes ned and robb bad people it makes them effective leaders warfare takes monsters sometimes they are ragons sometimes they are vipers and mountains but they get the job donea proportional response would have been taking one of catelyns sons as a hostage attacking the armies of the north catelyn was acting as a stark or the vale would be disproportionate but still somehow understanable attacking the armies of the riverlands already be out of proportion since hoster tully had nothing to do with the arrest but i still could see how some could defend itall utterly unrealistic and physically impossible in order for tywin to get north he would need to cut through tully controlled lands he would then have to get up moat cailen etc by tthat time tyrion could be dead hmmm not a good idea he could have done the same thing by trying to besioege the eerie but again he would havd to cut through tully lands now the last thing tywin could have done and its pretty silly to even consider it but its worth explring would have been to make a bline for kings landing and demand tyrions release from the king except it would be the hand who made the decision cats husband so thats perposterous right there consider if the rolls had been reveresed what if tywin had kidnapped robb for some crime and jaime sat as roberts hand would it be reasonable for ned to seek out jaime to free robb hardly also if cat really wanted to have done this correctly she would have returned to kl and demanded the imp be arrested again perposterous roberts wife is tyrions brotheri bring this up to illustrate something pretty profound cat did not wait around to do things by the book and because some guy she had not seen in 15 years lied to her and told her that her son was almost murdered by a dwarf she went and acted rashly funny when joff acts rashly hes a monster when cat does it its because she loves her son amazing but thats cool because sniff she loved her son sniff what are tywins options they all suck so he took the least terrible from his pov fuck everyone elses pov and began tearing up the riverlands the riverlands hjave lords to protect them they all suck so that ended that ned then sent men to get the mountain so in other words ned escallated hostilities but of course did not order the return of cat or tyrion to the kings justice wonder why beause he took the least terrible option from his pov and fuck everyone elses povagain its injustice so long as somebody else does it edited by rockroi 27 april 2012  0921 am"

"Rockroi",2012-05-03,"karstark he executed karstark for the murder of the pows when he very well could have given him a pardon like he did his motherwhile this is true robb really had to execute the karstarks the karstarks blatantly disobeyed robbs direct order he could not just let that go unpunished while he did pardon cat he really could not have executed his own mother fuck even tywin wouldnt do that i  i think i think if a lord of tywin lannister disobeyed a direct order from tywin lannister those bannermen would be just as dead in tyhis regard i think that robb and tywin are much alike and i fault neither one for that kind of action its hard and brutal being a lord and in all my criticism of robb stark i maintain that killing the karstarks was a sign of robb being a good leader robb was a bad and selfish lord too who screwed his subjects to satisfy his own pride but this doesnt make tywin a good lordthats not my point my point is that tywin is a good lord irrespective of how decent or humane he is and if i were a bannerman of a household i would want to serev one who had his priorities in order and winning has to be a huge priority masha was one woman against dozens of armed men who represent the most powerful lords in the area she couldnt do anything what authorities are you talking about  the lords whose men participated in the taking of tyrion lord hoster cats father yeah that would worksee what i mean masha allows tyrion lannister to be kidnapped in her inn at the time of the kidnapping tyrion and cat relay this fact later although some men rose many stayed seated masha just didnt want any trouble she could have said mlady this is tyrion lannister a soon of the rock certainly some of the men in the inn would have put two and two together at that point masha could then have said this man is a guest in my inn and therefore is protected by hospitality rights i love that every single person here completely ignored this fact a fact that tywin and frey are flayed for later on she could have alerted somebody and who was her lord edmurehoster tully yeah see my point edmure and hoster failed mightily in protecting their people i cannot have that if i am a bannerman to somebody like edmure or a failing hoster i need a lord who will look out for me let me switch this around so you see exactly what i am getting at robb beat the tar out of the crag and other areas of the west and what happened to robb oh thats right tywin made sure that guy was killed edmure et al could not do anything like that for their people tywin as usual didnt give a damn about fairnesswhich so why i would want him as my lord this is not hopscotch or checkers were playing now in dealing with his lords and his people tywin has always ben fair ruthless and stern maybe but never unfair like joff or lysa arryn  if not for the shadowbaby tywin was doomed he couldnt even defeat robb in the field if he had to fight renlys 100 000 in addition he wouldve been crushedyou have no idea none of us do if the shadowbaby had not come renly would probably have defeated stannis though stannis is like a cockroach at this point hed survive nuclear winter renly would have still needed to wait for his foot to make it to se by the time renly got that ponderous host moving towards kl tywin could have taken some actions again its speculation the problem is that you draw these deep conclusions without evidence as was said in the show if numbers decided everything mathematicians would rule how what do you care if tywin is more powerful if you die in the war he started or starve to death as a result of it even if you survive how does his increased power benefit youwell for starters he didnt start that war cat did when she kidnapped tyrion her source was a man known for trickery whom she had not seen in 15 years you restate this point many times but please do not mistake it the wife of the hand the kings best friend started the original war of this there can be no doubt it was a foolish move made on a whim without proper foresight or reflection its the textbook definition of why i would never want to be a stark bannerman because starks and their spouses do really crazy things just understand that by you saying tywin started the war that does not make it true and my point is not that by serving x lord or y lord i am somehow immune to death or starvation my point is that my odds of survival rise dramatically if i serve a lord who puts winning above all else my chances rise if i serev a lord who avoids catastrophe who is just and calculating who will not do dumb things when it matters most any bannerman to any lord can die either from the war or starvation or disease there are dead wolves all over the place that does not make robb stark a bad lord per se its how they died that matters look at the green fork fuck that would have sucked to have been a lord serving robb at that moment he sacrificed those men but thats not robb being a bad lord thats simply trying to fight a war that does not make robb bad and it should be noted that bolton and glover both survived the battle robb is a bad lord because he went back on his word and lead all his men to doom for his foolishness again i am not discussing absolutes here i gain no absolute immunity from serving this lord or that prince but the odds they swing wildly in my favor if i serve somebody like tywin or stannis instead of robb and edmure"

"akajea",2012-04-25,"no idea why they had him not wear shoulder armor when people complained that he was too skinny when he was casted i dismissed them thinking the costume magicians could make him look as bulky as a bear apparently not though as his lack of shoulderpads made him look somewhat pathetic other than that though im fine with it conan was the right size but he looked nothing like sandor and he looked half his age not an older brother i guess you dont get much choice when it comes to 7 foot actors"

"VRD",2012-05-21,"sooo a little late to the discussion but i thought id add my two centsi honestly feel for ian whyte as someone else mentioned having to climb into the shoes of stevens is no easy feat especially after the performance he delivered last season nor can i blame him for wanting the role after all when someone is a starving actor a role on a series like this can pay the bills and put food on the table however while i can understand wanting the role he never should have been considered for it thats the fault of whoever recast the mountain the first place whoever did that should be bloody fired imo as others have mentioned he just doesnt fit the role he iswas supposed to be this overwhelming and brutally largeintense individual this version of the mountain whatever attributes he may have is not those things at all a lot of people have joked that he looks like a basketball player which is funny because ian whyte used to play professionallysecondly while everyone is entitled to their opinion even the person who made the bizarre comment that recasting the mountain was the equivalent of recasting someone to play a predator for the predator series i have to respectfully disagree as someone else noted just because the mountain doesnt have a lot of lines doesnt mean his presence isnt paramount in the series he basically represents the viciousness and savagery that the lannisters are willing to use to get what they want his character is present and used in every book that has been released so far and his size is even more important come book 5 given the short amount of time conan had on screen last season and given that he was able to deliver that intensity anger and savagery it just seems a beyond amateur move for the series to have made when they decided to replace him especially with someone half conans width as others have mentioned given that many other characters are simply mentioned only in name this season they could have easily just kept him out of this season and referred to him by name in passing and brought stevens back in season 3what i personally find annoying now is that theyre actually giving whyte more lines than he actually had in the books too which solidifies the actor for this role just amateur all the way around when it comes to his character in this seasonoh and as an aside to whoever said that conan and rory dont look like brothers save from the fact that i would disagree based on their fight in season 1 i would suggest watching this httpwwwyoutubechvtiwx2fpx5k edited by vrd 21 may 2012  0912 pm"

"sarahstitcher",2012-05-20,"i agree that its beginning to be a little confusing the opening credits have done a great job in the past at showing us the overall landscape and where the specific places shown in the story are in relation to each other there has been enough of a match between the opening sequence and the look of the sites in the actual scenes to have some idea of oh this is where we are now but more recently it does seem like theyve omitted places from the opening sequence that it would be nice to get a better sense of especially since there are multiple armyencampments and the establishing shots in the scenes dont tell you at first glance which one it is no big banners or color schemes to make a quick id i hope im not out of line posting to this earlyepisode thread after watching up to episode 7 it seems like in this last episode and the one before ive had more than one which camp is this and where abouts is it moments"

"SerArthurHeath",2012-04-28,"i agree 100 though much of the problem is also the writing in the book a clash of kings stanniss feelings and motives are well documented we know why he is the way he is and why he is taking the action1 he saw his parents destroyed in a horrific shipwreck right outside of his own castle i stopped believing in gods the day i saw the windproud break up across the bay any gods so monstrous to drown my mother and father would never have my worship i vowed acok 1722 he felt slighted by robert for a number of reasons the first was his love for stark and lack of appreciation for stannis despite all he did he thanked stark for breaking the siege not stannis for holding the castle he blames stannis for allowing viserys to escape from dragonstone he is mad that he named ned stark hand of the king3 he wanted storms end his ancestral home he held it for over a year under siege sure he also took dragonstone from the targaryens but what he wanted was storms end i never asked for dragonstone i never wanted itstorms end belong to house baratheon for three hundred years by rights it should have passed to e when robert took the iron throne acok 24i also dont like that they made it so ned told stannis about joffreys true parentage he already knew he found out with jon arryn and when he died he left its like they are making stannis to be less than he should be to make ned seem more heroic or something when in fact it was stannis who even brought his theory to lord arryni know the show is super complicated and there are so many characters too many really for 10 hours but i think giving stannis a proper introduction and back story would have really served the showstannis can join the list of people that come worse off as the show tries to glorify the starks makes sense though as they are the good guys in a series famous for not being about good and bad guys in any objective manner though id argue that the truth behind that reputation is arguable"

"Lannes",2012-04-24,"i just dont understand why they are not giving him the lines the throne room scene is a perfect example both the hound and ser dontos could have said their lines and no one in the viewing audience would have been confused or befuddled or anything else it would have made that scene all the better but i guess we had to make room for ros in the next scene banggif classbbcemoticon altbang  i get it i know things have to be trimmed cut slashed moved around revised etc i also get that they are leaving out small inexpensive things that would make the show richer and better"

"So1ar",2012-04-24,"as good as the show is it is not without faults ros having more scenes than sansa and the hound can never be forgiven and the hound is probably in my top 5 characters for the whole series a little part of me is going to die inside if he goesnt give this line there are no true knights same as there are no gods if you cant defend yourself then die and get out of the way of those who can strong arms and sharp steel rule this world dont ever believe any different so david and dan if you cant give the hound his awesome lines then die and get out of the way of those who can wellmaybe not die thats a little strong but stop watering down his ragemadnessbadass personality they amplify the sex violence and ros scenes but not the hound gtfo nerd rant over edited by so1ar 24 april 2012  1130 am"
"Kittykatknits",2012-04-24,"well i guess it could be possible to save some exposition for when hes travelling with arya but that would make the drama and the inexplicability of his behaviour and the conflicting parts of his character you know less interesting but i guess what with tv and all something needs to be cut and perhaps his elevation to fan favourite was unintentional i think a lot of people are pretty good at picking up subtleties in the books and werent fooled by him being introduced as a villain though same as most people seem to think better thoughts of jaime lannister of asos than jaime lannister of agot and stannis as of adwd too in many wayson the other hand him being more submissive to joffrey hammers home that he actually did not have any authority to act like he did in acok with regards to sansa he really is just joffreys dog and cant do anything about joffrey being the little arse he is lying to save sansas posterior twice and attempting to interrupt the beatings were actually him failing at his job so to speaki dont think his elevation was that much of a surprise to him i remember reading an interview with martin some time ago and he talked about this he was surprised that darkstar was not more of a fan favorite considering how popular sandor was so who knows but as of now unless something significant happens in the next couple episodes i do not see how his future arc will make any sensegood point about him being so submissive to joffrey as a reader i can see all that i dont know if that will be obvious to those who only watch the shows thoughlyanna  kittykatknits  agree with everything that youve mentioned here their character dymanics have really disappointed me in the tv series in the books much of sandors interactions or interventions on her behalf with sansa are sort of subtle so maybe producers thought they might have a problem conveying that to screen dunnogif classbbcemoticon altdunno its quite possible ive noticed that the show this season has focused on characterscenes that have more of an action focus which is why i think the two of them have been waylaid so far it is also my belief that him seeoverhearing joff with the prostitute will be what stirs sandor to take a more active role with sansa so he will be strictly a protector for her my frustration is that this will eliminiate much of the dynamics between the two of them"

"jblair",2012-04-24,"he is far too nice all of the shots of him involve sympathetic expressions or a tensionfilled lack of expression there is no rage no fury no cynicism during the tourney he almost seemed meekly grateful for the accolades huh the bookhound truly doesnt give a rats ass what anyone thinks of him and his selfloathing leads to a combative personality not an overtly submissive one hes one of the most complicated characters in the books so i see the writers issues in fleshing him out however love him or hate him i think we can all reasonably agree that he is a complete and utter asshole"
"Lyanna Stark",2012-04-24,"i dont think his elevation was that much of a surprise to him i remember reading an interview with martin some time ago and he talked about this he was surprised that darkstar was not more of a fan favorite considering how popular sandor was so who knows but as of now unless something significant happens in the next couple episodes i do not see how his future arc will make any sensedarkstar maims a little girl and runs off sandor saves sansa from a riot saves arya at the red wedding kills beric despite being hung over and facing a flaming sword storms a ship on horseback cries extremely manly tears and is generally an overall bamf and sandor is not off the night either which helps a lot tonguepng classbbcemoticon altp on the downside she did not quite realize that sansa was acting and lying about her love for joff either so i guess the producers got some of what they wanted across but not alli thought that was fairly well established in the dinner scene with cersei tommen and myrcella edited by lyanna stark 24 april 2012  1221 pm"

"turdle",2012-04-24,"some others have touched on this but what really bothers me about the hbo series is that they seem so concerned with adding to the series at the expense of things that already exist at this point it seems like the show is at about a 25  from the book 75  not from the book ratio in these last few episodes and even the things that are from the books are often multiple scenes slammed together into one and then you get these long drawn out scenes that were created just for the show most of the time theyre well done well acted but they take away time from everything else two examples are ros and little finger and joffrey and rosother whore i think both of those scenes were pretty good but theyre so long and unnecessary and when the show is over you think back to them and youre like wow they could have actually spent time on things that really mattered instead of that it just reeks of arrogance to me they spend all this screen time on lf and ros and then the theon  ashayara scene is as bare fucking bones as possible hey hbo i like asha more than i like ros more asha less ros please"

"Lord Martin",2012-04-23,"i thought the shadow should have looked more like stannis iirc davos says that he would recognize that shadow anywhere also the idea that mel needed to use part of his soul to make the shadow was important as well visually it was very cool plot wise more could have been explained especially since the episode ended at 951 pm "

"WormofBook",2012-04-25,"it is entirely a subjective matter but i find littlefinger to be a super interesting character that only really started getting interesting after he steals sansa away i think that they are trying to give him screen time because of how important he is later on and how potentially compelling his story is i liked how he originally stopped himself from grabbing caits arm during their encounter but then breaks down and professes his love before returning to his cool and conniving self it sort of foreshadows the mad brilliance that defines his interactions with lysa"
"birdsong66",2012-04-26,"iirc he did actually grasp her armshe shook him off while asking if he had lost his mind i think what they hbo had him stop himself from doing was actually throwing himself on her but i could be mistakenalso suggesting that he knows where sansa and arya are and that they are safe allows him to still have a seat in the presentfuture at the catelyn table which given her considerable repulsion is the only one allowed him i think dd are firmly convinced of his complete and total obsession with her remaining to this day and gaining fuel ymmv of course"
"TheWrongKindOfSnow",2012-04-26,"i agree that hes a very interesting character and one of the ones who if anything i find more interesting in his television portrayal than in his book portrayal as the television version has added a lot more charisma hes interesting because he doesnt present as a key player in the battles for power but he keeps you wondering whether hes going to surreptitiously end up winning more than anyone i wondered what the point was of him losing his composure around catelyn in this episode they made it clear that shes his one weakness the one who has power over him as a consequence of his obsessive love for her but i think that seems a bit cliche and would hope his feelings maintain more complexity than that i wouldnt necessarily agree with your point that the scene foreshadows his later relationship with lysa since if they follow the books with her he will be very much in control the whole time  and not a bit in love im also not sure what the later transference of his affections onto catelyns daughter says about his feelings for catelyn herself  his attraction to her is anything but a straightforward obsession i thought that was better captured in the ambiguity of his offering her neds bones  does he genuinely care for her enough to respect her love for ned or is he just pretending to be sympathetic in order to win her favour"
"Capt Banjo",2012-04-26,"i agree with the op anyone that has read the books knows the impact littlefinger has in the future i believe hbo is giving him some new materialscenes to keep him in the minds of unspoiled viewers as a reader it was great to see what he has pulled off behind the scenes up to adwd and some of it was a complete surprise that was ok and did not feel out of place it was great writing amidst hundreds of pages tv viewers on the other hand are not as forgiving for big eventssurprises that have no build up hbo probably feels like with only 20 hours of tv by the end of season 2 it may be imperative to add more littlefinger scenesdepth to keep him in sight and in the minds of viewers i have no doubt that grrm and the hbo writersdirectors will make littlefingers exploits and future plans just as exciting as they were in the book it looks like we will just get some extra depth to keep newcomers interested i cant wait to see it i loved littlefinger in the books and i am warming up to his tv character as this season progresses"
"Tadco26",2012-04-27,"the problem is the depth they have created for him is contradictory to his book character the most calculating and politically adept player is politcally clumsy in the show constantly sticking his foot in his mouth and letting everyone know that he knows their secrets personally i think they added scenes because you cant keep a good actor under contract for multiple seasons without giving him some scenes unfortunately i think the vast majority of his scenes have been poorly written and instead of giving us more insight into his character they have given us insight that is opposite his book character in so many ways if they wanted to give insight they could have him selling offices in the government for money accepting and giving bribes recieving reports from his spies and all the while being the smiling friend to those in power who appears to be the loyal subject as for tv audiences being unforgiving towards surprises i disagree lost was a big hit in part because people loved speculating about the mysteries ben linus was very much a littlefinger like character who spoiler was physically unimposing and starts off looking relatively harmless even though they suspected him of being an other they had no clue he was their leader or what he was capable of book littlefinger is a master manipulator and investor who happens to own some brothels while tv littlefinger personally trains the whores in his brothels and cant keep a secret to himself to save his life i fear that tv littlefinger will require a huge suspension of disbelief to accept that he set up all these events dating back to before season 1 with his rise thru the court to master of coin due to jon arryn and his murder at the hands of lysa at his request as well as the framing of cersei for the deed"

"dansnow",2012-04-25,"but what does setting up joffrey as opposing tyrion do nothing comes of it until what will probably be season 4 of the show he does nothing in defiance of tyrion in acok unless im forgetting something so whats the point of starting this storyline 23 years early when story lines that need to be started now to make sense later are put on the back burner again i dont hate ros scenes because she is in them but because they arent pushing other characters story lines along either for instance her scene in episode 1 didnt bother me its possible that they are setting up joffrey for the alayaya scene in which case i guess this ros scene works still dont like the littlefinger one but that will only weaken cerseis character so i still wont like the change because cerseis story is much more interesting than joffreys edit but if they want to replace alayaya with ros im fine with that edited by dansnow 25 april 2012  0351 pm"
"Davos55",2012-04-25,"my prediction is that the show makes it so joffrey sends meryn trant to kill tyrion during the battle of the blackwater he seems to be his go to guard for his dirty work that the hound wont accept and he clearly doesnt like tyrion or bronn meryn is the only other kingsguard member who the show has even identified besides jamie and sandor so i am guessing they will go for another book deviation and have meryn attack tyrion and be killed by pod in the process mandon moore is nowhere to be found and i believe the book is rather ambiguous about who sends him to kill tryion though it is hinted at being cersei more so than joffrey the route the show is taking it looks like cersei is going to be a more sympathetic character than she is in the book"

"dansnow",2012-04-25,"i think youre probably right in that davos55 good thinking"
"Fredwin",2012-04-25,"at some point dd are going to have to choose between making good television or sticking with whats in the book obviously you cant and shouldnt follow the book 100 not even close to 100 the problem i see and its especially evident in the ros scenes is that while these scenes might be needed you have to fill in other plote holes as wellif youre going to deviate from the books fine great but do it in a good way like what was done with theons scenes this gives you room to add more scenes with jamie to add more scenes with the hound to add more scenes with dany the characters that were in season one shouldnt mysteriously disappear with no explanation were almost halfway through acok and almost none of the major plot points in the book have even been touched yet so yeah less ros scenes would be crucial at this point whats needed is another 5 episodes"
"Khal-a-bunga",2012-04-25,"my take on ros is that shell have a scene with tyrion where she explains what happened with joffrey which will lead to cersei finding out about her like what happened with someone in the books cant remember her name anyway its already been pointed out that ros is more of a composite character than an entirely original invention of dd so i cant for the life of me see what the big deal is economical storytelling is what id call it and really were on episode four every episode following will be longer than these first four ep 05 57 min ep 06 54 min ep 07 56 min ep 08 57 min ep 09 57 min ep 10 64 min acok is a considerably more difficult novel to adapt into ten episodes and as a result things are going to have to be shuffled around delayed or even cut entirely i think this thread is definitely an interesting idea and id like to follow it throughout the season but four episodes in simply isnt enough to get the bigger picture so complaining about where the numbers lie at this juncture doesnt seem like a worthwhile endeavor"

"IronSuitor",2012-04-23,"i agree hes different than i perceived it mainly for exactly the reason you said  we didnt actually see much of him and one can still be in love with someone or at least obsess over the fact that you used to love someone while realizing that they are no longer objectively beautiful i could see littlefinger letting his mask drop in front of catelyn if only for a little so that didnt bother me nearly as much as the scenes in court overall i dont think it will affect any of the later badassery he pulls off right now i just think the writers are struggling to give him screentime when the source material doesnt do much for him"
"Ponyo Payne",2012-04-23,"maybe i will break this down more later when im not on my phone but i have a number of feelings here a sense of loss disconnect and mild confusion i am thinking at this point that i should probably start thinking of tv petyr separately from book petyr and base future actions and expectation against that character alone which makes sense to some degree but actually trying to do that is kind of confusing also with all of his interactions from this episode what part of the action was tyrions plot what part is petyrs own scheming and what part is just empty writing which there seemed to be some of this week i dont know if looking at any of the angles make any sense anymore do you null"
"Envie",2012-04-23,"well i think the idea from the books is that while yes hes spent his whole life recreating himself into a greater man figuratively because he was not considered worthy enough by the tulleys as a boy he did truly have love even if a first crush kind of intense love for catelyn hes always wanted the chance to get her back i dont think it was a badly played scene  if a little awkward for littlefinger to expose himself and his true wants from catelyn for a brief private moment tyrion sent him to negotiate and bring back neds bones to her but of course hes going to throw in a little selfish negotiations too"

"Giskard Reventlov",2012-04-24,"i realize this isnt exactly a new complaint but the changes to littlefinger are starting to get to me i thought they wrote him very well in the first season and he was exactly like i thought hed be sly and always 15 steps ahead of everybody he projected confidence and some mystery you never really knew what to expect from the guy compare that to this season where hes telling cat he loves her and almost getting cersei to kill him that is not littlefinger he wouldnt have tipped his hand the scenes lack the poise and calculatedcautious maneuvering which is so central to the character so far weve seen tyrion play off his greed and lose himself around cat this makes him appear to be more of a pawn and less of a player than he was in the first season in particular when it paired him with varys as two rivals competing for the thronethoughts thoughts on lf in generali agree with youone thing that annoyed me in lotr movies and made me hate them was change of charactersi dont mind much when they omit or add something from the book that cant fit on the screen but i hate when they change characters and that is what they do with littlefinger instaed of being subtle he is rush and is acting stupidlf from the books would never taunt cersei or even margaery"

"voodooqueen126",2012-04-24,"i can see where theyre going with littlefinger looking at his arc throughout the books im starting to see the narrative sense of punctuating his scenes with him being fast and loose with his thoughtsregarding his encounter with cat spoiler this is what seeds his uncomfortable fascination with sansa he realizes at this point that hell never have catelyn back sansa is a younger naive more beautiful and more impressionable version of cat littlefinger sees in sansa a chance to start over again now that he is a man of position book readers keep whining that littlefinger is losing his mystique as an unknowable master manipulator but im thinking of his character in terms of the long run and how nonreading audiences see him its fascinating seeing him still slip up and bawl  after all hes still a man bookfinger seems to have become this archetype too much of an ideal like cersei in the series theyre adding layers to his character this is important when the show reveals the depths of littlefingers machinations they can have these slight character moments that will inform where his motivations come fromat this point littlefinger exposes himself because of hubris spoiler book readers know that he basically sparked the war between the starks and lannisters and may have nudged joffrey to execute ned his stumbling about may be interpreted as overconfidence in his own abilities and achievements pride surely commeth before the falli think that littlefingers aims were basically destructive this makes him unpredictable if you think he is rational like all the others but once you realise that his aims are destructive he becomes quite predictablei would disagree that littlefinger loved catelyn he loved the idea of her the concept of her as a high status person with a degree of charisma but her values are inimical to his own indeed in terms of values littlefingers true mate was lysa not cat"

"Sword of the Morning Wood",2012-04-24,"my thoughts about littlefinger from the books is that when its all over if hes the last one standing and he gets what he wants thats all that matters he genuinely doesnt care what people think of him unless he needs people to think of him a certain way as a means to another end it goes with the territory with lf and varys that they play such a longer game than anyone else that the only way we can really judge their actions is when the game is finished i think that portrayal still holds in the show ok lf tells cat he loves forgetting for a moment that he never met cat at bitterbridge but we know he was on a mission from tyrion as he was in the books and im pretty sure hed do anything he thought was neccesary to achieve what he wants make himself look weak put himself at someones mercy whatever littlefingers mind doesnt work like most characters he doesnt care if he loses face in the short term when all around them have lost their heads or are ruined and hes still keeping his head above water thats when he knows hes won for me tv lf is still consistent with that weve already seen tyrion play lf in the books over myrcellas betrothal and lf does have an arrogant streak where hes cheeky to those in more powerful positions than him ned already came very close to hurting him tyrion could easily have done the same at many points in the book its entirely conceivable that his tongue could have gotten him in trouble around cersei in the manner of the tv show in the books tyrion considers having him killed but recognises that he has too much use to waste like that its tyrions restraint and intelligence that stay his hand cersei has neither of those things so could easily be pushed to threaten or hurt much quicker than tyrion"

"Tadco26",2012-04-24,"i agree that tv littlefinger is a shadow of the book character i realize that they have to add some scenes to keep the actor happy but i have not been happy with the scenes they have written one would get the impression that he is a brothel manager who is master of coin in his free time rather than the master of coin who happens to own some brothels among his many investments tv littlefinger is a poor politician and very open with his plans feelings and information now some here argue that this is how he was then and he will grow into the master planner we see later but the problem with that is his plans revealed later started way back before season 1 when he spoiler had lysa kill jon arryn  book littlefinger reminds me of benjamin linus on lost or verbal kint in the usual suspects who initially seem to be pawns or completely unthreatening and only much later do we find out what they truely are that was the type of character i was hoping littlefinger would be on the tv show unfortunately if the changes continue on their current course it will make seeing him as a master mind villain later either be completely predictable or completely unbelieveable if they needed more scenes for the actor i wish they would have added scenes showing how he was selling postions in the government for money or reinvesting the crowns money have some of his spies reporting to him it might even make ros a more acceptable part of the show if she was spying for littlefinger rather than being directed by him in a medieval porno i think that added scenes should accentuate the books interpretation of a character not completely contradict it as most of the created littlefinger scenes have done"

"Stenbuck",2012-04-24,"i agree with most everyone on this thread littlefinger became my favorite character in the whole series by books 3 and 4 before then he was just some schemer in the court with the occasional appearance and the occasional surprise neds death tyrell recruitment  i thought him definetly above pycelle but definetly below varys and tyrion it was by the purple wedding and his reveals shortly after that i came to be fascinated by this character with this said i do not know why they are making the character so plain for everyone to see right now in seasons 1 and 2 for me at least my interest in this guy derives from the fact that you always knew he was a bit of a scumbag but you never had any idea just how much he may well have been the person most directly responsible for the war of the five kings for crying out loud and managed to come out of it winning big  and this came as a complete shock to me so i simply cannot understand why did they not choose to just let lf be the quiet greasy superficially friendly guy he is in the books  and just come out in seasons 45 and blow everyones mind"

"Planetary",2012-04-22,"yes but tyrion doesnt consider taking joffrey to a brothel out of altruism its just an idea to keep him occupied on nonconsequential things thus the previews of joffrey hefting a crossbow which in the books was another distractioniirc tyrion said something like a shiny new toy to keep him occupied and i agree with everyone who mentioned the peach that was a great scene in the books and in the tv show its a good opportunity to give davos more screen time and show the viewers that stannis truly values the honest counsel davos offers"
"dark  sister",2012-04-22,"a missing sentence from danys convothe girl asked what viserys had said and dany answered he said they eat meat the girl then goes on to ask what kind of meat etc thats when dany says viserys didnt know anything about anythingthe missing fact in all this is of course that they eat charred meat perhaps viserys never mentioned that to danyalso it seems easy to me to resolve other than serendipity by dany she offers drogon a hunk of raw meat he rejects it she flings it away in frustration and drogon immediately sends out a blast and charbroils iteta that last scenario i described makes sense to me for another reasoni would think dragons would be hunters like hawks cats sharks the hunting instinct kicks in when the meat is movingwell in the book viserys says to a younger dany only men and dragons eat cooked meat she remembers that in the red waste and thus feeds them cuz theyre on the edge of starvation my point was the scene would have been a lot simpler and less confusing fans wondering about whether the dragons were starving to death if they just used what was in the bookwhat you propose is a good scenario yet it still fits in the category of serendipity by dany she offers it to drogon he doesnt take it she flings it away in frustration and drogon following the motion breathes firei may not be remembering my timeline wthe dragons correctly but when did they first start huffing flame i thought drogon as usual was the precocious one and breathed flame in the house of the undying to spoiler save dany from the rotten heart whelp the new episode is about to start for me but feel free to reply"
