"Daenerys",2011-05-01,"throwing out the top and bottom 5 i get an average of 78 for this episode"
"John (Snow) Doe",2011-05-02,"those of my friends who are also fans of the series agree with me an efficiently laidout opening offering as much information as possible but lacking in wow moments that both define the series and hold power to attract nonreaders i was very happy they stayed loyal to the books but i think this actually became a detriment since the opening is slowly paced and doesnt draw you in right away i was honestly reminded of how lukewarm i was on the series when i started reading  of course i eventually became a pageturning devotee but that didnt occur probably until page 250 the coldopening was extremely well done and powerful but apart from that i dont see what in this episode beyond the sheer novelty of the series would attract a nonreader audience a pilot should be a series wrapped into 1 episode that is it should offer a taste of whats in store i dont think that was done here and im concerned"
"DecoyRunner",2011-05-04,"disappointing of course they couldnt possibly match the world characters and themes of asoiaf in the first ep but even knowing that and allowing for some wobbles i found it rather underwhelming they have an excuse to get all expository in the second and third episodes but the first should have left us breathless theyre playing it a little safe imo i was not overly shocked or impressed by the daenerys scenes not that i was offended or that i disapprove im just desensitized i guess love the opening credits and theme song i love the books and have been waiting for this day for a looooong time so ill be with them till the end whenever that may be maximum dinklage airtime ftw edited by decoyrunner 04 may 2011  0844 pm"
"Talan Snow",2011-05-18,"i think the series has been brilliant my one and only complaint is that the others if that was an other that we saw in ep 1 are nothing like the description in the book"
"Buster",2011-05-28,"just finished watching winter is coming and thought that it was great a perfect start to what will be an amazing series its very faithful to the book and therefore compared to most shows it was quite slow paced and had little action since they had a lot of locations and characters to introduce it was probably a good thing especially for people that havent read the book looking forward to the rest of the series best thing about the episode peter dinklage is perfect as tyrion and somehow manages to be just as awesome as the character in the book"
"TheWhiteWolf",2011-06-07,"brilliant it got me so interested in the world of a song of fire and ice that i went out and bought all the books and read them in two weeks flat however i only gave it a 9 not a 10 because it came out during exams and seriously screwed up my revision"
"colossus the unstoppable",2011-07-04,"seeing the previews for the episode and reading about the show online is what hot me into the books this episode may not be the most interesting of the series but i will always be special to me"
"lyvyathan",2011-10-17,"i was blown away it was top notch"
"Chelly",2012-01-31,"i liked it a lot but it was definitely the slowest episode of the series it was necessary though because you are introducing the audience into a whole new world"
"Lord Bear Mormont",2012-03-01,"read all the books but have not seen the series yet cant wait until dvd are released"

"KingIn7heNor7h",2013-07-04,"my favorite episode to date the introductions of the characters were incredible you get a real touch of the northrip ned stark"
"Frey-A-La-Mode",2013-07-05,"i watched the first season before reading the series and now ive read it thrice and i can tell you that i was drawn in right away mind you i have a lot of patience for these types of epic shows with a lot of characters and a lot going on but besides not getting every little detailname right away i found i could follow it pretty closely and i really dug it i loved the first scene with the otherswhite walkers i loved the introduction of the starks i loved the royal family i loved the direwolves i loved the scenes in essos i remembered posting on my facebook is it bad that merely the opening credits of game of thrones is enough to get me hooked that said i can see why people say that noobs or people who are not already predisposed to fantasycourtintrigueepics there might not have been a lot to draw people in i watched the first episode with a good friend of mine and he was pretty underwhelmed that is up until bran got thrown out the window that made him go whoa as in this show does not fuck around edited by freyalamode 05 july 2013  0707 am"
"Sothoryosdragon",2014-05-04,"so it was revealed in the show how john aryn actually died in season 4 episode 5 he was killed by his wife and littlefinger the death of john aryn was basically the opening of this episode and in turn the catalyst for the events in the series its just interesting to see how far things have come since the first episode and how things are tying in"
"The L.E.D.",2015-02-04,"its been a while since you posted this but allow me to add my two cents â i only now that im watching the show again from the beginning truly seeing how the show is from the very beginning setting littlefinger up asâ theâ schemer of schemers hes constantly at work whether with the nedcatelyn business or by giving offhand remarks to sansa at the tournament trying to rock the boat all the time its like his every word pierces a heart somewhere in the seven kingdoms brilliantâ"
"LugaJetboyGirl-irra",2011-04-22,"so i finally just watched the first episode on hbo go with all the special features hbo did a phenomenal job there was some really cool stuff there for example there was a kick ass little video about how they filmed the prologue apparently it took them 10 weeks to get the snow all laid out id say it was worth it i thought the prologue scene was beautiful it was also cool to see some of the props up close for example i hadnt actually realized that roberts crown was essentially shaped like antlers they even had a 360 degree view of lyannas statue and a cool video of one of the ds explaining about how shes the only woman robert ever loved and the significance of the feather incidently there were two statements related to the recent fan controversies at the filming of the dothraki wedding the director i think said that we are supposed to see the event through danys eyes with everything being scary and other in one the other little videos benioff was talking about how in the infamous dany bath scene viserys actions made perfect sense to him viserys because in other circumstances they would have been married but we the viewers are definitely supposed to find it creepy i know part of the reason they included all those special feature things was to further help people who were confused by the details but i thought it was also just something super cool to do for the fans having been a torn reader from back at the beginning i definitely got to experience what it felt like for the cast and crew of the project to really want to please and include the fans it was this special features thing that really drove home just how much hbo is taking it to the next level it kind of made me feel a little warm and fuzzy inside"

"legba11",2011-04-23,"i said it earlier long thread but i dont think theres anyway that martell would do something so obvious as give a public gift to drogo at his wedding he is clearly established as a very patient and cautious and openly admits that drawing the ire of the lannisters thus certainly the still strongly allied barethonlannister throne would mean the doom of his people if he was to give a gift it would have been very notpublic i think a stronger case could be made it was a gift from oberyn martell he is the viper and he is much more willing to openly stand in defiance"

"Kaitscralt",2011-04-23,"why cant the snakegiver have just been some random person presenting a gift that was supposed to weird daenerys out its only the pilot"
"LugaJetboyGirl-irra",2011-04-23,"why cant the snakegiver have just been some random person presenting a gift that was supposed to weird daenerys out its only the piloti agree although it would be cool to have some dornish business going on snakes are definitely a surefire way to further freak out a sheltered girl who is supposed to be terrified by all the scary others around her"
"Daenerys",2011-04-23,"yeah i personally think the snakes were just some random giftgiver i wouldnt try to read too much into it but then again who the hell gives a crate of snakes as a wedding gift uhthanks i guess but as i recall drogo gives no reaction at all to this if it were really unusual or insultng or shocking wouldnt he be surprised or angry or something just seems like another poorly thought out lets think of anything weird to make the dothraki more exotic move like lets say eyeliner on a warlord edited by daenerys 23 april 2011  0153 pm"
"legba11",2011-04-23,"yea i already said i think the snakes were just a random gift fun to speculate while we wait for tonight oberyn wouldnt give snakes as a scheme other than to tweak robert and his brother he definitely seemed a lets poke it with a stick and see what it does type in the short time we got to know him"

"CryFenril",2011-04-24,"i think what will was saying was forgive me my lord to ned for being an oathbreaker he also protests that hes not a coward and asks for news to be brought to his mother so i think its just him interacting personally with ned as for the snakes  it neednt be anything political or overt yet just oberyn being curious and sneaking into the wedding to get a look at the last targaryens bael the bardstyle only instead of songs its snakes he brings and no he wont be making off with the lovely maid hes just taking a peek to stay abreast of things if that is in fact what were being teased with its very subtle indeed it could even hint at alleras but i think the serpents can really only point to one personit strikes me as the kind of homage dd would toss in there as a nod to those in the know  sort of an acknowledgment of the people who are diehard fans and would go berserk over something absolutely inconsequential because we know what it might mean its a minor detail that means nothing in and of itself but those quick enough to catch it would get all wiggly and happy maybe i could just be overexcited and reading too much into it naaaah i never do that edited by cryfenril 24 april 2011  0917 am"

"RemitMan",2011-04-25,"the first episode does a tremendous job dealing with the execution and the discovery of the wolves everyone is present and all of the most important lines are delivered flawlessly in particular sean bean shows a reluctant determination as he almost whispers the sentence of death this scene shows us jon bran and eddard and reveals much about their characters on the other hand the most disappointing scene in the first episode is the wedding night of daenerys and drogo the book surprises us by revealing drogo as a sensitive and loving husband the series shows us a rape scene one of the most touching and special moments of the first book is completely reversed how can dany come to love someone whoâ<U+0092>s raped her the series has taken its first serious misstephttpasoiafovrnitthroness01e01"

"red snow",2011-04-29,"just caught up on the show i was on holiday and i was quite pleased with it some of the cast are instantly standing out for me arya theon viserys almost wish they had cast the actor as someone else as hes great and of course tyrion i thought jason momoa was being underused but hopefully thats intentional so that we can see that he is not as bad as he initially seems the tv show is making him far leass sympathetic already i was worried though that people who havent read the books may be confused though something i found happening in later installments of the potter films i may not notice as i can fill in the gaps with the books as a control ever the scientist i asked my brother who has never read the books what he thought two episodes in and he thinks its good a bit like rome and that the dwarf is good seems like the show is doing things right in that respect my major grumble is with the intro which is excellent aside from the clockwork building of cities i find that really irksome as to me it screams steampunk which is nothing at all like the technology present in westeros i think this would confuse even nonfantasy readers as well im pleased they made a biggish deal about discovering the direwolves although it was a pretty quick transition into them ageing up and two episodes in i feel they are shying away from the wolves when they can perfectly understandable considering they are a tricky element to film seeing the mother though im reassured that the wolves will become more dire come season 2 smilegif classbbcemoticon alt  regarding that scene vicky pointed out to me that jon snow stops before ghost yelps we initially thought that was a bad editing mistake bit then i wondered if they were actually being really clever the books clearly indicate a connection between the stark children and their direwolves already the show has me doing loststyle coverups for potential mistakes edit i forgot that the actor playing joffrey was excellent too hes a complete an utter little shit and thats exactly how joffrey should be i can see his scenes being a guilty pleasure so far the bad guys are definitely stealing the show for me cant wait for littlefinger edited by red snow 29 april 2011  0301 am"

"RSasoiaf",2011-05-08,"finally got to see it all this weekendit was hard to get considering i found no way to get hbo around here regarding the episodelove it itâs bound to be epic well done my only notes tyrion and arya were just over the top altough actors were good and scenes were funny so it doesnt really hurts it looked good but has others said on tyrion he does not come across in the book like we see him in his first scenes episode 1 tyrion is on a different level compared with book tyrion but its ok because as i have seen on following episodes he seems to be getting on track on arya yeahhh maisie is just perfect and whatever they write she will perform a small wonder out of it stilli had the feelling that was not really the arya we start with in the book i have the fellling book arya is a lot more shy and inside the closet to beggin with i feel its only after facing joff and loosing nymeria that she really starts to go a bit more agressive towards sansa and only after syrio does she openly sees herself as a possible warrior also the kind of passion commitment and sacrifice she goes through in order to try and become a warrioriâm not sure people will understand that or even buy it if the show tries to go there because as for the show she already started like a little warrior very confident a natural both the scene wth the bow and the food play in the banquet are a bit unrealistic considering what we know about her in the beggining and boy would she get in trouble if she would do that food fight on the royal banquetshe is not the starkâs jester but a lady from a high house but again it looked good so let it be smilegif classbbcemoticon alt  i was pleased with seing it on the most often complaints catâs motives iâm ok with it its a change but im ok with it it doesnt go that far from the character and she can still get back on track and do what she will have to do theon we have time for him latter the crypt and the lack of info about lyanna and the rebelion miss it a bit but thereâs still time for that also sandor no problem i will give the guy the chance and trust he can act bad ass dannydrogo no problem also i understand what they are doing i would still like to have danny start showing her dragon blood from the 1st step but its ok if they want to make for a more weak girl grows strong story ark in reallity dannyâs book does have the power and the will to fight since the beggining she just cant see how she should use it and she is more or less misguided by viserys view on the universe which is more or less the only one she has to start with this is why she has a good first night with drogo why she proudly mounts her silver she really wants power she really feels like being a queen is her destiny she may not be so sure on the path she is taking but she does want to be powerfull and she imediatelly feels somewhat attracted by drogoâs power and by the same logic she quickly dismisses viserys as week as soon as she can compare him with other better examples hboâs danny will be a bit different but in the end will get more or less to the same place i believe so its ok"

"opark77",2012-03-15,"ok so im a noob to the hbo threads and i just bought the dvds and watched them all within the last 24 hours i want to jump in and discuss but im a year too late be that as it may these are some of the things im thinking about on first viewingthat must have been a mammoth viewing session if you watched all ten and the commentariesthe lift cage at the wall i like that they put it on a track rather than a hanging swaying contraption like in the books im a little skeptical about the manpower of the lift though that fricken thing would be heavy and they just show one poor bastard walking a wheel to lift itat the very least it should be counterweighted with a load equal to the weight of the lift leaving the operator to hoist the weight of the cargo only i will admit that this is the sort of thing that would only interest engineering geeks so i wont belabor the pointexcept to add that im missing the switchback stair it will be important later and im curious what they will do when the time comes also a lift on a track cant swing over to deliver jon snow on the north side of the wall for his fateful meeting with mancewe dont see that at all in this episode do we you make a valid point regardless about counter weightinggemma jackson production designer did a featurette on the lift design if you want to see some behind the scenes footage of ithttpwwwyoutubechvwjctf6t4co4the flipflop of catelyns approval for ned accepting the hand job im guessing that they chose to make the tv character argue against it in order to make the cat more likeable to the viewing audience and i dont necessarily fault them for that but someone who is deeply familiar with the book version its a major departure for the whole motivations and essence of the characterbut you get the angeldevil shot with her and luwin over neds shoulders out of it i agree it is a sweeping change however it didnt seem to affect her through the rest of the season why do you think she wants him to go in the book i think her motivations in the book lie with firstly with the protection and secondly with the betterment of her family she recalls the symbolism of the direwolf with the stags antler in its neck signifying that she thinks robert poses a threat to her family and concludes that ned must not offend robert by declining ned also realizes that she is keen for sansa to become queen one dayin the show they have dropped the secondary concern with the betterment of her family but her primary motivation is still protecting them  she has just reached a different conclusion about the dangers of the situation and the best course of action she takes neds position from the book of wanting to stay in winterfell in the show luwin argues alone for going south while in the book he backed her up having the two sides verbalize the arguments for and against the decision to go south helps to create a dynamic and dramatic moment for eddardditto on tywin gutting an animal i get it that they needed to communicate an air of menace immediately as the foundation of that character in the books george has the liberty of developing that menace without tywin speaking a word but even for a great actor that would be hard to pull off in a 23 minute scene nevertheless i have that fangirl kneejerk reaction that lord tywin would never do thathe would command a servant that detail would be entirely appropriate to the introduction of randyl tarly but not lord tywinive seen this kneejerk reaction several times i dont understand it i thought the symbolism was fantastic and that the barely contained rage of book tywin was well expressed by show tywin killing and butchering a stag all on his own it also speaks to his appreciation of well honed skills and his distaste for other people the english gentry still go on about respect for the animals they hunt todaythe first ride in the commentary they delicately indicate that the actors didnt feel capable of communicating that switch of tone from brutal to romantic but it doesnt quite scan for me in the books drogo has his game face on during the public portionseeming warlike and hardbut once he gets dany alone he is all gentleness albeit with the unstated fatalism that she is gonna get fucked one way or the otherhe is patient with her fears and her timid modesty he gives her time to transition through her emotions come to acceptance and ultimately desire in real time im guessing that this evolution would take at least an hour realistically that could only be done on screen with a montage and i cant blame them for not going that routethe real shift is from the first ride to the second drogo is all sensitivity and consideration at first but in the books he quickly settles in to the sort of sexual dynamic with which he is more familiar and that has always seemed to me to be the disorienting and troubling partbecause the hbo version starts with rape it throws the whole dynamic off because why is she reminding him of it in an effort to assert that intimacy and bring him back from living death bah its interesting to discuss the differences but i cant really fault the production too much its a complicated thing to communicate on screeni agree the dynamic is altered for the show by the staging of that first scene i think the second time we see them have sex in the show is very unlikely to be the second time they have had sex the look of dany in the first scene of the kingsroad suggests that she is having a very difficult time of it for days  weeks by the time she gets pregnant in lord snow she tells irri that she has missed two periods so at least 5 weeks and probably much longer have passed since the wedding nightim surprised to see so much commentary on the snakes i easily rationalized it like this a bunch of alliessuckups are trying to out do each other giving exotic and expensive gifts the snakes produce some precious venom and therefore make a terrific wedding presentnow this was in this episode i also didnt dwell on it either before hearing the commentary im not sure i even had a rationalizationthis post is way too long so ill just cut off there and see if anyone wants to talk to me smilepng classbbcemoticon alt breaking your thoughts down by episode instead of trying to cover the whole season in one go is probably a good way to get them into easier to discuss portions im rewatching the series in anticipation of the second season and have been writing a series of blog posts at gameofthroneswikiacom if youre interested"
"litechick",2012-03-17,"opark thanks for respondingthat must have been a mammoth viewing session if you watched all ten and the commentariesyeah i have a tendency to work with something on the tv so i just keep rolling through them while i did a soldering project smilepng classbbcemoticon alt you are correct and my post was not strictly limited to ep1 i could argue that we see the lift in the opening butstill guiltywhy do you think she wants him to go in the booki agree with your assessment of her motivations the point which i think gets missed by her flip flop is that she is from the south comparatively and she is on board with playing the game in a way that ned is not she knew he was uniquely illsuited to play the game but she sent him anywayshe threw him to the lions if youll pardon the expression to suit her own ambitioneven as i write it out i realize its a petty point to nitpick but for some reason i feel like the show is candycoating her and i would rather let her be judged with all her strengths and flaws intactsame with tywin it changes the essence of the character in order to understand lannister pride you need to understand that he would never lower himself to preparing food for others cause i dont see how he could possibly be planning on eating it all himselfdanydrogonot really worth quibbling about it all worked out in the end its just a shame that the audience missed out on that tender side of him i loved the way the confrontation over the slaves turned out and it goes a long way to mending the initial error"

"TheKassi",2011-04-18,"honestly i am nothing short of ridiculously impressed over how much of the core plot remains unaltered if i compare it to other translations i have seen in the past several years such as the dresden files or sword of truth and i am astounded of the quality of the reproduction the show will not be perfect i would guess as time goes inconsistencies will build upon inconsistencies but heck after watching tonight i would not be surprised if i am proven dead wrong hope hbo picks up more books"
"Tall Tyrion Lannister!",2011-04-18,"i dont think ned loses his head in 3 or 4 episodes once eddard bites the dust theres only enough for one episode really you have the king of the north partsansas ending and dany with the fire so hell probably be dead around episode 9"
"ingsve",2011-04-18,"as far as i can tell eddards death is the cliffhanger for the 9th episode"
"ingsve",2011-04-18,"as for things that were left out then the presenting of the three weapons to dany who refuses them and gives them to drogo instead was left out that makes sense though since not all the bloodriders are cast and also it removes the fact that dany had memorized the custom of refusing the weapons not having that scene makes her look even more uneasy and out of place at the wedding having her actually partake in a ritual like that would have made the tone different they also didnt present her handmaidens to her but that would have just added more characters to introduce and it makes sense to spread things like that out a bit as for things that were added i think it all made good sense i think they might have overdone it a bit with the nudity since some people seem to think it was a bit too much they could easily have covered a few more of them up just so that it wasnt so blatant it would have been enough to show ros and dany i think"
"reiver",2011-04-18,"a few things i noticed changed neds speech to bran about bravery and about how a person who deserts is dangerous which ties in to oshas intro jon dropping trueborn when he says a pup for each of your children robb snapping at theon which seems to put them at odds earlier and also the way it hinted toward theons loyalty being more to ned made them seem less brotherly no nipple twisting from viserys which combined with making dany naked vs the book changed the tone of his abuse of her ned said she was my sister rather than she was a stark when robert complains about burying her in the crypt also ned doesnt mention that he was with her when she died robert says in my dreams i kill him every night which is odd as its not clear who he is or why robert is saying this admittedly neds next line makes it clearer the targaryens are gone but the books line of i vowed to kill rhaegar for what he did to her seems to me a lot better even if they replaced rhaegar for the more nebulous him it would make the scene and what its trying to convey clearer for newcomers giving a bit of history and motivation for only a few words more the link to dany works quite well and could still be included ie ri vowed to kill him for what he did to her nyou did ronly once in my dreams i kill him every night then as in the show i know its a bit nitpicky but hell its the internet and this is one of my favourite scenes in the book and one of the most significant in the whole series as it sets up so much and conveys so much info i love the only once line and it saddens me that this was cut that the scene ended up bookending the horrible tyrion and his whores scene only rubs salt in the wounds chopping up this section is bad enough but it also is very clear what the lines of dialogue were chopped to include yay for nipples sadgif classbbcemoticon alt  any time anyone talks about the difficulty of getting through 80 pages in one episode they need to look at that utterly extraneous excuse for nudity i see no problem with tyrion being introed as he was in the book or at least a combo of that and the arya talking about the imp no wick dipping or hand shitting winkgif classbbcemoticon alt  i missed the conversation bran overhears as it has some nice backstory and a false trail over the death of jon arryn although i suppose that the added cersei jaime scene in kl covered some of that other than the one i went into detail on i didnt really have too many complaints about the adaptation it hit most of the beats i wanted it to ie all dwarves are bastards in their fathers eyes and the additions worked out well the scene between catelyn and cersei was gold and one of my favourite bits from the episode catelyns look when cersei makes the sweet but obviously calculated barbed remark about sansa making her dress sold me on michelle fairley edited by reiver 18 april 2011  0912 am"
"gumby",2011-04-18,"so the king just decided to say fuck my house every banner in the kings party was lannister and not one banner was baratheon this is probably going to confuse a lot of people with no point of reference and the thought that robert would be soooo whipped by cersei that he wouldnt even have one banner that represents his house is kinda of infuriating the no scene was great until they left out dany saying yes"
"Tobin",2011-04-18,"the no scene was great until they left out dany saying yesyeah i had to explain that one to my guests who hadnt read the books the way the scene is cut it implys that he rapes her  but he really doesnt after i explained what was missing my friends were a bit easier with it i had told them this wasnt their normal fantasy show but i think they underestimated how differentwatching the show play out  you realilze just how much subtext is included in the books"
"Social Justice Bass",2011-04-18,"no nipple twisting from viserys which combined with making dany naked vs the book changed the tone of his abuse of herthat was one of the very few things that i thought felt off i like the viserys we see in the show but he really needs to be more unstable and temperamental its part of what made him so unpleasant"
"Huan",2011-04-18,"i missed ghost in the scene between jon and tyrion sounds like theyre using the direwolves less in the show due to training issues but hopefully theyll show ghost going with jon to the wall and presumably nymeria will put in a muchneeded appearance in the next episode"
"juicy b0nes",2011-04-18,"that was one of the very few things that i thought felt off i like the viserys we see in the show but he really needs to be more unstable and temperamental its part of what made him so unpleasanti totally agree when reading the books viserys always seemed unpredictable in that you never knew the next cruel or stupid thing he would do next nipple twisting ftw"
"snookyrump",2011-04-18,"neds big chapter looks to be 7 you win or you die"
"Huan",2011-04-18,"i totally agree when reading the books viserys always seemed unpredictable in that you never knew the next cruel or stupid thing he would do next nipple twisting ftwi was totally dreading actually seeing nipple twisting and much preferred to see him touch her breast that was creepy enough for tv"
"juicy b0nes",2011-04-18,"i was totally dreading actually seeing nipple twisting and much preferred to see him touch her breast that was creepy enough for tvboth are creepy however nipple twisting implies assumed control while touching of breast implies that he just wants to hook up with his sister i did get the sense that he is both attracted to dany and his need to control her at the same time which is good i just think that the nipple twist would have shown the pathetic attempt to find any sort of power over anyone"
"alguien",2011-04-18,"so there were a couple minor changes that made me wonder a few things what was up with the feather that robert put into lyannas statues hand was that just something the writers threw in to give the show a little ambiance or was it some memorial of a time that robert and lyanna went hawking or something sean bean had a lot of prolific scars on his chest was this merely to show how much of a hardened warrior he was or could they be scars from a certain duel at the tower of joy why were the wildling bodies arraigned with a circle slash another addition to up the creepy factor it worked or do the others have some kind of symbolic magic they wanted to work nothing major and im think theyre good either way but some of the changes make me wonder do the creators of the show do them based on info given by grrm or is it just adaptation changes in any event loved the first episode great stuff"
"Rattle Pants",2011-04-18,"quite well done loved the majority of the added scenes shifting cerseis and jaimes conspiring from the love scene to kl was brilliant i thought gave it better pacing though i too got the totally wrong vibe from the no scene im wondering if theyre setting up drogo to be less sympathetic because im not sure how theyll show danys growing affection for him later on after this scene"
"Winterfelled",2011-04-18,"i actually prefer the tv version of the no scene i didnt particularly buy that dany would go from being scared and humiliated to willingly spreading her legs for this horselord at the first glimmer of humanity in him this change makes it a bit more realistic and it doesnt hurt anything going forward even if their relationship is portrayed as more of a captivecaptor which in reality it is it doesnt preclude her from falling in love with him i was very impressed overall with the episode i thought they were faithful in all the right places and their cuts thusfar seem to be for the best"
"Trebla",2011-04-18,"i was expecting the nipple twist but wasnt bothered by the lack of it i thought harry lloyds performance conveyed that viserys isnt all there just his mannerisms portrayed an off feeling he switches from doting brother when he brought her the fabric to creepy as he disrobed her plus his comment that hed let 40000 dothraki have dany for his throne showed he was cruel i also liked his face when illyrio presented dany with the dragon eggs he looked like a child with his feelings hurt"
"Snow White",2011-04-18,"i missed the nipple twist but really just because i was expecting it the gf hasnt read the books and she got the proper this guy is creep vibetyrions banquet seemed odd to me but it does establish his proclivities from jump the drawback is that since its not made clear that theyre whores combined with peters good looks it undermines his ugly dwarf who thinks he has to pay for sex hangup the ranger sinking to his knees in front of the other white walker was a big mistake lots of people the gf included thought that meant he was done for and didnt connect him with the ranger who showed up south of the wall"
"Dremora",2011-04-18,"glad im not the only one who thought it seemed more like rape than in the book"
"reiver",2011-04-18,"tyrions banquet seemed odd to me but it does establish his proclivities from jump the drawback is that since its not made clear that theyre whores combined with peters good looks it undermines his ugly dwarf who thinks he has to pay for sex hangup it was mentioned that it was a whorehouse when jaime came in something along the lines of do you not know what a closed door in a brothel means i agree it didnt come across well and really did nothing more than establish his proclivities with none of the motivation or selfloathing that goes along with it its a really poor scene and i dont get why it was added let alone when"
"Tywin's bastard",2011-04-18,"tyrions banquet seemed odd to me but it does establish his proclivities from jump the drawback is that since its not made clear that theyre whores combined with peters good looks it undermines his ugly dwarf who thinks he has to pay for sex hangupunless one thinks that its common to sleep with normal girls in whorehouses they did make it perfectly clear"
"Xenophon",2011-04-18,"it was mentioned that it was a whorehouse when jaime came in something along the lines of do you not know what a closed door in a brothel means i agree it didnt come across well and really did nothing more than establish his proclivities with none of the motivation or selfloathing that goes along with it its a really poor scene and i dont get why it was added let alone whenyes his oneliner that being the queens brother was his greatest accomplishment was a much better introduction to the character than that whorehouse scene"
"russjass",2011-04-18,"okay so i thought it was good well done within the scope of what they could do we are always going to miss the internal dialogue couple of things felt off and one i may be completely mistaken about maester luwin and catelyn seem to have changed places when discussing ned going south in the book i remember and this is what i may be wrong about maester luwin was taking the there must be a stark in winterfell line while catelyn was urging him to go sout first to gain advantage for himself and a better place for her children in the future and after lyssas letter to discover what the lannisters were up to although mainly to prevent any harm to her children i felt that this established what a hard faced bitch she could be when it came to protecting the kids and led into what she was willing to do later seemed more like a scared woman this way the things i do for love scene was good but didnt feel quite right jaime seemed happy to throw bran off like it was nothing whereas in the book he says it with revulsion when he looks at cersei setting up the lovehate relationship we now know it really is and also paving the way for the character development we see in book three i realise that this is easier to show in a book than on tv but still could have been better other than that agree with a lot of what has already been said tyrions whores and danys rape change the tone slightly there is no real showing yet of what tyrion really is"
"cybroleach",2011-04-18,"well i watched it last night with two friends from work one has read the books and enjoyed it but felt there wasnt enough hook elements in the episode to draw in a new audience epically with so much character jumping my other friend was new to the series and found alot of it boring he did find it shocking with the bran ending i personally felt hbo messed up with a 1hr premier rather than going for a 2hr shot to really get it off to a bang and had to agree about the slow pacing also the one change i really didnt care for is wills escape from the ww it just lets him go as hes cryin on his knees vs the fact that gared rode away like a bat outta hell to escape still very impressive though "

"dylan",2011-04-18,"first of all i loved the first episode i do agree that it didnt have enough of a hook for new viewers like my dad he found it a bit confusing i thought they should have added more of the scene where jon and tyrion first meet and talk as it is one of the best scenes in the series and it portrays more of tyrion that wasnt shown in the episode master luwin wasnt wearing a masters chain too my dad at the end said he was a little disturbed with what im reading which i thought was pretty funny"

"Elrick",2011-04-18,"none of the changes they made bothers me that much mainly because i look at this series as some what removed in someways from the books its just that i feel if you want everything to happen the same way in the shows as the books your just going to be disappointed and will never enjoy the show for what its worth at least in my opinion"

"Tywin's bastard",2011-04-18,"in the novel drogo does take possession of illyrios manse during his wedding that presumably does have a view of the sea as pentos is a port but in truth it mostly had to do with them not having the budget to costume feed and pay 40000 dothraki extraskhal drogo has his own manse in pentos in the novel a gift to make sure the dothraki dont try to attack the city"
"Mandurang",2011-04-18,"one of the visually thematic complaints i have is that the dothraki with the exception of drogo looked more like picts or woads to me than the eurasian equestrian nomads of reallife history i had in my mind that is not to say that dothraki cant look like that in the world of westeros i just had pictured them a little bit differently a very slight complaint and one im guessing most people will not pick up but still is there also i thought the inclusion of roberts flirting with and fondling the serving girls at the feast in winterfell was a little jarring at first why cersei who slammed her drinking horn in his face for not apologizing to her the day after for hurting her in bed and who got up and left the table when the king yelled at her in another occasion would just sit there and look while robert fooled around with a serving wench seemed completely out of character to me until i realized that is that firsttime viewers do not have the luxury of being presented with the backstory and povs like the rest of us who read the books so i guess it kind of makes sense you cant have everything the same was true for tyrions introductory scene firsttime viewers cannot get the story with tysha in the detail we got it so some sort of introduction is required too bad the tone it sets for tyrion is a little off the mark in my opinion however it was a good representation of the novels my socks were not blown off but i reserve the right to be amazed in the future"

"Snow White",2011-04-18,"it was mentioned that it was a whorehouse when jaime came in something along the lines of do you not know what a closed door in a brothel means i agree it didnt come across well and really did nothing more than establish his proclivities with none of the motivation or selfloathing that goes along with it its a really poor scene and i dont get why it was added let alone whenyes it is mentioned but just that once and jaimie brings additional girls into the whorehouse and winterfell has a whorehouse that really doesnt look like a whorehouseive got a suspicion this was a last minute or at least very late additionanother small complaint was the wheelhouse it looks like a gaudy coachandfour i know they have a budget and its really not important but i had heard rumors of some kind of large contraption that made me think it was going to be more impressive edited by snow white 18 april 2011  0705 pm"

"Aoife",2011-04-18,"absurdly off i believe if you got that from imdb i really wouldnt rely on it if nothing else we know hes in the next episode based on previews and he virtually has to be in at least one towards the end of the series so just thinking here about ned spoiler ep 1 weve seen ep 2 we have previews for the rest weve seen scenes of him confronting cersei talking to arya fighting with jaime  co talking to littlefinger and in fact also meeting with cat as a result of lf talking to varys talking to renly fighting with robert as part of the council opening the book jon arrynd been reading and id be very surprised if they didnt actually show him during his last episode so yeah theres virtually no way all of that could be condensed even into one single third episode for him to appear in definitely more than 2 and probably the bulk of the episodes this season id be surprised if there were many at all without him"
"Skittles",2011-04-18,"actually i read it somewhere on this forum but even when i read it it seemed like it would be too hard to accomplish"
"Eponine",2011-04-18,"another small complaint was the wheelhouse it looks like a gaudy coachandfour i know they have a budget and its really not important but i had heard rumors of some kind of large contraption that made me think it was going to be more impressivein the book the wheelhouse is doubledecked and pulled by forty draft horses probably could have been more impressive but i think that following the literal description would have made the thing look ridiculous"

"CryFenril",2011-04-18,"as enthusiastic as i am about the show so far i was very disappointed in the dothraki no rings in the drooping moustachios hardly any mustaches at all comparatively speaking more like a hodgepodge of barbaric peoples than a single consolidated group i too envisioned them much like mongols or huns not like the remains of a diaspora"

"Inglorious Pencil",2011-04-18,"yes it is mentioned but just that once and jaimie brings additional girls into the whorehouse and winterfell has a whorehouse that really doesnt look like a whorehouseive got a suspicion this was a last minute or at least very late additionif i remember correctly that scene was in the very first script that leaked for the pilot except that it was set in kings landing and jaime went to summon tyrion because they had to begin their trip north apparently they wanted to delay tyrions appearance as much as possible though yeah the details of it are a bit murky  i dont think theres a brothel in winterfell i guess we are supposed to assume its someplace down the kingsroad or in a nearby village also i thought the other girls were from the whorehouse as well except that tyrion only hired one and jaime eventually paid for the rest so his lil bro would be done quicker"
"arya_underfoot",2011-04-18,"whats up with jaimes accent it sounds wierd and out of placeanyway catelyns character has been portrayed very differently to what i wouldve expected and whats in the books in the books i thought she was very ambitious and was keen for her children to go to kings landing and for sansa to wed into the royal family i think she even said something along of lines of ned deserving the promotion to hand and the associated prestigeglory etcnone of that comes across instead she wants to stay in the north with her husband and childreni was also very disappointed that tyrion didnt do a reverse somersault when he runs into jon outside the dining hall"
"Damocles",2011-04-19,"it was deeply disappointing that set the tone of the tyrions character by jumping right in and then exaggerating and blowing up his whoremongering hes much more insecure in the novel and it is in other areas that he surprises and excells here hes having a gangbang with jaime in the first twenty minutes"

"The Direwolf",2011-04-19,"i think a little too much is being read into the whorehouse scene i have a feeling throughout the series the insecurities of tyrion will become quite clear and prevalent i think one thing the whorehouse scene did nicely that no one seems to have metioned here is establish the relationship between jaime and tyrion in the book in tyrions pov we see him say how jaime is the only really family member who ever understood him and didnt make him feel bad but we dont have a ton of interaction between the two to actually show that to be the case since the show obviously cant really give us those insights from tyrions pov this type of scene at the very least did a decent job of showing the two brothers have a pretty good relationship despite whatever else may be going on with the lannister family"
"Ser Warpechowski",2011-04-19,"none of the changes they made bothers me that much mainly because i look at this series as some what removed in someways from the books its just that i feel if you want everything to happen the same way in the shows as the books your just going to be disappointed and will never enjoy the show for what its worth at least in my opinioni disagree every single adaptation so far is like that i hoped asoiaf was going to be diferentthey have 10 episodes for a 1000 pages book that is way more than most books get they couldâve had done some things better the great scenes from the book are poorly portrayed on screen the prologue is important it sets the idea that there is some horrible shit going on that no ones know about while humans play their silly power games there was suposed to be some kind of alien inteligent race that mocks humans not a werewolfuruk hai head tossing hybrid who likes to decor using torn pieces of anatomy branâs fall has absolutely no build up and has nowhere near the impact it has on the books imho that is the most impressive scene from the early part of the books and it was poorly donethey couldâve spent more focus on the relationship between the characters and the details from the book instead they layered the grounds for a show that imho will only focus on major political schemes and power strugle while totaly ignoring the small things you know team stark vs team lannistersjust hope it changes in the next episodes and the first one was tailored like that just to catch the audience attention less nudity and more dialogue im also looking to see episode 8 which was directed by grrm edited by ser warpechowski 19 april 2011  0646 am"
"Ser Warpechowski",2011-04-19,"this right here is my one serious complaint of the show while its definitely not something that would keep me from enjoying the series its a big blow because tyrion was always my favorite after ned kicked it at leastin my mind one of the key components for building tyrion lannister is that he has been a tortured individual and while he looks like a monster and is surrounded by real ones within his own family he has a good moral compass hes also a hopeless romantic with a severely wounded heart and possessive nature the careless orgy scene is not fittingits possible that i could imagine that whore house scene playing out in his youth but it does not fit at all with the dwarf i grew to enjoy so much now at allagreed they broke the character alreadyalso the character has got to be the best looking dwarf iâve ever seen i was expecting the oposite i wanted to see a ugly as fck dwarf who limped i mean isnt this hbo i thought they were the ones who could pull it ofthis kind of thing not to mention dany and drogo makes me believe they will dispose of most of the characters details and just go for the whole macro stark vs lannister deal still it was just one episode i guess we will have to wait more"
"Manakhkubar",2011-04-19,"just hope it changes in the next episodes and the first one was tailored like that just to catch the audience attention less nudity and more dialogue im also looking to see episode 8 which was directed by grrmwritten by martin not directed by him i hope i agree they flattened and streamlined a lot so far  which was going to happen no matter what  but i too didnt like the tradeoff of story and fan service ratio in ep1 however i liked how they compressed story and relationships so far and i was positively surprised how they handled some critical scenes"

"Lyri",2011-04-19,"his relationship with shae was unusual between tysha and shae its implied that tyrion goes through any number of whores without forming any real relationship or being dedicated to just one of them at a time he doesnt seek out shae as a longtime companion  he sends bronn to find a random pretty camp follower and comments that hed told bronn to warn the girl he found because there was a look the girls got in their eyes sometimes when they first beheld the lordling theyd been hired to pleasure in other words hes hired a lot of whores but he falls for shae because shes so good at faking love for him this really wouldnt contradict the image of him cavorting with multiple whores before he meets shaefirst off a big hello to everyone i am a newbie here and this is my first post tyrion is by far my favorite character and i really wanted to jump into this discussion because i also viewed the brothelorgy scene to be out of character for tyrion i would not argue against tyrion having hired any number of prostitutes in the past but ive always seen him as having hired one at a time it has always seemed clear to me that tyrion is looking for more than just a sex act from those women hes looking to simulate intimacy with a woman my apologies if this post comes across as a little psych 101ish most of tyrions life seems to have been devoid of true intimacy growing up without a mother with a father who is ashamed and contemptuous of him and a sister who is disgusted by him he is not only a dwarf he is also buttugly even backed by lannister gold i doubt hes spent much if any time wooing noble daughters flirting or pursuing a normal healthy relationship i imagine sansas reaction to him is probably pretty par for his course so whats a rich ugly dwarf to do use that lannister gold to pay prostitutes to play the part not just sex but the whole be there for me when i come home ask me how my day was wifely act and i imagine hes done it again and again almost a fetish in a way so anyways without going on ad nauseum you probably get where im coming from and how im reading tyrion seeing the hbo show throw a gaggle of whores at tyrion made me a little sad to realize how darn much of his depth and nuance is going to go awol in the show particularly since that was tyrions intro to the tv audience ive read a number of reviews that basically assumed tyrion was the drunk lecherous whoremonger who will be there to provide comic relief cry tyrion is much more about pathos than comedy and im hoping that gets developed thanks for letting me ramble carry on smilegif classbbcemoticon alt "

"reiver",2011-04-20,"that scene was added but i think at least some of the dialogue was taken from the scene in the tower that bran overhears just before his fall i admit i was unsold on her as cersei her features are too masculine for the soft looking cersei and she always projects a confidence which is at odds to the book description of her looking vulnerable in short i think she looks too much like cersei would like to be well without the cock that said i liked what ive seen and although itll be different ive got no qualms about her beauty she is an absolutely stunning woman"

"Masha",2011-04-20,"the things i do for love scene was good but didnt feel quite right jaime seemed happy to throw bran off like it was nothing whereas in the book he says it with revulsion when he looks at cersei setting up the lovehate relationship we now know it really is and also paving the way for the character development we see in book three i realise that this is easier to show in a book than on tv but still could have been betterother than that agree with a lot of what has already been said tyrions whores and danys rape change the tone slightly there is no real showing yet of what tyrion really isi thought that brans fall scene was set up pretty good it showed that jaime was clearly reluctant to throw out bran while cercei shrilly demanded that he kill him although when he did push bran off it showed off his ruthlessness and arrogance this is the man that ned found lounging on iron throne with murdered aeris lying next to himi disliked the whores scene the moment i saw it though it was certainly amusing and rather vivid i cant seem to put my finger on precisely why i dislike it it just feels outofcharacter for jaime even if he did hire tyssha for tyrion  or did he and anyway where exactly were theyi thought it was a good scene too it the novels tyrion was always selfdepreciating proclaiming his ugliness and whoring activitess loudly with certain dark humor this establishes him as sort of sarcastic character besides i am not sure why is everyone is claiming that he is not ugly enough in the books he is described as being a dwarf ugly his wounds that ruin his face and make him truly ugly dont happen till end of next bookvery very nice overall even with all the nudity i still think that there was more in the book ie catelyni kind of wish that catelyn was still the one that convinces eddard to go southalso im really disappointed that drogo wasnt gentle and kind with danyhttpasoiafovrnitckquotespani am not sure that drogo raped her at the end the scene closed out with her collapsing on her knees anyhow its pretty much impossible to be extremely faithful to the book and movie to tv series because the show will suffer for it in quality and pace while book fans will probably love it new viewers will not this is probably as faithful as one can get with tv or movies"
"Chataya de Fleury",2011-04-20,"re  the whorehouse scene i am in the camp that says hey this is establishing tyrions character because until he hooks up with shae we have only heard that he frequents whores as viewers we need to be shown not told and they may change a lot of things  shae may or may not make an appearance i know for sure talking with george in minneapolis last year during days of ice and fire that chataya will not be in the show and hence maybe not alayaya later on anyways  did anyone see tommen myrcella or rickon"
"Aoife",2011-04-20,"i saw tommen and myrcella getting out of the coach i think rickon was in the archery scene and then alongside catelyn while greeting robert im sure they were all at the feast somewhere as well but i think theyre more clearly seen at other times"

"The_Halfhand",2011-04-22,"first off i just want to say that as a diehard fan of the books i will support this show in any way that i can however there are a lot of changes they made to the show which just make no sense to me especially when the book nailed them so perfectly 1 the changes to the prologue switching the two characters of gared and will isnt that big of a deal to me but the imagining of the others and the death of weymar royce was the fight between royce and the other while his companions looked on and then royces resurrection as a wight communicated so many things  the nature of the nights watch and the threat of the others i also think they introduced the wall too early its going to take some of the impact out of it when jon and tyrion first arrive and see it for the first time 2 the chances to the direwolf scene honestly the changes they made to this scene baffle me it was nailed perfectly in the book all they had to do was translate the lines to the screen instead they totally gut the symbolism of the scene and the relationships of the brothers neds reaction in the show to the keeping of the pups was so out of character it was cringeinducing 3 jon arryns funeral i feel like the adding of this scene takes a lot of the intrigue out of the early portion of the story this is stuff thaqt could have been communicated at the end of the episode where it was supposed to be 4 the haircut scene honestly why was this scene in the show theon robb and jon getting haircuts and saying the prince is a royle prick then they say sheer him good in relation to jon but the next scene his hair looks exactly the same brilliant 5 the kings arrival why they made the changes here is another big question the stuff with arya chattering on clumsy exposition like wheres the imp and thats jamie lannister the queens twin brother was horrid seriously they couldnt think to come up with a more clever way to communicate that information and sanas shut up constantly being repeated was a bit out of character sansa is always so well mannered in the books except when pushed publically by arya 6 the crypt scene there was so much that could have been communicated in the crypt scene between robert and ned with the addition of a few simple lines again they seemed to be changed needlessly 7 dannys bath anyone else think the no milady its too hot line was handled poorly how hard would it have been to have danny say something about her liking the heat 8 tyrions introduction the scene where they introduce tyrion was horrible just horrible first off they present him as being far more leterchous than he is in the books and much of his dialogue in that scene made very little sense id rather they would have kept his introduction short and gave him his full interaction with jon at the feast as his first intro to the audience 9 lack of direwolves the direwolves play such a huge roll in the books and here they are completely marginalized especially concerning jon snow and ghost 10 jon snows scene during the feast jon is coming of as way more petulant than he was in the books hes sooooooo emo no interaction with ghost and his first scene with tyrion was so mishandled it captured none of the budding friendship that was there in the book very disappointing with the changes made there the lines about tyrions birth killing his mother and jon never knowing his mother were kinda important and yet nowhere to be heard 11 dannys rape scene i thought that it was terrible how danny never got the freedom rush of riding her horse through her wedding and then eventually submitted herself to drogo which was all very important to her development in the books here shes just scared scared scared and then raped totally sets the wrong tone for her character who is much more active in the novels 12 the things i do for love finally the final line that jamie delivers was soooooo poorly done in the books he goes to help bran until his sister says what are you doing only then does he ask bran his age and then pushes him off the tower by saying  with loathing  the things i do for love obviously no one on the production staff bothered to read the book before shooting that scene jamie isnt a bad character cerci is and he did what he thought she wanted him to do even though he hated it a common thread for jamie who had to put up with the crazy stuff king areys did so did i hate the show no i didnt hate it but i didnt love it as much as i should have because of the silly changes that were made ill keep watching and i hope theyll get better about sticking to the important stuff in the novels but it really upsets me that these little nuances that made the series so enjoyable were changed for the show without any good reason for doing so"

"The_Halfhand",2011-04-22,"to be honest i am a little surprised at all the wailing about the dany scene especially amongst those who have read the books multiple times while that scene is very touching in the books right after that drogo does start raping here every day to the point that dany considers killing herself the way they have done it in the series will make a lot more sense especially to those new to the books because as their love grows it will seem more believable and be a better overall arcalso a lot of the dialogue that people are missing so much may actually have been filmed and cut down in editing it will be very interesting if there is a possibility of directors cuts of the shows on bluray it would really help to sell them and be a great gift to fansshe considers killing herself because of a number of things not just the rape saddle sores culture shock etc but to me i felt that danny submitting to drogo was a huge character moment because next to the riding her horse through the wedding its the first time we see her stop being afraid and take some initiative if they had just showed her taking a little control in the consummation scene i think it would have set the stage for her character better and for drago too i dont mind the other liberties they took with dannys scenes but i felt that yes moment she had with drago was extremely important to her development as a character in the books and could have easily been included in the showits possible some dialogue hit the cutting room floor but little bits of dialogue go a long way in communicating to the audience the important bits of backstory that make the books so rich i mean the part about tyrion and jon snow not knowing their mothers was kinda important in the books since it set up tyrions relationship with his sister and father and the fact that jon doesnt know anything about his mother which will eventually come into play later in the seriesso i dont mind the producers making changes but a lot of the changes they decided upon rob the story of a lot of the richness the books have i think thats my biggest gripe"

"Anduck",2011-04-23,"1 the changes to the prologue i also think they introduced the wall too early its going to take some of the impact out of it when jon and tyrion first arrive and see it for the first timei agree with this its such a great moment in the book when we first see the wall with jon if they do it right it could still work however4 the haircut scene8 tyrions introductionhonestly why were these scenes in the showits often stated that it is difficult to adapt the text into the time available that said it seems odd to insert scenes that to my mind have little apparent purpose6 the crypt scene again they seemed to be changed needlesslyi actually thought they handled the scene pretty well as you say though it could have that much better9 lack of direwolvesthe direwolves play such a huge roll in the books and here they are completely marginalized especially concerning jon snow and ghosti think i read somewhere that they had some trouble training them definately would have been good to see ghost more though10 jon snows scene during the feast the lines about tyrions birth killing his mother and jon never knowing his mother were very important and yet nowhere to be heardthese sould have included im sure they could have found some time to add a couple of lines12 the things i do for lovei was very worried beforehand how that would be delivered but i actually liked it quite alot he unfortunately didnt say it with loathing but it could have been much worse so im happy"

"La Piccola Fiamma Verde",2011-04-17,"i watched it with my dad i tried getting him to read the books ages ago but he never really got past the beheading of the deserter throughout the episode it was fun to watch his reactions to different things the kings that big fat guy whys he married to the queen shes so hot i guess they are the ones who there arent supposed to be any left of  at the intro of dany and viserys hey that kids not supposed to be climbing cool dire wolves countless whos thats and what does that means it looks pretty good i think that he was pretty confused through most of it though and probably would have stopped watching if he didnt know that i have been waiting ages for this plus fantasy is not really his thing that said i looked over at him as it ended after the things i do for love bit and he had this huge grin and was all starry eyed and just said that was wrong on every possible levelokay so maybe that was pretty good we can watch it instead of spartacus then when i came down stairs he was making lunch and talking to my little brother who didnt watch with us and i caught the end of the convo which was but wouldnt it be cool to have a pet dire wolf so all and all i think it went pretty well thumbsupgif classbbcemoticon altthumbsup  and once he figures out who the characters are im pretty sure that hell be hooked edited by la piccola fiamma verde 17 april 2011  1157 pm"

"Areo",2011-04-18,"i loved the opening credits they are a work of art not spectacular with knights and scenery but very well made i watched them 23 times and it is obvious how much care went into making them i dont know what you guys expected but it looks really good and besides serves a purpose this time i liked wills beheading better in the 14 minute preview the blood looked more fake like a ton of red paint while here it was much more believable i compared them and maybe its just me but theyve improved on that scene also in some of the previews when bran runs on the walls of the castle there was a moment that was obviously cgi and it was ok here so basically the visual part was perfect the score could have been stronger but i think we complain about it mostly because the other elements are exquisite and not that the music is weak itself the dothraki wedding was a bit odd which is to confirm all the reviews ive read reently other than that the sex was well placed i didnt feel like it was overdone certainly not more prominent than in the books and not really in greater quantities than in other quality shows without rating issues to consider as to many questions i read here people unfamiliar with the books asked i found many clues in the dialoge and i guess with later episodes and reruns things will get clearer besides hbo has a guide on their site to help in such cases where there is the basic info and without the danger of walking into a massive spoiler zone overall it was a feast for my eyes and i loved it too bad there is a whole week till the next one edited by areo 18 april 2011  0352 am"
"reiver",2011-04-18,"i dont think theres more sex in this than the books if thats your complaintthe problem for me was the way the sex scenes were shot not the amount of sex the camera panning down to make sure all of emilia clarkes buttocks were in the shot then the prolonged way she took the steps to the bath for example i think they were going for it being almost ceremonial but the tone theyd set was pornographic and by that point it seemed just an excuse to have a five fingered shuffle while the book isnt always decorous it didnt go into prolonged descriptions of danys sumptuous breasts etc in the first few pages and when we have had more fully described sex scenes it was about the story with one major exception ive no real problem addong these scenes to help establish characters and ill admit theyre all relatively in character but they felt more about showing tits and in the shaving scene abs than the personalities inolved almost like hbo have a nipple quotient this was largely what turned me off true blood so i hope it doesnt do the same ironically two of three scenes where nudity was involved in the books during this portion catelyn in her bedchamber being naked infront of maester luwin and cersei with jamie were done fully clothed the cat one at least was a real part of her character building edited by reiver 18 april 2011  0421 am"

"AquariumDrinker",2011-04-18,"the desire to turn as you so aptly put it a damned near perfect book into something that needs to turn a profit on the television screen is only going to not have the life and luster that it so deserves that is always the unfortunate aspect of large budget productions they are always seen as an investment by the people with the money and never as a work of art i think that is why they were only given 10 episodes when 12 or a 2 hour pilot would have made a huge difference keep in mind that the pilot was shot twice and footage from both were used to make what we saw i think there were some unfortunate inconsistencies but there have been other shows that look a bit different from the pilot once the series gets underway"
"Ser Greguh",2011-04-18,"i think part of the reason for my admiration of the show is because i dont look at the book as anything even remotely close to perfect someone who holds the book up in such an extreme imo impossibletoliveupto admiration is probably not going to respond positively to anything that is different im not trying to crap on the book or anything i think its absolutely incredible one of the best ever written in the genre but my own personality is such that i will always find flaws no matter how great i think something is acknowledging that its a very different medium and that many of the changes are obviously the direct result of those differences i still think that many of the changes that have been made are actually for the better i think the scene between jon and tyrion for example is considerably better on the screen that chapter is always something of a difficult read as though martin hadnt fully figured out his characters and drifted entirely too purple and perhaps his only slips into pseudoomniscience in his prose both the first episode of the show and the first 100 or so pages of the novel are essentially a stylized infodump they have to be its just that its far easier to infodump in an eloquent way on the page as compared to on the screen i think that on any objective standard the show accomplished what it needed to accomplish with incredible skill as with other completely serialized shows the wire  a very positive comparison  jumps to mind the only truly fair way to judge the show will be once the entirety of the season has been viewed the season is really just one single dramatic unit im predicting it holds up very well"

"reiver",2011-04-19,"theres no way the new viewer could grasp the importance of the rebellion or the targaryens just yet and i really dont see why it would be important to do so though the scene with robert insisting on paying his respects to lyanna did a lot to introduce her name as somebody special a very casual viewer wouldnt think much on it but a very casual viewer would miss a great deal of things with any great dramathis was the scene that was particuarly poorly handled imo i accept the change of medium and the differences that entails but this scene was dialogue heavy in the book with very little happening inside neds head and i dont think that it needed to be changed as they did in the show im fine with cutting back on some details and not overburdening viewers with a history lesson and a barrage of names but they took an axe to it and left it more obscure there comes a point where if youre cutting almost all the meat from a scene whats the point even having the scene this bit also worried me about the way the producers view their audience shows like the wire deadwood and rome had no problem having long scenes with lots of dialogue because for the most part they didnt talk down to their viewers here i got the impression that cutting back on some important stuff like hinting at what the hell happened to lyanna and who this he that robert kills in his dreams wasnt enough they decided the viewers needed a comedy visit to a brothel and some tits to keep their interestmaybe im reading too much into that but i was certainly worried by the approach generally which failed to match the mature tone of the books"
"Tywin's bastard",2011-04-19,"to the ts as people have already said as long as the book is good an adaptation will never reach it in quality even less when the book is as long and complicated as agot i dont really see why your opinions required its own thread instead of joining it with everyone elses in the already existing discussions though personally i definitely disagree on acting and i do think the show looked great overall any individual imperfections are not worth dragging up if the vast majority is good in general it sounds like its a mix of that things just doesnt suit you and that you have had unrealistic expectations reiver then you had a different view than mine i think the show goes very far from underestimating the audience quite the contrary they put a ton of information in the first episode and it takes someone not too stupid to get all of that if they prolong one thing they will basically have to cut something out entirely the reason things are shorter is because they have so little time"

working on that book when suddenly the first chapter of a games of thrones not the prologue but the first chapter came to me the scene of the dire wolves in the summer snow i didnt know where it came

"theMaC",2011-04-19,"i dont want to sound like an apologist because i am a very critical person especially of things i lovebut this is only a pilot and traditionally a lot of shows have weaker and rushed pilots because they arent so much meant for the audience theyre meant to get a tv studio to decide if they want to invest in producing an entire series based on the premises laid out in the pilotfor that reason some of the errors are forgivable i really think this should have been a two hour finale and that would have given them all the time they needed to not screw up a lot of the things they did the direwolves scene is a terrible disappointment and it isnt bad because it differs from the books but because its inferior it almost seems tacked on just because its clear here that the mystery of jon arryns death is what they are framing to be the central plot line hes our laura palmerso stuff like the direwolves who are terribly important over time kinda have to get down played cause thats not the hook they want to throw which is disappointing and a lot of it could have been alleviated by showing all the stark kids with their direwolves throughout the show the fact that lady die next episode and nymeria is driven off and we havent even seen them with the kids yet is crappy there should have been an effort to have the direwolves around jon not having ghost with him at the feast was crappy tooso we just have to hope that going forward with the knowledge that they have x amount of time to tell this entire story things will be better paced and more polishedand hopefully have a lot less of the talking down to the audience like were moronshonestly cat pulling bran aside and being like young man climbing is dangerous blah blah token emotional sentiment blah blah telegraphs the fall so bad edited by themac 19 april 2011  0339 pm"

"Glow",2011-04-20,"i really think is not possible to translate a book a great book in this case into film and get a final product which keeps up to the book for all the readers it could keep up for an hypothetical reader and maybe it could get close to what creatives involved in the making of the film got out from the book but theres no way it could match the personal universes of each reader along the world a writer creates a castle of words which we as readers inhabit we bring our own memories to this castle we put a lot of ourselves how we see the world things we enjoy our own personal feelings at the time things weve seen things weve lived through and then well books we read and how we felt through all that my own adaptation of the book changed in time as my personal point of view on things changed some characters i understand now why i just cant stand them and that understanding is helping me sorting out some things i think ill live better if rid of a book is a universe or at least it has the potential to be one and each reader will have a personal reference coding which is not just about the words and the grammar but about how we feel their flow how sometimes one thing just pours into another making totally impossible to leave that world because while we are reading we finish forging it and doing it makes us part of a creative process which has no end for every single reader there will be a different shade of blond for the lions e distinct presence for starks a personal definition of targs and so on because what i think is glorious red hair or and imperious look or a broad shouldered guy and thats that wonderful things books can deliver i love some choices arya ned bran tyrion for a start and i dont understand others because they are quite far from what i had in mind catelyn for a start but robert doesnt look a bit as i thought he would and cersei does not have what i would call golden hair but im sure i will live happy with it anyway for the others i always found descriptions of monster far more realistic and terrifying than any monster on screen probably because the horrors i can imagine are for me a lot worse than any already cooked up monster around so i wasnt really into a high expectations mood i didnt get why they changed that though im just happy the series is there and i really want to get into reading adwd and i have this blinding hope whispering to me that if martin signed a contract with hbo then maybe i wont be waiting a lifetime for the next book"
"TheBigTEA",2011-04-20,"so i am not here to complain really because i have to say i am so excited that they are doing this and for 2 seasons no less the actor who plays benjen looks exactly like i thought eddard should look likeexactly i have no problem with bean as ned but that guy is perfect the girl who they got to play arya also looks just like my head arya the only complaint i really have is the dothraki sceneit should have been just crazy and mad with a hundred thousand peoplebut i know why they didnt do it"

"Rinso",2011-04-21,"well the books would always be the best to me but i think that this first episode was a heroic effort that played very well the first time i watched it the pace felt rushed to me and some scenes a bit underdeveloped but in subsequent rewatchs it got better the episode got right more things than it did wrong and for the most part luckily it got right the important stuff and dropped the ball only on minor issues doesnt mean i dont have complaints  still wish they had salvaged the wedding scene between dany and drogo the prologue is a mess and the direwolves were but all but nonexistant but everything else was as good as it could have been i think that the show will get even better and hopefully it will remain faithful to the books"
"Jo498",2011-04-21,"i agree with all who disliked the direwolf scene this was bad in many respects the children should find the wolves before ned and the others catch up and it was over too fastthe brothel scene with tyrion was completely superfluous that time should have been used for other things eg a longer direwolf finding or maybe arya and sansa receiving their pups after the party gets hometheon is unexplained for the ones who do not know the book altogether i am not sure if a lot is quite confusing for people not familiar with the books its probably to oldfashioned and wouldnt be true to the books either but at some place a narrator wouldnt have been to badthe intro with the map was pretty good for some background info and it also plays on the game metaphor i think that was well donei liked the fact that jon was completely excluded from the feast or chose to do so rather than sitting with the sevants because to get these distinctions right would have been difficult or required a much longer feast scenebrans fall was quite bad as well imo in the book the twins are actually nude and at foreplay while talking in a treacherous way i always found it important that what bran heard was at least as dangerous as what he saw he did not really understand what they were doing and it takes too long its almost premeditated murder not a rather spontaneous actthe dany scenes were ok i guess again the strange relationship to drogo is not easy to get across ser jorah could have been introduced a little earlier with more background not enough info for nonreaders againbut i think drogo and the dothraki are rather messed up altogether i understand that their barbaric nature has to come across but they do wear vests in the books not eyeshade the drogo guy seems a nonactor to medragon eggs were not beautiful enoughand illyrio was way too serious completely understated this guy should be jabbalike obese with a coulored beard and covered in jewelry altogether rather repulsive at least ambiguous not like a nice unclecompared to drogo the dothraki and illyrio i think the westerosi cast is just fineall in all i am not as thrilled as i hoped i would be but i am one of those guys who hardly ever like a movietv adaption i never watched the 3rd part of lotr because i found the 2nd so bad these books are simply too epic to get even half the important things that make them special across on the screen"

"JaimeKingSlaya",2011-04-21,"i see where the op is coming from especially since i am a long time reader of the series as well about 11 years however i never entertained any notions that the tv series would be anything close to the books one of my friends is such a purist that he wont even watch the series with the being said it is kind of awkward seeing it on screen after having these characters in your head for so long ive reread the series so many times that they are almost like old friends so i had to watch it a couple more times before i was comfortable with it i really did like the show after getting over the initial awkwardness cersie and jaime where pretty much how i imagined them as far as tyrion goes i will always imagine the ugly dwarf with the mismatched eyes and a beard but i can live with the guy they have playing him because he did a pretty good job ned is perfect i know the actor is older then ned in the books but he can easily pass as someone in his mid to late thirties that has been through a lot and has a lot of cares i only really have a couple of small problems with the first episode of the adaption and none of them are a big deal except one thing which i will mention in the next paragraph ive heard a lot of the criticism of catelyn being to old and i can see why i found the whole character to be a little bit off especially with her chat with cersie over dinner and her trying to stop ned from beheading the deserter i can live with this catelyn though since i did not really like the one in the books lol the actress they found to play arya is perfect but i didnt like the whole archery thing one bit arya shooting the arrow over brans head while cat and ned sit there and smile was not really the culture of the stark family at this stage they where still trying to make arya into a lady at this point i remember how uncomfortable ned was when he discovered needle so i dont know how they will deal with that when the time comes cant really bulk at letting the girl have a sword when they acted like her shooting a bow with great accuracy was perfectly normal especially at an angle where an inaccurate shot could have taken one of her brothers in the back of the head if its okay for her to just show up in her dress and start shooting arrows right by her brothers head then i guess she should just ask ned for a sword instead of having jon give her one in secret having her shoot a bow perfectly right of the bat is what i would expect to see in a robert jordan book im a fan of rj dont get me wrong i really hope they dont screw up aryas character development to bad because she was one of my favorite characters other then that the arya character was done well and they did a good job capturing her personality the scenes involving the targaryen exiles where excellent and the casting is perfect for all the roles involved opening scene was changed a little bit to make it faster which is good however i agree with a previous poster that said the wolf scene should have been done verbatim from the books it would have been a lot more powerful winterfell and kings landing are exactly how i envisioned them the ending with brans fall was well done i disagree with the op on this point i thought the delivery was perfect so overall as a long time reader of the series i enjoyed the show i give the first episode a 9 of out 10losing a whole point for arya doing archery the rest was either extremely well done or at least okay"

"Eponine",2011-04-21,"good point it would be dakota fanning all over againis it possible that our concept of 13 years old is different from that of a fantasy realms 13 we dont kno if a year is 365 days in the 7 kingdoms do we a year could be 500 days in the 7 kingdomsgirls seem to reach puberty around 1214 which is pretty similar to modern teenagers it seems that the attitude was that girls could be married as soon as they went through puberty but in westeros it would be more normal at least for highborn girls to have a few more years before being considered women maybe im mistaken about that but i think i picked up that 1517 was more usual edited by eponine 21 april 2011  0845 pm"
"CuseGirl",2011-04-21,"girls seem to reach puberty around 1214 which is pretty similar to modern teenagers it seems that the attitude was that girls could be married as soon as they went through puberty but in westeros it would be more normal at least for highborn girls to have a few more years before being considered women maybe im mistaken about that but i think i picked up that 1517 was more usuali get that i just meant in regards to emilia clarke appearing too old to play dany who is supposed to be 14 in the book it would be in poor taste for hbo to actually have even a 16 year old play that character on screen also our concept of time may not be the same in the story so danys 14 could be our 18 for all we knough seeing these previews makes me want to read the book all over again cuz i kno i missed things"
"TerraPrime",2011-04-21,"so danys 14 could be our 18 for all we knoi dont think this explanation works as weve had no indications from other characters and events that time passes differently in westeros they have odd lengths for season but time passes at the same rate as our world as far as we know"
"Whitering",2011-04-22,"there were a few things that stood out for me lets start with the starks 1 theon doesnt come across as being as big of an asshole as in the books i hated him from the moment they found the direwolves but in the show he was barely noticeable 2 i may be mistaken but was the brothel in which the tyrion and jaime scene took place in winterfell because that doesnt seem right to me at all 3 arya came across wonderfully but ya ned and cat would not smile at her behaviour 4 i dont think cat looks older than ned but she is no great beauty either there is a problem with aging them up but if you want sean bean i guess it had to happen i dont think shes pretty enough for littlefinger to go after as to dany 1 her brother is not as mean but then nobody can sympathize with a sociopath so i guess thats okay 2 her wedding was all fucked up no fantastic ride of silver thus no bonding with the dothraki 3 no tender moment with drogo made her wedding night massively uncomfortable for a huge number of people thats on top of the fact that it wasnt exactly made clear by the show that dany was well resigned to the fact she had to have sex that night even if she was scared i dont know it did not sit well with me overall i enjoyed the show even though the book was way better as an avid reader i already visualize the books as i read them so the show is redundant and a bit disturbing but they got arya and tyrion right so i will keep watching 1 minute of dany riding silver with breathless excitement would have made the show for me alas nothing is perfect well outside of the books themselves"

"Guest_Raids_*",2011-04-22,"yeah its occurred to me that we will probably get a more and more haggard cat until the assassination attempt at which point they may change the look a bit for the trip to the capitol a think a bigger problem that i have is that cat always seemed like she would be really regal in demeanor to me and thats not really how the actress acts or holds herself on the show so far its not that i think she should be prettier or anything as i think the actress is very pretty as far as that goes i just think should look more imposing and noble and less like a very attractive hardworked farm wife i just cant see the scene with her and jaime in the dungeon either just watched the last scene again and the delivery of the line seems overly quick but what bothers me the most is that jaime just gives bran a sort of casual shove as hes turning around where as i always thought he grabbed his shirt or something and pitched him out the window a little more forcefully also were jaime and cersei really getting it on in some kind of storage attic or something i thought they were supposed to be in someones rooms edited by raids 22 april 2011  0846 am"

"Eponine",2011-04-22,"i may be wrong but i dont think it matter whether you are highborn or not as too what age you are married at in acok i remember sansa having her period and it meant that she was ready for marriage so its got more to do with when you hit puperty then your agebut sansa was quickly forced into marriage and not by her own family when the betrothal is made to joffrey initially the attitude seems to be that the marriage would be several years in the future not as soon as sansa is physically capable lyanna was 16 and unmarried cersei was probably 17 when she married robert jaime was 15 when he joined the kg lord frey has several daughters who are past puberty but not yet married margaery was 15 or 16 when she married renly the citidel faq says that cat was 17 or 18 when littlefinger challenged brandon  anyway there are several accounts of girls being married in their midteens but almost the only examples in the books of girls being married at 1213 are where they are being rushed or forced into it"
"Brienne the Beauty",2011-04-22,"anyway there are several accounts of girls being married in their midteens but almost the only examples in the books of girls being married at 1213 are where they are being rushed or forced into iti think this is how it goes the more stressed and threatened the noble families feel the younger they tend to marry off their children this makes sense from their point of view in desperate times bonds between noble families need to be strong and marriage is the easiest way to create bonds thus little tommen gets married to a girl twice his age to cement the vital alliance between their two families this wouldnt have happened in happier times marrying children too young to have children of their own or girls barely old enough to bear children with all the health risks that involves seems to be something the noble houses generally avoid without absolutely pressing reasons to do so since the war is causing increasing amounts of pressing reasons there is a lot more of it than usual"
"Callie",2011-04-22,"i agree that the book is better but they nearly always are i really enjoyed the show however with a two major compaints and a few minor quibbles my first disappointment was in the wedding night scene with dany and drogo in the book it turned into something tender and not a rather coldseeming rape that we saw in the show i think this is a mistake as drogo made danny love him that night and without that love her decisions and future would be different im hoping that we see something better from this scene in the next episode or at least some kind of patch that we will then understand her loving him the second thing was the handling of arya who is a favorite of mine in the book she was not a showoff the archery scene in the show or a brat flinging food at sansa in the show instead of showing her frustration at her own unsuitability to be a lady because shes really such a tomboy like with her poor needlework they chose to make her naughty yes shes headstrong in both and the actress is fine in the role also in the third book there is a scene where she wishes she had a bow and the skill to use it a minor detail maybe but i just read it and it stood out to me im hoping we see more of the conflict and frustration she feels at her position also without the needlework scene her naming the sword needle has less significance as for quibbles theyre pretty minor people here have been talking about the womens hair being done or up or not its a fantasy whos to say but the author how the women wear there hair my trouble isnt with the style its with the lack of it on jaime and a few others not only that but the color isnt nearly the golden blond i expected jaime and cersei and their children were supposed to have long wavy golden hair and wheres tyrions beard the direwolf scene change was annoying because it was so different without any reasonable reason i could see i understand about budgetary reasons for the lack of horses the lack of great grass plains but the whorehouse scene with tyrion was unnecessary oh and the white walkers seemed anything but white to me what was up with that but overall i loved it and am really looking forward to the next episode"
"Bronn Stone",2011-04-22,"the second thing was the handling of arya who is a favorite of mine in the book she was not a showoff the archery scene in the show or a brat flinging food at sansa in the show you have juice on your face your grace"

"Humble Asskicker",2011-04-23,"theres some things the book does better and some things that the show does better some things work both ways but are different the show is better in these respects  the prologue far superior in the show the book was kind of lame about it it was a cheesy horror scene with some sword play thrown in not scary not eerie made the others come off as kind of banal in the show it was intense it opened up with a fantastically somber beautiful shot of the wall and the forest the dismembered bodies were visually remarkable  particularly the symbolic arrangement  more so than just some dudes laying around the wildling child was creepy as hell and the others were distant figures hardly on screen at all which made them far more intriguing and menacing i realize people are complaining that it doesnt make sense that the others would dismembered their wights or they would let one of the nights watch rush off after taunting him but this are silly complaints no one knows anything about the others at this point the show may in retrospect make more sense than the book we dont know  the beheading i like the guys speech it made him more sympathetic  viserys rather annoying and simplistically villainous in the book far better done in the show  the characters being aged up its just more believable  danys rape in the book this is pretty ridiculous some thirteen year old girl who is sold off to those she considers barbarians after witnessing all manner of violence and rape is not going to get turned on because her husband bothers to do a little foreplay first that just wouldnt happen i think the show is more true to the human character  the head kick when theon kicks the head eddard should have bitched slapped him in the books it seems strange and out of character that he let that pass its better to do without it  cersei opinions may differ here but i prefer watching a character thats not a stereotype evil stepmother and a stupid one at that the show cersei is more interesting things the show definitely did worse the dothraki wedding dothraki warriors frolicking about in merry dance and battling over who gets to dry hump whom just didnt do it for me high cheese factor here edited by humble asskicker 23 april 2011  1251 pm"
"Daenerys",2011-04-23,"pretty good defense of the show choices humble asskicker i mostly agree with those except i did think the book prologue was eerie and prefered it to the tv version i also really think the tv show didnt suitably emphasize the importance of the direwolves and their connection to the stark children we dont even see arya or sansa receiving theirs maybe it will but with spoiler lady already likely getting offed in the next episode and nymeria being chased away  it doesnt seem like there would be enough time but yeah i did think the tv show did some things right i agree that danys rape which not accurate to the books is probably more realistic although i do think omitting her important ride on the horse was a mistake theres a lot of criticism of the crypt scene between ned and robert but i loved that scene in the show it was perfect and memorable for me loved the addition of arya shooting the arrow and sneaking off in a helmet to watch the lannisters enter winterfell and i liked the forshadowing of dany walking slowly into the too hot bath"
"tuthmoses",2011-04-24,"mc i agree with your assessment that the pace seemed off i mean to us the readers of the novel a lot of the exposition was just that however i totally saw something different in the tower scene the way jaime delivered the line as flippant and casual and matter of fact was more chilling than the books version where he said it with loathing im rewatching the scene now and cersei is frantic saying he saw us he saw us jaime replies with a bit of loathing i heard you the first time then you see his resolve he knows what he has to do hes got to act to protect his family their secret i thought it was a great delivery if you cant tellagree with this thought the line was delivered very well  and to the op of course its not as good as the book the book is one of the greatest things ever written but it is still very good and beats the hell out of anything else on tv and infact i would go so far as to say in some areas such as the prologue it is better than the book edited by tuthmoses 24 april 2011  0136 pm"

"rigochu",2011-04-27,"i would have liked to have had the prologue be more like the books basically ser waymar royce being kind of a douche in the begining of the prologue and then showing some redeeming qualities right before he gets hacked to death by the others is kind of foreshadowing for the rest of the entire series i know this show will probably have time constraint issues but they went in a diff direction entirely besides the pacing issues this was my biggest qualm"
"red snow",2011-04-29,"just caught up on the show i was on holiday and i was quite pleased with it some of the cast are instantly standing out for me arya theon viserys almost wish they had cast the actor as someone else as hes great and of course tyrion i thought jason momoa was being underused but hopefully thats intentional so that we can see that he is not as bad as he initially seems the tv show is making him far leass sympathetic already i was worried though that people who havent read the books may be confused though something i found happening in later installments of the potter films i may not notice as i can fill in the gaps with the books as a control ever the scientist i asked my brother who has never read the books what he thought two episodes in and he thinks its good a bit like rome and that the dwarf is good seems like the show is doing things right in that respect my major grumble is with the intro which is excellent aside from the clockwork building of cities i find that really irksome as to me it screams steampunk which is nothing at all like the technology present in westeros i think this would confuse even nonfantasy readers as well"
"Talan Snow",2011-05-18,"but once again perhaps i just expected too muchyes you were expecting too much its a miniseries of a very involved and great book it has to be judged on its own merits if you cant do that best to just not watch it i guess"

"Second Son",2012-01-17,"i agree completely with the original post in this thread ive got some thoughts regarding the series and this seems to be the right thread for them the television adaptation is destined to be a pale imitation of the majestic story us readers know very well for that reason ive boycotted the tv show and not seen a single episode ive been disappointed too many times by movies in a selfish sort of way i wish grrm had refused hbos offer on on the one hand its good that many of my friends are finally reading a song of ice and fire only because of the hype generated by tv ive been telling them about this sage for nearly 15 years and now i can finally talk to someone else at work about the adventures of these complex characters also i can say i told you so hopefully the increased interest in the story will stimulate the author to do his very best in finishing the work to the best of his abilities furthermore who can blame grrm for cashing in on all the creative work he has done he must have known his story beats the pants off of harry potter why not make a lot more money with sales stimulated through hbo even if the tv series is terminated before telling the full story it will have some redeeming aspects but on the other hand i think there are serious disadvantages to the tv series i dont see how one can adequately tell the back story which becomes more and more important as the series advances especially as it motivates the actions of many characters to the reader the unfolding real time story and the backstory of roberts rebellion can both be imagined with equal vividness however viewers of the tv series will be robbed of the back story characters can reminisce or have flashbacks but those will fall short in communicating the story for this reason i think many viewers will judge the story too harshly finally i dont think a lot of people will watch a story to which they already know the ending the noninvested fans will leave the tv series because it is too heartbreaking or too complicated while the invested fans will know exactly what is going to happen in each episode unfortunately i think the fervor around the tv series will fade soon after the second season"

"BryceC",2011-04-18,"this is my first post here and if i come off as a flamer i apologize i have read all of the books several times and i do truly enjoy the universe grrm created and i eagerly await the conclusion of the series that said i am a little surprised at the high praise of the show i watched it yesterday since we got a free weekend of hbo as a directv subscriber honestly i have very little desire to watch the rest of the season i checked how much time was left on the dvr recording probably five times because it was borderline boring for me granted i knew the story but like others have said i would be completely confused by it if i had never read the books also it just lacked the polish of a show like rome i felt like they wasted some time that would have been better used on character development etc i couldnt honestly tell jon robb and theon apart it just didnt suck me in and as somebody who is thirsty for any ice and fire stuff i thought i would drink this right up but i just couldnt get into it they did a lot of things very well i just dont see how they are going to cram book one into 10 episodes and have it be anyting close to satisfying for me one good thing about being an individual actor on this show you really dont have a lot of lines to remember edited by brycec 18 april 2011  0321 pm"
"wolverine",2011-04-18,"my wife has not read the books and was watching the show after i already did i was reading at the time she was sleeping before anyhow it seemed like i would have to explain a lot for her to know what was going on in the show but maybe i just like to over explain things and someone who has not read the book would be fine without any explanations"

"All-for-Joffrey",2011-04-18,"regarding the show being accessible to nonreaders of the series i watched it with two friends one who has read the books and one who hasnt the one who hasnt was interested naturally he didnt think it was the greatest program on earth like we did but he did say he would be interested in watching it weekly i think this is pretty reasonable when ever you start watching a new show particularly a costume genre you dont go into it with a complete idea of whats going on or even what the show is completely about or who all the characters are you after a few episodes you start to catch on and then if you get into it everything starts falling into place for example ive started watching the borgias and im still not clear on all the characters names besides the main few and i have no indepth background about the papacy or the italian renaissance but im still planning on watching it every week and expect to become more familiar with the characterswhats going on i think this is a pretty reasonable expectation for people who have just been introduced to got you cant expect everyone to get hooked just by a single episode the only show that i think has ever come close to doing that is the pilot of lost edited by allforjoffrey 18 april 2011  0334 pm"

"Eugene V. Debspalm",2011-04-18,"that said i am a little surprised at the high praise of the show i watched it yesterday since we got a free weekend of hbo as a directv subscriber honestly i have very little desire to watch the rest of the season you can join me at my barricade im not madly in love with it either that said i found it impossible to seperate from the books im just too immersed in them and have been talking about them too much for too long i have absoloutely no idea what the experience is for someone who dosent consider every nuance in everything from the portrayal of cat or drogo or robert to the exact average northern summer temperature part of a complicated ongoing debate in which they hold considerable emotional stake tonguegif classbbcemoticon altp  so i dont feel like its giving me anything new as such and seeing the characters brought to life is just not a need i have apparently theyre alive enough on the page for me dunnogif classbbcemoticon altdunno i do think the production by and large looks wonderful though and that much of the acting is compelling especially some characters that are a bit marginal at this point in the books like viserys or arya and i enjoyed the shirtless bathhouse scene probably more than was strictly necessitated by the demands of characterization but other things felt off or a bit hokey i look at it mostly as a vastly expensive piece of fanart at the end of the day"

"Ferrum Aeternum",2011-04-18,"overall i was very satisfied with the episode it met my expectations in almost every regard and exceeded them in others ill try not to rehash everything said in this thread and the one priorwhat i liked the stark kids exceptionally strong casting very impressive that the actors who play bran arya and jon are already scene stealers theyll need those acting chops given whats in store for their characters tyrion  jaimes bantering in the whorehouse sure the scene was over the top but it perfectly established the casual dynamic between the brothers  most of the effects particularly the wide shots of kings landing magnificent and the wall the godswood scene with ned  cat quiet effective and beautifully done viserys contrary to what some have said about him not seeming evil enough i thought he came across just fine in that regard i was glad they left in the all 40000 of them and their horses line  that fairly cements who he is and what hes about nipple twisting or no what i didnt like the direwolf discovery scene for whatever reason it seemed out of sorts with the rest of the episode amateurish lighting and some of the dialogue was hard to make out on the first pass also i found it odd that the stag and direwolf had been dead long enough for maggots to be seen crawling from their corpses inferring theyd been lying there for days did the party take an alternate route back to winterfell after the beheading  dany  drogos wedding for reasons already discussed in this thread that said i did enjoy ser jorahs brief appearance and look forward to more of his interactions with dany illyrio i generally like the actor who plays him he was great in v for vendetta but hes nothing like i imagined illyrio and he seemed kind of bored when delivering his lines also i expected illyrio to have an exotic accent rather than sounding exactly like everyone else what i was indifferent on the prologue just meh it could have been a lot better but i didnt hate it dany  drogo on the beach didnt play out like id have preferred but i suppose the necessary message was conveyedwhat blew me away mark addy holy shitthe man is robert fantastic performance and i cant wait to see more the things i do for love scene one of the most memorable scenes in modern literature yeah i said it pitch perfect to how i had envisioned it yeah they were fucking doggie style so what  that made it even more shocking to the audience powerful and effective the music obviously a matter of opinion ie some people didnt like it at all the main theme is rousing and atmospheric without being over the top the bit at the end as bran made his climb was very well done but what really got me was the bombastic piece that accompanied roberts entourage into winterfell wow that got the juices flowing  the opening titles put me firmly on the side that found the credits brilliantly executed and fascinating to watch i was mesmerizedoverall i give the episode a solid b with confidence that the best the series has to offer is still to come"
"Eponine",2011-04-18,"werent there leaked photos a long time ago showing the dead direwolfc corpse taken in an actual park i think this scene was actually shot outdoors regardless of whether or not it looked like a stageclarification i didnt mean that i think everything looked fake rather the backgrounds were very very sharp and focused  i mentioned in the previous thread that when dany viserys and illyrio are walking in the garden the bush to the left is as much in focus as the actors it makes it hard for me to forget that im watching a production instead of being completely immersed in the show i think a lot of the excitement about the show for me is the opportunity to watch and discuss it with other people ive always enjoyed dissecting the details and its like a chance to do it all over again but with everything fresh and new i was watching with the denver bwb and we talked about all the details for another hour after it was over while it played again in the background  that wouldnt have been the same at all if i hadnt read the books in advance and im sure it would have been a lot less fun sitting at home by myself with no idea what was going on"
"Alcarin",2011-04-18,"ok i watched the show twice just aired in my country and here is my short review of goods and bads hmmmm they said to always say good things first well ill go with bad for a changeits all my opinion negative  prologue excluding the first few scenes and ser waymar royce  daenerys going to bath slowly for the sake of cleavageit was yummy though but still id prefer more story  i thought dothraki were dry humping possibly wrong but i swear i saw it like that  id prefer more tension before jaime throws down bran was cool somehow still cos it felt so casual positive  the wall and ser waymar royce  intro music and map with itheared it changes in episodes adding other locations sounds great  most of introductions were done subtle and good the jaime lanninster one felt a little forced though tonguegif classbbcemoticon altp   most of the actors did good job in nailing the book character behavior from me show gets 910 i liked it and the 1 hour went past so fast i forgot to drink and eat stuff i preparedliterally but i will be forever against this prologue it is allthough fitting the show done badeven if we exclude the gbeing faithful to novel hope the ratings surpass 2 millions rumors go that it was 16 on sunday premiere but will the final numbers include us who did not get to see sunday evening premiere since for example here in europe it was 1 day later i hope they do and cannot wait for 2nd episode cheers all"
"Kalbear",2011-04-18,"one thing id like to remark on is how different it looks in hd vs not the nonhd makes it look a bit soundstagey andcheap the hd version  you notice so much more you notice the color of hair better the sigils of the shields the clothing and the attention to detail on the dirt the maggots crawling on the corpse of the stagits just a huge deal i was surprised  im a hd fanboy but i was astounded at the level of detail they had"
"Eponine",2011-04-18,"also anything that gets us all geeking out again is a huge success as far as im concerned"
"BryceC",2011-04-18,"but other things felt off or a bit hokey i look at it mostly as a vastly expensive piece of fanart at the end of the daythats kinda how i look at it right now ill watch the rest on netflix when it comes out basically just to see what they do with the settings but as i said i just feel like the show is just not that polished i also had pretty low expecations so it wasnt like i was setting myself up to be disappointed in fact its pretty much exactly what i expected it to be i have no problem separating the show and the book i honestly havent read game in a while because i wanted to reread everything quickly before dance came out turns out ive been waiting a whilei also wanted to comment on the whole noble savage discussion that was happening in the previous thread i think the guy bothered by it needs to understand its an alternate universe the dothroki being pastey and blond would make no sense considering the environment they live in that is as far as it should goid love to hear his opinion on han solo and chewy though would you consider han to be more of aristocratic plantation owner im leaning toward han being more huck finn and chewy being nword jim"
"Kalbear",2011-04-18,"one thing i really appreciated was this  the michael komarck art of ned at the godswoodhim at the godswood was the single most striking image for me last night and one of the reasons was that they as far as i can tell completely used komarcks work as the inspiration for it it was great seeing him polish the sword in this peaceful area and i felt like i got more from sean bean on who ned is right then than almost any other timeplus it looked great"
"Lannister? Barely knew 'er",2011-04-18,"because i cant stop rewatching a number of people earlier commented on how the kings party only had lannister banners when they rode in and how it seemed out of place right after arya jumps up on the cart theres a shot of the riders coming righttoleft the first two riders clearly have baratheon banners it goes by very quickly theres a cut to the middle of the group and the camera then lingers on the lannister banners before moving on to joffrey and the hound beyond that theres a few moments where the baratheon banners are flapping in the background behind ned and robert but they definitely seem under emphasized"
"Kat",2011-04-18,"clarification i didnt mean that i think everything looked fake rather the backgrounds were very very sharp and focused  i mentioned in the previous thread that when dany viserys and illyrio are walking in the garden the bush to the left is as much in focus as the actors it makes it hard for me to forget that im watching a production instead of being completely immersed in the show sorry that was actually in response to the guy who said the direwolf scene looked soundstageyto be honest i wasnt really paying attention to cinematography was watching on someone elses large hdtv whereas i dont have an hdtv and will be watching subsequent episodes in standard definition on kind of a crappy tv hopefully in the future when the dvds come out ill have something better to watch them on"
"MindLikeWarp",2011-04-18,"does anyone else think it will be harder to keep the characters as grey as the novels will the show be able to make fans root for other families besides the starks i root for the starks but i do have backups"
"Maithanet",2011-04-18,"i was surprised that hbo attempted to put as much as they did into episode 1 i felt like the prologue  winterfell  danys marriage was a bit much i was pretty worried that if you didnt already know who these characters are that it would just feel like a mess i think it would have been easier to follow if they had stayed in winterfell and only expanded out to meet dany in a later episode i suppose that it had valuable sex appeal and it is certainly a key part of the story but seeing as how dany still hasnt made it across the sea four books later i think we could potentially wait on her plotline for at least one episode i think that doing so would allow more explanation of whats going on with nedrobert a little more time introducing the main characters and expanding a few key scenes jon and tyrions talk at the feast and the things i do for love were both good scenes but lacked the punch they could have had if they were a bit longer that said the things i expected to be good were good the acting is great most of the details are correct and overall it feels like a good start to what could be a very special story"
"Former Lord of Winterfell",2011-04-18,"did anyone else not like how hd and overfocused the settings were i thought that it made the scenes look somewhat stagedregarding cersei and brans fate i think she was counting on shutting him up for awhile and hoping that if it came out later the recollections of a 7 year old boy wouldnt be trusted enough to actually hurt them that would be more believable on screen i think if the actor playing bran was 7 as he is in the books seven year olds are pretty easily scaredimpressionable obviously the allegation is so huge in its implication that anyone repeating what bran said to make it an issue would know they were making an enemy for life which would be pretty dangerous especially if the allegation was not believed and cersei and the lannisters had the backing of the thronein a way cerseis logic on this isnt bad given that one person had already died to cover up this secret barely a month before two deaths back to back relating to the hand might lead folks to ask more questions and certainly would convince the starks to start digging maybe just shrugging off what bran had seen as being inaccurate  if he ever did repeat it  was the better course"
"Alexia",2011-04-18,"overall i enjoyed it i loved all the stark children robert was hilarious and perfect viserys stepped off the page and came to life etc that being said i didnt like the others at all they didnt look anything like how i envisioned them  and why are the white walkers black and i honestly liked that whole scene much better as portrayed in the books with the duel and then waymars wight killing will as it was i was left wondering why they let will go after beheading gared in front of him and also okay nitpicky but what else am i here for i didnt understand why they beheaded gared  a headless wight does not sound very useful i also didnt care for the dothraki or dany and drogos wedding night and why were jon arryns eyes bugging out when he was laid out now for the stuff i liked which is most everything else i really liked the scene between jaime and cersei in kl and the scene with arya and sansa embroidering viserys may quickly become a favorite character on the show  there is something so maniacal and entertaining about his portrayal i loved it when the dothraki rode off and he came running forward asking what went wrong i also appreciated the scene where cersei admires sansas dress and says that she has to make her something  it really showcases how charming cersei is to sansa and why sansa trusts her to a fault i did miss the practice session between tommen and bran and the argument over live steel between robb and joffrey i would have liked to see the baratheon children interact more with the stark children ill watch it again later tonight because i know quite a few things slipped by me  overall i like the books more but i will definitely enjoy the series too"
"Axon",2011-04-18,"you can join me at my barricade im not madly in love with it either that said i found it impossible to seperate from the books im just too immersed in them and have been talking about them too much for too long i have absoloutely no idea what the experience is for someone who dosent consider every nuance in everything from the portrayal of cat or drogo or robert to the exact average northern summer temperature part of a complicated ongoing debate in which they hold considerable emotional stake tonguegif classbbcemoticon altp  so i dont feel like its giving me anything new as such and seeing the characters brought to life is just not a need i have apparently theyre alive enough on the page for me dunnogif classbbcemoticon altdunno i do think the production by and large looks wonderful though and that much of the acting is compelling especially some characters that are a bit marginal at this point in the books like viserys or arya and i enjoyed the shirtless bathhouse scene probably more than was strictly necessitated by the demands of characterization but other things felt off or a bit hokey i look at it mostly as a vastly expensive piece of fanart at the end of the daythe translation to screen often leaves some disappointed i know what you mean while i definitely enjoyed the show i never had a hunger for a television version of ice and fire id be more pleased actually if the series suddenly went poof and the next three books dropped into my lap instantly baller"
"Lannister? Barely knew 'er",2011-04-18,"and why were jon arryns eyes bugging out when he was laid outthose were painted stones placed over his eyes"
"MindLikeWarp",2011-04-18,"ned and jaimes scene at the feast was good jaime cutting off ned in his own hall helped in the foreshadowing the lannister and stark feud it wasnt in the books but i thought it fit well"
"Tywin's bastard",2011-04-18,"the first time i watched it i was a bit distracted by automatically seeing what i imagined from the book and there was some bit of comparison i wont say much for that view because i was a terrible viewer that time a viewer that isnt doing his best to be immersed has failed his part the second time i viewed the episode with a good deal of time between it really came alive on another level because then i only saw what was there no distracting mental images that no show can ever compare to perhaps i just got one of syrios lessons the acting is overall superb and i dont feel anyone is doing less than good i was a bit worried about a few voices feeling that dinklage overplayed his accent but after the first episode i cant agree with that i think those few people got hung up on how hes chosen to portray his character rather than truly being about the accent someone that i feel deserves praise but hasnt quite gotten enough is sophie turner as sansa i think she is just spot on with her character i think the scenery looked very good and it will only look better the more i get used to seeing it extremely high production values that pretty much made me forget im watching a tv series and not a high budget feature film all in all theyve really done well with the extremely tough task of putting this on the screen especially given how much story they have to fit into the first two episodes to set up for the rest the sort of negative things i can think of are mainly of the nitpick type and those sort of things arent interesting plus that they make me seem like i dont understand how hard making adaptations is so ill skip that"
"Soylent Brown",2011-04-18,"wow the title sequence is awesome overall i thought it was great every single character introduced so far seems to be very well cast and the locations are all brilliant i thought the new scene with tyrion and the hookers worked really well  it helped clearly and concisely demonstrate jaimes affection for his brother and it remained true to the spirit of tyrion obviously there were more differences to the book but i didnt come across anything too unpalatable as others have mentioned the drogodany wedding night scene is a bit grim but i cant really see any way around that without using up a few more minutes of screen time very impressed with the godswood scene and a little disappointed that we didnt get to see more of the heart tree"

"Mandurang",2011-04-18,"hey everyone ill share some thoughts too after watching the first episode last night my initial reaction is that it was pretty good  nothing especially mindblowing but a very good start to the series i think that it will pick up momentum as time goes by regarding the technical side i thought that overall the quality of the production was good i expected a little more armor on the knights  i recall the winterfell scene where the kings party arrives and thinking that jaime was a little too underarmored especially in the legs on the other hand the hounds helm looked a little too big and plastic for my taste especially as the visor kind of bounced while he rode very minor complaints however the one aspect i really thought id see more of was colorful costumes martin spends quite some time describing clothes and personal effects to cover the thematically rich landscape of westeros in equally rich garb and i felt that it was not addressed as much in the first episode of the series the winterfell feast scene especially seemed a little drab compared to the cornucopia of colors dagged sleeves and slashed vests i had pictured when i read the books but i suspect these minor issues will be straightened out as time progresses as far as the acting is concerned i thought it was overall great some actors pleasantly surprised me with the depth they were able to reach using often limited material special mention to the children portraying arya and bran who i also think are phenomenally suited for their respective parts i now come to the aspect of the series that was the most offputting for me the nudity before i am misunderstood let me say that i am aware that some people have raised the issue when discussing the books in particular of whether sexual scenes might be overdone i disagree with that sentiment i have no quibble at all with how martin handles sexuality in the books in fact i think that aspect of his writing is one of many that greatly contributes to the characterization and depth for which the series is justly famous that said i found the overt depiction of said sexuality in the tv adaptation a little unsettling i am struggling to describe my exact impression as i think that nudity if done right is also something that contributes greatly to a movie and i can think of some great movies that contained incredible erotic scenes however i did not expect the amount or speed with which it would be exhibited in this first episode perhaps the intention was to set the tone but if so the tone it set for me was somehow a little off was it  among other things  because as some have commented in reviews i chanced to read online danys nudity became a visual vehicle for her lack of power which they found a bit unfitting i cant really say but my for lack of a better word art sense tingled with the kind of unpleasant tingle highlander felt in the presence of other immortals i hope it goes away i wonder whether anyone shared those feelings edited by mandurang 18 april 2011  0553 pm"
"EvilClosetMonkey",2011-04-18,"i think it was almost necessary to show the more human elements of jaime and cersei from the beginning first because this isnt from any specific characters pov second because it might be a little weird for nonbookies to go through a whole season of cersei  jaime twirling their mustaches and laughing about child murder and beheading puppies only to find out they are real people after all it works brilliantly in the books to turn these stock villains around to at least understandable people in a show not so much methinks as to the nudity i sort of agree with mandurang in that it set off a slightly unpleasant tingle in my brain im just not sure what it was that did it for me i think it might have been the nude dany as powerless idea that made me uncomfortable which i think it was supposed to do so i guess thats a win for dd for claritys sake i want to say that it wasnt the way it was done or that they used that particular way to show her helplessness at this stage i think were supposed to be uncomfortable with how very controlled and vulnerable she is and if that is the case then the desired effect was achieved for me the only nonbook scene that didnt really work for me was tyrions introduction i guess im afraid that the whoring aspect of his character is going to be played up too much i still have faith that this part was just a hook to get us into part of tyrions character though and in the end i just let my primal male self take over in that scene and said hooray for boobies edited by evilclosetmonkey 18 april 2011  0603 pm"

"Josquius",2011-04-18,"i didnt think jamie came across too well i guess we see things from cerseis pov a bit much earlier than in the books robert having fun with the wench whilst she just looks on and endures robert is straight off to see the cryptbut then in the book i cant remember particularly seeing her bitchy side until kings landing but jamie just came across as a knob with the pushing bran in the book doesnt bran slip and jamie saves him but then at cerseis prodding changes his mind and pushes him here on the tv show he just goes things i do for love and shoves that whole bran climbing and seeing them scene actually didnt have the impact of the books just such a simple little climb to see them and then standing in a big window to watch edited by josquius 18 april 2011  0600 pm"
"Tywin's bastard",2011-04-18,"im going to have to watch it againthe pacing wasfine everything just felt a shade cartoony to meas if caricaturing some of the characters would help establishing them faster in a shorter time frame i dont know what to feel about this as this is relatively on par with other dramascersei and jaime are too sympathetic from the start cersei has twinges of bitchiness and jaime has a macho contest with ned but more time was spent establishing their relationship with each other and tyrion than making them villains which increases shock value at the big reveal but unfortunately sets their arcs back a bit i hope this is remedied in later episodes though i get the feeling like theyll only become more human with each minute of added screen timeviserys is the wrong kind of creepy for me i just dont see a sleeping dragon in that guy just a hammy actor in a bad wig fortunately hell get his soon enough and then the series will be all the betteron the other hand i feel sansa catelyn ned dany robert jon and tyrion were all well handled all things considered im indifferent on brancersei and jaime are like that all the time in the books as well its just that we never get to watch them from any pov other than their enemies i dont think they will be any less villainous than in the book when it comes to the scenes that are taken from that cersei will make ned kill lady and conspire against ned jaime has already tried to kill bran and will attack ned at kings landing i feel they are more interesting when we see them as 3dimensional characters like we have seen them in affc when it comes to straight out villains we have guys like the mountainyou have a very different view on viserys than i do lucky for me i guess"
"Kalbear",2011-04-18,"but jamie just came across as a knob with the pushing bran in the book doesnt bran slip and jamie saves him but then at cerseis prodding changes his mind and pushes himthis was answered in the prior thread but the answer is no cersei doesnt prod him jaime does push him jaime does catch him after he slips from seeing them and bran was clawing at his arm but thats about all they changedi thought they did that absolutely perfectly and honestly jaime coming off as a knob he is a knob this is a guy who at 7 dove off a cliff who routinely challenges anyone to a fight and goes looking for it who fucks his sister he is not the most calculating of people and in his pov he points out that cersei told him over and over again that he fucked up cersei tells that to tyrion as well the books in no way support the notion that jaime was pushed into pushing bran thats just apologist bullshit"
"TheMountainThatAbides",2011-04-18,"so after almost twoandahalf years of waiting i finally got to watch the first episode i probably have to watch it a few more times before fully appreciating it not saying i didnt like it but i was not blown away either here are my thoughts after the first episode im sorry if some things have already been clarified i havent had the time to read the other thread i only read this one up until now the thing is that the books are simply the most awesome books ever and even though i know its hard to turn these books into a tv show the combination with hbo had set up my expectations pretty high what i didnt realize until after the final credits and reading up on some wic and other posts here is that the show is not necessarily made to please diehards fans they need to lure in people who have never read grrm as well i probably had the wrong mind set as i didnt really enjoy certain parts of the first episode i think the first part the whole bit we already saw in the 15min preview was pretty sweet it had a pretty grim tone and the only think im still not sure about is the white walker look the title scene was nothing like i expected i liked it for the most part the only thing i couldnt figure out was why the camera was tilted at 90 degrees in pentos didnt really get that then the scene with the pups i also noticed the strangebright colors in this scene not sure yet what to think about it but the overall vibe i got was a bit less grim than i expected after watching the fifteen minute preview that goes for the whole episode it was all a bit more fantasyesque than in my imagination of course i know there are no such things as direwolves and weirwoods but i mostly mean the setting that it felt too stagey at times direwolves weirwood brans climbing scenes i think that could have been done more subtle perhaps overall i thought the pilot was not very subtle thats because the show is made for a wider audience of course who mostly dont know the whole story by heart already but i didnt realize that while watching for now i agree with a commenter before me that they might have done better to introduce daenerys in the second episode it felt it a bit rushed at times than again this first episode could very well be a real frame work episode and in the next few we might see more subtlety and longer scenes for all the comments i have there is still a lot to love most of the casting is spot on and the acting was great in my eyes iv yet to see poor actingcasting for me robert catelyn arya jaime and daenerys really stood out michelle fairley was probably my favorite i feel like i will really grow to love the show but i need to separate it more from the books cant wait for the next few episodes"
"VarysTheSpider",2011-04-18,"i dont think i have seen this mentioned if it was sorry was anyone else surprised at the way theon spoke to robb i would have thought that he would talk to jon that way but not robbi was too  theon and robb normally got on quite well however i suppose it does provide a bit of setup for whats to come if they inject a little bit more antagonism into their relationshipoverall i was very happy with what i saw they knew what to keep and what to add didnt get too bogged down in detail and managed to hurry the plot along while not neglecting the importance of the characters interaction the only scene that felt a little too hurried was when ned and robert were in the crypt if i hadnt read the books it wouldnt have been clear to me why they even went down there i assume a scene where they talk about the war and lyanna was cutwas also pleased that jaime doesnt come across anywhere near as melancholy and gloomy as he did in his character preview thank godi normally hate child actors with a passion but they all seem excellent even rickon that kid didnt even have one line but his excited slightly manic smile alone was perfect"

"Aoife",2011-04-18,"the title scene was nothing like i expected i liked it for the most part the only thing i couldnt figure out was why the camera was tilted at 90 degrees in pentos didnt really get thati imagine its to continually show where it is in relation to westeros and to drive home that its not on the same land mass itll also help explain i think why there isnt necessarily more direct contact  conflict between dany  viserys and robert  the other antitargs"

"Eponine",2011-04-18,"has anyone totally changed their mind about a character between book and tv show like they hated the character in the book but love them in the tv show or vice versa i know that there are many minor quibbles about soandso didnt look quite right and wasnt portrayed quite right or soandso was even more awesome or more awful than in the book but any total changes of heart i found that my book biases carried over to the show pretty heavily the only character where i really feel completely differently is sansa i sympathized with book sansa felt that she was a perfectly normal girly 11 year old didnt deserve all the hate that she got for being a naive child i think that the aging up killed my sympathy because i dont really feel for tv sansa at all and although im sure ill still feel sorry for her when shes being abused later i dont have any liking for her now"

"Sir Thursday",2011-04-19,"hmm i really shouldnt have done all the feverish anticipation ive been doing for the last year and a half  definitely felt a bit of a let down watching this perhaps it was that i had already seen so much of the pilot through the preview clips and such that there wasnt very much new stuff to see but this didnt feel quite as gripping as id hoped i still enjoyed it i guess but not as much as i was expecting specifically my gripes are these1 the opening sequence was too long we had what 78 minutes of beyond the wall stuff now i appreciate that with the lack of action in this episode there was a need for something like this to kick things off but this first episode needed to be as introductory as it possibly could would have preferred them to cut a couple of minutes off it if it would have given them more time to spend on fleshing out the characters a bit more that time could have been better spent giving us a chance to meet joffreythe hound for example they might have been able to squeeze in the duelling scene although im not sure whether that would still work given how theyve aged up the actors2 ncw cant do a british accent properly throughout there was an obvious to my ear anyway danish twang to it that prevented me from enjoying his scenes all that much it also felt like he misdelivered some pretty critical lines  or is it the other way round was mumbled slightly so that it didnt have the humourous effect it could have had and im pretty sure they could have done the things i do for love better there was no wist or wonder or regret or surprise or any emotion really and without that the line doesnt make any sense i always read it as jaime having a mixture of surprise and resignation as he realised just how far he was willing to go for cersei but none of that was conveyed by ncws delivery3 the hound doesnt really get shown as a proper character they had that nice little conversation between sandor and tyrion before the hunting party leaves but there was no way to link that conversation with the guy in the awesome suit of armour because we never really got a close up of him in either scene until someone else mentioned it on the net afterwards i didnt even realise who it was telling tyrion his conquests didnt count i think thats a bit of a shame  by not linking the two together and unless a nonreader was watching this with someone who had read the books i dont see how any of them would realise people will not remember him from this ep just look at the recaps  none of them talk about him and they could have been4 they didnt explain who theon was properly would have saved a lot of confusion for new viewers if theyd said something about him being a ward somewhere5 a couple of brans climbing shots looked a bit too fake for the most part i was satisfied with the cgi but brans climbing antics after spotting the kings arrival broke my suspension of disbelief6 benjens introduction felt too sudden and extraneous benjen suddenly appears out of the night and has a couple of nice scenes with jon and ned but he comes in after wed got through the introduction phase of the pilot it felt jarring to be introduced to another character this late in the episode without some kind of establishing statementshot they could have either a dropped some dialogue to the effect of your uncle benjen should be coming down from the wall for this or coolgif classbbcemoticon altb  shown him in castle black before the rangers go through the wall in the prologue scene then the character would have had his introduction and it would have fitted to have him show up when he didanyway enough of the gripes on to things i liked1 good locational continuity i was expecting more jumps between locations but i thought that the episode did a good job of spending a fair amount of contiguous time in pentos which helped introduce the location very well2 managed to introduce a lot of the characters without too much infodumping its always difficult having to introduce a lot of characters at once something compounded by the fact that the setting is somewhat alien as well but in a lot of circumstances the actors did a great job of selling their characters and relationships without too much dialogue we see cats longing to have a highborn lady of similar stature to talk to in the way that she tries to be welcoming to cersei and cerseis coldness in the way she ignores her we see aryas michievousness joffreys smugness daenarys innocence and lack of control through similar techniques and come to think of it ned doesnt really say all that much either despite being in a lot of conversations the fact that the acting performances are good enough to pull this off saves a lot of time that otherwise would have been spent tediously explaining thingsthere are a lot fewer likes than dislikes but thats because i was already spoiled on many of the potential likes already  i knew the locations were going to be individual and interesting i knew the credit sequence was going to be a bit different i knew the plot so the twist at the end didnt have any shock value hopefully subsequent episodes will be more

"Ormond",2011-04-19,"the norm is 1214 today but can vary from 917 in the most extreme cases if we add your fact that the periods have come earlier and earlier with time or probably rather with better living standards we find that complaining about sansa hasnt had her first yet at 13 is an extremely odd nitpickand the same thing has happened with male puberty beard growth on average starts at a much earlier age today than it did in past centuries in ancient rome there was a celebration when a young man first shaved and surviving records show this ceremony usually happening around age 21 which would be extremely late for a man to start shaving in modern timesthe aging of the children from the books is the best change the writers of the tv series could have made imho someone mentioned above how grrm himself regretted his decision to drop the five year gap because of how young it will make bran arya and sansa when they do some of the things he has planned for them this will make things much worse but he already had been really unrealistic with the ages he has kids doing and thinking certain things in agot and the other early books this even extends to very minor characters  in a storm of swords he has davos son starting to shave at around age 12 which would be unusually young for modern times and incredibly young for a medieval world i think grrm took the idea that living through extremely traumatic events makes kids grow up fast way too literally when he created his characters i think that children in these situations may seem more adult emotionally than we expect children to be because they arent as naive as most kids are but living through trauma doesnt make kids grow up faster intellectually actually there is a theory that girls go through menarche a bit sooner on average when living in very violent environments with our genes programming us to reproduce early if chances of death at a young age are high but the influences of poor nutrition and rampant childhood infectious disease in delaying puberty that one finds in premodern times would have been a much larger factor"
"JackintheBeanstalk",2011-04-19,"as for your theory the iron swords in the crypt will be useful as a weapons cache against the others later in the books i doubt it theres little difference between iron and steel and both are forged in a similar manner so one shouldnt be more linked to fire than the other the others are not spirits of the dead and weve already found something they are vulnerable to obsidian so i doubt the iron swords have any relevance if they were to play a big part i also suspect grrm would have brought it upactually we have evidence that steel is not effective against the white walkers duel in prologue where ww chuckles while his weapon steadily freezes serwrs steel blade until it simply shatters and in jons confrontation with the wight in lc mormonts tower where his steel blade severs the wights hand and the hand continues to attack he viciously slices the wight across the face and the wight doesnt react whatsoever he eventually wins this fight with a burning curtain i would also submit that grrm has brought this up as much as he hints about other clues in his books which is to say very very subtly in addition to the two outright confrontations where steel is proven ineffectual we have old nan in one of her stories tell bran that the others are afraid of iron and fire we have the specific description of the iron swords binding the kings in the crypt jon actually has a dream in which these kings are free and moving around which is possible if the swords are removed these clues are sort of pounding the iron nail imo he even gives it an extra little tap when robb leaves to go south and rickon finds out he is leaving he goes a little nuts hides in the crypt and brandishes one of the iron swords at the guards who come to fetch him a little bitty kid brandishing a rusty but still heavy iron sword seems farfetched but it happenededited for spelling edited by jackinthebeanstalk 19 april 2011  1004 am"

"Papa Manderly's Meat Pie",2011-04-19,"new to this community but not the books i actually came to the books after all four had already been published so i didnt have to wait until i finished the fourth one then i had to wait four yearsanyway i was at first disappointed with the show i think part of it was elevated expectations i should have learned my lesson with star wars episode i and the other part was that i had followed it so closely that i had basically already seen half the episode i had to stop myself last night because i started reading through the spoiler chapters for dragons posted on this site dont want to suffer the same disappointmentafter thinking about it though and reading through many of these posts i have changed my mind i was definitely focusing too much on what i didnt like as opposed to what i did like and some of what i didnt like at first i have changed my stance on in retrospect ive only been able to view it once since i dont have hbo so all of this analysis is based on memory and is therefore subject to much errorhere is my listthings i unexpectedly liked on first impression1 viserys his portrayal in the show in my opinion is a far more subtle and believable performance than what the books gave us seeing as how he was largely an ancillary character who is quickly gone that was not really a problem he doesnt need to be too nuanced but i like what the actor has done with him and think it adds to the show2 dany an amazing actress who shows so much with just her face i cant love this enough3 branarya great acting displayed by these kids and they seem to embody their respective characters wouldnt change a thing about them4 ncw as jaime didnt know too much about this actor but i was blown away by his performance for those complaining that he is too flippant i think you forget just how flippant and arrogant jaime was prebrienne you are retroactively giving him more credit than he is due here because of his character development i hated jaime until after asos the things i do for love was delivered exactly how i imagined it discounting sexual positioning and the lack of dialogue which is unnecessary since they established jaimecerseis involvement in arryns death earlier i know the book says with loathing but i dont think that means jaime was really that upset about it even in his flashbacks on the subject he never feels guilty for pushing bran he only regrets it because cersei nags him about it not because he feels bad i dont think jaime wouldnt have thought twice about what he did if it wasnt for cersei the way the line was delivered perfectly captures that dynamic5 cersei i wasnt expecting much from her since cersei is basically a onedimensional scheming bitch in the first book as portrayed by others they way she is portrayed on screen gives her a lot of humanity that i never noticed until we started reading her point of view much later on i think this is better for the format we are in where you cant manage the viewpoint through which you see a character it works in the books because martin writes from first person point of view with each character so you know that personal bias is introduced it doesnt work that way with a tv show where it is presented as unbiased third person perspectivethings i expected to like and delivered1 visuals locations effects etc2 ned and robert both actors embody their characters and do a good job of portraying their close relationship3 opening titlesthings i expected to like and fell flat1 tyrion i was all pumped for this and maybe i raised my expectations too much also it is early so im sure he will grow on me as he is developed i think he was just too frat boy for me though and his scene with jon cut his best line not all bastards need be dwarves would that line really have made the show go too long im hoping for more but this first episode didnt do it for me2 the prologue lots of needless changes that didnt add anything in terms of action time saving or world development i agree this could have been shortened to make more room for the rest of the episode and will getting away makes no sense whatsoever he is kneeling in the snow not 15 feet away from the others maybe they let him live but that seems implausible3 finding the direwolves not sure it could have been done better but the scene didnt mesh with me very well the dead stag on the road seemed fake and why would they go off into the woods to find out what killed it why would they care i think you could have done it in a more believable way but not sure what that way isthings i didnt like at first but now do1 dany and drogo originally i was in the hate this camp however the more i read it the more the book scene doesnt really make that much sense even with the inner dialogue i also dont think that this means their relationship cant become loving i am now convinced this is better for the tv medium and i am glad they showed they are willing to change things that just wont work for tv it is more willinglikely to be successful this way2 cat i didnt like her transformation from the book but i think it works better with the limited time they are given it is easier to have her always be opposed to ned leaving than to have her flipflop on the issue i also now like the angeldevil on the shoulder bit as it showcases the positives that the television medium can bring to the story i still think maester luwin was too forward with ned but that is a minor thingthings i still dont like1 tyrions whorehouse scene i just think that the four extra whores running in topless was gratuitous the rest of the scene i am fine with it establishes character but that last part is obviously thrown in for thrills and unnecessary if he had to give tyrion four more women why did they have to be milling around outside topless i get why they did it but that doesnt mean i have to like it2 the dothraki wedding it just seemed hokey even though it was pretty accurate to the book dont know why the meat had to look rotten nothing in the book says the dothraki cant get fresh meat to eat i understand dany getting the wind from drogo was cut for time but i felt it was important enough they could have cut something else like bits of the prologue3 robb i dont know he is nothing like i pictured him i guess he didnt do a lot but until i see more of him i just dont like him and robb was one of my favorite charactersthings im on the fence about1 jon snow i never liked the look of him from released photos and his performance so far is average at best of course it is hard to play an emotional teenager without coming across as stupid just ask hayden christenson as i recall i didnt care much for snow in the books either till he became his own man on the wall so i am still pretty hopeful for his character2 the hound i totally missed his scene with tyrion because i was distracted but the helmet was a little fake looking mainly due to the bouncing if he is as unimposing as others describe then i will be disappointed but i need to see more of him first to form a strong opinionedited for grammar edited by chrispwildcat 19 april 2011  1201 pm"
"Tywin's bastard",2011-04-19,"he liked the show said it was a little confusing at first but generally pretty clear his first snarky comment was that he didnt think there was enough incest his main question was how viserys and dany were connected back to the main plot he got that they were an exiled royal family but it wasnt perfectly clear to him that robert had usurped them recently his favorite character was viserys who he referred to as the evil blond douchebagso what he didnt find was clear then was that king aerys was killed when he was usurpedthats alright im not really trying to argue but i feel that i have defended my theory at last rather than just throwing it out there without supporting evidencethats good i enjoyed reading what you wrote and figuring out if i personally felt it was likely or not feel free to gloat if you happen to be right smilegif classbbcemoticon alt "

"JackintheBeanstalk",2011-04-19,"chrispwildcat exceptionally nice writeup i happen to agree with most of what you wrote especially wrt tyrions whorehouse scene tyrion while a serial cocksman has always come across as a man who hooks up with one woman at a time and treats her with genuine affection not a menage kind of guy oh well small quibble could very well be a device to plant one first impression of his character with the audience only to swivel it around later which is fated for a great number of these characters after all i didnt think the meat at the wedding looked rotten just well cooked i think dany was a little startled by the flies but hey its just an introduction to her new life which will be lived for the most part outdoors"

"Myrish swan",2011-04-19,"i loved it the pace the actors everything i especially liked lena heady as cersei i think she gave a quiet dignity to the part that cersei often lacks but i think should have in the books also michelle fairly was great as catelyn though i think in some of her actions they seem to be trying to make her a more sympathetic womanly figure rather than the stoical hard as nails woman she was in the books for instance her quiet protests against the beheading her desire for him not to go south etc the fact that she is both hard in pursuing her duties and what is expected of her and her family and simultaneously a loving wife and mother is what makes her such an interesting dynamic character in my mind but perhaps people will find the catelyn devoid of her hardness proactiveness and family ambition more sympathetic in the tv version anyway i loved jaime and tyrion as well although the scene with the dozen hookers was a bit heavy handed in some respects though it did show the closeness between the brothers quite well as others have said my one small problem is ned he seems a little bit more of an action man in this show than he seemed in the books that is cocky sardonic boastful awesome at fighting and athletic pursuits snarky etc of course we havent seen much of him so far and my feelings are not based on much in particular i was bothered by his line to jaime i dont like to fight in tournaments because when i fight a man for real i dont like him to know what i can do that line and sean beans delivery were just not the ned of the books to me one interesting thing about book ned in addition to his surface stoicism hiding his intense emotions is the fact that hes really not a conventional hero he was not the original heir to winterfell and as it notes hes not particularly tall and is fairly plain looking in addition hes not particularly charming he seems somewhat shy and socially awkward when lf bates him in agot he is not particularly witty most of all hes only really an average fighter and is thus not really all that boastful that line seemed to make him more witty confident and physically strong than he ever was in the books soyeah maybe im making to much of one little line but since the jaime exchange seemed like a character forming moment it just struck me the wrong way anyway overall i loved it edited by myrish swan 19 april 2011  1235 pm"

"lokisnow",2011-04-19,"did anyone else not like how hd and overfocused the settings were i thought that it made the scenes look somewhat stagedyour tv is probably set up wrong like most tvs are natively of with motion smoothing turn off that abysmal function and it will suddenly look a lot more filmlike instead of realer than realmost televisions these days have a way to disable the antijudder technology that smooths out the motion between frames and while most people wont even bother to change it people should be aware of its existence especially if the motion appears fake or unrealoverall i was stunned at how much they packed into a single episode its so strange to not have commercials and to realize that show can be longer than 4230 and still be an hour long show since i work in commercial television and every day watch down shows that are 42 minutes long it discombobulates me that an hour of television has so much contenti am incredibly impressed by the economy involved in the introductions and the efforts made to still take their time with scenes and not rush things i would almost say that the pacing is just a hair bit slow but its not really a concern because i really love that they take the time for dany to slowly enter the bath or give time for the pageantry of the royal arrival that they managed to introduce and distinguish all the lannisters the king all the starks the wall and dany and viserys in a single episode as well as progressing the plot significantly rather than just exposition we also get the wedding and brans fall i thought the episode was really nicely structured in a serial fashion i dont really feel it has a beginning middle and end as a single episode of tv per se but im not sure hbo is interested in making tv shows that have single episodes stand alone on the other hand it doesnt quite feel like 110 of a very long movie or miniseries so theyre striking a nice balance between standalone and single workthe series opens with a really spectacular sequence the silent progression into the northern wastes i love the methodical opening shot as the gate slowly rises in front of waymar royce and company the metaphor is nicely done hbo is lifting the gate for the series letting us into the world while will is a very noisy ranger with a noisy horse and crawls noisily up on the wildlings the atmosphere of unease is quite well established and there are a number of a wonderfully staged shots in this sequence and then we run into the urukhai and i get my first major disappointment of the series the otherscumurukhai are profoundly wrong in every way compared to my imagination i pictured them as more monstrosities silverbluewhiteice colored skin with a build that was bipedal but perhaps only vaguely human not proportioned like a maninmonkeysuitandrastahair sillyness that hbo chosei only harp on this point because i feel so early in the show getting the others wrong its a shame that losts use of the term forces hbo to use white walkers or wight walkers could be a turn off for some people but that is always the danger for the show in even including the prologue since it is so very different from anything else well see for the next four or five episodes and very different from the rest of the premiere episodesean bean is nothing at all like i imagined ned to look but he absolutely projects the air gravitas and authority of ned as i imagined him he so completely nails the part that i already hear his voice when i skim through a book and see some ned dialog catelyn i feel is perfectly cast she has a hardbitten tough as nails quality to her that is going to develop extremely well when she spends most of the rest of her characters life out adventuring on the continent maisie williams is perfection as arya and other than a really bad piece of adr between her and sansa i loved everything in her performance but doing voice over adr is particularly tough for untrained actors bran looks good sansa looks good i really like the look of robb jon is the only one with a terrible look but that may just because i never pictured him with poofy curly extravagant hair waymar royces look more closely matches what i think jon looks like i love the visual way they introduce arya and sansa we cut from the archery to an interior tracking shot the camera moves around sansaho is happily sewing away to the praises of septa mordaneto reveal arya who looks very unhappy and bored and who perks up to the sounds of arrows and laughter outside this one shot coupled with the transition to arya showing up bran in the next sequence establishes the contrast between arya and sansa and aryas mischievous spirit the highlights of the episode for me though was everything on pentos with viserys and dany i felt these scenes were the best written and acted and directed moments of the episode and were pretty much without flaw i even liked the controversial wedding night but then ive always felt that the book wedding night was a little too romantic in contrast to the harshness that dany experiences from him after the wedding night i think the way they handled the khals no lines got much of the scene without compromising future development of her character its not rape by westerosi understandings and its not consensual by our understanding i feel the way it was portrayed got more at the tragedy of the moment that this is what wedding nights were like for women or royalty and underscores the limitations and strictures most women lived under in premodern times were getting our first taste of how the series will rip the princess myth to shreds if anything the book romanticized things a little too much but it has the opportunity to do that by letting us in to danys intimate thought processes leading up to the marriage consummation a luxury the filmed medium doesnt allow fori liked the look of all the sets and costumes and locations it very much matched the lion in winter look i had given everything in winterfell and castle black in my mind the production design is incredibly well done i loved the little background touches like the mantle of dripping candles the one exception is that the heart tree looked built with fake sewn on leaves thats the only place the execution seems slightly off to me that and i imagined winterfell to be bigger at least the outerwall much bigger in order to encompass a small godswood rather than a godsgrove but none of these things really matter to me i point them out as individual difference in how i pictured things but its just a different perspective i dont see it as getting it wrongi had always imagined the things i do for love to be said regretfully to bran having it said to cersei makes sense and certainly lends a different tone to the scene and i really like the different approach not what id imagined but excellent nonetheless overall i absolutely loved it and aside from the others i dont feel like they got a single thing that matters wrong its pretty much as perfect as i could have hoped for edited by lockesnow 19 april 2011  0123 pm"
"atm_grifter",2011-04-19,"hello all first post to the forums to preface things let me say ive been an advocate of the series since 1998 and am proud to say ive turned close to 30 people on to the series each one of course becoming an addicted fan this series coming to hbo has been a hope ive had for some time so far im quite pleased however i think an interesting thing to discuss are the changes weve noticed either in plot or character that could have some significant effects on either plot or memorable scenes i count two that stand out to mefirst tyrion being introduced as a whoremonger while i dont think this is something that the writers cant handle in terms of steering the characters back towards their representation in the book it still seems a challenge this is in particular regard to shae in his first meeting with her it is quite clear that tyrion is somewhat honorable and later once in kings landing that he holds his monogamous relationship to be important to maintain put simply he loves her in the book this was easy to believe because tyrion was never set up to be so lecherous but now the writers present themselves with a problem to solve so the viewer isnt taken aback should the writers follow what was laid out in the booksecondly the lack of significant scarring on the hounds face ive already had a couple of conversations with people who didnt realize that the hound was actually the one speaking with tyrion at one point making the remark about paying for women its quite clear that it is since a its the same actor who raised the face guard of the hound helm which even then you could tell he wasnt scarred nearly enough and coolgif classbbcemoticon altb  his scalp was at least scarred missing hair this is hugely problematic for the encounters between him and sansa and potentially others my guess currently is that those scenes will simply be excised which actually may be fineanybody agree or disagree or think of any other issues that should be interesting to see how they get resolved due to their noticeable difference edited by atmgrifter 19 april 2011  0131 pm"
"Isabella Stark",2011-04-19,"they couldve done some simple things like colored contacts to make viserys  danys eyes the right color same with tyrion with his one black eye  one green eye and his blond hair thats almost white in curls down to his collar and i swear if i here white walkers one more time im going to scream they are the others 99 of the time grrrthey tried purple contact lenses for viserys and dany apparently they were extremely uncomfortable for the actors so they dropped italso ive read that due to lost also having a group of people known as the others the producers decided to go with white walkers"
"Isabella Stark",2011-04-19,"also regarding tyrions hair color speaking as someone whos tried to go platinum blond its really hard to go that blond and not look like crap you need just the right skin tone and peter dinklage tyrion does not have it going any blonder with him would have looked terrible"

"arrowfan",2011-04-19,"i loved the premiere seen it 3 times and have enjoyed it more with each viewing my only real concern is with opening scene prologue of the book i just cant figure out why they changed the scene from the book not only do we not have the dramatic scene of the kid hiding in the tree while the others kill the rest of his scouting party but were left with a seriously unexplained escape by the kid in the pilot the kid is on his knees within 1015 feet of the other how did he escape sure death at the hands of the others oh well and of course the others look like wildlings hmmmph"

"Daenerys",2011-04-19,"i give the first episode an 8 out of 10 really hard episode to pull off perfectly no doubt but overall very well done and you have to give them some credit just for getting it done at all i also watched the first episode of camelot out of curiosity and its a joke just seems very insubstantial and frivolous by comparison watching both of these underneath you can really sense the master storytelling powers of martin vs amateur writers who are out to create exciting television fantasy best things  michelle fairley really impressed me i was worried about her but she was fantastic i totally buy her as cat now  was also a bit worried about peter dinklage kit harrington and lena headey but i thought they all did well and will do their characters full justice  mark addy i expected to be really good as robert and he was  basically 95 of the casting is amazing they really nailed it on most of the characters even the secondary characters like luwin rodrik benjen etc were prefect cant wait to see arya get more screen time and littlefinger  did love dany getting into the bath scene they added the waters too hot my lady nice  kingsguard armor didnt bother me as much as it does some others apparently hounds helm is pure awesome worst things  this episode was too short a lot of things seemed rushed should have been 90 minutes ending at the same place but filling in some of the scenes more for example why dont we get to see dany riding her silver horse the wedding gift from khal drogo this is an important scene its the first time drogo smiles when he sees a spirited dany riding the horse or the sparring scene between bran and tommen opportunity to meet joffrey the hound there and let robb say something  the music totally forgettable for me even after a second viewing sorry just very unimaginitive i did like the subtle creepy theme they used north of the wall but thats about all that really stood out for me the music isnt so bad it ruins anything for me but it didnt help elevate it either i have to wonder which composer worked on which parts as they were changed out at one point  all the dothraki stuff pretty much sucked the scale of it feels too small the costuming and sets are all over the place its really kind of a mess the wedding scene was just weird and phoneylooking to me and who the hell gives a crate of snakes to someone as a wedding gift anyway um thanks but a lot of the dothraki story never my favorite parts of the book anyway even though daenerys is obviously going to be a super important character at some point theres interesting parts but whenever i was reading that story all i could think of was when do we get back to kings landing meh  the incongruous credit sequence i know everyone loves this taken out of context i love it too it looks amazing but it doesnt fit the look and feel of the show at all again not something thats going to ruin anything for me but i feel like they went too far with it try to look at the 3d map underneath all the shiny gears and rising buildings the map itself is gorgeous it didnt need all the mechanical doodads which distract from showing the geography of the world also how could they screw up all the house sigils next to the actors names a lot of people wont notice or care but wow thats a pretty big oversight when you know house sigils are an extremely important component of the show i cant believe no one checked on or caught these errors sansas a targaryen really  emilia clark as daenerys still worried about her but im willing to give her some time she spent the entire episode with that faraway doeeyed stare perhaps appropriate but her performance seemed a little onenote to me  robb seems completely personalityfree hopefully he has one somewhere rickon is completely invisible although to be fair hes basically invisible in the books too  the prologue seemed a bit off to me would have preferred it to be a bit more mysterious and less graphic the ritualistic arrangement of body parts and the message sent by the ww was odd and theres still the question of how the hell gared gets back over or through the wall and with no horse at that without anyone noticing him the little girl was suitably creepy though edited by daenerys 19 april 2011  0204 pm"

"Xenophon",2011-04-19,"i am incredibly impressed by the economy involved in the introductions and the efforts made to still take their time with scenes and not rush things i would almost say that the pacing is just a hair bit slow but its not really a concern because i really love that they take the time for dany to slowly enter the bath or give time for the pageantry of the royal arrival that they managed to introduce and distinguish all the lannisters the king all the starks the wall and dany and viserys in a single episode as well as progressing the plot significantly rather than just exposition we also get the wedding and brans fall i thought the episode was really nicely structured in a serial fashion i dont really feel it has a beginning middle and end as a single episode of tv per se but im not sure hbo is interested in making tv shows that have single episodes stand alone on the other hand it doesnt quite feel like 110 of a very long movie or miniseries so theyre striking a nice balance between standalone and single workthe series opens with a really spectacular sequence the silent progression into the northern wastes i love the methodical opening shot as the gate slowly rises in front of waymar royce and company the metaphor is nicely done hbo is lifting the gate for the series letting us into the worldi love the visual way they introduce arya and sansa we cut from the archery to an interior tracking shot the camera moves around sansaho is happily sewing away to the praises of septa mordaneto reveal arya who looks very unhappy and bored and who perks up to the sounds of arrows and laughter outside this one shot coupled with the transition to arya showing up bran in the next sequence establishes the contrast between arya and sansa and aryas mischievous spirit the highlights of the episode for me though was everything on pentos with viserys and dany i felt these scenes were the best written and acted and directed moments of the episode and were pretty much without flaw i liked the look of all the sets and costumes and locations it very much matched the lion in winter look i had given everything in winterfell and castle black in my mind the production design is incredibly well done i loved the little background touches like the mantle of dripping candles the one exception is that the heart tree looked built with fake sewn on leaves really interesting to hear a tvprofessionals take on the show its easy for me at least to sometimes overlook the artistry in setting up shots etc also i hadnt really considered how much the episode stands on its own vs feels like a part of a longer movie that will be something to watch for going forward"

"Jon M",2011-04-20,"yes fuck shows up all the time in the books youre selfcensoringif youre really having a hard time with them changing completely unimportant details chances are there will never be a show that will work for you as far as this goes if it bothers you that dany doesnt have purple eyes or that they dont show a 13 year old getting naked and being raped on television youre likely not going to be happyi havenâ<U+0092>t read the books in a couple of years i just started agot again it certainly doesnâ<U+0092>t appear as often as itâ<U+0092>s used in the show and i didnâ<U+0092>t say iâ<U+0092>m having a hard time with them changing those details just that they couldâ<U+0092>ve done it better as for the last comment i wonâ<U+0092>t even dignify that with a response my problem with the postwedding scene which i just finished reading yesterday is that dany was not raped in the book the scene ends with her saying â<U+0093>yesâ<U+0094> and guiding his hand down and finger in them not taking that scene out all the way in the show ultimately takes away from drogoâ<U+0092>s character this thread includes book spoilers and i was the one who brought up the topic of iron swords vs spears in the show because i feel that the iron swords in the book are important so tangential maybe but not irrelevant in my opinionthat was the fact that started the little discussion we were having jackinthebeanstalk felt that there might have been a significance of the swords in relation to the others and that this change would in that case not work with thatedit apparently i cant read and missed that jack had already responded to thisgotcha like i said i didnâ<U+0092>t have the time or energy to read the previous 10 pages or the previous thread if you look closely youll see that its great swords not spears they are held upright like spears not over the knees as in the book but they are still swordsi will have to look at that again thanks for catching that  letting us knowseriously the word is used on numerous occasions by multiple characters the 40000 men and their horses line defines viserys as well as any other line of dialogue he says you dont remember that from the booki had forgotten about that scene until i read it yesterday they tried purple contact lenses for viserys and dany apparently they were extremely uncomfortable for the actors so they dropped italso ive read that due to lost also having a group of people known as the others the producers decided to go with white walkersi forget how uncomfortable contacts are if you donâ<U+0092>t normally wear them that makes sensei thought about that regarding â<U+0093>lostâ<U+0094> but i think if they had just identified them in the opening it wouldâ<U+0092>ve been ok itâ<U+0092>s not like the makers of â<U+0093>lostâ<U+0094> couldâ<U+0092>ve copyrighted it i<U+008A>also regarding tyrions hair color speaking as someone whos tried to go platinum blond its really hard to go that blond and not look like crap you need just the right skin tone and peter dinklage tyrion does not have it going any blonder with him would have looked terriblethat makes sense too i can see that there are certain things like that which canâ<U+0092>t be done for good reasons and these are small details but they wouldâ<U+0092>ve added to the show for me at least they sort of forked illyrioâ<U+0092>s beard i<U+008A>my only real concern is with opening scene prologue of the book i just cant figure out why they changed the scene from the book not only do we not have the dramatic scene of the kid hiding in the tree while the others kill the rest of his scouting party but were left with a seriously unexplained escape by the kid in the pilot the kid is on his knees within 1015 feet of the other how did he escape sure death at the hands of the others oh welli agree i think the opening was entirely too long for as little as they did with it but then many scenes have been changed in ways that donâ<U+0092>t make sense and seem unnecessary  kingsguard armor didnt bother me as much as it does some others apparently hounds helm is pure awesome this episode was too short a lot of things seemed rushed should have been 90 minutes ending at the same place but filling in some of the scenes more  robb seems completely personalityfree hopefully he has one somewhere rickon is completely invisible although to be fair hes basically invisible in the books tooi mostly liked the kingsguard armor though it certainly wasnâ<U+0092>t white the only thing there that i noticed was that jaime wasnâ<U+0092>t wearing his white cloak there was nothing in the opening that showed he was part of the kingsguard maybe itâ<U+0092>s not relevant yet but why not just start it off righti also loved the houndâ<U+0092>s helmi agree that it was too short a lot of premieres are longer and they couldâ<U+0092>ve done a lot with the extra time they left out a lot of stuff that will be missed and included stuff that was either irrelevant or unnecessary i think the kid playing rickon is just right i agree with you on robb though i think they got the look right unlike jon but heâ<U+0092>s got no personality and the actor like many doesnâ<U+0092>t seem comfortable with his character regarding fuck it shows up five times in agot viserys threatening to let the khalasar have their way with dany arya talking to city guards outside the red keep i want to fuck the queen myself for all the good it does me littlefinger goading ned by asking if he fucks with the kings  tyrion raging against mort the jailor in the eyrie and a dying robert exasperated with ned ah fuck you ned i killed the bastard didnt ithank you iâ<U+0092>ve only run into the first one so far in my reread of agot i guess the main thing i was getting at is that itâ<U+0092>s not used nearly as much in the books as it was in the first episode which you just verified i know itâ<U+0092>s hbo but that doesnâ<U+0092>t mean you have to include it in every other line especially when it adds nothing to the show in the book i think it comes as less of a surprise because bran is listening to jaime and cersei talk without seeing them at first and from the conversation you can figure out who it is and put two and two together  there are two pages of conversation and a few incriminating noises before bran actually sees them which has a different effect than the omg sex of the show although the scene isnt extremely sensual in the book it shows a lot more about the kind of relationship that they have  obviously something that would have taken too long on tv but nonetheless one that has a much different and more personal tonea lot of what was said during this scene in the book they moved to the scene where jaime and cersei were looking down on jon arrynâ<U+0092>s body i donâ<U+0092>t understand why they even included that scene since it was unnecessary and didnâ<U+0092>t appear in the book and hodor is fat i imagined him thin but i dont remember the book descriptioni havenâ<U+0092>t gotten to the description of hodor in the book but i also thought was more â<U+0093>lean  meanâ<U+0094> in the book and younger as well im pretty sure youd miss the face in the godswood tree in standard definition even in hd its subtlei was watching in hd and the only reason i saw the face is because i looked for it even looking for it it took me a minute to find it didnt someone straight out mention the hartdirewolf omen in the booki agree it would have made more sense if she said it before dany stepped into the poolno one mentioned that omen in the book as far as i recall i just passed that scene in the book and it hasnâ<U+0092>t been mentioned yeti donâ<U+0092>t know whatâ<U+0092>s up with how this forum software works but itâ<U+0092>s driving me a little nuts when iâ<U+0092>m typing it keeps jumping to the top and â<U+0093>multiquoteâ<U+0094> only works one page at a time annoying"
"AquariumDrinker",2011-04-20,"didnt someone straight out mention the hartdirewolf omen in the bookno it is not voiced but it is mentioned that people took it to mean something by how they reacted to the bit of antler i didnt catch the significance of it until i did a reread"
"Myrish swan",2011-04-20,"okay ive got a minor and sort of silly question regarding theon during the shaving scene with the three boys jon asks rob and theon why they have to get all fixed up shaven for the king theon then makes a sly comment that he suspects its for the queen and then he says something about the queen but i really couldnt make it out did anyone else manage to catch his line there i know its ridiculous to be dwelling on small things like this but its just that theon got so few lines im kind of dwelling on every one also im really curious to see what theon would say about cersei"

"Ferrum Aeternum",2011-04-20,"i had forgotten about that scene until i read it yesterdaythats cool ive reread the series 3 times and there are well known lines i dont always remember verbatim either that one just stuck out to me for whatever reasoni mostly liked the kingsguard armor though it certainly wasnâ<U+0092>t whiteim glad kinsguard armor isnt quite white  enameled solid white armor would draw derisive comparisons to imperial stormtroopers from star wars sometimes things read better than they look in real life on a got thread at another forum i frequent unrelated to asoiaf a guy was complaining about jaimes armor not being golden enough shiny golden armor is fun to read about but would probably look silly or cheap on a tv screeni think the kid playing rickon is just right i agree with you on robb though i think they got the look right unlike jon but heâ<U+0092>s got no personality and the actor like many doesnâ<U+0092>t seem comfortable with his characterthis is very common in pilotpremiere episodes in any genre the actors dont really know exactly how to play their characters yet especially if they dont have many lines i expect everyones performances to improve as the show progresses thats one reason i havent gotten my drawers in a twist over too many minor foibles thus far its just one episode and there are at least 19 more to go hopefully many more than thatas to richard madden as robb his performance didnt do much for me either with the notable exception of the look he gave joffrey making eyes at sansa in winterfells courtyard as the royal party rode in quite amusing and befitting a protective older brother a lot of what was said during this scene in the book they moved to the scene where jaime and cersei were looking down on jon arrynâ<U+0092>s body i donâ<U+0092>t understand why they even included that scene since it was unnecessary and didnâ<U+0092>t appear in the bookit was important for a number of reasons to non readers firmly established the lannister family particularly cersei  jaime as important players in the series remember neither has a pov chapter in the first book drove home the death of jon arryn as an important event and more than a passing mention from cat to ned in the next scene explained what the hand of the king is and began to sketch the outline of the power structure in kings landing hinted that something sinister was afoot and that jon arryn had knowledge of itall these are essential points to establish with the audience i thought the scene was executed brilliantly as it was 100 exposition but didnt immmediately appear that way like it or not tv series need expository scenes like this for the benefit of those not familiar with the source material or dont remember every detail winkgif classbbcemoticon alt i havenâ<U+0092>t gotten to the description of hodor in the book but i also thought was more â<U+0093>lean  meanâ<U+0094> in the book and younger as wellyounger yes but i envisioned him being a very large burly man obviously strong buildwise i think kristian nairn is perfect his age 34 is also fine considering all the agingup that was done with other characters"

"Rinso",2011-04-20,"i see that there are many discussions around here i also see that ill beat a dead horse with some of my points but i feel like i want to share my opinion even though nobody but me cares and that it probably wont be new or fresh so the easiest way is to do a simple list of the things i liked and the things i disliked and then give my brief opinion things i liked the acting not a single performance i dislike so far although we didnâ<U+0092>t saw much from everyone involved and there are characters that are yet to appear iâ<U+0092>d classify mark addyâ<U+0092>s robert and nikolaj costerwaldauâ<U+0092>s jaime as the ones that made the biggest impression on me mark addy is robert the guys and gals who doubted him at first clearly have judged wrong from his drunkenly flustered face through his rough rowdy laugh to his energetic bodylanguage that doesnâ<U+0092>t quite fit his body and shows that he once was a drasticly different person he embodies what robert is as for nikolaj costerwaldau the â<U+0093>things i do for loveâ<U+0094> scene completely sold me and i canâ<U+0092>t wait to see more of him in the next episodes and seasons the way he looked at bran and said â<U+0093>tenâ<U+0094> was brilliant so much was conveyed into this simple one line the look in his eyes and his voice said â<U+0093>my whole life i was labeled the kingslayer a liar and an oathbreaker with shit for honor and now iâ<U+0092>m gonna kill a 10year old kid because he saw me fuck my sister whatâ<U+0092>s nextâ<U+0094> the guy nailed jaime for me and i heartily forgive his unmatchingmyimagination look tyrion and cersei were also cool but iâ<U+0092>ll reserve my gushing for the second episode when we should see more of them ned was ned â<U+0096> coldblooded stoic a bit angsty canâ<U+0092>t ask for more michele fairleyâ<U+0092>s catelyn acted and behaved exactly like she should even though there were considerable changes about her attitude towards nedâ<U+0092>s future handship and iâ<U+0092>m interested to see more of her the kids were all cool but thereâ<U+0092>s more to see one episode wasnâ<U+0092>t enough to make any judgement whatsoever we got good look at jon bran and sansa but robb and arya needed more spotlight next episode will amend that  iâ<U+0092>m in love with the intro the basreliefs surrounding the stylistic sun and depicting the various events of the setting â<U+0091>s history were gorgeous especially loved the wolf the lion and the stag killing the dragon â<U+0096> thereâ<U+0092>s the war of the usurper explained symbolically in less than 10 seconds and considering that david  dan have had spoilery conversations with grrm itâ<U+0092>s save to say we finally saw what the doom of valyria is methinks readgif classbbcemoticon altread   the show is faithful as hell yes it doesnt look like i imagine it when i read about it in the books yes there are new scenes and some of the canonic ones are slightly changed in one aspect or the other but the spirit of asoiaf is here david  dan are truly fans of the books its not just a stunt and it shows things i didnâ<U+0092>t like the â<U+0093>wedding nightâ<U+0094> of dany and drogo why did they change it when i read the books for the first time the way that drogo treated dany with equal parts seduction and reassurance made huge impression to me and it showed me that he wasnâ<U+0092>t the monster she initially precieved him to be in the books he took his time and was very tender and considerate here he just undressed her and bent her over and that was it he basically raped her here i think that his gentlemanly behavior in their wedding night was an important factor about how their relationship began and i was sad to see this changed  iâ<U+0092>m still â<U+0093>sosoâ<U+0094> on the prologue and its brownishblackish walkers i watched the episode with my father heâ<U+0092>s read the books and he couldnâ<U+0092>t recognize them as the others nuff said  also the dothraki just donâ<U+0092>t look right not only are they not appropriately mongolianlike but they are also inconsistent â<U+0096> some of them are clearly caucasian with lighter skin and fairer hair while others are almost completely africanoid they definitely dropped the ball with the dothraki look in my eyes though i admit their language sounds cool  almost no direwolf presence apart from summer there was scenes where there was room for nymeria and ghost at least to be shown and for the viewer to see that there is an actual bond between nedâ<U+0092>s kids and the wolf pups that can be fixed in the next episode and probably will be but still also the symbolism of the stag and the wolf that killed each other was completely unexplained and would have been good to be otherwise there is the hope that people might catch the subtext as the season progresses though i have doubts i think that so far the show isnt very friendly to nonreaders its not really their fault though they have put a decent amount of infodumps and have tried really hard to make all of this understandable to people who havent read the books but the sheer amount of characters that are introduced with their agendas and personalities is stunning ned catelyn jon sansa bran jaime tyrion cersei viserys daenerys illyrio drogo and those are only the guys with more lines and screen time there are as much secondary ones to a nongeek who hasnt read the books its probably a mess of guys with greasy hair and furry cloaksso all in all yay or nay absolutely yay yes my complaints are more but they are also more meaningless the important things  acting and faithfulness are nailed or at least nailed enough there is a tiny bit more to be desired in the faithfulness stuff i watched it and i loved it and i want more"

"Kalbear",2011-04-20,"so simply undressing her then bending her over to have your way with her is better and less cheesyits certainly faster to do shows almost as much information and if her being comfortable with drogo later on after learning how to please him and herself happens like i think its entirely redundant its easy to show that drogo wasnt totally rough with her and they did do this especially in comparison to the wedding party and its easy to show that drogo wants to make her happy he just doesnt know how this is actually kinda confusing in the books why would he switch from get her all excited to dont care moving on back to hey this foreplay thing is kinda awesome i get the foreplay the first night and then not worrying about it but if he doesnt care after the first time why would he change"

"Ferrum Aeternum",2011-04-21,"about the white walkers when tyrion is talking to lc mormont on the wall mormont tells him that the fisherfolk near eastwatch have glimpsed white walkers on the shore it seems kind of odd that this information wouldnt have been a bigger deal on the wall that he wouldnt have conveyed this information to winterfell or that benjen wouldnt have mentioned it to ned even if ned might not have completely believed it he most likely wouldnt dismiss a report from mormont out of hand and mormonts dialog makes it sound like he does believe that something is out there i think this is the first time the term is used in the book and i dont remember where else it is  is it definitely meant to refer to the others although even if it isnt wights should have been a pretty big deal tooyes  old nan and osha i believe both use white walkers as a euphamism for the others"
"Quoth",2011-04-21,"this has likely been discussed already but ive not the strength to wade through two lengthy threads a box of snakes for a wedding gift and where was samuel l jackson btw did someone comment it was from dorne my thoughts ran in this order 1 wtf 2 needed to show yet again what an alien culture danys getting involved with 3 is dorne particularly known for snakes hmmm poison red viper seriously confused now 4 is is some sort of grrm added tv layer of foreshadowing as an easter egg for the fandom beware of dornishmen bearing gifts i was really puzzled by that shot also i love how the books make me love then hate then love most characters prime example of emotional backing by me in the books is jaime hated him had grudging respect then began rooting for him but in the tv series either the actor portraying him is so damn freakin excellent or the characters been adapted for the show in a really strange way its just that i wonder how in the world ill ever come to approach liking him lolgif classbbcemoticon altlol "

"Cold Hands-Hot Pie",2011-04-21,"replying to thoughts coming in my head as im reading replies about viserys i thought the actor was perfect one person commented that they didnt think he was realistic that it didnt seem like waking the dragon was much of a threat my response is thats the point viserys is not a dragon everyone knows it but dany and him too he might be the last male targaryen but that doesnt make him a dragon he can terrorize dany and some slave girls who have been told to serve him but for everyone else hes just a powerless pawn they might try to use his claim to the throne but have little use for him jorah and dany will have that conversation later i think there were a couple of points that captured it perfectlywhen dany was introduced to drogo and then drogo just rode away viserys came running up and said wheres he going is such a perfect pathetic way about tyrion and the whores i thought the scene was a little ham handed personally like many but on 2nd thought it might be just right remember most of our looks at tyrion and whores is thru his eyes in the books in the movie we get a neutral view from the cameras perspective and to everyone but tyrion this is what his lifestyle looks like his father goes so far as to threaten to kill whores he with in an effort to control him that kind of response is not what youd see if tyrion was anything approaching discrete 4 whore tyrion is probably an accurate portrayal of the character about sansa as someone else mentioned she hit her notes perfectly at the banquet when cersei calls her up they are chatting and then cersei brings up menstration sansas face falls she fidgets and glances at cat perfect sansa is about songs and fairy tales menstration is messynot what she likes to spend time thinking about she is obviously uncomfortable she wants to marry a prince but obviously hasnt had the first thought about what else that will involve like the actual production of an heir cersei is also perfect in this scene she is obviously testing sansa and you can just see the calculations in her mind about what kind of girl this is and then she changes the subject to one where she knew sansa would be comfortable and ends the interview"

"Abaddon",2011-04-17,"after all of the build up dont really have a lot to say very satisfying to see the full episode on my hdtv after all this time a few missed notes for me here and there but overall they did an amazing job of cramming a lot of story and setup into a very short span of time with minor alterations i will probably have more thoughts on it after i get a chance to watch it again not tonight too tired i thought i would be dying for ep 2 right after ep 1 but i dont feel that way although i am not disappointed looking forward to next week the dany rape scene i would call it unambiguous in the show was really painful  as it should be"

"ohmahgaw",2011-04-17,"i thought it was decent but i wasnt impressed with the dialogue i know they were trying to fit a lot of background info through dialogue and couldnt really avoid it but i just cant stand how awkward explanation through dialogue can be when setting up a story the scene where cat is explaining why she doesnt want ned to go south comes to mind as well as when shes scolding bran abut climbing i thought the weakest people in the episode so far acting wise would have to be cat and sansa the part where sansa is begging to go to kings landing was a little painful actually i thought jaimecercei was spot on as was viserys and john although jaimes accent through me off a little bit i was underwhelmed overall by ned and tyrions character portrayal i wasnt blown away by the things we do for love part i thought the delivery was a little off also does anyone think that people who have never read the books might have a hard time telling the difference between the actors who play rob and snow my dad was pretty confused because he thinks they look too similar i think the show is decent overall and i was certainly entertained but i can definitely see why those who are not already fans might be a little bored by the first episode"

"Daenerys Stormborn",2011-04-17,"i think for trying to condense a book this size into 10 episodes its going pretty well so far understandably a lot has to be cut or introduced in other ways i think my only real quip with this episode was with the consummation scene between dany and drogo the audience didnt get to be shown his kindness and gentle approach with dany the way it ended still appeared forced and uncaring everyone else seemed to personify their characters so far very pleased and some really good lines not in the bookbut i am slightly worried after watching the upcoming previews what was with those clips of cat discovering cerseis hair in the tower and then saying she thinks the lannisters are behind brans fall unless they show the dagger scene and all that i cant imagine theyd forgo the seed is strong and have cat play a major role in that storyline"

"Rockroi",2011-04-17,"i am probably in the minority here but this is what i really liked1 the pace i really really enjoyed the breakneck speed of the show the books are dense i mean that in the most positive sense of the word and they cover a lot in just a few pages the books threw a lot at us in a really fast pace we just didnt realize it because we read at our own paces the show moves at its own pace so it seems faster this was one episode and it grabbed us by the end of the first episode probably in the same place where the books grabbed us with a valiant knight throwing a child off a roof 2 viserys i want to point out that every actor nailed their character or played the character with enough skill to draw that character into a new place however no character actually improved in scope than viserys in the books in the first few chapters viserys is in effect a weasley nutzoid crazy stupid impetuous sniveling and arrogant the shows viserys  instead of keeping those character traits disparate and apart pulling each one out as needed drew every one of those character traits inward into a single point viserys targaryen is a maniac he is crazy he acts crazy he draws all around him inward into his maniacal thoughts he is hurtful and dangerous and decidedly unrealistic arrogant and sniveling etc etc etc but in every scene the actor polishes is all together and hones it into the maniac viserys iii 3 the ambition no story line was cut down or shortened in order to make room for the other the books nailed every important point as needed with only slight alterations the fact that the book could fit all that in in such a small space is a worthy accomplishment 4 smiling ned am i the only one who liked that ned stark actually smiled in the show what i am on the fence on1 no the scene where dany is bedded by drago in the books is very slow and very very very touching drogo sheds the horselordsavageskin and instead shows a softer side he is actually tender to dany and shows that he is capable of loving her in the show the actress is clearly terrified of drogo and is fucked while terrified this worked in one sense shes a scared child who is a thing not a person to all involved and she is truly alone but failed in another that her and drogo actually had a relationship 2 the things i do for love the most important scene in the show almost failed for me for starters in the book jaime saves bran before he tries to kill him showing jaimes duality but moreso jaime treats this cavalierly even for jaime lannister in retrospect jaime always stated that he knew what was at stake when he pushed bran from the window in the show jaime treats it as nothing more than a nuisance now jaime is that arrogant but in the books i always got the sense that jaime knew how horrible this was and knew what was going to happen and did it anyway in the show  he didnt even look at bran 3 sansa age 15 sansa stark in the books is 11 on the show shes 13 the actress playing sansa is clearly 15 the actress playing sansa looks much much older than the 11 year ofl i have in my minds eye and given sansas dialog her position in the books and her reputation wrongly achieved imho on these boards makes what she is saying sound far far far more petulant and childish than if they came from an 11 year old in which case they would appear ageappropriate this can go either way but so far she sounds as bad on the show as others have said in the books what i did not like1 and only and which one of you was a marksman at age ten other than my daughter who is age nine seriously i know they have to make arya into a tomgirl who can kill etc but  no really she does not train and if she does its in secret etc but she can nail a bullseye first try its called hamhanded and it showed"

"georgeforeman",2011-04-17,"i am probably in the minority here but this is what i really liked1 the pace i really really enjoyed the breakneck speed of the show the books are dense i mean that in the most positive sense of the word and they cover a lot in just a few pages the books threw a lot at us in a really fast pace we just didnt realize it because we read at our own paces the show moves at its own pace so it seems faster this was one episode and it grabbed us by the end of the first episode probably in the same place where the books grabbed us with a valiant knight throwing a child off a roof 2 viserys i want to point out that every actor nailed their character or played the character with enough skill to draw that character into a new place however no character actually improved in scope than viserys in the books in the first few chapters viserys is in effect a weasley nutzoid crazy stupid impetuous sniveling and arrogant the shows viserys  instead of keeping those character traits disparate and apart pulling each one out as needed drew every one of those character traits inward into a single point viserys targaryen is a maniac he is crazy he acts crazy he draws all around him inward into his maniacal thoughts he is hurtful and dangerous and decidedly unrealistic arrogant and sniveling etc etc etc but in every scene the actor polishes is all together and hones it into the maniac viserys iii 3 the ambition no story line was cut down or shortened in order to make room for the other the books nailed every important point as needed with only slight alterations the fact that the book could fit all that in in such a small space is a worthy accomplishment 4 smiling ned am i the only one who liked that ned stark actually smiled in the show what i am on the fence on1 no the scene where dany is bedded by drago in the books is very slow and very very very touching drogo sheds the horselordsavageskin and instead shows a softer side he is actually tender to dany and shows that he is capable of loving her in the show the actress is clearly terrified of drogo and is fucked while terrified this worked in one sense shes a scared child who is a thing not a person to all involved and she is truly alone but failed in another that her and drogo actually had a relationship 2 the things i do for love the most important scene in the show almost failed for me for starters in the book jaime saves bran before he tries to kill him showing jaimes duality but moreso jaime treats this cavalierly even for jaime lannister in retrospect jaime always stated that he knew what was at stake when he pushed bran from the window in the show jaime treats it as nothing more than a nuisance now jaime is that arrogant but in the books i always got the sense that jaime knew how horrible this was and knew what was going to happen and did it anyway in the show  he didnt even look at bran 3 sansa age 15 sansa stark in the books is 11 on the show shes 13 the actress playing sansa is clearly 15 the actress playing sansa looks much much older than the 11 year ofl i have in my minds eye and given sansas dialog her position in the books and her reputation wrongly achieved imho on these boards makes what she is saying sound far far far more petulant and childish than if they came from an 11 year old in which case they would appear ageappropriate this can go either way but so far she sounds as bad on the show as others have said in the books what i did not like1 and only and which one of you was a marksman at age ten other than my daughter who is age nine seriously i know they have to make arya into a tomgirl who can kill etc but  no really she does not train and if she does its in secret etc but she can nail a bullseye first try its called hamhanded and it showedi was going to post something but then you said it for mei cant believe there hasnt been more angst here about drogo raping dany how can she possibly have the kind of relationship she has with him in the books if he starts out by raping her for chrissake the only reason i bought in to dany buying into the dothraki stuff was because drogo was her sun and stars she loved him passionately and he loved her back i cant fathom that relationship being started by him savagely raping her him basically waiting until she gave him permission was the reason that relationship made sense without it i dont get it at alli also dont get why they changed bran falling and jamie catching him it reduced the shock when he fell it seemed unnecessary and all things equal leave it the same if it doesnt make things better regarding whether sansa was hot enough well she looked attractive in some shots and not in others it was weird also i had no problem with danyviseryss wigs i didnt even notice them"
"WarGalley",2011-04-17,"2 viserys i want to point out that every actor nailed their character or played the character with enough skill to draw that character into a new place however no character actually improved in scope than viserys in the books in the first few chapters viserys is in effect a weasley nutzoid crazy stupid impetuous sniveling and arrogant the shows viserys  instead of keeping those character traits disparate and apart pulling each one out as needed drew every one of those character traits inward into a single point viserys targaryen is a maniac he is crazy he acts crazy he draws all around him inward into his maniacal thoughts he is hurtful and dangerous and decidedly unrealistic arrogant and sniveling etc etc etc but in every scene the actor polishes is all together and hones it into the maniac viserys iii sort of agree here the actor did a good job with the character however im expecting the writers to move viserys toward a half batshitinsane character2 the things i do for love the most important scene in the show almost failed for me for starters in the book jaime saves bran before he tries to kill him showing jaimes duality but moreso jaime treats this cavalierly even for jaime lannister in retrospect jaime always stated that he knew what was at stake when he pushed bran from the window in the show jaime treats it as nothing more than a nuisance now jaime is that arrogant but in the books i always got the sense that jaime knew how horrible this was and knew what was going to happen and did it anyway in the show  he didnt even look at bran yeah it came off like cersei was asking him to do it which is not true saving bran sighing the things i do for love tossing him thats how ive always pictured it but its not the end of the world"

"Horus Ex Machina",2011-04-17,"she brought an outside perspective to this series and had some thoughts that i hadnt even considered especially since this is so close to my heart she was majorly offended at how the dothraki were handled they are portrayed here as a savage group of primitives who rape and kill on a whim and since this is the only view of a different ethnic group it is offensive to people looking for an equal portrayal of cultures it was hard to argue against this view point especially since the culture was changed from how it appears in the books i never got any racist undertones from the books so it was weird for me to hear that point of view but i can definitely see it now from their portrayal in the show any thoughts on thisi often thought that this might be brought up but the easiest rebuttal is that the white cultures are portrayed as being no less capable of amoral behavior the only reason that we see the better side of them is that the story focuses on them more in the early episodes but we still see savagery from the westeros once dany becomes more ingrained in the dothraki culture well see the better side of them as well especially as dany tries to become more like them as her arc progresses its only the first episode and we are initially outsiders to their culture and the only one who calls them savages is viscerys talk about the pot calling the kettle black edited by horusbergeron 17 april 2011  1100 pm"

"HawkZ",2011-04-18,"agree with you on that i am a history major from college and one the key things that i took away in terms of studying history or cultures is to place the actions in the context of that era and not try to place the morality and social norms of our present day societyim completely perplexed by the shows choice with the danydrogo consummation i understand the argument that given both westeros and dothraki norms the danydrogo scene would not be culturally framed as rapebut from a character point of view the scene we say had a consent dynamic that was very very different then the book in the book you can argue that danys entire situation was coercive and out of her control and defacto rape but the fact of the matter is he asks for consent before they actually have sex and she gives it on the show he pushes her to her knees crying im at a loss as how these scenes can be seen as remotely the same in terms of the development of dany and drogos dynamic thats not to say that the show isnt changing that dynamic in an interesting or generative way but that scene was a lot to swallow"

"Hound Reborn",2011-04-18,"this day has finally come after months and months of anticipation and it definitely did not disappoint however there were some changes and scenes left out that bummed me out a little bit starting with the opening prologue scene when waymer royce fights the whitewalkers aka the others he was supposed to duel one of them for a short while as a few whitewalkers stood and watched in the opening scene he gets decapitated almost immediately that was lame and stupid definitely the most disappointing scene for me also while were still on the opening scene hbo got it all wrong and reversed will the younger looking guy who ned kills in the show was actually strangled and killed by waymar royce the wight after he came down from hiding in a tree according to the book gared the older ranger was supposed to be the one who freaked out and deserted the nights watch and was not killed by a white walker also when gared gets his head cut off by ned theon was supposed to laugh and kick the head lol however this did not happen in the show but thats a minor detail the sex scene with jaimie and cersei was all wrong too omg was it wrong she wasnt being doggied according to the books also bran clearly heard them speaking before he saw them jaimie was supposed to hold him up with one arm then fling him out the window the show decided to have them secretly having sex in some room that looked like an abandoned area of the castle lol didnt like how they brutally destroyed that scene besides bran was supposed to hear some very secretive and vital information hes going to remember soon but the show decided to screw that up sigh thats all i feel like pointing out right now as for the overall characters and look robb does look to similar to jon in the show the books described him having auburn hair and in the show its too brown i also didnt see theon wearing his kraken insignia but thats minor catelyn and viserys are the worst looking characters ive seen and they dont act like theyre supposed to in the books viserys with his horribly ridiculously baaaad looking wig made me sick to watch his personality is all wrong as well he needs to be more insane crazy hot tempered and deranged if you never read the books and watched the first episode youd think he was a stuck up snobby noble hopefully his attitude and demeanor will evolve like by next episode to how he really is supposed to be as for cat michelle fairley is to old and not nearly as attractive as shes described in the books very disappointing jennifer ehle would have been the better choice dont quite know why she left the series and last but certainly not least watching rory mccann as the hound literally drained the life out of my body most of you probably dont recall the scene where he is seen without the helm well lets just say you wouldnt have caught it if you didnt see the missing hair on the left side of his scalp mccaann looks to out of shape old with bad hair and uninteresting to say the least we all know the hound eventually evolves into a somewhat major character rory mccann just doesnt do it for me and that is very hard to swallow considering the hound is my favorite character hence my forum name smilegif classbbcemoticon alt  however when i first saw him with his armor and awesome dog helm i was very pleased overall i liked the pilot even though it did move a little slow and became boring after the opening scene with the whitewalkers honestly im happy hbo started off with that scene since i read all the books however they should have left that out for those who havent read the books now all those people will literally spend the rest of this season expecting more awesome scenes containing the whitewalkers and will end up being very upset to see they wont make another appearance this season lol my cousin read only the first chapter of the book and decided to watch the series first he described how boring it was and almost fell asleep trying to stay awake lol i personally didnt mind the boring parts cuz we all know half of the first book was basically the typical introduction getting to know the character process im sure other people who didnt read the books also found the last 40 minutes boring i just hope those people stick around cuz by episode 3 i guarantee you will be hooked just be patient with all the political intrigue involved early on thats all i have right now ps i love arya already she was hands down my favorite character from tonights episode smilegif classbbcemoticon alt  maisie williams was spot on perfect"

"Wulfnor",2011-04-18,"to begin with i read the book about a year or two after it came out an have not reread it since so my memory is sort of fuzzy the one part that really seemed railroaded with a huge logic hole in it was the one concerning the topic title first of all how did the night watch deserter escape the white walker that was no more then 15 feet from him second how did he get south of the wall which has held back the wildlings for 8000 years an once he got south of it if he wanted to survive and escape capture why would he be anywhere near winterfell walking out in the middle of a big grassy plain in the middle of the day if it would been me i would of stayed as far away from winterfell as possible keeping to the forest and traveling only at night but i suppose for the sake of expedience they had to do it the way they did another thing that bothered me was that there was no sign of agriculture in the lands surrounding winterfell no farmsteads or hamlets where in sight you would think they would be trying to harvest as much food as possible to prepare them for the coming of winter an i know that winterfell was supposable built on a hot springs but you would think there would be piles of firewood everywhere also in preparation for winter but besides those few things i really enjoyed it and am looking forward to upcoming episodes"

"Athelstane",2011-04-18,"loooooved it so much positive things to say but the few negative things are more emblazoned in my mind so let me get them out therei totally agree with the others who said that the barbershop scene was unnecessary the show would have been much better with some more screen time for the wolves or the boys training in the yard or something i know that a booktotv show transition is never perfect but to add a scene like that is totally unnecessaryi was really disappointed with the direwolves i guess i have a hard time suspending my sense of reality because they are so obviously dogs i know that using real wolves would be near impossible and using cgi would be crazy expensive so i guess using dogs was the lesser of the evils in that regard regardless i hope they still feature in their key scenes throughout the seriesi thought the dothraki marriage scene was butchered like someone else said compared to the rest of the episode it seems totally halfassed reminds me of some pulp fiction hackeryi was disappointed by viserys he does come off as a bit crazy but the two scenes in the book that really sell it are when he twists danys nipple and when he digs his fingers into her arm both times talking about waking the dragon i figured these would be key in showing how cold and heartless he is towards his sisteri thought the consummation scene was good though like others have said it wasnt so much rape as it was duty dany knew she had to do that in order to play her partfinally someone else mentioned how unrealistic is was for arya to nail that bullseye agreed maybe make her just hit the target unlike poor bran laughgif classbbcemoticon altlaugh "

"CryFenril",2011-04-18,"its lovely to come back after years of inactivity to see folk like trebla peeping back in too as someone who was around for the start of the littlefinger antidefamation league its good to see some oldtimers about  oh yes the show forced hubby to sign up for hbo just to watch it followed the hype and antihype about the actors and sets and such and was very apprehensive by the time the credits began i was hooked i knew theyd have to changeleave out a lot for times sake and what they changed was either very minor the fight with the others or helps translate a very internal and personalized characters thoughts into a visual interpretation cerseis examination of sansa i think a nonreading watcher will have a very hard time sorting out whos who but hopefully that will get resolved fairly quickly i actually enjoyed the hokey byplay between jaime and tyrion in the brothel because it shows their relatively close and easygoing relationship as compared to the strained relationships around them in that one scene you understand the relationship between the two of them quite well loved the credits with the sigul of each house on top of the castles cant wait to see more mappage dany is a wonder not only am i glad that she has such an expressive face she says so much without saying a word but im tickled that she is also shown as being bootylicious right now she is a terrified child surrounded by savages  we all know she wont stay that way for long but as introductions go theres only so much you can do before you confuse the vieweri think it would have come off as ridiculously false if her wedding night had been tender and thoughful  in the books we know what shes thinking but here all we can see is her terror and loneliness shes being handed off from one brute to another and has no control over anything drogo does show considerable restraint compared to normal dothraki behaviour  those of us who have read about him more will know that and those who never read the books at all wont find his overall behaviour out of character i accept the change with only minor reservations and unsullied at the wedding yesh the starks are welldone i had my reservations about bean but he captures the essence of ned even if hes not what most of us had in mind visually cat could be prettier true but here she is more of the devoted aware welladjusted mother and wife more important imho than how she looks not much development of jon yet a disappointment but i suppose well see what happens and yes i saw the puppies ears and fainted a little from teh cute love love love tyrion right now he is casual snide and an utter lecher  which gives him room to become very complex the episode had so very much to introduce so very quickly its enough to know that tyrion is a rather base creature with bad habits but a great brain cats comments about candles for now he will grow with the series i have no doubt dinklage was in inspired choice and i have faith that he will do his character justice as for jamie and cersei doggystyle  well it visually ties their actions to the animalistic dothraki mating style which makes their incest all the more shocking to the uninitiated two cultured aristocratic highlyplaced people of power getting it on like animals in an abandoned tower does it show their lifelong relationship of course not its not meant to its meant to be an oh my goodness moment which it most certainly is which brings me to my one gripe which isnt even a gripe more of an observation there are a handful of scenes that bring in the obligatory slightly prurient shock value for which hbo is notorious tyrions whorepile viseys fondling his sister complete with nipple closeup wobbling bare dothraki boobies the beefcake shaving scene all are geared to grab the audiences attention in a much more visceral and instinctive reaction we see flesh we perk up same with violence and bloodsplatter we may not like it or even want to admit it gets to us but hbo likes to shock and they didnt ease up on it here it wasnt as overblown as i feared it would be though nonbookreading hubby did comment that there were a lot of bare breasts and he found it hamhanded when i explained that grrm doesnt hold back and that the overall story does involve a great deal of sex he snorted and make some snarky comments about the sopranos i shant relay them here overall i would say that i am more than pleased i have waited well over a decade and a half for this to happen and while no one will ever get it 100 right to each and every reader i think this got as close as anything ever would or could of course i have minor gripes or things id like to have seen done differently  and i dont think theres anyone including grrm himself who wouldnt say the same but the total effect the gestalt if you will is what counts in my book and this nailed it i am more than happy to pay the extra bill every month just to see each episode it is to me a credit

"Rawket",2011-04-18,"first off i just wanted to say hats of to grrm and hbo i think they did a great job with the first episode for the most part when a book i have enjoyed is turned in to a movietv show i am generally let down by the movie or show the show is never able to live up to my imagination and the time constraints of tvfilm mean that things must be cut that impact the storyusually negatively however after watching the first episode of a game of thrones i have to say that this is the best book to tvfilm transition i have ever seen while there are small changes that i could nitpick about for the most part i think hbo has done an amazing job of staying true to the book granted this is only the first episode but nearly all of the characters are very much how i pictured them in my heada testament to both hbo and grrms ability to describe characters that being said i have read all 15 pages of this topic so far i havent seen anyone else mention that hbo left out the scene from the book where bran and tommen practice fight i feel like its a key scene that sets a lot of the events a game of thrones in motion now that bran has been pushed out the window he wont be practicing swordfighting with tommen in the book bran knocks tommen down in the practice yard while the kings men and winterfell men look on joffrey who is waiting to practice fight robb feels that bran has embarrassed tommen and more generally that the starks have embarrassed joffrey and his family ser rodrik calls robb and joffrey over to fight next but joffrey responds that it is beneath him to fight starks with play swords he says they should use real swords joffrey may be hoping that robb will be unwilling to strike a member of the royal family and therefore refuse the fight and lose face in front of the other men or joffrey who is likely well trained may genuinely think he can wound or kill robb either way ser rodrik refuses to let the two boys fight with real steal the entire scene angers and embarrasses joffrey to the point that he hires an assassin to kill bran joffrey gives the assassin one of his own daggers iirc joffrey got the dagger from robert who had won it from littlefinger in a tourney wager the assassin attempts to kill bran but is thwarted by catelyn with the help of brans wolf summer catelyn whose hand is cut very deeply by the wouldbeassassins knife recognizes that the dagger is made of valyrian steel valyrian steel is incredibly rare and valuable so catelyn realizes that if she can find out who the blade belonged to she can figure out who sent the man to kill bran catelyn tracking the origins of the blade and the events that follow make up a significant part of the first book it will be interesting to see what hbo comes up with for joffreys motivation for sending a killer after bran what do you guys think rawket"

"Jonias Snow",2011-04-18,"that being said i have read all 15 pages of this topic so far i havent seen anyone else mention that hbo left out the scene from the book where bran and tommen practice fight i feel like its a key scene that sets a lot of the events a game of thrones in motion now that bran has been pushed out the window he wont be practicing swordfighting with tommenwhat do you guys thinkrawketwhat i think and hope for is extended cut dvdbluerays of game of thrones with the above scene and many more edited back in including post production like pj did for lotr so beside 10 hr dvd sets we fans can purchase extended 12 hr bluerays here that hbo please its all i ever wanted"
"reiver",2011-04-18,"the entire scene angers and embarrasses joffrey to the point that he hires an assassin to kill bran joffrey gives the assassin one of his own daggers iirc joffrey got the dagger from robert who had won it from littlefinger in a tourney wager the assassin attempts to kill bran but is thwarted by catelyn with the help of brans wolf summer catelyn whose hand is cut very deeply by the wouldbeassassins knife recognizes that the dagger is made of valyrian steel valyrian steel is incredibly rare and valuable so catelyn realizes that if she can find out who the blade belonged to she can figure out who sent the man to kill brancatelyn tracking the origins of the blade and the events that follow make up a significant part of the first book it will be interesting to see what hbo comes up with for joffreys motivation for sending a killer after branwhat do you guys thinkrawketrobb and joffrey appear much further apart in age than is described in the book robb looks an adult and joffrey a young teen although i admit it would still play to joffreys character to challenge im not sure it would play right for robb to want to beat himi thought that the motivation was that joffrey had overheard robert say something along the lines of it would be better if the boy died and doing it for his fathers approval rather than a vendetta edited by reiver 18 april 2011  0929 am"
"Xenophon",2011-04-18,"im really confused at the reading of the dothraki as being entirely standins for a arabblackracialized other that people seem to be having the people at the feast were a pretty broad mix of skin tones including a few of asiaticcaucasian descent and jason momoa is of native hawaiian descent on his fathers side and germanirishnative american descent on his mothers if anything they sort of suffered from a universally brown glossing over of different ethnic origins but thats actually exactly how the dothraki are described in the booksi think theyre more distinctive in the books copper skin and dark almond eyes also iirc theres a chapter where dany realizes that she can now distinguish the dothraki from the people they are raiding but even if it were exactly how its described in the books id still agree with everyone who didnt like the casting of the dothraki in the tv show in westeros hbo was very careful to make sure each house had a certain look with the dothraki anything vaguely brown was good enough combine that with the imo silly dothraki costumes and you have something that looks like it could be in xena or a conan movie heres something that i just noticedon the map in hbo viewers guide kings landing is situated a little farther to the east than in the books on the shores of blackwater bay but in the opening credits kings landing is right where it is in the books just at the mouth of the blackwater rush so for the mythology in the show which one has it right the viewers guide or the opening creditsthe highres picture they released looks like its at the mouth of a river but i imagine itll ultimately be whichever makes it easier to film the battle of the blackwater"
"CryFenril",2011-04-18,"the lack of the childrens battle scene has been brought up briefly in a few posts but again it comes down to which details they must have and which ones they can afford to lose due to time constraints while it would be nice to see the development of hatred between the young generation of starks and lannisters its pretty obvious from all of the i wanna punch his face in comments that joffreys little butthead role has already been quite well established without the need for a fight besides joff didnt send the assassin after bran because he hated bran personally  he did it because well because its an awfully damn joffrey thing to do cersei as much as verifies it later on edited by cryfenril 18 april 2011  0931 am"
"DragonAge93",2011-04-18,"watched it last night its just too epic for words i was in awe throughout the whole episode and wanted to weep when it ended and i finished the first book yesterday so now im all prepared for what is to come even if i do know what is around the corner its still a surprise to me since now i can actually see it on screen cant wait for next week"
"LadyStormHeart",2011-04-18,"my husband fell asleep about halfway through the episode he woke up right at the end just before bran started climbing the tower after he fell husband so the kid is dead said with disbelief me no hes not dead h so the dog is dead m its not a dog h the wolf then m no hes not dead either h what so one of them has wings m funny you should say that i have to say i was slightly disappointed with the dothraki scenes the dancing and fighting at the wedding was so staged and i didnt really get the sense of evil off viserys not at all in the books i hated him immediately here i was so distracted by his looks that i didnt get a sense that something was off with him until he told his sister what hed let the dothraki horde do to her not even when he stripped her that scene just seemed a little odd i was waiting for his totally harsh and mean nipple twist that never came they should have had him hit her or something all in all i did enjoy it and i cannot wait to see more"
"Cyclone49",2011-04-18,"really enjoyed that for the most part a few minor issues here and there most of which dont really bother me so much now that ive had time to take it all in but overall it looks brilliant and i cant wait to see what the rest of the season has in storewhat i liked all of the starks in general are perfect i was a bit unsure on a few of them previously  robb seemed way too old ned just seemed a bit too rough and cold something wasnt quite right about cat  but im completely sold on them now robb still seems quite different to the character in the books but im growing to really like the tv shows interpretation and the guy playing him is a very good actor havent got any real issues with cat and i think she looks very attractive for a woman her age really liked benjen as well its a shame hell be gone in a couple of episodes theon looks promising too mark addy as robert again i wasnt really sure about him from what id seen in previews but hes brilliant in the role absolutely capturing the character from the books tyrion and jamie are excellent too and jamie again is one that didnt seem slightly right in the preview material but in the episode proper seemed to have just walked straight out of the book and into hbos casting office almost all of the new scenes especially anything that gave a bit more depth and insight into life at winterfell before everything went to hell and i really liked all the inconsequential little bits like the preparations for roberts arrival and i had no issues with the bit where the guys are shaved i thought that was a very good little character moment the opening the theme music felt a little generic to me but the visuals are incredible even if all the gears and the general steampunk feel does seem to clash a little with the pseudomedieval setting the music used throughout the episode is very good too glad it doesnt go overboard with it like a lot of television does these days im looking at you doctor who the way neds grim demeaner and the winter is coming saying were poked fun at a bit and the amount of humor in general with something like this theres always risk of it being taken too seriously and im glad it wasnt brans climbing and how it was woven throughout the episode and i had no problem with the things i do for love moment either i loved just how perverse what bran walked in on was as well  it wasnt just the queen fucking her twin brother but they were going at it in rough doggy style in some filthy abandoned part of the castle biggringif classbbcemoticon altd   just how true to the book it was yeah some things were changed but this has got to be the most faithful adaptation of a novel ive seen in my life both in terms of the actual events that take place and in capturing the feel and essence of the series and fictional universe and characters all the little touches like dany going into the bath that was too hot  about a hundred or so other things ive neglected to mentionwhat i wasnt sure about like many the danydrogo love scene didnt sit right with me now that ive thought about it more though its probably a necessary alteration and without danys internal monologue it would have seemed a bit confusing and inconsistent if done as written something about cerseis portrayal still doesnt sit quite right with me but im confident that will change in time sandor clegane i realize weve only seen a very brief snippet so far but something doesnt seem right and his helmet looked a bit goofy to be honest  i almost burst out laughing when he first appeared i do wonder how easy it will be for new viewers to fully understand some aspects of it for the most part theyve done a good job of providing amble exposition without it being too obvious or hamfisted but there were a couple of points where i thought it could have become a bit murky and confusing for people not familiar with the books the scene where ned and catelyn hear about lysas letter and are debating with maester luwin whether to go to kings landing something about it just gave off a weird vibe  the way it was framed with ned in the foreground and cat and luwin standing either side behind him with the music building up ever more dramatically as cat and luwin seemed to almost be directly addressing the audience as they spouted exposition while arguing about whether ned should do and it seemed slightly out of character for someone like maester luwin to be arguing so strongly for ned to investigate jon arryns death however i can see how such a scene would be useful for newer viewers and there was something unmistakable effective and dramatic about it slightly disappointed we didnt get the but not all bastards need be dwarfs ending to tyrions speech to jonwhat i actively disliked nothing really i guess the fact that illyrio seems nothing like the character from the books both in appearance and demeanor but hes such a minor character that its hard for me to get bothered by thatother observations what on earth were those things on jon arryns eyes theres something almost heartbreaking about watching how happy and carefree the starks are knowing whats in store for them especially the scene where sansa and catelyn are talking about joffrey i just wanted to yell no stay away from him stay away while you can neds execution of will seems rather more brutal than in the novel possibly because we dont get as much depth into just why night watch deserters are executed also theres something i really like about just how emotionally jarring the early scenes we are  theres all these sweet funny family moments that could have easily come out of some lighthearted family drama or sitcom then the kids are taken to watch their father chop a mans head off and then they go back to more fun lighthearted shenanigans then a midget is cavorting with four naked prostitutes and so on"
"CryFenril",2011-04-18,"by the way i cannot resist noting  the huge fireballish sauronseye used as the base of the rotating plate for the series title during the credits anyone else see that as a possible allusion to a certain lord of light and his upcoming invasion of the western continent or is it perhaps an allusion to dragonfire dracarys anyone grins and runs"

"XBL",2011-04-18,"i did not have as much of a problem with the drogodany scene i think the writers are trying to make danys transformation from scared abused child into khaleesi as dramatic as possible so they are going to make it take a while also it is quite obvious that it is viserys who wants this in the beginning and not dany so having her suddenly start to fall in love with him after just a wedding and a gift horse may not have made sense to those who didnt read the books extremely happy overall with the first episode excellent acting all around looking forward to kings landing"

"howland_reed",2011-04-18,"i absolutely loved it but my perception was jaded as a giddy fanboy who was just ecstatic to see his favorite series on the screen at least in my view the show lived up to the early hype and was true to the books for parts that mattered the most i saw the premier with a few others some who havent read the books lets just say while they liked the cliffhanger ending and was intrigued enough to watch another episode at least they got hooked they found the first 50 minutes slow and expository which was surprising to me cause i found the pace too quick however i will say that it did a pretty phenomenal job in setting the pieces especially for such a large ensemble cast my friends caught on pretty quickly with the family relationships and were really only confused by uncle benjen and robb who seemed more like a manofarms than neds son my one concern though is that the women in the group who havent read the books werent particularly fond of the show and called it a boys playground a nytimes article by a female author echoed pretty much the same thoughts and while i do realize that theres a large number of female fans of the book series i worry that the television show wont be able to attract that demographic as for peoples nitpicks i had an intuition that thered be a certain contingent on westeros complaining about danydrogos rape scene at first i was surprised that they didnt make it consensual as it was in the books as you do lose a bit of drogos compassionate side but even in the book i found danys acceptance too quick for a virginal 13year old whos about to be bedded by a foreign warlord moreover if she had consented in the pilot i feel such a sudden change in demeanor would not portray her kindly on the screen without the benefit of her inner dialogue i think her eventual love for drogo needs to be gradually nurtured over the next few episodes so i applaud the producers decision to make her wedding night more brutal to have her consent so quickly would make the sex seem rather gratuitous as if we were watching camelot or spartacus speaking of the gratuitious nudity was the one part of the pilot i couldve done without surprisingly the scenes we thought would be rather gratuitous  tyrions whoring danydrogos wedding night cerseijaime bumping like bunnies  were rather pg13 but i felt danys early nudity and the dothraki wedding festival were ridiculously tawdry and made it feel a bit like some bmovie skinimax flick it wasnt necessary and screamed of hey this is an hbo show lets show some random ta"

"Rockroi",2011-04-18,"the amount of explanation for example the initial explanation that arryn had died went by way a bit too quickly for my wife who had never heard of a hand let alone that character also the explanation of roberts connection to lyanna wasnt explained until they were in the crypt making it impossible for new viewers to understand what is happening when robert insists on paying his respects immediate after arriving at winterfell and cersei is annoyed on the other hand im not sure what else they could have done that wouldnt have been painfully boringits not that i disagree but we have to remember something about the show for people who are watching for the first time and have not read the books explanation is prized over execution yes they want to achieve both but they have to explain so much in just a few lines of dialog and its a lot so much so that the name rhaegar targaryen is never uttered so for anyone watching the show for the first time and having not read the books it all has to seem like who the hell are these people and why are they doing all this so in order to avoid people just shrugging their shoulders and turning to americas fattest top model on the jersey shore they have to explain these thingsthe scene that probably has the most controversy here is the danydrogo sex scene for starters its not that the scene in the show is horrible or completely illogical like arya hitting a bullseye its simply a different logical outcome of these peoples relationship think of it in terms of that quantummechanicsstringtheory that states that every single decision we make creates an alternate universe well in one universe dany on her wedding night is effectively raped as she cries in the arms of her new husband the shows version in another universe dany and drogo exchange a few words and dany discovers much to her surprise and pleasure that drogo can be tender and caring and she has wild sex which she enjoys with a man she grows to love the books neither is illogical or crazy they both make a kind of sense i just always preferred the bopok version first for the reasons i stated earlier its the start of a good relationship second it shows a character in the books actually enjoying sex without regrets and without taboos third it shows that dany has feelings and desires of her very own and they are very healthy somebody earlier mentioned that in the books it appeared as if dany was suffering from stockholm syndrome i reject the idea that dany was ever suffering from stockholm syndrome in the books for starters drogo never held dany captive viserys did dany saw drogo as a means of salvation from viserys after a time second she was always treated with respect by drogo most notably in dany given the authority to decide the fates of slaves after drogos last battle something not just unheard of in dothrakai society but in wesetroes society as well finally drogo never engaged in any behavior that would be characterized as an abduction  apart from being married to someone from an outside culture that the bride now must get used to someone else mentioned that in the books drogo would have sex with dany so harshly that it would leave dany raw and therefore the scene in the show is in the same spirit of the books this is not an accurate interpretation and juxtaposition of the two scenes the scene in the show dany is clearly petrified of drogo and absolutely terrified of this new life in the books first dany greatly enjoyed sex with drogo especially in that one scene that begins with drogo saying no and ends with dany saying yes second its a large and wide leap from being sore and raw after sex to being raped while clearly terrified i also understand why the show made this decision danys sense of isolation smallness and helplessness needs to be accentuated over and above trying to establish a real relationship between the two characters dany is far more important that drogo in the grand scheme of the books the show also must develop dany from helpless to all powerful and remember the show cannot go too far into backstory to pull out the terrified child and the house with a red door instead the show must capture danys isolation and intimidation early and often my criticism is that dany loved drogo so that when he is slain later in the book she has a palpable loss she lost the man she loved the father of her child her husband her protector and confidant that loss later is just as important as that child being forcedfucked now yes the show will obviously develop the relationship between dany and drogo from this point onward however now that relationship in the show could very well have the taste of stockholm syndrome and thats a shame still though it makes a sense that cannot be denied and i liked the barbershop scene i like any new scene it adds to the universe and i enjoy this universe edited by rockroi 18 april 2011  1017 am"
"TerraPrime",2011-04-18,"i think the level of nudity is comparable to that in their series rome so its definitely in line with hbo production now whether that amount of nudity exists in martins westeros thats a different discussion im also sore to see some of the best lines in the book cut i know i know they cant keep everything but neds speech on courage and tyrions quip are just so good sigh that one line from tyrion though makes a big difference it makes the screen tyrion less compassionate and less empathetic maybe thats what they want to achieve im also a bit unhappy with the passage of time i find it a bit confusing and ive read the books dont know how the nonreaders are picking up on that also i do not like what they did to cat as a character i can barely see any of the cat that i know from the books in this episode very disappointed"
"MindLikeWarp",2011-04-18,"no because theres not freaking anglo in westeros or anywhere else in martins worldcome on here were watching a tv show there are clear visual differences and our world and martins world deals with that you cant ignore what happens in our world are you telling me they just happen to cast darker skinned people as the savages and it just so happens that in our actual world there are similar perceptions is that what is in the book yes even more significantim not speaking about any one individual but our society as a whole and i guess i should say i can only speak for america you have to be seeing westeros as the dominant culture and being portrayed as the most sophistacated most organized and most technogically advanced in the books there is a strong suggestion of targaryen superiority and i always saw danys takeover of the khalasar as having demonstrated that not that there is anything wrong with that but it is basically like shes going to take control of all the nonwhites to make an army to take over westeros and dont say anything about those cultures being portrayed from her perspective thats an even bigger point the entire series is portrayed from the view of the people with lighter skin which no matter how they end up understanding them they are still an alien culture a side story in the grander scheme of thingsand she comes and takes control of them learns their customs and ways easily and rules them avatar and other movies received similar criticismsand after typing all that i have to say i have no problem with that but i did think that in the book when martin didnt have drogo just take her it played well for him and the dothraki culture and was a positive the right to ones own body is always positive and i dont care if its our world or any world that would be seen as positive and martins choice to actually not have the dark skinned alien people seen as completely savage in that one areait was a positive and different and since drogo at the time especially visually was a representative for all dothraki i think it reinforces actual perceptions we have in our world to have him rape her in the book he didnt and perceptions of the alien dothraki were different more civilized i know the lighter skinned people are portrayed as sexual savages in some regards as well but we see them or will see them on screen far more and know there are different sides to them the dothraki on the other hand are a side story and are framed by moments like that its nice to see the standard raping crazy savage thing wasnt done in the book and i wish it wasnt done here where it later will make her seem like she tamedconquered savages whereas in the book the not raping her turned them into not savages to be tamed but a misunderstood peoples that she grows up with and becomes one with ths show and its raping is making that feeling less so man im going to get ripped apart for this one be nice i am willing to hear anyone out and open to having my mind altered edited by mindlikewarp 18 april 2011  1018 am"

"Balefont",2011-04-18,"come on here were watching a tv show there are clear visual differences and our world and martins world deals with that you cant ignore what happens in our world are you telling me they just happen to cast darker skinned people as the savages and it just so happens that in our actual world there are similar perceptions is that what is in the book yes even more significantthe dothraki in the book are copper skinned with almond shaped eyes i can understand the difficulty with casting an entire people of this description and instead tending to darker skinned people in general it makes perfect sense that they are darker skinned not because they are barbarians or savages but because they live in the open in an area where they are far more exposed to sun than snow and rain there are plenty of barbarians and savagelike people in northern westeros who are light skinned and they are light skinned due to their environment and the ironborn as wellim not speaking about any one individual but our society as a whole and i guess i should say i can only speak for americai think you are blowing these way way to far out of proportion by making even the slightest comparrison to our world let alone americayou have to be seeing westeros as the dominant culture and being portrayed as the most sophistacated most organized and most technogically advancedwhy just because thats all weve seen you cant make this assumption in addition how is westeros more sophisticated more organized more technologically advanced than any place across the narrow sea just because westeros better mirrors old europe and therefore what we as a current culture in the first world are more familiarin the books there is a strong suggestion of targaryen superiority and i always saw danys takeover of the khalasar as having demonstrated thative never interpretted danys coming into her own power as a white superiority issue its her strength as a born ruler and a cunning player of the game that leads to her take over and her dragonsnot that there is anything wrong with that but it is basically like shes going to take control of all the nonwhites to make an army to take over westeros and dont say anything about those cultures being portrayed from her perspective thats an even bigger point the entire series is portrayed from the view of the people with lighter skin which no matter how they end up understanding them they are still an alien culture a side story in the grander scheme of thingsand she comes and takes control of them learns their customs and ways easily and rules them avatar and other movies received similar criticismsicki know the lighter skinned people are portrayed as sexual savages in some regards as well but we see them or will see them on screen far more and know there are different sides to them the dothraki on the other hand are a side story and are framed by moments like thati disagree i think were going to see an even amount across the board because that is how it is in the books edited by balefont 18 april 2011  1047 am"

"spikebrennan",2011-04-18,"a few random observations i generally liked the first episode but dont want to repeat a lot of the same comments that others have already made  in the prologue it wasnt made clear that wights ie reanimated dead bodies and white walkers are two different things the fact that both of them have bright blue eyes reinforces this  not sure how much i like the soundtrack the main theme during the title sort of reminded me of video game music ill see if it grows on me i dont even remember the rest of the soundtrack  flies all over the dead stags face and tongue nice touch  i didnt think that dinklages accent was entirely convincing  it was a bit odd that the lannister sigil was so much more prevalent at roberts arrival parade than the baratheon one  a feather for lyanna hmm wonder what that was about  it was not very obvious that the heart tree is actually inside the castle of winterfell unless you deduce this from seeing the red tree in the establishing shot of winterfell an aerial shot could have helped make it clear that winterfell is so big that there is a whole forest including the pond and the tree within the castle walls  i like how cersei tries a little bit to be gracious but cant help herself and keeps saying extremely condescending things  i found it very difficult to understand the lines delivered by rory mccann sandor when he spoke it may have helped if they had used a tighter twoshot of him and dinklage rather than a wider shot of them that was taken from farther away  my wife wondered about benjen attending the feast if will was executed as a deserter for leaving the wall then why did benjen get to go it could have been made clearer that benjen had been granted temporary leave as it were to attend his brothers event  its from the eyrie the what a few more words could have explained that the eyrie was jon arryns seat of power speaking of which we know that both robert and ned loved jon arryn but it isnt explained that they grew up together in jon arryns care  there were a few oneshots of jory but no explanation or even a suggestion of who he was or what he was doing there  i liked the fact that the lines in dokrathi were completely unsubtitled or translated this helped reinforce the fact that dany had no real idea what was going on  when dany was led to the white horse it wasnt really that clear that the horse was drogos gift to her"
