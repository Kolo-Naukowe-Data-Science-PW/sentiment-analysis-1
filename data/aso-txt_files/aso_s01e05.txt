"Ran",2011-05-15,"so whatd you think"
"Keltess",2011-05-15,"so whatd you thinki wish they would have completed little fingers quote about whorehouses being a better investment than ships whores never sink with the rest and when they are boarded by pirates the pirates pay in gold like everyone else wouldnt have taken more time much more humorous is this an attempt to give a character we all know is slimy no apparent sense of humor the books were extremely funny at times a little comic relief would not be amiss also loras and renly did i completely miss this in the books though loras was extremely devoted to renly my gaydar never went off opinions anyone"
"TomRag",2011-05-15,"best episode yet also renly and loras were most certainly gay in the books although it was portrayed subtly"
"GSP",2011-05-15,"no that lorasrenly scene was never in the books theyve been doing a good job with a lot of these could have happened scenes that serve to explain a lot in a quicker form than how it went in the books renly in the books did not seem to be half of the wuss the series is making him out to be i always pictured him as being a lot manlier than the boyish loras there was no indication he was squeemish over blood for one he seemed like he was supposed to have been a competent warrior in his own right not elite by any means but no joke the series also made it very clear it was varys and illyrio down in the basement that arya overheard the books seemed to me to suggest that was who is was but left it a little ambiguous iirc i guess i can consider that confirmed when next i do a re read this episode finally did some justice to what a giant of a beast gregor is you can see that sandor was a big guy but he looked miniscule next to his brother"
"Xray the Enforcer",2011-05-15,"also loras and renly did i completely miss this in the books though loras was extremely devoted to renly my gaydar never went off opinions anyonere renly and loras yes it is in the books that they are gay lovers grrm has separately confirmed it its somewhere in the so spake martin database that said lots of people have missed the different cues as to the nature of their relationship  you are not the only one smilegif classbbcemoticon alt "
"End of Disc One",2011-05-15,"first 10 of the season fantastic the robertcersei scene was a bit odd as a reader but otherwise no complaints"
"Abaddon",2011-05-15,"im struggling between an 8 and a 9 voted 8 but i will probably replace it with a 9 later i was worried about ned stark chuck norris but the final sequence worked really well for me i was holding my breath during the fight and it was just electric loved jaimes expression of being torn between surprise that he wasnt beating ned and irritation that the guardsman interfered the transition to the eyrie was abrupt but lord its gorgeous did not like the external view of the mountain as it just looked fake but after that everything else about the scene was stunning lysa and the breastfeeding of sweetrobin were appropriately creepy i practically lold at the expressions on the faces of tyrion catelyn et all as they watched her gross"
"YoDaddy",2011-05-15,"after being thoroughly dissapointed in last week i am ecstatic over this one it seemed to convey a lot of the story without all the crazy shifts from place to place which reads well but hasnt translated to the shows for me for the first time in the series it feels like we are getting to meat and potatos of the story now if we could convince hbo to go with 90 minutes i gave this show an 8 the series so far has been only about a 6 in my ratings but i feel like we are about to be getting into the really good stuff from here on out"
"Lord Godric",2011-05-15,"i feel like every episode improves over the last and this one was the best of the season by far i gave it a 10"
"skins7778",2011-05-15,"i give it a 9 the fight between jamie and ned was great i was on the edge of my seat through it its funny i thought the same thing when i saw jaimies expression i actually enjoyed the add on scenes especially the littlefingervarys scene lysa breast feeding was super creepy and sets her up nicely as the nutjob she is i was excited to see one of my favorites in bronn but we didnt get a blackfish sighting im not 100 percent sure but i thought he was introduced prior to the ascent to the eyrie was he not"
"tybeechris",2011-05-15,"i guess i am in the minority i didnt care for this episode very much i thought the scene with robert and cersei was kind of worthless and filler i dont see why they have introduced this lost baby story and if anything it makes her more sympathetic which just seems so out of character from the books maybe it is a red herring so that she will not be suspected in roberts death but i still dont like it i wish they had spent the time on sansa to show more of her inner conflicts they need to show her still believing in a little bit of a fairy tale so that when she leaks the escape plans it is more heartbreaking for us i guess they needed the lorasrenly scene to show him as a viable king candidate but once again i think the time could have been better spent at the eyrie or on sansa oh well as long as the ratings are good so that we can get 5 more seasons i will be happy"
"Carldog",2011-05-15,"i like to wait a day before i vote but gave it a 9 great episode best one yet"
"nim",2011-05-15,"an hour never goes by so quickly as it does during this show gave it an 8 as always tyrion delivers his lines flawlessly and whoa was not expecting full frontal on theon also like that bronn already comes off as a very fluid and savvy fighter sean bean still annoys me edited by nim 15 may 2011  1135 pm"
"thistlepong",2011-05-16,"im wavering between six and seven theres a lot more sexposition shoehorned in jaime won my partner over a little with his reaction to the interference the action scenes even the wtf faces at the eyrie tell the story more effectively so far"
"GrimTuesday",2011-05-16,"an excelent episode to be sure id say a 9 mostly because i feel that they made a mistake by not drawing the tornoment out and using it to introduce characters who while not of much importance in this bookseasons are considerably more important in the coming booksseasons"
"Lord Godric",2011-05-16,"i give it a 9 the fight between jamie and ned was great i was on the edge of my seat through it its funny i thought the same thing when i saw jaimies expression i actually enjoyed the add on scenes especially the littlefingervarys scene lysa breast feeding was super creepy and sets her up nicely as the nutjob she is i was excited to see one of my favorites in bronn but we didnt get a blackfish sighting im not 100 percent sure but i thought he was introduced prior to the ascent to the eyrie was he nothe was one of the people to greet catelyn but the blackfish has not been cast and will not be in season 1"
"TheEvilKing",2011-05-16,"9 from me not quite perfect but still very enjoyable and a big improvement over last week"
"Daenerys",2011-05-16,"first 10 of the season fantastic the robertcersei scene was a bit odd as a reader but otherwise no complaintsi absolutely loved that scene first of all it really humanizes both of them while allowing that they both have faults secondly it gives you a good sense of just how long theyve been enduring one another and how things could have grown so cold between them thirdly it spells out exactly why the dothraki invading would be such a dangerous scenario something i actually wondered about previouslygreat episode best yet i give it a solid 9slightly offtopic question why is danys child considered so dangerous when theres already an existing more direct targaryen heir in viserys is it because they all know veserys is so weak he wouldnt be a serious threat i never understood that from the books and i never got it from the tv series either"
"Hyper",2011-05-16,"a 9 from me best episode yet the jaimened fight  although different from the book  was very well done as was the cerseirobert scene only nitpick the eyrie location looked a bit too extreme for some reason i never pictured it that way  and never on top of such an extreme mountain top something half the height would have looked more realistic but the effects work was great  wonderful sky cells bowdowngif classbbcemoticon altbowdown  edit i forgot to mention the great effects show as arya comes out of the sewers into the blackwater docks gives a nice look at the keep and that location should become very important at the end of season 2 smilegif classbbcemoticon alt  edited by hyper 16 may 2011  0244 am"
"TheEvilKing",2011-05-16,"slightly offtopic question why is danys child considered so dangerous when theres already an existing more direct targaryen heir in viserys is it because they all know veserys is so weak he wouldnt be a serious threat i never understood that from the books and i never got it from the tv series eitheri guess because its a possible male heir for viserys that seems important in determining whether to support a king also if viserys is killed during the invasion then the targaryen sympathisers can still rally around the new kid as a candidate for the throne"
"Ghost Cat",2011-05-16,"i never clued into the relationship between renly and loras until my 3rd read through im not sure we really needed to be slapped in the face with it either i too never read into renly being so weak kinder perhaps than others in the kingdom but not weak or afraid of blood thats what bothered me it does seem that things done subtly in the books are whacked about our heads in the series i wasnt keen on the eyrie except the sky cells that was beautifully done how are they going to handle the door if the series gets that far even though this lysa is skinny shes got the crazy down pat loved hound vs mountain and nedd vs jaime those were well done i gave it an 8 it had a 10 from the nudity but then the renly scene brought it down"
"valacirca",2011-05-16,"lol spoiler they say its impregnable give me ten good men and some climbing spikes and ill impregnate the bitch"
"Loras",2011-05-16,"i loved this episode rated it a 910  my highest rating so far i actually really liked the departures from the book renly being afraid of blood was quite a nice nuance to his character and i felt it put his relationship with loras on a more even keel than the way i felt it was portrayed in the book i think that this will have a good pay off further down the line and is nice set up for what transpires in the next few episodes the other departure that i love is the redefined relationship between cersei and robert the fact that they had a son which died  im happy that i called cersei being sincere in the episode 2 thread the scene between them had been hyped a great deal in the media but for me it really payed off with cersei gaining a greater depth than she does in the book the eyrie was beautiful the set designers on the series have done such an excellent job of giving each location its own distinct feeling and the eyrie may be my favourite so far although i am intrigued by the moon door and how that part of the story will play out the new title sequence showing the eyrie was great i think next week is going to be a riot with the scenes set in this location jorys death was horrific sadgif classbbcemoticon alt  i didnt feel the same emotional connection to it as i did in the book though id have loved to see ned crawl over to the body as the final image ser barristan continues to impress what excellent casting his scene with ned at the beginning of the episode was another stand out in an episode full of stand outs i wish that sansa had been developed further in this episode an opportunity missed i think the actor playing bran is doing a fantastic job but the character is starting to grate on me finally a note on the fantastic chemistry between gillen and hill  im looking forward to their interactions so much as the series continues"
"Max Stark",2011-05-16,"great episode i liked it much better than episode 4 and rated it somewhere between 8 and 9 mostly because they focused on kingslanding and stopped this weird scene by scene story telling of last week i liked the scene between robert and cersei seemed to be authentic and quite interesting what they thought about their political marriage while loras shaving renly seemed to be toally unnessecary also the fighting scenes were done quite well all in all it felt complete even without dany and jon dont get me wrong i like their acting well enough but it was a wise choice to leave them out of this one by the way funny thing even without a single targaryen on screen the dothraki threat seemed to be much more present and real than in all of the last episodes together"
"ABeauty",2011-05-16,"i really liked this one with the exception of seeing more of alfie allan than i really wanted or needed to the added in scenes were all very believable in my opinion and confirmed things that were only hinted at in the books aside from the robcersei baby bit the scene between varys and littlefinger was delicious i cant think of anything here that i disliked  lysa was how i pictured her i never had her as fat in my mind and there was definite ick factor my bund wondered how they got that poor kid to film that even with a fake breast bet theyll show that at his wedding it seems to be really building momentum now so fingers crossed for the final 5 episodes"
"Arbor Red",2011-05-16,"i thought it was a great episode and the pacing finally felt about right i particularly like what theyre doing with jaime in the series in the books you dont really get much from him until book 3"
"M'lady Cynthia Rayder",2011-05-16,"i thouight it was great too i just finished reading got yesterday so a few things puzzled me the lorasrenly scene was one of them so far i have yet to know that they are gay from what i heave read also i had no idea they had a relationship so that was a shocker the theon sex scene was great and a full frontal view wast bad either lysa and he little boy wow thats just crazy just how i pictured it in the books i would have liked to see a bit more sansa as well others mentioned that same thing i also wonder why the mention again of the dead baby between robert  cersei it builds a bond between them but of course as a new reader to the series i wonder if this is setting the way for more to come"
"cypselus",2011-05-16,"best so far by far a 9 it had action was wellpaced quite funny and no dothraki the new scenes were all compelling in their own way especially the robertcersei scene i thought the fights looked a little cheesy but that is a small thing my wife asked me why no one thought it strange that jaime was unmarried apropos of his incestuous relationship so i had to explain the kingsguard the show hasnt made that rather important bit of exposition clear"
"Huan",2011-05-16,"i thought the pacing and feel of the episode was the best so far no quick switches between locations due to only have two locations to switch between made me realize that as good as the show is it could have been even better if theyd had more time eg 12 episodes for the first season echoing what someone else said i wish theyd had ned crawling over to jory at the end of the episode but otherwise i thought the fight outside the brothel was very well done my feeling on the fact that the scene was in full sunlight is that theyre trying to achieve a unique atmosphere for each location and rain doesnt fit for kings landing  its all bright sunlight and glare to contrast with darker colder and wetter winterfell or the wall"
"Lady Luffa",2011-05-16,"i guess because its a possible male heir for viserys that seems important in determining whether to support a king also if viserys is killed during the invasion then the targaryen sympathisers can still rally around the new kid as a candidate for the thronei think that they are bigger threat now with the child because not only is it an heir to the targs but also to the dothraki with a child the bond of marriage has become a real blood bond much harder to break than for example a childless marriage edited by lady lufa 16 may 2011  1021 am"
"julandro",2011-05-16,"we 5 episodes i have to say that from my point of view hbo if they are cut into the sex scenes i fear that the chain has been limited and did not want to extended longer let us not deceive us i expected more"
"Tywin",2011-05-16,"some spoilers in my review for potential nonbook reading viewers beware apologies i dont know how to hide stuff with spoiler tags etcanywaybest episode thus far in terms of pacing a few tiny things bothered me but they were miniscule overall i give this a 8favourite bits mountain smacking loras from his saddle and the hound stepping in littlefinger and varys banter in the throne room end fight outside of littlefingers brothel between ned and jaime arya seeing the dragon skull anything tyrion says and bronn kicking arse lysa being suitably weird just how i pictured her not quite how i pictured the eyrie but cool nevertheless totally how i pictured the sky cell thoughgood additions not from the booksthe scene with cersei and robert i felt was well done for fleshing robert out a bit more than just a drunken lout i think i think it was an understated pivotal moment personally in showing how loose everything is held together in terms of the power in westeros  also gave cersei a bit more substance beyond her being a bitch less necessary in the book but vital i think for a tv formatthe scene with theon and the prostitute provided some good exposition that shows hes got a chip on his shoulder feels he has something to prove and will make his actions later on resonate all the moreminor annoyancesloras and renly it made renly come off as too soft and unsure of himself i think though that from the angle of a tv series its good for ratings to show that gay characters exist  makes the world seem more multidimensionalthe scene went on a bit too long though the gayness was made too blatant and it over emphasised an aspect of renlys character that was never there in the books his whole fear of blood etc i suppose this sets things up for when he does go to war though later on  to show he has something to provesansa needs more exposition i think i think more evidence of her realising her ideas of gallant knights and pretty gowns are childish fantasies in light of whats going on is needed edited by tywin 16 may 2011  0229 pm"
"LadyStormHeart",2011-05-16,"my favorite episode so far i absolutely love peter dinklages portrayal of tyrion  seriously he steals pretty much every scene hes in i also was not expecting fullfrontal theon hello i loved the scene between loras and renly i still cant believe that after reading the books 3 or 4 times i never picked up that they were gay i found that theory on the boards and on the last read through i finally caught the signs i do think they are making renly out to be a wuss but im ok with it also the scene between cersei and robert was excellent the only thing i dont really care for is that they seem to be trying to make us sympathetic towards her and i cant quite figure out why but either way great so far the series gets better and better with each episode"
"valacirca",2011-05-16,"this one felt like an 810 for me i didnt exactly like the episode as much as most of the people here seem to have liked it but one thing that the episode certainly had going for it is that it was the most focused episode thus far no wall scenes no dany scenes it made the episode feel tight and wellpaced one thing that i felt while watching this episode though i found myself thinking that there are too many scenes throughout the show that merely consisted of two characters purely engaging in a dialogue to move the story forward lazy screenwriting imo"
"Sancho",2011-05-16,"i am very much disappointed with this weeks entry i feel like the sloppy writing and directing led to action sequences without the proper atmospheric buildup and to heavyhanded exposition and characterization lacking both depth and subtelty let me elaborate gregor vs loras the tournament sequence felt out of place in this episode it should have been edited into episode 4 instead as it would have provided more thematic unity also we just saw a total of two jousting matches spread over two episodes so its hard to get emotionally invested maybe if we saw jory sandor and jaime joust in other rounds and had a setup of the tournament structure in general it wouldve played out better as it was yes we saw a big dude behead a horse but it lacked the emotional impact that it couldve had loras and renly thanks hbo for browbeating the viewer with their gayness was that really necessary an ambiguous glance wouldve been enough instead we get littlefinger publicly outing the lovebirds but wait lets also have loras shave renlys chest and just in case that chestshaving might not be obviously gay enough let us also have loras suck renly off and lets add some slurping sounds for good measure overkill much theon and ros ummm more exposition meets sexwithawhore except that we learned nothing which we didnt already know from last weeks tirade with tyrion and from this weeks bran and luwin mythology exposa waste of scene topped off with gratuitous fullfrontal nudity littlefinger vs varys yes we know that they are both operators with many spies it was already established do we need a pissing contest where they try to outdo each other in their sneakiness my spies saw you and ned well my spies saw you and ned first well my spies saw your spies see my spies out of character for both varys and littlefinger ned and jaime fight jory getting killed shouldve had more emotional impact instead we get a flashy bladeineyesocket stabbing that ultimately left me cold bad direction tyrion and cat arrive at the eyrie yes we get that lysa is batshit crazy but it mightve been more effective to establish her crazyness a bit more gradually maybe stretch out the entry into the castle in a way as to make the breastfeeding 4 year old more effective instead we get a cut from a previous scene and bam breast again poor execution cersei and robert one of the rare scenes that i liked this week the great delivery from mark addy contributed some much needed depth to the kingqueen dynamic in summary this episode and unfortunately the series in general felt like it was rushing trough various plot points the character development scenes lacked subtlety and i felt like i was being clobbered with character motivations and relationships instead of being allowed to feel them out trough action and natural dialogue a well acted facial expression can communicate more than 5 minutes of exposition i hope that i will be proved wrong but i have lost faith in this adaptation 510"

"Bronn Stone",2011-05-16,"7 too heavy on combat tournament got shortshrifted trip to eyrie far too rushed"
"Nine of Spades",2011-05-16,"slightly offtopic question why is danys child considered so dangerous when theres already an existing more direct targaryen heir in viserys is it because they all know veserys is so weak he wouldnt be a serious threat i never understood that from the books and i never got it from the tv series eitherviserys is still a beggar looking for an army in their mind the son of a khal wouldnt have to beg though in truth thats assuming westerosi customs"
"Songlian",2011-05-16,"i gave it a 7 though it was more like 75 as others have said before the pacing and editing was really good i loved the jaimened fighting scene and every little bit of the hands tourney short as it was it was grrreat on the not so good side i think they are exaggerating with the nudity did we really needed to see theon banging ros i suppose that was essential for the plot somehow since the entire scene lasted about as much as the feast at winterfell did i dont agree that it was for showing theons character didnt tyrion pressed sufficiently on that in the last episode jaime to jory too and even theon stating it vaguely at one point to bran ok so the guy has self esteem issues nuff with the angst stuff already in that same note  scenes that lasted too long and dont bring that much to the story  varys and littlefinger robertcersei i wish they would have used that time to bring out more details from the scenes that were actually in the books though i do see how the cerseirobert one explains a few things and i liked it lots edit why they spilled out the gay factor between loras and renly right from the beginning its beyond me edited by songlian 16 may 2011  0344 pm"
"GSP",2011-05-16,"too heavy on combat seasons two and three definitaly wont be up your alley then honestly i cant wait till the gloves come off without combat any given fantasy series is just a soap opera while wearing swords"
"Aoife",2011-05-16,"all the comments about the slurping make me wonder if people missed those during tyrions scene in ep1 they werent from him drinking or they would have stopped when he did or if its somehow different if the slurper is male other than that this was by far my favourite of those weve seen up to this point i think cutting out a couple of locationsstorylines really helped bring everything together and yes i mean that even with the additional material providing enough time that we probably could have jumped back over to one of those storylines  i think the new scenes didnt disrupt anything as much as a pov shift would have the only things i didnt like were the things i mentioned in the epspecific discussion thread the first anyway first i dont think lf would have been that open about taunting renly at the joust  loras and renlys relationship was an open secret that means that 1 its unlikely that most people who mattered at the tourney wouldnt already have been aware and 2 lf wouldnt have been bandying about something so widelyknown it just doesnt seem his style anyway at least not oneonone secondly something about the lorasrenly interaction and personalities seems off to me i always saw renly as more gregarious and charming and less full of selfdoubt okay i can buy that hes never thought of being king and loras is the more ambitious of the two i just dont see either tv interpretation as the type to inspire the admiration they seem to get in gotthebook i also dont see this renly as being lorass sun but maybe that will become more obvious as we get more interaction between the two onscreen"
"Holymoly",2011-05-16,"best episode yet without a doubt the best scenes were actually those that didnt appear in the book because they actually added to and explained much of the subtext so well the scenes between littlefinger and varys and robert and cersei were suberb not so sure the relationship between renly and tyrel was quite so blatant or neccessary in the books though"

"Kalbear",2011-05-16,"this was my first 10 and definitely great the new scenes were largely brilliant including the amazing cerseirobert scene the book adaptations were downright horrific and awesome horse getting decapitated on screen holy fuck neds chastisement was grand aryas encounter with illyrio and varys followed by her smacking the fuck out of two guards was incredible and i didnt miss danyjon for a second peter dinklage is so incredible as tyrion and the cattyrionbronnlysa interactions are awesome i only vaguely didnt like the loras casting but that was really a minor quibble i cant wait to watch it again"
"Daenerys",2011-05-16,"things that irked me didnt like sandor keeping his fist raised with loras i dont remember that being in the book i feel like book sandor would have scowled spit at loras not the king and stalked away angry at having been forced into a conflict not of his own making for this creampuff knight who he wouldnt respect loras is bad hes not nearly as beautiful as hes supposed to be in the books making sansas swooning a little hard to believe but the dude has an uncut toothpick body i dont see how hes a master swordsman or can even hold up the jousting lance frankly he looks ridiculous as a great knight in his armor again i think he should look more like this renly too small and weak not charismatic or confident enough scene between varys and littlefinger went on too long and set them up as much more outwardly confrontational than in the book could be an interesting take on it but i dont think its needed to show it that way i feel like they both work behind the scenes and wouldnt want to give away any information they didnt have to including knowledge about each other didnt like the lighting when arya was hiding int he dragon skull scene should have been darker mostly torchlight but at the same time i thought the skull was not at all obviously a dragon skull even in hd would people who havent read the books even recognize it as such nedjaime fight should have been in the dark and in the rain not yet another sunny palmtree day in kings landing yeah plotwise it doesnt really change anything horribly i just thought they missed an opportunity to set a great mood there think about the fight between rutger hauer and harrison ford at the end of blade runner would that scene have had the same impact in sunny dry daylight the storm has started with this fight this is where it all really starts going downhill they should have had the environment play a role in reinforcing that the long shot of the eyrie kind of cool but i always pictured it carved into the side of a cliff instead of as a freestanding structure not sure why the moon door should be a hole in the floor for one thing its a waste of space just doesnt seem as practical as an actual door in the wall the tournament still looks terribly small and cheap i guess its over now cant tell like episode 4 they didnt really give many clues as to where were at with it people advancing being officially crowned as champion etc we visit it randomly a couple times to fit in some key scenes but thats it it seems forced in branluwin scene game of thrones the board game seemed a little off and unnecessary i get that they were trying to lay out the landmapfamilies for people unfamiliar with the world but it was clumsy and boring for me what was the point of ned going to see the other robert bastard the baby he already knows about gendry isnt that enough ok he saw the baby fine it doesnt really prove anything more than he already knew even if the baby actually is roberts its the word of a whore after all and you cant really see that it looks like robert and he did this while he must have known his family would be in increasing danger with each passing minute he has his daughters isolated in their rooms and posted his best guards there feels like ned visiting the whorehouse again was a lazy excuse to set him up for the jaime fight not brought on by true motivationsthings i liked everything else was completely awesomei just wish they would think about each scene and try to think what simple things could we do to make this more dramatic or clear or is this scene even necessary there are small things that could be changed or added that would improve scenes but it seems like they just didnt take the time to ask those questions in every casestill great episode overall"
"Tywin's bastard",2011-05-16," what was the point of ned going to see the other robert bastard the baby he already knows about gendry isnt that enough ok he saw the baby fine it doesnt really prove anything more than he already knew even if the baby actually is roberts its the word of a whore after all and you cant really see that it looks like robert and he did this while he must have known his family would be in increasing danger with each passing minute he has his daughters isolated in their rooms and posted his best guards there feels like ned visiting the whorehouse again was a lazy excuse to set him up for the jaime fight not brought on by true motivationsthat scene was pretty much word for word from the book other than that in the book its played out in eddards head as hes riding back from the brothel even the whore looked just like the book described her the reason why the scene is there is thus best directed to grrm himself but spoiler no its not enough seeing gendry one child doesnt prove anything as even siblings from the same parents can look differently just as sansa and arya doesnt look much alike at all the whole case against roberts children is that every single bastard robert has fathered looks just like him regardless of how their mothers looked while his supposed true born do not"
"Keltess",2011-05-16,"the scene between cersie and robert bothered me because and i know someone will correct me if my memory fails me didnt cersie say in the books that robert had got a child on her once and she had gotten rid of it  you cannot make a character as ruthless as cersie sympathetic because she is a complete and total scheming power hungry narcissistic bitch as far as robert goes power just seems to have corrupted a man who was a doughty fighter and perhaps charismatic leader ned is obviously shocked and disappointed by the changes in a man he thought of as his brother too bad he didnt twig a little earlier might have saved himself and his family"
"SerArthurHeath",2011-05-16,"9 great episode with some very strong scenes performances and dialogue would be 10 but as much as im trying to ignore it because it shouldnt matter so much i am really annoyed at the way they did jaime vs ned i knew it was coming but i genuinely think as i have stated too many times on the spoiler thread that it will negatively affect all future seasons to a large enough degree to be considered a calamitous decision"
"arrowfan",2011-05-16,"gave this one a 7 wasnt my fav ep the scene with renly and loras was too much a departure from the book and didnt seem to add much i most certainly did love the scenes en rout and at the eyrie the battle with the wildlings was pretty tight and gorey it had impact probably my fav shot of all was tyrion looking over the edge of his skycell weeeeee varys littlefinger and ned all have great on screen chemistry was a coming out for theon pun intended at first i didnt like this casting but now i think its quite good his face and acting really match his character type and story arc was fun to finally seehear some more sandor hopefully they wont keep stealing his lines giving them to other characters like last ep"
"Elrick",2011-05-16,"man the actor that plays gregor clegane is perfect the guy just seems completely and utterly psychotic how he went off on loras btw i disagree with those that say loras isnt buff enough as ive always pictured him not having a lot of muscle but rather trim and some what athletic looking renly on the other hand is not how i pictured him but that doesnt bother too much as it would be a hard thing to find the exact right look in my opinion also the ideal that renly and loras scene as being a major departure of the books i disagree with in essence as i understand why they did it this way for one tha audience who havent read the books wouldnt pick up on the hints in the books about their sexuality it didnt bother me as much as i knew some who had no probs with men doing women would bottom line great so far gave it a ten edited by elrick 16 may 2011  1006 pm"
"Carldog",2011-05-16,"things that irked me really you thought this ep good doesnt sound like it didnt like sandor keeping his fist raised with loras i dont remember that being in the book i feel like book sandor would have scowled spit at loras not the king and stalked away angry at having been forced into a conflict not of his own making for this creampuff knight who he wouldnt respect loras is bad hes not nearly as beautiful as hes supposed to be in the books making sansas swooning a little hard to believe but the dude has an uncut toothpick body i dont see how hes a master swordsman or can even hold up the jousting lance frankly he looks ridiculous as a great knight in his armor again i think he should look more like this renly too small and weak not charismatic or confident enough scene between varys and littlefinger went on too long and set them up as much more outwardly confrontational than in the book could be an interesting take on it but i dont think its needed to show it that way i feel like they both work behind the scenes and wouldnt want to give away any information they didnt have to including knowledge about each other didnt like the lighting when arya was hiding int he dragon skull scene should have been darker mostly torchlight but at the same time i thought the skull was not at all obviously a dragon skull even in hd would people who havent read the books even recognize it as such nedjaime fight should have been in the dark and in the rain not yet another sunny palmtree day in kings landing yeah plotwise it doesnt really change anything horribly i just thought they missed an opportunity to set a great mood there think about the fight between rutger hauer and harrison ford at the end of blade runner would that scene have had the same impact in sunny dry daylight the storm has started with this fight this is where it all really starts going downhill they should have had the environment play a role in reinforcing that the long shot of the eyrie kind of cool but i always pictured it carved into the side of a cliff instead of as a freestanding structure not sure why the moon door should be a hole in the floor for one thing its a waste of space just doesnt seem as practical as an actual door in the wall the tournament still looks terribly small and cheap i guess its over now cant tell like episode 4 they didnt really give many clues as to where were at with it people advancing being officially crowned as champion etc we visit it randomly a couple times to fit in some key scenes but thats it it seems forced in branluwin scene game of thrones the board game seemed a little off and unnecessary i get that they were trying to lay out the landmapfamilies for people unfamiliar with the world but it was clumsy and boring for me what was the point of ned going to see the other robert bastard the baby he already knows about gendry isnt that enough ok he saw the baby fine it doesnt really prove anything more than he already knew even if the baby actually is roberts its the word of a whore after all and you cant really see that it looks like robert and he did this while he must have known his family would be in increasing danger with each passing minute he has his daughters isolated in their rooms and posted his best guards there feels like ned visiting the whorehouse again was a lazy excuse to set him up for the jaime fight not brought on by true motivationsthings i liked everything else was completely awesomei just wish they would think about each scene and try to think what simple things could we do to make this more dramatic or clear or is this scene even necessary there are small things that could be changed or added that would improve scenes but it seems like they just didnt take the time to ask those questions in every casestill great episode overall"

"YoDaddy",2011-05-16,"gotta be honest about the renlyloras thing it bothered the shit out of me maybe its because i am a bit homophobic but i dont think it was the sex that bothered me it was in the way renly was portrayed i dont remember him being such a puss in the books he struck me as a fun loving funny and somewhat fearless dude he japed about barristan being old he made fun of his drunken brother and offered ned his help in securing the kingdom in no way did he come off as roberts weak little brother like he did here also isnt he supposed to resemble robert in his heyday as far a loras goes isnt he supposed to be the prettiest man in the realm and have brown hair like his sister this guy falls short now before you trash me for gay bashing im not a big fan of any of the gratuitous sex scenes in any of it do we really need to see everyone naked to get the point across that they are having sex i get the dannydrogo part it shows how dany entrances the big dothraki i also get the cerseijaime one as well we are supposed to see the perverse nature of their relationship and just how fucked up the lannisters are dont get me wrong i love sex and even watch porn but for some reason some of these scenes just make me uncomfortable still stick with 8 rating as i thought it was the best episode so far"
"John (Snow) Doe",2011-05-17,"8 overall id say the best episode yet  the action scenes were a welcome departure from the usual mold and i applaud the decision to focus almost entirely on kings landing and avoid the wall or the targaryen plot line with so much going on less was more in hindsight i guess my criticism of the fight scenes all 3 is that they seemed too short  wouldve loved to see more of bronn in action i also felt the 2 stark guards that got speared went down too easily and jory getting a knife through the eye felt too fabricated and staged and tyrion was supposed to have taken an ax to the mountain men you know from later in agot and acok that hes actually quite formidable in h2h combat the fight choreography and cinematography seemed a bit off to me too mad props on showing gregor killing his horse  its all too easy to opt not to show that but it adds so much flavor i was a big fan of the lorasrenly scene coupled with the winterfell scenes focusing on theon weve gotten some nice setupforeshadowing for season 2 as if there was ever any question of its being produced the robertcersei scene was fantastic  an excellent departure from the book with vivid character development lena heady has said in interviews that her interpretation of cersei is that she once had sincere affection and hopes for her and robert this made the climax of that scene much more dramatic for me  cersei asked robert if she could ever have filled the void left by lyanna and he said no he then proceeded to ask how that made her feel and she took a sip of wine and replied with indifference  in that one shot of her sipping the wine and replying we saw cersei confirm in her head her decision to kill robert i loved it is anybody else disappointed that theyve outed jorah mormont as a spy 2 seasons early"

"Jon Lannister",2011-05-17,"this was the best episode till now i think there were things i didnt like renly  loras showing it so soon its not that im homofobic im actually gay the thing is that there are secrets that should be kept till later i loved littlefingers conversation with varys but there was a small thing in it i didnt like littlefinger knowing about the meeting between varys and illyrio i mean ok littlefinger is very well informed but varys is varys he would never let littlefinger know about his meeting with illyrio robert and cersei seemed too friendly but i liked it last one i loved the scene with ned and the kingslayer but i would put it like in the books raining it would have a greatest impact"

"JJtheCrow",2011-05-17,"i gave the episode an 8 really loved everything about it but am saving my 9s and 10s for future episodes i find all the nitpicking to be hilarious this is an adaptation not adapted by you so of course their will be some things that are different from the way you imagined them sounds like we have quite a few tv writers and directors on this board oh thats right you are not tv writers or directors and please stop saying the writers of this series are lazy what an insult to the hard work that many people have put into this series write your own adaptation"
"The Anti-Targ",2011-05-17,"on first view i was thinking 657 but after second viewing im giving it an 8 fortunately i waited until my second viewing before voting in this thread my only real gripe is renlys characteristation and its not really related to changes from the book per se because im looking at his characterisation from the point of view of someone who doesnt know the books and whether such a person will really think of renly as worthy of the crown so far its a negative nothing to do with the gay thing either that was fine"

"Popgun",2011-05-17,"most of my thoughts on it have been pretty well covered by everyone already so i wont restate them here i have found it surprising though tha most of the reaction was over the gay scene rather than on the scene of sweet robin being suckled by his mother i was trying to spot the special effects in that scene but couldnt it really looks like a 67 year old kid is sucking on a middle aged womans tit edited by popgun 18 may 2011  0525 am"

"Bran's 3rd Eye",2011-05-18,"its hard for me to judge this on such universal terms as a standalone tv show episode it was probably an 8 or 9 as an adaptation of the books squarely a 5 i landed somewhere in between making my overall a 6 obviously a 6 is rather closer to 5 than 9 i think this is attributable to the fact that there were so many detail changes from the books eyrie ned fighting renly gets a hummer etc that i didnt think improved the source materialonly cheapened it somehow im still irked by the fact that hbo felt the need to beat us over the head with renly  loras relationship that smacks of sensationalism  not particularly good storytelling zomg theyre having gay oral sex its so edgy the peeps will love it the same could be said of jorys demise zomg sean bean is a big star we gotta get him fighting the peeps will love it ugh put me in the it was good but not nearly as good as it should have been bucket please"

"Greylander",2011-05-18,"wow the picked nits sure are flying its all well and good to notice and have fun pointing out such continuity errors but if you find yourself saying how obviouseasy it should have been to avoid or correct those errors that stems of a lack of understanding what goes on on the production set they only have so much time and money to shoot reshoot any scene the priorities are to get the story lines and characterization right  to get the drama or the comedy right then there are issues of lighting camera angles and so forth everyone on the set tries to preserve continuity  actors playing dead bodies no doubt try to be in same position for each shot prop people try to position props and redress the set to match but if in later shots they found they needed people in a different position they do not necessarily have the timemoney to go back and reshoot earlier shots to exactly match the placement of dead bodies in the nedjaime scene is something you only notice by chance because you normally will be focused on ned and jaime and on jory before he dies and becomes just another body on the set i guarantee every movie or tv show you have seen is chock full of these kinds of continuity errors and you have not noticed 99 of them about arya  the bars if you pay attention the gate with the bars is not the way she came from varys  illyrio went the way she came from so she wanted to go a different way she did not necessarily need or want to go through the gate so we can suppose that the lock gave her just enough pause that she decided to go down the stairs instead even if she did need to get through the gate we can imagine she was in a rather panicked state of mind upon hearing someone talk about murdering her father  not exactly thinking clearly still it looks a little odd and im sure someone noticed at some point but buildingpurchasing the gate probably fell the a minor propsset person and it probably was not obvious that she couldnt slip through until they went to shoot the scene at which point is is not time or cost effective to fix it"

"Greylander",2011-05-20,"greylander that was a wellwritten and explained summary of work behind the camera thanks for that sure there were some thoughts i did not think of when writing down my discovery smilegif classbbcemoticon alt  but honestly in one point i am not convinced in my opinion there is absolutely no need to let ned collapse between jory and his victims for he is fighting jaime somewhere far off of his later place of being backstabbed  and why couldnt jaime just ride through a gap in the line of dead lannister guardsmen does he really need 2 meters of open space left and right for it and the guardsmenline arranged as a pile dont get me wrong i fear that now its really going to get nit picking but the scenery is so extremely changed that for me there is really no excuse of lack of time reshots etc as youve stated there can be much fun in accidently discovering goofs and i really dont look out for them on purpose cause that ruins the feeling and flow and thus being drawn into a movieseries  but this particular goofcoping with eventual production issues ruined the scene for me i hope i was able to explain that properly  im not a native speaker i watched it twice and never noticed this thing about the bodies i did notice aryabars but was not much bothered by it i very much doubt many people did notice it for all we know those men were wounded rather than dead and got up or a little bit when the camera wa not on them unlikely sure but whateveras to why who knows that is my point about the complexity of shooting these things when it comes time on set if everything could be planned out perfectly beforehand or if they could do unlimited reshoots after discovering a problem but neither is possible why they chose to place the actors where they did in eash shotreshot who knows the director and photographer have many things to consider and gettign the drama right is most important could ned have fallen somewhere else sure but then where is the sun coming from would it be in the lens for that matter how easy is it to reposition the camera rig to get the necessary angles if we put ned where you suggest is there time for that maybe they planned to have the horse step over the bodies but found it was too hard for costerwaldau to handle and then they did not have time to reshoot or calm the horse down or whateverwhy let something like this ruin the show for you the way i look at it the show is a representation of the events in a story no to to be regarded as if it were footage of actual events so to speak so minor continuity errors when i notice them do not bother me unless somehow critical to the story"

"Ser Greguh",2011-05-22,"the fallacy on display in this thread is that perfectly continuous footage is necessarily a positive trait it can be fun to point out goofs but pretending that fewer goofs necessarily translates to a better overall product is fallacious cinema is shorthand for example if the bars in the dungeon are actually practical ie too narrow for even a child to slip through it becomes impossible to get a good picture and show the actresss face which is more the point of the scene than the logistical details behind whether or not the character could actually pass through bars of that size same goes with the body placement at the end of the kl fight you go for the placement that makes for the best layout of the final image not for the placement that is most consistent with the preceding action"

"Lord Varys",2011-05-16,"as renly and loras are portrayal more intimate in the series than in the books that fact alone could motivate a discussion about them but the really interesting thing in my opinion is that loras is the more ambitious part in their relationship in my opinion that makes really sense and is likely how grrm would have shown it if he had ever shown us renlyloras closely we should keep in mind that renly is betraying both roberts children and his brother stannis when he is declaring himself king as he is not really hating stannis or his nephews and is not even aware of the fact that they are not his nephews technically this decision is a slap in the face of his family and it would be highly unlikely that he made this decision mostly on his own it had to come from the tyrells ie loras who most likely was more than a little turned on by the thought of being the gay dragonknight to a good and decent king renly and we should keep in mind that stannis really has to be some kind of father substitute for renly of course he would have been a bad father but it is confirmed that these two lived at least together at storms end during the rebellion robert himself most likely spent not that much time with renly but stannis sense of duty should have really forced him to monitor renlys upbringing as good as he could from that pov renly crowning himself is really a slap in stannis face anyway i just think that renly and loras deserve their own thread"
"Clariana",2011-05-16,"i see your point my husband who hasnt read the books said loras is ambitious and my reply is well you dont really know because you dont see him up close in the books but yes it may have happened just like that interesting to have grr as a consultant"
"Hyper",2011-05-16,"i approve of them trying to setup renlys ambitions better there really wasnt much to explain it in the books they are certainly doing some heavy foreshadowing with this and the theon scenes for season 2"
"Tywin's bastard",2011-05-16,"i too agree on that it was very suitable to show loras as the ambitious one that drives renly to eventually want to claim the iron throne for himself i dont have any problems with that their relationship is more in focus than in the book either in the book theres no pov that would see that but their story is a very intriguing one as well as bringing along very important events so i support the decision to bring it to life"

"Lone",2011-05-17,"hey all new here i want to echo a couple of complaints one there was no reason to make renly so weak and squeamish a character i feel that there is evidence to the contrary in the books he did fight in tournaments and was known for it even if he was not the most proficient warrior out there whether or not he had a taste for real battle its extremely difficult to believe that he was afraid of blood if his bravado was all an act there would have been some hint that it was all an act also why do they have to be so kinky and overthetop i feel that that is a stereotype and is not at all edgy as i believe hbo is hoping it comes across theres a tendency on tv to make gay characters physically weak and feminine why renly didnt need to have the wussfactor to be convinced by loras of his right to the throne also if loras had kept his shirt on we wouldnt know that he has the body of a sea lion and then theres the fact that loras is not at all the scheming type in the books they did not hint at this either he was consumed with honor and glory in battle not politics this didnt bother me nearly as much as what i felt was a transformation of renlys character though if anything he was narcissistic and magnetic in the books in the show hes just bland and weak anyways it was disappointing in more than a few ways"

"Ran",2011-05-17,"yeah but lorass beautiful to sansa because he is very young and looks it i dont think finn looks at all like a 14yearold but regardless lorasyounglooking should be something to praise in the castingi do like their choice of putting a lot of the impetuous for the plot on loras pushing renly and doing it in large part just because he can and because hed like a war to fight in i dont think thats how it actually was in the books because in the books renly is a lot more concerned about the lannisters and couldnt countenance joffrey on the throne anyways but its a perfectly reasonable take on things"
"Tywin's bastard",2011-05-17,"why should it be some kind of shocking revelation its no big deal and its not shouted out any more than all the heterosexual coupling going on in the show eg theon and the prostitute at the start of this episode which you say was awesomeexactly in context of how the heterosexual sex is just a couple of steps from being porn i actually laugh when i see people say that the homosexual parts were too explicit its so clear to see where these complaints really come from as for the sounds again we heard the exact same things in the first episode"
"Manderly`s Personal Chef",2011-05-17,"i always imagined renly to be much more masculine than he is in the series i mean come on afraid of his own blood loras convincing him to take the crown for his own but i still do like that loras has a bigger role than he did in the book"
"Ormond",2011-05-17,"as i said on the main thread about the episode i have mixed emotions on this issuei can understand the desire to have the presentation of loras and renlys sexuality be more slowly revealed as it is in the books as it does remove some of the fun of figuring things out and i agree that they are playing too much to modern gay stereotypes both by using the shaving of body hair and by showing renly as being both thin and foppish as was said on the main thread loras and renly are a bit too much abercrombie and fitch models to be realistic for the medieval setting and they could have shown just as much intimacy and trust by simply having loras shaving renlys neck and cheeks instead of his chest and armpitson the other hand it is a bit odd to be complaining about the renly  loras scene and not complaining about some of the other added sex scenes in the series it would certainly be possible to impart the information that we got in the viserys and the slave girl in the bath scene or the theon and roz scene without having the soft porn sex but unfortunately thats to be expected because this series is on hbo it seems that hbo has a sexual titillation factor in most of their series and i suspect that the creators of game of thrones knew that they had to include such scenes in order for hbo to be happy its perhaps unfortunate that the definition of adult in visusal entertainment focuses so much on graphic sex but thats the way it is we just cant expect subtlety about any couples sexual relationship in scenes where they are alone in this series"
"smegma",2011-05-17,"ahh i didnt realize there was a thread devoted to loras and renly so better to be posted herejust to reiterate what ive said elsewhere their scene was tame as all hell compared to many in the series the shaving part was a nice touch in my opinion as there was an intimacy there that showed the level of trust and comfort with one another there was even a line about how loras wanted him and not just any other boy these two are in a relationship and for all the shittastic ones in the books it was one of the more loving ones im also glad there was no big reveal it shouldnt be questionable or surprising that there exists gay people in this world especially since the author intended it as such with the exception of a few naive characters everyone in the book seemed to know it the audience should as well it will make the marriage of renly and margarey for political moves all that more apparent the scene also introduces the tyrells in a big get noticed kinda way and set them up for their big power plays that occur later on they are a huge part of the series and its an interesting take to have loras be their first in i actually really like that and considering they were conspiring for robert to marry margarey its not all far of a leapi also think its important to consider the context of these moves the show is really hanging their hat on the power plays that each house is making by showing these designs it is setting up these characters and their families in the game and that everyone has designs on the throne  and taking different routes to get there renlys subsequent declaration and moves will all make more sense and have greater impact later onalso i think they really wanted to make renly vastly different than his brother in a very obvious way loras plants those seeds in his head as to why renly would be the best choice and his aversion to blood is imo symbolic for this renlys distaste of violence  this is not just a younger robert anyway im a big fan of renly in the books and im a total hbo apologist too so take all of that as you will also gethin anthony is super cute and my teenage daughter thought that finn jones was hot tonguegif classbbcemoticon altp "

"smegma",2011-05-17,"yeah not that i want to get into a debate about being gay but it certainly doesnt preclude someone from having been married to a woman or even having children sexuality is a complex thing and there are tons of gay men out there that have fathered children  i know more than a few myself and history has shown that to be the case as well so margery could have been deflowered by renly although perhaps it likely didnt happen i wonder if well get to see maybe a conficted loras and renly in season two  knowing that renly has to eventually do the deed but not wanting him to or something like that"
"Talleyrand",2011-05-17,"i was fine with the scene and mostly ok with loras ambition but like others the portrayal of renly annoyed me i always got the feeling that the rest of the realm thought he was a ladies man because of the way he acted i also thought that he was scared of blood or fighting"
"Tyrionsnose",2011-05-17,"aside from the imagery of the scene i really liked the dynamic they are setting up with renly as a usurper being backed by the tyrells it sets up early that the tyrells have designs on a crown yet another player in the got also littlefinger let it be known that he knows renlys secret further ingraining the image of lf as a much of a player in the espionage and spy game as varys i think this scene will set up lorass rage when renly is killed it also sets up renly approaching ned about seizing the throne that said i could have done wo the sucking noise same as the 1st episode we get it"
"Abaddon",2011-05-17,"as an aside the only thing that took me aback in the rl scene was that renly was scheming to replace robert i may have missed it in the books but i thought renly was very supportive of robert and it was only when robert was removed from the picture that renlys dynastic ambitions surfacedif so its an interesting change from the books its definitely supported by renlys disgust with robert which i also dont recall from the booksdid i miss this or was it different"
"Songstress",2011-05-17,"i think the whole point behind cerseis theres no way margary was a virgin she was married to renly was that the relationship between lorasrenly was not as obvious to all of kings landing as this thread makes it seem if their relationship was more ambiguous  at least in the beginning  it would give cerseis claims more weight but the actual quote from cersei in affc makes it clear she did know renly was gaymace tyrell claimed his daughter was still virgin but cersei had her doubts joffrey had been murdered before he could bed the girl but she had been wed to renly first    a man may prefer the taste of hippocras yet if you set a tankard of ale before him he will quaff it quick enough she must command lord varys to find out what he couldshe just figured as has already been stated that renly would do his duty and consummate the marriage perhaps try to produce an heir if hes going to be king it was a reasonable assumption for her to make even understanding renlys preferences my brother is gay but he was married twice and fathered 4 children before deciding to come out of the closet to our family the only real reason so many people were surprised by renly and loras is that neither of them was a pov character so we never got into either of their heads or got to spend any alone time with them in the novels their relationship was perceived as subtle because they werent hanging on one another in public and people didnt gossip about them incessantly as if it was something shocking however i do agree that while i like gethin anthony well enough im not 100 behind the decision to change renly from the book portrayal im enjoying the show too much to let that nitpick ruin it for me though and i do love the fact that theyre setting up renlys decision to claim the throne in acok itll make so much more sense this way smilegif classbbcemoticon alt "
"Lord Varys",2011-05-17,"i actually like this more insecure version of renly as this much more resembles how renly is shown in agot than the person he is supposed to be renly is best a tertiary character in agot if we say the povs are protagonists and viserys robert littlefinger cersei and the like are secondary characters he may be handsome popular and an average jouster but thats not really important as his dialogue and behavior is very much forgettable he is cowardly yessayer on the small council hes personality is not flashed out in detail by the author and you are very much surprised when he declares himself king at the head of huge army as the author did not tell us that house tyrell is the strongest house in westeros and grrm made also mistakes when describing renly in acok which is also an indication that he did not think that much about this character i dont mean the changed eye color green to baratheon blue but the fact that renly very much contradicts himself when he first considers his brother stannis as an ally and is very much surprised by the siege of storms end and then later reveals that he knew about stannis own bid for the iron throne via lord tarly who received one of stannis letters thats how renly learned that joffrey and his siblings are supposed to be bastards portraying renly as a strong and dashing guy in the series would somewhat contradict the feeling the readers of the books got of this character during their first read renly becomes only an interesting character on a second or third read when you start thinking about what might have happened if renly had not died or acted differently when robert died renly being insecure and unexperienced as a warrior is also a good explanation why tywin and tyrion are going to see him as an rather insignificant threat in the second season although his host outnumbers the lannisters two to one him being the little brother in the shadow of his two elder brothers is also a good motivation for his bid for the iron throne as he was ignorant about the incest he could very well have done this also to finally earn the approval of stannis and roberts shade this is making more sense than the look i am the raingod explanation we get in the books there we are actually lead to believe by the character who knew renly all his life maester cressen that he just declared himself king because he thought it would be fun renlys popularity with the people should in the end be most evident when garlan tyrell as renlys ghost kills people on the blackwater a guy who never did muchany killing in his life returning from death to save the rightful king would be really powerful symbol"
"Tempra",2011-05-17,"on the other hand it is a bit odd to be complaining about the renly  loras scene and not complaining about some of the other added sex scenes in the series it would certainly be possible to impart the information that we got in the viserys and the slave girl in the bath scene or the theon and roz scene without having the soft porn sex but unfortunately thats to be expected because this series is on hbo it seems that hbo has a sexual titillation factor in most of their series and i suspect that the creators of game of thrones knew that they had to include such scenes in order for hbo to be happy its perhaps unfortunate that the definition of adult in visusal entertainment focuses so much on graphic sex but thats the way it is we just cant expect subtlety about any couples sexual relationship in scenes where they are alone in this seriesum people have complained quite a bit about other sexnude scenes does the ass pan of doom mean anything to youhonestly i would have prefered some straight up anal sex as hbo does so well to a cringeinducing shaving scene that scene would be horrible regardless of the sexual orientation of the participants and the slurping sounds are just corny as hell"

"ZombieWife",2011-05-17,"first off i am grossly disappointed in the casting of renly he is supposed to look like a young robert yet leaner and prettier also renly wasnt a complete whiny wimp as he is portrayed so far in the show so what if hes gay he was still supposed to be a capable male character not a wimpy whiner loras looked fine in his armor but with his shirt offthe guy couldnt even lift a lance let alone use one i wouldnt have had any problem with the loras on renly scene if they didnt write renly as such a milktoast and loras all of 115 pounds yes i know loras was supposed to be thin but you can still have some muscle and be thinthink about that loras heading into dragonstone first they wouldnt need to douse him in oil they could just break his back with a poke from a sticki agree with some of the sentiment here but not allfirst im a bit put off by renly so far but not because of the actor i think he looks like addy so no issue there but they arent giving renly much to do    atall there is no depth to him nothing that makes me care for him as a television series character leading up to the loras scene i feel like the actor is a good one but he hasnt been loosed upon the audience yet to show us what hes made of perhaps in season 2i also agree that one can be thin and muscular look at alfie allen granted he is a greyjoy and hes been in winterfell where the young men all have abs of steel and nice pecs smilegif classbbcemoticon alt "
"Ser Warpechowski",2011-05-17,"i approve of them trying to setup renlys ambitions better there really wasnt much to explain it in the books they are certainly doing some heavy foreshadowing with this and the theon scenes for season 2i think they did it now and spent so much time on theon because from now on too much will happen in kl and the dothraki horde that the wall and winterfell will probabily become less important"

"Abaddon",2011-05-17,"i guess it seems substantially different from the book portrayal to me because in the book by the time renly declares himself king1 robert is dead and2 renly knows that all of roberts children are in fact jaimestherefore the only real claim to the throne better than renlys is stannisshere as renly objects hes fourth in the line of succession and theres no reason to think that robert is going to die immediately and even when he does there are three children who have a better claim to the throne remember female children come before male siblings in the books in westeros although that seems to be different in the tv show so lets leave it at two its pretty different to suggest that renly should be king in this scenario compared to when he declares in the bookits not a big deal and one can reasonably suppose that musings were going on behind the scenes earlier however it still makes me think that the tv show renly is a tad bit less loyal to robert and his at this time supposed nephews than the book renly with not a lot of textual evidence to support the latter conclusion admittedly i dont mind that change if it is indeed a change im just more curious about whether anyone sees it as different like i do or not edited by abaddon 17 may 2011  0229 pm"

"xaraph",2011-05-17,"i signed up just for thiswhen i first saw last nights episode i thought wtf it seemed like the tv show was taking an awful lot of artistic license in breaking from the books then i thought about it it really made me reevaluate the books ive read them countless times and never picked up on any homosexual undertones between renly and loras but thinking back it really seems like a strong possibility like all the hints are there just under the surface so in that light i appreciate that the tv show is perhaps more overt with things that may be left unsaid in the books it certainly makes me appreciate martins gift for subtlety"

"Lord of Brewtown",2011-05-19,"but the actual quote from cersei in affc makes it clear she did know renly was gayshe just figured as has already been stated that renly would do his duty and consummate the marriage perhaps try to produce an heir if hes going to be king it was a reasonable assumption for her to make even understanding renlys preferences my brother is gay but he was married twice and fathered 4 children before deciding to come out of the closet to our family the only real reason so many people were surprised by renly and loras is that neither of them was a pov character so we never got into either of their heads or got to spend any alone time with them in the novels their relationship was perceived as subtle because they werent hanging on one another in public and people didnt gossip about them incessantly as if it was something shocking however i do agree that while i like gethin anthony well enough im not 100 behind the decision to change renly from the book portrayal im enjoying the show too much to let that nitpick ruin it for me though and i do love the fact that theyre setting up renlys decision to claim the throne in acok itll make so much more sense this way smilegif classbbcemoticon alt agree with this 100 i wish they hadnt made renly so wimpy  but its not going to ruin the series for me i always got the impression that loras was definitely gay and that they were an item but that even though renly preferred men he might go both ways  wouldnt shy away from producing an heir if necessary i cant remember the passage but doesnt some character comment on or think about rumors of wild parties thrown by renly at storms end cressen maybe or a cat chapter"
"Hooplehead",2011-05-20,"i dont understand all of the handwringing over the tv portrayal of renly hes a pretty minor character in the books who we really dont even see that much hes really there to facilitate the plot with the whole war of 5 kings bit sure i liked his character in the book he was fun and i wish there had been more of him but that really just hammers home the fact that he wasnt there much so if they want to tweak this minor character a bit to suit this slightly different telling of the story on tv i dont have an issue with that it doesnt ruin anything it seems to me like this is being done to facilitate an earlier fleshing out of the tyrells and maybe show that loras is a bit of a schemer himself or at least involved in his grandmothers plans loras is the one whos going to survive at least into the 5th book it looks like so developing him a bit at the expense of a a guy who has a handful of appearances left cant hurt"

"PestilencE",2011-05-16,"i just had it like the edinburgh castle but on a bigger rock i like their version moreah a fellow edinburgher i presumewelcome to the forums smilegif classbbcemoticon alt my idea of the eyrie was pretty much the same as the tv show but more elevated and with more pointy towers i am very satisfied with their rendition edited by pestilence 16 may 2011  0747 pm"
"Anomandaris86",2011-05-16,"i thought the same things and there is all that butthey have a budget to follow im sure that doing the way castles  having a physically impossible eyrie would have been absolutely budget bustingi was assuming it was going to be cgi no matter what do you think the version in the show isnt"

"Jojen",2011-05-16,"ok so we know what everyone thinks of the outside but how about the inside i for one like the throne room particularly the weirwood throne cant imagine its any more comfortable than the iron throne"
"melicorn",2011-05-16,"i didnt think the eyrie was that terrible but it was certainly different than what i would have done i also had imagined it and the mountain it was on to be much taller i dont remember seeing any waterfalls either shouldnt they have been visible also i had always assumed it had much more rough hewn rock so that it was difficult to tell where mountain ended and castle began maybe some kind of combination of this and this"
"Xxtayce",2011-05-16,"i loved the interior budget constraints there may be but theyre making up for a lot of it with symbolic lighting the slightly greenish tinge to the inside of the eyrie definitely gives it the sadistic twisted feeing versus the cold and honorable winterfell setwise it was a little smaller than i pictured in my head  i thought the room would be much larger  but other than that it was perfect"

"Abaddon",2011-05-16,"for me the outside was a bit of a letdown compared to the book too fantastical the rock formation it was built on looks fake the inside both the throne room and the sky cells on the other hand surpassed the book description lovely so cold and perilous"
"melicorn",2011-05-17,"not tall enough if anything i think the mountaincliff it was situated on was too tall  imo im not sure people really grasped the scale from that quick establishing shotas for not being able to tell where the rock ends and the castle begins  only the very tip is the castlethat is true that it was a pretty quick cut ill have to look at some more screen shots to really cement my opinion but i never really got any kind of impression of vertigo and i think thats the most important aspect of the eyriethe interiors were also quite different from what i had pictured but i liked them quite a bit i am looking forward to more scenes there"
"Anomandaris86",2011-05-17,"i was anticipating something more like thishttpxxtaycecomw05theeyriepngyes that"
"MountainThatRides",2011-05-17,"yeah it was a tad too fantasy looked like the cover of a dragonlance book and it certainly isnt the mountaintop fortress that it could have been i understand most of the changes dd are making  either they trim things down for the purposes of plot pacing and to condense what is a very sprawling story or for budgetary reasons like why the conflict between eddard and jaime wasnt on horseback at night in the rain but since they were going to spend the money on a cgi eyrie anyway why not just make it a bit more faithful"
"Tall Tyrion Lannister!",2011-05-17,"i always pictured it being on this huge mountain iirc it takes a couple days of climbing to get the to the top"
"Tywin's bastard",2011-05-17,"im surprised that some say its too fantastical since the eyrie of the book is extremely fantastical to me its just different probably less fantastical if anything given its less extreme location"

"Drychtnath",2011-05-17,"the eyrie is the second disappointment for me up to now in the series the first was the casting of robert baratheon mary addy is turning out to be quite good but im still not convinced he just seems far too small to be robert baratheon they should have cast a larger man for that role i just cant imagine him crushing someone to death with a warhammer hes 5 10 when i was reading the books regarding robert i did not imagine him of an average height i imagined something completely different it should be slanted colourwise towards either white or blue not greenish i just thought it was very badly done its the only production or set issue i have had so far otherwise the rest has been quite good"

"Ser Warpechowski",2011-05-17,"for reference heres how i imagined the eyrie to look like almost down to every detaillinkyagreedmaybe they went for a diferent portray of castles i mean people in europe can see castles like that if they travel a few hundred km maybe that is why they went with a mediteranean aproach to kl and a castle that looks like a temple in the eyriei was a bit disapointed also it looks like too much fantasy i really liked the books because it didnt had much high fantasy stuff"

"SerArthurHeath",2011-05-17,"the mountain is not that big either not to mention ilyn payne who is the ridiculousthe mountain is pretty big  7 foot is plenty big its about 6 inches shorter than the books say but if you can find someone who is 76 and built enough and can act a bit and can sword fight and wants to be involved then you can complain as it is he is considerably taller than every other actor and character so literally nothing is lost he still looks invincible and ing scary payne is a bit off though"
"TrueMetis",2011-05-17,"i always imagined it a being on top a single pillar of rock is that not how it is described in the book shrugs"
"shadow of death",2011-05-17,"to me in the book it seemed the most fantasy of all the castles on the show it seems if someone took out the bridge the people in the castle would be totally screwed"

"Tywin's bastard",2011-05-17,"yeah on a rewatch it doesnt look as bad i originally thought the castle was on multiple pillars like it had legs but now i see its a single block edit no it definitely has legs thats ridiculous imo also that bridge leading to it is pure fantasy look at it again tywins bastard that is a pure fantasy castle the greek comparison is goodthe way it looks in the opening creditsa central dome surrounded by slender towersreminds me a bit of the hagia sophia where are the towers in the show though it looked more like a single buildingthe throne room is awesome it really is reminiscent of an eagles nestthe stone pillar is eroded so its a bit hollowed out but my point firmly remains the book eyrie is certainly more fantastical i never said the show version wasnt fantastical we are actually watching a fantasy show i pointed out that pretty similar things have been built in our medieval times while the book eyrie could not unless you wore out more slaves than the pyramids required and possibly not even then because theres hardly any room to ship up the huge stones that days march up the mountaingrrm definitely tried to make something really fantastical with the eyrie so the fantasy argument against the show version just doesnt hold water if someone doesnt like it thats how it is but to say that its too much fantasy is completely backwards and even more insignificant as the show will actually have dragons"
"Xenophon",2011-05-17,"the stone pillar is eroded so its a bit hollowed out but my point firmly remains the book eyrie is certainly more fantastical i never said the show version wasnt fantastical we are actually watching a fantasy show i pointed out that pretty similar things have been built in our medieval times while the book eyrie could not unless you wore out more slaves than the pyramids required and possibly not even then because theres hardly any room to ship up the huge stones that days march up the mountaingrrm definitely tried to make something really fantastical with the eyrie so the fantasy argument against the show version just doesnt hold water if someone doesnt like it thats how it is but to say that its too much fantasy is completely backwards and even more insignificant as the show will actually have dragonsi dont really see why you think the book version is more fantastic than the show version of the eyrie as far as i can tell the only really unrealistic thing about the bookeyrie is how high it is on the shoulder of the mountain but i agree its hard to speak about what is or isnt realistic in a show with a giant magical wall of ice i guess i just found a castle on what looks like a bunch of legs to be more unbelievable than the other sets for example the impossibly tall towers of the red keep its purely a subjective thing but for some reason a castle on top of a bunch of giant rock columns breaks my suspension of disbelief more than the other fantastic sets"
"King_Baratheon",2011-05-17,"like many the eyrie is my favorite castle in the novels yes it looked completely different in my head than on hbo ted nadsmiths looks amazing very high fantasy yet still not what i imagined first of all the eyrie is supposed to be a somewhat small castle especially by the time you get up to sky i always envisioned it to be tall and slender jutting out of the mountain side neither the show or mr nadsmith captured this on hbo it seemed far to large too round and not high enough it looked awesome it looked impregnable yet it didnt look like it was described in the book i thought with cgi they would at least be able to fashion it in the novels mold yet it looks like they had their own vision of it it was still pretty cool lookin"
"Jonias Snow",2011-05-17,"there are copyright issues so hbo would have to stay away from anything resembling nasmiths version i really like the show version being in architecture their eyrie had a byzantium which i love feel to it and they placed it on a pillarlike rock formation as big as a mountain like many of the monasteries you see in se europe the natural causeway running to the mountain was an interesting choice one i like too the designers obviously borrowed from multiple time periods to create something new that cannot be pinpointed to any time period here which i believe was their intent if you watched the production clips i actually like their design better than nasmith to european maybe cause i have a soft spot for byzantine architecture if you freeze the video you can see small waycastles or gates along the causeway"
"Tywin's bastard",2011-05-17,"i dont really see why you think the book version is more fantastic than the show version of the eyrie as far as i can tell the only really unrealistic thing about the bookeyrie is how high it is on the shoulder of the mountain but i agree its hard to speak about what is or isnt realistic in a show with a giant magical wall of ice i guess i just found a castle on what looks like a bunch of legs to be more unbelievable than the other sets for example the impossibly tall towers of the red keep its purely a subjective thing but for some reason a castle on top of a bunch of giant rock columns breaks my suspension of disbelief more than the other fantastic setsits just one rock column that has been eroded to become hollow but thats really only the very unusual thing that the rock composition seem to be mixed so some parts can erode quicker than others other than that its a castle built in a similar place to where the medieval people of our world actually built things so the fantastical thing is an abnormal rock formationwith the book you have to travel up the mountain for a day on a road so tiny that two people cant even ride beside each other and its straining to do it unburdened all that way they had to transport the immense stones required to build a castle which is sounds to be impossible its also very fantasy to put it an entire days ride up a mountain instead of an hour which frankly would have been a terribly long ride anyway and been way more than necessary to have an impregnable castle especially since no one has even breached the bloody gate theres a lot of fantastical things herei dont disagree that the eyrie looks fantastical in the show i just dont think it stands out in believability that much as you say the wall and the red keep wouldnt be able to be built without magic and i suppose a lot of the old castles were built with magic and some newer as we know dragonstone was done so and thus likely the red keep as well if the design of the eyrie doesnt fully work for you thats not much to say about though we like what we like"

"Xenophon",2011-05-17,"all that way they had to transport the immense stones required to build a castle which is sounds to be impossible its also very fantasy to put it an entire days ride up a mountain instead of an hour which frankly would have been a terribly long ride anyway and been way more than necessary to have an impregnable castlei always figured they just quarried the rock out of the mountainside itself sort of like the incas did in some places but yes having it hours up was fairly unrealisticcan you imagine getting the wine up thereanyway i dont know what it is but something about the outside shot of the tveyrie just looks silly to melike its going to walk away on those legs"
"adamsputnik",2011-05-17,"i dont mind it really it is very difficult for me to picture how it looks in the books i always figured a bunch of high ridges leading to the peak but id have to read the description again to get a feel for it the first time i saw the bridgecauseway i thought that was a bit fanciful but upon reflection it doesnt look so bad although there is no mention of such a causeway in the books im not too fussed though it still looks pretty cool and the view from the sky cells was rad"

"Knight Of The North",2011-05-18,"hmmm im probably in a minority here but i thought that the eyrie was entirely utilatarian  as if it was built for nothing but defence and that everything was suited to making the mountain impossible to take i imagined the actual mountain to be two or three times as wide as the show displayed it to be and the actual castle to be far smaller its a fortress made to beat off any army with lots of little keeps along the road up i just thought the artists went to hell with it and did a pillar castleand ilyn paynei could not stop laughing"
"Tywin's bastard",2011-05-18,"grrm portrayal of the eyrie was quite fantastical but not for the castle but for the natural beautiy surounding it im pretty sure the description of the castle is that its mostly 7 towers barely tied together and that its also the smallest of all the lords castle i just rewatched the scene where the eyrie is show and i had not noticed before buy you can actually see the three gatescastles before the eyrie and they are freaking small compared to how the eyrie look of course its cg and the perspective isnt that great and even in real life whenever you see something extremely big you have problems realizing how big it is but the eyrie in the shots is incrediblely big maybe bigger than winterfelllook at this picture and then look at the scene in the episodehttpimageshackus848eyrieljpgwesteros story is 12000 years old the book eyrie could have taken centuries to be build harrenhall took like 3 generationsif we could do the pyramids we could do the eyrie it doesnt sound as fantastical to meoh and the sky cell was way too bigit doesnt have to be the size of winterfell to be impossible to build without magic they cant get any stone etc up from the bottom because they never built a road large enough to do that and we know they didnt use stone from the mountain because its not the same kind of stone and you dont paint a castle you cant build cranes etc that can lift the stones that far eitherand to say that if the pyramids are possible then the eyrie is possible is just mindboggling the pyramids were built on the ground where you had a lot of room to build all the machinery required to lift the stones to where they should be not on a mountain where theres not even roads to bring the material upand the show eyrie is larger but its still built where there seems to be a proper road which means that you can bring the material up there its not the size of the book eyrie that makes any problems whatsoever its the logistics if you could build a small castle you could build a big one thats just a matter of time"
"Tywin's bastard",2011-05-18,"i always figured they just quarried the rock out of the mountainside itself sort of like the incas did in some places but yes having it hours up was fairly unrealisticcan you imagine getting the wine up thereanyway i dont know what it is but something about the outside shot of the tveyrie just looks silly to melike its going to walk away on those legsbut then the castle would have had to be the same color as the mountain and definitely invisible from where cat first sees ityes we all see things in different ways i still cant see the pillar as legs so thats a reason why it looks better to me"

"ser_nerdick",2011-05-18,"the eyrie was different than the description in the book but i still thought it worked well if i remember correctly the sky cells were described in the book as being almost like a honeycomb structure and as such i pictured a large number of cells we are only shown two  in the show but i think they looked great there was some scribblings on the wall and also what appeared to be a line of water drippingflowing down the center of the cell to the outside which gave it the appearance of having a slightly slanted floor as described in the book i also liked the throne room overall i think they did a great job with the eyrie better than kings landing in my opinion"
"Knight Of The North",2011-05-18,"theres nothing utilitarian about the eyrie its easier to take the only road to the castle than it is to surround a castle built on the ground and theyll starve as well up there as the people at storms end did the only thing you really accomplish with the eyrie is making your own day to day logistics a huge pain so it must have been built on vanityand why would you really need the eyrie to be impregnable no one has taken even the bloody gate and if the bloody gate cant be taken as its described in the book then theres no weight to the argument that the show eyrie wouldnt be able to be called impregnabletrue but you forget the actual army besieging it the surrounding hill tribes the landscape and the conditions of the vale mean that disease weather and supply shortages would annihilate any army trying to starve the eyrie out big caravans of food passing through the hills entire clans would band together to take one mountains mean heavy rain and harsh snow in autumn and winter  there goes any chance of decent quarters storms end sits on the edge of a bountiful farmland while the eyrie sits on the edge of a logistical wasteland any army sitting there would die while the defenders sat and ate their supplies the builders knew this and instead made it invulnerable to assault  the only way a fortress like the eyrie could be takenand just because a fortification has never been tested by no means dictates its purpose it indeed seems likely that the bloody gate the gates of the moon and the eyrie were all built at roughly the same time as they are built with similar architecture centered around gates and towers and sit along the same roadthe idea of building a castle in the mountains for vanity is quite strange why not build it down near gulltown where the mountains are fewer and they have a port within easy reach im sorry but the vanity argument fails to hold water upon close examination"
"Aoife",2011-05-18,"but i agree its hard to speak about what is or isnt realistic in a show with a giant magical wall of ice i guess i just found a castle on what looks like a bunch of legs to be more unbelievable than the other sets for example the impossibly tall towers of the red keep its purely a subjective thing but for some reason a castle on top of a bunch of giant rock columns breaks my suspension of disbelief more than the other fantastic setsnormally i would say the same but i have been thinking about it more  from the exterior shots the eyries great hall  throne room does not appear to be part of any overhang thus for the moon door to work where it is there has to be empty space below it that is part of the mountain itself it all still falls apart if i think about it too long such as building on separate spires to work with or drilling through a natural platform after the castles built to reach empty air but im willing to say thats just enough explanation to suspend my total disbelief"
"Tywin's bastard",2011-05-18,"true but you forget the actual army besieging it the surrounding hill tribes the landscape and the conditions of the vale mean that disease weather and supply shortages would annihilate any army trying to starve the eyrie out big caravans of food passing through the hills entire clans would band together to take one mountains mean heavy rain and harsh snow in autumn and winter  there goes any chance of decent quarters storms end sits on the edge of a bountiful farmland while the eyrie sits on the edge of a logistical wasteland any army sitting there would die while the defenders sat and ate their supplies the builders knew this and instead made it invulnerable to assault  the only way a fortress like the eyrie could be takenand just because a fortification has never been tested by no means dictates its purpose it indeed seems likely that the bloody gate the gates of the moon and the eyrie were all built at roughly the same time as they are built with similar architecture centered around gates and towers and sit along the same roadthe idea of building a castle in the mountains for vanity is quite strange why not build it down near gulltown where the mountains are fewer and they have a port within easy reach im sorry but the vanity argument fails to hold water upon close examinationthe mountain clans are no match for knights otherwise the road to the vale would never be used at all since normal convoys in peace time will have far less guards than a military one you can also strike a bargain with the clans as tyrion did since they hate the vale thats a nonissue for any army that could think of conquering the valeand youre wrong about where the eyrie is situated its the road to the vale thats harsh but the actual vale is very bountiful its described as a huge stretch of rich soil broad rivers and hundreds of lakes once you get there youll have plenty of food to take and thats why they have the bloody gate and thats been all that they have needed save for whatever may have happened when aegon came your argument only works for the shows version because that had nothing but rocksare you actually trying to tell me that the reason they put the eyrie a days ride on a scrawny path up a mountain is that its necessary to be certain to keep it even an hour up the same path would be longer than necessary to have the exact same effect the location of the eyrie screams of hey look what we could accomplish as it has no other function than to impress"

"Knight Of The North",2011-05-19,"the mountain clans are no match for knights otherwise the road to the vale would never be used at all since normal convoys in peace time will have far less guards than a military one you can also strike a bargain with the clans as tyrion did since they hate the vale thats a nonissue for any army that could think of conquering the valeand youre wrong about where the eyrie is situated its the road to the vale thats harsh but the actual vale is very bountiful its described as a huge stretch of rich soil broad rivers and hundreds of lakes once you get there youll have plenty of food to take and thats why they have the bloody gate and thats been all that they have needed save for whatever may have happened when aegon came your argument only works for the shows version because that had nothing but rocksare you actually trying to tell me that the reason they put the eyrie a days ride on a scrawny path up a mountain is that its necessary to be certain to keep it even an hour up the same path would be longer than necessary to have the exact same effect the location of the eyrie screams of hey look what we could accomplish as it has no other function than to impressfor one thing the idea that troop quality is the most important factor when it comes to guarding supply routes is simply wrong see the peinsular war the roman invasion of britain and the spanish reconquista for examples all of these show that ambush numbers conditions and planning are overreaching superiority of local knowledge are far far more important and if the vale lords havent been able to strike up a deal with the mountain clans why would any other lord tyrion only did so because he was desperate and lacked the natural prejudices of most westerosi lords it is the biggest issue for anyone conquering the vale peace convoys are usually dignitaries and periodic trade caravans that stop off along the road and are far less obvious targets than a plump military convoy the supplies neccessary to maintain an army would either have to garrison along the entire road depleting their forces or simply stomach their losses besides  whos to say that the vale lords wouldnt get over their prejudices first with their home being invaded and recruit them firstand i believe the actual soil of the eyrie is so poor that it cant maintain a heartwood  the vale itself may be bountiful but the area surrounding the giants horn certainly isnt and besides  the positions needed to actually stop anyone going in and out would be so ludicrously tight and cramped that the defenders would struggle to adequately pillage the surround countryside simply because they have to keep riding down the mountain to do itand by that same logic why have two walls when one stops people coming in and out an hour is a completely viable march for even a tired soldier a day is not a days march up a steep mountain prevents you from using siege engines it prevents you from coordinating assaults properly and it also gives you plenty of chance to harass them on their way upyour idea that it is built for vanity just simply doesnt make sense for one thing it is small and hard to get to though you may argue that it is there to be seen its size is clearly not made to impress with many of its components spread out and small hardly aweinspiring stuff but it is however very good from a defensive standpoint the most difficult fortification in the world is a stone tower which you cant hurl rocks at which is almost exactly what the eyrie isfurthermore the building styles suggest consistency throughout cultures the lannisters build for glamour and vanity having never suffered much from invaders the starks build for defense and utility due to their wild domain and the threat of the wall it would make sense that if the vale lords built a gate that could not be taken they would build a fortress that could not be taken"
"Tywin's bastard",2011-05-19,"for one thing the idea that troop quality is the most important factor when it comes to guarding supply routes is simply wrong see the peinsular war the roman invasion of britain and the spanish reconquista for examples all of these show that ambush numbers conditions and planning are overreaching superiority of local knowledge are far far more important and if the vale lords havent been able to strike up a deal with the mountain clans why would any other lord tyrion only did so because he was desperate and lacked the natural prejudices of most westerosi lords it is the biggest issue for anyone conquering the vale peace convoys are usually dignitaries and periodic trade caravans that stop off along the road and are far less obvious targets than a plump military convoy the supplies neccessary to maintain an army would either have to garrison along the entire road depleting their forces or simply stomach their losses besides  whos to say that the vale lords wouldnt get over their prejudices first with their home being invaded and recruit them firstand i believe the actual soil of the eyrie is so poor that it cant maintain a heartwood  the vale itself may be bountiful but the area surrounding the giants horn certainly isnt and besides  the positions needed to actually stop anyone going in and out would be so ludicrously tight and cramped that the defenders would struggle to adequately pillage the surround countryside simply because they have to keep riding down the mountain to do itand by that same logic why have two walls when one stops people coming in and out an hour is a completely viable march for even a tired soldier a day is not a days march up a steep mountain prevents you from using siege engines it prevents you from coordinating assaults properly and it also gives you plenty of chance to harass them on their way upyour idea that it is built for vanity just simply doesnt make sense for one thing it is small and hard to get to though you may argue that it is there to be seen its size is clearly not made to impress with many of its components spread out and small hardly aweinspiring stuff but it is however very good from a defensive standpoint the most difficult fortification in the world is a stone tower which you cant hurl rocks at which is almost exactly what the eyrie isfurthermore the building styles suggest consistency throughout cultures the lannisters build for glamour and vanity having never suffered much from invaders the starks build for defense and utility due to their wild domain and the threat of the wall it would make sense that if the vale lords built a gate that could not be taken they would build a fortress that could not be takentheres not much to know about the area because the only thing the attackers are interested in is the road and thats easy to map out quickly as for why the vale hasnt stricken a deal with the clans they havent even been trying the lords of the vale seem to see them as inferior people and since their knights seemingly beat the poorly equipped clan people quite soundly they have no reason to bargain with them why give something to someone when that someone isnt a real threat and what has ever given you the impression that people in westeros are soon to forget old sins especially when the people of the vale dont think any army can even get past the bloody gate a conquering army would probably not have that much trouble with them either but they could always use more men so they might certainly strike a bargain with the clans if they saw it fit that or someone like tywin might just set out the mountain with a strong force to scare them off once and for all while they were besieging the bloody gate then again im not so sure the mountain clans would even try to attack a conquering force they want to see the vale fall because they specifically hate the people of the vale plus that we already know that the clans just vanish when knights are set out to hunt them they dont even try to fight a mighty force which is understandable because poorly equipped warriors will just die against knights theres no question about that they might just bide their timeyoull have to specify where it says that any place in the vale lacks for fertile soil i dont care about transported soil up to the eyrie thats irrelevant to this point when catelyn rides through it we are only told how wonderful the land is and even if the area around the giants lance had been less fertile thats no problem since you dont need to steal provisions from exactly where the host sits i dont get at all what youre talking about the besiegers riding down the mountain the entire point of the eyries position is that you dont have to ride up the mountain you just take the one and only road leading up to the eyrie and keep that and there definitely wont be any problems pillaging the vale because if you are besieging the road to the eyrie youve of course already defeated the army of the vale the eyrie holds very few soliders so thats irrelevant to the initial conquest the only reason you want to make the eyrie surrender is to get the lord and get a definitive endthe reason the eyrie is impregnable is not at all that soldiers are tired when they get up there we are directly told why its impregnable and thats because you are subjected to attack in places where you cant attack yourself plus that theres no room to fight you cant take any castle if you cant get lots of to attack it at the same time why do you think the bloody gate has never been taken nothing says that people get tired by getting there the soldiers could sit and rest 400 meters away until they are perfectly rested if they so wished the one and only reason is that the road leading to the gate is too narrow to make a real attack if the road is narrow it doesnt matter how big the conquering army is if your argument about the eyrie was true the bloody gate wouldnt be nearly as strong in peoples mouths please explain why the bloody gate hasnt been run down if it takes a days mountain march to make things impregnable the defensive idea behind the eyrie and behind the bloody gate is exactly the same and the book does plenty to show us that with how people talk about them we also are told that to besiege a castle you need to surround it which is extremely evident in how jaime had to separate his men in order to try to take riverrunand another reason why its ridiculous that the placement of the eyrie is necessary to make it impregnable through tiring out the conquering force is that storms end even without the might of the stormlands couldnt be taken by the mightiest single army in westeros after almost a years siege and thats very accessible on a plain and the lords could sit calmly and feast within sight of the walls the most comfortable siege ever but they still had to resort to trying to starve them out for many months because strong walls is apparently all you need if you need the position of the eyrie how come storms end didnt fallas for the vanity part i dont get how you can think that the vanity part had to do with how big the castle was no one is like to fit their castle with more luxury than casterly rock anyway because no one has the money to match the lannisters and nothing will be bigger than harrenhal and since winterfell was the largest before that it should tell us that size werent seen as that prestigious as the other high lords have more resources the eyrie is aweinspiring because its built on a place where its pretty much impossible to build a castle thus a building feat of marvel its a castle thats basically at the top of the world with a view that leaves everything else far behindfor the last part i dont think winterfell is very well made for defense they have a forrest much too close to the walls plus that its so big despite that theres less people that you cant man the walls everywhere as strong as you could one of the fortresses of the south unless youve managed to get a lot of reinforcements from the banners inside the walls the lannisters didnt build casterly rock either edited

"Zezibesh",2011-05-19,"from how i see it the eyrie was mainly meant to keep the ruling family of the vale alive if anyone ever got through the bloody gate and im sure the eyrie could house a small amount of people for a very long time with sufficient supplies although not in winter"
"Tywin's bastard",2011-05-19,"just because its easy to map out doesnt mean you cant set an ambush up on it infact that makes it easier a single road is only a single jugular and that means it would be constantly harassed from all sides to maintain that amount of supplies you would have to have a constant flow of resources and everytime you sent out men to scare the clans off another clan would attack further up the road and i answered the questions you posed but you did not answer mine if their homeland was being invaded that is gotten past the bloody gate why wouldnt the vale lords recruit the clans who they knew could harass the road it doesnt make sense to say a foreign lord would instantly think to recruit them while the men whove known their capabilities since first settling there wouldnt and if you even glance at the descriptions of the clansmen its obvious that they wouldnt bide their time  they would attack anything that was bountifulits a days muleride to the eyrie you can either have an entire army stretched along a craggy unsure cliff path that requires mules to properly navigate or have them concentrated at any point of which they would have to ride down the mountain to get supplies and the idea of having to make your men most of them unfit peasantry rest a dozen or so times a day to get up to the eyrie is ludicrous what if theyre defeated then you have to do it again and yes thats the reason it is impossible to assault it but as i recall you did not ask about that you asked how the distance was a defensive feature i answered a days march is completely different in both logistical terms the actual movement of men and tactical terms their exhaustion upon arrival stone to snow is forest perfect terrain for harassment and the easiest part of the journey woe another castle the one that has been chucking arrows at you since you started trekking towards it snow to sky is steeper and apparently a good place to rest  your idea of simply resting along the way completely forgets that its not a pleasant road its not easy to stop and rest in comfort and its narrow so its quite easy for a few archers to constantly be popping off arrows at you in short all the benefits of having the high ground constantly ala fighting up a mountain the fact that they were wellbuilt fortifications shows exactly the kind of builders the vale lords were they saw a mountain noted that if anyone breached the bloody gate it would require something even greater to stop them and a mountain like the giants lance fits the bill perfectly tell me do you ever hear about mountain fortresses being regarded as being easy to take regardless of their fortifications the eagles nest gawilghur innsbruck castle no a mountain as small as gawilghur provides massive advantages to a defending force and im not saying a mountain is the key component in making a fortress invulnerable ive never stateed that im saying that it is a massive tactical and strategic advantage that would justify building it in such difficult conditions the idea of it being constructed for vanity does not and the army of the reach was led by mace tyrell and i do not believe your assessment of mightiest single army is correct see the battle of the trident no offence to any lovers of the tyrell family but any army led by mace is unlikely to assault storms end either way there was no way a castle like storms end could be built in the eyrie  it was supposedly aided by bran the builder  its a seaside fortress its hard to take for similar but not identical reasons to a mountain it can be supplied from the sea unless blockaded and restricts movement a mountain restricts movement and imposes harsh conditions upon its attackers saying storms end is impenetrable and it hasnt got a mountain just doesnt work the eyrie hasnt got fortyfootthick wallsand youre saying that small castles with very little decoration are symbols of vanity simply because they cannot be any flashier or bigger than the other castles infact that supports my argument if they couldnt outshine harrenhall or casterly rock why try why not make it the most impenetrable fortress and winterfell is described first and foremost as a castle its encircled by two massive granite walls with a moat inbetween and its built smackdap in the middle of the north a region generally considered damned unruly it may not be impenetrable but it has defence in mind certainlyi see no reason why the clans would be stupid enough to attack big forces that are well trained and well equipped remember that theyve never even seen a proper army which is why their jaws drop when they see tywins host even though its only part the whole lannister host theres a reason why the knights of the vale say that they melt away when they ride out to deal with them its because when the clans face the organized knights they die like flies because they dont have proper weapons and no armor think then what would happen if an entire army marched on the vale the clans obviously mainly stick to attacking easier targets like cats following theyd probably try to attack the smaller military convoys but nothing in the books indicates that they would have any success since the convoys probably wouldnt be very small through hostile territory the whole point of that tyrion manages to strike a deal with them is because they have no chance to contend with vale soldiers without real equipmentif a conquering army has breached the bloody gate thats the real problem of the vale not the eyrie its too late for the vale to think about the mountain men the superior army which it will be if it breaks the gate holds the road to the clans plus that the clans are either already driven off by superior force or have joined the conquering army and even if they could reach them they certainly cant arm them which would be necessary for the clans to be effective but still we always come back to that the mountain clans absolutely hate the vale and would never bow to them in any wayyouve not read what ive written ive said multiple times that you dont bother with the road up to the eyrie you take the base of the mountain so they are cut off and then you demand surrender or burn everything in the vale after youve taken what you need its their choice and itll be exactly like the siege of storms end apart from that its basically impossible to smuggle anything to the eyrie so they would have fallen where stannis didnt if youve taken the base camp youll have already beaten the strength of the vale as they will have already stood in the way apart from those that run back behind their walls to cower and the eyrie itself holds no relevant number of soldiers so basically the vale has probably all but fallen when its time to deal with the eyrie the same goes if the eyrie was an hour up the mountain on a scrawny path youd still not attack the keep because theres not enough room to do anything relevant and youll still be just as vulnerable thats basic siege strategy because you need siege engines to even think about conquering a well built castle only a completely retarded commander would send soldiers up that path regardless if its one hour long or tenthey didnt compete with harrenhal thats the newest big keep in westeros save for the ones the targaryens built and i didnt mean that winterfell is worthless from a defensive view it just has a couple of flaws of which one isnt much if theyve gotten some of the banners inside but as said he big reason why the eyrie is impregnable isnt because the road up there is long its because the attackers have no room to mount an even halfhearted attack as you can only get 23 people running up to it at a time at the same time as they are very exposed to attacks themselves boulders and arrows the extreme location makes the keep unique and a beautiful experience to visit it to me the eyrie just screams that grrm made it because it was cool cool is vanity not because he wanted one keep to be more impossible to take than other keeps that obviously couldnt be conquered either either a keep can be conquered or it cant theres no scale this is of course disregarding dragons since the vale has been conquered and the king in the eyrie gave up when aegon came so obviously the eyrie isnt actually completely impregnable"

"Lord Varys",2011-05-16,"really great episode in my mind probably the best of those that have aired until now but the worst first  littlefinger knows about varys and illyrio really was that really necessary now i really feel as much without out balls as conleth hill looked like when littlefinger told him he knew  and i really want to hit aiden gillen every time i see him on the screen i really did not know that this would mean that much to me i think that might have been a mistake as technically the series has now to elaborate on this more and we should get a reason why littlefinger is not going to sell varys to robertcerseityriontywin later on my explanation in the series really was that he did not know getting rid of varys during the war of the five kings would have been a great asset for littlefinger as it would have greatly weakened the efficiency of the lannister administration besides that i liked really everything although id have preferred the original dialogue between littlefinger and renly during the tourney scene ned and the audience could have gotten there the proof that littlefinger lied about the dagger the loras and renly scene felt awkward and renly seemed a little bit to unsure to me well he should show his weaker side when hes alone with his lover but i really considered renly being at least as ambitious as loras although its very good that they made loras the guy who convinced him to declare himself king renly would not have decided out of the blue to usurp stannis and his two nephews him being an ambitious little plotter makes actually a lot of sense although this differs strongly from the public image of loras as a hottempered young knight renlys decision to crown himself most certainly more macesloras decision as it was renlys it really introduces him as an interesting multilayered character and its also foreshadowing that the creators are most likely very eager to show us the tyrell as the likable plotters they are  its sad that the whole margaery plan is gone but foreshadowing renlys coronation this season is much more important as the audience clearly has to get a feeling about this bearded guy before he suddenly is yet another king the cerseirobertscene was really great i almost expected cersei to talk about rhaegar after robert was done with talking about lyanna thus both could have embraced their loathing for one another  painting the dothraki invasion as real threat was good as well and robert and cersei would have agreed on that topic if not about anything else as it did threaten both robert and cersei and her children"

"panther",2011-05-16,"am i the only one who wasnt impressed with the eyrie sure it looked impressive but i think it was the first time watching this show that i said oh thats obviously cgii was also disappointed with the eyrie but only because it was not at all how i pictured it from the book description in the book it was described as being high on a solid mountain and not necessarily at the top of the mountain from the eyrie one can see the waterfall alyssas tears on giants lance from this i understood that the waterfall started at a greater height than the eyrie and pictured it as a part of a continuous ridgeline with alyssas tears pouring out higher up but reasonably close to the castle the castle is also described as having 7 very slim white towers the great hall was described as long and narrow more rectangular then almost all white with some blue veins in the marble and basically very sterile empty and cold finally it looks out over and has a clear view of the whole vale of arryn below from the first external shot of the eyrie in the series it looks like it has hillsmountains on all sides and not a great plain the eyrie itself looks more eastern like the hagia sophia in istanbul and not shining white winterfell also seems to me to have a more eastern architecture in the series which surprised me the throne room is also round not long and dark not bright cold and sterile i imagined the sky cells to be much smaller which would make them much more threatening in this episode tyrion is put in a huge cell it does not seem like he would need to fear rolling over in his sleep and falling out if he was in the back cornerother than making the sky cells less scary though none of this really matters i agree with others that renly should show a bit more strength and confidence and i didnt really need the lorasrenly scene but i am enjoying the series and thought this a good episode overall"

"Brewmaster",2011-05-16,"23ish pages to read before i commentyikes its like reading through an asoiaf book a few things people need to realize that the pov of the books is a storytelling technique to get us in the heads of characters but that its not necessarily meant to keep us in the dark about things there are things that are meant to be revealed over time jons parentage most likely but there are other things that werent spelled out but were still no less plain for example i cant believe we had someone in the first thread complain that we saw varys and illyrio because it was ambiguous in the book that was in no way ambiguous in the book arya just didnt know who they were but we had 500 pages or so of story before hand and only 2 characters had been described as those 2 looked it was meant to be clear who they were to usjust not to arya as for rlg renlylorasgay i must admit that i didnt realize it right away though i did pick up on it sometime in the 2nd or 3rd book and it was basically spelled out for you by feast i can see why many people wouldnt get that one right away i have no problem with the way it was portrayed on the show yes loras is a stickfigure and should probably have some hardness somewhere on his body other than between his legs but really he was supposed to be very skinny and boyish if he didnt have his shirt off he would have been fine i enjoyed the robert cersei scene immensely i dont need my cersei to have no redeeming qualities or moments and even if the marriage is loveless its a relationship of 17 years youd expect some ability to have a civil conversation from time to time the fact that the only thing they can laugh about together is how pathetic and doomed their marriage rings true to me i didnt get the impression that jaime was trying to kill ned but its hard to show that either way on screen as a viewer i just take him at his word when he says to take ned alive i didnt get the feeling that whatever fight ned put up against jaime was meant to be indicative of how things would go if jaime set out to kill him"
"SerArthurHeath",2011-05-16,"the thing is you dont get a reputation that leads to people being too scared to even think about fighting you when you only have one hand unless you are damn good and jaime is really sure he is that good in his own pov he is convinced he can beat anybody even the mountain with his speed and skill tyrion who has seen bronn fight a lot and thinks he could beat the mountain would rather have jaime instead though maybe for other reasons brienne who eases through opponents in affc notes that she nearly lost to jaime when he had been a prisoner out of practice for months not sure how many was unarmoured unshielded and in chains not that ned is bad we havent seen him fight but he does hold the sword of the morning for at least a while but he is a lord he doesnt fight for a living he has duties and children and was a general and canonically not as good a swordsman as his brother anyway jaimes job is to kill people he is an active knight all he does when not guarding is training or fighting in tournaments no matter how good ned was when he was active there is no way in gazillion years he would beat a jaime whose purpose is to be stop people killing the king by killing them first it would be like tyson coming back and legitimately expecting to beat haye or klitscko with no warm up fights and minimal training its romantic but it wouldnt happen more importantly neds ability now to fight is utterly irrelevant but jaimes is and if he isnt seen to be really good at it like at least as good as wonderstark then all the fear of him killing robb brienne looking good by matching him blounts cowardice in facing him off later everyones fear of him and his actual value to house lannister are all going to look really really stupid in the short term of providing an average fight they have made it really hard work to make jaimes future development and plot pay off he is used to sorting out all his troubles with his sword if he cant do that in the eyes of the viewers now then what difference will losing his hand make and how will it elicit his change towards thinking and introspection he defines himself primarily as a fighter and so does every other character this was the shows chance to let the audience do that now hell just look arrogant and deluded as well as a jerk"
"Morrigan",2011-05-16,"im not saying jaimie sucks and ned is the best swordsmen ever but i certainly find it plausible that jaimes prowess is overblown due to peoples tendency for hyperbole and neds prowess is disregarded because ned isnt a braggart i also find it believable that ned could defeat jaime in a fair fight even if only 3 times out of 10 or something i never got the impression from the books that jaime would be able to cut down ned in two seconds without breaking a sweatgood pointas an example illustrating the above i recently defeated a kendo sensei in a tournament he was 5th dan a sensei whos been practicing for close to 20 years or so vs my 5 years of experience with a lot of tournament experience he also won quite a few of them and has a very competitive style in most circumstances he would roflstomp me in less than a minute but not only did i hold my own i actually ended up beating him 21 for those wondering we usually split the participants per grade but this was during a team match and all grades are mixed up in that case this does not mean im better than him he would beat me probably 9 times out of 10 if not more often but that doesnt mean its impossible for me to beat him or that its impossible for me to put up a good fight if i do lose edited by morrigan 16 may 2011  1227 pm"
"valacirca",2011-05-16,"didnt exactly like the episode as much as most of the people here seem to have liked it but one thing that the episode certainly had going for it is that it was the most focused episode thus far no wall scenes no dany scenes it made the episode feel tight and wellpacedsome thoughts what the heck do those behind the show have against barristan selmy hes not in any of the council meetings he gets left off of scenes where he should be in its a nitpick but still something i dont like was initially disappointed that the tourney was so abridged but then realized that they didnt really need to show it all and eventually i decided that condensing it the way they did was all for the better i still cant get myself to warm up to littlefinger too much in terms of delivering the lines the portrayal is good but his expressions are so flat in everything ive seen him in great scenes in general with regards to the catelyn storyline that hilltribe attack seemed to come too much out of the blue though but it was a nice action sequence with tyrion being fucking hardcore i loved the im willing if she is line from the book but it didnt quite fit in so quickly after the fight the way they did included it in this episode i thought the scene with bran was well placed and well done the child actor playing bran is impressing as much maisie is portraying arya not exactly comfortable seeing varys in three consecutive scenes that occur in completely different places and times varys w ned then varys in the dungeon right after that then varys with lf right after that one it messes up the flowtimeline of the episode a bit but i will say that varys was pretty great in both the scenes with ned and lf i also found it odd how lf claims that he saw varys both with ned and in the dungeon what are the odds of that another nitpick i think arya could have easily fit through the gates that were locked in the dungeon just thought id mention that lol during the varyslf scene i found myself thinking that there are too many scenes throughout the show that merely consisted of two characters purely engaging in a dialogue to move the story forward lazy screenwriting imo lol  arya vs castle guard banter and arya being mistaken as a boy 2x that shot of the eyrie after catelyn  co met their escorts was breathtaking although not as daunting and overwhelmingly huge as i pictured it council meeting re killing dany was well played straight up from the book that was a compelling scene if only they hadnt left out ser barristan  unfortunately omitted scene award the part in the book where mya escorted cat up stone snow  sky i really wanted to see that wtf changed scene award lysa and robin in a throne room arguing with catelyn in the presence of well pretty much everyone lysa and cat should have been speaking privately in lysas chambers quite a jarring change from the book but ill be damned if the lunacy of lysa and the oddnessfragility of the child wasnt characterized perfectly excellent view of the vale too from tyrions cell oh and that was definitely a prosthetic boob renly  loras whoa that was too much interesting scene between robert and cersei but i feel like it did well for the show it was a nice insight into their relationship  how they know its fucked up and they can talk frankly about how fucked up it is because they basically dont care or feel for each other then it contrasts that to how hurt robert still is from losing lyanna i thought this scene was well written drama final scene was so much lacking in drama action and tension compared to the book but i suppose it was done well enough damn jaime lannister reading the end of that chapter from the book and even seeing the ending of that episode made me rage so much"
"The Knight of Grasses",2011-05-16,"my first post  ive appreciated the discussion here and would love to add my voice im watching with a couple people  my wife and a friend  who have not read the books i could tell from their reactions what they picked up on and what they didnt which to me is a good gauge of how well theyre creating nuance for the nonreaders  the scene in the eyrie was well done it was immediately obvious that both lysa and robin are messed up  the fight with the mountain clans looked great although i thought catelyn could have done a bit more to hide herself but we missed something in the setup my friend asked who are these guys when they appeared out of nowhere and started attacking i realize there are time constraints but it hurt the scene not to have any clue who the mountain clans were  while i was disappointed not to get more of the tourney the lorasgregorhound scene was great apart from the backandforth between renly and littlefinger which i thought was a bit blatant ive seen a few comments saying that it wasnt obvious how big the mountain was i disagree my friend remarked that he looked huge and asked me if gregor was a total ass i told him that he had no idea  the dragon skull was a bit confusing to nonreaders when we first saw it but then he remembered the exposition from viserys last week and realized what it was it was kind of a neat moment i didnt really care for the viserys bath scene  i thought the time could have been used for other things  but it was necessary it shows that the writers really know what theyre doing my own observations  i have to watch it again because i got lost in the scene with littlefinger and varys at one point i just threw up my hands whos watching who with the what andhuh even knowing whats going on i didnt know what was going on  i really liked the robertcersei scene at face value but i hope it makes sense based on what they do with cerseis motivations  i enjoyed the confrontation between the winterfell men and jaime to end the episode overall probably my favorite episode"
"Maia",2011-05-16,"hm nobody references the big change to cats character at all namely that she doesnt kill a man during the skirmish with the tribesmen in the show heh they are making her a big softie indeed lysa  ick imho it was overdone and implausible she didnt suckle sweet robin in public in the books and i dont see her vassals putting up with her if she did they could have had a brief private scene with her and cat during the next episode and put it there it would have been more believable i really loved the robertcersei scene people keep talking about how cersei was changed from the books but my impression of the agot cersei before her subsequent dumbening down and crazing up was actually very close to what they are showing here and of robert too really  people keep saying that he is a bigger dick in the show  but imho he is exactly like the book robert the scene wonderfully summed up their relationship  as is hinted in agot and then confirmed in affc evil psycho or not cersei was prepared to give him a chance in the beginning he blew it completely never even tried to make up for it and ugliness ensued now a different woman wouldnt have gone to the extremes of preventing common kids though she may very well have taken a lover too and may have tried for longer but thats cersei for you frankly i deplore the extent of deconstruction of cersei in the books  imho she would have been a much better character if she remained at the agot level of competenceevilness throughout and didnt get any stupid prophecies if they go that way in the series id only applaud i am unsure about the tack they took with renlyloras but the scene certainly introduced tyrells as political force to recon with and established that they are also not slouches at intrigue i dont know why they had to sissify renly for it but oh well ditto re beefing up neds fighting prowess  but it is more difficult to show that somebody is a good generalstrategist at the time of peace so whatever on the whole a very enjoyable episode imho"

"Tywin's bastard",2011-05-16,"loved it as usualmy only gripe is apparently one that isnt share by anyone else the fight scenes seem extraordinarily sloppy for some reason these are supposed to be the most bad assed of bad asses and they are wielding their swords like hollywood actors on their first run through the choreography but like i said im apparently the only one i must have an image in my head that isnt accurate at alli thought it worked fine as staged fights always demands that you as a viewer buys into it 100 you cant get actors to look as people with life long experience unless they actually have that look at the matrix where they had the actors study wushu under great trainers for 6 months before the shoot they still didnt look like they were nearly as good as they were supposed to be if you watch with an eye that doesnt try to immerse itself and they still had special effects to help themthen theres also the fact that if a fight always flows smoothly between two or more fighters the entire time thats also unrealistic youll even see the best martial artists in the world have some clumsy exchanges because they happened to attack each other at the same time in a way that just made both attacks fizzleas for your mental image thats of course going to be better because the books can describe the characters exactly how the author wants it while you have the limitations of actors in these kind of productions i do however think you are underestimating how hard it is to make things look good and by extension how bad actors look the first time through the choreography"

"Papa Manderly's Meat Pie",2011-05-16,"more importantly neds ability now to fight is utterly irrelevant but jaimes is and if he isnt seen to be really good at it like at least as good as wonderstark then all the fear of him killing robb brienne looking good by matching him blounts cowardice in facing him off later everyones fear of him and his actual value to house lannister are all going to look really really stupidthat is a good point and i had not thought of it that way they have certainly downplayed jaimes prowess in the series i think they can still demonstrate it with the whispering wood so i dont feel all is lost also for the nonswordfightingconnoisseurs among us like myself i have no idea if that fight scene was an example of good swordsmanship or not it seemed to me like it was two really good swordsman evenlymatched i dont think it necessarily detracted from their ability to portray jaime as an excellent fighter later on"

"Aganerral",2011-05-16,"ned stark crossed blades with the sword of the morning and lived to tell about it or rather lived to say infuriatingly little about it i lold also agree with the general sentiment expressed here my interpretation from the books is that jaime would beat ned in a full fight but i never got hte feeling that ned wouldnt be able to hold his own for a whileother random comments about the episodelike the added cerseirobert scene after reading all the books my thought about cersei and roberts marriage is that she wasnt thrilled about it but was willing to give it a chanceuntil robert showed no interest in her by being unable to move on from lyanna and hitting anything that moves so i dont mind a couple scenes like this that make her seem more sympatheticalso liked the lfvarys scene  it kind of shows that these two are the real players making the moves and pulling the stringslorasrenly  sort of enh on this one didnt expect hbo to be as subtle about it as the books but that was pretty blatant smilegif classbbcemoticon alt  im not overly put out that they looked a little soft it drives home the point that they are knights of summer that have never really been tested so next episode would be the tower of joy dream unless they go light on kl scenes next time which is possible given what else needs to be covered will be interesting to see how they handle that in light of the theories that it feeds in to i do wonder if they might skip it altogether they havent been big on showing dreams and flashbacks at all"

"Dihm",2011-05-16,"couple of thoughts the tournament was underwhelming it went off much better this episode than last but they completely failed to give it any sort of context we only saw 3 people total riding and didnt hear about a single other pairing there was no real conclusion to it either since the hound was never mentioned as even being a part of it and loras withdrawing would have loved to see them mention that it was the semifinals and have them show the sandorjaime especially for robert to be able to mock him before the gregorloras match followed by loras conceding to sandor instead of the weird hand raise for the crowd deal the sandorgregor fight was fun but seemed really slow like bad stereotype about knights using 20 pound swords and not being able to move in armor slow really enjoyed the lyssarobin scene i was sure they wouldnt show the suckling but was unpleasantly surprised i always pictured lyssa more like queen mary from the movie elizabeth though"

"stevelabny",2011-05-16,"well thats your interpretation which incidentally according to the creators of the show is totally wrong the wolf and the lion behind the scenesoh you mean like when grrm said that ned was the main character of the story behind the scenes snippets often dont contain the full truth due to the nature of spoilers the showrunners cant bash ned too hard because they have to make him a convincing plot element and a second point that is probably going to open up a whole nother can of worms that i dont even want to get intolistening to a creators viewpoint on their work is almost never a good idea as odd as it sounds the creator is often an unreliable narrator when talking about their work outside of the work itself this is why millions of internet hours have been taken up defining canon as only what happens in the books and whether or not authorial intent should be factored init shouldntif grrm himself would do an interview and talk about a scene that isnt in the books it wouldnt be canon whether it was something ridiculous like a nedcersei one night stand or something perfectly believable like some new atrocity by gregor clegane the same is true for dd and the showcanon theyre building their interviews are meaningless and should not be seen as canon although that doesnt mean its not interestingas a further example loras and renly would be gay in canon whether george answered the question or not because its there in the book harry potters dumbledore being gay is not canon because it simply isnt in the books and jk rowlings interviews are no more canon than fanfiction final example han shot first"

"Smiler",2011-05-16,"great episode my favorite since the kingsroad episode my concern of a lack of epicness from the way the tournament was handled were somewhat laid to rest with the handling of the mountain clan battle i thought it looked real and was grizzly as hell there is hope for whispering wood and the greenfork sure i wish the tournament would have been grander but i wont dwell on it this episode had just the right amount of actual quotes from the books most people have already laid out the pros and cons fairly well but ill comment on the 2 most controversial cerseirobert scene i liked this scene a lot i guess agot is still pretty fresh in my mind since im in the middle of a reread currently halfway through clash the two complaints i hear a lot are that cersei is not as coldhearted and bitchy as she is in the books and she isnt as sexy and sluttly as the books portray her either i agree with maia that the cersei that were seeing on screen at the moment is very consistent with the agot cersei we really dont get to see cerseis scheming direct bitchiness in agot with the exception of ladys death until her meeting with ned in the godswood and then later when she tears up the kings final orders in the throne room other than that we get disgusted looks and her occasional pissiness to robert as far as her permiscuity we dont hear any rumors of that until acok i thought the scene worked well and wasnt a departure in character cersei tells ned in the godswood that she did think that she could grow to love robert until the night of their wedding when he said lyanna in bed maybe the tv cersei held on a little longer but not by much and i dont think its out of character to have a conversation about it like they did i also liked that the scene showed the other side of robert and the main reason why he has turned out to be a drinking womanizer and lousy king you can see that he believes things would have been different he could have been a better man if he only had lyanna we dont know if he would have lyanna doesnt seem to think he would change his womanizing ways according to her conversation with ned but its nice to see that side of robert renlyloras i think loras looks fine the book describes him as slinder somewhat effeminate i like how the scene established a more solid foundation for why renley would declare over his brother it does kind of rule out trying to bring margaery to robert but i dont think that its overly important ill reserve judgment if renly is too much of a wimp ill see how he plays to the crowd if his outside confidence is how it is in the books i dont have an issue with him being a little wimpier in the bedroom since we never see how he is with loras when theyre alone going by how he acts in the council meetings i think he will be fine edit  looking at titles is episode 7 going to be when ned gets beheaded arent they taking a big risk by letting this episode get watched in advance a week early by the hbo go or whatever it is called subscribers edited by smiler 16 may 2011  0118 pm"

"Ran",2011-05-16,"stevelabny they dont need to bash them no but they also dont need to build him up its very obvious that the shows ned stark is intended to be jaimes equal or nearequal and who says ned isnt the main character of the story his character completely dominates agot it all depends on what the story means  thats obfuscation not misrepresentation which is what you seem to feel the producers are really doing when they talk about neds prowess"

"Abaddon",2011-05-16,"as an example illustrating the above i recently defeated a kendo sensei in a tournament he was 5th dan a sensei whos been practicing for close to 20 years or so vs my 5 years of experience with a lot of tournament experience he also won quite a few of them and has a very competitive style in most circumstances he would roflstomp me in less than a minute but not only did i hold my own i actually ended up beating him 21  this does not mean im better than him he would beat me probably 9 times out of 10 if not more often but that doesnt mean its impossible for me to beat him or that its impossible for me to put up a good fight if i do losefirst of all congratulations smilegif classbbcemoticon alt second great point and in addition its worth mentioning that ned is fighting for his life and the lives of his men desperation can make you reckless but it can also drive you to heights of performance you cant normally reach i really got the sense that ned was fighting for his life desperately and jaime was not and was enjoying it far more ned seemed pushed to his limit jaime did not to mei think its fair to say that the ned of the series is a better swordsman than the ned of the books but i dont think its nearly as egregious a difference as it has been portrayed by some and i definitely got the impression that jaime was still better if not earthshatteringly so"
"legba11",2011-05-16,"i dont understand the complaints about tvloras body type as somebody mentioned towards the end of the first thread hes described as slender as a reed if this actor doesnt have the body type you picturedwell thats fine but you werent picturing loras as he was actually described in the bookshe would need some sort of muscle to be a knight he has to fight while wearing 50 lbs of armor and he is quite good at it we dont expect him to be a hulk not at all but he would need muscles to do what he does he is built like a middleschool boy"

"Cereal Forel",2011-05-16,"i think there are some unreasonably high expectations here these are actors not trained sword fighters buster reeves mentions that he got maybe a week to work with kit harrington and even less with some of the lesser role actors the fights are also being designed to appeal to people who have very little knowledge of real sword fighting and have been raised instead with unrealistic hollywood martial artsi dont care why it isnt convincing just that it isnt im also not looking for flourishes and whatnot i just want their swings to have some weight behind them know what i mean luckily this series isnt dependent on good fight scenes so as long as the syrio forel exit scene and the red viper  mountain show down are sufficiently epic ill be content smilegif classbbcemoticon alt "

"Jaime L",2011-05-16,"the eyrie was not at all how i pictured it but its easy to see why they did it that way they didnt have the time to devote to climbing for a night and they wanted to convey just how out in the open it was they definitely did well with the sky cells the scene with lysa was about as well done as it could have been given their lack of time to build any kind of relationship between catelyn and her sister it was plain that both cat and tyrion knew that lysa had gone crazyyeah really thought the view from the sky cells and the great hall made it all come together  the former provided the sense of openness and sheer altitude the latter with its grand and cold white blue veined marble and the coolness of the sunlight that filters in through it the high altitude off kilter feel enhanced by lysas sheer creepocity felt a little shiningesque imo"
"Arya The Assassin",2011-05-16,"things that i likedthe eyrie loved the design and the sky cells the shot were tyrion peeks over the edge of his cell was great in the book it took much longer to reach the top and you had the feeling that it was a very perilous ascent but for quite understandable reasons they simply couldnt spend that much screentime on this part of their journey i also liked the rendering of the eyrie in the opening title sequencethe mountain vs the hound the fight was cool  as long as it lasted i think the fight shouldve lasted a bit longer though it felt rushed and lost some of its impactarya im not a boythe hilltribe fight nice actionsequence showcasing bronns skills with the blade which will come in handy later tyrion im willing if she is lol straight from the bookthe first dialogue scene with barristan and ned i like the barristan character and it also shows why sean bean is one of the best actors in the series he seemed genuinely annoyedthe scene with bran and maester luwin i think isaacs performance in this scene is very goodthe swordfight between ned and jamie they deviated a bit from the book here but i dont really mind in the book jamie simply rides away letting his men take care of ned and his soldiers in the tv series its been suggested several times that ned is a very skilled swordsman so when ned and jamie confronted each other i expected it to be an even fight and it was until one of the soldiers interferred i suppose the writers chose to deal with the scene in this way to make things more dramatic because in the book theres no duel between ned and jamie and ned injures himself when he falls under his horsethings that i was less excited aboutthe scene with cersei and robert i had the impression that their relationship was much colder i also felt that the scene was too longthe scene with loras and renly i actually think a more subtle approach wouldve worked better here and frankly speaking i didnt feel that gethins renly performance was particularly impressive i didnt really have a problem with loras slender frame though because hes supposed to look that way and it doesnt necessarily contradict the fact that hes supposed to be a skilled knight and jousterthe lorasrenly scene has been the subject of some debate were they gay or not heres an article about gay characters in gotgays go medieval in upcoming a game of thrones fantasy seriesquoterenly is gay in the books too says george rr martin the author of the bestselling novels but online chatter suggests that not every reader picked that fact up i never meant to make it a mystery martin says i like to handle things subtly i couldnt ever actually say suchandsuch is gay because as im sure you know the word wasnt invented until the 60s and im talking medieval times and im not going to say soandso is gay but i thought it was pretty clear in context i do have lesbian characters in the books and bisexual characters too he adds the red viper of dorne in book three is bisexual i try to reflect a whole spectrum of humanity as best i can  one of the luxuries of a show like this one of the upsides to it is you can really get a chance to dig in deep to the characters and explore who they and what makes them and why theyre doing the things theyre doing weiss says we had two great actors finn jones and gethin anthony who play loras tyrell and renly baratheon their being gay is an integral part of who they are their relationship to each other weiss gives credit to hbo for being allowed to explore the characters sexuality one of the great things about that channel is that they give you the freedom to show full people and sexuality is an integral part of who they are its really important to present their sexuality openly and honestly even if they arent able to in the fictional fantasy world in which they live"

"The King's Foot",2011-05-16,"loved the episode  best so far some seriously gaspworthy moments  gregor decapping the horse  the hound taking a knee right as gregors sword flies over his head  those two moments almost back to back were sheer awesomeness  the revelation of the eyrie  both in the opening credits and in the sceneother things i loved  the looks exchanged between cat and tyrion in the eyrie throne room absolutely brilliant acting the what the eff is going on here vibe was so real and the brief glance between the two was perfect  the robertcersei and varyslf scenes yes theyre not in the book but they were enormously important to building up those characters in ways we cant get on screen from the inner monologuesobservations of the pov chars in the books example though rb is a drunken lout in the books theres enough memoryinner monologue from ned that we know he was a legendary warrior in his youth and someone worthy of great respect and consideration we cant get that on screen unless there are scenes with robert acting serious and real this scene also lets you see he isnt blithely ordering the hit on dany because he hates all targs since rhaegar stole his twu wuv  he has considered the military problem of the dothraki and concluded hes fcked if they come across the narrow sea same beat on cersei  she has added depth now that will make her all the more despicable when she offs rb and reveals she abortedkilled his trueborn son cersei in the show is different from cersei in the books right now and this episode was the first one where i started liking the changes  the fact that loras looks like he should be in a boy band i would have pictured him more muscular but thats my only complaint i always thought of a buff platewearing justin timberlake this loras works fine for me like he wandered over to the set from the disney channel where he just wrapped a guest spot on hannah montana or somethingthings i wasnt wild about but will learn to deal with  overall the tourney was a disappointment in terms of the scale and grandeur of it the payoff with gregorsandor was great but i never came close to seeing the enormous extravagance of the tourney which is supposed to represent some of the gildedage quality of roberts reign wereindebtuptooureyeballsbutscrewit decadence this looked like rb took neds advice and scaled the whole thing down oh well  not enough explanation of the hill clans maybe well get that on tyrions exodus but for this episode it was confusing as to who was attacking and why  ned getting stabbed in the leg not breaking his leg under his falling horse i guess they wanted the ambush to happen right os the brothel so ned wasnt mounted yet but i loved how this scene played in the books and merely liked it here i guess this is just one of those scenes i wished they had taken straight out of the books no changes whatsoever bc its so perfect  theons scene alright i get it the man is keeping the kraken down being a ward sucks no one takes you seriously no really i got it  renlys portrayal no not the gay part hes roberts brother he reads in the books like someone who is very martial and strong but just doesnt take all that war stuff too seriously here hes a dandy fop who looks like he could barely lift a longsword no pun intended i think he just needs to be a little tougher  no jeyne poole at least not w sansa at the tourney ifwhen we get to season 4 well need a jeyne poole to come back out of the woodwork and pretend to be arya presumably after being plowed like a field in one of lfs brothels for a year or soim really fascinated by next week as injured ned should start having recollections of toj right ive been wondering all season how theyre going to get us the historical backstory on rlj and the robellion should be interesting maybe they should go loststyle and starting featuring a relevant flashback at the opening of each episode"

"QueenOfThorns",2011-05-16,"my initial gut reaction to any scene that is not in the books is yuck however i did like the cerseirobert scene after my initial reaction subsided mostly i can just understand why it was done i mean robert dies not even 23 into agot and in an season with only 10 episodes we dont have much time left with the lovable lout nonreaders need to learn more about his character and the cerseirobert dynamic either way this scene was particularly superbly acted"
"Arya The Assassin",2011-05-16,"this scene also lets you see he isnt blithely ordering the hit on dany because he hates all targs since rhaegar stole his twu wuv  he has considered the military problem of the dothraki and concluded hes fcked if they come across the narrow seai think grrm also showed a different more humane side of him in the book after robert had been mortally wounded robert then said that he didnt want dany to die because she was only a child just like ned had told him he believed it was the gods whod sent the boar to kill him as a punishment he might also have said this simply to make peace with ned of course but it felt more like he was speaking from the heart so to speakmy impression is that roberts judgment is often clouded by his constant drinking but when hes dry he makes a lot more sense i also feel that a lot of his loud talk and brash boisterous behaviour not only has something to do with his alcohol problems but that its also a kind of facade not enough explanation of the hill clans maybe well get that on tyrions exodus but for this episode it was confusing as to who was attacking and whyi felt that the explanation they gave in the tv episode was sufficient tyrion made it clear that the hill tribes or shadowcats would kill him if he tried to escape soon after they were attacked i dont feel its that important to know why they were attacked because i think its logical to assume that the hill tribes wanted to killget rid of them and steal their stuff"

"Sword in the Morning",2011-05-16,"what to say what to say this was hands down my favorite episode thus far i can see where the deviations from the book might irk some viewers but really the whole presentation was dragging out oohs ahs and gasps from me the whole time thoughts renly him being gay with loras is fine but the way they presented the scene really changed his character i also feel like a blatant manscapingblowjob combo wasnt entirely necessarythe connection was there in the books but you had to follow the breadcrumb trail it was something that the more observant readers teased out of the woodwork and was later confirmed by grrm it wasnt a scene that was called for due to it being confined to characters thought process in the books and i think the writers were trying to get an omgwtfbbq response out of the viewers it worked but at the cost of finesse they shoved a lot of lysas crazy into one scene they definitely got the point across im not decided on whether i feel thats good or badbut i loveloveloved the reaction shots between catelyn and tyrion i love the fight choreography in the show they do an utterly fantastic jobavoiding the swashbuckling swordplay of most high fantasy in favor of realismactual knights used their entire bodies in combat they didnt just clash blades over and over they would beat one another with the pommel grapple kick anything it took to defeat the opponent the choreography here is less flashy and more rough and tumble and brutal and i love it the tourney was underwhelming nuff said honestly i like most of the added scenes i feel like a lot of the complaints floating around this site are for some reason what why arent the characters more onedimensional no what i loved about the book series is the vast allencompassing gray areas whether you agree with the character or not grrm provides a reasonable framework for their actions whether its greed or lust or vengeance or pride theyre trying to make cersei a villain into someone you cant just hate unreservedly because shes still a person we dont allow any saurons in this show dammit loved the episode they really cranked up the intensity this week"
"Arya The Assassin",2011-05-16,"i wonder if the changes to the scene daylight no rain and no horse falling on ned were budgetary and not wanting to risk a horse falling on sean bean honestly i expected them to change neds injury even before i saw the scene play outi believe it was for dramatic purposes but thats just speculation on my part i think it looks better from a tv series standpoint to have ned and jamie fight each other than having jamie simply ride away it wouldnt have been that difficult or dangerous to make it look like the horse fell on sean with a bit of smart editing so i dont think that was the problem here"

"Jojen",2011-05-16,"wow there really seems to be a real mix of opinions on this ep i thought it was soso some good scenes some bad scenes some that went on for too long and some that were too short rl was just long enough thank you i do hope that the margaery plotline shows up in later eps or in season 2 im not crazy about loras being such a schemer although maybe he learned it from his grandmotherin my first viewing i didnt like the scene between varys and littlefinger it just didnt work for me it was like they were talking at each other not with each other upon second viewing i realize thats more or less the point its a pissing contest not a conversation the best part imo was how varys gets the last work in the end of the scene as hes walking out of the room disturbing news from far away havent you hearda line that didnt work at all for me was lfs comment to renly about having his friend its not a line that i think the book lf would have tossed out there in public like that if hes trying to prove that hes got something on renly he should keep it a bit closer to the vest instead of practically blurting out renlysinclinations in front of everybodyi liked the fight scene between the hound and the mountain the hackandslash swordplay worked well there i thought they had robert break it up too quickly though given how hed recently announced to ned how eager he was to see someone fight if he couldnt do it himselfas other posters have stated i agree that the fight between ned and jaime could have been choreographed better but to me it looked like jaime was just toying with him i did like jaimes reaction to when the fight was unexpectedly cut short whether it was necessary or not it showed that he has an honorable side to him and isnt the sort to resort to cheap tricks in fair fight this makes him slightly more sympathetic that he might be at this point in the booksimo cersei remains as unsympathetic to me as she is in the books even after her scene with robert which i enjoyed but am not sure it was necessary but thats mainly because the shows version is way too reserved and too much the poor victim dont know if its headeys acting or just the way the characters been written but she just seems awfully bland to me whenever i see her i just want to fastforward to season 2mark addys scenes i want to slow down pause and play over and over again especially whenever he insults lancel roberts conversation with cersei made me wonder just how different a king would robert have turned out if hed married lyanna after all edited by jojen 16 may 2011  0606 pm"
"stevelabny",2011-05-16,"yeah check around 345 that would be after they state that lysas behaviour is because she thinks the murderers of her huband are brought to her house and after they state that varys is at any point just doing what is best for the kingdom as he tries to convince ned and tyrion its not like lysa killed her husband herself and varys is at this point partial to viserys ascention to the throne no matter what ned doesthank you that probably would have better a better point for me to make that opening the canontangent well we dont know what role theyre going to give lysa but in that theyre deliberately not giving away a central mystery of the first book are you seriously equating that with talking about how good a fighter ned isi cant speak for durararaftw but yes i would seriously equate them my original point was that you cant always take what dd say as fact because they will be guarding against spoilers and hyping up plotpoints when you see that theyre not being honest in their comments abut lysa and that at best theyre embellishing varys role then why wouldnt the same apply to ned"
"Tywin's bastard",2011-05-16,"i believe it was for dramatic purposes but thats just speculation on my part i think it looks better from a tv series standpoint to have ned and jamie fight each other than having jamie simply ride away it wouldnt have been that difficult or dangerous to make it look like the horse fell on sean with a bit of smart editing so i dont think that was the problem hereyes im very sure they did it for dramatic purposes they have been building up this rivalry between ned and jaime and it would be really annoying for the audience to get an anticlimax where they dont square off and then never see each other againi doubt the book version would have looked that great on tv either it worked pretty well when it was written but a horse slipping and falling isnt really a very dramatic sight"

"Cable",2011-05-16,"and robert and cersei went on unbelievably long i actually went to the bathroom during iti thought that scene was definitely the best of the series i could stand to watch that scene a few more timeseveryones mileage varies i guess edited by cable 16 may 2011  0711 pm"
"SFA-OK",2011-05-16,"first time post as a fan of the books ive felt the shows have been soso up to this point i thought episode 5 was definitely the best one yet and its the only one up to this point that i think im going to watch again i have a few problems with how theyre going about adapting the first book   the pacing seems to be way too fast compared to the book someone mentioned lack of subtly im not sure if that is it as the book is pretty graphic i think its more of a lack of characterization and depth i had no idea there is going to only be 8 episodes in the 1st season until i saw the list on here that just isnt enough episodes to do all the characters justice imo i think 12 episodes wouldve been way better and would allow for more characterization i guess hbo didnt want to gamble on more episodes in the first season hopefully the 2nd season will have more episodes  the friction between ned and jaime seems to be overdone compared to the book the book has enough drama no need to go over the top imo the scene where jaime confronts ned in winterfell at the feast was ridiculous imo maybe im mistaken but i thought jaime was barely even in the first book it wouldve been cool if he was used less in the 1st season  the scene in episode 5 between cersei and robert was great but there has hardly been any scenes with that depth of dialogue in the show so far  when adapting a book to screen the key imo is to make things standout shots characterization pacing and i havent really seen that so far with this show its been sort of an overly safe middle of the road take so far quick shots short dialogue etc  also not a fan of how the show is handling cersei and theon theon seems to be a much bigger douche than he was in the book maybe im wrong but i dont remember him being such a dick in the 1st book the scene with cersei and robert was great but it makes it harder to picture cersei doing the things she does later in the books i think it wouldve been cool if they followed certain characters for longer than just a few minutes sort of like how each chapter in the books is devoted to one character it would allow for better characterization and depth but i guess with just 8 episodes covering 800 pages of material its pretty much impossible to do that"

"Xxtayce",2011-05-16,"okay overall opinion on the episode ehmy least favorite honestlyrobert  ceresii actually really enjoyed the scene with robert and ceresi it makes it seem like her actions later are due to a more humane reason in the books she hated robert took him for his crown aborted the only kid he ever got on her and has been screwing jamie practically since she was born robert was nothing more than an obstacle to her  one that she hated even more when he called out lynnas name on their wedding night at least that was my take on it the series gives her a real reason and some depth she tried to be good but it was forced out of her by how robert treated her so she gave all her caring to her children i like this version of her more even though i think shes pure evilarya dragon skullsthe dragon skulls were disappointing sadly so and even though i just reread the book last week i still didnt catch that it was ilyrio and varys talking until i saw it that part was interestinglyssa  robertthe eyrie didnt look how i imagined it would nor did lyssa but she was absolutely insane chillingly so that was perfect i would have preferred seeing robert weaker sicklier darker circles under his eyes that sort of thing he has epilepsy from what i gathered id think his mothers overprotective tendencies wouldve made him look worse loras  renlyill be brief here since theres a whole thread on this now overdone and unnecessary out of the two id figure loras to be the woman in the relationship not renly i think the sexual part of this scene was about as long as the bathtub scene and just as ridiculous the entire series would be better if both of those scenes were about 10 minutes shorterned  jamieawesome but not the best cliffhanger style ending wouldve been better to show ned passing out from blood loss and jamies face fading out of his vision as he passes out with jamie threatening for his brother back that would have been chilling this was more of a wtf thats it kind of ending and to come after the episode that ends with tyrion and the swords sigh too much to live up to i guessedit the previous font i had was retardedly ugly edited by xxtayce 16 may 2011  0838 pm"

"evanesco75",2011-05-17,"valmy i love your avatar thumbsupgif classbbcemoticon altthumbsup  this was my favourite episode thus far much to love hardly any nitpicking well except for renly being such a reluctant claimant and a general wuss the jaimened fight was brilliant as was the hound vs the mountain i for one am loving rory mccanns take on sandor hes formidable indeed i also loved tyrion as ever pd is becoming better with each episode i confess to having him at the top of my fave list and though i always liked tyrion in the books pd is making him even more likeable for me same case with kh jon is my least favourite yet i found myself appreciating his scenes last week despite the heavyhandedness i also enjoyed varys and lf varys owned the scene imo excellent mix of disdain and sarcasm there lysa and sweetrobincreepiness shudder as squicky and sad as in the books sky cellswin just what id imagined the hubbys in a tizzy right now fretting over ned sigh he keeps asking how long will it take ned to heal will he be missing in the next episode i cant very well tell him hell be missing from the show altogether soon can i worriedgif classbbcemoticon altworried  oh yes cersei and robert was a perfect scene well written and acted and very authentic almost like a missing moment really i love the way the showrunners are able to capture the tonality of the books so well in new scenes shows theyre invested cersei gave robert one last chance and he botched it you can see headeys expression go from vulnerable to steely right there wonderful stuff i liked lorass casting overall i liked the manipulative side to him shades of olenna and the scene between him and renly was very well done overall barring renlys whining i always found him confident and well adjusted in the books i like how theyre sowing the seeds for s2 and clash with theon and now renly"

"theMountainGoat",2011-05-17,"the first half of the episode was great second half felt like the worst part of the season so far to me slow paced and full of scenes we could have done without or could have been a whole lot shorter allowing more time for better things like showing more of the pageantry of the tourney for example the cerseirobert scene was like fingers scratching slowly down a blackboard in my mind i loathed and detested every fucking second of it the very idea that these two characters who hate and despise each other would sit down and have an honest deep calm rational human and adult conversation about the truth of their marriage just reeked of total bullshit to me thats not merely a book verses tv opinion it is clear from previous scenes and presumably future scenes too from every episode of the tv show itself that these characters would never be capable of having that conversation they argue heatedly they fight theres physical abuse she aborts and kills his children some have suggested that it would not be impossible for them to have done this at some point in their 17 year history but i categorically disagree with that opinion it is out of character for them in the context of the tv show as well as the book near the beginning of this episode robert is saying how cersei was forced on him by jon arryn and as we know cersei is plotting to have robert killed it just does not make logical sense for them to sit down and have a heart to heart about how much they hate each other they might has well have hugged it out afterward because that would not have been any more out of character than what was said yes the scene was well acted and i can appreciate some people loved it but it totally utterly and completely failed for me it is a similar story with the lfvarys scene yes seeing these two characters together is great having them reveal far too much about who saw what and who knows what was just wrong and out of character for two master manipulators yes its tv and you have to hit the viewer over the head with this stuff to get them to understand whats going on but this is another example of saying too much making your motives too clear to your enemies they did the same with cerseined last week surely the only logical conclusion that varys or littlefinger could draw from their pissing contest is that they should kill the other asap having these opinions of the other is one thing but to actually voice them and make direct accusations and reveal your hand like that no no no im also starting to see the complaints about renly having loras plant the idea that he should be king just felt oh so wrong to me book renly would know that he ought to be king because he is simply the best man for the job no questions no doubts tv renly needs to be lead to that conclusion because he does not have the charisma and arrogance he should have this isnt an actors performance issue clearly a change of direction by the writers in this context it will actually feel out of character for renly to suggest to eddard that they gather their swords and strike now while robert is on his deathbed before it is too late tv renly doesnt seem savvy enough to grasp something like that or are they going to have loras point this out to him too but there was some great stuff that i enjoyed gregor decapitating his horse  really did not think they would go there or that it would be as graphic as it was major props for pulling that off so convincingly the sky cell was totally awesome tyrion looking down was perfect just a pity the establishing shot of the eyrie when they were riding up to it before did not match it the castle was clearly not high enough up to be a mountain from where you can look down and see clouds beneath you it barely qualified as a tall hill really good to see the change to the opening titles to include the eyrie but since the wall and vaes dothrak were not in this episode it would have made far more sense to instead have the crossroads inn pop up and show the road east to the eyrie would have done a lot to help nonbookwalkers who have not looked at the hbo online guide to appreciate the geography of the area loved the scene where bran was talking about his mother being away from home loved the mountain clan attack on catelyn and tyrion bronn kicked ass great performance by jerome flynn lysa and robin were definitely creepy definitely a good choice to make that our first impression of those characters loved arya hiding inside the dragon skull to avoid being seen another good choice though i think it would have played better to not directly show the two people she overheard would be nice to keep some mystery to the tv show after all tv viewers like that sort of thing as much as book readers ya know i also really liked the final fight at the end of the episode i was shouting for jory during that wishing he would somehow survive this time it was pretty obvious that they were going to change it to have jaime and eddard cross swords and i think it really worked brilliantly here good payoff for all the build up so far yes im ending this post on something they did different to the book that actually worked making it explicitly clear that my opinion is not derived solely from omg they did not do it like the book sacrilege and im going to belabour the point with some extra words added here more pointless filler to really drive this home just like a tv show would stating and reinforcing the same point again and again in a horribly unambiguous attempt at subtlety"

that these are lf and varys best kept secrets maybe these are considered lowhanging fruits that they can use to jab each other with but lf was the first to stumble with his mention of ilyrio obviously not a lowhanging fruit i could totally buy that they were trying to maneuver each other in this scene but i also feel they would in reality be much less talkative to each otherim also starting to see the complaints about renly having loras plant the idea that he should be king just felt oh so wrong to me book renly would know that he ought to be king because he is simply the best man for the job

too late tv renly doesnt seem savvy enough to grasp something like that or are they going to have loras point this out to him tooi dont have a problem with this in the books renly clearly says that ned should act now to secure his regency not so they can remove the lannisters and their incestuous offspring from power in fact it is not very clear that renly knows about the twincest or not i always wondered why renly would so readily act to take the throne for himself over his brother and i find the argument that it was just because he was too arrogant to be a little farfetched i like loras pushing him and i think it makes total sense i dont think this makes renly less politically savvy it just makes him less ready to forsake his older brotherthe sky cell was totally awesome tyrion looking down was perfect just a pity the establishing shot of the eyrie when they were riding up to it before did not match it the castle was clearly not high enough up to be a mountain from where you can look down and see clouds beneath you it barely qualified as a tall hill reallyi actually thought the eyrie looked a little ridiculously overthetop i also felt that way about the books description perhaps it was an issue of depth perception because when i watched i got the impression the castle was still a very long way off and as such was very high up and large for how far away it wasalso i dont know what your definition of hill is but that was anything but a hill even a tall onei also really liked the final fight at the end of the episode i was shouting for jory during that wishing he would somehow survive this time it was pretty obvious that they were going to change it to have jaime and eddard cross swords and i think it really worked brilliantly here good payoff for all the build up so farcount me as another who liked this change i really liked the book scene but i think this plays much better on tv and it has just as much emotional impact if not more because they have really played up jory to this point i personally dont think ned has been powered up as much as many people suggest the books just dont say enough on the matter to know one way or the other as has been pointed out it is entirely within the realm of possibility that ned could more than hold his own even book ned and book jaime for the length of their fight im a kstate fan and we have beat the powerhouse texas longhorns the last three times weve played them in football two of those times they were a top 10 team ksu is not even close to the same level of talented as the texas football team and yet they still won even if jaime is far and above neds skill level he still has to win the fight he isnt just declared the winner because of the stats to carry an analogy too faras for the argument put forth by some that ned would be out of practice and is just a tired old politician i laugh at that so ned couldnt possibly be practicing and training the intervening years he was in winterfell just because robert let himself go doesnt mean that ned did as welli also strongly disagree with your take on the cerseirobert scene but enough other people have attacked you for it and voiced pretty much my thoughts that i dont think it is necessary for me to do soand sorry dont mean to pick on you or anything i just found your post to be a useful foil to organize my own thoughts"

"Jaime Lannister",2011-05-17,"the first half of the episode was great second half felt like the worst part of the season so far to me slow paced and full of scenes we could have done without or could have been a whole lot shorter allowing more time for better things like showing more of the pageantry of the tourney for examplethe cerseirobert scene was like fingers scratching slowly down a blackboard in my mind i loathed and detested every fucking second of it the very idea that these two characters who hate and despise each other would sit down and have an honest deep calm rational human and adult conversation about the truth of their marriage just reeked of total bullshit to methats not merely a book verses tv opinion it is clear from previous scenes and presumably future scenes too from every episode of the tv show itself that these characters would never be capable of having that conversation they argue heatedly they fight theres physical abuse she aborts and kills his children some have suggested that it would not be impossible for them to have done this at some point in their 17 year history but i categorically disagree with that opinion it is out of character for them in the context of the tv show as well as the book near the beginning of this episode robert is saying how cersei was forced on him by jon arryn and as we know cersei is plotting to have robert killedit just does not make logical sense for them to sit down and have a heart to heart about how much they hate each other they might has well have hugged it out afterward because that would not have been any more out of character than what was saidyes the scene was well acted and i can appreciate some people loved it but it totally utterly and completely failed for mei dont mean to pile on since i see a few other posters already took you to task for this but i couldnt resist saying how much i disagree with your assessment edited by jaime lannister 17 may 2011  0304 pm"

"alguien",2011-05-17,"if dragons are the real and powerfull weapon against the others then he definitaly wants daenerys as head of the 7 kingdomsi mean the name of the series is a song of ice and fire not game of thrones the prologue is so good because it shows you that the real story is about this impressive force gathering in the north while the kingdom falls to piece and is at its weakest point when the others comethat is also the reason why i think the prologue was one of the worst scenes of the tv series the others just werent dangerous enough in the book they mock and toy with an armed man and uterly destroy him easilyi think vaerys is the only guy who really knows what is going in the whole world and that knows the others are really a threatthe only fly in that soup is that varys has emphatically stated he hates magic and will do everything in his power to stop it and if the maesters are to be believed dragons are sort of the catalyst for all magic in the worlddont get me wrong i think varys is loyal to the targaryens i once argued very forcefully that he had targaryen blood in him but it will be interesting to see what he thinks of the dragons edited by alguien 17 may 2011  0346 pm"

"red snow",2011-05-17,"easily my favourite episode of the season the main reason was that they have scenes that werent in the book but fit really well in the show and the book itself im pleased its not being a slave to the books pov structure and i hope they keep it up as ive always felt that theres no point in the show if it just reiterates the books as for the new scenes i enjoyed theon good to see more foreshadowing for the character as hes going to be central in season 2 plus the sex scene checks the hbo bushnob quota renly and loras i could almost imagine this happening as a cut scene from the book in terms of justifying renlys decision to try and be king i also thought that the queen of thorns has been grooming loras and that hes not just the pretty knight he often seems in the book it also checks the hbo gay quota the only downside is that loras seems terribly miscast he has the chest of a prepubescent and they seem to be making renly into a bit of a joke littlefinger and varys this had the kewl factor and was a nice little pissing contest in terms of littlefinger never using that info about varys meeting im not so sure all they need to do is to have varys get some info on lf and they will be at a stalemate again eg the lannisters wouldnt be too happy if varys told them lf was helping convince ned that they are incestuous and the children illegitimate heirs cersei and robert quite a touching scene and lena headey did a good job of getting us to feel sympathy for her while the end of the episode felt ott it fits with the action ned of the tv show ncw sold me on his portrayal of jaime when he swaggered over to ned that was jaime through and through i cant wait to see jaime getting the meatier scenes  the chat with catelyn in season 2 should be dynamite so yeah pretty damn happy with this episode and hope it maintains it through to episode 10 smilegif classbbcemoticon alt "

"The Anti-Targ",2011-05-18,"i think in the book renlys power as a charismatic leader kind of comes out of nowhere also he was mostly a shadow figure in got and in clash of kings you mainly becomes awed at his power and his host just for him to get killed by a shadow a few chapters after im pretty sure all his power is show only in two cat chapters after that he just gets ownedperhaps but among the first descriptions of renly in the book especially neds intial thoughts on seeing him at his first small council meeting suggests theres a certain kingly presence to renly ned thinks seeing renly now is like seeing bob as he was during the rebellion theres still 5 episodes of the season to go so renlys public persona might get a bit more treatment to get the audience more on side with him as a realistic prospect for kingof course prospects for the arse to occupy the iron throne after bob are limited to joff stannis and renly as it comes down to that choice a pussy scared of his own blood renly starts to look not all that bad of a choice for house tyrell to throw their weight behind on the say so of their favourite sonif it wasnt for a shared adoption of the minority faith of the lord of light i dont think anyone would throw their lot in with stannis even though if the truth was acknowledged im sure its kinda known or at least strongly suspected on the part of many or at least varys and perhaps littlefinger know and the laws properly applied stannis would be crowned king but who cares about laws when power and control though obviously not wealth are up for grabs"
"red snow",2011-05-18,"we need to remember that renly was the spitting image of the young rebel robert too so they pretty much threw that out the window too it will be interesting to see how renly is portrayed through the rest of the season if he is more charismatic and tough when around others as seemed the case with lf at the tourney then it will be a great bit of characterisation that he has this softerfragile side behind closed doors hopefully the guy playing loras will get himself down to the gym as with a little bit of tone hell look more like a fighter i just remembered the mountain cutting the horses head off it has to be a good episode when that scene slips your mind"

"Ser_Niall",2011-05-18,"my thoughts on this episode and the series so far sorry if some of this has been mentioned before the tourney  i dont have a problem with the fact that it only has the important jousts in it namely the ones involving the mountain too many jousts would have slowed the story down do wish they would have included a bigger crowd for atmosphere though hate the way renly and loras are portrayed i never got the impression that renly was a super effeminate weakling from the books however at least he has more muscle definition than loras he looks like a 10 year old boy in the manscaping scene it looks like he couldnt even lift the lance let alone unhorse the mountain really wish they were a little more subtle with the renlyloras relationship it is ok to leave something to the imagination i dont have a problem with gay relationships but its as taboo in westeros as it is in the real world they should have kept it more of an implied relationship at least until later seasons i enjoy the way cersei and jaime are being portrayed jaime is perfect after this episode the nonbook reading audience will definitely start hating him as they should until storm of swords cersei is a bit different than how she is in the book but it works for the show i think theyre making us a bit more sympathetic towards her which will make her later actions seem that much more deplorable lysas crazy was spot on just wish they would have gone with a fatter actress to match her description in the book bronn was perfect going to great hearing his lines smilegif classbbcemoticon alt "

"Cereal Forel",2011-05-18,"we also need to keep in mind that while renly is obviously gay based on his scene with loras when not in private weve been given no hints whatsoever that he isnt a masculine heterosexual male i expect its probably the worst kept secret in westeros just like it is in the book but only time will telli know its difficult but we shouldnt really judge the character based on one scene by the end of the first season he could be portrayed as a completely different character maybe we will see him joust practice maybe maybe his charisma will shine through if we see him in scenes other than in the small council who knows"

"Wunhopkuendo",2011-05-18,"i dont have a problem with renly showing a softer side in private but i was very surprised that he balked at the sight of blood since any guy who trained as a knight would have gotten his fair share of cuts and as other people have mentioned loras oohing and ahhing about his lovers charisma doesnt carry much weight since hes either biased or trying to manipulate him renly hasnt shown himself to be charismatic in public yet though of course he might in the future with the sloppy sword fighting i was mainly thinking of jaimes guys in the jaimened scene and how generic the faceoff between gregor and sandor was but then again ive been spoiled by spartacus which features a much flashier style with no bulky armor to slow everything down really the swordfighting thing was a minor complaint and im sure itll improve over the course of the show the episode was very strong overallah this explains a lot i think people today have been fed enough flashy yet unrealistic tv and movie fighting scenes that the flashy has become synonymous with realistic sword fighting i hate to be the one to inform everyone that the easter bun isnt real but what you see on tv especially spartacus which was the most unrealistic sword fighting i have ever seen anywhere isnt how people fight with swords in play much less when life is on the line this is also medieval time frame with medieval weapons armor and of course fighting techniques they probably havent incorporated asian style martial arts into their everyday repertoire what i loved most about the jaimened fight is that jaime is taken aback by how fiercely ned attacks him in that no joking manner jaime has been only tournament fighting for the last 9 years so he isnt expecting such a fierce attack by such an old man hence the brief smile at what was almost a fatal error on his part he readjusts and turns the tables a bit ned has to take a step back to catch his breath and a spear to the leg in the end i am sure that jaime would have beaten ned in that fight but it was much more difficult than jaime had at first anticipated as for ned being such a good fighter isnt it possible that living in the north has provided him with some practice against hill tribes or wildlings that slip past the wall or any number of non law abiding groups at a minimum having been in two major wars in the last two decades keeps his skills up with practice"
"The Knight of Grasses",2011-05-18,"as someone who knows nothing on swordfighting technique other than what ive read in fantasy novels sopretty much nothing the battles look fine to me and im guessing thats the case with 98 of the people watching the show it seems like the only ones complaining about the sloppiness are knowledgeable about sword fights and see problems that others wont because they dont have the experience i suppose im fortunate they dont have any scenes of littlefinger talking about accounting rules because then id get all nitpicky too wait you cant expense the cost of those horses those are clearly fixed assets that need to be depreciated over their useful lives this show has gotten so sloppy although i suppose westeros could have its own version of fasb that has allowed that accounting treatment everything needs to be given a costbenefit analysis in this case the producers thought okay we could spend thousands of dollars more delay production and take hours of extra time to perfect the choreography all in the name of making the sword fights more realistic which will probably only be noticeable to only 2 of our viewers or we could spend that money and time elsewhere and produce fights that will be fine for 98 of our viewers the choice was easy the producers realize they didnt create the best fight scenes ever and theyre almost certainly okay with it because the benefit pleasing a few people who will probably watch no matter how sloppy the scenes are didnt outweigh the cost"

"Manakhkubar",2011-05-18,"everything needs to be given a costbenefit analysis in this case the producers thought okay we could spend thousands of dollars more delay production and take hours of extra time to perfect the choreography all in the name of making the sword fights more realistic which will probably only be noticeable to only 2 of our viewers or we could spend that money and time elsewhere and produce fights that will be fine for 98 of our viewers the choice was easy the producers realize they didnt create the best fight scenes ever and theyre almost certainly okay with it because the benefit pleasing a few people who will probably watch no matter how sloppy the scenes are didnt outweigh the costnot just that if they really tried to make fight scenes realistic a whole lot of people would be argueing how unrealistic those scenes look much more than the relatively few nitpickers now me included hack even among experts there is a extreme wide range of incompatible believes what styles existed when how and so onbesides realistic sword fighting would be impossible to be shot with actors like sean bean edited by manakhkubar 18 may 2011  0245 pm"

"Chirios",2011-05-18,"this part clearly shows how little you know about the difference in asian martial arts and european it goes much further than both have double edged blades everything about the styles are completely different because the fighters builds were different the armor was certainly different and the lineage was vastly different a chinese dao sword with its double edged blade is not meant to pierce armor in the same way if at all in fact it is considered bad form in a chinese sword fight to touch blades at all but doing that in a movie would be heralded as unrealistic and too matrixlike the japanese art iaido has thousands of moves that originate from a sheathed sword and are meant to be a single slice to kill your opponent without touching their sword or armor watch some old kurosawa samurai movies and see how little the blades touch if at all in got they are using european style swords and armor which is much heavier and requires stronger swings and thrusts to overcome the weight of the blade and the thickness of the armor the style of fighting in got as xenophon points out is using moves more along the lines of german fencing techniques i have quite a number of years in training with chinese weapons of all kinds i can wield a sword for hours on end and not be all that sore or tired i have tried the same movements with medieval weapons and i am pretty gassed after about 5 minutesiaido uses a katana which has a single edge so the moves by definition will be different from a longsword which has two edges the same is true of the dao the jian has two edges but that is much thinner than the average longsword would be and therefore the moves are slightly different the average longsword in medieval times weighed between 25 pounds a katana weighs about 2 pounds a 70 cm jian weighed about 2 pounds anything else would be prohibitively heavyi didnt say that they would be the same i said that they would be similar western and asian martial arts all took into account the use of angles they all took into account using wrestling techniques of some sort to trip up disarm your opponent yes the heavier plate affected the growth of western fencing but the techniques generally werent to hammer through the plate it was to attack the joints and those areas which the plate armour couldnt fit over and were only protected by mail under the arms the neck the groin there are only so many ways you can cut someone"

"Lord Varys",2011-05-19,"well renlys comment sounded a little too true to me and it was supposed to reveal something about littlefinger  the fact that he truly has no friends and that his talk to cat might most likely have been just talk and the way renly said it and the way littlefinger reacted to it seemed more on a not so friendly basis at least no on the level of friendliness id expect of them its quite different when he later asks what varys and littlefinger are plotting there it is a friendly joke and none of them acts weird and starts to ask renly what he has done since they last saw each other and then there is the fact that the interview with the actor and the writers indicated that renly is really supposed to be a nice goodhearted guy he does what is necessary to protect the realm and his family thats why he goes along with the dany murder plot but he does not feel good about these things he does not like to fight wars or kill innocent so it makes not that much sense that he should be really close to a person like littlefinger littlefinger staring at the iron throne is more than ominous as well its more than a nod to the thing he truly wants in the end and if he does not want to sit personally in it he wants what it represents ie power and control over westeros i think you really get to much clues that littlefinger is not really that trustworthy and a somewhat unsavory character the whole thing about the fresh corpses did not let him appear sanefriendlynice at all that should not be the case at least not to this extent before acok tyrion is only brother to the queen he is a courtier if he cares to attend the court which he most likely did at least since joffreys 12th name day but he holds neither official office on the small council or somewhere else in the administration nor title this might be somewhat irritating as tyrion really falls in love with power way too quick in acok to be entirely uninterested in theses things and although cersei does not like tyrion very much one could actually expect her to press robert to find a position for her brother on the small council"

"gullyfoyle",2011-05-21,"jaime pov amongst the living greatjon umber was stronger strongboar of crakehall most likely both cleganes for a certainty the mountains strength was like nothing human it did not matter with speed and skill jaime could beat them all thanks for posting this i was trying to remember exactly who jaime said was stronger than him of course strength isnt everything fighting skill is even more important not sure how much of that you can get from tournamentstrying to take someone down in a tournament is different than trying to kill them even if there were plenty of wounds and even deaths in tournaments in medieval times this was definitely the best episode for battles so far but overall it was my least favorite due to the scenes with renlyloras and littlefingervarys some worthwhile exposition in those but the gay sex and talk of sex with little boys amputees and corpses was very offputting someone mentioned hbo making their quota with those scenes and ive had the same problem with hbo before eg true blood  sex and violence that detracts from rather than aiding the story count me as one who liked the jaimened fight i dont think we can assume ned has rarely raised a sword since roberts and balon greyjoys rebellions the north is a dangerous place there are wildlings who climb over the wall for raids occasional reavers from the iron islands despite the truce maybe restless bannermen who need to be put down from time to time i liked the mountain clan attack scene too except for the very end bronn a mercenary of vast experience sticks his sword covered with blood and who knows what else back in the scabbard without even cleaning it and when theres so many convenient bodies to wipe it off on its a little thing i know but it took me out of the moment the tournament yes hbo could have shown a few more jousts or a melee and more crowds and pageantry perhaps it was a budget decision but there are plenty of fans whod have appearted as extrass for free unless thats against union rules or something the fight between sandor and gregor clegane looked fine people dont move at lightning speed with big swords and heavy armor even if your strength is like nothing human other standout scenes were the robert and cersei breakfast discussion mostly because the actors are good but it does make sense that theyd reach an accommodation and have occasional civil conversations after 17 years of marriage and arya wandering through the crypts of the castle and hiding in the mighty dragons skull i even thought she might be permanently separated when the guards didnt let her in and the great pullout when tyrion looks over the edge of the sky cell i signed up with hbo specifically to watch this show because im a big fan of the books and its an incredible rarity to see a fantasy show thts not aimed at kids will proably keep watching for the rest of the series but then cancel my subsciption til next year"

"Arataniello",2011-05-15,"ok this was the first episode where i was impressed there was action instead of just characters talking to one another in static groups plenty of actual gore  the horse head the fight on the way to the eyrie the fight at the end the shots of tyrion in the skycell was the first time i actually got a feeling of oh wow  they have managed to capture the sense of imagination that i got when reading the books for the first time lysa was a bit too thin and drawn  she is supposed to be bulging and sagging as described when sansa and cat both see her spearately for the first time i thought that these scenes that were added varys and littlefinger cersei and robert seemed to actually work in that they added a little bit of nuance to everything loras and renly manscaping  not so much plus loras suggesting to renly that he could be king  is that from the books maybe there was a throwaway comment by another character about it bran and luwin was a nice little scene plus it gave the producers a chance to work in some more of the background"

"melicorn",2011-05-15,"i feel like the only reason the lorasrenly relationship is seen as subtle is because neither of them really get that much screen time in the books certainly if one of them had the chance to be a viewpoint character there would have been nothing subtle about it although i did always imagine loras as a little prettier and much more decorated i think showing sapphires on his horse would have been a better indication of the riches of the tyrells than him just dully mentioning it also renly has almost a year to toughen up doesnt he well maybe six months i was never that great at keeping track of time in the books and the main issue i have with so much theon setup is that its really going to take the punch out of his betrayal what made it so gutwrenching and enraging for me is that it came with so little warning although i am another one of those that needed a few extra hints to guess jons parentage so maybe there were more hints there and it makes robb look a little dumber for not seeing all of theons pentup rage unless hopefully they give robb a lot more screen time to show his reasoning which looks like it will happen starting with the next episode i really enjoyed the added scene with cersei and robert i think its one of the very few chances theyve really given robert to show he is not a complete ass he just doesnt care about her plus after 17 years of marriage it just wouldnt make sense to have them always ignoring one another i like seeing the uneasy truce they developed in the books the nature of their relationship was always given through one person describing it to someone else for television it is better to get some firsthand views i loved the scene with varys and littlefinger i think thats much more important foreshadowing than anything with theon their little rivalry certainly has much greater influence on the story although in the books littlefinger is the only character whose motivations remain almost entirely inscrutable to me and i havent really got that impression from the tv series yet finally the eyrie i am somewhat disappointed that they cut out the climb to the top because i love mya stone however i can understand how that would have been tedious and difficult to convey on television but where was the blackfish"

"melicorn",2011-05-15,"hmm i disagree i think with the added emphasis on theons character it will add to his betrayal especially if the show developes the close friendship with robb that was hinted at in the books it will make his character arc more tragic for the viewer and i cant wait still you could be right and i could be wrongno i think you are right and it will make his overall arc more tragic i just dont want it to be tragic because i hate theon so much hah i was so disappointed when a friend pointed out to me that he was probably not really flayed alive at least not completely because no other pov characters had died offscreensomewhat offtopic now i am wondering hbo will have any onscreen flayings especially after seeing a horse beheaded i might have to stop watching if it gets to that i know theyre only hinted at in the books but obviously weve seen that means its not offlimits"
"VikingLegion",2011-05-15,"i admit was i concerned with how the fight between ned and jaime would go i like how they did it im glad that they werent building up ned to have him completely outclassed by jaime jaime was badass but ned held his own until another guard stepped in sad to see jory die at jaimes hand but i figured they would do this after they had jory talk with jaime in the previous episodei was pretty nervous for this fight i knew ned had to lose but i really wanted him to give a good showing of himself  especially with all the little sniping and shittalking jaimened have engaged in various scenes so farit seemed clear to me that jaime was the strongerquickermore skilled fighter and if nobody intervened wouldve dispatched ned his moves seemed effortless whereas ned was laboring a bit more but im glad they made ned hold his own and hey  maybe if the fight had continued he couldve pulled something crazy out of his ass and beaten jaime with a surprise move the younger man hasnt seen before ageexperience winning out over youthful vigor and all that unlikely i know butjorys death was so sudden i thought he and jaime would cross swords for at least a few more seconds but wow did the kingslayer make short work of him alas poor jory"

"Jaime L",2011-05-15,"fair enough and i agree the outside of the eyrie i thought was poor but the high hall and the sky cells were spot onhonestly i thought the eyrie was incredible had no idea how the show would capture the feel of the place from the books but this exceeded all expectations i mean sure it was cgi but i was pretty sure they werent going to build an impregnable citadel on an unreachable mountain just for filming everything about the eyrie and the arryns was spot on imoanyway thought all the disparate plotlines the show was weaving really came together in this episode probably helped to have no jon or dany diversion just keep it on the heart of the drama which really was kings landing and the eyrie thought the most interesting factor of the series is the omniscient viewpoint we now have we see renly and loras varys and lf robert and cersei having frank meaningful conversations about subjects that take books to glean out because were limited by our first person narrators its a real interesting gambit to lay all the cards out on the table really allow us to empathize with all the major players from the get go as opposed to halfway through storm of swords so far though think its both nuanced and effective but we still get the satisfying moments of lf being supremely cunning and shifty and jaime being appropriately vile as he jams a knife into jorys eye brilliant episode really think the episode can and should serve as the moment where it really starts to click for nonreaders"

"Myrish swan",2011-05-15,"i liked this episode i continue to be impressed with the kid who plays bran a fantastic actor in that vein im going to voice a totally unpopular opinion and say i am not actually bowled over by the girl who plays aryas acting she is good very good for her age however considering the amount of praise shes been getting id expect her to be a bit better she seems a bit wooden at times and at others her line delivery seems a bit off somehow the same is true of sophie turner as sansa however she has certainly been criticized plenty thus far however i thought her facial expressions at the tournament were pretty well done her line delivery not so much tyrion was awesome though he has many of the same lines in the book i get a far different feeling from peter dinklige than i did from book tyrion the passive aggressiveness spite and misogyny are simply not there in the book i found his line im willing if she is sort of creepy and yes i do realize it was a joke and meant to be funny however i also couldnt help but feel that in the book version tyrion was bringing cat down a peg and sort of degrading her in front of bronn in making that comment its like he wants to bond with bronn and the other dudes there by saying creepy sexual stuff about cat yuck however here the line was delivered very lightly it seemed as though tyrion was talking to himself more than anything more or less saying yeah thats about the last thing in the world that is gonna happen once again mark addy really impressed me as king robert the scene with ned was poignant to say the least by the look on neds face you could see his mingled disappointment and sorrow over what his once great friend had become though roberts way more of a creep here than in the books i feel for him far more here in the books though nicer he never really felt like a fully realized character to me that was partially because he was very much in the mold of the jolly washed up old soldier archetype partially because i suspect grrm took pains to make him far more sympathetic than cersei whom he obviously wanted to be the clear cut villain and speaking of cersei i dont get all the hate for making her a fairly more complex character than in the books all of the stuff thats been highlighted in the series thus far cersei being forced to witness her husband philandering robert being intentionally cruel to cersei cersei having to grit her teeth and smile through a miserable marriage all of these things are true of the cersei in the books too however grrm does everything to draw attention away from this lest a few readers actually sympathize with this woman he loathes so much in the books grrms hatred of her is so strong its ridiculous still in the first three books despite doing everything he can to manipulate readers to hate her he managed to draw a believable and complex portrait of cerseiand then in affc he pretty much destroys the character he takes a complex villain and turns her into a shrieking caricature its as though he takes every possible excuse for cersei ambiguity about her motives or possible justifications for her behavior and says nope not true shes just a total evil bitch with no redeeming qualities okay seriously he takes pains to show that being married to an abusive drunk did no real damage to her since she was a murdering sociopath at age 9 despite the fact that the whole murdering melara story makes no sense for purely practical reasons he also makes sure that its clear that she doesnt love jaime is blatantly cruel for no reason neither of which appeared to be true before cersei could certainly be cruel but there were always reasons behind her cruelty and of course lets not forget that she does not really love her kids at all despite ample evidence in the first three books that she truly did at any rate i have no idea why people insist on seeing the caricature of affc rather than an actual believable character even villains suffer even villains have reasons for being the way they are is it so hard to believe that cersei has suffered that like nearly everyone else the things she has gone through have had some influence on shaping who she eventually became in addition i can appreciate how the show writers do not delight in saying creepy offensive sexual stuff about cersei that is another thing that i<U+0080><U+0099>m not crazy about in the books edited by myrish swan 15 may 2011  1142 pm"

"Myrish swan",2011-05-15,"i have a theory that theyre making her more sympathetic so that when its revealed that her kids are jaimes and she killed her first born and she has the rest of roberts bastards put to death it really flips the switch on herre the kids being jaime<U+0092>s<U+0097>i<U+0092>ve got to ask does this really make cersei straight up evil why should she be faithful to robert honestly why should she have the children of a man she loathes a man who has made her miserable having kids with jaime is sick weird and vengeful but not pure proof that cersei is pure evil as you seem to be implying re putting the bastards to death<U+0097>definitely something that is evil horrible and unforgivable however in the books she did that only to protect her own children which brings me to<U+0085>cersei <U+0093>killing her firstborn<U+0094> as you say now i<U+0092>ve been thinking about this a lot lately and i<U+0092>ve come to the conclusion that yeah the show probably is going to go this route and their main motive will probably be to make sure that viewers see that cersei is the truly evil one robert and ned are good otherwise even if she had had children with her brother and killed robert<U+0092>s bastards to protect said children i suspect some viewers might still sympathize with her or if not sympathize than some might at least pose the question was cersei really so much more evil than her husband king robert after all he did hit and abuse her and all of the evil stuff she did she did for her children obviously asking such questions would ruin the message grrm wants to send with cersei it would also shake cersei<U+0092>s place as the villain of the series something that grrm has been clear about from the beginning so yeah they probably are going to throw cersei murdering her firstborn in there however i think this is a heavy handed and stupid move and i truly hope they do not go this route though i strongly suggest they will this is because it totally goes against cersei<U+0092>s character as she was presented in the first three books as with grrm<U+0092>s <U+0093>cersei<U+0094> chapters in affc making cersei kill her firstborn is making cersei act out of character for the sake of showing her as unforgivable pure evil etc however in the books and here thus far cersei loves her children and would do anything for them i cannot picture her murdering her already born child even her child by robert and yes i realize that she did drink the moon tea to get rid of robert<U+0092>s baby in the books however aborting a fetus that is a few months old is totally different from killing an already born baby"

"Rockroi",2011-05-16,"maybe my favorite episode so far this season what i likedned v jaime lets just take the gloves off and lets just get right down to it enough of the pointcounterpoint enough of the whoshouldhavekilledaerys enough of the who owes what to whom lets just fucking try to kill each other while neither one of us is actually trying to kill the other lets see who is actually the better man i like that jaime was theer without armor sword at the ready and with eyes only for ned even when he took jorys out with his dagger that sword fight was epic i knew neither would die but  but i guess i wanted to see who would win when the soldier interfered as i think we all knew he would jaimes reaction was priceless now ill never know but neds was better i have 2 feet of pine sticking out of my leg three of my men are dead i am on my knees and bleeding maybe to death but you lannister will not hear me scream it really was the wolf and the lion cersei v robert easily the most controversial scene in the episode people just dont like having a more sympathetic cersei well sorry but i think we all should have had some sympathy for her for reasons expressed time and time again robert illustrated perfectly why he is terrified of a targaryen resurgence on the back of dothrakai screamers for the first time we saw a man who actually had foresight and vision even if it was at the end of a lance he sees what his realms problems are and how a targaryen resurgence is possible and in his voice just that hint of paranoia over ned over jaime over tywin over cersei over himself but cersei had this scene the whole time this is her husband and she spoke to him like a wife calling him robb taking his bait on the which is greater 5 or 1 question and then finally giving him the out she wants to hear tell me we could have made it together thats all i ask tell me you could see in me something you could not see in lyanna that these 17 years together were not all for nothing and robert was once again so brutally honest he doesnt even remember what lyanna looked like but he remembers what she made him feel like the reason i liked that scene was because we come facetoface with true fleshed out people and not the shadowy people we have come to know through martins pov system please do not mistake me martins pov system is tremendous and adds so much to the story but there are things lost in it as well are we to believe these two people never had this kind of talk it would be barbaric no when push comes to shove there is some respect for the other enough to try to see the other enough to still try to hurt the other and then deny the painand addys robert is now officially the character in the series who improved the most on the books second is viserys jury still out on cersei bran v cat through her proxy master lewyn maybe the best scene in the show that didnt involve swords bran shows us how hurt he has been for being abandoned sure he has a castle around him and sure he has sworn men and masters etc but abandoned is abandoned and thats how he feels and i like how arya is not the only smart child i like that bran actually has feelings that would be be expected in a child his age the hound v the mountain i was afraid they were not going to include this nice to see the spirit of the book carried through great stuff and i like watching the hound and the mountain swing swords at each other loras v renly maybe the most important scene in the show this scene answered an ageold question what the fuck got into renly that made him think he could upjump stannis even after you get past the abominations how do you get it in your head that you and not stannis should be king maybe a little flower told you and maybe just maybe you are a little peeved that you had no war to fight no castle to hold for a year no prince to sink your war hammer into that sounded a lot less gay inside my head i like that we finally got some meat on the renly bone that sounded gay the whole time the scene was a little heavyhanded but it was worth ittyrion v lysa arryn i like this new imagined lysa fuck the fat shes just batshit crazy and skinny and they kept in the 5year old breast feeding creepe she sits on that dead wirewood throne and you think for a second she may sprout wings and try to feed off the dead great job and i like the call back to return of the king remember if somebody is left in charge of a mideval castle and its located very high up on say a mountain they turn crazy bank on it not sure aboutloras v renly look i get it theyre gay but do they have to be that  gay i mean okay fine he likes hairless men but two characters have not touched themselves that much in any scene so why does it has to be via creepy shaving and could we have had more slurping sounds on blow job scene and please im no prude because its homosexual attraction i think its fine if we saw them boffing its the creepyness factor like looking at theons glissening wang i dont mind that i see it as much as i see it like glowing in the dark theon v the world okay we can kind of get it now hes pissed because hes a wardhostage fine did we need two more scenes of it we could have easily put in more tyrion with thatdid not likevarys v littlefinger uh the whole point is that they dont ever fight out in the open ever yes i get it we needed that scene so that we could  wait we didnt need that scene in the book it really was just filler emolorase when he ever came out trapsing on the horse long hair lazily flowing that rose limply in his hand i mean did you expect him to joust or talk about how much he hated his materialistic parents i honestly expected him to pull out a guitar and say i wrote this song last night while i was

"Ormond",2011-05-16,"maybe my favorite episode so far this season what i likedned v jaime lets just take the gloves off and lets just get right down to it enough of the pointcounterpoint enough of the whoshouldhavekilledaerys enough of the who owes what to whom lets just fucking try to kill each other while neither one of us is actually trying to kill the other lets see who is actually the better man i like that jaime was theer without armor sword at the ready and with eyes only for ned even when he took jorys out with his dagger that sword fight was epic i knew neither would die but  but i guess i wanted to see who would win when the soldier interfered as i think we all knew he would jaimes reaction was priceless now ill never know but neds was better i have 2 feet of pine sticking out of my leg three of my men are dead i am on my knees and bleeding maybe to death but you lannister will not hear me scream it really was the wolf and the lion cersei v robert easily the most controversial scene in the episode people just dont like having a more sympathetic cersei well sorry but i think we all should have had some sympathy for her for reasons expressed time and time again robert illustrated perfectly why he is terrified of a targaryen resurgence on the back of dothrakai screamers for the first time we saw a man who actually had foresight and vision even if it was at the end of a lance he sees what his realms problems are and how a targaryen resurgence is possible and in his voice just that hint of paranoia over ned over jaime over tywin over cersei over himself but cersei had this scene the whole time this is her husband and she spoke to him like a wife calling him robb taking his bait on the which is greater 5 or 1 question and then finally giving him the out she wants to hear tell me we could have made it together thats all i ask tell me you could see in me something you could not see in lyanna that these 17 years together were not all for nothing and robert was once again so brutally honest he doesnt even remember what lyanna looked like but he remembers what she made him feel like the reason i liked that scene was because we come facetoface with true fleshed out people and not the shadowy people we have come to know through martins pov system please do not mistake me martins pov system is tremendous and adds so much to the story but there are things lost in it as well are we to believe these two people never had this kind of talk it would be barbaric no when push comes to shove there is some respect for the other enough to try to see the

"smegma",2011-05-16,"favorite episode so far some points  loras looks exactly like the kind of boy that teen girls dream of hes made to not look hot but really pretty think leo dicaprio in titanic  i always kind of hated that lysa had gone fat in madness to me this skinny version was much more apropos definitely a fake breast but still excellently creepy  cat did a great job of showing just a hint of doubt at tyrions character  i love the casting of marillion hes cute and has a nice voice  i think the scene between loras and renly did a wonderful job of showing so many things their relationship the tyrells lorass thirst for battle how renly gets the idea for being king how he is well loved etc i really liked that he didnt like blood i think it is a change from the book but it shows how renly would not have been a bloodthirsty king but rather only doing only what was required of him and how he hates the idea of killing dany and viserys but concedes that its probably the wisest thing  so we get the infamous scene between cersei and robert that the critics were raving about i see what they mean excellent i loved the line about her speaking and tywins words coming out totally establishes what moves she makes next  miss jon and dany but i get why they didnt go there and i think it was a wise decision  loved brans scene i think it gave some great exposition but also showed him hurting for his mother still created a niggling in the back of my mind that they are setting bran up to be evil ala evil bran theory i both hope its not true and that it is  i can go either way  theon was given more exposition hes good at archery treats women badly has a chip on his shoulder but still shows respect to the starks almost unconsciously  but hes being called out on it more and more sets his arc up nicely  jory sadgif classbbcemoticon alt  my favorite incidental character i loved jaimes expressions as they were fighting and the best part was hitting the soldier that stabbed ned  omg fire nina gold the cat was too small lmaogif classbbcemoticon altlmao  edited by smegma 16 may 2011  1239 am"

"Winterfelled",2011-05-16,"i have never been one who believed that adaptations are married to the source material no matter how good that source is and i expected differences between the books and the show so far i have been thrilled by the changes because nothing is lost and it allows the characters and the show a little room to breathe what is the point of adaptation if its going to be a shotforshot remake just read the books if thats all you want i love that cersei is so wellrounded in the show thats the whole calling card of the series that everyone is sympathetic in some way and that even the good guys do things that could be viewed as naive and selfish fleshing cersei out a bit has been brilliant and lena is up to the task this episode was by far the best of the series i think there havent been any clunkers but last weeks effort was a marked improvement over the somewhat lifeless third episode and tonights show was even better than that and thats what we want isnt it a show that gets better every week theres a lot of exposition but with so much important history and backstory to relay it cant be avoided theyve done an admirable job of keeping the as you know bob conversations to a minimum im failing to understand why people are complaining about the theon scenes since the people complaining obviously have read the books and know how he becomes a pretty major character later on when theon goes home later on how is the viewer going to share in his alienation if the place feels foreign to them keeping theon on stage is vital for that otherwise nobody is going to care great series better than i could have hoped i really wish people would stop nitpicking"

"Kat",2011-05-16,"first the important bites loras looks exactly like the kind of boy that teen girls dream of hes made to not look hot but really pretty think leo dicaprio in titanic yeah when i read the books the picture in my mind was a slightly younger heath ledger in a knights tale i remember when i went to go see that at the seedy movie theater in the mall next to my high school and that afternoon the theater seemed to have been invaded by 8th grade girls who spent the first half of the movie going omgsqueeeeeee heath ledger hes so hott to the point where my loudmouth friend actually told them to stfu sit down and turn off their phones heh anyway yeah loras dreamboat totally rocked the dreamboat look when he was on his horse anywayin the books the dominant personality was clearly renly whereas here loras is evidently in charge just a curious switch imo yeah although we never really see them on their own in the books loras is totally full of teenage anger when he goes on a rampage after renlys death and i never get the idea that he was subordinate in their relationship he must at least have some of the characteristics of the rest of his scheming family who surely approves of his being in bed with someone high in the line of succession hes just not very good at playing his part not as smooth as olenna margaery or garlan and maybe too eager to please oooh pick me pick me my daddys rich and powerful not very subtle therei thought the lorasrenly scene was good it introduced more than just manscaping it introduced stannis it introduced the tyrells it also hinted at renly and loras ambition in the book we knew they were scheming to being maergary to court for tv purposes this was betteragree completely it was a scene with more than one purpose 1 readgif classbbcemoticon altread  2 droolgif classbbcemoticon altdrool in the novels renly is a knight he rode in the tourney hes an average knight apparently stannis mocks him for taking part to let better men defeat him but stillhes perfectly capable and willing to fight but he knows hes no great warrior like robert to go off and lead the vanguardon that either im misremembering or they switched the contests renly and robert were good at in tourneys wasnt robert supposed to be preparing for the melee while renly rode in the joust i thought that showed a bit more of their personalities in the book and was disappointed to see they had reversed those makes no sense with screen renly to prefer something up close and bloody if he doesnt like blood anywayi always thought renly was supposed to be a poor mans version of war hero robert but much better socially and politically and it would have been nice if they had been able to show renly as a bit of a popular party boy because that is how he earns his popularity anyway loras spells it out in the shaving scene but without showing it it does make you wonder why if renly isnt a fighter is his entire popularity based on being propped up by the tyrellsthis was my exact thought during that scene when robert said no he just sealed his fate in her mind and she felt nothingwasnt that part of the scene a version of something that cersei remembers or tells someone in the books i know theyve drastically changed the characterization of cersei an improvement imho but i do vaguely recall her getting totally ticked off on something robert said to piss her offit was an odd scene really im not sure what to make of it if robert and cersei hate each other so much how come they can have a little chat like this and be sowistfulnonchalant rather than outright loathing that weve seen them display elsewhere such as when robert wanted to go visit lyannas crypt or when hes drunk at the tourney or the feast at winterfell oddly intimate conversation between married frenemiescersei killing her firstborn as you say now ive been thinking about this a lot lately and ive come to the conclusion that yeah the show probably is going to go this route and their main motive will probably be to make sure that viewers see that cersei is the truly evil one robert and ned are good otherwise even if she had had children with her brother and killed roberts bastards to protect said children i suspect some viewers might still sympathize with her or if not sympathize than some might at least pose the question was cersei really so much more evil than her husband king robert after all he did hit and abuse her and all of the evil stuff she did she did for her childrenreally you think the portrayal of robert has been sympathetic in any way or made him look like a good guy to me its pretty clear that the production has him exactly as he should be a drunken bloodthirsty lout past his prime and a bit out of his element making cersei more sympathetic is not diminishing from the wretchedness of robert as a king only ned looks good in all thishonestly i thought the eyrie was incredible had no idea how the show would capture the feel of the place from the books but this exceeded all expectations i mean sure it was cgi but i was pretty sure they werent going to build an impregnable citadel on an unreachable mountain just for filming everything about the eyrie and the arryns was spot on imothe citadel was awesome my favorite castle so far and the long shot of the vale was my second favorite after the one of beyond the wall"
"DurararaFTW",2011-05-16,"i didnt have a problem with cersei and robert portrayal in the books robert was one of my favorite characters and his last scene is one of the saddest in series bar none affc may have shown her as more unstable then ever before but she was never suppose to be rational she was suppose to be the person that did a crappy job raisig joffrey turned robert into a shell of his former self did a crappy job controlling joffrey and eventually ran the realm into the ground over five years of rule affc merely sped up the processa song of ice and fire was a world filled with grey but required one truly good character an adult good guy that is ned and one truly bad one that actually took forefront in the story and good significant characterisation in spite or her role cersei cersei drew the short straw too badbut i like this more cersei and robert scene was great extra scene with bran and luwin was good i liked what the ned vs jaime fight did for jaimes character the gayness im meh toward i dont deny that it was canon but it was just something extra for those who are into that not so here varys and littlefinger i wasnt sure about though i do like that varys managed to get the last word inbarristan is getting shortchanged ned stands alone in convincing robert to not joust and not assassinate dany perhaps him being a pov character wasnt set in stone yet when this was shot but him being sympathetic to dany and aware of her continued existence as well as jorahs true nature is a important plot point"

"Tempra",2011-05-16,"re lorasi wonder just what people think loras should look like im getting the sense that some think he ought to be all rippling muscles and stuff thats thats not loras from the booki genuinely dont like commenting on peoples appearances for something subjective like beauty but i have a hard time seeing loras as a person that both guys and girls fawn over perhaps it is just the bad wig but he looks very androgynous and not at all comely"
"Joanna vander Poele",2011-05-16,"liked it a lot did not miss jon and dany at all sorry fans peter dinklage is consistently amazing even with only a handful of lines his flat delivery had me in stitches especially the eyrie scene oh my loras looked fine to me just wish hed had a bath beforehand and his helmet looked kind of dorky tonguegif classbbcemoticon altp  for some reason though i always imagined he was above the scheming nature of the other tyrells but maybe my memorys misplaced again either way i did enjoy his scene with renly mucho though i fear renly came off as a little too petulant and whiny i mean theres a way of complaining and not make it sound like youre a grumpy teenager but who knows the varyslittlefinger scene was hilarious chewing scenery all around and them scrambling to get the last one up on each other and the robertcersei scene was incredible the actors are a and nikolaj is more jaime than jaime damn i dont want this season to be half over sadgif classbbcemoticon alt  i cant even imagine how long itll take for acok to come out"
"Ormond",2011-05-16,"i only have time to comment on loras and renlyi am a gay man myself but it took me a while to be sure grrm meant them to really be gay while i was reading the books its been a long time but i dont think i had that figured out by the end of agot when others made remarks about them i wasnt quite sure at the start if they were really gay or if it was just a case of a homophobic culture where straight men insult other guys by accusing them of being gay when that isnt necessarily the case i certainly did have it figured out though well before affc i have very mixed emotions about the renlyloras scene i like them making the relationship obvious which is really appropriate in a scene where they are alone together which is something you never see in the books a lot of the information imparted in the scene was very valuable it could have certainly been imparted in a scene which made the nature of the relationship clear but which wasnt so overtly erotic  but the same thing could be said about the scene with viserys and the slave girl and this is the hbo sexploitation factor affecting the show i am a bit put off by what i see as a bit of the use of modern gay stereotypes however both the actors are slighter in build than i imagined loras and renly to be especially since loras like so many characters is supposed to be a bit older in the tv version than in the books and the whole idea of using the shaving of body hair as a trope really seems to play into what i think are a lot of false stereotypes many heterosexuals have about modern gay men there are a great many of us who prefer body hair and find shaved chests to be rather icky they did make this a bit less off by having renly be a bit surprised that loras would prefer him that way at least implying that renly himself isnt necessarily turned off by body hair but i think that passing comment will be all too easily overlooked by most of the viewing audience years ago i had a straight apartmentmate who was dating a young woman he told her i was gay before i met her and when she did she was really surprised that i was not tall and thin and dressed out of gentlemans quarterly i think the show is playing way too much into that silly gay stereotype here  as someone else said above the tv shows renly and loras are too much like abercrombie  fitch models on the other hand i really do love the idea of loras wanting to be the power behind the throne and being the one who implants the idea in renly that he should be the king its a great bit of characterization and enhances the depiction of their relationship i also dont think renlys squeamishness about blood is as bad a bit of characterization as many others on this thread do his level of blooddislike does not rise to that of a true blood or pain phobia or else he would have fainted andor been really angry with loras when he was deliberately cut and the whole point there is that loras is deliberately trying to desensitize him from his blooddislike i would assume at this point that this works and by the time we see renly in a battle scene he will have overcome that minor problem at least i hope thats the way they write it i also find it a bit amusing that some above use the fact that loras fellates renly as evidence that renly is really the dominant one in the relationship i never got the idea that grrm was implying that loras and renly had the sort of relationship thats common in latin america and some other parts of the world where one man takes the completely passive womans role in sex and the other one gets to be the real man who can deny that theres anything different about him i dont think the way loras is depicted in the books shows that he thinks of himself as some sort of substitute woman for renly or that renly thinks that of him in public loras would of course seem like the less powerful one in the relationship because of renly being the one who is the prince trying to become the king but that doesnt mean thats how they would have acted in private and the way loras uses the fellation in the scene seems to show him as having the real power in the relationship here using his wiles to manipulate renly to see himself as a claimant for the throne and i must admit that in spite of the actor playing loras not being my type and being one who prefers hairy chests to shaven ones the scene was nevertheless incredibly erotic droolgif classbbcemoticon altdrool  blushgif classbbcemoticon altblush "

"Warg Arry",2011-05-16,"i really liked the cerseirobert scene it was veryhuman i suppose you could say but aside from that we get another aspect of a person that has never been on screen and yet seems to be the most present i think we get to see how blind robert is where lyanna is concerned he can go and screw every whore in the kingdom have little bastards everywhere but that scene shows that robert would never allow himself to be in love with another woman and when you experience that emotion so strongly for someone its possible that they couldnt comprehend that the object of their affection may not feel the same way about them personally i think that scene sets up many future aspects and story line really well loved this episode makes me wish i owned the season on dvd so i could just watch each episodes back to back"

"Asharak",2011-05-10,"i think that<U+0092>s a really weird choice since most of the blackfish dialogue in got is either about the situation at the eyre or giving advice to robb or cat i would assume that some character has to say those things anyway so why not the blackfish i think this will be a really good episode anyway according to maureen ryan it<U+0092>s the best of the first six episodes by a big marginhttpwwwtvsquadcfantasyreview i suspect the ned and jaime confrontations will be one of the most memorable moments of the season edited by asharak 10 may 2011  0508 am"

"Lord Varys",2011-05-12,"id really appreciate it if ned would have not been made a good swordsman in the series that would have really gotten his whole conflict with jaime more on the emotional level with both of them more being concerned about honor rather than making it to some kind of pissing contest of course the honor thing is still there but the pissing contest is as well and we dont really need that jaime is somewhat haunted by neds cold stare and that has really nothing to do with him being a good swordsman it has to do with what eddard stark embodies as to ser barristan i like him well enough but he seems to be more some kind of aged assassin than the embodiment of chivalry to me i admit that liked him and jaime being almost friendly in episode 3 as i can see barristan thinking fondly of the man jaime lannister was before he became the kingslayer just as jaime liked to be remembered of the time where he was not yet the twisted guy he is now and we should also keep in mind that barristan joined the baratheon regime quickly enough right now he cannot be that disgusted neither openly nor inside by the likes of jaime as he himself serves the man who slew rhaegar and went along with the murder of elia and her children he is not much better than the kingslayer if you judge him with the high standards the kingsguard is judged under normal circumstances selmys conscience is only reappearing when joffreys fires him and i really hope they make this scene as powerful as it is in the book including his line about stannis taking away the iron throne from joffrey"

"Bronn Stone",2011-05-12,"the truth is we dont really have enough information about the rebellion and the battles fought in order to have an accurate opinion of neds skills either as a swordsman or a generalfrom the books we do not but when grrm is asked at a public event and says that ned was average that pretty much ends the debate he would be the one who would know"

"Lord Varys",2011-05-13,"tyrion never was a general just a guy who was supposed to lead a sortie and a bunch of expendable guys in a battle he had not the chance to lead from the rear because circumstances and gregor and his father commanded him to fight in the battle robert may have lead from the front that much i admit but about rhaegar im not sure if robert broke rhaegars lines at the trident it makes sense that wouldcould meet on the battlefield there is no indication that they met because they were both at the front of their armies robb loras and the young jaime were just stupid boys in a way and both loras and jaime never were good generals they are great warriors but essentially stupid generals robb did lead by example but he was not leading from the front else he would not have been surrounded by his guards when jaime attacked his standard in the whispering wood tywin and stannis most likely are both knights but they dont care about these stuff they command and to command you have to see what is going on the battlefield not be in the heat of battle and i really dont see ned to be as stupid as to lead from the front especially as he was only an average sword that would be way too risky robert was an exceptional warrior and he did not care what might happen to him but not ned ned looked on the numbers the ground and the best position for battle"

"HokieStone",2011-05-13,"i think theres evidence for him being a good fighter in the books and yeah the battle ended with howard reed and ned stark vs arthur dayne if the only reason nd stark wasnt effortlessly cut dow is because of howard reeds intervention and arthur dayne being busy killing another of his friends then im quite disappointed in ned for not mentioneing the friend that needed to die to make up for his lack of skill and jaime maybe exaggerating but he still singled out arthur dayne rather then barristan the bold or the white bull or rhaegar targaryan or robert baratheon all of which he served because the sword of mourning was the bestalright ive got to nitpick here because ive seen you call him howard a few times now its howland reed and its the sword of the morningunless the guy who wields dawn is always sad about someones deathand i dont think we know anything about how the battle at the tower of joy played out just that it was 7 vs 3 and only ned and howland came out alive"

"Abaddon",2011-05-13,"if they were to do this i dont think they have personally they could shoot a fairly extensive scene or set of scenes once in season one then take just snippets of it only do the fxpost for snippets as they use them and have those bits show up in different places in seasons 13 since everyone in the scene except for howland reed and ned is dead before the series starts and ned is dead after the 1st season it seems like the only complication would be howland reed who doesnt show up until well we dont know although if i recall correctly we do know hes going to show up at some point that one complication is a pretty big one though theyd have to risk having a guy they couldnt get again five or whatever years down the road or might not choose for the presumably bigger role in store for the character or recast him which would be cheesy and undermine the impact of the sequence"
"walrus",2011-05-13,"i would be very disappointed if they left the tower of joy out entirely honestly though id prefer to see it portrayed as it was in the books with just the prefight dialog onscreen and not the actual battle also if they portrayed neds companions as they did in the book in the dream they were only shadows grey wraiths on horses made of mist they could basically blur them out and eliminate the need to actually cast howland reed yet"
"NW Deserter",2011-05-13,"honestly though id prefer to see it portrayed as it was in the books with just the prefight dialog onscreen and not the actual battledefinitely agree with this and it seems like it would make it a fairly easy scene to film have the infamous conversation nonow it ends shivers have ned draw his sword and run at them fade to black have a womans voice overlaid saying promise me and then have ned wake up suddenly that would be a great opener to episode 6 methinks"

"Greylander",2011-05-15,"lord varys you keep refer to leading from the front as stupid even a rudimentary knowledge of military history should tell you that many great generals lead from the front george washington was notorious for being out in front of his men with bullets whizzing all around him the relative merits of leading from the frontrear is something that has been discussed and debated in military circles for millenia and there is not definitive answersome things to understandleading from the front does not necessarily mean literally in the front but does generally mean being in or very near the thick of battlebattles can last for hours or days being in the front lines does not mean that you are hacking at the enemy every moment typically groups of men come together hack at each other for a while then separate regroup officers try to bring order encourage the men decide what to do next charge another group of enemies or brace themselves for an imminent charge this happens over and over becoming more chaotic as the day ensues for a general leading from the front he will be surrounded by his elite unit going through this same process during lulls in fighting he will receive communications and send out orders by means of runners drummers trumpetersmorale in simple terms the willingness of the troops to stand an fight rather than run away is more important than both numbers and strategy and a general who leads from the front imparts a huge amount of courage to his men  they respect him possibly love him they will be ashamed to run when he is leading the charge so to speak a general who leads from the rear sacrifices these advantageseven from a hilltop or tower a general is not really going to have a good view of what is going on  the battlefield may be spread over a mile or more there can be other hills trees buildings dust smoke fog so the view is not all that much of an advantage the general in the rear will tend to have better information and be in a better position to make better tactical decisions but this is a matter of degree  as i note in the 2nd point above the general in front can still stay informed and give ordersbottom line there is nothing inherently stupid about leading from the front nor is there anything inherently cowardly about leading from the rear a good general first and foremost knows himself and knows his men and makes the decision to lead from front or rear accordingly and may even make a different decision from one battle tot he next or even through the course of a single battlegiven neds man who passes the sentence should swing the sword philosophy i seriously doubt that he would not lead from the front he would not expect men to take risks that he was not willing to take the overall attitude of the northmen strikes me that they would not respect or follow a leader who lead from the rear as for them it would be a sign of weakness"
