1	Ran	2011-05-29	What'd you think, folks? Poll opens right after the airing concludes.
2	RAddichio	2011-05-29	I gave ep 7 a 9...notice most people so far gave it an 8.  I'm not usually easy to please, so wonder why an 8 for tonight episode?
Plenty of time at The Wall, which made the man watching with me very happy -- those are his fav scenes.  Lord Baelish was brilliantly sinister as always and managed to surprise in the last few frames, even though I knew what to expect from him.  The actor is simply brilliant in that role..fits him like a glove.  As Drogo gave his Dothraki campaign speech we uttered "Vote for Me!"  /rolleyes2.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':rolleyes:' />
3	MusaYo	2011-05-29	I gave it a 9 also. I liked it more than the previous episode. I thought it kept the tension of what was happening and about to happen and loved the scene between Ned and Robert at the end. I will miss Mark Addy. I thought Drogo's scene was very well done, and appreciate Momoa's effort to learn Dothraki so that it sounds totally believable.

As Drogo gave his Dothraki campaign speech we uttered "Vote for Me!"  /rolleyes2.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':rolleyes:' />My opinions are the opposite...I absolutely loved Drogo in this episode, but am dislike Aiden Gillen more and more with every episode. Littlefinger is probably the biggest disappointment of the series for me. He's just flat and uninspired.I gave this episode a 7.5, leaning towards 7 though. I thought it was one of the weaker episodes so far (I actually gave 5 and 6 both 10/10). There were some high points for me, such as Jaime/Tywin, Drogo being a badass, Jorah and Dany, and hearing the NW oath...but everything else with average or a bit below the standards this series has set for itself. Robert's death in particular was way too emotioneless, and the Ros/<whore b> scene with LF was just dumb. I did appreciate Osha's scene with Luwin and Theon though.
5	CelticCail	2011-05-29	6, my lowest score yet.
6	Popgun	2011-05-29	10/10
Best episode to date for me. Night's watch vows and Drogo's speech were particular highlights.
7	Starkess	2011-05-29	Gave it an 8. Would have been a 9 if not for the awful LF-porn scene.
8	ExLibris	2011-05-29	I give it a 6...the worst episode to date.
The porn scene was really off putting and drawn out to the extreme...I don't mind throwing in some sex and nudity but ~5 minutes of pretty hardcore girl on girl sex is way over the top. Not to mention it totally overshadowed the importance of what Littlefinger was saying.
Tywin is a disappointment in his first appearance, and Robert's death was poorly done in my opinion. I don't think Ned even shed a tear or gave any indication that he was incredibly upset at the passing of his best friend. Thankfully the episode ended on an upswing as the final throne room scene was done well. I also enjoyed the Dothraki scenes (for once) and I think Khal Drogo finally stepped up and gave an excellent performance.
All in all, I hope the next episode is better and that the hardcore porn doesn't reappear.
9	Noir Dove	2011-05-29	People seem to be pretty split. I for one, loved it. The LF porn scene was most likely done for the sex bit, but, i could see past it. LF was talking and the actions of the girls was mirroring what he was doing to the realm. Something fake that seems... good.
But don't get me wrong, i TOTALLY understand why some would find it off putting and distracting, I'm just not one of them.
SOOO happy Jon is back, I love that man. Sam is brilliant.
Drogo was simply awesome, you could see how much anger he felt and the almost hysteric sound of his voice, it was just awesome.
Wish they'd put episode 8 up early /biggrin.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />
10	Bronn Stone	2011-05-30	Gave it an 8. Would have been a 9 if not for the awful LF-porn scene.That scene took it from an 11 to a 10 in my book.  I thought it was otherwise just about perfect.
11	Arrogant Bastard	2011-05-30	I gave it a 10, easily my favorite episode of the series so far. I did think the brothel scene was a bit over the top, but I still enjoyed Littlefinger's long speech, and I didn't think it was out of character for him either. Loved Charles Dance as Tywin, can't wait to see him interact with Tyrion, probably next week. Also enjoyed the Theon/Osha talk, and I really liked Maester Luwin's line "are the two mutually exclusive in your expereince?". The throne room scene at the end was probably my favorite scene in teh whole series up to this point. It really ratcheted up the tension and was practically identical to the scene in the book. My only complaint was Robert's death scene; I wish they showed Ned more
upset at his friend's passing and kept Robert's line about being with Lyanna.
12	elmis	2011-05-30	One of the best ones so far, a solid 10 if they had cut the Roz scene, actually, "play with her ass" should deduct two points but I gave it a 9 regardless. /smile.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
13	Lews	2011-05-30	People seem to be pretty split. I for one, loved it. The LF porn scene was most likely done for the sex bit, but, i could see past it. LF was talking and the actions of the girls was mirroring what he was doing to the realm. Something fake that seems... good.But don't get me wrong, i TOTALLY understand why some would find it off putting and distracting, I'm just not one of them.This. It may seem like it was just simple porn, and in a way it was, but at the same time it was a fantastic visual of LF's actions and excellent foreshadowing. I loved the episode. Tywin's introduction was great, in my opinion, and it was good to see more Jon. Not quite sure why they trimmed the Oath, but I didn't notice it while watching, so obviously not a bother. Great to get more from Drogo besides grunting and sex, too.My one complaint would be that there was no Arya, Tyrion, or much Varys. If only each episode was two hours long!
14	Daenerys	2011-05-30	Another solid 8 from me. Agree with others that the porn is just way too over the top, drawn out, and distracting. And also agree Robert's death was lacking resonance (and man am I going to miss Mark Addy, he was just fantastic from start to finish). Did love the mournful sound of the bells of Baelor in the background though.
One thing that seemed odd to me was Littlefinger actually holding a knife to Ned's throat. Was that really in the book? Seemed to out of character for me, Littlefinger is a guy who makes his living behind the scenes and disguising his loyalties. He schemes, but he's hands off when it comes to fighting. I think he'd feel that was not only beneath him but not wise to stick his neck out like that for all to see.
Well another very good episode overall that just missed the mark in a few places to keep it from touching me deeply. Missing Arya and Tyrion already /sad.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />

His smile was apologetic. "I did warn you not to trust me, you know."

16	John (Snow) Doe	2011-05-30	8
Very enjoyable - whole episode went down pretty much as I expected.  Only reason I can't give a 9-10 is for lack of innovation/surprise.
17	Imp	2011-05-30	Last week I gave a 9. This week got an 8 purely on the basis of the littlefinger exposition / lesbian sex scene. Way way over the top.
18	Ealdorman Halasahr	2011-05-30	I gave it a 7 out of 10. I think the scene in the brothel was a unworthy of GRRM:s writing. Done in some/any other way, perhaps, and still including the Littlefinger speech, the episode might have gotten 8 out of 10, but not now. Not ever.
And why is Lord Tywin butchering an animal in his pavilion? Shouldn't some of his servants be doing just that? Nice hard acting, though, by Charles Dance. I'm glad Tywin Lannister isn't my father.
19	Decius	2011-05-30	I think the scene in the brothel was a unworthy of GRRM:s writing. Really, because the GRRM I remembers has lots and lots of similar sex scenes. /wink.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />And why is Lord Tywin butchering an animal in his pavilion? Shouldn't some of his servants be doing just that?Many hunters are very peculiar about their prey. And the symbolism was very nice.Flatout 10 for me by the way, despite the clumsy sexposition scene (which - as said - is quite in GRRM's spirit).
20	Loras	2011-05-30	I gave this episode a 9.  
Mark Addy was brilliant as Robert, his final scene really stole the show for me.  There is so much depth to the friendship between Eddard and Robert and I got it in that scene.  It was excellent.  I enjoyed his interaction with Joff too, which was all too rare in the book.  Addy's performance had such a strong sense of regret to it.  
Also outstanding was the writing for Cersei, Headey has impressed me in nearly every scene and this week was no different.  The confrontation in the Gods Wood was beautifully done, she really captured the Cersei from the novels in that moment.  As well as the scene in the Throne room, which was wonderfully executed, that is until it came to the action section where the whole thing went a bit flat.
Props too to the actors behind Ser Barristan and Renly, excellent work in their scenes.  
The downside for me in this episode was the scenes set at the Wall - particularly the Night's Watch vows.  I found them to be flat and very monotone, when reading the books I found the vows stirring and inspiring, though there was none of that here.
21	WightWolf	2011-05-30	And why is Lord Tywin butchering an animal in his pavilion? Shouldn't some of his servants be doing just that? Nice hard acting, though, by Charles Dance. I'm glad Tywin Lannister isn't my father.

I like that he butchered the animal (a stag btw, like he was ripping the guts right out of the house of baratheon).  shows that he chose to butcher the animal.  obviously he could have had it done, but he chose it.  seven hells, he has a chest of drawers in his tent!
gave it an 8.  littlefinger scene was over the top.  mormont is underrated as a character and his importance to the story.
22	julandro	2011-05-30	I'm a little disappointed. For those who know me a little, as you can imagine what happens to me. The series has not shown a scene of Lancel Lannister and her cousin Cersei.
23	NW Deserter	2011-05-30	I'm a little disappointed. For those who know me a little, as you can imagine what happens to me. The series has not shown a scene of Lancel Lannister and her cousin Cersei. /rolleyes2.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':rolleyes:' /> That's not even revealed until book 2. They need to show Lancel turning haughty and arrogant first. His and Tyrion's scene where he gets the truth out of him is a good one, no need to ruin it early.
24	NW Deserter	2011-05-30	mormont is underrated as a character and his importance to the story.Which one? I'm loving both, myself, though we haven't gotten a lot of the Old Bear yet. Jorah's being portrayed perfectly though.

His and Tyrion's scene where he gets the truth out of him is a good one, no need to ruin it early.You are right, but several people told me they had shared a scene. It is possible that the creators have put the scissors in the mounting.
26	Carldog	2011-05-30	We are all die hard fans of asoiaf, but at times our emotions can get in the way of what is really going on.  Thus, I feel, this forum lacks brutal honesty.  People that see the truth are calling out the show, while others are saying its "the best one yet" or "excellent" or "a 10".  The fact is this ep was none of those.  It was good, not great, and I don't see how a view could be subjective.  
Ex:
The porn shot- I like chicks, but we all know what's going on there.
Robberts death-  "I guess the king died"' lacked emotion.
Tywin and the stag- poorly done when put in context of the book.
Drogo- here I come WWE!
In conclusion, this ep was much like the seires, up and down, hit and miss, a roller coster...you get the point.

It was a pretty damn good episode, and if people liked it that is their opinion. It IS subjective. How can their opinion on how much they liked the episode, which is what this generally boils down to, NOT be subjective? How was Tywin's scene poorly done? Why did you think Drogo's scene was bad? It seems you essentially threw out a bunch of opinions after saying it isn't something that can be subjective.
28	jellydonut	2011-05-30	Yeah, that's very subjective and personal. Here's how I see it; you have your opinion, others have theirs. There's nothing that says one is more valid or more 'true' than the other. I don't see how you can come out and say that you 'see the truth' while others are just baaah'ing along. It's your opinion, and it's worth just as much as anyone else's. :/
Anyway, I disagree - I think the only real low point of this episode was the Littlefinger whore scene. Sure, the producers may have felt that LF needed more exposition.. but why so long? and gratuitous? It might just be that I dislike the way they've made a non-book prostitute a recurring character that messes up our story lines. /tongue.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
It seems like they meant to include the subplot where Jon makes sure Sam ends up as Aemon's steward, going from his dialogue. 'I see Ser Alliser's revenge'.. Revenge for what? The scenes they filmed, that were left on the cutting floor in favor of Roz eating out another prostitute? /worried.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':worried:' />
I loved Charles Dance as Tywin, and I don't think dressing the stag was out of character. He's rich and powerful, but he's not a lofty lord who sits on pillows. He gets his hands dirty. Dressing his own kill illustrates that.. and the kill being a stag was a nice bit of symbolism. Well, at least I thought so. /unsure.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':unsure:' />

It can't truely be subjective if emotions are fueling your post, there needs to be separation, which the forum lacks when dealing with the show.
Tywin: how was it bad? How was it good, I ask?
Drogo: "I want you! Westeros, next Saterday night in the Madisen Square Garden!...."
Robert: that was not done well... FACT
Porn: "hey Joey, my mom and dad are gone. Look whats on TV," says the 15 year old to his friend.
31	Ealdorman Halasahr	2011-05-30	Really, because the GRRM I remembers has lots and lots of similar sex scenes. /wink.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />Nah, Martin's sex scenes are involving more pink masts than that, surely. Or a Lord's kiss. Not so many sleazy and utterly unnecessary, unmotivated scenes, just for the sake of nudity (or heterosexual male's ideas of lesbian sex workers' sex) itself.Many hunters are very peculiar about their prey. And the symbolism was very nice.I like that he butchered the animal (a stag btw, like he was ripping the guts right out of the house of baratheon).  shows that he chose to butcher the animal.  obviously he could have had it done, but he chose it.  seven hells, he has a chest of drawers in his tent!All right, I give you the obvious symbolism, that was rather ... symbolical. (I still wouldn't want Tywin Lannister as my father, though.)

32	NW Deserter	2011-05-30	Dude, you saying the scenes are bad - and claiming that it's actual fact - is the same as people calling this episode the best yet. In reality, none of the scenes are good or bad, and there's no way to prove their quality in either direction. It's fine if you don't like them but to say that we're ignoring "the facts" if we say we like them is a bit ridiculous.

33	Daenerys	2011-05-30	There's a lot of irony WRT the sex scenes. HBO likes to boast about how they have the "freedom" to show the explicit sex, full frontal nudity, male nudity, rape, incest, what have you (as well as violence like decapitating a horse or lingering on blood spurting from a guy's neck for 15 seconds). Yet at the same time they seem trapped and beholden by those same freedoms, the scenes becoming obligatory and shoehorned in whether they fit or not, or are necessary or not.
I'm disappointed that HBO doesn't have the guts to be better than Starz in this regard, where I expect it (Camelot). If they want to be the elite storytellers, they should be able to rely on that without forced gimmicks. Nothing wrong with a sex scene if it really makes sense, but it's getting ridiculous, it's like someone has a sex and violence checklist for each episode. Won't ruin Thrones for me, but it is distracting.

His facts say King Robert is very well done; his facts say he was ready to ride with Drogo; his facts say he learned a lot about Littlefinger in that brothel scene.I might get used to a world where opinion equals fact.I gave the episode a 9---(yes, it was the brothel scene that lowered)

Your husband must like pro wrestling.
Look, I never said it's not a good show, (Its my fav on tv) but you prove my point when I say we fan boys/girls can't truly make subjective post unless we strip all emotion.  That dosent happen here much; look at the rankings of each ep.  Not many votes below seven.
It reminds me of when Star Wars ep 1 came out. People where going nuts as they made their way out of theaters saying how great it was.  A few months later most were in tears.  
Remember fan is short for fanatic.
39	Dru	2011-05-30	I hate pro wrestling and thought the Drogo scene was well done. When I watch a series that I've read before hand, I'm pretty good at putting the book in the back of my head and watch the show for what it is. So far GoT is pretty amazing. Great cast. The sex scene was a little over the top in this episode but it did really show what kind of person LF really is. My wife is a didn't read the series and she is in love with the show. Take it for what it is and quit nitpicking the crap out of it. It's entertainment and pretty damn good to boot. I gave this episode a 9, sex scene did kinda spoil it.

LF was talking and the actions of the girls was mirroring what he was doing to the realm. Something fake that seems... good.I honestly don't think they included the scene for it's symbolic value.Some employees get 'danger money', the actress playing Roz should demand 'exposure money'. If she was remunerated per inch of skin per minute, she'd be one of the highest paid cast members.She must be a favourite of the costume department -"How will we dress her for the next scene?""I've got a nice bracelet and a piece of string here.""Great!"

Remember fan is short for fanatic.You should have quit when you were merely way behind.  Now you are approaching 'expressing irredeemably stupid opinions'  This thread has a ten point scale.  That scale isn't really defined, so each of us is applying our own definitions, all of which are equally valid.  I have chosen to define a 'ten' as 'in the top ten percent of all television shows ever produced'.  I don't see any logical flaw in giving this episode that rating.  So much of it was absolutely brilliant.  I can't see how anyone using my definition could rate it below seven.  But I don't whine at the 2's, because I know they are using different definitions.As best I can tell, your scale is "on a scale of one to ten, how much does this meet my fanwank expectations".  It isn't perfect.  In some cases it isn't what I would have done.  But they have captured the essence of the story, with the possible exception of the direwolves.  They didn't get Renly right.  But out of dozens of characters, he's the only one I think they got indefensibly wrong.  That is a well over 90% score in my book.  I am happy.
43	Holymoly	2011-05-31	Much backstory and character explanation going on in this episode. Theon and Tywin well done. Littlefinger less so. I don't have a problem with the gratuitous teen erotica however I do have a problem with Littlefinger being as frank and honest with a couple of cheap whores. Totally out of character, and not particularly well acted either. Props this week to Eddard, Tywin and Sam. They kept the episode going and provided the structure for the whole thing to hang together.
Hopefully the entire canon will be serialised in time, so long as GRRM actually finishes it. Only then will much of this episode fall in to place for many.
44	Asharak	2011-05-31	I gave the episode an 8.
It would have been a 10 if the sex scene hadnÂ<U+0092>t been there. I feel embarrassed on the producers behalf, it just felt childish and amateurish. It downgrades the material when they show a graphic 5 minute soft-core sex scene, in a show that is usually pretty grown up.
It doesnÂ<U+0092>t make the show feel more adult, 
It makes it feel like it was made for 13 year olds.
45	Popgun	2011-05-31	Drogo's speech was like WWE wrestling.... *facepalm* like WTF? How a WWE comparison came up I'll never know. You must be real smart Carldog to think Game of Thrones is like pro wrestling. I guess everyone else is too "emotional" and couldn't connect the dots.... thanks for pointing that one out champ.
46	valacirca	2011-05-31	Actually it was WWE'ish in some parts. That's not to say it was bad. I loved that part.

48	Adam Bodestyne	2011-05-31	.. but you prove my point when I say we fan boys/girls can't truly make subjective post unless we strip all emotion.I cannot help but think you are perhaps confusing the words 'subjective' (based upon subjective feelings or intuition, not upon observation or reasoning) and 'objective' (not influenced by emotion).'Objective' is probably the word you meant..?
49	valacirca	2011-05-31	I'm not a pro wrestling fan to be honest, but I'm pretty sure it's never featured a guy talking in dothraki describing how he is going to cross the narrow sea with 40,000 men and horses to conquer the lands.Considering the personas that have been introduced into pro wrestling through the years, that description could very easily be made into a pro-wrestling character.
50	SerArthurHeath	2011-05-31	What I'm saying is remove the emotional attachment and judge it that way.  It's very hard to do; most posters can't.  It can't truely be subjective if emotions are fueling your post, there needs to be separation, which the forum lacks when dealing with the show.Tywin: how was it bad? How was it good, I ask?Drogo: "I want you! Westeros, next Saterday night in the Madisen Square Garden!...."Robert: that was not done well... FACTPorn: "hey Joey, my mom and dad are gone. Look whats on TV," says the 15 year old to his friend.Um, there's no way you can dissociate yourself from a show emotionally part way through it, unless you didn't make those attachments initially. And your not meant to emotionally dissociate yourself from the show- that would remove the value of trying to create emotional attachment and empathy with characters in the first place, and you may as well just show plot and no character development.

51	Lany Cassandra	2011-05-31	Lany:Your husband must like pro wrestling.Look, I never said it's not a good show, (Its my fav on tv) but you prove my point when I say we fan boys/girls can't truly make subjective post unless we strip all emotion.  That dosent happen here much; look at the rankings of each ep.  Not many votes below seven.It reminds me of when Star Wars ep 1 came out. People where going nuts as they made their way out of theaters saying how great it was.  A few months later most were in tears.  Remember fan is short for fanatic.He hates pro wrestlings and has never watched it.  Your point was we are too much emotionally envolved----my husband had no emotional attachment, loves it, and so you insult him with the wrestling comment.Your opinion does not equal fact.
52	ViennaGirl	2011-05-31	I give it an 8 - wish the whole NW vow was included but loved the creepy heart tree.  The sex scene was disproportionately long, but if it brings viewers and keeps the show going, ok.  I'm not a huge Daenerys fan in the books, but I'm starting to like her in the show, which is good, because I know she's the it girl.  My heart is breaking for Ned...I wanted him to take Renly up on his offer and change the storyline (not really.  but.)  Tywin skinning his own deer - really?  In a tent?  Yuck.
Would love more more more Jon, more Arya, more more more!  Did I mention that I would love more Jon?
53	Abaddon	2011-05-31	She must be a favourite of the costume department -"How will we dress her for the next scene?""I've got a nice bracelet and a piece of string here.""Great!"Now that was funny.  /thumbsup.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':thumbsup:' />
54	Greywolf2375	2011-05-31	Gave it an 8. Would have been a 9 if not for the awful LF-porn scene.What she said as well as the changes to Tywin being detractors.
55	Nnorb	2011-05-31	I'm not a pro wrestling fan to be honest, but I'm pretty sure it's never featured a guy talking in dothraki describing how he is going to cross the narrow sea with 40,000 men and horses to conquer the lands.Clearly you aren't familiar with some of John Cena's more inventive metaphors. Rating the individual episodes seems somewhat odd to me, as much of their impact depends on what comes before and after. I know it's not the same, but do we rate individual chapters of a book?9/10, for what it's worth. The 2nd best television series I've ever watched. Would probably be number one if I hadn't read the books.
56	The Night's Watch	2011-05-31	Thought the episode was good except for Tywin. Not how i imagined him at all.
The highlight was Drogo's speech.
57	Carldog	2011-05-31	Popgun,
To quote Gus from Lonesome Dove, "your in over your head, Pea."
To quote Walter from Big Lebowski "your out of your element, Donny!"
58	Carldog	2011-05-31	Lany,
We, the readers, not your husband, the non reader, must separate emotions.
How eles can I put it?
59	Lany Cassandra	2011-05-31	Lany,We, the readers, not your husband, the non reader, must separate emotions.How eles can I put it?I know that is what you meant.  I am very emotional about it, so I shared my husbands feelings on it.  He likes it a great deal, and you still discounted his opinion and insulted him.  You think yours is the only viable opinion. There are no misunderstandings here.
60	Carldog	2011-05-31	Lany,
Yes there are misunderstandings.  I never insulted him or discredited him.  I made a joke about my own comment; the Drogo secne had a WWE feel to it, he said he liked it, I said he must like WWE.  It's a joke.
As for my opinions; they are not the only viable ones on the board, but they are made without an emotional attachment.
You admit emotion in your last post which creates bias messaging.  It goes back to my original statement of inflated ep rankings.
 who cares about what I have to say? Im one dude.
61	tarantella	2011-05-31	I'd give this one an 8.  Tywin definitely fits the hardass patriarch bill really well and I thought they got the relationship between him and Jaime down in that scene.  The Dany scenes were also pretty good, especially now that we're seeing how Jorah is conflicted.  And I couldn't stop cringing at almost every single thing Ned Stark did or said this episode.
I still think they're getting Renly wrong.  He seems way too halting and hesitant.  In the book he was a flashy, slightly arrogant guy, I imagine usually with a rakish grin.  Granted he had to be serious this episode, but still.  I don't know how they're going to pull off that scene between him and Stannis in season two at this rate.  
And Littlefinger telling those whores all about his ambitions and his love for Catelyn... ehh.  The whole thing felt wrong, it didn't seem characteristic of Littlefinger at all and it overstayed its welcome.  I have absolutely no problem with those kinds of scenes, but this one felt jammed in.  For lack of a better word.

62	The Anti-Targ	2011-05-31	Would have been a 9 but for Ros' training day scene. Which put it back to an 8.
63	YoDaddy	2011-05-31	Had to go with a 6. I love lesbian sex as much as the next guy, but this scene had ZERO place in the show. What is it with these writers? When a guy like me thinks there's too much sex and nudity in a show, you have a serious problem.
 I could pick it apart even further, but that is just the fanboy in me being dissapointed that it is not following the book more.
64	Eve	2011-05-31	Gave it an 8. Would have been a 9 if not for the awful LF-porn scene.That was exactly why I gave it an 8 as well.  I am all for the sex scenes, but that was just unnecessary and distracting. I almost gave it a 7, but at least we saw Ghost this episode.
65	Bannerman	2011-05-31	I'm disappointed in the cliffhanger ending. And "Tommy Carchetti" is a poor casting choice for Littlefinger. So many casting choices are on the money though that I shouldn't quibble. /smile.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
66	Dalan	2011-05-31	Lany,Yes there are misunderstandings.  I never insulted him or discredited him.

Im one dude.As much as I loathe to get involved in this I fear I am unable to resist.Just because you believe your opinions lack emotions do not make it so.  To not admit your own emotional influences in your opinions is an insidious and dangerous conceit.  Every human opinion has emotion.  It is impossible for a human being to separate opinion from emotion.  To deny that your emotion influences your opinions or rationales could in time lead you to a belief of moral superiority over others due to your believe that other's opinions are swayed by emotions while yours are (falsely) not.  I hope you in time come to realize that you do not have a monopoly on what it means to be unemotional or biased.I also hope you understand how awesomely epic that previous paragraph was, especially posted on a thread dedicated to rating a television episode of a series based on the first book of a fantasy series.Back on to what really matters, my opinion:  I gave this episode a 7.  So the series stands as 1:9/2:8/3:10/4:9/5:9/6:8/7:7Going a bit downhill the last few, but perhaps it is just my expectations that are going up.  And I really want to see the Tower of Joy.

70	mimi	2011-06-01	I gave episode7 a '9'. Thought it was really good. I will miss Mark Addy!!!2 things:The king's death and the vows and ending would've packed a lot more emotion if there was even a little appropriate music! I'm so surprised at how little music there is in each episode.  Those scenes could be SO dramatic, yet they were so quiet that it didn't quite make it....to me. Love the opening theme and wish they would apply it more.AND, I'm sorry but Aiden(?) is just really flat, to me. Littlefinger is an important role and he's not the part at all. He looks the part, but his lines are almost robotic.LOVE the wall!
71	Swordfish	2011-06-01	That was exactly why I gave it an 8 as well.  I am all for the sex scenes, but that was just unnecessary and distracting. I almost gave it a 7, but at least we saw Ghost this episode.We also heard him bark.So it gets a five from me.
72	Ealdorman Halasahr	2011-06-01	Thought the episode was good except for Tywin. Not how i imagined him at all.The highlight was Drogo's speech.I kind of liked Charles Dance's take on Tywin Lannister. Not bad at all. Hopefully you'll like him better in the future episodes.By the way, welcome to the board! Enjoy your time here /rofl2.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':rofl:' />
73	oneeye	2011-06-01	I have been giving 10's. I mean compared to the book, we could argue, but compared to other TV shows, especially non HBO/showtime/AMC crap on CBS or FOX, 10 is easily the only option.
74	Songlian	2011-06-01	7 again for me, made from 9 and 6 scenes.  
Tywin Lannister was definitely a 9, he made the episode for me and the skinning of the stag was so much like him, it was amazing. I'm very pleased with the casting and the acting for him. The same with Osha, the Night's Watch Vow (would have been a ten if they hadn't cut down the words), every scene with Ned, especially those at the end and (probably) the final one with Robert. Mark Addy was simply great in this show, and as far as I'm concerned, he will be missed. 
Moving into 6 territory: Ros and Littlefinger... what was that, I don't even. Contrary to the popular belief, I found Drogo's speech hilarious, especially when he got to boast about raping the women and such.  Another part that should have been dramatic for me but ended up being hilarious was when the rider-less horse gets back from beyond the wall, and Jon asks all pouty "Where is my uncle?", like everyone knew but wouldn't tell him. And I'm not exactly sure what that scenes was supposed to bring that we didn't knew already.  
And I just have to mention Dany and Sam, who are so great with their performances, they're making me like their characters in the books as well. /smile.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
75	Former Lord of Winterfell	2011-06-01	6 for me, two points lower than I'd give any other Ep.The LF sex scene was just bizarre.  From the general reaction, I doubt it will have the intended effect of attracting more viewers. My wife -- who has a good porn collection and actually sells sex toys -- has signed off from the show because of that.  And -1 because Littlefinger himself is just such a disappointment.  Like the bad guy in some Wall Street movie rather than in a medieval setting.I thought Tywin was great, but the idea of dressing an animal in your tent was just wacky.  You might skin inside, but you'd never gut inside and just dump the entrails inside a tent.  Particularly in good weather.  That struck me as strange. For that matter, you generally gut the same time/place you bleed it.The rest was great, though.
76	Eve	2011-06-01	We also heard him bark.So it gets a five from me./biggrin.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />  I wonder why they kept the bark.  It did make me laugh out loud, but at least they remembered that the wolves were in the books.
77	King-Slayer	2011-06-02	The porn scene was really off putting and drawn out to the extreme...I don't mind throwing in some sex and nudity but ~5 minutes of pretty hardcore girl on girl sex is way over the top. Not to mention it totally overshadowed the importance of what Littlefinger was saying.Tywin is a disappointment in his first appearance, I would give it a 7. I agree, over the top. The Littlefinger scene is the worst in the series for me. So annoying, trying to hear the story. I had to rewind to listen to it again. I liked Tywin though, but not the gutting of the animal. I suppose they wanted to add the symbolism and have something going on instead of just a conversation.  Someone said Jaime and his father had this conversation in the book. I don't remember reading it. I'll flip through and try to find it.
78	Tywin's bastard	2011-06-02	We also heard him bark.So it gets a five from me.We already knew Ghost isn't mute in the show though since he snarled in the scene where they scare Rast.

79	Gurney Halleck	2011-06-02	On par with the other episodes so far this season. Just.
Yes, I'm all for juicy book moments and exposition of plot. This epi had lots of both, but I don't think it was portrayed as well as in previous shows. Yes, I agree the littlefinger brothel scene was a bit nutty, "play with her arse" - did anybody else realise how quick and done that line was, over before it began? it may look on paper but I think the actors were a bit "I know this is HBO but REALLY?" don't get me wrong, love arty sex but this was distracting from the lines LF gives.
Ros, make more time for Sansa and the Hound. Will you kindly?
Yeah, lack of direwolves is crap, but at least we have them looking awesome and real before they become huge and CG!

But that doesn't make it better.  There's just no reason for it.  The fact that he's mute is not a throwaway detail, and making him bark and growl serves no useful purpose and detracts meaningfully from the story.  It's just a really bizarre decision.

The fact that he's mute is not a throwaway detail, and making him bark and growl serves no useful purpose and detracts meaningfully from the story.  It's just a really bizarre decision.It depends on how you see it. Ghost being mute has no significance to the plot, it's just a descriptive thing and you'd have to explain it will look odd with a wolf rearing his teeth but not making any sound. When I think about it Ghost makes noises as a pup when they find him as well so that part was removed early.All in all it's one of the details that I feel would be nice to have in the show (if it was possible we'd of course want everything to be in there) but I'm not too bothered by it being left out, seeing how a lot of things will be lost in the transition.
82	Swordfish	2011-06-02	It depends on how you see it. Ghost being mute has no significance to the plot, it's just a descriptive thing We'll just have to agree to disagree here.Following that same logic, couldn't you say that tyrion being a little person is just a descriptive thing, and has no significance to the plot?  It's a fundamental trait of the character.  The kind of thing that adds depth.  It's a big part of the reason he's even named ghost!what purpose does making him bark serve to advance the plot?  none.it's just something that I think is really strange.

83	tarantella	2011-06-02	I noticed a lot of people disagree about how Tywin comes off in this episode, whether his portrayal here matches up with that of book Tywin.  Maybe it's just me, but I never felt like I got a very good impression of Tywin's character from the books.  Almost all of what we know about him we hear from other characters, and he is talked about a lot throughout the series.  But we don't get very many scenes with him actually present, and it's hard to say what exactly is going on in his head sometimes.
I'm not familiar with anything else Charles Dance has done, but I liked the way he played Tywin in ep 7. It was a good introduction to this ruthless patriarch and his relationship with his sons.  And he's got the icy stare down.

It's a big part of the reason he's even named ghost!what purpose does making him bark serve to advance the plot?  none.it's just something that I think is really strange.Tyrion being a dwarf has a ton of impact on the character. That's the main reason he's become the man that he is, because he's a dwarf before he's a human in everyone's eyes. Had he been a full grown man and still as clever Tywin would probably have been pleased that Jaime couldn't inherit Casterly Rock because Tyrion would be the new Tywin (and with that background he most likely wouldn't have developed his compassion). So in short Tyrion would be a completely different person.Ghost on the other hand is mainly Jon's property and serves to enhance him, rather than being an important character in himself. Ghosts are generally white (and not always silent) so there's hardly any problems with the name. Ghost can still be scary, be fiercely loyal to Jon and be an outsider of his litter while being able to make sounds, and that pretty much sums him up.And the point isn't that him making sounds advances the plot, it's that they don't have to go in and edit the sound of the scenes he's in. They probably felt that the trait wasn't important enough to put aside editing time for that instead of something else (me guessing).

86	Tywin's bastard	2011-06-02	Huh?  It's a work of fiction.  He would've been whatever person george wanted him to be, and that includes a taller version of himself.You'd have to have very low opinions of a writer to think that he would have a character being looked down upon by pretty much everyone without giving any reason for why, because that's just terrible writing. There's a very clear causality between Tyrion being born a dwarf and how he is as a person. It's at the core of him and George is a good enough writer to have written everything about Tyrion as a logical step from that core. If you remove that you don't have any reason for why he is who he is.In order to keep him what he is you'd need something else to explain it, and changing isn't the same as removing and therefor has nothing to do with what we're talking about.I don't want to get into a big back and forth over this, but that makes zero sense.  These are trained animals, then bark and growl when you tell them to bark and growl.hell, the bark in the scene coming out from under the wall was clearly edited IN.So this theory that it's just easier because of editing reasons simply holds no water.Either way, like i said, I'm content to simply agree to disagree.We can certainly agree to disagree. I think you chose the less interesting part of what I wrote about Ghost to comment on though since my part about his "character" had more meat on it, seeing how I didn't have to take a random guess.

Love the opening theme and wish they would apply it [/quote]I agree with this. I have collected film music all my life and the scoring of this is one of my only serious disappointments in the series.  Like you, I do love the opening theme, which is the only reason I will buy this score, but the rest does nothing for the series.  It isn't really scored. Just some undertone mood bits here and there to indicate tension or spookiness.  Some of the scenes like Robert's death would indeed have carried more weight had the score told us a little of what a man like Ned could not say.  I am not talking Korngold grandness or anything here...just more than what we get.  Nothing unites the story as a great score can.I liked the episode.   I am stingy with a 10...haven't seen that yet... But maybe an 8.  Like so many, I was so annoyed with the brothel scene.  Just childish in an otherwise adult series.  I actually like the actress who plays Roz, but give her a rest!  I am so time conscious When  I watch this show because every minute counts and when she hogs up a full five minutes, more than so many important characters like Sansa-and the Hound, I just get really annoyed.  And just can't see Littlefinger spilling his guts to a couple of whores.If Martin gives her a major scene next week, I surrender.      Loved Tywin and Jamie.  Very strong impression from Dance, even though I saw him differently in the books.  And I loved the nuances and responses from Jaime... A layered character being well developed, even if I do wish we had seen more of the reckless, supposedly careless side of his flamboyant personality.  He may be a little too troubled at this point, so that his story arc will be a little less surprising for viewers than it was fro readers.Glad to see real affection between Dany and Drogo so that Dany's imminent actions make sense.I never liked Cersei coming on to Ned in the books, so I liked their scene fine and I really enjoyed her in the throne room scene...soft voiced and haughty.I agree with whoever said that it might have helped to understand Ned's actions towards Cersei's children had we understood what happened to Rhaegar's, but heck, sacrificing important story line (I am also thinking ToJ here) for all that girl on girl sex sure seems an intelligent call!Still...I love the show.

He identifies with Jon the bastard and Bran the cripple.  I love his conversation with Jon early in the book("Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forgot what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armour. And it can never be used to hurt you.") When Jon saw Jaime, he thought he looked like a King and felt bad for Tyrion. Then after the conversation with Tyrion, saw him as the King:Loved this part of the book:          "Remember this boy, all dwarfs may be bastards , yet not all bastards need be  dwarfs." And with that he turned and sauntered back into the feast, whistling a tune. When he opened the door, the light from within threw his shadow clear across the yard, and for just a moment Tyrion Lannister stood tall as a King."

Overall series average - 8.3I'm a little surprised, actually, because this episode was very good for the most part. But I think the Littlefinger scene really hurt episode 7, it gets an almost universal strong negative reaction (from reviewers on the forums, bloggers, and print, it doesn't matter). I personally ranked it down a point just for that, it really was that bad and that distracting. If I had recommended to a friend or family member they watch the show and they saw this episode, frankly I would be embarrassed, and they probably would have stopped watching right there. Hopefully HBO learns a lesson from this. This show is good enough to stand on the strength of the story and the acting, it doesn't need gimmicks.

91	Bloodymummer	2011-06-02	I would have given this a 9, but HBO has to be HBO and give us a pointless sex scene during LF's monologue.  Dear HBO - people can spank it to much better scenes than what you can up with.  Otherwise, thought it was great.
7/10
92	arrowfan	2011-06-03	8/10.  Only thing holding this ep back from being one of the best was that ludicrous scene with Littlefinger and the whores.  Wtf?  Oh well.  
The scenes at the wall continue to steal the series for me.  They've gotten just about everything spot on there. 
The scenes at KL were good and dramatic.  And of course, great ending to this ep!
93	arrowfan	2011-06-03	Oh first ep without Tyrion? I know he's not in theses scenes but I missed him all the same.
Agree with most here - the scene with Tywin and Jaime was well done.

I genuinely laughed out loud when I read that. Personally I quite liked the scene and thought it was a good way to demonstrate Littlefinger's true character.But yeah, I get your point of recommending the series to friends or family and then they get greeted with a 5 minute lesbian sex scene. I watched it at home with my wife so no problemo. It mortifies me though to think what would have happened if I were visiting my parents at the time. I would have said, "Hey there's a great series I'm into on t.v.... mind if we watch it?" My parents would say sure and ask if it's good etc.... I'd be like "yeah it's awesome. It's based on the best book series I've ever read and the show is my fave series on t.v at the moment." My parents would enthusiastically agree and change the channel to HBO. Uh oh.... two naked woman having loud sex for five minutes.... I would be beyond embarrassed. Even writing that theoretical scenario makes me cringe in embarrassment. Thank heaven I wasn't visiting my parents that night lol

This show is good enough to stand on the strength of the story and the acting, it doesn't need gimmicks.A funny thing about that scene was that I talked with two non-reader viewers yesterday (separate occasion) and when we talked about the latest episode both mentioned the LF scene as the first thing when they mentioned things they liked. None of them had really even cared that there was sex in the scene, they felt all focus lied with LF. Funny how different opinions can be as much we've read here has been quite the opposite.Personally I don't see sex scenes with plot or character exposition as gimmicky anymore, an opinion I've had since I first saw Rome. Sex is natural, more so than violence. I find it more noticeable and jarring to my immersion when a show hides it in the stereotypical ways (bed cover covers the girl after sex, she somehow keeps her underwear on, furniture is conveniently in the line of sight etc) as being afraid of exposed sex and nudity is very apparent as there's a big double standard about that going around. I can still get embarrassed in some cases (like when watching sex scenes with my mother) but I'm working on it since getting embarrassed for that makes me feel silly.

96	jellydonut	2011-06-03	Music?!Are you guys kidding me?This is why I watch HBO. Watch 'The Wire'. The only music is the music that is in the environment.Granted, GoT has a little more, but not a lot. That's a GOOD THING. Music rarely adds to a scene. If a producer needs music to hammer into his viewers' heads that 'LISTEN THIS SCENE IS TOTALLY DRAMATIC' he has failed.
97	Ealdorman Halasahr	2011-06-03	Not just any animal...a stag.  I loved this scene.  Jaime did a great job at being "unnerved", and Tywin at being "unnerving."  A+!Yeah, I know about the symbolical (Baratheon)stag - now. (I think I've already commented on that, though. Earlier, that is - but you're completely correct, none the less.)And yes, I think Mr. Dance is an excellent Tywin thus far. Let's see if he's performance is a good in later episodes (and why not?).
98	LadyT	2011-06-03	Music?!Are you guys kidding me?This is why I watch HBO. Watch 'The Wire'. The only music is the music that is in the environment.Granted, GoT has a little more, but not a lot. That's a GOOD THING. Music rarely adds to a scene. If a producer needs music to hammer into his viewers' heads that 'LISTEN THIS SCENE IS TOTALLY DRAMATIC' he has failed.Don't want to duel over this here, but...Film is an art form that has used music since it's inception. Most great directors both use it and defend it, despite the fact that the music comes from nowhere.Guess they all failed.GoT could have been filmed without music and I could live with that just fine.  But since it is scored, I just wish it had been done better.
99	Daenerys	2011-06-03	Personally I don't see sex scenes with plot or character exposition as gimmicky anymore, an opinion I've had since I first saw Rome. Sex is natural, more so than violence. I find it more noticeable and jarring to my immersion when a show hides it in the stereotypical ways (bed cover covers the girl after sex, she somehow keeps her underwear on, furniture is conveniently in the line of sight etc) as being afraid of exposed sex and nudity is very apparent as there's a big double standard about that going around. I can still get embarrassed in some cases (like when watching sex scenes with my mother) but I'm working on it since getting embarrassed for that makes me feel silly.In general I agree with this sentiment, I just thought this particular scene went way over the line and became distracting. Some of the Dany-Drogo, Cersei-Jaime, or Theon-Ros sex scenes didn't bother me, there was a reason for them. The scene with Viserys and Doreah in the tub didn't bother me at all. Technically, they didn't have to be naked or engaged in sex to have that conversation, but it seemed natural.I did like what Littlefinger was saying in the scene, it is good character information for him, it was just hard to concentrate and absorb that with "play with her ass" sprinkled into the dialogue. I also don't like how Littlefinger is pretty much being portrayed as a straight up pimp in the tv series. From the books I got the idea he has his hands into lots of things and one small part of that had to do with owning some whorehouses. And he does it not just for the revenue, but because of the information he can gain through that (what he really makes his living on). But in the tv series it seems like that's all he does except sit in on the occasional small council meeting.Anyway, it's not a big deal, doesn't ruin the series for me, I just think they are getting caught in the trap of having to show obligatory sex scenes whether they make sense or not. Which makes it feel cheapened, like Starz instead of HBO.
100	sammycakes	2011-06-03	Voted an 8 though I'd have preferred to give it a 7.5. I hated the LF sexposition scene. I thought the writing was clumsy and clumsily delivered by Gillen (you'd think he'd be much better at monologuing after The Wire). Porn star-ishness of the whores is really distracting; I can't imagine whores actually looking/acting like that in Westeros. And while the Khal's speech was fine, I'm annoyed that every Essos scene looks like it was cast and filmed at Burning Man. Vaes Dothrak and Dothraki culture looks smooth and cartoonish when it should be rough-hewn and raw.
That said, I thought the opening Tywin scene was wonderful, and the economy of plotting continues to impress me.
101	Lokhtar	2011-06-04	My problem with the series is that the show follows too closely to the novel.  What works on the page doesn't necessarily work on the screen.  The two best scenes in the series so far were the Cercei/Robert scene and the Tywin/Jaime scene - neither of which was in the book.  The Littlefinger scene would have been a third if it wasn't for the over the top lesbain action going on at the same time.   If they kind of let themselves be inspired by the book and follow the plot from it rather than following page by page dialogue, it'd be a much better series.
102	Rhaego Dragon	2011-06-04	If they would do so then there would be also people who would be saying they are doing a bad job because they do not follow what is written in the book.
I also think that the scenes you mantioned were great. It great that the series can offer scenes that are not written down in the books, but which show us much of the background. eg littlefingers love for catelyn, cersei-robert problems, tywins relationship to jaime and so on. I just think that the mix of following the book and doing such improvised scenes is important. And in my opinion they have done an excellent job till now.
103	Lokhtar	2011-06-04	Well of course there would.  THere were fans who didn't watch LOTR because it didn't follow the books as closely as they'd have liked.  But it was a successful adaptation nonetheless.  You can't take a book and just put it on screen - it's a different medium.  And especially if its a book which was written PRECISELY because the author was tired of the limitations that TV/Movies imposed.  It doesn't make sense to force it.
104	Lokhtar	2011-06-04	Also, forgot to mention: 
Charles Dance = Fucking Epic.  It was almost embarrassing how good he was in that one scene.  The whole Jaime arrogant bravado destroyed in one perfect line "Go on, say something clever."
105	King-Slayer	2011-06-04	Don't want to duel over this here, but...Film is an art form that has used music since it's inception. Most great directors both use it and defend it, despite the fact that the music comes from nowhere.Guess they all failed.GoT could have been filmed without music and I could live with that just fine.  But since it is scored, I just wish it had been done better.I don't want to duel about the music thing either, but wanted to add me two cents.. I agree with you, music is important for film. It brings out emotion.Just to stress that point,  I remember one of my teachers had us watching a horror film without the music.  it wasn't as scary.
106	Daenerys	2011-06-04	If they would do so then there would be also people who would be saying they are doing a bad job because they do not follow what is written in the book.True, but I wouldn't worry about that, 95%+ of the book's fans are going to continue watching/subscribing regardless (unless it's really, really horrible, which is not likely given the talented cast and crew). I agree with Lokhtar that diverging even more while maintaining a base of the spirit of the books would not necessarily be a bad thing. I'm not saying change basic plot points like who lives or dies, or the basic nature of the characters, but adding additional characterization scenes and cutting out some clunky dialogue or even whole scenes that don't work as well on screen would be fine. I would even cut some entire characters and locations (for example perhaps Euron and Victarion) to keep the pace moving better and allow more time for main characters. I'd also shift around a lot of the timeline to give a better flow and not have characters disappear for long stretches (sometimes entire books). The POV nature of the books demands some changes as it is, but I'd go even further. You can see in the Harry Potter movies where slavish devotion to the written page has bad consequences.
107	Chelly	2012-01-31	Great episode! The Jaime and Tywin scene was another addition on the show I enjoyed very much. It really set the mood for the Lannister and what they are about. Charles Dance plays Tywin perfectly.
108	Nakraal	2012-04-27	How come sir Barristan just follows the orders of the Queen when he has just read that King Robert gave Ned the regency?
Is her word ("we have a new king now") more valid than the kings will???
Why did he just sat watching the gold cloaks perform something that in his eyes should seem like a coup?
109	Stannis1991	2013-09-08	I know it's been long since someone commented on this episode, but this one is one of my favourites. Backstabbing and betrayels, and very intense episode. I rated it 9, but I could have gone all the way to 10, but I chose not to.

I like the setting/genre and have no expectations.  I remember back to BABYLON 5 and its intricate story arc.  I didn't like it in its first year but it was amazing. Poor ratings made it get cut short and almost not get finished. But JMS had the story in his head - I just hope the author here has a n-year storyline worked out.  Hope it sticks around.

Hope it sticks around.Nice to hear from someone who hasn't read the books.  I'm probably not alone in being curious as to what others in your position think of the series.And don't feel bad about not remembering some of the names.  The books had appendices outlining who was who and in what house, etc., to help us along.  I know I referred to them continually during my read(s) of the series.Now, on to the Ned questions.  Ned didn't tell Robert about his son on his deathbed in a misguided attempt to ease the man's passing, IIRC.  He felt it would have been the utmost in cruelty to drop that particular bombshell on him as the man was done for at that point.  Yeah, to us it's a pretty stupid move, but Ned's not really known for doing the clever thing, more the honorable thing.And, really, what would it have mattered at that point?Who would they have kept in the room as witnesses and why couldn't the witness have been disposed of by the queen?  As for why bother warning Cersei, that's just another example of our guy being the nice guy who finishes last.  He's obviously misjudging the situation.

121	legba11	2011-05-30	Most episodes (like many great shows) have an underlying theme which unfies the disparate stories.  The best example of this was Ep5 which was the inadequecy of younger brothers who weren't raised to be leaders.
This week's seemed a rather simple one, Robert's Failures.
He did not leave a proper heir, while he was the victim in this case, he is the King and the buck stops here.  Even with the deception aside, Joffery is clearly not a fit ruler.
Drogo was not going to invade, Robert pushed him into action with his clumsy action.  Again, you could lay the fault of this at the feet of Varys/Renly/LF but these are the men he chose to run his kingdom, he accepts responsibility for his failure.
Even on his deathbed, his unable to do things right.  He knew the transition to his son would be a challenging time.  Yet he chose to proclaim this to Ned privately. He should have made this proclamtion as public as possible.  He knows Ned's personal guard is too weak, yet he does nothing to ensure his final decree is followed.
And of course, his mortal wound.

That's what a good additional scene should do.
123	Songlian	2011-06-01	The addition of the Tywin scene was amazing in that it managed to cement and explain the character not only of Jaime and Tywin who are IN the scene, but also of Cersei and Tyrion who were nowhere NEAR the scene.  That's what a good additional scene should do.I agree.For me that scene cemented the Lannisters as (wannabe) lions among sheep, and it's all because of skinning that stag and Tywin's words. Very nicely done, one of my favorites so far.
124	Aemon Stark	2011-06-01	Tywin's scene was also an example of a rare improvement over the novel, where the character's first appearance is arguably a lot less dramatic. Loved it.

128	Knight Of The North	2011-06-04	Charles Dance's hair. It's slightly strange, but that stark mixture of grey and reddish blonde genuinely reminds me of an old Lion, with it's hair changing. It's coming to the end of it's reign, and it wants it's heir to be fitting. Really, it just added that little bit extra to the scene. Brilliant casting choice.
129	Astos	2011-06-12	Also, notice the animal Tywin is skinning the first time he appears. That can't be a coincidence.
130	Jojen	2011-06-10	I wanted to comment on LF's monologue, but since that particular thread is closed, I had to go ahead and start a new one. Hope that's alright?
Anyway, I wasn't crazy about that ep, but mainly I wanted to agree with those who thought Petyr's monologue was too on-the-nose if not totally unnecessary. I think it was also way too gratuitous, and I'm not just referring to the girl-on-girl action. For Petyr to tip his hand like that just seemed WAY out of character to me. This is a man who advises people not to trust him, and then he turns around and spills out his intentions to a couple of employees? What makes him think he can trust a pair of whores, of all people? Who's to say they don't whisper his secrets to their clients? If he was Euron, he'd have their tongues cut out before he'd even consider telling them anything personal about himself. 
It just seems wrong for him to trust anyone with such info. It pulls back the curtain too early, and makes him too obviously "the bad guy" too soon in the storyline.
Anyway, that's my tuppence.

132	CelticCail	2011-05-29	Eh.  Underwhelmed.  The last scene was good, but there was too much made up crap otherwise.
133	iheartseverus	2011-05-29	Oh, Ned,  my friend, why didn't you listen to Renly?  /worried.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':worried:' />
134	CelticCail	2011-05-29	I guess now that there's HBO Go, everyone's on the early thread and not on here anymore.  Oh well.
135	blasted_saber	2011-05-29	Eh.  Underwhelmed.  The last scene was good, but there was too much made up crap otherwise.I thought the Tywin scene was needed to move the storyline along. Maybe not the Littlefinger-Ros/whore scene. Rest seemed OK to me though.Knowing whats coming, I feel bad for Ned. lol

139	NW Deserter	2011-05-29	I enjoyed this one, though episode 6 was better. Random notes:
-Ghost got a name finally!
-I really enjoyed Osha's scene with Theon and Aemon. I also just realized that the actress playing Osha is Tonks from the Harry Potter movies!
-The NW vows gave me chills, as did the heart tree. Good job by the props department there.
-I really, really liked the scene with Jaime and Tywin. Tywin didn't look quite like I pictured him, but the characterization of him so far is great. Really looking forward to him and Tyrion interacting.
-Speaking of which, I missed Tyrion, but I was glad to find out that Shagga has indeed been cast.
-Robert's death didn't have quite the impact on me as it did in the books...I think that's because TV-Robert was much less likeable.
-Glad that they mentioned Stannis a lot, I'm hoping non-readers are starting to wonder about this guy. Should set him up nicely for S2.
-The Renly/Ned conversation was as good as I pictured.
-Jorah and Dany both did great this episode, but for once I'll have to give Drogo the honor of the best character across the Sea. That speech had me fired up!
-The final scene was good, though probably one of the weaker endings for me. Again, this is probably just because I knew what was going to happen, and the acting/action was average. In comparison, I also knew about the crowning from last week, but the tension was built up so nicely and Harry Lloyd gave an amazing performance.
-I think I've pinpointed my biggest disappointment of the series...Aiden Gillen. His Littlefinger is simply flat and uninspired, and it pains me to say this because he's such a unique character in the books.
-Speaking of that, the scene where he's "training" Ros and the other whore was just kinda stupid.
Overall, probably a 7/10. One of the weakest episodes IMO, but there were still some great moments. I'm very much looking forward to all the stuff for next week:
-Tyrion, Bronn, and the mountain clans
-Jon's fight with the wight
-Syrio/Arya/the kingsguard
-Robb turning into a badass
140	maxlongstreet	2011-05-29	Eh.  Underwhelmed.  The last scene was good, but there was too much made up crap otherwise.Completely agree. Worst episode thus far. I'm not opposed to made up stuff in theory - I've liked a lot of it in other episodes - but here, the made up crap was universally bad. If D&D think Littlefinger is the kind of person to bare his soul to a couple of whores, then I think they've missed the boat on his character. Tywin scene also pretty much sucked balls.NW liked the episode but also pointed to the sad fact that Gillen's probably the weakest cast member right now. It's not that he can't act; it's that he's made some poor choices in how to play the character. Littlefinger should act like a lighthearted charmer for whom everything is a joke. Instead, Gillen is playing him like a flat-voiced sociopath. The scary thing about Littlefinger should be his opacity - underneath the charming facade lies what? Instead, between D&D's obvious writing and Gillen's acting choices, there's not a lot of mystery there.

142	Spanky	2011-05-29	I always love watching a scene where a woman is shoving her fingers up another woman's ass.  I just think it was pretty stupid to have Littlefinger yelling some important character backstory over the groans.  Come on, if you're going to distract us with sex, don't do it while also yelling important stuff at us.  Separate the two!
Also, not impressed with Tywin's portrayal so far, and I even love the actor.  So far he's come across as a crazy old man who likes to gut things.  =\
Other than that, great episode.  Is it just me or is Dany getting hotter and hotter?
143	Ormond	2011-05-29	I didn't watch anything early and just read the first couple of pages and the last page of the "early viewers" thread --
I guess I agree that the Littlefinger scene near the start was over the top for me and seemed put in primarily for HBO's sexploitation factor. At least the writers did manage to do a lot of great character development for Littlefinger during it, but personally I wish they'd found a way to do it with background visuals that weren't quite so graphic. But I think we can't expect anything else from HBO, and should just be grateful and amazed that the series as a whole has managed to be so wonderful in spite of that sexploitation pressure. 
I thought the acting was marvelous. The friendship between Jon and Sam was extremely well portrayed. Ned's combination of honor and cluelessness was excellently shown. The scenes with Daenerys and Drogo were amazing. I really didn't think a whole hour had gone by when the episode ended, because it kept my attention so well. 
In all, a marvelous piece of acting, direction, and production. /smile.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
144	Ran	2011-05-29	That thread's closed.There were few "made up" scenes -- four to my count, Tywin-Jaime (which was very good, IMO), Littlefinger and Ros (mixed bag), the brief Jon and Sam scene on the Wall (seemed a little pointless, I admit, from my perspective, but non-readers may have needed it), and Osha and Theon (good scene).Our recap, analysis, and chapter-by-chapter breakdown is up.
145	CelticCail	2011-05-29	More comments:
What's with changing Pyp's story or meshing it with Dareon or whatever?
That heart tree face just looked stupid.  I half expected a squirrel to jump out of its mouth.
I didn't really care that Robert was dying, and that scene was so emotional for me in the books with the love and trust between Robert and Ned.  It was so detached.  "I'm dying.  "Oh, okay.  Sucks, man.  Lata." 
I can't get past Osha being Tonks.  Like someone on the early thread said, "I keep waiting for her hair to turn pink." 
I'm officially sick of Roz.  Go away.  What a stupid, unnecessary scene.  
Besides hitting us over the head with a metaphor, why was Tywin skinning a deer?  Doesn't seem like something very lordly to do.
Yes, I'm complaining a lot, but I think it's legitimate.  I LOOOOVED the last two episodes and this one just left me cold.
That being said, Drogo's speech = great.  I think those are the most words I've ever heard come out of Jason Momoa's mouth at once.
Lots of talking about Stannis = good.  Seeing Ghost = good.  I'll watch it again and see what I think later but I wanted more.
146	iheartseverus	2011-05-29	Also, not impressed with Tywin's portrayal so far, and I even love the actor.  So far he's come across as a crazy old man who likes to gut things.  =\This.  Charles Dance's power on-screen is largely centered in his eyes--that cold, basilisk stare that just chills your blood, like staring into a shark's eyes.  So, to have him gutting a stag (yup, I got the symbolism..), his back to Jaime while he talks instead of staring down Jaime face to face, well, its much less than it could have been.
147	Trebla	2011-05-29	Wow, surprised at the hate on the episode. I thought it was the best ep. to date.
From the previews for next week, looks like Joffrey will be dismissing Ser Barristan. They showed the other KG members drawing their swords and you can just see Selmy facing them. I hope they show the Goldcloaks trying to arrest him so he can deliver a beatdown. The non-readers need to see how baddass he is.
And looks like the Hound will finally have something to do as he appears to be arresting Sansa next week. Being a Sansa-hater, I'm a little disappointed she doesn't appear to have tipped Cersei off

148	smidget25	2011-05-29	Oh Ned, of all the people to trust, why LITTLEFINGER?! It was beyond frustrating watching this episode. I've read the books, so it's not like I didn't see it coming, but it was still painful to watch. Cersei warns him to back off, Renly spells Cersei's actions out to him in capital letters, LF even backs him up, and yet Ned still does nothing.  /shocked.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':shocked:' /> An amazing episode though. Things are going down now. I'm curious to see how they'll handle Renly and Stannis now, or will that not be til Season 2?
149	Lord Godric	2011-05-29	Wow, surprised at the hate on the episode. I thought it was the best ep. to date.Agreed, this was my absolute favorite episode so far. The only qualm I had about it was Littlefinger's scene in the brothel which felt absolutely unnecessary.  But other than that, so much better than all the rest, IMO.
150	legba11	2011-05-29	I think this was my least favorite episode so far. Still good, but underwhelming.  It is a shame as this is probably the most signficant episode of the first season for shaping the series.
The early scenes (Tywin and Littlefinger) were way too long and these are two of my favorite characters.
The wall stuff was great and well done.  
The Dothraki stuff was great with the exception of the poisoning itself.  It seemed to miss the mark.
MarK Addy, you did great honor to Robert.  You will be missed.
151	silkymoonshine	2011-05-29	I thought the sixth was better, but this came as a close second. The Tywin/Jaime scene was perfection. I just hope this thread doesn't get hijacked by discussion of sex in the series, like the other one was. Isn't there a thread just for that? 
I was weirded out by Tonks as well. GRRM has said that he loved the actress' portrayal of Osha, so I guess we'll see. But so far, my biggest 'wtf' at the casting directors. How is she supposed to carry Bran around now? /tongue.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' /> Soon the actor playing Bran will be just as tall as she is!
I don't get the Pyp/Dareon thing either. They got an extra to play Dareon, no idea why now Pyp is being sent to another castle to sing.
I'm gonna miss Mark Addy. And Joffrey's reactions to Robert in this episode were pure gold. I'm really impressed they got as many good young/child actors as they did, they're usually terrible.
152	iheartseverus	2011-05-29	MarK Addy, you did great honor to Robert.  You will be missed.Yes.  Kudos, Mark Addy.  Kudos.  /bowdown.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bowdown:' />
153	NW Deserter	2011-05-29	Yes, I'm complaining a lot, but I think it's legitimate.  I LOOOOVED the last two episodes and this one just left me cold.This is how I felt, too.Oh forgot to mention, I'm a little disappointed they've only named one of Drogo's bloodriders, but Rakharo is definitely a badass in this series.
154	tybeechris	2011-05-29	Littlefinger sex scene - yuk, could have edited the visual part of the sex and left in the talking easily. 
The rest great. I think Tywin radiated power. Drogo's speech was fluent. I had worried he would sound like a Klingon. 
No matter how many times I read the books, I want to hit Ned Stark up the side of the head and bang some common sense into him!  Course if any of the Starks had common sense, we would not have had a story to begin with.
155	Trebla	2011-05-29	I tend to like all of the added material. For a book veteran it feels like we are getting behind the scenes details. Really looking forward to next week since GRRM wrote it and want to see what new scenes he adds.
The Tywin/Jaime scene is still my favorite part of the episode and again I actually like that Tywin is skinning the buck. It symbolized him gutting House Baratheon and it also shows he's a man who doesn't mind getting his hands dirty. The blood just wipes off. I also loved, "Are you going to say something clever? Go on...say something clever." Jaime is totally cowed by him. Loved it.

156	fitheach	2011-05-29	After all the pre-viewing hate, I was expecting a horrible episode...
No, I didn't like the scene with Littlefinger and Ros- and I'm a bit annoyed with them (the writers? HBO? D&D?) for allowing that scene, despite that- it was a good episode. Loved the Tywin introduction, and Drogo's scene was pretty awesome! Although, the "rape the women and kill the children" (of Westeros), not cool... 
But hey, thaaat's Drogo!

157	BronnsBastard	2011-05-29	Very disappointing. Robert's death was poorly done, Robert speaking with almost complete lucidity. Did Ned express any sadness to see his friend dying? Lord Tywin Lannister, the "richest man in the seven kingdoms" as this series likes to emphasize is introduced doing the job of a steward? The Lord of Casterly Rock needs to skin his own supper? Will we see Stannis laying the rushes at Storm's End in the opening of Season 2?
It's a creative choice by the producers/directors, and it's one that subtracts, like what feels to me too many of their choices do (more pointless nudity this episode).
158	legba11	2011-05-29	Ned trusts Littlefinger because he is the worst player in the "Game of Thrones" in the history of mankind.  That is his tragic flaw.
His wife told him to trust Littlefinger, she's known him since he was a boy.  So he trusts him.  And thus begins the Catelyn Stark = AntiChrist debate once again /smile.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
159	Ormond	2011-05-29	Although, the "rape the women and kill the children" (of Westeros), not cool!Did he say "kill the children"? I thought it was "rape their women and make their children slaves."  Horrible sentiments, but highly realistic for a nomadic warlord, I thought.
160	Theano	2011-05-29	Am I the only person in the world who really, really loved the Littlefinger sexposition scene?  I don't care whether he would/would not talk that frankly to any of his whores, and I don't care that it was more (oh, no!) sex.  Littlefinger knows about screwing people over, and making them like it, and that's what that scene was about for me.Liked the Tywin scene, though not as much as the Littlefinger scene.  That looked like a real stag he was really skinning; if it was, I sure hope they ate it!  (And did they have to pay him extra to do that?  Ew!)
161	smidget25	2011-05-29	I tend to like all of the added material. For a book veteran it feels like we are getting behind the scenes details. Really looking forward to next week since GRRM wrote it and want to see what new scenes he adds.The Tywin/Jaime scene is still my favorite part of the episode and again I actually like that Tywin is skiing the buck.

Go on...say something clever." Jaime is totally cowed by him. Loved it.I agree. The added scenes make me enjoy the series even more tbh, because they're things we haven't read in the books. It's nice to get additional information and see how things would have panned out from other perspectives. I wouldn't like the show to be an exact copy of the original material, other wise there's not much point in watching it. With the exception of the LF scene (which went on a bit too long) I've liked these extra surprises.
162	iheartseverus	2011-05-29	So weird, how few people are here now--19 members??!!  Usually this thread would be flooded after each episode.  Maybe its because its a holiday weekend (in the US) ?  Quien sabe...
163	CelticCail	2011-05-29	I thought it was "rape their women and make their children slaves."  Well, Dany is extremely anti-rape and anti-slave so it seemed a little odd that he was promising her these things to me!  Eh.  Maybe she doesn't know she feels that way yet... or something.

As much as I love the show and the story, I don't think I am enjoying it as much as I would have had I not already read the books.  I know everything that is going to happen already, so that is why I look forward to added scenes.  Most of them have been scenes that I think could have been straight from the book, there are obviously exceptions.  However, overall I have been very satisfied with the scenes added to the show.
166	Spanky	2011-05-29	Well, Dany is extremely anti-rape and anti-slave so it seemed a little odd that he was promising her these things to me!  Eh.  Maybe she doesn't know she feels that way yet... or something.Lol.  Dany was just all shaking her head going, "That's my Drogo."
167	iheartseverus	2011-05-29	Everyone watched it on HBO Go; that thread has 19 pages, so no one's here.  Lame.True.  I watched it, too, on HBO Go last week, but was looking forward to the rush of input here when the rest of the world chimed in.  Just feels strange..
168	Wras	2011-05-29	I liked the episode overall, as a whole, but many parts of it fell a little flat.
Littlefinger's scene just didn't do it for me. Didn't like it last week, couldn't pay attention this week. I liked Tywin's intro and all the scenes with Dany and Jon, very well done. Is that Essos they're in? Whatever part of the world, I'm becoming very immersed in it from a visual point of view.
The only thing that really bothered me was Ned and Cersei's confrontation. The setting was off from the books. Dialogue, acting, cinematography? Great. Excellent stuff. The place they chose to do it? Meh. But I will chalk this up to the scene just being that good in my head that it would be too hard to do it justice.
Also, something about Littlefinger's voice just rubs me the wrong way. Maybe it's in the sense that the character's supposed to inspire distrust, maybe it's just poor acting. Can't decide which it is yet.
169	fitheach	2011-05-29	Lol.  Dany was just all shaking her head going, "That's my Drogo."Yeah, she was thinking- "Oh, that's my crazy warlord hubby! He doesn't really mean it..." /dunno.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':dunno:' />
170	Bronn Stone	2011-05-29	I'm with Trebla.  Best episode yet.  Good pacing and lots of excitement.  Gonna watch it again.
171	MusaYo	2011-05-29	I liked the episode, even if I knew what was going to happen, still kept me on the edge of my seat.
I think Ned is an honorable man and just can't act any other way, it's not because he's not a smart man, he can't act against the principles he has lived by all his life, his is a tragic story because of his loyalty to others.
I also liked Tywin's intro and the scene with Jamie, great scene between the two actors, believed them as father and son.
172	Ormond	2011-05-29	Well, Dany is extremely anti-rape and anti-slave so it seemed a little odd that he was promising her these things to me!  Eh.  Maybe she doesn't know she feels that way yet... or something.I don't think he was necessarily promising these things to Dany. He was promising them to the Dothraki warriors he would be leading in battle across the dreaded salt seas.
173	Mike	2011-05-29	Yeah, she was thinking- "Oh, that's my crazy warlord hubby! He doesn't really mean it..." /dunno.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':dunno:' />My take on her thought process was that her desire for Drogo to give her the Iron Chair wasn't what she expected, that she never fully understood the warlike nature of her husband, and now she's unleashed him on the people that she would rule.
174	iheartseverus	2011-05-29	I don't think he was necessarily promising these things to Dany. He was promising them to the Dothraki warriors he would be leading in battle across the dreaded salt seas.Yes.  And, I think, sort of shouting to the gods (do Dothraki have gods?) or to the universe at large that this is what he would do.  I saw it as the Dothraki version of taking a vow, making an oath.  It wasn't about Dany.
175	Bronn_ManofHonour	2011-05-29	I liked the episode, even if I knew what was going to happen, still kept me on the edge of my seat.I think Ned is an honorable man and just can't act any other way, it's not because he's not a smart man, he can't act against the principles he has lived by all his life, his is a tragic story because of his loyalty to others.I also liked Tywin's intro and the scene with Jamie, great scene between the two actors, believed them as father and son.One of the theme's in the series is that honour gets you nowhere. Men with honour only really find success when they team up with unhonourable people... see Jon with Samwell, Stannis with Davos, and Tyrion with Bronn.But having no honour bears heavily on some people. Jamie eventually turns on Cersei in part because he cannot handle being held without honour by most men that have it. It was a bit understated in their brief scene together but Barristan despised Jamie for stabbing Aerys in the back.
176	snake	2011-05-29	Good episode.
Not much to complain about other than Littlefinger.  IMO, this is the worst casting and acting in the series.  They really missed the boat with this guy.
177	iheartseverus	2011-05-29	But having no honour bears heavily on some people. Jamie eventually turns on Cersei in part because he cannot handle being held without honour by most men that have it. It was a bit understated in their brief scene together but Barristan despised Jamie for stabbing Aerys in the back.I agree with the general outline here.  But in the book, Jaime didn't stab Aerys in the back, he slit his throat.  HBO changed it to a stab in the back, I guess to underline the disrespect everyone now has for what Jaime did.  I like your general thesis--having no honor bears heavily on some people.

HBO changed it to a stab in the back, I guess to underline the disrespect everyone now has for what Jaime did.  I like your general thesis--having no honor bears heavily on some people.He spends 20 odd years publicly doing the dirty work for Tywin and Cersei, and after Cersei's gain the Regency (actually being the defacto monarch) and casts him aside (refuses to ransom him), he really has had enough of her. After his father's speech of legacy being everything, I wonder if Jamie realizes his.... that and the fact there is room for nobody in Cersei's sphere except Cersei. Joffrey and Tommen are a means to and end for her. His forced ignoring of his own children as left him bitterly alone with his brother Tyrion as his only friend.

Loved it.Well, I've been pretty much silent thus far on the show as time has constrained me...That being said, I agree completely on the aspects of the "new" material that has been added.  Not a single scene has been wasted, and for me only the Renly/Loras scene was a mistake.  Each one has added more to what I already knew, or lent more to what I believed from the book.The Tywin/Jaime scene was excellent.The Littlefinger scene (he's one actor I'm still a little leary on) does work, even if it isn't exactly what one would think of when you compare the character to the book.It was a highly satisfying episode.
180	Anomandaris86	2011-05-29	There's one very important comment in that lesbian scene. Littlefinger says he's saving himself for another. Can this be another area where the TV show is spoiling something in the books for us? Originally I thought while reading that Littlefinger might be scheming to make himself Warden of the North and end up marrying Catelyn after all. But then the Red Wedding happened, and he didn't seem all that disturbed by it. In fact, when Sansa tells him to give Harrenhall to Lord Frey in book 4, he simply laughs and says, "Maybe I will." Hardly the attitude of a grieving man. But now with his comment in that scene, it seems that maybe he really did plan on marrying Catelyn. Or was he talking about Sansa? Or someone else entirely?
181	MusaYo	2011-05-29	One of the theme's in the series is that honour gets you nowhere. Men with honour only really find success when they team up with unhonourable people... see Jon with Samwell, Stannis with Davos, and Tyrion with Bronn.But having no honour bears heavily on some people. Jamie eventually turns on Cersei in part because he cannot handle being held without honour by most men that have it. It was a bit understated in their brief scene together but Barristan despised Jamie for stabbing Aerys in the back. I understand your theory, though I think of Samwell as being honorable also, but having learned to trust few people.
182	Bronn_ManofHonour	2011-05-29	There's one very important comment in that lesbian scene. Littlefinger says he's saving himself for another. Can this be another area where the TV show is spoiling something in the books for us? Originally I thought while reading that Littlefinger might be scheming to make himself Warden of the North and end up marrying Catelyn after all. But then the Red Wedding happened, and he didn't seem all that disturbed by it. In fact, when Sansa tells him to give Harrenhall to Lord Frey in book 4, he simply laughs and says, "Maybe I will." Hardly the attitude of a grieving man. But now with his comment in that scene, it seems that maybe he really did plan on marrying Catelyn. Or was he talking about Sansa? Or someone else entirely?Baelish has as much designs on the Iron Throne as anyone else. Heck this was even illustrated a couple of episodes with him standing and staring at the empty throne. He doesn't have much money.... and NO army.... but he does have incredible sway over weak willed women. He is marrying (and murdering) his way to many lands and titles. Obviously Sansa and the North is next for him. I imagine after that it could be Asha Greyjoy.I think in the end Arya runs him through... at least I hope so!
183	OneTrueWarg	2011-05-29	I think they are giving to much away to easy like jorah's love for dany and, I don't remember that scene with the little boy talking about the spider with him either was that in the book?
184	RAddichio	2011-05-29	Just voted on ep 7 - gave it a 9.  Excellent acting spearheaded by the actor playing Lord Baelish.  His line delivery is precisely as written - sinister beyond belief.  Petyr glides along in that perfect costume as though he's an evil spirit - feet barely touching the ground.
The on-the-job-whore training scene was gratuitous but probably added with men in particular in mind.  Said as much to my hubby and he gave a devlish chuckle which confirmed the motivation.  He did not disapprove   /rofl2.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':rofl:' />  You guys never saw a girl on girl scene you didn't like - right? So, HBO wanted to make sure you were happy in that way as well. 
With the exception of that particular scene, I thought tonight's ep was outstanding.  Lovely landscape at the heart tree ceremony and great comraderie between Jon, Sam and their black watch brothers.
Almost don't want next week's episode to arrive too quickly, because I fear it will bring a strong shock for non-readers and cause readers to revisit those dark moments at the end of Book 1.  Only consolation is knowing that S2 is already in planning stages.  /thumbsup.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':thumbsup:' />

Or someone else entirely?I took him to mean two different people in that instance. Saving himself for Lysa (remember he said she wasn't particularly attractive but came from good lineage) and went on to discuss being in love with Catelyn. Which is a conclusion I can come to only because I've read the books. So maybe I'm overcomplicating it. But the mentioning of that someone being not particularly attractive is important, I suspect.Catelyn/Sansa - prettyLysa - not so much

187	Starkess	2011-05-29	Phew, had to read all 19 pages of the other thread...
Anyway, loved this episode!!
The only thing I disliked what the LF-porno scene. Illogical, awkward, unnecessary, yeah it sucked. But I doubt any of us are going to change our minds about that, so I'll save it for the sexuality thread if I really want to hash that out.
It's so sad to see this happening to Ned. I KNOW what's coming but I still can't help but hope that, somehow, this time it will be different.
Loved Drogo's speech! Man that was so great. And damn, I am so glad that man never wears a shirt. /drool.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':drool:' />
I just want to watch the last 3 episodes nowwwwwwwwwwwww!
(Nitpickiest of nitpicks: Why is Sam wearing BROWN?!! For some reason that drove me nuts.)
188	Wolfheart	2011-05-29	Anyone else bothered that Jaimes hair was brown in the Tywin/Jaime scene?
189	Starkess	2011-05-29	Anyone else bothered that Jaimes hair was brown in the Tywin/Jaime scene?I noticed that it seemed a lot darker than before! I thought I was just imagining it, though.
190	Faint	2011-05-29	I'm surprised not more has been made about the changes to the scene between Cersei and Ned. Quite obviously they've decided to change Cersei's character a lot but it's getting to the point where it's getting too excessive for my taste.
191	Bubba	2011-05-29	Loved it, aside from the porn scene. I'm okay with "grown up" television, but there has to be a line somewhere, and this episode clearly crossed it. "Play with her ass....", really?  I hope the producers are hearing this feedback. Petyr's speech itself was great, however.
192	Lord O' Bones	2011-05-29	These threads could suck the joy out of a blow job.
193	Jaime L	2011-05-29	Another episode that nailed the pivotal final scene. Poor Ned just keeps stumbling into situations where he's outmanned 15-1. I'm sure if he entered the joust he'd somehow end up riding against an entire cavalry unit. Think Iain Glenn deserves a shout-out for being picture perfect week to week. He is Jorah Mormont...he inhabits the character. Can't wait to see him as Obi-Wan in the next Star Wars remake.The Jon scenes are authentic in that they bore me in the exact same way they did in the books. Definitely didn't miss the lack of Jon the last couple episodes - always the most dreaded chapters for me, especially book one in where Jon spends 98% of his time whining. However, as insult to injury, my favorite character on the Wall, Maester Aemon is also the worst casting in the series thus far IMO. Speaking of maesters, brutal dig by Maester Luwin on Theon. Was, like, "Oh, snap!" And from maybe the most unexpected source possible.Have mixed feelings on the Tywin-Jaime scene. Another scene we never saw in the books, and thought the skinning of the Baratheon Stag was both nice symbolism and a hint into Tywin's ruthlessness. That said, the actor doesn't yet inhabit Tywin's unique form of badassery. Somehow wanted to see him be cooler, more emotionless. That said, really liked the brief shot of the Lannister encampment - really captured the sense of scale that I felt was missing from earlier scenes. Bodes well for the future battles.Maybe it's just me but Dany is getting hotter every week.I missed seeing Lancel this week. His wardrobe is consistently the funniest thing in this series.
194	SergioCQH	2011-05-30	Loved this episode. Most exciting one yet. All the added scenes were great. Charles Dance is absolutely amazing. I'm now wishing that Tyrion didn't kill him. Absolutely cannot wait to see the scene where Tywin hears the news of Jaime's capture.
195	The Brandon Stark	2011-05-30	Good episode.Not much to complain about other than Littlefinger.  IMO, this is the worst casting and acting in the series.  They really missed the boat with this guy. Sorry bro, but you're out of your mind. Littlefinger is perfect. Witty, sly, unassuming, perfect.
196	Bronn Stone	2011-05-30	I understand the challenge faced by Aiden Gillen.  LF could easily become a cartoon.  Snidely Whiplash with a mockingbird.  So he has to play things down.  I think he's doing a great job.
I also agree with Sergio - Charles Dance is great.  I can't imagine Lord Tywin actually skinning a stag in the middle of battle preparations, so I don't agree 100% with the directorial decision, but I DO think he'd know how and he'd do it cleanly, efficiently and properly if he did.  Dance was amazing.
197	Analu	2011-05-30	I've loved every episode so far. All of it. It's beyond my wildest expectations. 
Drogo's speech was awesome and gave me chickenskin. I had to go out to my garage and do a few rounds on the heavy bag, I was feeling so pumped up! Total fantasy geek/pseudo-tough guy right here!
198	Sheppo	2011-05-30	His wardrobe is consistently the funniest thing in this series.His wardrobe and hair remind me of Edward the spoony bard from Final Fantasy IV. All he needs is a harp. If anyone here has played that game they'll know what I mean.
199	Commodore	2011-05-30	the fact that the brothel scene has been universally panned as gratuitous makes me wonder how the director/writers could not have seen what we saw. That whole scene was just painful.
The rest was great, enjoyed Dance as Tywin the most.
200	Kyptastic	2011-05-30	You can't say the scene was 'universally panned'. There's plenty of people who didn't have an issue with it, or liked it for the symbolism it provided for Littlefinger's exposition. .
Anyway, loved the episode. Will be interesting to see what GRRM comes up with for next week.
201	Bronn Stone	2011-05-30	You can't say the scene was 'universally panned'. There's plenty of people who didn't have an issue with it, or liked it for the symbolism it provided for Littlefinger's exposition. .Not in my universe.  Here, it was panned.(I do actually appreciate the challenge to the writers - how to frame expository speeches in a way that doesn't become tedious.  There are a lot of them and have to be a lot of them.  But this one was jarring.)
202	wandarah	2011-05-30	I thought the porno-scene was pretty good myself. 
I love how he's all 'blah de blah' 'play with her ass' 'blah de blah'. Cracked me up. 
I do love hot chicks being all naked and stuff though...
I usually associate with non-readers in regards to the series, and they're loving it beyond reason.

203	The Anti-Targ	2011-05-30	Am I the only person in the world who really, really loved the Littlefinger sexposition scene?  I don't care whether he would/would not talk that frankly to any of his whores, and I don't care that it was more (oh, no!) sex.  Littlefinger knows about screwing people over, and making them like it, and that's what that scene was about for me.Liked the Tywin scene, though not as much as the Littlefinger scene.  That looked like a real stag he was really skinning; if it was, I sure hope they ate it!  (And did they have to pay him extra to do that?  Ew!)It was a real deer all right, but it wasn't real guts.I like a bit of subtlety in my symbolism. The whore scene had none. The Tywin stag skinning had none either. And clearly both scenes offended people's sensibilities.
204	Carldog	2011-05-30	People are bitching about LF because of the character he is... Think about it, he is not a person you would trust or befriend because he doesn't care about anyone. So why  complain about the role?  It's who he is.  The guy is a shmuck in the books and I think the actor is on par with his portrayal.  Sure, somethings are off, but this isn't a guy your supposed to cheer for, so just role with it.
205	Tyrion Lannister	2011-05-30	His wardrobe and hair remind me of Edward the spoony bard from Final Fantasy IV. All he needs is a harp. If anyone here has played that game they'll know what I mean. /laugh.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':laugh:' />  That's PERFECT!  Now if only some weakass old man would come in and try to beat him up with a rod/staff.I really enjoyed the episode on the whole, but I did not like the Littlefinger scene.  Not because of the nudity (I don't care about that), but more because I felt like his betrayal of Ned might have been a bit more shocking to newbies if they hadn't just seen this bit that basically says, "This guy here?  He's a slimy dick who can't be trusted."Other than that, I enjoyed it.  Tywin isn't exactly how I pictured him physically, but I have a feeling I'm going to dig the character if that scene is anything to go by.  This was among my favorite episodes so far, despite the absence of both Dinklage and Maisie, who have been two of the real standouts in the fist season.
206	Rockroi	2011-05-30	The Jon scenes are authentic in that they bore me in the exact same way they did in the books. Definitely didn't miss the lack of Jon the last couple episodes - always the most dreaded chapters for me, especially book one in where Jon spends 98% of his time whining. However, as insult to injury, my favorite character on the Wall, Maester Aemon is also the worst casting in the series thus far IMO. /agree.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':agree:' /> Like looking into a mirror.
207	Eponine	2011-05-30	Was lukewarm on the episode - nothing that really drove me crazy, but definitely not as good as last weeks and none of the scenes blew me away with awesomeness. I thought there were a lot of unnecessary characterization changes.
Enjoyed the Tywin scene. It was a good introduction and a good way to keep Jaime current.
I had a hard time with Cersei this episode, felt like she was an actress delivering lines instead of a person having a conversation.
As a book fan, I can't possibly condone the characterization of Littlefinger running his mouth about his feelings for Cat to his new whore. 
Robert's death was fine but lacked the intensity of the his conversation with Ned the previous week.
I don't like how Osha is being portrayed. I find her voice crazy annoying and her character overacted. 
Jon is a twat, and I'm fine with this, I'd be disappointed if he weren't. Why is he not wearing all black? I like Sam 1000% more than in the books though - it's better not to be stuck in certain people's heads. Jon doesn't deserve a friend like him, but hey, Jon rarely deserves anything he gets.
Renly is also a twat, and an idiot if he thought that declaring his desire for kingship to Ned would win him any support. I like book Renly much better, and his plan to help Ned become the real power as regent was a much better idea. But unlike several people, I thought that Littlefinger was great.
I don't find Dany or the Dothraki convincing in any way.
Poor Ned, it's hard to watch him sometimes. He seemed so clueless and outmatched just like he should. But another Littlefinger mischaracterization.
Yeah people who don't like nitpickers can go... Well you know... Sorry I wasn't that impressed with this episode. It wasn't bad, but I thought that last week was really well done, and neither the scenes nor the acting in this one compared well.
Concern for the end of the season: don't feel at this point any particular liking for Robb or feel any reason to root for him in what comes next. In this, I feel the same way with the show as with the book, but think it's a flaw in the book that the show could have improved upon.
208	ENikolai	2011-05-30	Another fantastic episode. I love the Night's Watch scenes the most, I've found. I wasn't very happy with the gratuitous sex scene though, and I suspect that Rahm Emanuel would make a far better Littlefinger (not a compliment to Mr. Emanuel). The only thing I'm truly unhappy with overall is the actor they chose for Renly Baratheon, as he's too much of a stereotypical weak and effeminate gay person. It's been a while since I read the books, but I remember Renly as being almost as manly as Robert, and with a huge mane of black hair. Regardless of this, thumbs up... this will probably be my favourite TV-series until the day I die.
209	busyizzy	2011-05-30	One of the theme's in the series is that honour gets you nowhere. Men with honour only really find success when they team up with unhonourable people... see Jon with Samwell, Stannis with Davos, and Tyrion with Bronn.But having no honour bears heavily on some people. Jamie eventually turns on Cersei in part because he cannot handle being held without honour by most men that have it. It was a bit understated in their brief scene together but Barristan despised Jamie for stabbing Aerys in the back.Jon and Samwell? I'm not sure I'd agree with that .... the whole baby-switching business tells you that Jon isn't an honorable as Ned Stark - which is probably exactly what he needs to survive and why Ned didn't...
210	snake	2011-05-30	Sorry bro, but you're out of your mind. Littlefinger is perfect. Witty, sly, unassuming, perfect.His voice is almost monotone and his delivery is mostly flat and lifeless.  I guess it is my own prejudice but this guy is nothing like the Littlefinger I pictured and has done little to change my mind, unlike some of the other casting choices.
211	Renly Baratheon	2011-05-30	I liked the episode and enjoyed both new scenes. Tywin-Jamie because of the way it showed just how much of a dick Tywin is yet his children still hold him in such awe(His dickness totally inherited by Cersei). And the LF porno scene not just because of Roz's incredible rack but because it gives the incite into just how much of a Machiavellian the little twitwad is
212	Mad Queen	2011-05-30	I have a few questions about the episode:
- Why did HBO include a porn film trailer before the episode started? /stillsick.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':stillsick:' />
- Why was Jaime getting advice from a butcher and calling him father?
- Why didn't anyone complain when Jon and Sam left a few parts out of their vows?
Robert's death scene could have been a lot better. Robert should at least have tried to sound like somebody who is dying. But Drogo's speech made up for it. Well done.
Littlefinger doesn't bother me in the light of all the other things that bother me.
213	malek	2011-05-30	NW liked the episode but also pointed to the sad fact that Gillen's probably the weakest cast member right now. It's not that he can't act; it's that he's made some poor choices in how to play the character. Littlefinger should act like a lighthearted charmer for whom everything is a joke. Instead, Gillen is playing him like a flat-voiced sociopath. The scary thing about Littlefinger should be his opacity - underneath the charming facade lies what? Instead, between D&D's obvious writing and Gillen's acting choices, there's not a lot of mystery there.Said long ago that John Simm would have made a perfect Littlefinger.
214	Mad Queen	2011-05-30	Replying to a post from the closed thread:At the same time, the overall message of that scene encompasses how LF  can go- effortlessly -from being perceived (correctly) as a  self-possessed schemer who wants only what is best for himself and  somehow transform himself (in the eyes of his "partner") into somebody  who is seen (incorrectly) as having scruples and morals and will do what  is best for others.  The whole point of the scene- once we look beyond  the flapping boobs and the moans -is that Littlefinger creeps not onto  you physically but into you mentally.  As he states, he knows that he is  "...not fooling them Â<U+0085>" and that "they know what he isÂ<U+0085>"  They know  what LF is, and its his job- much like the whore's job, "to make them  forget what they knowÂ<U+0085> that takes timeÂ<U+0085>"  By the time its all over, the customer thinks he;s actually really GOOD  at this; that he has the ability- has always had the ability -to win the  slut over.  The slut- the Littlefinger - cannot POSSIBLY stand in the  way of a man who is just so ... GOOD!   After all, Ned "knows heÂ<U+0092>s  better than other men..."  Are we really to believe that Ned Stark did  not think this? That Ned Stark had not forgotten what LF was?  And that  LF had not MADE him forget?When did LF ever make Ned think he is a better man? LF's whole attitude was 'Stark, you don't have a clue about what you are doing, but I'm helping you anyway despite all your foolishness'. He didn't use a whore's strategy at all, unless LF's being despicable was supposed to make Ned feel better in comparison.
215	A<U+0089>tA©	2011-05-30	Said long ago that John Simm would have made a perfect Littlefinger.John Simm would be a great Roose Bolton.
216	legba11	2011-05-30	Just voted on ep 7 - gave it a 9.  Excellent acting spearheaded by the actor playing Lord Baelish.  His line delivery is precisely as written - sinister beyond belief.

Only consolation is knowing that S2 is already in planning stages.  /thumbsup.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':thumbsup:' />Ned isn't dying till Episode 9.  Look at the titles. Unless you mean some other dark moment.Tywin is skinning the deer he killed (I assume) because it shows the audience the difference between him and his two "true" children (Jaime and Cersei).  They both walk around like Lannisters and boss people around liek Lannisters yet they aren't always willing to do the hard work that is needed.  He is skinning the deer because he killed the deer and he is going to eat the deer.  He sees his children as poiled brats living off his legacy and hard work.  Listen to the disdain he has for Jaime.Tywin's children all dissapoint him.  They don't live up to legend of Tywin Lannister.  They all got one aspect, yet lacking the other two peices fall short in their fathers (and their own) eyes.  Jaime has his martial prowess, he is the warrior Tywin.  Able to lead men and kill men. Cersei has his drive and ambition, yet lacks his cunning and skill for playing "The Game".  Being a woman, she could never be the warrior Tywin.  Tyrion is the closest to Tywin (There are only two people in the books who KNOW Tywin and who we hear from, and his sister says this directly).  However, he cannot be the warrior Tywin, he cannot lead men, and despite his valor when needed, cannot be that Tywin.  He also does not have Cersei's drive.  He is happy being rich, being drunk, being whored.  He does not really want to play "The Game".  He also hated by his father because he killed the only thing Tywin truly loved other than himself.I can't wait to see Charles Dance give his stare for the time.

I don't recall that, I guess I tuned in right at 8:00 and saw no previews/trailers!  /stunned.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':stunned:' /> - /rolleyes2.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':rolleyes:' /> I saw nothing wrong with that characterization. That's the kind of thing Tywin would do, he's proud but not arrogant.-Because I didn't think it mattered, plus I don't have them memorized or anything so it seemed fine to me until someone on here brought it up. /tongue.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
218	Lany Cassandra	2011-05-30	I'm surprised not more has been made about the changes to the scene between Cersei and Ned. Quite obviously they've decided to change Cersei's character a lot but it's getting to the point where it's getting too excessive for my taste.What was changed?  Cersei got one of Ned's lines, I think, but other than that, it was nearly word for word from the book? I did warn my husband about the LF/whore scene.  I told him to ignore the girls and listen to what LF says (not sure he completely ignored the girls /rolleyes2.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':rolleyes:' /> )  Afterwards he said "we learned about LF in that scene. he was talking about himself there." so I guess it works.A long time ago, I guess I spoiled my husband and told him Ned dies.  I feel so bad about this.  He was asking after the ending last night. "So when does Ned die?"  "You said he dies, does he get executed?"  I had to nod and not say anything else.  He is really into the series and with Robert dead he is not looking forward to Ned dying too. (they were his two favorites going into the show, but Tyrion has joined them as a favorite and he is a huge Charles Dance fan so he is looking forward to more from him)I found I was able to pretty much block out the whores on the rewatch.

219	Mad Queen	2011-05-30	- /rolleyes2.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':rolleyes:' /> I saw nothing wrong with that characterization. That's the kind of thing Tywin would do, he's proud but not arrogant.It wasn't too bad, but it didn't seem like something Tywin 'the proud and splendid' Lannister would do at that time. He should be doing something like planning a war or polishing his golden armor encrusted with jewels.
220	NW Deserter	2011-05-30	It wasn't too bad, but it didn't seem like something Tywin 'the proud and splendid' Lannister would do at that time. He should be doing something like planning a war or polishing his golden armor encrusted with jewels.But he was planning a war. He explicitly said that he was going to give half his men to Jaime to take to Riverrun. I don't think his opening scene needed to be all the details of his plan. As far as him polishing his armor, him skinning the stag gives similar characterization (not afraid to get his hands dirty), and it's a lot more symbolic.Sorry, just playing devil's advocate. /smile.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
221	Jaxom 1974	2011-05-30	I missed seeing Lancel this week.

Dance was amazing.I'll give you the timimg, if not the location, for the skinning was slightly off, but otherwise everything else rang true from what I'd expect out of Tywin.

222	Mya Stone	2011-05-30	Sigh. You guys are a bunch of wet blankets. I thoroughly enjoyed the Tywin-Jaime scene. The beauty of it was that he could still instill so much fear in his own son without even making eye contact with him. And when you did get the "Tywin stare," it chilled you to the bone. (At least it did for me.) Not to mention, the distance between the two characters speaking. Once Tywin walks over to Jaime and places his hand on his cheek, you get the feeling that this is the most affectionate he's been to his firstborn son in years - if not ever (the irony of the fact that his hands were just more intimately gut-deep in stag is not lost on me). But with that motion, he tells Jaime that it is time for him to become the man he was destined to be. And gosh-darnit, doesn't that just inspire Jaime?And yeah yeah, symbolism blah blah, but I appreciated the fact that Tywin handled the stag with such efficiency. He wasted not a single motion in his dressing of his kill. That is very much in character. I'm not even going to get into the Littlefinger scene. It's been talked to death already. It worked for me. To whoever said that Lancel is dressed like Edward from Final Fantasy, /lol.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lol:' /> SO MUCH TRUTH. Maybe Pycelle can smack him with his walking stick for the full effect. Altogether, for me, the episodes are just getting better and better. Can't wait for the final 3 episodes.

223	Humble Asskicker	2011-05-30	After all the build-up for the Littlefinger brothel scene, I was vastly disappointed. I was expecting a type of explicit sex scene unprecedented for HBO...but it was not. I half-expected to see a woman actually get fingered in the ass or something, but the whole thing was lightly simulated. It was just another sex scene; not particularly shocking either. It pales to some of the stuff on Spartacus.
I didn't even find the exposition egregious. It expounded on necessary information for those unfamiliar to the books and actually gave Littlefinger a history to flesh him out. It reminded me of some of Swearengen's many monologues, though less baroque.
Let's see, what other scenes received melodramatic outcries of despair and much gnashing of teeth from the obsessives? Ah, the Tywin scene. Apparently because he was never mentioned to have dressed animals, he would *never* do something like hunt or skin what he killed. He just sits in his solar all day, reading and adjudicating. I imagine that sort of sweaty bureaucratic exercise is what keeps him as fit as a man half his age. Obviously.
Also, Ghost barking. This is another pet peeve for some people. In the books, Ghost never made a peep. This was menacing in the books. In a live action show, a silent Ghost would make him seem like a fairly docile animal, perhaps something of a halfwit too. Dogs bark, yes; wolves bark too. If you can't separate your mental image of the books' characters to the point that you must absolutely HATE another interpretation, then I guess that's unfortunate for you. But just because you don't like the scene doesn't mean that it isn't a good scene. It's simply a good scene that you have the misfortune to dislike. And Ghost barking as the Night's Watch headed off to the weirwood was a good scene.
So all in all, great stuff, made even better by the ever reliable bitching of obsessives. I just love seeing their noses tweaked.
224	NW Deserter	2011-05-30	My biggest problem with the LF scene wasn't even the sex itself it was that the moaning was drowning out some of his words. It really lessened the dramatic effect of what he was saying, as if the director was intentionally trying to get us to watch the sex instead of listen to LF. JMO I guess.
225	julandro	2011-05-30	I missed seeing Lancel this week. His wardrobe is consistently the funniest thing in this series.As you can imagine, me too I miss my dear Lancel. But I want to see a scene of him and Cersei. NOW!  /sleep.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt='-_-' />
226	Kaitscralt	2011-05-30	Agree with the Humble Asskicker's post basically 100%. After reading a weeks worth of people complaining I was expecting to see some of the worst scenes ever -- and they were pretty typical for HBO.
The only thing that bugged me was how Robert's death seemed much more abrupt on the show than in the books. Maybe Renly could have explained more clearly to Eddard what happened before he got there. 
Still, another great episode for me. Lots of moving stuff, including Drogo's speech.
And the Jorah pardon makes more sense to me now after seeing it. Assuming that the letter said, 'Daenerys is going to be assassinated, so you are free to come home,' makes Jorah's staying seem even more epic. Instead of the poisoned wine being an intentionally failed assassination so that Jorah could get closer to Daenerys by saving her and Varys could remain loyal to both sides, this time it looks like a real attempt on Daenerys (Viserys was always the more important one to the Targaryen loyalists, and nobody knows he is dead yet -- Daenerys is expendable) that Jorah realized was going to happen and saved her just in time. It worked for me.

227	wolverine	2011-05-30	Tywin is skinning the deer he killed (I assume) because it shows the audience the difference between him and his two "true" children (Jaime and Cersei).  They both walk around like Lannisters and boss people around liek Lannisters yet they aren't always willing to do the hard work that is needed.  He is skinning the deer because he killed the deer and he is going to eat the deer.  He sees his children as poiled brats living off his legacy and hard work.  Listen to the disdain he has for Jaime.This was my favorite of the added scenes and I think it almost perfectly introduces Tywin (Dance rocks!).  Even so it is a bit ridiculous that Tywin is skinning his own stag, on a table for some reason? I have probably skinned a 100+ deer and would hang every one if possible.  Plus you don't gut an animal like he did and pull out ropes of garland like entrail.  Anyhow that is really nitpicky as very few viewers have proabably ever butchered an animal or seen anything butchered.  The scene definitely shows that he is not afraid to get dirty and get things done.Hated the LF whore coaching scene.  Ros is very annoying at this point.  I would say that I have found LF's portrayal spot on so far though.Jason Momoa is Khal Drogo.I thought Jorah's actor was too small and old looking but he has done an excellent job.Was Theon a pathetic pervert in the books?Couple people have pointed out how bad Renly's casting is and how changed he is from the books.  I agree 100% with this.
228	NW Deserter	2011-05-30	Was Theon a pathetic pervert in the books?Yes. It's just not really revealed until his PoV's - his attempt to be more like his people with that chick on the boat, his groping of Asha to try and exert his self-perceived superiority, and the fact that he aggressively fucks the Winterfell girl just to ground himself when he sees his plan falling apart. Sex is something he always latches onto to "prove" himself, and if you ask me it makes him that much more pathetic.
229	ser_nerdick	2011-05-30	What was changed?  Cersei got one of Ned's lines, I think, but other than that, it was nearly word for word from the book? In the book Cersei flirts with Ned, placing her hand on his thigh, making suggestive comments, etc. It's one of many examples where Cersei attempts to use sex as power (or as described by Bronn later, the never-empty purse between her legs).In the tv series, Cersei's sexuality is completely changed, or rather nonexistent (other than that she has sex with her brother). There is not a hint of flirty sexiness in the character as played by Headey, just a cold bitch. There isn't a hint of anything actually, just a one-dimensional character who is always a scowling mean bitch.
230	NW Deserter	2011-05-30	I don't think it's fair to call her one-dimensional. We've seen at least one scene where she turns on her charm, back at Winterfell with Sansa. Granted, that was a long time ago, but I think we'll see more of that in this next episode when she coerces Sansa into siding with her.
231	legba11	2011-05-30	Mya (and others), my only problem with the two scenes (Tywin and LF) were they were too long.  They both really seemed excessive to me (especially the LF one).  The same could have been established in half the time.  This would have allowed more time for Robert's death.  This is the king, the #1 guy in "The Game".  He deserved more time for his death.  We don't even see see Tommen and Mycella saying their goodbyes.  People are going to forget they exist, and soon enough they are both going to be propped up for the throne.  They could have also established Donal Noye (is that his name?) is still in King's Landing and getting his prisoners.  He has been gone fore 2 weeks now.  I also would have added a brief scene with Arya and Needle and Syrio.
This was the first episode where I felt they were stretching scenes to reach their 50? minutes, rather than rushing through them to get everything in.  Neither is ideal, but stretching is usually worse than rushing.
232	Volderon	2011-05-30	Maester Luwin constantly owns Theon every episode with one-liners, I love it.
"And failed rebellions."
"Are the two mutually exclusive in your experience?"
LOL.
I liked Jon in the books but in the show he's a whinny little dick.
His father is fighting for his life and all Jon can say is, "Wah, wah, I didn't get into my favourite class!" Lame!

233	Andhaira	2011-05-30	This was arguably the weakest episode of this season (yet). Tywin's introduction was off. It was a bad idea to have him skin a stag, symbolism be damned. Tywin Lannister does NOT get his hands dirty. Period. 
Ned's betrayal was ok. Glad they showed the Hound killing Ned's men. I just hope that we see Selmy fight in the next episode, instead of just hearing about it.
234	Mad Queen	2011-05-30	Tywin Lannister does NOT get his hands dirty. Period.I agree. He sends Gregor Clegane and Walder Frey to do his butchering for him. 'Too proud to shit.'

235	NW Deserter	2011-05-30	Tywin Lannister does NOT get his hands dirty. Period. Apparently we came away from the books with drastically different ideas of Tywin's character.
236	shadow of death	2011-05-30	Baelish has as much designs on the Iron Throne as anyone else. Heck this was even illustrated a couple of episodes with him standing and staring at the empty throne. He doesn't have much money.... and NO army.... but he does have incredible sway over weak willed women. He is marrying (and murdering) his way to many lands and titles. Obviously Sansa and the North is next for him. I imagine after that it could be Asha Greyjoy.I think in the end Arya runs him through... at least I hope so!I think in the end it will be Sansa that takes care of Littlefinger.  She has been getting smarter and smarter in every book.  She will become a very good "player" of the game just by watching littlefinger.  His love for her will blind him and eventually she will want revenge.
237	QueenOfThorns	2011-05-30	Maester Luwin constantly owns Theon every episode with one-liners, I love it."And failed rebellions.""Are the two mutually exclusive in your experience?"LOL.I liked Jon in the books but in the show he's a whinny little dick.His father is fighting for his life and all Jon can say is, "Wah, wah, I didn't get into my favourite class!" Lame!I agree.  I think the decision to age the characters is very troublesome in this area.  Jon is, what, fourteen in GoT?  The whininess in the books is appropriate for that age, but when they add about 5 years to his character in the show, he comes across as a prick.
238	The Brandon Stark	2011-05-30	I agree.  I think the decision to age the characters is very troublesome in this area.  Jon is, what, fourteen in GoT?  The whininess in the books is appropriate for that age, but when they add about 5 years to his character in the show, he comes across as a prick.Disagree completely. First he finds out the Wall is place full of robbers, rapists and elderly men. Not exactly the honor he was expecting. He deals with it, makes friends, accepts his role to only have it once again pulled out from under him. He should be a ranger, not a servant. Even at nineteen, still tough to swallow. And he gets over that quick enough too.
239	NW Deserter	2011-05-30	I think some of you forgot what it was like to be a young adult. In modern society, 19 is the age where you feel like you can take on the world and be invincible, and Jon is like that too. His first big life lesson just hit him and knocked him down a peg, and with the ego of 19-year-old being what it is, that's a heavy blow. If anything, Jon's aging up makes his behavior even more realistic, or at least in terms of modern society.

A 19-year-old should know to ask uncle Benjen more about the wall before agreeing to it.  A 14-year-old would have a hard time letting go of his perceptions (kind of like Sansa) even if he's told the truth of life on the wall.  Additionally, in the book, we see the best of Jon Snow when he arranges for an early oathtaking for Sam, and a steward position.  We don't see that maturity in the chronologically more-mature Jon Snow on screen.

I don't think it's necessary at all to show him in King's Landing, it's already been established he's there for prisoners. He will still show up at the right moment like in the book, and it will be explained why he didn't leave earlier. Arya and Syrio just had a scene last episode and will certainly have a scene next episode, there's really no reason in my opinion for this episode to have them also; it would have messed with the pacing. I don't think that Robert's death needed more screen time, but I wish they had shown Ned and Robert being closer in that scene.

So what, he will still be going into battle with the LC. Jon didn't use his brain and think about it, he just whined because, "I'm the bastard, I'm better at swords and riding a horse than any of you, it's not fair!" Grow up you brat. It's the Night's Watch, it's not a vacation.
243	NW Deserter	2011-05-30	he just whined because, "I'm the bastard, I'm better at swords and riding a horse than any of you, it's not fair!" Grow up you brat. It's the Night's Watch, it's not a vacation.Well yeah, that's the whole point. He thought being a bastard of a high lord was tough, when in reality he was well-loved by just about everyone (except Cat), well fed, trained by the best in the North, safe, and generally pretty coddled. Now that he's in a more "typical" environment for a common bastard, he has to adjust his worldviews a lot. The whole point is that he is a brat initially.
244	Arya The Assassin	2011-05-30	Overall a good episode, although not as exciting as episode 6, I think.Cool:The introduction of Tywin Lannister. I was looking forward to seeing Charles Dance as Tywin, and I wasn't disappointed. I also liked the way the scene was directed: Instead of having a static scene with two actors standing (or sitting for that matter), they had Tywin skin a stag (which, incidentally, also represents the sigil of House Baratheon -- the symbolic overtones are clear) while he talked with his son. My only criticism is that after reading the books I'd expected Tywin's first scene to be with Tyrion, not Jamie.Robert's deathbed scene. I've not been too ecstatic about Mark Addy's performance as the king, but I think he was quite good here.Ghost returns with the hand.James Cosmo as Jeor Mormont! He played a memorable character in Braveheart.Momoa's performance as Drogo announces his decision to invade Westeros.The last throne room scene. Nice cliffhanger.The set decoration and production design in general. It looks great.Not so cool:The 'lesbian' scene. The scene was too long and started to drag.  In general, I think Littlefinger is getting too much screentime. And  there's something about Aidan Gillen's take on Littlefinger that doesn't quite 'jibe' with me. The girl who plays Ros, Esme Bianco, is quite easy on the eyes, though, both with and without clothes.No Arya /sad.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />EDIT: Fixed typos

It also takes 9 months between conception and birth so it's even a strain to put him at the age of 17 (and if the speculations are true Jon was born after the war ended).Jon is obviously aged up 2-3 years, which is about the same as the rest of the children.

I'm just judging by facial hair LOL, and Robb seems older than 16-17 in the show as well.  Ned Stark seems to have been aged at least 10 years (supposedly 34-ish in the book).  I don't think the aging is across-the-board 2-3 years.   Dany seems to have been aged more than 2-3 years as well.  I don't think the show can be held to the same hardcore chronology that the books can.  Jon Snow, to me, looks older than 16-17 in the show.  I believe the actor who plays him is mid-20s, so whatever age they say Jon Snow is in the series, he looks like a full-grown man, so should not be acting like a child in my eyes at least, which is probably why his whininess seems so inappropriate to me.  In that case, it's a casting error, but since I like the dude playing him (and he's easy on the eyes LOL) I'll let it slide /smile.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />

247	legba11	2011-05-30	Tywin has lesser people do foul deeds.  Butchering an animal you hunted and killed is no such task.  
Getting your hands dirty can have two meanings:
1. Doing the hard work necessary.  We use this expression all the time in school as a positive thing.  Tywin definetly does this.  Jaime was unwilling to do this in regards to Tyrion's abduction.
2. Doing immoral or criminal acts.  Tywin does not do this.  He has others do it for him.  Jaime did this when he attacked Ned on the streets.
Jaime has failed on both regards (in Tywin's view).  This is establishing his relationship with his children.  They all want the love and respect of the great Tywin Lannister.  Sadly, they all see the failed reflections of themselves when he looks at them.  Tywin loved two people and now one of them is dead.
248	Faint	2011-05-30	What was changed?  Cersei got one of Ned's lines, I think, but other than that, it was nearly word for word from the book? They basically did away with Cersei offering herself to Ned.I think this is problematic in many respects, none more so than it makes Cersei appear to be wholly faithful to Jaime when that isn't even the case back in AGoT.  It's clear very early on that she is willing to use her body for advancement even then.  It makes me worry about her character going forward as well.  I'm starting to question whether she will sleep with Lancel in the show and so forth.  Part of me thinks the writers wanted viewers to sympathize with her and including the offer to Ned would have made her seem like a whore but I think it has now go to the point where they're fundamentally changing who the character is.  Not that she's a whore, because I've never thought of her like that, but that's she willing to do whatever it takes to achieve her objectives and in the male dominated society she lives in, using her body is one of the few weapons allowed to her.Edit: Cersei is one of my favorite characters, perhaps even my very favorite, so I tend to focus in on her to the exclusion of others.  As many have pointed out, it's not even clear she is the most changed character from the books.

250	Ghost of Crackclaw	2011-05-30	I must say, the mileage we're getting out of non-standard scenes has been tremendous thus far. They've expanded the vision of the books in elegant and surprising ways much of the time.
But as far as I'm concerned, Aidan Gillen can go hang. I didn't think I'd be ready to dislike any of the actors this early on, and he started out initially promising. But his interpretation of Littlefinger--and I'm not even talking about the writing, just the delivery--has fallen so very flat. This episode in particular sealed it for me.

252	Regina	2011-05-30	Pros
-Dany/Dothraki scenes
-scenes at the wall (YAY GHOST! /thumbsup.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':thumbsup:' /> )
-Seeing the long shot of all the Lannister tents.  This gave a nice sense of a large number of people having been gathered, which we could have used more in some earlier episodes (Dany's wedding, Hand's tourney).
-Seeing Tywin, although I was taken out of the scene while trying to decide if he'd butcher his own kill or not.  I still haven't decided about that, lol.
-Luwin pawning Theon.  I was initially against having yet another Winterfell scene focus so much on Theon, but Luwin's crushing one-liner more than made up for it.
Cons
-I felt like Robert's last scene went by too quickly, and that we didn't see enough of the bond between Robert and Ned.  It would have been nice to keep the part where Ned reassures his dying friend that at least he did better than Aerys.
-I get what they were trying to do with Littlefinger and Roz's scene, but it was not one of the better sex-position scenes, imo.  I don't feel like we learned new information, so the time spent felt wasted.  And I think it was Kal that pointed out that showing more of Littlefinger's motives next week, AFTER he betrays Ned, would be better.
253	Chirios	2011-05-30	Are you gonna say something clever? Go on, say something clever.^Favourite quote from the episode.
254	Jaxom 1974	2011-05-30	Sigh. You guys are a bunch of wet blankets. I thoroughly enjoyed the Tywin-Jaime scene. For the record, Mya: I loved that scene.  My only small concern was the location, as it seems to have been in Tywin's tent.  And to a lesser extent the timing.  Preparing for a war...amazing how quickly Tywin had his forces marshalled, I'm re-reading the book and it feels different on the show...almmost as if he was riding to King's Landing before Tyrion was taken...preparing for war and taking the time to personally skin a deer seems slightly odd...That being said, the scene radiated Tywin's strength. Couple people have pointed out how bad Renly's casting is and how changed he is from the books.  I agree 100% with this.I think I've found Renly to be my biggest cating/character developing issue.  He has none of the self confidence of the novels and the added scene of him and Loras just took away even more of the characters ambiguity and potential...

I'm re-reading the first book and Littlefinger is dropping these great lines everywhere. He isn't quite as entertaining in the tv show as in the books, although I don't have anything against Gillen.The sex scene was a bit unfortunate, like several others I would have preferred his betrayal to come as a bit more of a surprise, but ah well..

Not the best of the season, but certainly not the worst; it maintains the quality level of the last few episodes, all of which have exceeded my expectations. The Littlefinger/Roz scene was whatever. I haven't warmed up to her, and Littlefinger is not dear enough to my heart to redeem such a pointless scene. Tyrion, on the other hand, I can handle -- even when he's having an orgy on Jaime's dime, as in the strange brothel scene we saw in the first episode.I thought Robert's last few scenes were well-done. It might not have been adapted exactly as I'd imagined, but it was powerful nonetheless. Mark Addy did a wonderful job in that role, and while he might have beat us over the head with the "former college football player" cliche, I think it worked. As a previous poster said, the bit about him being better than Aerys would have been nice, but so far there has been no mention of Aerys Targaryen in anything but the poorest light. This is good framing because right now, the Mad King is considered a villain absolutely, and I don't think any of the non-reader audience would conceive of comparing the two rulers at this point. As the series progresses into the War of the Five Kings, when the common folk start reminiscing about how much better things are under Targaryen rule, Aerys will be put into perspective. The fact that he wasn't always crazy, and in fact was at one point a competent and well-liked monarch, will add another delicious layer to all of the scandal preceding Robert's rebellion.Ned's little gamble for power came across just the way it should have -- too little, too late. The betrayal of Littlefinger came as no surprise to us, of course, but I wonder how many viewers saw this coming. It made me feel the way I did when I was reading A Game of Thrones for the first time. Joffrey was perfectly petulant, though the Hound looked kind of stupid when he pulled his sword out. Reminded me of a villain from Power Rangers or something. Still waiting and hoping for the Hound to become the Hound.No Tyrion this episode, which was a bummer, but he'll show up soon enough. I really hope they show how he wins the mountain clans to his side. I can't imagine why they wouldn't.Tywin satisfied me. He wasn't completely bald, which I always thought was a very interesting part of his character -- how he doesn't believe in half-measures. Also, butchering his own stag was kind of silly. The book Tywin would have never done such a thing, but this Tywin seems to be a slightly different character. He's still an antagonist, power-player, strategist, kingmaker and a man who's respected and feared, but he smacks of Randyll Tarly. I enjoyed his and Jaime's scene, though.So, in short: Renly was better in this episode, Littlefinger was worse (his forceful delivery of his lines leaves none of the wry, smirking cunning of the book Littlefinger intact). Jason Momoa as Khal Drogo was impressive, at least visually and emotionally. The Dothraki language sounds kind of silly -- it's like Klingon; they didn't bother with the more in-depth structure of linguistics, but seemingly wrote out the lines in English and then translated them word-for-word, so everything (syntax wise) comes in the same order. That's a bit of a stretch, considering how languages evolve. The Wall scenes were alright, saved largely by the actor who plays Samwise Samwell, despite his admission of wanting to be a fat Harry Potter. Mormont's speech was strong, the Oath was good and Ghost came back, looking very impressive. The Cersei/Ned Godswood scene fell kind of flat for me. Where's the seductress? So far she's just a jaded strategist, without all the devious charm.

257	KarentheUnicorn	2011-05-30	I just don't quite get Littlefinger telling his business to his hired help. And not even his hired help, the whores he's telling really just showed up at his place for a job. We saw MissRedHeadWhore on the road she she's only just gotten there lately.
If it was one of his whores he's had around for years I might say maybe he'd hint at or give his history...but this new girl shows up looking for a job and he's going to tell her
he's got a revengo-metor going on a northern lord(s), and his past history with them and even some of his innter motivations.
Does that even really make sense? He's dealing in secrets and spies and I'd think he'd keep hints of his real motives close to the vest, not just tell random whore #1 and #2 who are looking for a job this histories about himself and even get close if not outright telling his plans/motives.
My complaint really has nothing to do with the girl on girl action, it's more that I find it hard to believe LF would just randomly tell this unknown chicks his business.
258	Knight Of The North	2011-05-30	I think Littlefinger is being played by Aiden Gillian, and portrayed through the writing, as abit more of a sleazy politician, perhaps in the vein of Lord Mandelson rather than Lord Baelish.For reference, here's a picture I think perfectly illustrates the book Petyr Baelish: He's handsome, to a degree, he's charming, he's abit sleazy, and he never, ever, ever plays to lose. The TV Baelish seems to be abit more wormy, more obviously cowardly, less like a prancing master of the Courtly Game, and more a backroom bureaucrat fixing things behind the scenes; ala, Varys.
259	Ellroy	2011-05-30	Good episode, I liked it a lot: it's one of the best in the series so far.
I loved the scene with Jaime and Tywin. And I disliked the LF's brothel scene.
But my biggest regret is the "you win or you die" scene. With the TV Cersei, a charachter that misses most of the viciousness and the evilness of her book counterpart, the scene lost a lot of its dramatic impact. Mind, it's still good, but I hoped for something better.

260	VikingLegion	2011-05-30	Apparently we came away from the books with drastically different ideas of Tywin's character.Strange isn't it?  I had no problem seeing him "get his hands dirty".  To me, he reads as a man's man who will push to excel in all things - not some paper-pushing beaurocratic puppetmaster who refuses to engage in the action.  If anything, I see him as quite the opposite - a man who believes that nobody could possibly ever do the job as well as himself, so he will take matters into his own hands when that is appropriate.  Of course when large scale betrayals and other ugly business is involved, he'll utilize a lesser mind to make sure all the heat falls on his scapegoats.In our world, I envision Tywin as a high-powered CEO who kicks ass in the board room for most of the day.  But in his off time he's got black belts in multiple martial arts styles, can kick the crap out of men half his age, and still have enough energy to go home and do his own oil change on his self-restored vintage car out in the garage - because he knows some pimply faced kid at the local Jiffy Lube won't do as good a job as he will.  He's the millionaire that still brings a bag lunch to work everyday, because it's the practical thing to do.Maybe I'm way off, but that's just the Tywin I envisioned, and why the stag scene resonated perfectly for me.  Good convo though, it's interesting to me to see how a character can be interpreted so differently.  I guess none of us will be more "right" than the others.
261	Tywin's bastard	2011-05-30	My bad, in my original post I said he seemed aged "about 5 years" and everyone ran with it, so I did too.  I'm just judging by facial hair LOL, and Robb seems older than 16-17 in the show as well.  Ned Stark seems to have been aged at least 10 years (supposedly 34-ish in the book).  I don't think the aging is across-the-board 2-3 years.   Dany seems to have been aged more than 2-3 years as well.  I don't think the show can be held to the same hardcore chronology that the books can.  Jon Snow, to me, looks older than 16-17 in the show.  I believe the actor who plays him is mid-20s, so whatever age they say Jon Snow is in the series, he looks like a full-grown man, so should not be acting like a child in my eyes at least, which is probably why his whininess seems so inappropriate to me.  In that case, it's a casting error, but since I like the dude playing him (and he's easy on the eyes LOL) I'll let it slide /smile.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />Yes, Kit Harrington was 23 when the show was shot. A big part of the actors on the show are older than their characters, and it goes for all the children. Speaking of children I was mainly referring to the Stark children when I said they are aged up 2-3 years. Dany is aged up 4 years if I recall correctly and you are right in that the people in Ned's generation are aged up about 10 years. As for the chronology I actually did put it in the show's own chronology as 17 years is what the show says, while it's shorter in the books. The remark about Jon probably being born after the war was a side thing, which is why I put it in parenthesis.As for Jon being how he is, I think it works fine as he's had a chip on his shoulder from being treated unfairly and has never had any chance to step out of that shadow until he joins the Watch because Cat would never be fine with him getting a decent position at Winterfell. I think that works just as well in his late teens as people have held grudges on life for far longer than that.
262	Tywin's bastard	2011-05-30	Tywin satisfied me. He wasn't completely bald, which I always thought was a very interesting part of his character -- how he doesn't believe in half-measures.

He's still an antagonist, power-player, strategist, kingmaker and a man who's respected and feared, but he smacks of Randyll Tarly. I enjoyed his and Jaime's scene, though.This isn't directed towards you but a general point on Tywin skinning the stag. Nobles hunt for sport, not for food, and dressing your kill is part of the hunting game. I can definitely see the highborn doing that to their own kills as part of the whole manliness ritual hunting represents for them. Tywin could very well be one that hunts for the ritualistic sport of it, rather than just to kill something (like Robert). As you say, Tywin doesn't believe in half-measures, which tells us he wouldn't skip part of the whole hunting experience when he decided to hunt.As for getting his hands dirty, that's more likely figuratively speaking than literary because you don't get to be as fit as Tywin seems to be at his age if you aren't a person that takes part in a good deal of physical activities.So to go and say that the book Tywin would have never done such a thing is pretty much committing the fallacy of putting forth opinion as fact.
263	Steel_Wind	2011-05-30	They basically did away with Cersei offering herself to Ned.I think this is problematic in many respects, They made that choice when they aged up Cersei as she is portrayed in the books and decided that they would not cast a bombshell in the role. Book Cersei was a breathtaking babe of a woman that all men lusted after.  TV Cersei is attractive woman to be sure, but she is no bombshell. When they decided to cast Lena Headey as Cersei, they decided that TV Cersei would be less sexual in terms of how the character was portrayed on screen. I think that has been clear from the outset.Lena Headey is an attractive woman and I don't at all want to be taken to mean that I don't think she is. I repeat, she is an attractive woman. But she just isn't the kind of woman that is going to make most men forget themselves in the way that GRRM wrote the character.Trying to add that MILF layer to Cersei at this stage with Ned in the godswood would have seemed forced and entirely unbelievable. They wisely didn't go there, imo.

I can definitely see the highborn doing that to their own kills as part of the whole manliness ritual hunting represents for them. Exactly. Field dressing a deer is seen as a nobleman's task; indeed, to kill any deer was always a right reserved to the nobility in the middle and late medieval periods. Being caught at "stealing" a deer from a nobleman's forest was a crime invariably punishable by death.In contrast, slaughtering and skinning a domestiacted animal like a pig, sheep, goat or cow would defnitely be a peasant's task and would be beneath a man like Tywin Lannister.It is a distinction with a difference.
265	Mad Queen	2011-05-30	If he were in Casterly Rock, if he had gone hunting for sport, I could see him skinning his kill as part of a ritual. But he is in the middle of a war, his men are attacking the riverlands, Jaime is about to fight against Edmure and so on. Shouldn't he have left hunting and cooking to a servant and be reading maps, discussing strategy with his men or practicing swordplay with them?
266	Ran	2011-05-30	It's not really a war at this stage. A small party of men have been sent into the riverlands. He's chilling, waiting for the time to be ripe to go forward and begin the real hostilities. Until then, he's in a holding pattern. So why not do the sort of things nobles actually do?
267	legba11	2011-05-30	Tywin is not in the middle of a war (yet). He is preparing for one as he is the type of leader who sees these things coming.  He is sending part of his host with Jaime to start a war.  Chances are he and many of his fellow nobles were quite bored, just sitting around waiting for other bannermen to arrive.  Hunting for the sake of food and morale is likely one of the most important things they could do.  It's not like they had strategy to plan yet.
268	Wras	2011-05-30	It's not really a war at this stage. A small party of men have been sent into the riverlands. He's chilling, waiting for the time to be ripe to go forward and begin the real hostilities. Until then, he's in a holding pattern.

I think that works just as well in his late teens as people have held grudges on life for far longer than that.I would agree with this. Incidentally, do you know how old Jon is when he becomes Lord Commander of the Night's Watch in the books? It would certainly be hard to sell him as a Lord Commander in the tv-series, if the actor was even younger than Kit.

270	Ser Warpechowski	2011-05-30	Am I the only person in the world who really, really loved the Littlefinger sexposition scene?  I don't care whether he would/would not talk that frankly to any of his whores, and I don't care that it was more (oh, no!) sex.  Littlefinger knows about screwing people over, and making them like it, and that's what that scene was about for me.Liked the Tywin scene, though not as much as the Littlefinger scene.  That looked like a real stag he was really skinning; if it was, I sure hope they ate it!  (And did they have to pay him extra to do that?  Ew!)That scene was bad. They reduced one of the most interesting characters to a boogie man from fairy tales.The guy is suposed to be talking of the thing that drives his, that gives him strengh while a bunch of whores perform lesbian sex and barely hear what he says.It was childish. I thought HBO was so good because they could show anything, but once they add a stupid scene just to show sex it makes their freedom seem stupid.
271	The Anti-Targ	2011-05-30	30,000 men is a ridiculously large number of soldiers to have at Jaime's disposal considering Tywin will be retaining a large host under his own command.
Makes the threat of Dothraki invasion seem rather managable if it's only 40,000 and one House can muster a larger army. Jaime taking 5-10,000 would have made the Dothraki horde seem more horde-ish.
However as there are Houses who would still like to see the Targs restored I suppose those houses knowing Dany was returning with 40,000 of her own would embolden those Targ loyalists (Dorne at the very least) to rise up and rebel, thus swelling their ranks. We also know that at least some houses have no great qualms about raping and pillaging, so havign the Dotraki do it wouldn't be all shock horror war crime to Westerosi sensibilities.
It's all academic of course, given how the book ends but still One armyu of 40,000 doesn't seem like much of a threat after the Tywin/Jaime scene.
272	Jaime L	2011-05-30	I must say, the mileage we're getting out of non-standard scenes has been tremendous thus far. They've expanded the vision of the books in elegant and surprising ways much of the time.Yeah, one thing that's clear is the HBO series knows the characters. Think they've already pulled off a Robert-Cersei relationship that is more rueful and nuanced than the portrayal we get to see in the books. Think the Tywin-Jaime scene was also a necessary scene because it not only cuts right through Jaime's typical bluster but it reveals the principled hardness of Tywin. The series is committed to showing, rather than telling...I presume this is why we still haven't had any flashbacks. And what's the alternative? Tyrion meeting up with Tywin at his camp and as the camera pans in on Tyrion, he narrates Wonder Years style about how Tywin wasn't a man who believed in half measures...? Show us how the man cows his Golden Boy son and then be entertained as he doesn't bat an eyelash when his other dwarf son rides up as king of the mountain clans. I think I've found Renly to be my biggest cating/character developing issue.  He has none of the self confidence of the novels and the added scene of him and Loras just took away even more of the characters ambiguity and potential...Is it wrong when he declared "I should be king" to Ned, I chuckled? Was definitely a Yeah, you go ahead and do that moment. The sense I get from the TV series is that if Renly is Ned's last great hope in Kings Landing, he was fucked from the beginning.

When Robert mentions the number 40 000 he's just making a hypothetical scenario (although making the relevant point about that Westerosi armies aren't all made up of real soldiers, while the Dothraki are all warriors). When he and Eddard first discusses a possible invasion Robert tells Ned that it's said that Drogo has 100 000 men in his horde.

When he and Eddard first discusses a possible invasion Robert tells Ned that it's said that Drogo has 100 000 men in his horde.Adding onto this, it's gently implied by Robert's speech to Cersei that the Dothraki could probably beat the Westerosi Armies on an open field, numbers being not a problem. I don't have a transcript to hand, but he pretty much states that they'd hide in the castles instantly.Also, a Dothraki Army is ALL horseback. Most of a Westerosi Army is untrained arrow fodder.
277	Maid of Styrner Stuff	2011-05-30	I loved, loved, loved this episode!! Had to comment  with this, my first post ever.   I've adored Charles Dance, a truly elegant man and fine actor,  for years. Makes NCW appear a callow  youth. (With BROWN hair.) What surprised me most was the  similarity in the appearance of these two actors who could so easily be related  in RL. Perfect casting IMHO. And perfect acting in a well-written scene. Bravo  to the writers and actors. To ALL of them, all excellent.   Re: LF'S Brothel Lesson Â<U+0096> I've become resigned and cynical  about the abundance of noodlety and T & A in this TV series. We must pay the  HBO piper and the piper has a rep to keep as a premiere channel. In the overall  scheme, it is a small price to pay, and may even lighten a dark series and/or  provide the occasional puerile interest. And in this scene, by combining the  sucky sex with needed (??) exposition, sex as background music appears less  offensive. Yes, I'm sick of her, too, but Roz fills the role of the Other Actor  w/Distracting Frontal Charms when a male character needs to expound without  context. That premiere scene with Tyrion's Bed o' Boobies, then the subsequent  and various floppy parts, and now a fleeting (fleeing) twat makes me think the  sex in this series will be routinely offered more than in the books, though  tastefully placed. One can only hope.   What I found strange, as someone previously mentioned, was why  LF had his Pimp Headquarters in the brothel seraglio, and why his madam/manager  wasn't handling the newbie instruction when LF's day job is Crown CFO. He claims  several prosperous establishments. Tantamount to finding Cersei counting kettles  in the kitchen while she righteously explains to the scullery personnel why she  loathes her dwarf brother.   But I can still see the sense of Lord Tywin butchering his own  deer, a relaxing way to end a successful hunt, and I imagine he hunts from  horseback with hounds, not stumbling through the woods on two legs like Robert  and his buds, waiting for the boar to find HIM. Surprise! All that was missing  to put a Pythonesque touch to the scene was (as previously and hilariously  suggested) Lancel clapping his coconuts together. Yes, I got that,  too!   One small mention that's been already made on the locked  discussion: "Could have cared less"....... As an American, I despise this crappy  grammar which identifies the speaker as 1.) a contemporary Yank, and B.) a  moron. We need no reminders that Jaime's a callow jerk. Let's hope the producers  correct this before the episode is enshrined in the DVD.  I am so grateful for this series and will dutifully pay my  dues to HBO if they will continue to produce it. At most any price it is a gift  to have received it in my lifetime, almost as much as are the source pages  penned by the genius GRRM. Just freakin' thrilling!!!! I couldn't ask for a  better, more brilliant production, and I feel craven to be whining about any of  it. I don't buy DVDs, but I'll buy those when they're offered.
278	Jaime L	2011-05-30	How dare you, sir. Renly is majestic:http://img707.images...nlymajestic.jpgI have completely misjudged the man. I don't care what the books say. This is the dude that's winning the Iron Throne.
279	smidget25	2011-05-30	I think I've found Renly to be my biggest cating/character developing issue.  He has none of the self confidence of the novels and the added scene of him and Loras just took away even more of the characters ambiguity and potential...I completely disagree. As somebody who barely registered who Renly was in the first book (although I did come to like him in the second), I feel the change is really refreshing. It's nice not to have a man who goes around swinging a sword, speaking of war and/or screwing people over. The scene with Loras set up him approaching Ned in a way that it never did in the book - which came completely out of the left field when I read it. It actually gave him some genuine motivation.And in regards to their potential, I think it sets up a nice dynamic for their relationship that can be developed in season 2. The series is severely lacking couples who actually seem to care about each other (particularly after the whole Ned thing at the end of GOT), and so I can't wait to see it unfold. I felt the scene has added to both characters, who are very much in the background in the books.
280	Tywin's bastard	2011-05-30	Doesn't Viserys and/or Jorah also say 40,000 at one point?Yes, you're probably be correct on that one as it does ring a bell. Still most of the Dothraki are probably near the elite of the Westerosi armies, given that they live for war and are all mounted.How dare you, sir. Renly is majestic:http://img707.images...nlymajestic.jpgRobert was visually very "majestic" in his prime and we all know how much that meant when it came to his qualities as a king. Being a big, strong and handsome guy is quite far down on the list on what makes a good king and regardless of his qualities the only ones supporting Renly are the ones with a ton to gain. What we see in ACOK is Renly going around feasting with everyone supporting him, without caring that he gives his enemies time, so it doesn't seem like he was that different from Robert after all (Robert the king that is, Robert was definitely a better conquerer), although the one in the show might be.

281	theMountainGoat	2011-05-30	Gonna be quicker to list the things I did like this week:
1. Liked the opening scene with Tywin butchering the stag. Charles Dance perfectly cast.
2. You Win or You Die. Great scene.
3. All the bits with Dany this week and Drogo's awesome speech.
4. The final scene played out perfectly.
But I fucking hated every single other scene this week. I know I should not let minor nitpicks bother me but they do because they make the show less good than it should be. And as for Littlefinger's revealing far too much exposition scene with pointless gratuitous lesbian sex. For. Fuck. Sake. I'm sure it's already been discussed to death here but man that scene made me livid. It definitely ruined the way I feel about this episode.
282	Ser Kevan Raley	2011-05-30	The tension is ramping up. From now on things will irrevocably definitely change. Some notes:It was a somewhat bold move to have an episode without favourites such as Tyrion and Arya, but it held up nonetheless.Come to think of it, there was no Catelyn, Bran or Sansa either.The vast Lannister host looked very nifty. They are obviously preparing for war and a march towards the yet unnamed Riverrun.Very cool showing Lord Tywin gutting a stag, even if it perhaps was a bit of too obvious in its symbolism.I liked Charles Dance as Tywin, even if he didn't have the huge sideburns.Clearly the Lannister name, its standing and reputation, is all that matters to Tywin. And the thing is, he's not really wrong. Had they not taken action, no one would respect their house in the future.I also liked the talk between Ned and Cersei, even if it was not in the godswood. But Ned is just so stupid and honourable spilling the beans like that. No change from the book. It is also evident that it was this event that prompted Cersei's action, not Sansa telling her. Sansa wasn't even in this episode. People blame poor Sansa for a lot of things but generally Ned gets of the hook just because he's honourable, whereas Sansa is deemed a selfish bitch. I'm not excusing what Sansa did, but the real fault lies with Ned himself."When you play the game of thrones you either win or die!" Heh!I'm getting a tad annoyed with Roz (or is it Ros?). It was obvious she was going to end up in King's Landing as one of Littlefinger's whores, and lo and behold there she is, making gratuitous lesbian sex for no reason. Just another excuse to have Littlefinger retell his story about his childhood infatuation and duel - and of course showing some nakedness. Now why would he even tell his whores something that personal and humiliating?  A bit of foreshadowing though when he says he's going to f**k them, which he promptly does at the end of the episode. Still, Ros is pretty hot!Another added scene was the one with Theon and Osha that was actually an infodump about the Iron Islands and the Greyjoys.I liked Osha telling Theon that he was a southerner because everything south of the Wall is the south to her.I also liked Maester Luwin's line to Theon that being a guest and a prisoner is not mutually exclusive. Heh!It was a pity that all the hunting scene we got was the unsatisfactory one when King Robert and his small entourage walked in the woods in the previous episode. Now Robert is just back after his fatal injury. I get it would have been hard to film the actual wild boar incident, but seeing at least part of the hunt would have been nice. For that matter, Robert died off screen, which was also a bit disappointing, especially considering the big role he had up until then.I'm not sure why Varys apparently sent assassins to kill Daenerys when it was established that he conspired with Illyrio on behalf the Targaryens.I was expecting Dany to look a lot more pregnant. She's barely showing it here.Samwell has certainly grown (no pun intended) as a character. He's matured both when he speaks up in front of everyone about swearing his oath before the old gods and when he tells Jon Snow that it is a good thing being named the Lord Commander's steward.Still, if being groomed for command, Jon would have been better off getting some ranger experience before serving the LC. Well, at least he will get that in the future, although in a different manner.Yeah, Ned was as stupid here as in the book when he refused Renly's offer to stick with Stannis.A wolf doesn't bark, yet here we can clearly hear Ghost barking as he runs off when they come across the Wall. Maybe direwolves do?They do a nice job inventing the Dothraki language. Will this be the new "Klingon" among obsessive fans?Something seemed a bit off with Aidan Gillen's portrayal of Littlefinger in this episode. His delivery didn't feel as "real" as it has before.I had forgotten that Littlefinger actually pulled a knife at Ned's throat. It seemed out of character for him to get so physical, but then it's right there in the book as well.I wonder what non-readers thought about this surprising turn of events. Did they, like Ned, trust Littlefinger? Were they surprised at Robert's death and the failure of Ned's "coup"? Poor viewers, they ain't seen nothing yet!
283	Ser Warpechowski	2011-05-30	One of the theme's in the series is that honour gets you nowhere. Men with honour only really find success when they team up with unhonourable people... see Jon with Samwell, Stannis with Davos, and Tyrion with Bronn.But having no honour bears heavily on some people. Jamie eventually turns on Cersei in part because he cannot handle being held without honour by most men that have it. It was a bit understated in their brief scene together but Barristan despised Jamie for stabbing Aerys in the back.Good lesson there.Even if youÂ´re honorable, you need someone to get his hands dirty.It is the truth in real life and I guess its even more important in fantasy, specially one so violent.Fortunaly most characters in GoT are shades of grey, and that is why the series is so good.And I agree that LittlefingerÂ´s actor isnt doing a very good job. Maybe he had pointers but his character is nowhere as interesting as in the book. Of course, he had the unfortunate mission to apear in a stupid sex scene, but...

284	Isabella Stark	2011-05-30	A point I haven't seen anyone comment on (at least not in this thread, haven't read the other one):
It's fine that we missed the bit about Jon intervening on Sam's behalf and suggesting that he'd be a good assistant to Maester Aemon, but we haven't gotten any sense that Mormont observed Jon's leadership talents, etc.  So I didn't think it was clear how Mormont spotted Jon's potential.  The way it happened in this episode, it seems like he's singling out Jon simply because of his family.  It would have been nice to get something of Mormont observing Jon being smart, a leader, something that indicates he'd be a good lord high commander.
Otherwise, I thought it was a great episode.
Did not like Littlefinger's brothel scene. The grauitous sex was just annoying and I think it telegraphed way too much about Littlefinger's character and motivations.
Really liked the Tywin- Jaime scene.  
Drogo was great.  
The entertainment blog on the Vanity Fair website picked up on something I hadn't noticed (despite reading these books 3 times)-  in this episode, both Mormonts spotted the leadership potential for Dany and Jon.  hmmmm. The first time I read GOT, I didn't even pick up on "Old Bear" Mormont being Jorah's father.    It still hadn't occurred to be that their relations might be anything more than a coincidence in the story, but now I'm wondering....
285	Landless Knight	2011-05-30	Roz's boobs have had more screen time than all of the direwolves combined.
286	Wras	2011-05-30	With regards to Littlefinger, it's just in the way he talks for me. The lines he's saying are actually fine, but the voice is grating. It sounds so fake and toneless. Littlefinger should be like this, but only sometimes. There needs to be a part of his character that opens others to trust him, otherwise he simply wouldn't survive. I think he's playing all schemer and no manipulator, if that makes sense.
287	Shepherd6	2011-05-30	Agree ^^^ About Roz's boobs having more screentime than the Dwolves. And it is a shame, too. Suspect most non-readers have forgotten about them/don't realise their signifignace. 
On the whole, enjoyed this episode, but have been really pleased in general so far. To answer the question posed by Ser Kevan in regards to non readers and how they took the final throneroom scene: Watched with a non reader/avid watcher and he was blown away by LF's betrayal and Ned's failed coup. He loves Ned though, and has no idea what's coming for him mwaa ha ha. Renly: still disappointing. Dany: Nicely done, shown to be maturing as a character. Drogo: Awesome. Brothel scene: flogged to death, not going to weigh in. 
I know they can't put in every little thing from the books, but was no one else sorry not to see Jon appealing to Maester Aemon on Sam's behalf? Would have added much needed dimension to his character

288	wandarah	2011-05-30	As far as boobs go, I personally believe those of Ros to be very significant indeed. Stand out performances by them both so far.
289	Landless Knight	2011-05-30	It's interesting how the show joins the dots, where the books require readers to do it themselves. The implicit is replaced by the explicit.
Everybody seems to be a degree less devious. Even Littlefinger is more honestly untrustworthy than I remember him from the books. There's less ambiguity.
I liked the Tywin scene, even if the character wasn't how I imagined him. Once again he seemed more forthright and straightforward. He did come perilously close to calling Jaime a loser, whereas, as I recall from the novel, membership of the Kingsguard was regarded as a great honour.
Skinning the stag was a great idea. Symbolism, adding visual interest to the scene, and characterization - Tywin is harshly practical and not afraid to get his hands dirty.

The number of the entire horde (considering Drogo has more or less united most of the Dothraki) would be considerably larger.

All 40,000, and their horses too." So, Khal Drogo's tribe consists of around 40,000 riders, and I agree that the entire Dothraki horde would be considerably larger.

295	Rockroi	2011-05-30	I know this may sound strange, but I think there was a significant continuity error in the show.
Renly and Ned's scene is much like the book version, with Renly declaring that merely being the Lord Protector is not enough and that they should get Joff as far away from Cersei as possible.  Renly declares the obvious: the need to "strike now" and Ned insisting otherwise.  Nothing to note there.
Its just that about half way through the scene, and for no reason I can see, Ned asks, "What about Stannis?"  Renly then replies, in effect, why worry about the line of succession.
There's just one problem: Ned NEVER mentions that Stannis is the rightful heir at this point.  He never brings up Joffrey being a bastard of Jaime and Cersei- he never says a word about any of that and Renly NEVER implies that he is any bit the wiser.  If this is so- or even if its NOT so -why does Ned mention Stannis at all in any way?  There is no rumor afoot that Joff is not the heir; Renly is not declaring to usurp Joff because Joff is illegitimate; its not like the scene with LF where Ned says it all right from the start.  
I checked the book; in the book Stannis' name never comes up.  And with good reason; at that point Renly's attitude was far different; it was a far different character.  Also, there is no need, in the book, to mention Stannis- we already knew what Stannis entailed.  But the show makes a point of bringing up Stannis but in the context of THIS discussion, its a complete non sequitor.  
Why the hell did Ned even MENTION Stannis?  It makes no sense at all.

296	Wolfheart	2011-05-30	I'm still bothered by Jaimes hair color. His hair is supposed to be blonde like his siblings a nice shiny golden. Not a dark sandy blonde to brown.
To prove that David and Dan and whoever else dropped the ball here is a beautifully lit photo of Ned dueling Jaime. Both with near same hair color.http://winter-is-com...ion-06-1920.jpg
Now when you put Dinklage with his appropriately colored hair for Tyrion in the mix its quite a contrast. Even Headey and Joff*forget the actors name*.
297	Ser_Niall	2011-05-30	More comments:That heart tree face just looked stupid.  I half expected a squirrel to jump out of its mouth.Besides hitting us over the head with a metaphor, why was Tywin skinning a deer?  Doesn't seem like something very lordly to do.I agree.  The heart tree in Winterfell looked much better, but not complaining too much.  The oath scene was great, the actors who play Jon and Sam mesh well together.I'm assuming that Tywin is an avid hunter, like Robert.  He probably killed the deer, and he wants to skin it himself.  I wouldn't be surprised if Robert had survived his hunt, he would have skinned his boar himself.Overall, this was an ok episode.  Much needed plot advancement and characterization.  The Littlefinger whore house scene was unneeded.  I realize that we need to him to tell his background to someone since we can't get inside the characters heads, but the whole sex scene was over the top.  Especially given the fact that I went over to my parent's place to watch this with my dad, and my mother walks in right when this scene starts.  We both looked at each other with this "oh boy" look on our faces, and we're 30 and 59 /tongue.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />

301	Jajusha	2011-05-31	30,000 men is a ridiculously large number of soldiers to have at Jaime's disposal considering Tywin will be retaining a large host under his own command.Makes the threat of Dothraki invasion seem rather managable if it's only 40,000 and one House can muster a larger army. Jaime taking 5-10,000 would have made the Dothraki horde seem more horde-ish.However as there are Houses who would still like to see the Targs restored I suppose those houses knowing Dany was returning with 40,000 of her own would embolden those Targ loyalists (Dorne at the very least) to rise up and rebel, thus swelling their ranks. We also know that at least some houses have no great qualms about raping and pillaging, so havign the Dotraki do it wouldn't be all shock horror war crime to Westerosi sensibilities.It's all academic of course, given how the book ends but still One armyu of 40,000 doesn't seem like much of a threat after the Tywin/Jaime scene.We are talking about 40.000 Dothraki horsemen, not a regular 40.000 men mixed army. It would move like a locust plague. Any army that tried to face it had to do so in open field, if it stood ground on a defensible position, the horde would bypass it and keep looting.
302	The Anti-Targ	2011-05-31	We are talking about 40.000 Dothraki horsemen, not a regular 40.000 men mixed army. It would move like a locust plague. Any army that tried to face it had to do so in open field, if it stood ground on a defensible position, the horde would bypass it and keep looting.Doesn't matter. As the Russians said: Quantity has a quality of it's own. 40,000 horsemen vs 20 - 60,000 soldiers in each of the 7 kingdoms would soon lose a war of attrition with no hope of replenishing their numbers. No Jaime getting 30,000 men of his own made Robert's angst over a Dothraki invasion look ridiculous. It was very important for Roberts 5 vs 1 lesson mean that none of the 5 alone could field an army large enough to cause significant loss to the Dothraki. The Lannisters clearly have a large enough force to worry the Dothraki.Anyway I was RIGHT! The stag was real (see the inside Ep. 7 video) Whoever thought it would be possible to make a carcass and deer skin look that real really didn't look closely at how the muscles and skin moved when Charles Dance was doing the cutting and skinning. Props departments really don;t have the technology to make fake skin and muscle look that good. The guts were fake though, because you really couldn't run the risk of perforating the bowel during one of the 50 takes because that would make an unholy mess (though the smell ain't bad because it's only fermented grass); besides there just wasn't enough of it. A Stag that big would have more guts in it than Charles Dance could hope to lift out. They shoulda had him cut open the chest and remove a real set of lungs and heart. Or rather reach up through the diaphragm and do it. Made me hungry that scene. Mmmmm love venison leg steaks. I do hope they ate it, after 50 takes the meat would be well tender, but still safe to eat. Poor Jaime though having Tywin's hand on his neck after hving given his had a cursory wipe with a used rag.
303	Sijjvra	2011-05-31	After episode 6 this one was a let down. Mostly for whoregate. Even my husband was eyerolling pretty hard at that and said "yeah if I wanted to watch porn I'd just go watch porn."
I still think it's a bit stupid that we're expected to "enjoy" lesbian sex scenes when we all know that if we'd have gotten the same exact scene from Renly and Loras people would be throwing a huuuuge fit and cancelling their HBO, or worse. Double standards piss me off. And it's not that I have anything against lesbians at all, or even seeing some boobs, but the double standard thing...yeah. Plus, again, if people wanted to go watch porn, they'd go watch porn. This scene could have been more tastefully done and they dropped the ball on it and made it trashy.
And plus I couldn't hear Littlefinger over Ros' stupid moaning.  Ros needs to just go away, at least for a few episodes. I'd rather see more dire wolves than your rack again, thanks.
Anyway, I agree that the actor playing Littlefinger isn't doing a stellar job. Not rotten, but he's not at all as subtle, clever and as fun a character to try to figure out as he was in the books.
Barkgate? Yeah, a bit cheesy but I wasn't too worried - honestly at this point the "wolves" look so doglike I just...think of them as half-breed Stark wolves anyway, which is a bummer but... they're giving all the screen time to Ros so we never get to see the wolves much to begin with. T
he actor playing Sam is terrific - I like how he gives Sam a bit of humor here that he was lacking in the books. 
Why is Jaime's hair getting more and more brown? Glad I'm not the only one that noticed this.
Osha is great so far. Need more of her and less Ros, IMHO.  At least Osha's actually -in- the books and serves a real purpose other than tit-flashing. Loved how snarky she was to Theon.
Our HBO Cersei really isn't doing it for me. She's not got any of the fiery temper and coy mannerisms. It's like I'm watching a completely different character than what was in the books. 
Kid playing Joff is nailing it. Love to hate that character.
304	jellydonut	2011-05-31	'Barkgate'? Seriously? People expect a spitz dog breed to be taught not to bark? What should they do, tear the dog's throat out?
It's either barking or CGI wolves. I really, really doubt CGI wolves would look acceptable in any way.
305	legba11	2011-05-31	[*]I also liked the talk between Ned and Cersei, even if it was not in the godswood. But Ned is just so stupid and honourable spilling the beans like that. No change from the book. It is also evident that it was this event that prompted Cersei's action, not Sansa telling her. Sansa wasn't even in this episode. People blame poor Sansa for a lot of things but generally Ned gets of the hook just because he's honourable, whereas Sansa is deemed a selfish bitch. I'm not excusing what Sansa did, but the real fault lies with Ned himself.[*]I'm not sure why Varys apparently sent assassins to kill Daenerys when it was established that he conspired with Illyrio on behalf the Targaryens.[/list]Ned get trashed plenty. "Pigheaded, Worst play of The Game of Thrones" Most people empathasize with him as his fault is honor.Hatred of Sansa may be the closest thing to the fabled "Unifying Force of the the Internet" since hatred of Wesley Crusher.  Get used to it.  She is the enbodiment of every teenage girl sterotype we all hate, including the super-pretty girl who fawned over the obnoxious douche who drove a better car than us.Wasn't much of an assassin was he?  Not a Faceless man, some loser poison peddler who breaks out in hives when he has to give her the poison.  Hell, he didn't even recognize his mark as she walks up.  Worst assassin ever.  I think Varys knows how to hire a good assassin if he wants to.
306	Eddard house stark	2011-05-31	the sex scene was such a waste of screen time. shame on hbo for that garbage. littlefinger is played perfectly by baltimores corrupt mayor.i really admired ned in the books now he looks like a simpleton fool. the beauty of the stupidity of ned is that it actually saves danny. if he had acted and took joffery off the crown ser belamy would never have saved danny. butterfly affect in full affect

Ned is not exactly Sherlock Holmes. It's not unreasonable to think Renly would sit on this knowledge if he thought Robert would not believe him and take out his anger on him.  Ever have a friend who's gf/bf was cheating on them and everyone knew it but your friend?2. Renly clearly doesn't overburden himself with proper sucession, he has NO RIGHT to the throne, yet he is conspiring with the most honorable man in Westeros to take it.  He sees himself as the best candidate (and he may be right) and that makes him a valid King.  Does anyone who did not carry Joffery in her womb think Joffery will make a good king?  His uncles and grandfather all talk about what a monster he is. Honorable Jaime sets getting Tommen free of Cersei's claws before he becomes Joffery2 as his priority at the end of AFFC.**Edit does --> doesn't **

309	The Iceman of the North	2011-05-31	A wolf doesn't bark, yet here we can clearly hear Ghost barking as he runs off when they come across the Wall. Maybe direwolves do?Most canines, including wolves, do bark. Wolves are better known for their howling, but they bark as well (when appropriate).

He sees himself as the best candidate (and he may be right) and that makes him a valid King.  Does anyone who did not carry Joffery in her womb think Joffery will make a good king?  His uncles and grandfather all talk about what a monster he is. Honorable Jaime sets getting Tommen free of Cersei's claws before he becomes Joffery2 as his priority at the end of AFFC.This is what I assumed. His actual idea (in the books as well if I recall) was to seize all three Lannister children and basically hold them hostage/exile them/something bad, even though he thought they were Baratheons (presumably).
311	Cereal Forel	2011-05-31	Haven't caught up with the thread yet.I loved it all, as usual. The Ros/LF scene was obviously the weakest of the episode and I'm convinced that they've completely missed the ball on Littlefinger as a character. They've nailed the mockery part of it, but they've somehow completely missed the whole "I'm a nice guy and no harm to anyone, everyone likes me because I'm harmless" part of the character. It's what makes Littlefinger work. Here he's just a cocky asswipe, boasting about how much he knows about everyone to anybody who will listen.Loved the wall scenes, all were picture perfect. Loved the Tywin intro scene. I loved the contrast between Tywin and Robert. They both apparently go out hunting, and while Robert gets drunk and killed by his target, Tywin kills, guts and skins his with cold preceision. The fact that it's a stag is fucking awesome. I also loved Jaime's armor, kick ass.I'm tired of Ned being Ned, can't wait for him to leave the show.
312	modehead	2011-05-31	I finally got to watch this episode on a real TV and I'd like to say one thing:
I rescind all my negative comments from before. It's great.
I still think the Littlefinger scene was not done well, as his monologue is very difficult to hear over the moans.  But the rest of the episode was outstanding.
313	oneeye	2011-05-31	Roz... check
Vile male frontal nudity... check
Drogo's speech.... check
Night watch oath.... check.
I'm good.
314	So1ar	2011-05-31	the final scene in the throne room was awesome. the fight could have been a little longer if Ros wasn't such a bitch and took up so much screen time.
also, i love ya sandor but please keep your helmet closed when you wear it. it's so much more badass when the visor/mouth is closed. you look like a re-tard with it open and your face sticking out. i can't take you seriously.

Like he's pissed off all the time and it's bubbling under the surface -- which, incidentally, is how the Hound should talk. Instead we get limp-noodle Hound and raspy forceful Baelish.Ironically, he sounds more like Littlefinger when he's talking about the character than when he's being the character: http://www.youtube.c...h?v=3fAOOJpaKaU
316	Ser Kevan Raley	2011-05-31	Wasn't much of an assassin was he?  Not a Faceless man, some loser poison peddler who breaks out in hives when he has to give her the poison.  Hell, he didn't even recognize his mark as she walks up.  Worst assassin ever.  I think Varys knows how to hire a good assassin if he wants to.Still, to me it seemed she was pretty close to drinking that poisoned wine until Jorah stepped up. It would be hazardous in the extreme for Varys to risk actually killing her and rely on the assassin to be so bad at it.And if it was all staged, and Jorah was meant to intervene, then all it would have taken is a few seconds when he looked away and Dany would be dead. This isn't something you could comfortably plan a continent away and expect it to go smoothly.
317	Rhaegon Targaryen	2011-05-31	Gonna buck the thread trend here. This was my favourite episode thus far. Loved seeing Tywin, (Charles Dance: Best Casting Ever). Very dramatic as well a lot happened. All the non ASOIAFers in my household enjoyed this episode the most as well.
Special mention for Drogo's speech about conquering Westeros as well. It was spine-tingling. Thought he was going to break into the haka there.
318	Ser Kevan Raley	2011-05-31	Most canines, including wolves, do bark. Wolves are better known for their howling, but they bark as well (when appropriate).As far as I know (and I live in wolf country) wolves do not bark like Ghost did in the episode. The howl, as you say, and growl and make other similar noises, but the don't really go "woof, woof, woof".But it's a minor nit to pick. Perhaps direwolves do bark? At any rate, the bigger problem would be that Ghost isn't supposed to make any sound at all.
319	ser_nerdick	2011-05-31	Our HBO Cersei really isn't doing it for me. She's not got any of the fiery temper and coy mannerisms. It's like I'm watching a completely different character than what was in the books. Completely different character. I don't even think Headey plays the "new" Cersei particularly well; as someone else mentioned, in the Ned garden scene she sounds like she is delivering lines from a script rather than having a conversation. And the constant scowl/grimace on her face is getting old. We get it, you're icy. Overall, the portrayal is such a disappointment considering I find her to be one of the more fascinating characters from the books.Drogo is way too clean all the time, and the 10 person Dothraki gatherings continue to be underwhelming. On the positive side, I think Varys is convincing as a scheming butt-kisser, and the camp lead-in scene with the Lannister tents was great (this is the type of scale/backdrop that we need more of).I still think Jon has a fat face.
320	Cereal Forel	2011-05-31	Still, to me it seemed she was pretty close to drinking that poisoned wine until Jorah stepped up. It would be hazardous in the extreme for Varys to risk actually killing her and rely on the assassin to be so bad at it.And if it was all staged, and Jorah was meant to intervene, then all it would have taken is a few seconds when he looked away and Dany would be dead. This isn't something you could comfortably plan a continent away and expect it to go smoothly.Assuming the wine was poisoned to begin with...Varys could have provided the guy with the "poisoned" wine and instructed Jorah to intervene like he did. Then it makes it look like Varys is acting on behalf of the king, all the while not putting Danerys in any real danger AND still giving Drogo a reason to go to war with Robert. It's a win win win situation, as Michael Scott would say.Edit: Or maybe Jorah was never meant to intervene, and Dany would get a free barrel of wine and Varys would still have satisfied the king (at least for the time being).

The howl, as you say, and growl and make other similar noises, but the don't really go "woof, woof, woof".lies. if they don't go "woof, woof" then why do people refer to those animals as a wolf? they were obviously named after the sound they make. *walks away in victory*
323	Rockroi	2011-05-31	I think, in the context of the scene anyway, Renly was implying to just get rid of the Queen and Joffrey anyway, never mind succession.Maybe that was his point, but he never states that nor even implies it PRIOR to Ned bringing up Stannis.  In fact, it seems quite the opposite: that Renly is saying exactly what he wants to accomplish: lets strike now, hold the King and keep power for ourselves.  Why mention Stannis at that point if the whole point is to rule through Joff?  ThatÂ<U+0092>s my problem: why does Ned mention Stannis when nobody is discussing the line of succession?  Why bring up Stannis AT ALL?  It gets even more curious once Stannis is out in the open; Renly starts on this bizarre rant about how this is not time to talk about the line of succession and how HE would make a good King.  Who the HELL even MENTIONED usurping the Throne; the whole CONTEXT of the discussion was keeping Joff on the Throne.  It actually makes no sense.  1. Renly knows. Let's face it, if Ned can figure something immoral and devious out, likely a good bunch of other people have figured it out before him. Ned is not exactly Sherlock Holmes. It's not unreasonable to think Renly would sit on this knowledge if he thought Robert would not believe him and take out his anger on him. Ever have a friend who's gf/bf was cheating on them and everyone knew it but your friend?Completely agree that its possible that Renly knows.  The problem with this theory is that does NOT excuse Ned bringing up Stannis; what Renly knows and does not know is immaterial to Ned bringing up Stannis.  If Renly knows its not up to Ned to ASSUME Renly knows.  If Renly knows Renly should say as much; he never does.  I reject the idea that Ned would ASSUME somebody would know this.  Yes, a few scenes later, Ned TELLS LF, but that just furthers my point: Ned TELLS LF; he does not ASSUME LF knows (he assuredly did, but thatÂ<U+0092>s the whole point).  Same with Renly: it would be INSANE for Ned to say to Renly- in this context Â<U+0096> Â<U+0093>Hey, Renly old chap, your brother is dying (HOLD THAT THOUGHT) and you want to take Joff and hold him over the LannistersÂ<U+0085> but I will assume by all this that you KNOW that Robert has no true heirs and start discussing Stannis.Â<U+0094> Makes no sense. At all. Finally, try to recall the timeline: Robert is still alive at this point.  Of all the people NOT to tell at this moment, Renly is #1; he could EASILY go in and try to revive Robert and make him do something; and this Ned wants to avoid like the plague.  2. Renly clearly does overburden himself with proper sucession, he has NO RIGHT to the throne, yet he is conspiring with the most honorable man in Westeros to take it. He sees himself as the best candidate (and he may be right) and that makes him a valid King. Does anyone who did not carry Joffery in her womb think Joffery will make a good king? His uncles and grandfather all talk about what a monster he is. Honorable Jaime sets getting Tommen free of Cersei's claws before he becomes Joffery2 as his priority at the end of AFFC.Again, I am not saying you are wrong, but thatÂ<U+0092>s not what Renly says nor implies and its not a reasonable product of the discussion to that point.  Renly is COMPLETELY CLEAR: he wants to get Joff away from Cersei and begin ruling through Joff.  If that is the case than there is NO REASON to discuss Stannis or lines of succession because the King will be Joff.  Ned- not Renly -is the one who starts talking about Stannis.  Its only AFTER Ned brings up Stannis that anyone mentions lines of succession and THAT MAKES NO SENSE because nobody is talking about succeeding Robert- Joff is the placeholder; nobody disagrees.  His actual idea (in the books as well if I recall) was to seize all three Lannister children and basically hold them hostage/exile them/something bad, even though he thought they were Baratheons (presumably).Irrelevant.  At no point is Renly discussing, in the book, about declaring himself King.  He is ALWAYS discussing rule through Joff.  From the book:Lord Renly glanced warily at Ser Boros on the far end of the span, at Ser Preston in the doorway behind them. Â<U+0093>That letter.Â<U+0094> He leaned close. Â<U+0093>Was it the regency? Has my brother named you Protector?Â<U+0094> He did not wait for a reply. Â<U+0093>My lord, I have thirty men in my personal guard, and other friends beside, knights and lords. Give me an hour, and I can put a hundred swords in your hand.Â<U+0094> Â<U+0093>And what should I do with a hundred swords, my lord?Â<U+0094> Â<U+0093>Strike! Now, while the castle sleeps.Â<U+0094> Renly looked back at Ser Boros again and dropped his voice to an urgent whisper. Â<U+0093>We must get Joffrey away from his mother and take him in hand. Protector or no, the man who holds the king holds the kingdom. We should seize Myrcella and Tommen as well. Once we have her children, Cersei will not dare oppose us. The council will confirm you as Lord Protector and make Joffrey your ward.Â<U+0094> Ned regarded him coldly. Â<U+0093>Robert is not dead yet. The gods may spare him. If not, I shall convene the council to hear his final words and consider the matter of the succession, but I will not dishonor his last hours on earth by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds.Â<U+0094> Lord Renly took a step back, taut as a bowstring. Â<U+0093>Every moment you delay gives Cersei another moment to prepare. By the time Robert dies, it may be too late . . . for both of us.Â<U+0094> Â<U+0093>Then we should pray that Robert does not die.Â<U+0094> Â<U+0093>Small chance of that,Â<U+0094> said Renly. Â<U+0093>Sometimes the gods are merciful.Â<U+0094> Â<U+0093>The Lannisters are not.Â<U+0094> Martin, George R.R. (2003). A Game of Thrones/A Clash of Kings (Kindle Locations 8231-8244). Bantam. Kindle Edition.There is NOTHING about doing anything but ruling through Joff.   If this is the case, why even DISCUSS Stannis? Renly is doinga power-grab but is only discussing ruling through Joff.  In the books and in the show.  In the book, Ned NEVER mentions Stannis and for good reason: its nonsensical.  Stannis has not discussed revolting; the line of succession is clear, the only spoil-point is who is the Regent: Ned or Cersei.  THAT is the sticking point.  Same is true in the show, only now Ned mentions Stannis. Here is my theory: its poor writing to make up for prior poor writing.  They waited way way way way too long to mention Stannis in the first few episodes so they now have to find poor excuses to explain who Stannis is and why he would be a bad King (and even this is pathetic: they make Satnnis sound like heÂ<U+0092>s Aerys Targaryen Reborn).  Hence, they have to drop him into a scene where HE HAS NO BUSINESS BEING!  ItÂ<U+0092>s a huge error because Ned would NEVER say this to Renly, and because they need to establish Stannis as a character now (because they took too long earlier).  ItÂ<U+0092>s a small thing but it irks me nonetheless.
324	legba11	2011-05-31	I will pay careful attention on my rewatch.  I can't refute what you're saying through anything in my (admitedly lacking) memory.
325	Cereal Forel	2011-05-31	I wasn't paying that close of attention either, but I'd say it's a good bet that it was just poor writing. At least now Stannis has been named, I don't mind that it was dropped randomly into a conversation. The transition felt natural on screen, at least. 
Let's just hope we won't be hit over the head about him on every episode from now on. I remember when people were complaining about Theon not being named, and now we have to deal with him bringing up his damn heritage every time somebody looks at him.
326	The Knight of Grasses	2011-05-31	My least favorite episode so far.  Most of that has to do with the terrible LF/Roz/Random Moaning Whore scene.  I'm not a huge fan of the nudity in general, but this is HBO, so I'm willing to put up with it as long as it has a purpose, either directly (like the Cersei/Jaime sex scene), or indirectly to develop a character (like Tyrion or Viserys).  The Dothraki stuff is marginal, but it's pretty tame.  This scene with the two women was way over the top, and detracted from the actual point of the scene, which was LF's diatribe about his feelings on the Starks.  And I disliked the diatribe itself - why the heck is LF telling all this to women who work in his brothel?  I said this after last week's episode; I don't care for what they're doing to his character.  He's not nearly the sly, cunning charmer that he's supposed to be - he's just an asshole.
I also disliked the Tywin scene.  Tywin Lannister butchering his own kill?  Tywin Lannister hunting in the first place?  Yes, he's a bad ass.  But I think they could have shown that in another way.  Again, the visuals detracted from the point of the scene, in my opinion.  The actual dialogue with Jaime was fine.
Third, the Theon-Osha scene was just meh.  They're really hammering Theon's exile from the Iron Islands and his position as a kind of prisoner of the Starks.  I think it will eventually pay off, but right now it feels like a bit too much.
What's sad is that the rest of the episode seemed really good, but those three scenes were at the beginning and soured me for the remainder.  I will have to go back and watch it again.  I might appreciate it more on a second viewing.
327	Maltaran	2011-05-31	When Drogo was making his speech, I was half-expecting the subtitles to say something about crushing his enemies and hearing the lamentations of their women.
328	The Iceman of the North	2011-05-31	When Drogo was making his speech, I was half-expecting the subtitles to say something about crushing his enemies and hearing the lamentations of their women.An obvious omission from the screen writers. One wonder if they actually deserve their guild membership.
329	smegma	2011-05-31	I noticed what Rockroi is saying upon my third viewing - I thought I might be looking too far into the dialog, but it just didn't make sense to me. I think it is an error, but I doubt 99% of the people watching will be confused by it, and just take it without a second thought. I figured it was A. Either the dialog was supposed to be longer but a few lines were cut either in editing or in the shoot, and the context was altered as a result or B. They decided they needed to mention Stannis again (to drill home to the viewer that is who Ned is supporting and why Renly thinks he is unfit) but by inserting him in there they didn't consider the continuity problem. 
Like I said though, probably not a huge deal to even most reader-fans.
330	SerArthurHeath	2011-05-31	I reckon it was a cut in editing that now doesn't make sense. I'm hoping for quite a few scenes in our DVD edition- most show DVDs that I've bought have a couple of extended scenes per episode just because directors tend to overshoot then cut later because it's easier to see what works better on film than on paper
331	RAddichio	2011-05-31	Think Iain Glenn deserves a shout-out for being picture perfect week to week. He is Jorah Mormont...he inhabits the character. Can't wait to see him as Obi-Wan in the next Star Wars remake.Agreed - as w/Baelish, Iain Glenn totally conforms to my impression of grrm's written character.  For true Iain Glenn admirers, you can catch him as a villainous character in series 9 of the UK spythriller 'Spooks' -- another great performance.  His Vaughan plays most effectively off the controversial fallen MI5 operative Lucas North(Richard Armitage - another fine actor with amazing  gravitas)The Jon scenes are authentic in that they bore me in the exact same way they did in the books. Definitely didn't miss the lack of Jon the last couple episodes - always the most dreaded chapters for me, especially book one in where Jon spends 98% of his time whining. Speaking of maesters, brutal dig by Maester Luwin on Theon. Was, like, "Oh, snap!" And from maybe the most unexpected source possible.Isn't it curious how subjective impressions of individual characters can be.  For me the Dany/Dothraki chapters were most boring and triggered feelings of dread and little enthusiasm to continue reading, whenever I saw her name on a new chapter
332	RAddichio	2011-05-31	I liked the episode, even if I knew what was going to happen, still kept me on the edge of my seat.I think Ned is an honorable man and just can't act any other way, it's not because he's not a smart man, he can't act against the principles he has lived by all his life, his is a tragic story because of his loyalty to others.I also liked Tywin's intro and the scene with Jamie, great scene between the two actors, believed them as father and son.I agree w/your assessment of Ned's character.  He's a far better, more honorable man than the vast majority in Westeros.  It's not that he needed to be more like them, but the exact opposite.
333	Lany Cassandra	2011-05-31	Isn't it curious how subjective impressions of individual characters can be.  For me the Dany/Dothraki chapters were most boring and triggered feelings of dread and little enthusiasm to continue reading, whenever I saw her name on a new chapterOn one (or more) of my rereads I actually skipped all the Dany chapters.  I would like to say I read them really well the first time, but in truth I just skimmed them (after GoT the first time).
334	SnowBastard	2011-05-31	This was a great episode! Lots of people bashing on the LF scene...hmmm. The moans, I agree were a bit too loud and took just a little away from his monologue but the monologue was fantastic! The actor who plays him portrays him exceptionally well in my opinion. Hes a ruthless piece of shit and he sounds monotonous because he doesn't care about anyone enough to bring emotion. If he was an emotional wreck he wouldn't be LF. Funny enough, this is the exact way I pictured and heard him while reading the books.
Cons
-I don't think Mark Addy hit the mark on the death bed - he came out sounding strained rather than dying.
-The presence of Ros baffles me to no end.
-Maester Aemon just doesnt feel right. I think Aemon and Renly have been the only snags the casting thus far.
-As just mentioned, I simply am not believing anything Renly does. The actor has not sold me on anything. ( Hard to imagine him pulling off the peach scene next season.)
Pros
-Drogo, Drogo, Drogo. I can't say enough about Jason Mamoa's silent but amazing performance. His rage and love for Dany was shown here finally throughout the episode. Beautiful acting. Drogo is the exact same as I saw him in the book!
-Jorah and Dany have great chemistry. Their scenes are always good.
-The godswood scene at the wall was superb.
-The betrayal of Ned Stark with LF to end the episode was a highlight for me. The look of absolute frustration on the face of Ned before the shot was cut to credits was just another testament of Sean Bean's powerful acting ability. 
-Tywin and Jaime had the best scene in the entire episode hands down. Nikolaj is Jaime effin Lannister and Dance is Tywin Lannister, end of discussion!
Neutral
-Theon and Osha were totally bailed out by Luwin to save the scene. Not really digging Oshas character as much as the book. Theon gets a pass.
Anxiously anticipating the next episode as I think it will properly set up the most insane plot twist in movie/book/show history! I remember reading it for the first time ever and re reading it for the next hour again and again to make sure that it happened. I hope that non readers will feel the exact same way.
335	Xenophon	2011-05-31	Wow, despite my low expectations the sexposition scene still managed to amaze me with its terribleness.  First of all, it's getting old; Viserys in the bath and Renly/Loras were clever, but there's only so many times you can recycle the same sex = politics metaphor.  Second, the sex threatened to overshadow the exposition.  Loud screams and "Play with her ass"??  Were the script writers all 15 year boys?  It's getting to the point where I'm embarrassed to watch GoT with friends.
Fortunately the rest of the episode was all pretty good.  
Interesting change in the Renly/Ned scene.  Having Renly say he wanted the throne himself makes Ned's refusal of his offer seem much more reasonable.  It's a big change from the books, where Renly was only proposing cutting Cersei out.  I don't really mind it though.  Makes Ned a bit more sympathetic, while also foreshadowing Renly's campaign.  Like others said, the actual dialogue doesn't really make sense, but I think everyone got the idea.
Drogo's speech was great.  If you just described the scene, it would sound ridiculous and cheesy, but it worked.
336	Jaime L	2011-05-31	Agreed - as w/Baelish, Iain Glenn totally conforms to my impression of grrm's written character.  For true Iain Glenn admirers, you can catch him as a villainous character in series 9 of the UK spythriller 'Spooks' -- another great performance.  His Vaughan plays most effectively off the controversial fallen MI5 operative Lucas North(Richard Armitage - another fine actor with amazing  gravitas)Yeah, cause his self-assured potrayal of Jorah interested me I checked out his filmography. Man's been in a ton of things including Kingdom of Heaven, Tomb Raider and Resident Evil. Imagine he was more impressive in Spooks or some of his theater work, but justifies the sense I've had that he seemed familiar. Isn't it curious how subjective impressions of individual characters can be.  For me the Dany/Dothraki chapters were most boring and triggered feelings of dread and little enthusiasm to continue reading, whenever I saw her name on a new chapterWell, to be honest, the Dany scenes weren't my favorites in the books either. They felt like a distraction from the core action occurring in Kings Landing, the Eyrie and other places. Her story arc did get more interesting to me as she set off into the unknown, whereas the Jon chapters never lost their angsty, paint by numbers fantasy feel. Nothing he did or accomplished felt surprising and the frequent deus ex machina to his benefit kinda bothered me. But beyond that still was substantially happier to see Eddard, Tyrion, Catelyn, Arya, Sansa or Jaime showing up as the chapter heading than any of the satellite storylines, but that's just me. I get it that the "satellite" storylines probably become the main ones before this whole thing runs out (a song of fire and ice is a small hint), but they rarely hold my interest to the extent of the intrigue and storytelling possibilites that envelops the POV characters who actually interact with one another.

337	The Anti-Targ	2011-05-31	On one (or more) of my rereads I actually skipped all the Dany chapters.  I would like to say I read them really well the first time, but in truth I just skimmed them (after GoT the first time).I'm re-reading GoT now and skipping every Dany chapter. Probably won't skip the Dany chapters in my aCoK re-read, will likely skim those to find the bits I feel I want/need to read. Will probably skip the aSoS chapters. Not really interested in reading about her conquest of the Slaver cities.
338	Penny the Direwolf	2011-05-31	The tension is ramping up. From now on things will irrevocably definitely change. Some notes:I'm not sure why Varys apparently sent assassins to kill Daenerys when it was established that he conspired with Illyrio on behalf the Targaryens.I have always wondered why everyone on here seems to think Varys is being truthful when he talks to Illyrio. Varys lies to everyone! We have no idea what side he is actually on.

339	Penny the Direwolf	2011-05-31	I thought this episode was going to be better..  I am re-reading GoT and prior to this episode, I did not over-read (I always stopped where the privious' weeks episode stopped.)  This week, though, I realized that if I wanted to get all 4 books read by july 12th (and the best day of my life?) I'd have to get going.  So, I knew everything that I thought would be in this episode, fresh in my brain...  I wanted more "you live or you die scene."  I wanted Tyrion telling Bronn about his wife.  I wanted Bran and Robb in Winterfell meeting all the Stark bannermen....  What did I get instead?  Two women fake-f-ing each other. 
Now don't get me wrong, I love Littlefinger.  I loved it when he refused Roz and said "I'm saving myself."  Some weird romantic part of me feels terrible for Littlefinger...and hopes beyond hope that he has something deep down that's likable.  I think that thing is his love for Cat.  I love that by him saying that line, I can think that he really was planning on marrying Cat (once Ned killed himself with honor).  Think about it...he didn't marry Lysa until after Cat was confirmed dead.  I think he was saving himself for Cat...and settled for using Lysa for scheming plans.  I also have no problems with him talking abut his past to his whores.  It just shows how he has no friends, and he doesn't think enough of the whores to be worried about them being spies or reading into it.
But...Littlefinger characterization was covered up with nipples and thrusting.  It was distracting and gross.  It's to the point where I have to warn my friends that it's a great show...but is pretty much soft core porn.

340	Steel_Wind	2011-05-31	Illyrio explains this in part to us. They never bet on Daenerys initially. She was simply the price of the Dothraki. The bet was always on Viserys. The assassination order for Daenerys was given at a time when Viserys was, to the knowledge of Varys, still alive. Varys also hedged his bets by making sure Mormont knew about the order. Mormont was not given a pardon in the book so that he would stay, continue to provide intelligence and interfere with the attempt. There was a very good chance that Mormont would foil it; the poisoned wine was selected as a weapon which was relatively easy for Mormont to intercept. If he didn't, with Viserys alive and the Khal short a wife and unborn son, it was hoped that Khal Drogo's pride and rage would then cause the Dothraki to invade - and Viserys takes the throne. If she survived the assassination attempt -- same result.The granting of the pardon to Mormont in the TV series is a significant departure from the books. I believe it is D&D trying to simplify matters for the audience -- but is also D&D hedging their bets so that Mormont could be allowed to stay on with Dany in ASoS if the series needs him to. (Barristan cut for budget reasons, actor can't be resigned/ passes away, etc.)In any event, Viserys died -- and to paraphrase Illyrio, so did Dany. The empty child she was "drowned in the Dothraki Sea". What emerged from the Dothraki Sea was someone -- and something -- mostly unexpected.The above is the easy explanation. The more unlikely and more complex one is that Varys is in league with the house of Black and White and he may be, (though is not necessarily) a full priest and even a Faceless man.  There is a scene in the House of Black and White where Arya attends a meeting on Level 2 of the Temple and one of the attendees could easily fit a description of Varys. If so, Varys' longterm motivations are, accordingly, both inscrutable and informed by prophecy.  Again, if so, in addition to Mormont as insurance, Varys' also bet that Dany would survive the attempt because of the prophecy.

341	Whoring Drunkard	2011-06-01	Maybe that was his point, but he never states that nor even implies it PRIOR to Ned bringing up Stannis.  In fact, it seems quite the opposite: that Renly is saying exactly what he wants to accomplish: lets strike now, hold the King and keep power for ourselves.  Why mention Stannis at that point if the whole point is to rule through Joff?  ThatÂ<U+0092>s my problem: why does Ned mention Stannis when nobody is discussing the line of succession?  Why bring up Stannis AT ALL?  It gets even more curious once Stannis is out in the open; Renly starts on this bizarre rant about how this is not time to talk about the line of succession and how HE would make a good King.  Who the HELL even MENTIONED usurping the Throne; the whole CONTEXT of the discussion was keeping Joff on the Throne.  It actually makes no sense.  Hmm, that's not quite how I took the scene.  It's clearly a change from the books in that TV Renly tries to sell (poorly) Ned on backing him as king.  So TV Renly is NOT talking about keeping Joff on the throne.  TV Renly was in fact talking about seizing Joff and installing another king, because whoever controls the rightful king has the power to install whomever he wants as the king.  TV Ned plays along with this premise and says in effect that in that case, if it's not Joff, it still wouldn't be you.  It would be Stannis.
342	ingsve	2011-06-01	Looking at the episode again I realise that there are five Kingsguard present in front of Joffrey. Jaime is obviously not there but who is missing other than him? Was there someone missing in the novels at this point in the story or is this just a coincidence of some sort? Perhaps it's for symmetrical purposes.

Was there someone missing in the novels at this point in the story or is this just a coincidence of some sort? Perhaps it's for symmetrical purposes.Might be a kingsguard with Myrcella and Tommen who are not present, just in case someone sent his men to take them as hostages.
344	Mad Queen	2011-06-01	In the novels, Sansa notices that all the Kingsguard except Jaime were there.
345	Derfel Cadarn	2011-06-01	Doesn't matter. As the Russians said: Quantity has a quality of it's own. 40,000 horsemen vs 20 - 60,000 soldiers in each of the 7 kingdoms would soon lose a war of attrition with no hope of replenishing their numbers. No Jaime getting 30,000 men of his own made Robert's angst over a Dothraki invasion look ridiculous. It was very important for Roberts 5 vs 1 lesson mean that none of the 5 alone could field an army large enough to cause significant loss to the Dothraki. The Lannisters clearly have a large enough force to worry the Dothraki.The Dothraki horde is 40,000 experienced warriors all on horseback, with horsebows.  The majority of the Westeros army are unarmoured peasants, many probably carryng pitchforks.  If they were heavy infantry, they could beat the horde by forming a shieldwall, but they would be too poorly armoured and too poorly trained.  Plus the horde would just ignore the shieldwall and burn and pillage.  The knights of Westeros would do better, but there are much fewer of them.  Plus the dothraki are light cavalry, if a large body of knights charged, the dothraki would evade it and attack the flanks.  The dothraki, being horse archers, would probably target the horses of the knights.  In any cae, I think Dany's plan is to hook up with Targaryen loyalists which would give her access to knights and foot as well as castles and logistics.
346	Volderon	2011-06-01	Funny little quote here...in ASOS after Jon becomes LC, Pyp says, "Sam, Sam, Sam the Wizard, Sam the wonder..."
Coincidence?
347	Narrow C	2011-06-01	Enjoying the whole series so far, first time posting.
One angle on the Tywin skinning his own deer that nobody's brought up (although the symbolism of the stag is obvious)... Tywin and Robert both went hunting. Tywin came back successful; Robert came back dying.
One other thought... We can solve two major nitpick issues in one fell swoop:
Name Roz's left boob "Shaggydog" and her right boob "Grey wind."  That way the "where's all the direwolves?' questions can go away, because you'll see them every episode.
Just so.
348	Carldog	2011-06-01	After viewing last nights re-run of ep 7, it seemed to me that with the shock factor removed from the porn secne the show moved along better.  In Sundays showing I was waiting for more in your face footage, but it didn't come.  Made it a little better the second time through... still wasn't a great ep.

350	Brewmaster	2011-06-01	As far as I know (and I live in wolf country) wolves do not bark like Ghost did in the episode. The howl, as you say, and growl and make other similar noises, but the don't really go "woof, woof, woof".But it's a minor nit to pick. Perhaps direwolves do bark? At any rate, the bigger problem would be that Ghost isn't supposed to make any sound at all.Wolves and dogs are genetically the same animal. Of course they bark. Over centuries we domesticated them and bred specific breeds that look vastly different from each other, but they are still genetically the same species capable of interbreeding. Barking isn't something we introduced by selective breeding.
351	theMountainGoat	2011-06-01	I think my biggest problem with this episode is what it did not include and its a very small innocuous scene - Ned having breakfast with Arya and Sansa on the morning right before he learns Robert is dead. Ned tells them their ship leaves later that day and he wants them packed and ready to go. Arya says she has already packed and can she have one last lesson with Syrio before they go. After this Sansa still upset about being made to leave runs off and runs away from the Septa [takes place off screen] and I agree with those who said we should not have seen her go to Cersei because that would tip off the surprise a little, but surely we should have at least seen her run off.
This scene is important because it establishes why the girls are still in the city and where they are and what they are doing when the shit hits the fan. Many TV viewers think the girls are gone, well on their way back to Winterfell because in the world of TV if you say they are being sent home one week and then you don't show them in the episode the next week they are effectively gone. How are they going to explain this in episode 8? Will we rewind time to before Ned's arrest? A caption saying "one hour earlier" perhaps which would really take me out of the flow of the show. Or maybe just jump straight into Arya's scene with Syrio and expect the audience to catch up to what is going on without any explanation at all?
Also when Arya goes to the stables and finds her bags there, pulls out Needle and uses the pointy end on the stable boy is it going to make sense why her bags are there? Is she going to say "ah my bags are here from when I packed them earlier, I hope my sword is still here?" Which would be clumsy exposition. Perhaps she will just have Needle with her when she is training with Syrio or she will retrieve it from her room in the Tower of the Hand instead. Lots of ways round it but I can see it being confusing if that scene does play out as described in the book and there is no explanation given.
Even more worrying is the suggestion someone made that perhaps Sansa did not tip off Cersei about Ned's plans which be a significant change from the book events. Plausible enough that Cersei could figure it out without Sansa's help but will this be what we are complaining about next week? And with George having written episode 8 will we still complain that the details are different?
352	tarantella	2011-06-01	Speaking of things that were left out.  We left the Wall in ep 4 with Jon and Sam hanging around on guard duty, and Sam afraid that Ser Alliser is going to keep beating the hell out of him in "training".  Then we return in ep 7 and he's going to be a steward, and he's totally fine.  People who read the book know that Jon went and asked Aemon to take him in, but non-readers are just going to guess Sam got lucky on the draw or something.  Not a major thing, really, but the chapter they left out shows that Jon is willing to step outside the usual boundaries to help his friends out, and it's nicely mirrored later on when Sam does the same for him in ASOS.
I also see they're staying true to the books and taking the "Ser Alliser is a total dick" route.  I thought they might try to make him more sympathetic.  I don't mind, but they didn't set up his grudge against Jon that well.

Still, I never pictured him as someone who would get his hands "dirty" in such a way.
Would also loved if they kept him with shaved head and sideburns, as it was perfectly described in the books why it showcase his character.
354	evanesco75	2011-06-01	Well, Jon already went beyond the usual boundaries when he threatened Rast with Ghost for Sam.
355	tarantella	2011-06-01	Well, Jon already went beyond the usual boundaries when he threatened Rast with Ghost for Sam.Yeah, that's true.  Again, not a major thing, but it still feels like they left a hole there.

358	smidget25	2011-06-01	Wow, despite my low expectations the sexposition scene still managed to amaze me with its terribleness.  First of all, it's getting old; Viserys in the bath and Renly/Loras were clever, but there's only so many times you can recycle the same sex = politics metaphor.  Second, the sex threatened to overshadow the exposition.  Loud screams and "Play with her ass"??  Were the script writers all 15 year boys?  It's getting to the point where I'm embarrassed to watch GoT with friends.Fortunately the rest of the episode was all pretty good.  Interesting change in the Renly/Ned scene.  Having Renly say he wanted the throne himself makes Ned's refusal of his offer seem much more reasonable.  It's a big change from the books, where Renly was only proposing cutting Cersei out.  I don't really mind it though.  Makes Ned a bit more sympathetic, while also foreshadowing Renly's campaign.  Like others said, the actual dialogue doesn't really make sense, but I think everyone got the idea.Drogo's speech was great.  If you just described the scene, it would sound ridiculous and cheesy, but it worked.I agree with everything you said here. The Ned/Renly scene did seem a bit strange in that they tried to keep the dialogue the same as the books, despite Renly's motivations being different. It made it sound like they were having two separate conversations. But I think it was necessary for them to include Renly wanting the throne (unlike the book), so it wouldn't come out of nowhere when he tries to claim it later. I remember reading that bit in the GOT and being like, 'Huh. Why?'  /stunned.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':stunned:' /> They've actually given Renly some motivation and have foreshadowed his upcoming part well. I didn't like this exposition either. I was paying more attention to the sex scene than what LF was talking about, whereas in other cases (Loras/Renly, Viserys) I thought it was very cleverly done. They should have cut it down a bit, or including less of the random sex tutorial. And seriously, why Roz?! How is she relevant?  /dunno.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':dunno:' />
359	So1ar	2011-06-01	why does dany's belly not even look like she's pregnant yet? i can't remember exactly how she loses her son, but doesn't she give birth to him?
360	Morrigan	2011-06-01	Yeah, that annoyed me a bit. Will we ever see her with a pregnant-looking belly?I liked Jon in the books but in the show he's a whinny little dick.His father is fighting for his life and all Jon can say is, "Wah, wah, I didn't get into my favourite class!" Lame!Well, you're being unfair. At that point in the story, Jon doesn't know what's happening with his father Ned. Hell, in the book's timeline, when Jon takes his vow, Ned hadn't even been arrested yet.

362	Steel_Wind	2011-06-01	why does dany's belly not even look like she's pregnant yet? i can't remember exactly how she loses her son, but doesn't she give birth to him?Given the clothing choice they've gone for Daenerys, it's quite problematic. Ordinarily, an actress would wear a prosthetic underpadding beneath a maternity style top/dress/garment -- but the choice of wardrobe Dany has as a Dothraki since she "went native" won't permit such a prosthetic as it is not capable of hiding it.I would, accordingly, guess that we will be getting a "miscarriage" as opposed to a "still birth replete with grave worms" etc.. As such, I would further expect that the Mother of Dragons will not be suckling her "progeny", either.
363	Jaxom 1974	2011-06-01	Yeah, one thing that's clear is the HBO series knows the characters. Is it wrong when he declared "I should be king" to Ned, I chuckled? Was definitely a Yeah, you go ahead and do that moment. The sense I get from the TV series is that if Renly is Ned's last great hope in Kings Landing, he was fucked from the beginning.See, if they knew the characters so well (and I kinda agree they do with one main exception), Renly wouldn't have been so altered.  In the book, Renly is the half of Robert that is all bluster and confidence (as we learn Stannis is the steel and brawn that was the other half of Robert in ACOK).  In the seies, Renly is the complete opposite.Catelyn describes Renly's host as the "knights of summer" playing at war.  Renly never knew what he truly wanted.  The spoiled, impulsive young lord who felt entitled...the added scene with Loras in the show gives us a timid, unsure youth who has to be told what to do by his younger boyfriend (another disappointment in that you have to work the relationship out in the book, the show just bludgeons you with it).Rockroi quotes the scene with Ned and that Renly is far superior to the show Renly.How dare you, sir. Renly is majestic:http://img707.images...nlymajestic.jpgOh snap.I completely disagree. As somebody who barely registered who Renly was in the first book (although I did come to like him in the second), I feel the change is really refreshing. It's nice not to have a man who goes around swinging a sword, speaking of war and/or screwing people over. The scene with Loras set up him approaching Ned in a way that it never did in the book - which came completely out of the left field when I read it. It actually gave him some genuine motivation.As I say though, the show's portrayal of Renly misses the entire point of the character.
364	Ser Warpechowski	2011-06-01	I actually didn't like Tywin skinning the animal. Btw Was that a dear, and bit of symbolism in all that ?Still, I never pictured him as someone who would get his hands "dirty" in such a way.Would also loved if they kept him with shaved head and sideburns, as it was perfectly described in the books why it showcase his character.Well, he said he hated whores, yet there was Shae on his bed...
365	Lady Blackfish	2011-06-02	I liked the Tywin and Jaime scene overall.  At the beginning of the season I was most excited about the casting of the Lannister men, and so far that is panning out.  Granted, Dance's Tywin came off as a little more demonstrative with his pride and condescension than I imagined, but overall there was a lot to like in that scene.  I feel like this show very clearly gets and enjoys some characters more than others, and I think the Lannisters tend to be on the advantageous side of that preference.  I could tolerate the blatant obviousness of the stag symbolism because of how well the actors played off each other.  It was interesting how they solidly characterized Tywin's retaliation as a dynastic power play this early on; it's debatable and ambiguous in the book.
I liked Cersei's talk with Ned well enough, although I'm still not sure if I like this Cersei who worshiped Robert once.  Is she now going to be head over heels for both Robert and Rhaegar?  I liked Headey's delivery of her "Your sister was a corpse" line, while at the same time I missed the book's more fiery and exuding Cersei more than ever in this scene.
The brothel scene with Littlefinger and the whores was terrible and absurd and I hated it.
I'm really enjoying Sumpter so much as Luwin, and think that the Wall arc with Jon and Sam is another thing HBO is doing uniformly well.  Mind you, I also think that's one of the easier storylines to get right, it's pretty simplistic and archetypal compared to what else is going on.
I thought Robert's death was a bit anticlimactic, but not bad.  I wished we could see the moment of his death.  Also, Ned has really pretty penmanship!
Thirding? the love for Iain Glenn.  I always found Jorah very interesting in the books and I'm glad Glenn is making me as interested as him in the show.
Still need to think more about the changes to Renly.  I think I don't mind us seeing more doubts in him, as we saw previously, and I actually disagree that he was only ever Robert's blustery side.  He had Robert's swagger but in a more moderate dose, even though humility was never his strong suit, and I can see seeds of his character as presented in the show there in the book.  Renly was never a soldier, the book points out that he was only ever a passing fighter, but he had power of charisma as well as a suitable enough sense of duty and fairmindedness.  He was not without cleverness and while he had a certain carelessness about him, I found it believable that in time he could grow up to be a pretty good king.  The show's Renly seems to be the voice of anti-machoness, and while I can see why it bothers some people or strikes them as out of character, I can't mind it too much because, damn, I really like this Renly.  I want to be his best friend after the way he chewed Robert out in the last episode.
ETA: Oh I forgot to mention, I think the show did Ned a disservice by not emphasizing the massacre of Rhaegar's children before the end of this episode, I think it would've made Ned's choice more sympathetic, if still politically unwise.  Most people seem to be having a hair-ripping-out experience with Ned in this episode, while I think it would've better served his character if we could at least understand that his honor is, from a certain perspective, understandable and not totally removed from reality.  Children torn screaming from their beds is no small thing, and Ned's choice would've seemed more difficult instead of so obviously dumb.

366	Rhodan	2011-06-02	While the show is awsome, sometimes I think it is on drugs. Jorah doubting existence of dragons was definitely one such moment. Is he "fall of the 6 kingdoms to Aegon was an inside job" conspiracist?
I must say that I simply disliked meeting of Eddard and Cersei. With itÂ´s typical adaptational simplification it was tense as married couple bickering about wife spending too much money.
Lack of Jon pleading for Sam wasnÂ´t bad just becouse of understanding of SamÂ´s story on the Wall, but also becouse I think Aemon needs more screen time.
These nitpicks aside, I liked the episode - I donÂ´t mind Renly coming out... With his desire of being the king. It makes the things a little quickier.
BTW, I am curious if Martin will give us some info dumps about RheagarÂ´s children or Stannis, we seriously need it.

I want to be his best friend after the way he chewed Robert out in the last episode.I like him too, a lot better than Book-Renly who was really just there to act frivolous and get killed. When nice-guy TV Renly dies, it's going to have a lot more impact simply because he's more likeable.
368	smegma	2011-06-02	I actually like both book Renly and tv Renly a lot. Perhaps it's because I filled in the blanks a bit the same way that the HBO show has done, but I always envisioned book Renly as the one most suited for the throne, and the show tells us why he's a good fit (or at least wants to be a good king). I also liked the smackdown of Renly on Robert, as the three major scenes with him - Loras/Renly, Robert/Renly, and Ned/Renly all created a solid perspective on his thought process and WHY he decides to do what he does. I felt like the scene with Robert showed him letting off steam with thoughts that had been eating at him for some time, and the scene with Ned showed him kind of putting it all together in his head and finally speaking it out loud. Kinda rambling, but anyway my point is that I think that both versions are likable. I also think we may see more of the charismatic Renly once he is putting on his show for the hordes that follow him.
369	Tywin's bastard	2011-06-02	Lack of Jon pleading for Sam wasnÂ´t bad just becouse of understanding of SamÂ´s story on the Wall, but also becouse I think Aemon needs more screen time.That part would also make viewers ask why Sam wasn't considered for such an assignment in the first place though. The Night's Watch is a shadow of what it should be but it's not because the leaders are incompetent enough to put a very physically ungifted and mentally weak person in the rangers or something like that. It should be natural to put him with the maester, in the kitchens or something like that.BTW, I am curious if Martin will give us some info dumps about RheagarÂ´s children or Stannis, we seriously need it.We'll see, but I doubt it. Rhaegar's children (and wife) aren't very important in the first two seasons (I'd put in more information about Rhaegar himself before his family) and we didn't get too much information about Stannis in the book either. They might talk about what he's doing a bit but I expect most of the info about him coming in the next season as the last three episodes should be quite packed with events.

He was worthy only as scholar/AemonÂ´s asssistent, so Chett had to go.

In the show they streamlined it so they all "graduated" at the same time so they also managed to remove all need for Jon to do that.

379	VikingLegion	2011-06-02	30,000 men is a ridiculously large number of soldiers to have at Jaime's disposal considering Tywin will be retaining a large host under his own command.Makes the threat of Dothraki invasion seem rather managable if it's only 40,000 and one House can muster a larger army. Jaime taking 5-10,000 would have made the Dothraki horde seem more horde-ish.It's all academic of course, given how the book ends but still One armyu of 40,000 doesn't seem like much of a threat after the Tywin/Jaime scene.Yeah, do you really think Tywin is going to offer up any of those 60,000 men in the defense of Westeros until the Horde is on his very doorstep?  Every lord is going to turtle up in their castles and wait for a rival family to expend their own troops, that way they can presumably swoop in, finish off the Dothraki, and then have an uncontested romp across the continent.  That's just Westerosi Politics 101.  Of all the Houses, I see only Stark riding out to meet them.  They'd put up a decent fight, but lose in the end, much to the Lannister's glee.So while the plotting, scheming Lords of Westeros concoct their little games to use the Dothraki as a means to weaken rival houses, the Horde just keeps pillaging, burning, looting, and getting stronger as their ranks swell with more and more commoners that are either enslaved by Drogo, or join willingly once they see their own leaders leave them out in the wind to die.  The Dothraki gain control of all grain and whatnot, and the shiny knights of the realm all starve to death, or are forced into a desperation charge out on the fields where superior Dothraki horsemanship/archery mutilates them.60,000 Lannister troops do not change this equation.  The Lords of Westeros can't stop bickering for a moment, even when they're own impending doom is upon them.It is known.

The books sound like they are going for Ye Olde Englishe, but sometimes end up with slightly jarring phrases that only a modern American could write. It doesn't spoil it for me - after all, Westeros is not England, and the characters are probably not speaking a language anything like English.

382	Xenophon	2011-06-03	There are ungrammatical expressions everywhere (including the U.K.), but yes- this one was particularly American. Good lord.  I'd never heard that one before, but I see it's over 50 years old.
383	Roose Boltons Pet Leech	2011-06-03	I'd include Martin in this. I'm from England. The books sound like they are going for Ye Olde Englishe, but sometimes end up with slightly jarring phrases that only a modern American could write. It doesn't spoil it for me - after all, Westeros is not England, and the characters are probably not speaking a language anything like English.Yeah, it was fairly jarring to read about "Character A writing B" instead of "Character A writing to B". And the spelling of "honour" vs "honor". Not that it matters in any meaningful sense.

384	AndyC	2011-06-04	Well, first post from me ...
Main points of discussion seem to be the two scenes that were the significantly "new" ones: Tywin & Jaime & the stag, and Gratuitous Ros and the Soft Porn Exposition.
The Tywin scene, I liked a lot. With the possible caveat that Jaime's hair seemed darker than ever.  I don't like to quibble for the sake of it, but as the hair colour issue is a highly significant plot point (on hair colour, I'd never see Joffrey as being Jaime's son in the TV show), it does grate somewhat.  That said, I love the actor's portrayal of Jaime and I think he's got the character absolutely spot on: cocky and arrogant but with some insecurity and lingering (almost hidden) desire to be understood as not dishonourable.  Just invest in some hair dye and he'll be perfect.
I can really see Dance as Tywin - excellent casting.
The brothel scene, though, almost ruined the entire show.  It was five minutes long, of girl-on-girl action and "now play with her arse".  Seeing as my 17-year-old daughter was watching with us, to say we were cringing is an understatement.  It's the scene that's put me off ever recommending the show to any friends or family - I'd hate to envisage their reaction if they tuned in to what seems to be a soft-porn show, especially if they turned off in embarassment within the first five minutes.  The irritant is heightened by the amount of precious screen time it consumes (when you think of what else had to be sliced out to allow the extra interminable minutes of Ros writhing and moaning) and a personal lack of belief that it achieves anything positive to make up for it.  Consider: there are three potential reactions to the scene - 
- Arousal and interest.  People falling into this category are paying close attention to the sex and probably mentally tuning out the stuff that Littlefinger is saying.  You don't watch porn for the plot, after all.
-  Taking it in their stride with no real reaction.  They'll have taken the plot exposition on board, but would have done so in a non-sexposition exposition as well.
- Embarassed/uncomfortable.  Will tune out as much as possible until it's over.  At the end of the episode, my daughter was surprised at Littlefinger's betrayal and asked us why, and we explained - and mentioned the brothel scene.  She said "oh, I was checking my Facebook during that bit".
'Tis annoying, really.
That said, much of the rest of the episode was good: the Night's Watch oath (I'm not too fussed about the truncation of it) was good.  I think the entire "feel" of the Wall and Castle Black is spot on: bleak, tired, run-down.  The confrontation in the garden with Cersei (yes, it should have been the godswood and Cersei's seductive offers in the books didn't come across, but I understand why they didn't do that and don't think that the loss of the godwood is a big quibble).  The dying Robert.  The conversation with Littlefinger was great.  And the throne room scene was spot on.
(I wasn't quite so enamoured with the Renly scene, to be fair - I didn't like Renly trying to usurp the throne with no knowledge of the Joffrey/Jaime situation).
However, I'm looking forward to episode 8 and hope that the extra gratuitous sex will be toned down (I wanted "Game of Thrones", not ""Dany Does Dragonstone"  (sequels: "Dany Does Duskendale", "Dany Does Dorne", with "Dany Does the Dreadfort" to be published imminently)
385	jellydonut	2011-06-04	Episode 8 is Martin's episode, so if that one's filled with porn we can't really complain about the adaptation, can we? /smug.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':smug:' />

I know what you're saying, but no, I don't think that the fact that GRRM wrote it will prevent complaints. (D&D put the final touches in! He was told to add more Ros! And that's aside from the fact that even the books have spawned decades of discussion, and yes, even complaints.))

388	Abaddon	2011-06-04	Bryan Cogman wrote the screenplay for Episode 4 but he didn't write the Viserys/Doreah bathtub scene, it was added.  So, it's possible George doesn't write in a sex scene but one gets added.
389	LugaJetboyGirl-irra	2011-06-04	"I could care less what other people think."I say this. I don't know why everyone gets their damn feathers ruffled over this shit. 'I could care less' is as equally meaningful as the 'proper' way of saying it because it usually includes sarcasm. Sarcasm often entails saying the opposite of the truth. Usually when people say this phrase, there is an underlying element of sarcasm and/or defiance. Thus, I could care less = I couldn't care less. So Jaime was just letting his inner teenager out.
390	Asarlai	2011-06-05	Good lord.

No need to spread a layer of sarcasm on a phrase that's already pretty biting like "I couldn't care less".  But it's not a big deal.
392	Aoife	2011-06-05	A joke you made, right?  RIght?  Right?/shocked.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':shocked:' />No, but it is just conjecture as to what some of the responses might be, rather than "Oh, George wrote it, therefore I/we have no objections."ETA: Haha. Just as I hit post, I read this on Not A Blog:In a series like this, scenes sometimes get moved from episode to episode, so not everything you'll see tonight will be mine(except in the sense that is all based on my books, of course). F'rinstance, the bit in the previews, with Tyrion and Bronn in the Mountains of the Moon, that was originally meant to be in episode seven, and was moved into "The Pointy End" during editing. So that scene, and the encounter with the clansmen, was written by David and Dan.So there you go, one more reason people might give, rather than just accept as-is.

393	El Hajjaj	2011-05-24	Watching Episode 7 last night, I was flabbergasted that they cut three clauses out of the Night's Watch oath!"Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come."Why the hell would they do that? It wouldn't have taken more than 10 seconds of screen time -- time that could easily have been cut out of the Littlefinger Ass-play extravaganza. I'm more confused than anything.Anyone have any idea why the screenwriters/directors/editors made this decision? Anyone else notice this omission? "I am the horn that wakes the sleepers" is my favorite part!
394	OneTrueWarg	2011-05-29	That's because social media would rather see two girls in a stupid lesbian scene then listen to two dudes talk to a tree. No matter how important it is to Jon Snow later in the series
395	The Scabbard Of the Morning	2011-05-29	Changing the vows was stupid, I have to agree.  The time they saved on that wasn't worth it.
396	Bowl o' Brown	2011-05-29	They shortened it because they couldn't figure out how to get Ros to the wall in time.
Which they would have done strictly to better the development of Jon and Sam of course.
Saying vows of celibacy has more kick when you do it in front of a naked woman. It is known.

After all, she's become the-most-prominent-character-who-never-was.  I swear, if I see Ros again in the next episode, I'll laugh out loud, no matter what allegedly tense or important stuff is going on.  She's become the Fonz jumping the shark.   Will Ned get out of this sticky situation?  I don't know--where's Ros to let us know?  Will Joff succeed as King, Jr?  Quick, find Ros, she'll clue us in!

398	wandarah	2011-05-30	They shortened it because it really doesn't matter very much, and it's an adaptation, and they knew only a handful of retentive uber-nerds are going to cry about it on a forum.
399	Rand	2011-05-30	A wizard did it.
400	Delta1212	2011-05-30	A wizard did it.Samwell Tarly did it.
401	TheEvilKing	2011-05-30	They shortened it because it really doesn't matter very much, and it's an adaptation, and they knew only a handful of retentive uber-nerds are going to cry about it on a forum.Correct. You lot should simply be glad they left it untouched for the most part.I did hope that scene would be more epic, though. It was pretty boring. They looked bored, reciting the vow.
402	valacirca	2011-05-30	I didn't feel cheated and left wanting from that scene. I felt they captured the oath-taking well enough.That, and the sequence a few scenes before that where Mormont was giving his speech, I thought those parts were very well-adapted from the book.The part regarding Jon's story that disappointed me was how they left out a lot of stuff regarding Jon & Sam's storyline, particularly how Jon & Co. were put into the Night's Watch ahead of schedule and Sam wasn't initially included. Then how Jon talked to Maester Aemon for Sam to be included because Sam would be abused and maligned if left behind without them to protect him.The way they showed it in the show, one would wonder how a wuss like Sam would have made the cut.
403	MountainThatRides	2011-05-30	Eh, it was still alright, though I definitely missed the "horn that wakes the sleepers" line. I don't know if it's that integral or anything, but I always liked the way that sounded. It's harrowing!
404	Mad Queen	2011-05-30	"I am the horn that wakes the sleepers" is one of my favorite parts too and "I am the fire that burns against the cold" will be particularly relevant when Jon and Mormont are attacked by Othor.

405	Starkess	2011-05-30	They shortened it because it really doesn't matter very much, and it's an adaptation, and they knew only a handful of retentive uber-nerds are going to cry about it on a forum.I agree that it really doesn't matter very much--which to me is an argument against randomly cutting part of it. The 2 seconds they saved hardly seems useful, and if there's not really much difference between keeping the whole oath and abridging it, why bother abridging it?I'm not one of those people who thinks that things need to be lifted word-for-word from the book, but when it's something like a standard vow or oath, I think you'd need a good reason to change that. And I just don't see one.
406	Areo	2011-05-30	They cut out the part that I usually forget, so at first I didn't even notice. It's not that big of a deal, I even expected them to shorten it more for the TV show.
What bothered me in this scene was the monotonous way they recited it. Somehow their voices weren't sounding too good together. I really wanted something more solemn. But I guess Drogo's speech balances this out.
407	Mad Queen	2011-05-30	I don't care if they change things for the better, only when they change things for the worse. The missing parts of the vow were a lot better than all the screentime they've wasted on Roz.
408	Tywin's bastard	2011-05-30	I'm surprised people choose to rant on about this when the actual words of the vow are insignificant compared to what the vow represents, plus that there are much more significant details regarding Jon and the Watch that didn't make it. Not that people aren't entitled to think and say whatever they want but I do find myself thinking that the people that dwell primarily on the negatives deserve to be disappointed.
409	Ser Warpechowski	2011-05-30	It was suposed to be epic but it wasnt. Fortunaly DrogoÂ´s speach was good but they couldÂ´ve had made their speach better.
410	aimlessgun	2011-05-30	I actually think the vow is significantly better in the book version, and they screwed up by messing with it. It's not insignificant. They traded 10s of screen time to make a scene worse.
411	MountainThatRides	2011-05-30	I actually think the vow is significantly better in the book version, and they screwed up by messing with it. It's not insignificant. They traded 10s of screen time to make a scene worse.Exactly. On screen, it fell flat. You can blame it on any number of reasons -- the abridgment, the lack of harmony when they spoke in unison, and how the scene felt rather blasA©. There was no emotional punch, no chills running down the spine -- which is what happened when I read that scene in the book.The problem with some of the changes is that they seem entirely unnecessary. The Littlefinger/Roz scene was a waste of like 4-5 minutes. No one needed Littlefinger's motivations clarified; people had an idea about him already -- regarding whether he was trustworthy or not -- and all it did was sap some of the surprise from his betrayal of Ned.Some of the changes don't save them any time or money, like the design of the Eyrie (which they were going to show either way; it was a CGI image, it's not like they had to build anything), certain strange dialogue snips, et cetera. Not that I'm complaining -- I love the show and I think they're doing a fantastic job -- I'm just defending the complaint as a legitimate one. Sometimes the show delivers, but more often than not, the books are the standard to which the adaptation will be compared.
412	Kaitscralt	2011-05-31	Wow, I wish I was surprised that people are upset/angry/confused/whining about such a pointless and meaningless sentence being cut from the scene.
413	Vestrit	2011-05-31	Watching Episode 7 last night, I was flabbergasted that they cut three clauses out of the Night's Watch oath!"Night gathers, and now my watch begins.

I'm more confused than anything.Anyone have any idea why the screenwriters/directors/editors made this decision? Anyone else notice this omission? "I am the horn that wakes the sleepers" is my favorite part!My completely uninformed guess is that it's to do with the rhythm of threes.They've cut it to the person saying they are three things: the sword, the watcher, the shield.Generally, in most speeches and in most writing, things are presented in groups of threes, (I will take no wife, hold no lands, father no children), which gives a nice rhythm and impact. Add in a few more things (the horn, the fire, the light) and it becomes a list, which is boring to hear and hard to retain.Also, a sword in the darkness, a watcher on the walls and a shield are all pretty clear images, they make sense to tv viewers, and they fit clearly with what the NW is presented as being. The horn that wakes the sleepers does refer to a wee part of their job but isn't necessary (or obvious if you haven't read book 2) and could be a bit confusing. The fire that burns against the cold* and the light that brings the dawn are metaphors that don't add much.* yes, yes, jump in with the stuff about using fire when Mormont is attacked later on. But in the vow it is a metaphor

414	Cereal Forel	2011-05-31	So wait, is this a thread about cutting the oath or just another thread about bashing Ros, cuz most of the replies here seem to be "yeah it sucks, blah blah blah I hate Ros"
I thought it was fine, I didn't even notice that they cut part of it.
415	Abaddon	2011-05-31	Not going to say much, other than I thought the scene worked just fine, and I loved the warmth of the rangers and the boys when they hug after the oath.  Saying the vows and taking them seriously is important (obviously) but the Night's Watch are brothers with no one else to depend on.  I thought this captured that perfectly, in very little screen time.
416	Xcorpyo001	2011-05-31	They took out several seconds of screen time from a vow that is very important to the story to put in 5 minutes of LF+naked prostitutes in training(part I don't recall about reading in the books).And to those who say the missing part has no real value or meaning, guess/read again. I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers.First part is a warning that strikes very close to the Others(cold), and the best defense against them(fire). But warning about the enemies that forced the people of Westeros to raise an enormous magic wall and the best way to fight them is not as important than teaching a a whore to pleasure another. I do believe Ros will find all these advices LF gave her very useful when the wraiths will come banging at her door. The light that brings the dawn. You know, the ending of the Long Night, when the Others will finally be defeated...the main reason for which the Night Watch was created, other than a dumping ground for undesirable characters, unwanted heirs(the no wife, no heirs, no crown part) and retirement home for out of use lordlings and knights(no glory). It's not very important for anyone to know the NW will play a big part in that final battle(as they did in the past, in the final assault against the Others).The horn that wakes the sleepers? Bugger that, we don't need to know about any weapon that can be used against an unstoppable army of undead creatures.They should have left the damn vow how it was in the book, or at least keep the part about the Sleepers.

419	JackintheBeanstalk	2011-05-31	I was disappointed with that scene as well, but for a slightly different reason: I think it is one of the most poignant examples of GRRM's talent as a writer. He is such a masterful storyteller, world builder, character developer, suspense weaver...I could go on. Then somewhere out of the gritty, muddy, snow-whorled, bawdy, bloody, and backstabbing land of Westeros, emerges a crystalline jewel of a poem which is that oath. 
I could have at least used some musical score in that scene, to draw attention to its solemnity and sheer beauty. You knelt as boys, now rise as Men of the Night's Watch. This oath is a rite of passage from youth to adulthood, and contrasts with how the other Stark kids got unceremoniously separated and scattered, essentially left to fend for themselves with no transition whatsoever.
I also believe that every word of it is important and symbolic, much like the dreams and prophesies, and even fool's ravings, are. All these characters have individual goals at stake, from simple survival to that cursed Throne. And yet, the stakes are so much higher than many of them know (Dany invasion)...and yet the stakes are looming even higher than that: Even Dany doesn't yet grasp the tug-of-war brewing between the supernaturals reawakening beyond the wall, and at the opposite pole, Asshai.
The warnings are in the oaths and prophesies, but while lots of people have pieces, nobody can see the full picture. There is delicious anticipation for us Bookwalkers, because we have more pieces. For HBO viewers, I think it is a good idea to establish the ultimate stakes, which they did in the prologue, but then periodically to remind us that those stakes are beyond imagining. In this episode, Osha's mutterings about fleeing south helped with that. But that gorgeous and momentous Oath should have been given great significance -- driving home that powerless but resolute boys are tasked to defend the realm, and they take on the responsibility with honor. 
So yeah, I am smarting that they would cut any lines of that oath, and instead give me such loud whore sound effects that it was a chore to listen to LittleFinger's villain speech.
420	spikebrennan	2011-05-31	I did hope that scene would be more epic, though. It was pretty boring. They looked bored, reciting the vow.On the other hand, I was glad that the sound recording of the recitation of the vow was done in such a way that you could understand what they were saying.  It's rather tricky to do this.
421	Bronn Stone	2011-05-31	I think it would be really cool if at some point Sam finds an old copy of the oath and they learn it used to be longer.  That the oath itself becomes one of the the things Mormont laments that the Watch has forgotten.  Not bloody likely, but it would be a great plot point and much better than just establishing they've forgotten how to kill wights with fire and Others with obsidian.
422	aimlessgun	2011-05-31	Wow, I wish I was surprised that people are upset/angry/confused/whining about such a pointless and meaningless sentence being cut from the scene.I'm not sure what your point is. We're not allowed to dislike things? Our reaction to the scene is somehow "wrong" and the way we experience entertainment is "wrong"? Are you saying that because the overall episode is great that it is impossible for there to be any mistakes in it at all? Are you saying that you just dislike reading opinions that don't conform to yours? Clarify, please.
423	Volderon	2011-05-31	Thank god they made the oath shorter...it already sounded lame with both of them saying it together :-p

424	The Anti-Targ	2011-05-31	The important parts of the vow were there: Their watch will not end until they die, father no children, take no wife. All things that Jon fails at to one degree or another.

But we do see--again and again and again and again.....Ros.  /ack.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':ack:' />For real- are they just going to make Ros super mobile have her stand in for all the important whores? And how would she, a whore on turnip wagon from a little town north of nowhere, ever get into Littlefinger's Brothel- which I must imagine is the most prestigious in the seven kingdoms? Are we sure Ros doesn't have tusks??? I think I might have just solved King Robert's murder!
427	reiver	2011-06-01	I know it's super cool to bash people complaining about changes and dismiss their opinions as somehow unenlightened and obsessive but i think GRRMs books are so delicately balanced that every change worries me. 
The core story is good but its the little things that make it great. The innocuous words or actions that serve as foreshadowing, the way you can be suprised by an outcome but look back and see the path to it out in the open, the way that characters and their motivations are kept ambiguous and your opinion of them constantly shifts as they're delayered. The TV show has lost so much of that by laying things bare or skipping lines or whole scenes. It may be a lot of seemingly innocuous things bit for me it makes the show considerably weaker. 
As mentioned it's not as simple as sacrificing depth for accessibility. Adding a few lines in may be utterly meaningless at the time but when future events happen people get a kick out of seeing the meaning in things and it makes rewatches rewarding iff you can recognise portntous lines.
428	Greywolf2375	2011-06-01	I think it would be really cool if at some point Sam finds an old copy of the oath and they learn it used to be longer.  That the oath itself becomes one of the the things Mormont laments that the Watch has forgotten.  Not bloody likely, but it would be a great plot point and much better than just establishing they've forgotten how to kill wights with fire and Others with obsidian.Hadn't thought about it like this, but that would be a very cool reason for change.  When he is searching for the maps, he finds a diary containing the words a brother said 800 years ago.  Interesting idea.
429	Tywin's bastard	2011-06-01	I know it's super cool to bash people complaining about changes and dismiss their opinions as somehow unenlightened and obsessive but i think GRRMs books are so delicately balanced that every change worries me.Dismissing those people's opinions as that they are just trying to be cool is every bit as bad as someone that says that people that don't like things are unenlightened, or saying that criticism is just an attempt to be cool. No fruitful thing will ever come out of that.As for obsessing, that's actually a pretty well suited word for choosing to take part in discussions about some words being missing from a long vow. I can't know what experiences other people have with adaptations from books and I've only seen a fraction of what's been done but this is one of the most faithful adaptations I've ever seen, all things considered, and most adaptations take far more liberties with the source material. If some people expected the show to be able to match the books then I'm inclined to think they had extremely unrealistic expectations. So in my opinion we've pretty much for the first time gotten people willing to put in a lot of money and effort into creating a high quality fantasy series and trying to stay pretty faithful to the books, and we still have plenty of fans spending the majority of their posting on discussing what's bad about it.People are free to have whatever opinions they like and people will honestly think differently about things. I think the people focusing mainly on the positives will generate more enjoyment for themselves than the ones focusing on the negatives so I'm trying to do the former.
430	Hyper	2011-06-01	I think the oath turned out great in the episode... Definitely one of my favorite scenes in the show so far. 
And yes, I have read the books. And I don't think the dropped parts are significant. I find most of the reaction in this thread very amusing.
431	Songlian	2011-06-01	They shortened it because it really doesn't matter very much, and it's an adaptation, and they knew only a handful of retentive uber-nerds are going to cry about it on a forum.That is an uber-mature and balanced way to explain the situation. I tip my hat to you. And to all others who make similar comments. A real help those. But I digress. Yeah, it bothered me a little that they cut down a part of the Vow. They were only a few words, but it just so happened that they were important. I don't think it's such a big deal, no, but considering how much less-important scenes we had in this episode (see what I did there? /tongue.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />), I have no clue why they chose to cut down 5 seconds from that scene. Meh.
432	Morrigan	2011-06-01	Indeed. To those who say that it's such a trivial and minor change and that we shouldn't worry about it because it doesn't matter, well, it's all too easy to flip it backwards and say, "if it's just two lines of text, why DID they remove it?"
Keeping the lines would have not have used more time (5 seconds top) and would have kept the fanboys happy. Plus the lines are cool and well written, so it's not like they removed it because it sounded stupid. So why did they?
Maybe they wrote the screenplay from memory and just forgot the lines? /lol.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lol:' />
433	Bronn Stone	2011-06-01	Keeping the lines would have not have used more time (5 seconds top) and would have kept the fanboys happy. Plus the lines are cool and well written, so it's not like they removed it because it sounded stupid. So why did they?You weren't there.  What if they filmed it both ways and it was unanimous that the longer bit worked less well?   If they tried it and saw it didn't work, I'd give them that leeway.  Sounds like you wouldn't.
434	Abaddon	2011-06-01	You weren't there.  What if they filmed it both ways and it was unanimous that the longer bit worked less well?   If they tried it and saw it didn't work, I'd give them that leeway.  Sounds like you wouldn't.Exactly.  What works well on the written page doesn't always work well when spoken aloud.  The scene is already pretty long, I think it probably dragged with the extra lines.  I doubt they trimmed it to save time for something else, it was probably just a matter of feeling an abridged version worked better.
435	The Knight of Grasses	2011-06-02	Maybe I'm the only one, but I actually liked the fact that Sam and Jon weren't completely in unison while they were saying the oath.  Jon seemed like he was in perfect cadence - rhythmic and flawless in his delivery, while Sam had a couple of clumsy moments, stumbling with the words and falling a bit behind.  I think it reflected their characters very well.
I suppose it could have had a more epic feel, but I thought it was a well done scene.  The embraces between brothers at the end were nice to see.
As for shortening the speech...meh.  I don't care.  I didn't even realize they'd shortened it until I saw this thread.  They might just have wanted to keep it a bit shorter to avoid droning on for another ten seconds.  People generally have short attention spans for that kind of thing on television.  I didn't think it was a big loss.
Also, if you look really close, you can see Ros peeking out of the mouth of the weirwood tree.

I think the people focusing mainly on the positives will generate more enjoyment for themselves than the ones focusing on the negatives so I'm trying to do the former.Well, I can't speak for everyone, but for me, saying "I think they should not have abridged the oath" means simply that, and nothing more. It says nothing about how I view the show as a whole, it says nothing about how appreciative I am about it, and it says nothing about my overall stance on adaptations. So I hope people remember not to extract more meaning from words than exist. Thinking they made a mistake with the oath does not impede me from thinking that the series as a whole is fantastic and being grateful it exists.I think maybe people who jump on 'whiners' in a very negative way amalgate all the complaints they see and create in their head this 'whiners' group which just whines about everything. But it is a totally fictional creation. Some people dislike certain things, other people dislike other, specific things, but nobody spends all their time whining about everything in the show. I understand that on forums there's no way to remember "hey aimlessgun mostly says positive things about the show and said in that one thread that overall he thinks it is amazing", but if you see someone complain I think it's better to assume they love the show as a whole and are just voicing a personal dislike of a certain small part /smile.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />Sorry for the rant, that got long.

Possibly other images -- they used the Heart Tree, but also the Wall, Ghost, the woods, anything applicable to the words and moment.
Just two voices had the opposite effect (though not necessarily bad) of what I expected/experienced it when I read it in the book.  It's one of my favorite moments in the book.
438	Vestrit	2011-06-03	Also, if you look really close, you can see Ros peeking out of the mouth of the weirwood tree. /lol.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lol:' /> Nice work

440	Greylander	2011-05-29	My thoughts...
Although I liked the whole double-meaning thing, and the insight into Petyr's motivation, I think there are two problems with this scene.
(1)  For the viewer who is paynig attention, it gives away his later betrayal.  My non-reader girlfriend says she saw the throne room coming simply because of how Littlefinger said he wanted to "fuck them"... and the main target of "them" was clearly Ned.  
The scene (or a slightly modified version of it) should have come *after* the throne room betrayal, so probably in episode 8.
(2) Valuable screen time.  Every second counts, and they only have so much.  Many people miss the Jon suggesting Sam as assistant to Maester Aemon plotline, and I agree.  You could trade 100 out of 360  seconds spent on Littlefinger's monologue in order to have the Jon/Sam plot.  Not just for its own sake, but also so the whole Jon-to-stewards-not-rangers is set up better, instead of out-of-the-blue at the moment of "graduation".  There are probably other areas where some of that valuable screen time could have been spent.
However, I do not think this is a problem:
That Littlefinger confided his feelings in his employees.  Yes, to be strict, he probably would not be so careless candid about his motives/intentions to *anyone*.  But a certain amount of dramatic license has to be used for this sort of thing if you want to reveal some of what a character is thinking/feeling.  (The same applies to the Littlefinger/Varyis scene in an earlier episode).  Although the books do not provide a Littlefinger POV, they provide a lot of information about his connection to Catelyn, and non-readers need to get that connection.
441	80r	2011-05-30	I actually didn't have a problem with the 'gratuitous sex'.  I didn't find it distracting at all, unlike a lot of other people.  Maybe I'm just more open to sex than others.   /dunno.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':dunno:' /> 
However, it's very early for Littlefinger to be blatantly revealed to the viewers.  Reading from the books, it's not perfectly clear what he's up to until much later.  He's obviously always been suspect, but.. how far is unknown.
442	SpaA<U+009F>vogel	2011-05-30	I think the main problem with it, is that it is too on the nose.  Littlefinger has already telegraphed that he's a slimy shit in the TV show without the removal of all subtlety.  I mean, even in the fourth book I still feel like I'm just seeing the bare outline of his game, but this gives away his primary motivation, something that's still mysterious in the books.  Even aside of him trying to teach the prostitutes how to receive a john, (a scene as gratuitous as the Loras/Renly scene which was equally destructive of a subtle thread in the books) his motivations become very plain the moment he lies right to Ned's face before the throne-room confrontation and puts a knife on his neck after it--why spend all that time explaining it?  
We only have 10 precious hours in this series to explain the book, and it just seems that there was plenty of room for some of the excised subplots that are taken up with redundant sexposition.  (how many times do we need Theon explained for example).  
Shrug.  Hopefully we get extended cuts on DVD that spread the stuff out more.
443	julandro	2011-05-30	This is incredible! Nobody is going to complain about the lesbian scene? I do not want to imagine if they had done with Renly and Loras.
444	Anomandaris86	2011-05-30	If this gets its own thread than I might as well copy-paste my thoughts about it from the main thread.There's one very important comment in that lesbian scene. Littlefinger says he's saving himself for another. Can this be another area where the TV show is spoiling something in the books for us? Originally I thought while reading that Littlefinger might be scheming to make himself Warden of the North and end up marrying Catelyn after all. But then the Red Wedding happened, and he didn't seem all that disturbed by it. In fact, when Sansa tells him to give Harrenhall to Lord Frey in book 4, he simply laughs and says, "Maybe I will." Hardly the attitude of a grieving man. But now with his comment in that scene, it seems that maybe he really did plan on marrying Catelyn. Or was he talking about Sansa? Or someone else entirely?Thoughts? He also could be referring to Lysa, as someone pointed out. Except that after making that comment, he then starts talking immediately about Catelyn.
445	NW Deserter	2011-05-30	I think the biggest thing they could've done it improve this scene is to make sure the focus is on LF through some tweaking with the audio. The sex itself wasn't terribly distracting...both chicks were hot but the sex was tame compared to some of the stuff you can find on the internet. The bigger problem was that they were literally moaning over (and louder than) some of LF's monologue. If they had just toned it down and magnified what LF was saying, at least when he was talking about Brandon, it would've made the scene 10x better.
446	Mad Queen	2011-05-30	I thought it was Lysa. BTW ridiculous scene and bad metaphor too.
447	wolverine	2011-05-30	The scene was extremely ridiculous IMO. Even the thought that LF is saving himself for Catelyn is ridiculous.  I am pretty sure he only treats Lysa and her insanity as a path to power, no real feelings there.
448	Kaitscralt	2011-05-30	I thought it was a bit much, but after reading the reactions of people who watched the episode a week early I thought it was going to be a lot worse. It wasn't unbearable, and I don't think it gave away much.
449	TheEvilKing	2011-05-30	The sex stuff was awesome. I thought Littlefinger's monologue was a bit silly though. He could have been more subtle instead of just recounting his whole backstory.
450	valacirca	2011-05-30	Am I the only one who absolutely hates Aidan Gillen's portrayal of Littlefinger? /dunno.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':dunno:' />
451	Mexal	2011-05-30	Am I the only one who absolutely hates Aidan Gillen's portrayal of Littlefinger? /dunno.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':dunno:' /> Possibly. I love it.That being said, the scene was ridiculous and completely unnecessary. We didn't need to see his motivation though I understand the need to get his back story in.
452	QueenOfThorns	2011-05-30	Maybe I am a complete dunce, but it didn't dawn on me that LIttlefinger wanted it ALL until somewhere in book four, and I read the series twice (so far LOL).  I always thought that he just wanted to get as high as he could, but never thought that he aspired to the throne.  Giving it away this early is not cool in my book.  I like characters that take a while to figure out.
453	Steel_Wind	2011-05-30	My complaint with the scene (taken cumulatively with the earlier scenes in the brothel) is that non-readers have now been introduced to Littlefinger as "the Pimp" and he will be remembered that way by viewers in subsequent episodes and seasons.In the books, Lord Baelish had an interest in some brothels, yes, but those were just a few investments among many. He wasn't a pimp, he was simply an urban capitalist who, as "the Lord of rocks and sheepshit", understood that being good at urban commerce was necessary for a man in his position, given his poor lands and rents.So as opposed to portraying Littlefinger as an affable, clever, duplicitous Lord who will engage in urban commerce in a manner which the vast majority of Lords with lands and titles believe is beneath a true nobleman, Littlefinger is protrayed in the TV series as "the Pimp". Instead of The Lord of Rocks and Sheepshit  -- we get "The Lord of Whores". That makes him less admirable, less gray, and more outright villainous to the viewer. That's the part I didn't like. Never mind "play with her ass", they made Littlefinger less complex, less gray, -- and in doing so, CHANGED THE CHARACTER.  I don't think that's a plus.

I don't think that's a plus.Couldn't agree more, and I've been yapping about this on WIC forever. The whole point of Baelish's character was that we weren't supposed to know which side (if any) he would come down on, until the betrayal of Ned.  HERE we have it spelled out in words of one syllable, just in case we're all too stupid to realise it at the end scene, when we're supposed to be (and I WAS when I read the book) shocked!Apart from that - why the hell would one of the court's most secretive and devious characters spout off to random prostitutes his innermost motivations and dreams???  Completely unrealistic. AS is "training" whores in the first place  - I'm sure they know what they're doing, Roz certainly does! - as I've said before, it sounds like No.2 in the "Masturbatory Fantasies for Boys" annual.  The unfortunate thing is that you have to sit through the soft porn if you want to hear Aidan Gillen's monologue, although the groans and moans make it hard to hear at times.On looking back at the furore over the Loras/Renly scene and a bit of off-screen slurping, I wonder what on earth would have happened if they'd been as graphic as this? especially ass-fingering, which would have been pretty usual for them -  I wonder if everyone saying this scene isn't that graphic would have been of the same opinion if it had been the gay couple and not lesbian whores? I'm not a prude, but saying that it wasn't as bad as internet porn means nothing to me, as I don't look up internet porn, but I DO object to having an exposition scene accompanied by women loudly fingering each other etc. I wish D&D and HBO wouldn't write scenes so oobviously geared to a specific audience, or if they do, that nothing important is happening in the scene so I can skip it. And as Littlefinger was a favourite of mine in the book, I'm very sad that his character has been changed from complex to shallow, when it needn't have been.
455	El Phatso	2011-05-30	Agree with Steel Wind completely.  The book portrays LF as someone who is subtle and in control - a master of puppets.  He always has a mysterious aura about him.  This scene portrays him as someone who is desperate, angry, and is on the verge of losing his cool.  All subtelty is wiped away as he lays his cards on the table for all to see.
456	valacirca	2011-05-30	The whole point of Baelish's character was that we weren't supposed to know which side (if any) he would come down on, until the betrayal of Ned.  HERE we have it spelled out in words of one syllable, just in case we're all too stupid to realise it at the end scene, when we're supposed to be (and I WAS when I read the book) shocked!IDK... I felt it was pretty clear in the book as well that it was very likely that LF was going to betray Ned at some point. Hardly a total shock. And in TV series, I don't think it seemed very obvious for non-readers - almost to the point of certainty - that LF's betrayal was inevitable.I think that angle of LF, they translated to the screen pretty well.

457	KarentheUnicorn	2011-05-30	I honestly found the girl on girl action kinda...well..dull.
But other than that the dialogue from LF was interesting.
I actually got the feeling from the dialogue that Littlefinger isn't thinking of Catalyn at all and he's already thinking of Sansa because when he was talking about how Cat saved him from Ned's brother...I sort of got the angry vibe that he was just as mad at Cat as he was for Ned ending up with her.
So, I'm sort of wondering if seeing Sansa for the first time if in his mind this was his ambition all along. That he'd get revenge on Cat for never wanting him by taking her daughter Cat 2.0.
He could be refering to Lysa as well but for some reason I am thinking Sansa more in who he was talking about.
458	madking	2011-05-30	I think it was supposed to come off a little symbolic.  When littelfinger tells the whores that their clients know what they are and know their being lied too that its their job to make the forget what they know.  It mirrors littlefinger and ned and how ned truly doesn't really trust littlefinger and doesn't really buy that he's a friend, but forgets to distrust him too if that makes sense.  One could also say that a whore fingerbanging someone in the ass is also symbolic of what littlefinger does to ned.
459	Steel_Wind	2011-05-30	AS is "training" whores in the first place  - I'm sure they know what they're doing, Roz certainly does! - as I've said before, it sounds like No.2 in the "Masturbatory Fantasies for Boys" annual.  I disagree. Let me explain why I think Littlefinger's "training exercise" is a stealthy bit of context and actually is meant to be a very important scene. A poster on WIC made the observation last Monday that the real utility of the scene is not readily obvious. The real point is not to show Littlefinger is a pimp (though that is the inevitable by-product and why I didn't like it) but to set the viewer up for what is REALLY going on with Tyrion and Shae and how Tyrion allows himself to be deceived. We are about to meet Shae in Episode 8 or 9. Her interaction with Tyrion and the fact that she is faking it on an expert level is explicitly underscored to the viewer in this scene. It is meant to add the underlying unspoken reality to Tyrion and Shae's entire relationship. That aspect of the "whore training" scene's importance to the series is very hard to appreciate prospectively, but once Shae has been introduced -- it frames all of her scenes with Tyrion from Book 1 to 3. We are not supposed to forget it -- but we are told why Tyrion tries very hard to do so.I think this is an extremely valid point and lends more context to what D&D really hoped to accomplish with the scene. So explicit girl-on-girl sex is just fine and even the length of the scene may be excused for this reason. Seen in this light, the problem in how the scene reduces the character of Littlefinger to "The Lord of Whores" is a pernicious effect of the scene and amounts to a (perhaps) unintended "casualty of war". D&D are aiming to illustrate explicitly HOW whores do what they do on an emotional level with their faked enjoyment of sex witth their clients and why their johns are highly complicit in letting themselves be deceived.  Because of Tyrion and Shae, the scene intends to accomplish more than satisfy the prurient interests of viewers.

Everyone knows that whores are faking it, and Shae is particularly obvious, in the books at least. Only Tyrion would fall for her.

Although the books do not provide a Littlefinger POV, they provide a lot of information about his connection to Catelyn, and non-readers need to get that connection.I've just come from the imdb forum which is filled with threads about that scene, pretty much all making the points above.The biggest spoiler for me, from that scene, is not so much for the Ned betrayal (which have been too short & abrupt for LF's betrayal to sink in if not for that "foreshadowing"), but for the "Just Cat."I don't remember the books by heart, and it's been at least half a year since the last time I've read it so bear with me if I'm saying something incredibly stupid.As far as I can remember, everytime LF professed his love for Cat, the reader could doubt his sincerity. He's told it to Sansa for the creepy pedo vibe, to Ned presumably to piss him off, etc.But here, with no apparent gain from this rather ill-timed confession, there's no reason to doubt he's telling the truth and the viewers will therefore know that he's loved "only Cat" all along.As for the "dramatic license" for the sake of establishing background... Well he's already told that story to Ned in ep.3 so there's really no excuse left for this scene...I disagree.

We are not supposed to forget it -- but we are told why Tyrion tries very hard to do so.I think this is an extremely valid point and lends more context to what D&D really hoped to accomplish with the scene. So explicit girl-on-girl sex is just fine and even the length of the scene may be excused for this reason. Seen in this light, the problem in how the scene reduces the character of Littlefinger to "The Lord of Whores" is a pernicious effect of the scene and amounts to a (perhaps) unintended "casualty of war". D&D are aiming to illustrate explicitly HOW whores do what they do on an emotional level with their faked enjoyment of sex witth their clients and why their johns are highly complicit in letting themselves be deceived.  Because of Tyrion and Shae, the scene intends to accomplish more than satisfy the prurient interests of viewers.... except for this.But then they could have left out LF's monologue to focus on the whore training (although I would never have guessed that I would end up defending THAT option).
462	phoenix_rising	2011-05-30	I honestly found the girl on girl action kinda...well..dull.But other than that the dialogue from LF was interesting.I actually got the feeling from the dialogue that Littlefinger isn't thinking of Catalyn at all and he's already thinking of Sansa because when he was talking about how Cat saved him from Ned's brother...I sort of got the angry vibe that he was just as mad at Cat as he was for Ned ending up with her.So, I'm sort of wondering if seeing Sansa for the first time if in his mind this was his ambition all along. That he'd get revenge on Cat for never wanting him by taking her daughter Cat 2.0.He could be refering to Lysa as well but for some reason I am thinking Sansa more in who he was talking about. /agree.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':agree:' />   thats what im saying...
463	Anomandaris86	2011-05-30	I think most readers and viewers would get that just by watching Shae and Tyrion together. Everyone knows that whores are faking it, and Shae is particularly obvious, in the books at least. Only Tyrion would fall for her.She had me fooled.
464	Silverjaime	2011-05-30	[quote name='Steel_Wind' timestamp='1306780691' post='2497204']I disagree. Let me explain why I think Littlefinger's "training exercise" is a stealthy bit of context and actually is meant to be a very important scene. A poster on WIC made the observation last Monday that the real utility of the scene is not readily obvious. The real point is not to show Littlefinger is a pimp (though that is the inevitable by-product and why I didn't like it) but to set the viewer up for what is REALLY going on with Tyrion and Shae and how Tyrion allows himself to be deceived. We are about to meet Shae in Episode 8 or 9. Her interaction with Tyrion and the fact that she is faking it on an expert level is explicitly underscored to the viewer in this scene. It is meant to add the underlying unspoken reality to Tyrion and Shae's entire relationship. That aspect of the "whore training" scene's importance to the series is very hard to appreciate prospectively, but once Shae has been introduced -- it frames all of her scenes with Tyrion from Book 1 to 3. We are not supposed to forget it -- but we are told why Tyrion tries very hard to do so.I don't think it's readily obvious to most people that this scene is foreshadowing Tyrion's relationship with Shae - and nor does it need to.  It's fairly understood by all that the whores are PRETENDING pleasure, as Shae will with Tyrion.  That he chooses not to see it is his own little fantasy.The allegory between what LF is saying about fucking people over, and what the whores are doing, is of course obvious to me, however, I don't have to like how it's portrayed in such detail or at such length, considering the numerous other ways this could have been conveyed, and the time constraints within which to tell the story. The other sexposition scenes I've had no problem with, but the sex in this scene was IMHO both gratuitous and tacky.AND it reinforces the previously-depicted view of Littlefinger as nothing but a pimp - one with delusions of grandeur and huge ambition - but still a pimp, which is NOT how the character appeared in the books.
465	Ellroy	2011-05-30	Worst scene of the series so far and really out of charachter for LF.
466	Lord Mord	2011-05-30	Wow.  Pretty much everything said here against the scene I already agreed with.  It's on the nose, yes, and it un-grays the character.  I'm less concerned about why LF would confide in employees (though for him in particular that seems odd) than I am with the sheer fact of his having any contact with employees down at this level in the first place.When LF opened his first few brothels, okay, maybe.  But the guy now has a whole tax edifice, to say nothing of a massive minting operation to run, books to keep for a whole government, and probably he has dozens of brothels, and lord knows whatever other unsavory businesses besides.  But, he has time to break in and train a couple of new whores by himself, when he must have several regular managers and senior staff besides?  I just thought the scene was sloppy in concept and execution.  The performers did everything they could with it, the direction was okay, but the writing was all over the place.And you know,I don't think we wanted this story, yet, and for sure as hell not from LF himself.  What is this story about?  Is it about sympathy for LF?  That's ruined when you have the boy himself sniveling about it as an adult so many years later.  When I read it in the novel, I seem to recall its purpose was a fake-out, leading me to think that LF had his own kind of honor -- I love this woman so much, I nearly died for her, so if she asks me to help you, much as it galls me, I'll do it entirely faithfully.  Does it serve that purpose in the series?  Hardly -- the image we get instead is of the guy who's only biding his time.And that's not the worst part of it.  The exposition is so long and requires such a steady delivery -- and also struggles so much for attention against the sexo stuff -- I fear that people who don't know what the story is about won't know what's being said, and anyone who listens long enough to get even part of it will tune out the rest when it doesn't seem immediately relevant or likely to change what's happening in this scene.That's about as far as I want to go with this, though.  I like the series, there's still a whole lot of strong points, and quibbling just upsets my stomach.  But ... yes, this scene has some problems.
467	Alcarin	2011-05-30	I really do not understand people here complaining about this scene THAT much...
The point is OFCOURSE it is OBVIOUS to us who read the books... We know what LF does and saying that analogy OFCOURSE WE SAY ''OMG baaam connected everything this will happen''
I watched with 4 friends... and NOONE thought of LF betraying Ned... 
ALSO about he shouldnt be telling what he wants to a whore... Would a whore today or even some random guy you talk in a bar BELIEVE if you told him ''I want everything, whole world'' with an evil grin or would he just thought ''oh another crazy delusional person''
You guys read into this WAY too much. The whores just think he is joking with them, alot or majority of book readers will and DID NOT connect the dots but got a big Deja Vu...
And btw I LOVE Aidan Gillens portrayal of Littlefinger... one of the best casting choices
468	Excellency	2011-06-02	Did anyone else think the scene where Littlefinger is instructing Ros and her friend on how to be better whores was unnecessary and strange?  It did accomplish a couple of things exposition-wise.  We learned that Ros has reached Littlefinger and now Westeros' favorite whore is now working in King's Landing's (apparently) only whorehouse.  We also learned that Littlefinger is bitter about his childhood, his relationship with Catelyn and wants to F his enemies.  But in the process we're treated to some girl-on-girl action more fitting for Caligula.  I mean, when I first heard that GoT was coming to HBO I wondered how bold they would be with some of the sex scenes, but I never imagined they would up the ante and go overboard with it.
It seems out of character for Littlefinger to so willingly reveal his innermost thoughts and feelings, villianous monologue style.  And since when does he waste his time auditioning whores?  And why has the show commited so much screen time to build up Ros into a main character?  I thought maybe when she left for King's Landing she might end up replacing the Shae character in Season two, but I'm told they are casting a Shae.

I just don't remember him swapping the white cloak for a red one, and I think that would have been mentioned. (Or was mentioned, if I've just forgotten about it.)

498	Trebla	2011-05-22	Holy frak. That was awesome. Charles Dance was AWESOME as Tywin. Amusing that he said "lannisters dont act like fools" just as jaime mimiced him saying in ep. 1. nice touch having him skin a deer!this ep was better than ep 6, which was pretty damn good. the end....Oh Ned. Damn your stubborn hide. I wonder if Sansa warned Cersei?So much to digest, watching two hours!

504	Jaime Lannister	2011-05-22	I have Comcast as well and the whole thing loaded immediately and played flawlessly in HD. I suspect some of you have been skimping on your internet connections.
But what an amazing episode. I watched both back to back so they're both kind of blurring together for me.
505	Trebla	2011-05-22	I was at first curious that they had Tywin skinning since he showed so much contempt for Janos Slynt being a butcher's son. But really, lords hunt. That's what they like to do. Tywin should be no different. The butcher remarks are more about him being from small folk.
Also curious that they seemed to have changed Varys' warning to Jorah Mormont about the assassin. It seems like Varys really did send the assassin rather than arrange a setup so Drogo would go to war. 
Pyp is a steward? I wonder if they might combine him with Dolorous Edd in season 2? I can see why (too many characters) but i would greatly miss Edd.
506	Chislev	2011-05-22	For those with Comcast, I was able to watch the episode problem free on the Infinity website. I just went there after HBOGO kept freezing on me.
507	Aoife	2011-05-22	I enjoyed 7 even more than 6 - might be my first 10 of the series. Poor Cat, though; not even her obsessed stalker thinks she's a beauty.Oh yes, Trebla reminded me: I thought it was interesting that they had Dareon among the recruits, but it was Pyp who gave the talk about life not being fair, and he's a singer! I guess they're planting the seeds for later, but condensing material for now.

511	HokieStone	2011-05-22	Pyp is a steward? I wonder if they might combine him with Dolorous Edd in season 2? I can see why (too many characters) but i would greatly miss Edd.On GRRM's "Not a Blog", he hinted in his recent post that he'd be giving hints soon for season 2 casting.  After a comment or two, he made a comment about some of the characters he's seen audition tapes for...and Dolorous Edd was one of them.  So, no, he's not getting cut (at least not right now).
512	Trebla	2011-05-22	Loved the scene between Tywin and Jaime. And they're sending Pyp to the kitchens, just something I remembered from the scene.Right but they might still send him to assist Hake with cooking duties when they go North instead of him staying at the Wall like he did in the book. So he could take many of the lines Edd did since he does seem to be a mummer/singer. Poor Pyp, a Smallwood put his hand on his Little Pypar!
513	Lord Godric	2011-05-22	I have Comcast as well and the whole thing loaded immediately and played flawlessly in HD. I suspect some of you have been skimping on your internet connections.HBOGo announced on their Twitter that they are "aware of the problem and are trying to fix it." Which states it is on their end. Not ours.
514	Dunknegg	2011-05-22	Drogo had me ready to run through a wall for him...the music crescendo accompanying it made my wife say she was getting warm...thankfully, it was near the end of the episode  /leer.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':leer:' />
515	Jaime Lannister	2011-05-22	I wanted to see that bitch Sansa run to Cersei and reveal her father's plans to ship her and Arya away and basically forcing Cersei's hand. That was the one thing I could never forgive Sansa for doing in the books. Betrayed her family because she wanted to be Queen and live a fairy tale life. Now I'm wondering if they're going to leave that part out to try and soften her character. BUt then they throw in the scene with her being a bitch to Septa Mordane and now I don't know wtf they're going for.
516	Trebla	2011-05-22	I think we will get even more complaints of excessive nudity with the LF/Roz/new girl scene. As the scene started, I was thinking the same but as it progressed I felt it worked because we got to see LF's naked ambition. pun intended.
I felt that scene heavily foreshadowed that LF would betray Ned, that he would pick his ambition over doing "the right thing".
517	Balefont	2011-05-22	Fucking awesome!
518	Kaitscralt	2011-05-22	Also curious that they seemed to have changed Varys' warning to Jorah Mormont about the assassin. It seems like Varys really did send the assassin rather than arrange a setup so Drogo would go to war.Could you detail this scene more?

I think this was the best ep. of the series so far.aAgain, Charles Dance was so perfect as Tywin, that pin-you-to-the-wall stare. I loved the writing for Tywin, the way he knows jaime was about to answer with a snarky remark. I'm still geeking over it. As Bale said, FUCKING AWESOME.
521	Blue Steel	2011-05-22	Sean Bean is the most underrated actor in the world.
522	Trebla	2011-05-22	Could you detail this scene more?Before the scene, Ned orders Varys to stop the assassination but Varys says it's too late. In the next scene Dany and Jorah are in the market, Jorah excuses himself and a little boy(little bird) stops him and tells him he has his pardon and hands him a letter. He doesn't open it but goes back and sees Dany talking to the wineseller and stops her from drinking.
523	Aoife	2011-05-22	Is *that* what Littlefinger said in the sexposition scene? Haha, I couldn't hear his lines over the simultaneous porno tryout. Yeah - Ros asks if she [the mystery woman] is beautiful, and LF says something like "Not really, but she has impeccable bloodlines."

I'll have to wait and watch myself (no HBOGO), but Jorah receiving his pardon so early doesn't seem to make sense from the small council's perspective. As to the botched assassination, I'll have to wait and see.
526	Trebond	2011-05-22	Yeah - Ros asks if she [the mystery woman] is beautiful, and LF says something like "Not really, but she has impeccable bloodlines."I am suffering from major information overload - I watched episode 6 at 9pm, then episode 7 at 10pm, then the re-cast at 11pm.Oh my goodness what an epic evening.I keep waiting for Osha to turn her hair pink.

527	Lady Disdain	2011-05-22	I got a strong Randall Tarly vibe with Charles Dance's Tywin but it was really awesome.Finally made it past the opening credits without having to refresh the page!Loving Tywin and Jaime's dialogue in the opening scene, though now that you mention it he does seem a tidge Tarly. Is that a stag he's butchering, or am I just being dim? Could be an elk or something.
528	Slurktan	2011-05-22	By far my favourite episode of the season thus far.  The highlights for me:
- Drogo's speech was fantastic.  Not necessarily the actual speech itself but the actor was fabulous doing it.  Kind of making me want to see Conan more now when it comes out.
- Tywin and Jaime scene was very nice.  Really highlighted how much the character of Jaime is just a floater at this point.  I always pictured Tywin with less hair but Dance was great regardless.  I did think the skinning of the (presumably)stag was a nice touch, the Lion gutting a stag just as it is about to happen to the King.
- I really liked Sam and Jon's swearing of the oath as well.  The Heart tree looked suitably creepy in their only real lasting appearance thus far in the series.
529	HODOR! HODOR!!	2011-05-22	Holy shit that was amazing... and the end was just as terribly depressing as when I read it.  Oh, and I for one am happy that hbogo wasn't working right away because I was gonna watch the episode with my mom, and I think that lesbian scene might have been a bit awkward.
530	Rattle Pants	2011-05-22	Easily my most favorite episode so far! As far as I care they did nothing wrong today (apart from the wonky servers). Highlights for me:
- Tywin! I may have to reimagine the way I picture him in the books. Bravo to the writers.
- Dany's beautiful beautiful eyes. They're not purple, but I really don't care anymore.
- Not one, but two bad ass oaths. Jason Momoa and Sam's actors have won me over. I loved how tender Drogo was in one moment then the mood whiplash hits. Its going to be heart breaking to see him go.
- Ghost!!
531	Trebla	2011-05-22	Osha looks younger than I pictured her but I like the casting. I also liked the scene with her Theon, and Maester Lewin. I think it could play out season 2 if they have her play Mata Hari with Theon, bedding him to further earn his trust and then help the Reeds with Bran and Rickon. We've firmly established that Theon is a horn-dog of the first order.

533	TyrionTargaryen	2011-05-22	We've firmly established that Theon is a horn-dog of the first order.Aren't we all?
534	Lord Godric	2011-05-22	Wow.  By far the greatest episode of the entire season.  That ending season was just absolutely fantastic, I do not think they could have done it better.  I have yet to feel such emotion from this show.  Having just finished that final scene my heart is racing.  It was handled perfectly, the confusion, the betrayal.  Just absolutely perfect. 
A few other notes:
- The offer from Renly was well-played.  You could see how the Loras/Renly scene foreshadowed Renly's sudden lust for power and his escape after Ned refused him.
- I was practically begging Ned to take Renly and Littlefinger's offers.  I knew it would never happen, but I really wanted him to do so.  This episode just made me realize all over again how foolish Ned was. 
- We saw Ghost! I loved the whole weirwood scene, and like the brotherhood that is developing between Sam and Jon.
- Mark Addy's dying plea to Ned was magnificent.  
I am sure there is more I could say, but I need to rewatch the episode because that amazing final scene just cleared everything else from my mind.

536	Rockroi	2011-05-23	I know most people probably already know this but after failing to get on HBO Go for, like 3 hours, I went to Xfinity - you need a Comcast subscription (which I have) and watched the whole episode in hi-def with 0 problems.
537	Huan	2011-05-23	New Lannister motto: "A Lannister always butchers his own meat."
Great episode, except for the scene with Littlefinger, Ros, and her co-worker. I could hardly stand to watch it, it just didn't feel right. Nice background info dump on LF, but really, I never imagined him as being quite so hands on in the brothels he owns.
538	Social Justice Bass	2011-05-23	I liked this episode, although it's not my favorite. I just finished watching episodes 6 and 7 back-to-back, so I'm a little blurry on which was in which. This might sound strange, but Ser Jorah's change of heart and the whole scene with the poisoned wine was my favorite part of the episode. The actor playing him continues to amaze, and the whole scene was just fantastic. Tywin and Jaime's interaction was great, although I'm not so sure about Tywin cleaning a deer while he was at it. I never got the impression from the books that Tywin was the type of guy who would go hunting out of personal desire(I think it would have been better to see him seated over his charts and letters at first). I still think Tywin was well-acted, though. Jon's scenes were great (and I loved how he looked foolish and spoiled when he found out he was put in the Stewards). Sam Tarly continues to be excellent, and his scenes with Jon work very well. That said, I'm sad that they didn't include the scene where Jon gets Sam to be Maester Aemon's personal steward. You saw some of the glimmerings of how he might be a decent Lord-Commander, including his line about the maester's chain and "you can't pound gold/copper into iron, no matter how many times you beat it, but that doesn't mean it's worthless." Since the rest of Jon's scenes went well, it's mostly okay. The whole betrayal of Ned flowed pretty well, although it did seem rather weird to have the confrontation with Cersei near the beginning of the episode. I wish they had included the part where she gets angry with Ned, and asks him "What do you know about honor? You have a bastard of your own".On to Episode 8! A pity it's two weeks away, particularly when you consider that it's the episode that GRRM himself got to write.

It wants me to upgrade silverlight.  I have the latest version of moonlight and it's impossible to tell if it really wouldn't work or their version check script is just broken.I've used hbogo.com several times to watch various things over the past week without problem, but now it doesn't work.  I actually got to watch the first 45 minutes before it crapped out on me and now it forces me to start from the beginning when I try again.  I don't have the patience to wait 45 minutes to see if it will work all the way through.  Can someone explain to me why hulu seems to be capable of delivering perfect picture quality on 50kB/s while HBO seems convinced you need 384kB/s?  That is why their servers are hosed.  I'm not watching on an HDTV, there is no reason I need a 'hi-def' stream.

There's only one fantasy young girl woman for Littlefinger!

Similar to when the stag killed the direwolf, we now have a two-legged lion gutting a stag.
545	ZombieWife	2011-05-23	Wow, they've raised the bar considerably with "You Win or You Die."  I have no quibbles at all about this episode.
It was so well done, such a great build up, and things brought together nicely.
With all the little "seeds" they dropped in the first 5 episodes, things are starting to pay off.  
Kudos all around.  Superbly done.
What stuck out for me (above everything else) was Coster-Waldau's performance.  When Jaime was speaking with Tywin, there was so much there in Jaime, so much that he was emoting through his expression.  For the love of God, give this man a season 3.

546	thorny throne	2011-05-23	Oh, man. I want to watch this NOW.
I love it, how Sean Bean is totally Ned to me now. This is going to be heartbreak all over again when they'd kill him. I wonder if people who haven't read the books can see it coming. He's the fucking hero! He's not suppose to DIE now. They gave him this injury, so that's going to be it, right? Right?
I'm totally gonna cry when they kill him. 
This is just too raw for TV, can't imagine how the red wedding would feel like.
547	LugaJetboyGirl-irra	2011-05-23	I came to the conclusion that the only reason Tywin was gutting the stag was to show how badass he is for the symbolism.  Similar to when the stag killed the direwolf, we now have a two-legged lion gutting a stag.Yes, especially the vivid moment when he cuts the stag's gut wide open and pulls out its entrails, and then later Ned reveals Robert's gaping stomach. A parallel worthy of GRRM.And I have to say I was much happier to see Ghost than I thought I would be.
548	Abolesco	2011-05-23	Anybody notice that Cersei doesn't mention the Baratheon child she supposedly had with Robert that she told Catelyn about? I wonder if they'll mention that in some way down the line. (If it was true or not, primarily)
Another thing in that scene.. as I recall wasn't Cersei idolizing Rhaegar in the books as opposed to Robert? Her formerly great love of Robert feels a bit odd in the scene, though it has been some time since I last read that particular scene in AGoT.
Also, did I imagine Jorah calling Dany by his old wife's name? Good stuff. GREAT episode.
EDIT: I was also glad to see more talking about Stannis, since for the first bunch of episodes he seemed to be swept under the rug for the most part.

549	Rockroi	2011-05-23	I just watched "Win or Die" and its a great episode, I'll have more comments on it in the morning.  
But on watching it again- with the duality between Cercei and Ned's first conversation and their last; then Renly and then LF etc... 
... Seriously, I forgot how woeful Ned was at all this.  When you watch it as fast as this episode went by- from beginning to end -its hard to imagine what, if anything, Ned was thinking.
550	VorianGR	2011-05-23	Oh, man. I want to watch this NOW.I love it, how Sean Bean is totally Ned to me now. This is going to be heartbreak all over again when they'd kill him. I wonder if people who haven't read the books can see it coming. He's the fucking hero! He's not suppose to DIE now. They gave him this injury, so that's going to be it, right? Right?Heh...me and my friends were discussing episode 5 and one of them was like: Of course we know Tyrion won't be killed. He is a protagonist like Eddard!!! How I managed to keep a straight face I don't know.
551	Arya The Assassin	2011-05-23	Episode 7 is also available here (probably for US residents only):http://xfinitytv.comcast.net/
Click on "Episode 7".
552	Winterfelled	2011-05-23	Great episode, as usual. Drogo's promise was awesome, and really fleshed out his character. So far we've seen him grow from a brooding horselord, to a caring husband, and now to a vengeful warrior. Considering how little actual screen time he gets, his growth has been the show's greatest accomplishment thusfar. On the whole, I think the Dothraki scenes have outshone the Westerosi ones, though both sides have been fantastic. 
Ned was frustrating, as always, but only in retrospect. Reading the books, I saw him as noble and righteous and assumed he would be the eventual, inevitable, victor, and I assume the viewers who are new to the series feel the same way. It will come as a great shock to them when he is killed. 
I loved that we saw Tywin field dressing his own kill. Yes, of course, they COULD have shown him at his papers or brooding over a map or something, but that would have been too cliche, even if that's how we met him in the books (though I admit I don't remember how he came on stage in the books). This was a unique introduction, as well as a very nice metaphor.
Going to miss Mark Addy. I never found Robert to be a terribly deep character, since he's already reached the end of his proverbial rope by the time he comes to Winterfell, but Mark gave him a soul, and cast a sympathetic light on his self-destructive behavior. 
Arya continues to steal the show. She might be the finest actor cast. When Syrio thwacks her with the sword, she swallows her words and the pain, and I swear to god I felt it. When someone can let a swallow and a silence speak for them...that's just about as good as it gets, isn't it?
Sam is the other scene-stealer. Not much happened up at the wall aside from the oaths and ghost finding the hand, but Sam really puts a lot of character into his brief appearances.
Sucks we have to wait two weeks now, but I'm used to it. We all are, I think.
553	Sad King Billy	2011-05-23	Oh Littlefinger, how much do I love to hate you. One thing I wonder though: will the intro now show the Lion sigil in King's Landing? 
Speaking of the intro, one thing annoys me, when the camera pans back from winterfell to King's Landing, then it moves to the Dothraki Wastes, it first shows us Vaes Dothrak on an angle, on the left hand side of the screen. Then suddenly, we jump-cut 180Â°, and it's on the right-hand side. For some reason it always annoys me. 
I'm also starting to dislike the exposition-with-boobs style the series is taking. This episode we had Littlefinger and his merry women, the previously we've had Viserys and his slave in bath, and Theon with his whore. Renly's shaving scene (no boobs, for the sake of variety?). It's starting to get repetitive, and they just don't do it for me.  
This is the first time I've seen Renly and not felt annoyed with his portrayal. Hope the trend continues.
554	Arrogant Bastard	2011-05-23	My favorite episode of the series so far. Surprised Tyrion wasn't in it, my guess is they're holding him off so his story about Tysha is in the same episode he meets up with Tywin. This one felt the most faithful to the books, almost every scene seemed like it was lifted right of the page. In terms of action it was actually slower than the last two episodes but the hour still zoomed by, and some really phenomenal  acting all around.
The parts on the wall were great, the guy who plays Samwell is doing a fantastic job and Maester Aemon seemed much more in character than the somewhat grumpy one in episode 3. Great foreboding last shot with Ghost and the hand to set up the next episode. The show also did a good job of setting up Stannis for next season--I wonder if Ned's letter will reach Dragonstone and that will be how Stannis knows of the incest, as they have not indicated yet how he was also investigating with Jon Arryn. 
Aidan Gillen is really impressing me as Littlefinger; I thought he was flat in episode 3 but ever since then he's been perfect. I liked his long monologue, though the Lesbian action was probably too over the top and veering into porn territory. Even though it was another scene of backstory involving sex, Littlefinger's ranting felt organic and not as clunky as others, somewhat reminiscent of Al Swearengen's soliloquies in Deadwood when  he's being serviced by his prostitutes. It wasn't that subtle, but it was fun seeing how his instructions to the whores parallel his own methods. Also, his scene with Ned in the Hand's office was very well done, really enjoyed the way he spins the dagger to point at himself, just like in the book.
The Osha Theon scene was very well done; gives insight into the wildings' view on Westerosi norms and shows how Theon sort of realizes he's not nearly as important as he thinks he is.
Definitely the best segment involving Dany in any episode, loved Drogo's big speech and the wine tasting scene wasn't rushed at all. Up until now and last episode Drogo hasn't really done anything, now he seems like a legitimate part of the show.
The one scene that didn't click for me as much was Ned meeting Cersei in the Godswood; happened kind of abruptly and Cersei doesn't come across as spiteful enough, though the title line was delivered well.
 Finally, the last scene was in my opinion the best single scene of the show so far. Enormous amount of tension even though I knew what was going to happen; loved how the camera lingered on the Hound with his helm on while it was panning the Lannister guards. The kid playing Joffrey is also very good.
It's going to be a long two weeks for episode eight.
555	reiver	2011-05-23	How good is Charles Dance? That first scene is undoubtedly my favourite add so far. It's like it was lifted from a cut portion of the book. One complaint though: Could care less... FFS Americans.
556	Ser Aardvark	2011-05-23	Heh...me and my friends were discussing episode 5 and one of them was like: Of course we know Tyrion won't be killed. He is a protagonist like Eddard!!! How I managed to keep a straight face I don't know.Har! The line I got from my friend was "If Ned dies, I'm so done with this show."
557	Kalbear	2011-05-23	I was pretty annoyed  with the extended Littlefinger/Roz sexposition. At this point I know what GRRM missed; all he needed to do to solve the Meerenese knot was to have a whore PoV. Roz is apparently the most well-informed whore in the entire kingdom; she's privy to Jon's shyness and duty, Theon's power hunger and his plans, Littlefinger's machinations and how he wants to fuck everyone - soon she'll know all about Tyrion's desires too. See? easy to solve. But the scene went on too long, and I didn't think we needed to establish that Littlefinger was a fuckhead.I also didn't like Jon's part in this episode. "The king...is dying. The realm...is close to war. Lords prepare their armies. The Queen admits to incest. And Jon...doesn't get into his favorite class" I know what it sets up, but I think they should have set this up in 6 instead of 7, and maybe flipped this and Tyrion's part. Otherwise it was quite solid, though I too would never have pictured Tywin butchering anything himself. Tywin getting his hands personally dirty just doesn't seem right to me.

559	gbellinator	2011-05-23	I noticed that too. Kinda sad. Makes me wonder if they threw that line in for all the bitching fans did about Cat's casting. I don't think book Littlefinger would ever say that of Cat.I don't think Littlefinger was talking about Cat at that point.  I think he was referring to Lyssa.It is a bit misleading I think.  I think he changes topics after her question of marriage.
560	Ser Aardvark	2011-05-23	I have to file Tywin under the category where characters are different than their description in the book (Lysa, Syrio) but whose physical appearance isn't a key part of their character (Tyrion, Sam, the Clegane brothers) so much as the way the present themselves. It doesn't matter that Lysa is fat, Syrio is bald, and Tywin is large and broad shouldered. The important thing is that the audience understands that Lysa is a complete fruit loop, Syrio is flamboyant, skilled with the sword, but wise, and that Tywin is a hard man who puts the interests of his House above all other concerns. I have to say, in this case, they did a damn good job of getting that across.
561	gbellinator	2011-05-23	New Lannister motto: "A Lannister always butchers his own meat."Great episode, except for the scene with Littlefinger, Ros, and her co-worker. I could hardly stand to watch it, it just didn't feel right. Nice background info dump on LF, but really, I never imagined him as being quite so hands on in the brothels he owns.I agree.  I am no prude, but hated this scene.  Think of all the cool things from the book that we could have had, and instead, we get, "Play with her ass."I could just turn on Skinamax or Showmetime for that...  I love the books and I like the series, but c'mon, treat us with intelligence here.
562	Kalbear	2011-05-23	Oh, don't get me wrong - I LOVE the casting of Tywin. I don't care about him being bald. He looks like a strong, scary guy. That's all that matters. But the butchering seemed a really weird choice for blocking in that episode or in general. One of the things we see Tywin doing always is studying. Studying maps, discussing with his counsellors, reading books, talking to troops, etc. The notion that as he goes to war he'd be all 'hey, let's go hunting' seems so bizarre to me. That's something Robert would do; Tywin takes it way too seriously to allow for something like that. I liked the scene and his conversation with Jaime - it's nice to see that he's disappointed with all his kids and why. But the deer got in the way.(also, Tywin wouldn't have field stripped the thing? Seriously?)
563	Abaddon	2011-05-23	By the time I got to watch Ep. 6 last night it was late, so I put off watching Ep. 7 until this morning.  Looks like it was probably for the best as I had no problems watching it at all.
I haven't even commented in the Ep. 6 thread yet so I'm going to keep this short and will probably post my impressions next week in the "real" thread after re-watching in HD on TV.  Other than the porntastic sexposition scene which was just embarassing, this was the best episode yet.  Brilliant stuff and I can't think of another scene I didn't like, which is a first.  The action has really amped up everywhere and the next three episodes are going to be amazing.
I'm not really bummed about having to wait two weeks for Ep. 8 as we have two episodes to rewatch in the meantime...
564	SerArthurHeath	2011-05-23	This was soooooooooooooo good...
Watched them back to back and can't remember which was which but even characters that seemed a little off before, like maybe Renly, were excellent (he may have been a bit of a wuss in his scene with Loras, but he showed guts here). Plus we saw that there are more than 2 KG
565	Trebla	2011-05-23	My dad's reaction this morning was: "Dany is a strong woman". Emilia Clarke has hit it out of the park the last two episodes. She is starting tgo show that commanding presence that book Dany gets. Her facial expressions when Viserys gets crowned and with the wineseller. I echo whomever said who cares if her eyes aren't purple, they are beautiful. They are and she emotes wonderfully with them.
Arya does indeed steal every scene. Her reactions to Sansa's blathering was priceless. Even Ned stopped briefly to be amused by her. Maise Williams is going to be a rock for this series as she gets even more and more screen time next season and hopefully in season 3.
566	Rockroi	2011-05-23	Win or Die: Maybe the Best episode of the season and for very good reasons.  What I liked:1). Tywin Lannister:Ruler of the Seven Kingdoms.   Apart from a ham-handed metaphor (see below), I thought that they just hit Tywin out of the park.  Not only does he have a keen sense of the current-day realpolitik, but Tywin is obviously a man with his eye on the prize: the security and stability of his family.  Even after dust claims them all.  Dance freakinâ<U+0080><U+0099> owned this part- a scene that lasts all of five minutes.  And I liked how Jaime was used: even the most arrogant of us can turn into children when our fathers are angry with us.  I finally liked how Tywin was far more measured here in his relationship with Tyrion.  Yes, heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a runt, but heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s ONE OF US!  And he explains â<U+0080><U+0093> as if it needed explaining â<U+0080><U+0093>why you cannot just take a Lannister.  And you break that rule at YOUR peril.  Nowâ<U+0080>¦ say something clever.  (small detail I loved: Its cold in the tent: Tywinâ<U+0080><U+0099>s breath can be seen when he speaks.  I love that stuff).  : (small detail I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t like: I know itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a British thing, but how come they say â<U+0080><U+009C>dinâ<U+0080><U+009D>-esty?  It sounds so small).  2). The Warnings to Ned Stark: As I stated above, I really liked how the show unpeeled Nedâ<U+0080><U+0099>s problem in the exact manner of the books.  A stone-headed, honor-bound Ned Stark waltzes methodically to his doom.  The impending doom of Ned is classic because even in retrospect its hard to say that unless you KNOW its coming that one can say they saw it coming.  But look back on Renly and LF and even CERSEI- they all tell him to lay off or to get in good with a power-broker.  Instead?  Boom boom boomâ<U+0080>¦ doom doom doom.  3). Cersei Lannister: Loving the Hate.  The two sides of Cersei Lannister were on full display.  Cersei the wounded woman â<U+0080><U+0093> both physically and mentally.  How she loved Robert and how he hurt her and hurt her.  She then expresses to Ned her wrath: and warns him not to play the game unless he plays to win.  Fifty-minutes later she is sitting atop the dais and making good on her promise.  4. Littlefinger: Just ignore the whores.   If you remove the grotesquely uncomfortable and unnecessary sex scene, LFâ<U+0080><U+0099>s monologue is very telling (and then the writers tie it back together TO the sex scene).  Listen carefully and it all makes sense: what IS LF talking about.  Sex?  Or power?â<U+0080><U+009C>Slowlyâ<U+0080>¦ youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re not fooling them â<U+0080>¦ they know what you areâ<U+0080>¦ youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re job is to make them forget what they knowâ<U+0080>¦ that takes timeâ<U+0080>¦ ease into itâ<U+0080>¦ â<U+0080><U+009C>  â<U+0080><U+009C>Heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s winning you over in spite of himselfâ<U+0080>¦ he knows heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s better than other men â<U+0080>¦ Overcoming youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re very natureâ<U+0080>¦ â<U+0080><U+009C>  â<U+0080><U+009C>because what we donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know usually is what gets us killedâ<U+0080><U+009D> â<U+0080><U+009C>Who could compare to HIMâ<U+0080>¦ heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s just so â<U+0080>¦ goodâ<U+0080>¦.â<U+0080><U+009D>  Seriously, what was brilliant is that we SEE sex, but what is LF really talking about?  Sexâ<U+0080>¦ or his gambles for power?  Whoâ<U+0080><U+0099>s doing the fooling? And who is making the, forget? Because while the right hand was doing one thingâ<U+0080>¦ the left was doing quite another.  A really, really good scene.5. Death of a King: I am just really really happy Addy was Robert.  He was just perfect.  And he, once again and for the last time , nailed his last scene.  I also enjoyed Selmy and how Ned played it.  A really, really good scene.  (Wound should have been bigger, though)(And they should have kept in the lines about how Aerys was worse).6. And Then The Shit Hit The Fan: Climax Was Epic.  Selmy, Cersi, Ned, the Hound, LF. Perfect. What I am iffy on:1. Theon Greyjoy:  King of the Second-to-Last Word: I am really certain I could have done without the vast majority of Theonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s scenes, but I appreciate why they are there.  Just â<U+0080>¦ does he have to be such a stuttering prick?  EVERYONE gets the last laugh on Theon.  And itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a chilling vision of things to come. I just wish it fit in better with what else was going on.  2. AND I was the Last Kid Picked for Kickball!!!!:  Kal said it best, but with everything going on, having to listen to Jon Snow complain about not being a ranger was so sorry and so lame.  It was classic petulant waste.  The story is unfolding tremendously and rapidy and with great peril for allâ<U+0080>¦ and Bitchy McBitcherton is, once again, only concerned with how the world is unfair to HIM!   3. The Words of the Nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Watch: They just seem silly when said in unison and to a tree.   I know thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not right, but I thought it was flat. 4. Tywin Lannister: Keeper of the Obvious Metaphor:  Odd to see Tywin getting his hands so very dirty.  So unlike the book.  I can get behind that.   I just wish the show had been less obvious with what is going on.  Tywin is butchering â<U+0080>¦ a crowned stagâ<U+0080>¦ symbol of House Baratheon.  Any wonder what is going on?  I did not like (and I am sorry):1. The Kahl That Yelled At No One: Its universally agreed that khal Dragonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s speech as epic.  But it, to me, was the worst of both worlds.  First and foremost, in the book, the speech is not to his khaldasar: its to Dany.  Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a slow, smoldering rage, being fed methodically by his rage, but he;s not yelling, heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not carrying ion: its to DANY he is doing this; its for HER!  And so he speaks only to her.  Quietly.  But no louder than he needs to.  The show wrecks it all.  Instead of a determined khal, we have â<U+0080><U+009C>khal Pete Carroll! â<U+0080><U+009C>  I AM SO PUMPED AND JACKED AT WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO!!!"   Why is he yelling?  Heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s the khal!  What is he afraid of?  That they wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t follow?  Its so, so lame.  And then add this: who the FUCK is he talking to?  Remember my constant complaint about the lack of people whoa re, you know, actually IN the hoard?  There are like 20 people in that tent MAX!  Why is he trying to get them so excited?  Why, is he on the radio or something?  It was a terrible clash of â<U+0080><U+009C>better in the bookâ<U+0080><U+009D> and â<U+0080><U+009C>the showâ<U+0080><U+0099>s own limitations stunt what it was trying to do.â<U+0080><U+009D>  I know I am in the minority, but this scene made me only think that the show only gets half of what it is trying to do.

567	Little Grandfather	2011-05-23	Was that Shae with Ros? It looked like the actress they cast.
It certainly sheds new light on whether she was just a whore or not.
568	Queen Dorothea	2011-05-23	I always pictures Charles Dance as Tywin in my head long before the books were written (it's because the guy from the Last Unicorm also looks like him - the nasty guy).
So, it was really strange, this episode seemed to have come right out of my head apart from the brothel scene (I can't stand Ros anymore, sorry for the actress, but always seeing her *** and *** starts making me sick, give us some diversity PLEASE)
I always think it is important to remember though, that non-readers don't know the scene wasn't there and all they need is to know why Littlefinger did what he did.
I missed Arya and Sansa though and I also NEED MORE HOUND!!!
569	Kalbear	2011-05-23	It was not Shae with Ros. It doesn't look anything like the actress for Shae.HEY PORN WOOHOO

571	Wunhopkuendo	2011-05-23	So far, this episode is the worst of the bunch for me and for one reason only: LF's speech. I mean really? Does HBO think all of its viewers are complete morons and need to be spoon fed information or they won't get it? It made LF look less like a schemer and more like a love stuck teenage boy that never got over the captain of the football team beating him up for asking out the head cheerleader. And with all the bloody spies in all of the seven kingdoms, why in the hell would he reveal his plans to his newest whores? I have never complained about any of the inserted scenes, especially with the gratuitous, and much enjoyable, added sex scenes. But this one was just over the top. It didn't flow and it just didn't fit at all. I am a huge fan of baseball, and right now I would say the added scenes are batting about a .900, so if this is all I have to complain about, then not bad at all. Take away the scene, and it is my second favorite, right behind 6.
572	Kalbear	2011-05-23	Oops! Sorry Eef. Link should be fixed and safe for work.
573	Wunhopkuendo	2011-05-23	Oh yeah, and the stag scene was just awesome. I don't really picture Tywin as the hunter Robert is, but I also don't picture Robert skinning his own kills. Tywin is all business. He can effectively skin a stag, which trust me is no easy feat, especially one a table rather than hanging (I have skinned many), and still be able to converse with ease with his son. The symbolism was great and I don't believe people who haven't read the books are are hit over the head with it like some of the other "clues" we have gotten so far. I really liked that scene a lot and love Tywin more than I thought I would when I first saw him in a preview. Now I am just waiting for the PETA folks to have their say.

To be honest, it's so blatant that it makes me wonder just how dumb they expect people to be.Book Petyr: I'm a scheming, clever, witty macheavellian villan.

The way they did the throne scene gives me hope that soon we'll have conniving super bitch Cercei back again.
575	LugaJetboyGirl-irra	2011-05-23	So I imagine the 'Sex in GoT' thread is going to light up next week after this all this 'sexposition.' I have to confess I almost went in and posted there, until I forgot that Episode 7 is still a spoiler.
Now, metaphorically, I can see that the Littlefinger Porn Scene makes sense. I like the point about how Littlefinger wasn't talking about 'taking it slow' sexually, but he was talking about his own jealously/ambition/bid for power. I also like that Littlefinger was telling the girls how to act in a way that was exactly his own method for dealing with people. So not only is the sex a metaphor for Littlefinger's games, but Littlefinger's games are a metaphor for sex. In other words, Littlefinger = a whore.
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to figure this out when watching it myself because the ridiculous moaning was too fucking loud and too distracting. Afterwards, I had no idea what had just happened because I didn't hear most of the dialogue. I have to say that I am surprised so many people think the girl-on-girl bit was way too over the top, although I obviously agree. Besides that it was totally stupid, there were two things that I hated about it:
1) Once again we see hot naked young women. At least we saw the naked filthy wine-merchant for about 3.2 seconds.
2) The girl-on-girl scene was also annoying because it seemed, well, totally unrealistic; it very much seemed to be a male fantasy of how two girls would have sex, which is why it especially felt like it had been cut and pasted from some VHS tape about medieval fantasies.
576	modehead	2011-05-23	I thought this episode was easily the worst of the bunch, and it exemplified all of my fears about this show. Here goes:Robert's death. Just show the hunting scene. The KING died, thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a BFD. We find out second hand? That's not good TV. It's good storytelling when you're writing from a close third person, but this show doesn't have that limitation. Imagine you've never seen this show before. It would make the plot alot clearer if we watched Robert drunkenly fight the boar and Lancel getting him hammered. I think that omission ruined this episode for me, hands down. This isn't the book. Stop trying to be the book.The Littlefinger porn tryout was horrible. A 5 minute long scene, including 3 minutes of "play with her ass." What? They could've made that scene 30 seconds long and still moved the plot where it needed to be: Littlefinger is a pimp and has twisted feelings for Cat. If you need a hardcore porn scene to get that point across, you're failing at making TV.Ned's scenes are borderline parody in this episode. Here are some questions a non-reader is asking: Why didn't Ned tell Robert about his son, even on his deathbed? Why bother warning Cersei? Or, moreso, why didn't Robert keep witnesses in the room when he named Ned the protector? I know GRRM didn't address these issues either, but if I didn't read the books... I'm dumbfounded. Seeing his plot unfold over ten weeks makes Ned's personality faults seem unbelievable.Theon and Asha (osha? I forget) are such minor characters in book 1. That scene could've easily been cut. I wonder what Rob, Arya or Tyrion were up to? 5 minutes with one of them would've been nice.EDIT: The more I think about it, the more I hate that LF scene. The rest I can live with. The LF scene is just horrible TV from every angle I can imagine.

577	End of Disc One	2011-05-23	This was the best episode so far.  Though while I don't have a problem with nude scenes, anal penetration makes me uncomfortable.
578	Kalbear	2011-05-23	The girl-on-girl scene was also annoying because it seemed, well, totally unrealistic; it very much seemed to be a male fantasy of how two girls would have sex, which is why it especially felt like it had been cut and pasted from some VHS tape about medieval fantasies.To be fair, it was Littlefinger trying to teach the whores how to fake it and make it sound more convincing. There was the line 'you be the man' - he was asking them to fake it better and make the guy believe. His coaching wasn't for Roz - it was for the other.Or maybe not. The whole thing seemed a bit juvenile. Littlefinger directing whores in an orgy and telling one to play with the other's ass? Really?

580	A<U+0089>tA©	2011-05-23	Great episode; I love the way Barristan has been brought to the fore and they've made Sansa into a proper little bitch in the last two episodes, as is only right and proper, and I still love Ned and Arya's rapport.Everytime Joffrey's on screen I mutter, "He's such a little shit," pretty much constantly - so good acting, that lad. As ever NMH, but I did actually cheer a little when the snarling helm made an appearance.I thought the LF sex scene and Tywin/Jaime scene could both have been a lot shorter. The Lannister camp looked great though. One complaint though: Could care less... FFS Americans. /agree.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':agree:' />
581	Queen Dorothea	2011-05-23	Great episode;  but I did actually cheer a little when the snarling helm made an appearance. /agree.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':agree:' />So did I but he looked a bit awkward in it, as if he couldn't see well.
582	End of Disc One	2011-05-23	Re "Could care less"...I'm American and this line made me cringe.  I don't know how this made it into the show.
Pardon my bitching...I hate it when other people bitch about minor things.
583	Alcarin	2011-05-23	edit: damn it the board ate my postanyway, I was wondering how people who haven't read the books view littlefinger.

Does anyone who's watching the show with 'newbies' know how they view him?Well my friends who watch show without reading books all agree that Littlefinger is the guy you simply should not trust(what they said after episode 5)But if we go strictly by what TV show us.He himself said:''distrusting me was the wisest thing you've done since you climbed off your horse''To me (who read 1st book 3 times, and 2nd and 3rd once) he comes out as a man he himself explained to be in that brothel scene.''I learned i'll never win, that's their way, their rules........''He plays by his own rules(which is more or less that there are no rules) and in his own way, just like Varys does.The only real difference between both of them is(or atleast its presented in show) that Varys looks like he wants to ''honestly'' help/serve the realm, where Littlefinger wish is to serve the realm but only as long as he has power and control.That look on the throne gave it all away IMO. He wants to have the power of king but probably as the shadow behind the throne.It also feels like Tywin and Littlefinger are roughly similar, they both want power, wealth, etc... but one wants to go through the sword way other through shadow way, and one wants it for the power of their sigil/family another only for himself.
584	RedWeddingCake	2011-05-23	Hehe.  In regards to the the people offended by the Littlefinger Roz scene...do you realize that he is running a high-end brothel?  How do you think he evaluates his employees/slaves, etc?  He teaches them the art.  Guess what; sex really does take place even in Westeros.  Who would have thought?

Who would have thought?Yeah, you know what else takes place in Westeros? People taking craps. It does nothing for the plot, so it's not worth showing on screen.  In 2 years, I'll put up with a scene with Tywin on the john ;-), but other than that, I don't need to see it.I probably would've liked hte episode if that scene was omitted. It was just soooo immature. It just annoyed me. If you're watching this show even half-heartedly, you understand that Littlefinger is a conniving politician. You don't need that scene, at all.  With a plot this big, the writers need to trim the fat. There is just SOOOOO much plot this show has to consider. It feels like an exceptional waste of time to drag that scene out.

That is until the unfortunately terribly written brothel scene. After that, she was not even remotely surprised that he betrayed Ned. She even called it right after he promised to bring troops to Ned, so the betrayal scene in the throne room was not the shock it should have been. A shame really. It could have been so much more powerful and shocking. On a good note, she is convinced that main characters can't die, so the Ned beheading should still come as a shock. She justified the Vyseras killing as "I guess he wasn't a main character and his sister was." LOL.

Whole event played out in a matter of minutes, so i can fully believe Guards could not come....Hell even police doesnt arrive in 5 min after i call them.... atleast in my country
588	The Brandon Stark	2011-05-23	For me it's not even the brothel scene per se, it's the wench that's in it. can we please be done with Roz? WTF? She has been mentioned in 5 or 6 episodes and screen time in at least four that I can think of. How about mentioning Rhaegar or Aurthur Dayne? Hell a little more back story to Lyanna would be nice...
589	KyleLitke	2011-05-23	Really enjoyed the episode.
The one thing that really threw me off, though, was the scene with Jorah, as that completely changes some pretty major things. It could be that's how GRRM intended it, that Jorah got pardoned, but that seems really off to me. It doesn't make sense in the context of "Maybe Jorah will do it for a pardon", it doesn't make sense in the context of "Varys doesn't actually want Dany dead", since Jorah could have just said Fuck you, I've got my pardon and went on his way, and it doesn't make sense in the context of "The Spider wants Dany watched". Why in the world would he have gotten his pardon there? My assumption is that was done to show Jorah making the choice to stay with Dany rather than go home without her, but I can't come up with one good reason, under any of the potential possibilities of what Varys is doing (Varys actually wants Dany dead, Varys wants her watched and helped to put her on the throne, Varys is just legitimately working for Robert), why he would have granted Jorah his pardon then and there. It wasn't in the books and it doesn't make sense, it really threw me off.
Other than that I thought the episode was great.

I didn't say anything about guards or time or what not. I said that the brothel scene ruined the shock of the betrayal in the throne room. What this has to do with the guards coming in time is beyond me. A mistaken quote perhaps?
592	Masha	2011-05-23	Hehe.  In regards to the the people offended by the Littlefinger Roz scene...do you realize that he is running a high-end brothel?  How do you think he evaluates his employees/slaves, etc?  He teaches them the art.  Guess what; sex really does take place even in Westeros.  Who would have thought?The book itself has more than enough of sex scenes, just adding gratuitous nudity and porn scenes and wasting at least 5 minutes on it (very obviously an effort to get one-up on Showtime and its series - Spartacus, Borgia), is really not cool. When I read the books, I thought they were pretty graphic as they were but notice that most of added scenes have to do with nudity and sex. They could have used those 5 minutes to get some of great scenes from the book, but they had to waste it on moaning. BTW. If there was another meaning to Petyr's words, they were wasted on me (and most other views especially those who didn't read the book), was too distracted by the scene and loud moaning.
593	Balefont	2011-05-23	All right, I'll come out and say it: I'm officially sick of seeing Roz again and again.  I don't care how much the producers liked her, it's going too far.  Cast her in something else, like True Blood, if you like her so much but leave her out of my books!
594	80r	2011-05-23	BTW. If there was another meaning to Petyr's words, they were wasted on me (and most other views especially those who didn't read the book), was too distracted by the scene and loud moaning.I had no problem listening to Petyr;  I thought the scene was quite well done, showing how Petyr runs his brothel while simultaneously revealing his backstory.
595	A<U+0089>tA©	2011-05-23	LF's brothels are mentioned plenty of times in the books but I never really pictured him micromanaging personally (guess I assumed he employed competent madams or something), but then again show LF is way sleazier than how I imagined book LF. Both great though.

Both great though.This is what I thought as well.  Littlefinger's brothels are investments to him.  I never pictured him giving whores tips.  That's what madams are for.  I never pictured him doing more than maybe setting prices for services and dictating who gets paid how much.  Remember, Littlefinger is the king's master of coin.  That's easily a full time job.  So's running a brothel.  I just can't picture him of all people getting that hands on with erhm...quality control. /smileysex.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':smileysex:' />
597	Dark Knight	2011-05-23	Great great episode this one. Momoa was EPIC as an enraged Khal Drogo. A shame the Cersei offering herself to Ned was cut.
2 things annoyed me in this one:
-Ghost barking. Really???
-Sam blabbering about girls. What's up with that?! And his overwhelming cowardice isn't really shown in the show. Of all the main characters he's the biggest disappointment along with Theon who instead of being shown as an arrogant brat who conceals his lack of confidence is shown just as a pathetic miserable dude(recoiling when Luwin shows up? really??). I can't imagine how he'll pull off the scene with Asgrid...
598	DurararaFTW	2011-05-23	Well just about every complaint that can be made has been said already, I can focus on the one that I really care about.
They cut Robert saying he made a worse king then Aerys and Ned defending him. WHYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!

Rarely throwing us tits and ass for the purpose of ogling. I suppose there's still plenty of room for that to come in their decadent decline but so far it's been a very good show, better than GoT imo. Spartacus was Starz not showtime and was a mixed bag. I didn't exactly like the way they handled nudity but for some reason it never bbothered me anywhere near as much as GoT's use of it has. If they're trying to one up these programmes in tackiness well fair play to them, i suppose they won.
600	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2011-05-23	I didn't mind ther sex scene, i mean he does run a brothel. Moaning was pretty loud though. Sounded like I was watching a porno. I always thought He simply financed them and gave them the whores, not him actually teaching them.
Other than that I really liked the episode. Drogo's speech was badass. Tywin was awesome, pretty much how I expected him, but didn't think he'd gut a stag, I see the symbolism though.

601	Tywin's bastard	2011-05-23	Finally Jason Momoa got to do something really special as Khal Drogo and he executed that perfectly. Amazing that a long speech in a made up language can be so entertaining and draw you in that much. It really felt like the urge of war stirred in the great warrior and he made it feel like something fierce is going to strike Westeros.Charles Dance is fantastic as Tywin Lannister so it wasn't even necessary to try to try to go for exact likeness. He really got the stern persona across and you can understand why all his children almost fear him, even as adults. Nikolaj did a great job showing emotions with just expressions when Tywin was talking and together they made a great scene that built on both characters, and the events of the story.Ser Jorah also continues to impress and Iain is probably the biggest improvement over the book since his presence as an actor is making me much more emotionally attached to the character, and the connection is happening earlier than in the books.The Borgia's has been, despite the historical opportunity, very tame and tasteful for the most part. Rarely throwing us tits and ass for the purpose of ogling. I suppose there's still plenty of room for that to come in their decadent decline but so far it's been a very good show, better than GoT imo. Spartacus was Starz not showtime and was a mixed bag. I didn't exactly like the way they handled nudity but for some reason it never bbothered me anywhere near as much as GoT's use of it has. If they're trying to one up these programmes in tackiness well fair play to them, i suppose they won.Even if I try I can't see how GoT can come anywhere close to beating Spartacus in that area. GoT has a good deal of exposure but Spartacus isn't really wrongly described as softcore porn, showing more and having much longer scenes that rarely told any story (which basically all GoT sex scenes do).
602	Dremora	2011-05-23	I cant believe people are complaining about nudity...lol
The added scenes are needed to give backstory which can't be given via someones POV, so why not add a few tits in, if you can't concentrate on what he's saying because you're busy watching the women then you cant really complain about the women, it was you who decided that they were more interesting than the dialouge.
603	RDKfromwesteros	2011-05-23	A like the episode, it was awesome, despite the habitual complains
I laugh a lot when i get all nervous in the end, even though i read that part like one hundred times just to be sure of what was happening. I was actually with my heart on the troat hoping it could happen different that time.
Oh sad.

First and foremost, in the book, the speech is not to his khaldasar: its to Dany.  ItÂ<U+0092>s a slow, smoldering rage, being fed methodically by his rage, but he;s not yelling, heÂ<U+0092>s not carrying ion: its to DANY he is doing this; its for HER!  And so he speaks only to her.  Quietly.  But no louder than he needs to.  The show wrecks it all.  Instead of a determined khal, we have Â<U+0093>khal Pete Carroll! Â<U+0093>  I AM SO PUMPED AND JACKED AT WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO!!!"   Why is he yelling?  HeÂ<U+0092>s the khal!  What is he afraid of?  That they wonÂ<U+0092>t follow?  Its so, so lame.  And then add this: who the FUCK is he talking to?  Remember my constant complaint about the lack of people whoa re, you know, actually IN the hoard?  There are like 20 people in that tent MAX!  Why is he trying to get them so excited?  Why, is he on the radio or something?  It was a terrible clash of Â<U+0093>better in the bookÂ<U+0094> and Â<U+0093>the showÂ<U+0092>s own limitations stunt what it was trying to do.Â<U+0094>  I know I am in the minority, but this scene made me only think that the show only gets half of what it is trying to do.Actually, this was my favorite scene of the series, so far.  The emotion from everyone in the room and expression on Dany's face just pulled me in.  I, obviously, didn't see it the same as you and I understood his yelling to be yelling at the heaven/gods.  I think it fit well and conveyed more emotion than the way it was described in the books.
606	Vuron	2011-05-23	Really enjoyed the episode.The one thing that really threw me off, though, was the scene with Jorah, as that completely changes some pretty major things. It could be that's how GRRM intended it, that Jorah got pardoned, but that seems really off to me. It doesn't make sense in the context of "Maybe Jorah will do it for a pardon", it doesn't make sense in the context of "Varys doesn't actually want Dany dead", since Jorah could have just said Fuck you, I've got my pardon and went on his way, and it doesn't make sense in the context of "The Spider wants Dany watched". Why in the world would he have gotten his pardon there? My assumption is that was done to show Jorah making the choice to stay with Dany rather than go home without her, but I can't come up with one good reason, under any of the potential possibilities of what Varys is doing (Varys actually wants Dany dead, Varys wants her watched and helped to put her on the throne, Varys is just legitimately working for Robert), why he would have granted Jorah his pardon then and there. It wasn't in the books and it doesn't make sense, it really threw me off.Other than that I thought the episode was great.I understood the pardon to be "Thank you.  We got your information and will act on it.  Here's your pardon.  Come on home because Dany is as good as dead."edit because I hit enter too soon.  Varys said in his conversation with Ned that the assassination order had already been sent and she was probably already dead.  I think the order was placed and Jorah was given his pardon at the same time.  It would have taken a while to cancel the order.So, I think Jorah did choose Dany over his pardon.

607	SerArthurHeath	2011-05-23	I agree 100%.  Littlefinger's scene just seemed really forced.  I think so far that they've been pushing Littlefinger as the villan a little too hard.  It's far less subtle than in the books.  To be honest, it's so blatant that it makes me wonder just how dumb they expect people to be.Book Petyr: I'm a scheming, clever, witty macheavellian villan.  Don't worry though, I go a long way to make people doubt what I really am.TV Petyr: HEY GUESS WHAT YOU GUYS?!  I'M AN EVIL BASTARD!  /communist.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':commie:' /> That said, I did like the scene at the end with Cercei.  She's been too sympathetic so far in the TV series.  The way they did the throne scene gives me hope that soon we'll have conniving super bitch Cercei back again.I'd agree with you but some people are really stupid. It's not so much the pointing out that LF is bad thing that is annoying in itself (tv shows in general are less subtle than most books, and some viewers would have been clueless otherwise) but because it made it less of a surprise even to clever viewers when Ned was completely screwed over. I know it's clear in the books that he's being really stupid, but as it's from his perspective, we don't see that he has no chance like in the show.
608	SerArthurHeath	2011-05-23	I thought this episode was easily the worst of the bunch, and it exemplified all of my fears about this show. Here goes:Robert's death. Just show the hunting scene. The KING died, thatÂ<U+0092>s a BFD. We find out second hand? That's not good TV. It's good storytelling when you're writing from a close third person, but this show doesn't have that limitation. Imagine you've never seen this show before. It would make the plot alot clearer if we watched Robert drunkenly fight the boar and Lancel getting him hammered. I think that omission ruined this episode for me, hands down. This isn't the book. Stop trying to be the book.The Littlefinger porn tryout was horrible. A 5 minute long scene, including 3 minutes of "play with her ass." What? They could've made that scene 30 seconds long and still moved the plot where it needed to be: Littlefinger is a pimp and has twisted feelings for Cat. If you need a hardcore porn scene to get that point across, you're failing at making TV.Ned's scenes are borderline parody in this episode. Here are some questions a non-reader is asking: Why didn't Ned tell Robert about his son, even on his deathbed? Why bother warning Cersei? Or, moreso, why didn't Robert keep witnesses in the room when he named Ned the protector? I know GRRM didn't address these issues either, but if I didn't read the books... I'm dumbfounded. Seeing his plot unfold over ten weeks makes Ned's personality faults seem unbelievable.Theon and Asha (osha? I forget) are such minor characters in book 1. That scene could've easily been cut. I wonder what Rob, Arya or Tyrion were up to? 5 minutes with one of them would've been nice.EDIT: The more I think about it, the more I hate that LF scene. The rest I can live with. The LF scene is just horrible TV from every angle I can imagine.I strongly disagree with you- in any medium, finding out suddenly from Ned's PoV what happened to robert rather than seeing it creates far more suspense, surprise and emotion for me. If they'd shown him being gored I would have hated it.Lots of people think Ned's actions are ridiculous in the books. I don't think theyve changed that. On TVWP, so far people have gotten that Ned was silly but was doing it because he was honourable. I think the scenes do highlight Ned's choices as foolish but I'm fairly sure that's diberatd and consistent with the source. If you don't like it, your problem is with Ned, not the writers.I'll agree on Theon and on Asha though. I thought the overall tone was EASILY the best episode so far though, in a different league from the first 4 which were also good
609	SerArthurHeath	2011-05-23	Also Robb's already more fleshed out than he was in book 1 anyway and they are setting up Theon so they don't have to waste an episode next season on his character and background, they are establishing Osha as a character to remember. In book 2 I had no clue who Theon was and I'm glad they've avoided this
610	Dremora	2011-05-23	I have no problem with the Theon scenes, if they didn't show them now then it would be hard to explain why he betrays Rob or people would be thinking "whos he?"
I fucking loved Drogos speach, even in a made up language it was epic.
Also don't see a problem with Littlefingers ending either.
This was my fav episode so far.
611	Trebond	2011-05-23	For me it's not even the brothel scene per se, it's the wench that's in it. can we please be done with Roz? WTF? She has been mentioned in 5 or 6 episodes and screen time in at least four that I can think of. How about mentioning Rhaegar or Aurthur Dayne? Hell a little more back story to Lyanna would be nice...This.I'm not a mathematician, but it seems to me like the screen time dedicated to Roz's various private parts has somehow added up to more than that of, oh, I dunno, THE ENTIRE CHARACTER OF SANDOR CLEGANE. NMH.
612	Mad Sweeney	2011-05-23	Wow HBO.. Way to screw the pooch with the big HBOGo promo...You mean they screwed the pooch by actually succeeding in getting a huge amount of people signed up for their service?  Interesting definition of failure.
613	Kaitscralt	2011-05-23	So what's up with the Jorah pardon? It makes zero sense.
614	Ferrum Aeternum	2011-05-23	8/10. Omit Littlefinger/Ros and it's a 10.  Seriously, what was the point of that?  Completely waste 5 minutes of screen time and give away the surprise of LF's villainy in the bargain?  Gee, thanks. Apart from that it was a stellar, gripping hour of television with some of the best storytelling and portrayals we've seen yet.  The opening with Tywin and Jaime was entertaining and effective characterization, proving what added scenes can do.  Jon & Sam's scenes were moving and spot-on in terms of feel.  Drogo's speech was absolutely EPIC, and I have never been a particular fan of his.  A damn shame I'll have to skip that dumbass whore training scene every time I watch this otherwise-gem in the future.So what's up with the Jorah pardon? It makes zero sense.It adds impact to his decision to remain with Daenerys, although at this point it certainly wasn't necessary.  I was lukewarm to it tbh.

NMH.I like your math, NMH indeed. I am just hoping that since Rory McCann's name is in the opening credits that his role is going to expand over time. Not sure how much it will happen this season though.
616	Kaitscralt	2011-05-23	It adds impact to his decision to remain with Daenerys, although at this point it certainly wasn't necessary.  I was lukewarm to it tbh.I agree, it does. But what does the small council get out of it this early? Did Varys forge it maybe, so they lose contact with Daenerys after the failed assassination and she can't be killed?To be honest, I've not even watched the episode. I am just baffled by peoples descriptions of it and I want so hard to understand.

617	End of Disc One	2011-05-23	I think they're doing a perfect job with Theon, and I think Alfie is doing a perfect job with the role.  I don't really understand the complaints other than "waaahh sex scenes."
And I have no idea how Sandor is main cast and Varys is not.  I know a lot of times it has to do with how good your agent is, but I remember reading an article about how Rory McCann was dirt poor and how GoT saved his career...if that's true he wouldn't have had any bargaining power.
618	Hyper	2011-05-23	Great episode - probably the best one yet. 
Some EPIC WIN moments:
 - Tywin's introduction 
 - Drogo's speech
 - The oath of the Night's Watch
 - Ned/Cersei meeting
619	Infidel	2011-05-23	Yeah, you know what else takes place in Westeros? People taking craps. It does nothing for the plot, so it's not worth showing on screen.  In 2 years, I'll put up with a scene with Tywin on the john ;-), but other than that, I don't need to see it.I probably would've liked hte episode if that scene was omitted. It was just soooo immature. It just annoyed me. If you're watching this show even half-heartedly, you understand that Littlefinger is a conniving politician. You don't need that scene, at all.  With a plot this big, the writers need to trim the fat. There is just SOOOOO much plot this show has to consider. It feels like an exceptional waste of time to drag that scene out.It continues to amuse me that sex and nudity are "juvenile" or "immature" and yet beheadings and knives through the eye are just so awesome... /rolleyes2.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':rolleyes:' />
620	Mad Sweeney	2011-05-23	Wow, I can't believe all the whining about the LF scene.  It was well done and nowhere near porn (much less hardcore porn like someone said).  Someone else used a great phrase for it, his complete academic disinterest in anything that doesn't further his goal (or something to that effect).  It revealed a lot about his real personality, not the one that important people see, while keeping with the sexuality of the books.  
Khal's speech was great as well.  I'm going to assume that the dude's not a great actor to begin with so the false language probably helped hide this.  But up until now there was nothing but talk by others about how badass he is, now he's showing it.  I wonder what Dany thinks about his pledge to rape a bunch of their women!
I really like this director, I hope they keep him around for several episodes next year.

You know, how about on KING ROBERT, whose sudden death came by even more swiftly than the books.  I would've loved to see an extra scene of his at his death bed.I had more problems with that LF scene than I did with Viserys' bathtub scene with Doreah.  At least Viserys' scene fleshed him out further as he previously only had dialogue with Jorah or Dany, and let the casual audience know of the significance of the dragons, both as their House sigil and that they used to, but no longer, exist.

622	Impish	2011-05-23	Wow, what an incredible episode.  Another 10 for me.Tywin was great, his manner was just like I imagined from the book.  I liked his introduction, showing how he (literally) has no qualms about getting up to his elbows in blood, and of course the symbolism of the stag is a nice touch.  Jaime was also fantastic here.I didn't mind the LF/whore scene because the dialog was so great, and as someone mentioned even his "sex advice" can be read in an entirely different light.  I do continue to be baffled by why Roz has so much screen time.. but I have faith it's for some meaningful purpose. She could indeed be a replacement for Alayaya maybe?Definitely pictured Osha taller and a bit older, but she is playing the character well so that's the important thing.Finally got some more Night Watch stuff, it was nice how they segued into this from Osha talking about the white walkers.  Watching Jon and Sam say their words at the weirwood tree sent shivers down my spine.The Dothraki scenes were great.  That poor poisoner, hahaha.  And wow, the Khal's speech.  Will definitely be checking out Conan when it comes out based on the strength of that scene alone.Robert's death... epic scene.  Addy did such an amazing job, I am really going to miss him.  All the sudden scheming, Renly and LF, brilliantly realized.  Poor Ned, if only he could have accepted the help being offered him...And then the ending.. man, what can you say.  Just perfect.  My friends gasped audibly when Cersei tore up the paper.  You could hear a pin drop when the gold cloaks drew.  And then everyone starts dying... oh man.  How am I gonna wait two weeks??  /blink.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':blink:' />It's so hard not revealing anything to my non-reader friends.  One of them is dying to know how soon the horse armies invade. /biggrin.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' /> And we were talking about killing off characters (after Jory died), and my friend was like "well I'm pretty sure they're not going to kill NED off.  I mean it's Sean Bean, he's their big star".  Hopefully my reaction didn't give anything away as I stammered out a weak "well.. um.. of COURSE not.. he's the main character, they can't kill HIM off...". /lmao.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lmao:' />  Everyone is going to be so stunned I think.I wanted to see that bitch Sansa run to Cersei and reveal her father's plans to ship her and Arya away and basically forcing Cersei's hand.I was thinking about this too, but in the book it's revealed after-the-fact... so hopefully they will keep that intact when Sansa's fate is thrust to the foreground and she goes kissing Cersei's feet.Besides, not showing this scene when it happens has the same advantage as skipping it in the book; you have no idea what Cersei has up her sleeves until it all goes to hell. /smile.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />

At least Viserys' scene fleshed him out further as he previously only had dialogue with Jorah or Dany, and let the casual audience know of the significance of the dragons, both as their House sigil and that they used to, but no longer, exist.Pointless?  I got a lot of who and what LF is out of that scene.  Who he is for real, when he's not out playing the game, which isn't something that we've really seen yet.  I was riveted to his words while he was both watching but not seeing (or seeing his past/present in their actions) what the girls were doing.  Why do we need more of KING ROBERT?  We already got way more than was in the book and the plotline of his was over.  They already covered him in those previous episodes, anything else with him would be gratuitous even more pointless than you think the LF scene would be since they only have 3 more episodes to conclude the book.  As for gratuity, seriously?  The Land Of Rape and Murder, and you think some boobies are gratuitous?  If HBO did the book as it was written it would get an X rating.  No amount of nipple or blood is gratuitous in this world.  Plus it's HBO.  They do sexy dramas.  Part of the package that comes with having your show on their channel.  His turn at the end should've been seen by a lot of readers/watchers ahead of time since he's an admitted opportunist with no loyalties other than to himself, and with a grudge already against the STARKS and a plan to make a smooth transition of power that NED rejected.

627	Ramsay Bolton	2011-05-23	-Sam blabbering about girls. What's up with that?! And his overwhelming cowardice isn't really shown in the show. Of all the main characters he's the biggest disappointment...I actually really like that they've given Sam a sense of humor in the show. It was hilarious when he asked Pyp to sing him a song. It always somewhat bothered me that the friendship between Jon and Sam felt a bit forced. Jon mostly felt sorry for Sam who was just a mountain of self-pity. In the show their friendship feels more natural despite so little screen time, and Sam feels like a genuinely likable guy. Then again, I'm not a huge purist despite being a fan of the books for 5+ years.

632	Social Justice Bass	2011-05-23	I'm genuinely curious as to where the whole "Roz" situation is going. Is she just our viewpoint on Littlefinger?
I thought the actor playing the Wine-Seller did a great job for a one-shot role.
633	Frumpus	2011-05-23	Doesn't it take months to travel from Winterfell to King's Landing? How did Roz get there so fast?
634	Kaitscralt	2011-05-23	I'm genuinely curious as to where the whole "Roz" situation is going. Is she just our viewpoint on Littlefinger?This isn't a novel... we don't need a viewpoint of anybody. Littlefinger is our look into Littlefinger, since his thoughts are kept from us.
635	aimlessgun	2011-05-23	Funnily enough the Drogo epic speech scene has managed to sell me on Dany. Momoa was awesome but Clarke stole my attention in that scene.  Doesn't it take months to travel from Winterfell to King's Landing? How did Roz get there so fast?She says she's taking a boat. It's still very fast-seeming. Nonreaders seem all over the map on time perception: some do realize that lots of time is going by though.
636	Jaime Lannister	2011-05-23	Doesn't it take months to travel from Winterfell to King's Landing? How did Roz get there so fast?She took a boat like Catelyn did. She tells Theon when he sees her on the onion cart.
637	Lord Godric	2011-05-23	I understood the pardon to be "Thank you.  We got your information and will act on it.  Here's your pardon.  Come on home because Dany is as good as dead."edit because I hit enter too soon.  Varys said in his conversation with Ned that the assassination order had already been sent and she was probably already dead.  I think the order was placed and Jorah was given his pardon at the same time.  It would have taken a while to cancel the order.So, I think Jorah did choose Dany over his pardon.Doesn't that run contradictory to the fact that Varys is supposed to be actually working on bringing the Targaryens back to Westeros?
638	King's Landing	2011-05-23	I can't believe people here are complaining of nudity and Roz?  I liked the LF scene as it was great exposition into his character if you followed the dialog.  As for Roz, cmon, she is good looking and they may be expanding her storyline for season 2 and 3.
This episode was great, best of season for me.  I give it a 10.  Loved the Sam and Jon scenes.  Seen Ghost.  
Loved the Cersei and Ned scene.  "When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die".  
Tywin was perfect.  Not how I pictured him though, but great acting.  Spot on.  Him and Jaime were great in that scene.
Going to miss Addy playing King Robert.  He was fantastic in that role.
Drogo finally had some acting to do in this episode, and it was great.  Also liked the Dany and Mormont scene at the market.
The last scene, my heart went out to Ned like it always does every time I come to this in the re-reads.  Shows you that Ned really made some mistakes in KL as he is honorable and really doesn't understand how to play politics.  Feel bad for him, but it wouldn't be a story without it.
639	Starchaser	2011-05-23	Remember that a lot, probably most, of the viewers haven't read the books. I don't care if you're upset with certain changes, but to me just as important as being faithful is that non-readers like the show. That's how we'll ensure every season to be made, which needs to happen. Things such as more Hound listed above or lack of Tower of Joy are worth complaining about because they'd add more value than a solo Littlefinger scene, sure, but keep things in perspective. 
I even have to explain certain facts to my friend who has read the series, so I'm an encyclopedia for my non-reading friends who love the show. There's a lot going on, a loss of some subtlety is okay. 
My one friend's theory is that Stannis is coming to rescue Ned /biggrin.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />
640	Bowl o' Brown	2011-05-23	My one friend's theory is that Stannis is coming to rescue Ned /biggrin.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />"Why are there 50 ships in the Blackwater?""Screw that chain. I came a book earlier!!"
641	HODOR! HODOR!!	2011-05-23	Doesn't that run contradictory to the fact that Varys is supposed to be actually working on bringing the Targaryens back to Westeros?I'm thinking that since he was telling Illyrio that the Dothraki needed to invade soon, he figured killing Dany would be the best way to make them invade quickly.  This is assuming that he specifically told the assassins not to kill Viserys, and that he never expected Viserys to be killed by Khal Drogo.

644	Jaime Lannister	2011-05-23	And may actually be a Targaryan?  Hence the shaved head to hide hair color?  Hence the name so similar to other Targs?Just thought I'd throw a match onto that old fire.Perhaps he's Dany's mother! Hence the missing man parts!
645	DragonAge93	2011-05-23	Just watched it. I knew what was going to happen to Ned, but seeing it happen on screen my jaw hit my desk like when I read the book. I may know Ned's fate, but it's going to be too hard for me to watch it, as I've stated probably a million times, he is my favorite character, and just reading his death makes it feel like a family member has died (GRRM knows how to connect characters with his readers it seems). Amazing episode, loved the Jon/Wall scenes. Next to Ned, he's my second favorite, so seeing his story now expanding is great. Can't wait for the wight attack next week (I'm guessing it happens in ep. 8?) And Khal Drogo is even more of a badass on screen. Hearing him proclaim his intention to attack the Seven Kingdoms was just bone chilling, and awesome acting by Jason Momoa.
Is it next Sunday yet??
646	King's Landing	2011-05-23	What storyline is that exactly?I mean they may be expanding her storyline.  I believe that everything in the HBO production was ok'd by GRRM.  If that is the case, they may be expanding her role for something or maybe to give us another way into LF's arc.  She could be a spy for LF as I am sure a lot of lords will be coming to her for service.
647	King's Landing	2011-05-23	Is it next Sunday yet??You have to wait for 2 weeks unfortunately

648	Popgun	2011-05-23	Awesome episode. 
I liked the Roz and Littlefinger scene. It showed Littlefinger as a ruthless politician who only cares about himself. Except he has a weakness for Catelyn and an extra dose of bitterness towards Ned. Plus it also implied his growing lust for Sansa and how his love for Catelynn has now moved on to her daughter. "I am saving myself for someone. Someone with impeccable breeding."
The scenes at the Wall were great. Couldn't ask for anything more, Jon only smiles and laughs when he is talking to Sam so it really shows there is more to their friendship than just Jon feeling sorry for the fat guy.
Not sure what my fave scene was. Khal Drogo's speech was epic but I really loved Sam and Jon's vows as well. 
Oh but Ned, Ned, Ned.... I know what happens to him and love him as a character. Still makes it pretty hard to watch when he screws up the political game so bad.

649	Trebond	2011-05-23	If we're going to completely make up juicy sex scenes that never happened in the book and then claim they're the only way to get character development and historical background, I would like to propose that Rory McCann gets stripped down in some future episode. Of course, we would need some other character in the same room loudly quoting an entry from A Wiki of Ice and Fire over the various sexy noises to provide the seemingly-necessary exposition. 
That would shut me up for at least one week.

650	Steel_Wind	2011-05-24	I actually really like that they've given Sam a sense of humor in the show. It was hilarious when he asked Pyp to sing him a song. In all honesty, I think you may have missed the point of Samwell asking Pyp to sing him a song then. It wasn't Sam being funny (or trying to), nor Sam's longing for music.It was Sam being deliberately manipulative and devious. That was a glimpse of Sam Tarly at the end of ASoS. He asked Pyp to sing in order to make Pyp leave so he could finish a private conversation with Jon. If you watch the scene, he appears to be wistful when he asks Pyp to sing, and as soon as Pyp leaves Sam whirls around and continues persuading Jon to stay in the NW without missing a beat.  I loved the part where Sam confesses he "always wanted to be a wizard". Methinks that was some foreshadowing in that scene which GRRM never gave us at that point in AGoT, for the very good reason that GRRM had not yet planned out Sam's longterm character arc. As it has firmed up in the past fifteen years, we now get a much stronger foreshadowing with Sam's one-liner. Sweet!I think John Bradley's Samwell Tarly has been another brilliant bit of casting by Nina Gold et al.
651	smegma	2011-05-24	I am never bothered by nudity or sex on tv, but at first when Ros and whatsherface were about to get busy, I was like...well that seems a bit gratuitous (even though I didn't mind it). But then I was fucking floored by the greatness of Litterfinger's orchestrations of the two women that he gets to fuck each other while he's talking about getting people to fuck one another. His singlemindedness and rantings also brought me back to the good ol days of Swedgen. Loved it. 
I will say that while I don't mind the character of Ros at all, or that she may be Alayaya's replacement - I sorta don't like the actress. I think she's an attractive person and all, but something about her voice and the way she talks with her lips going exaggeratedly forward that kinda annoys me and grates on my ears and eyes. That and her eyes, don't care for them. I don't think she's doing a bad job, but this is the one actor on the show that I'm kinda meh about - but I think that's just me *personally* and not reflective of her actual looks or talent, if that makes sense. But if out of this huge cast she's the only one that I'm not thrilled with, well that's saying something awesome for the show. 
Was there any doubt that Charles Dance would rock? No. He was even better than expected - his gaze is perfecto. Loved NCW in this scene as well. 
I liked Gethin Anthony's performance in this one. I find myself rooting for him and liking him a lot - maybe it's in contrarian response to the negativity that his looks and writing have gotten, but I am loving him more and more. 
I think as of right now that I'm glad that Cersei didn't try to seduce Ned.
652	Trinket	2011-05-24	Tywin was not what I had expected, I had sort of expected him to be bigger and more regent-like. But I really enjoyed this Tywin and it was a really good scene between him and Jaime. 
Tywin skinning a deer, though, does that happen in the books? I can't remember, but it's been a while since I read the series. It seems a bit out of character. Doesn't he have servants to do that? Why is he doing that?
About Ros, I sort of thought she'd be a replacement for Shae somehow.
I'm also really liking both Ned and Bran alot more in the show than I did in the books.

653	Caligula_K	2011-05-24	First the negative: Hated, hated, hated the Littlefinger brothel scene. Least favourite of the series. I am so tired of these dumb sexposition scenes, where the writers essentially insult themselves and the actors by awkwardly interposing gratuitous sex with a character explaining his motivation. And this one was the worst, coming off as exploitative, cheesy and essentially porn. It's too bad, because a scene trying to set up Littlefinger's character is essentially a good idea, but this was completely mishandled, methinks. Also, writers: Perhaps note that the scenes with Roz have been the worst these past three episodes. She was fun in the first Tyrion scene, but she is just not a good or interesting character. 
Otherwise, fantastic episode. Amazing tension throughout all the Kings' Landing scenes. Great acting from Bean, especially in the Robert's death scene (my one minor nitpick with that scene is that I thought it might be effective to emphasize their friendship a bit more).  Charles Dance was great as Tywin. The last scene was done perfectly. Also very much enjoyed the Wall scenes, and am really liking the Sam/Jon relationship, and that they've made Sam more of a normal person in the series (I do like Sam a lot, but not Martin's tendency in the first couple books to make him afraid of everything). Finally, the Dany storyline, which was by far the weakest throughout the first four episodes, is being handled a lot better. Got chills during that Drogo speech towards the end. Can't wait for the amazing events of the last fifth of the book!

But then I imagine her lying next to me whispering in my ear and annoyed would be the last thing I'd be...Drogo's speech was superb and perhaps they should have switched the last two scenes. Yes, Littlefinger's betrayal has more immediate implications, but it wasn't as climactic as the speech. I'll have to rewatch before judging the episode, but I feel episode 6 was stronger. I'll watch again and get back to the topic. Too bad now I'll have to wait 2 weeks for a new episode.

Something that differs someone who really enjoys hunting from someone like Robert who really just wants to kill something. It's not in the book though as we don't see Tywin until the point where Tyrion comes back from the mountains (as Jaime is not yet a POV).There is an actress cast as Shae so they are using Roz for something else.
657	The Warmth of Winter	2011-05-24	When I watched the exchange between Ned and Renly I totally misheard one of Sean Bean's lines.Ned:"I will not dishonor Robert's last hours by shitting blood in his halls!"Me:" /stunned.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':stunned:' />  WHAT THE FU... ooooooh "shedding", lol  /blush.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':blush:' />
658	Demandred	2011-05-24	I was really hoping for Ned to actually get the frak out of King's Landing or take up Littlefinger's or Renly's offers even though I knew he'd say no. 
Just that feeling of foreboding and hopelessness. It makes it worse knowing what's going to happen. I'll just go be sad in the corner.

I did realize that he wanted to get rid of Pyp, but it still made me laugh. It's just one of those lines that in my mind Sam the craven would never have the guts to say, not in that situation.I have to agree the casting is brilliant, and Sam has become my favorite character on the wall. In the books it was the other way around.

660	julandro	2011-05-24	I acknowledge that the series is very good. And not necessary to be very ready to see that the series has made â<U+0080><U+008B>â<U+0080><U+008B>it very clear that Lancel Lannister, is to blame for the death of Robert, and that it is not known until late in the plot when they talk of having sex with Cersei his cousin! Here the scene of the hunt, the eyes of Varys, Barrista Selmy and Eddard, it follows that Lancel is very suspect.
It is a big mistake
661	So1ar	2011-05-24	4. Tywin Lannister: Keeper of the Obvious Metaphor:  Odd to see Tywin getting his hands so very dirty.  So unlike the book.  I can get behind that.   I just wish the show had been less obvious with what is going on.  Tywin is butchering Â<U+0085> a crowned stagÂ<U+0085> symbol of House Baratheon.  Any wonder what is going on?  to the book readers its pretty obvious, but not so much to new viewers. i've talked to a few of my friends who are new to the show and they had no idea that the stag was the symbol of the baretheons.also, i doubt anyone even remembers the deer antler in the neck of the direwolf. there's alot of foreshadowing going on with these symbols, but i doubt new viewers are even thinking about them.

663	Queen Dorothea	2011-05-24	I love Jaime and Tywin in their tent, I think it's all amazingly Lannisterish, and I also like Tywin pelting the stag, since that's what he has actually just done, slay a stag - well, his clan has, but he is the superchief. So now he really takes it all out and over. Great metaphor.
And I totally felt the father-son vibe between Jaime and his father. They are so alike in features and posture and the way Tywin talks to Jaime is amazingly realistc.
664	Lord Varys	2011-05-24	Actually, no, Julandro, Varys and Barristan say exactly the same they do in the book. Varys asked about the wine Lancel gave to Robert, indicating that it might have been more than just wine, and Barristan said it came from Robert's own skin.
If I remember correctly, the truth is revealed when Tyrion questions Cersei about Robert's death at the beginning of ACoK.

665	HokieStone	2011-05-24	So...Tywin dressing the deer - real deer or no?  I can't imagine they would use a real animal for fear of animal rights activists getting up in arms...but it looked pretty darn real to me.
666	Black Sheep	2011-05-24	The Tywin-Jaime scene took something out of Tywin character, I didn't like it very much. It's Tywin moving around the scene too much and dressing the deer. He's supposed to be a brooding silent man, sitting behind a desk and reading.
Actually I would've liked it much more if some servants of Tywin would be in the tent dressing the deer themselves, while Tywin (sitted) and Jaime (standing) are having the conversation occassionally looking at the servants (Tywin regarding it with a pleased but silent expression, while Jaime being all cocky and laughing at it).
That's what Tywin really is - he's a manipulator that has people do the dirty work for him. He had Clegane killing the Targaryen babes,Bolton and Frey executing the Red Wedding. He also commands battle from the rear... IMHO the scene would've been much better that way and the symbolism would've been more accurate.
Otherwise a great episode, I'm excited to see how the rest of the story will be executed in the next three episodes.

I always imaged Tywin as arrogant and thinking he was above the daily mundane duties.  I can see him hunting, but skinning his own deer is below the station of the richest man in Westeros.
670	modehead	2011-05-24	I felt the same way.  I always imaged Tywin as arrogant and thinking he was above the daily mundane duties.  I can see him hunting, but skinning his own deer is below the station of the richest man in Westeros.I think they really wanted that visual metaphor of Tywin slowly skinning the sigil of house Baratheon.  I'm fine with it, as long as Tywin's other scenes establish him as a man who "shits gold."
671	Rockroi	2011-05-24	The below is a comment concerning Tywin's skinning of a stag during the opening scene.  I said that it was an obvious metaphor, Tywin butchering a crowned stag which is the symbol of House Baratheon and its soon to be dead King:to the book readers its pretty obvious, but not so much to new viewers. i've talked to a few of my friends who are new to the show and they had no idea that the stag was the symbol of the baretheons.This is sort of my point: readers will get it and see it as ham-handed; non-readers won't get it and not care at all.  Why do it?I will say that upon a day or two's reflection, I kind of like the butchering; I COMPLETELY agree with everyone else who said that Tywin is a grown man who skins his own kills.  It reminds me of Ian McShane's Al Swearengen in Deadwood- he cleans up his own mess (usually blood stains).  I get the same attitude from this Tywin: he's not afraid to kill, he's not afraid to butcher, and he's not afraid to clean up after.   So...Tywin dressing the deer - real deer or no? I can't imagine they would use a real animal for fear of animal rights activists getting up in arms...but it looked pretty darn real to me.Yeah, upon my review I thought the deer looked really real.  But a few things- first, the animal rights issue would cause an uproar (and then in my mental picture, Charles Dance would have to lay the smack down on them).  But also, there is no way a game, dead deer would last that long in a set-shoot.  With all the takes and retakes Tywin's butchering of the animal would need to be done and then done again and again and again, so a real deer would not be able to be cut and then recut and then cut again.  No way that would work.
672	End of Disc One	2011-05-24	Tywin/stag discussion...nitpicking to the extreme.
673	Guest_Raidne_*	2011-05-24	I'm just dropping in to say that Ep 7 was finally just what I've been waiting for. Riveting television. I imagine it was even better if you've never read the books, but it's hard to say since there were so many moments that were great for book fans, the vows, so many classic lines. Just awesome.
674	Vuron	2011-05-24	Tywin/stag discussion...nitpicking to the extreme.There has definitely been a good bit of nitpicking the first 7 episodes, but I don't think this is one of those instances.  This was Tywin's opening shot in the series and should begin to establish his character.  I noticed and understand the symbolism of him skinning the stag, but I just didn't feel that it would be something his character would do.  I'm not one of the purists, though, so I'm fine that the scene was in there.I do agree with some of the posters that most new viewers probably won't pick up on it and book readers may not agree.I'd also have a problem if they showed Gregor walking around a meadow picking flowers, but I wouldn't go crazy about it.
675	xythil	2011-05-24	Ya um... wheres the scene where sansa betrays ned to cersei?
676	Gnomestress	2011-05-24	Here's a thought on Tywin skinning the stag - the stag is the symbol of house Baratheon.  King Robert has definietely displeased him since the Starks are not punished for kidnapping a Lannister.  Maybe him skinning the stag was meant to be symbolic of his plotting to take out the king.
Edit - Modehead beat me to it.  Great minds think alike?

677	Lord Varys	2011-05-24	The Littlefinger brothel scene actually works way better than any possible scene which would Littlefinger have to confide in to Lothor Brune or Oswell Kettleblack. Combining sex work and Littlefinger's approach to power is a good idea here. Especially as he does not lay out his plans in detail, and only becomes explicit when he confesses that he wants everything. But I'm not sure if it was good to make him a pimp who happens to be good at finances instead of the head of the treasury who happens to own a few brothels to enrich himself.
And I'm not sure if this scene should have been in this episode, before he betrays Ned. I really liked the subtle Littlefinger of the books more, the funny man no one sees as a real threat. Not even the reader, until it's to late. They could foreshadowed his betrayal during the scene where they discussed Stannis and the succession, if they had elaborated on Stannis' giving the Realm a new Hand and a new Council. The audience would have immediately realized that Littlefinger did not want to be fired.
Tywin would never ever skin a stag or another animal himself. He is Tywin Lannister, after all. But I accept this for the sake of symbolism, as it really shows quite nicely how the Lion of Casterly Rock took away the Realm from the Stag, golden dragon after golden dragon. And I'm really thankful that they did not talk about this explicitly.
GRRM uses this symbolism quite effectively himself. And I really do hope they will show us Roose Bolton skinning/hunting wolves.
678	Ramsay Bolton	2011-05-24	I loved the Tywin scene myself, best scene of the episode. Maybe it was because of Charles Dance and his commanding presence though.
I always thought Tywin was first and foremost a ruthless and fiercely proud man, but not someone who wouldn't get their hands dirty. Having him casually skin a stag (quite difficult to do, I'd imagine) while scorning his son shows that this isnt just some rich guy who lent a lot of gold to the throne, but a methodical, dangerous man.
The metaphor was just a fun thing added in there. The point was to introduce a skilled and feared man whose presence makes even the most arrogant knight look like a little child.
679	End of Disc One	2011-05-24	Ya um... wheres the scene where sansa betrays ned to cersei?IIRC that happens later.
680	xythil	2011-05-24	Ya... um Sansa? She didnt betry ned to cersei...
Also... That littlefinger scene was forced. Instead of showing us Littlefinger is a master manipulator... they just tell us.
681	julandro	2011-05-24	Has not bothered me that the lesbian scene has been explicit. But if I get upset with HBO for doing it with two characters that have no importance in history. For example. That scene of nudity would have been better with the queen Cersei and his cousin Lancel. hehehehe.  /laugh.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':laugh:' />

683	AshaÂ<U+0097>Not Yara!	2011-05-24	I don't have a problem with Tywin's scene of skinning the stag. Why couldn't he like the ritual of the hunt and prefer to do the dressing himself? It made him out to be a very methodical man, which he is and I guess I'm a sucker for metaphors because I thought it was great.I'm going to try harder to stay away from these discussion threads as I hate the buzzkill they tend to give me.
684	Ser Latecomer	2011-05-24	Ya... um Sansa? She didnt betry ned to cersei...Also... That littlefinger scene was forced. Instead of showing us Littlefinger is a master manipulator... they just tell us.I find it very likely that in the next episode or two it will be revealed that Sansa betrayed Ned, it just would not have fit in this episode.  The throne room scene works much better if the viewer thinks Cersie has no idea about Ned's plans.  When it is revealed later that Sansa betrayed him, it will have better impact... just like in the books, actually.
685	xythil	2011-05-24	Really?  I don't recall anyone saying "Littlefinger is a master manipulator" or something to that effect.They didnt say the words. They just had a scene about his "Schemeing" when it would have been event without that scene.Scene was pointless and forced.
686	gbellinator	2011-05-24	Ya... um Sansa? She didnt betry ned to cersei...Also... That littlefinger scene was forced. Instead of showing us Littlefinger is a master manipulator... they just tell us.She might not have known she was betraying Ned, but she absolutely went to Cersei to say goodbye and therefore let Cersei know Ned's timeline for striking; thus, allowing her to strike first.She may not have knowingly betrayed the Starks, she didn't lose her direwolf for nothing...

He asked Pyp to sing in order to make Pyp leave so he could finish a private conversation with Jon. If you watch the scene, he appears to be wistful when he asks Pyp to sing, and as soon as Pyp leaves Sam whirls around and continues persuading Jon to stay in the NW without missing a beat.  Wow, you are totally right, and I completely missed that.  God I love this board, thanks for pointing that out!
690	Hombre de Murcielago	2011-05-24	Best episode so far imo.  With the exception of the ridiculous LF brothel scene, this was the first episode that had the 'feel' of the books for me.  The tension in King's Landing was spot on, and Drogo's speech was chilling.  Sam and Jon's vows along with the shot of the face on the weirwood tree was fantastic.
I liked the Tywin scene.  The metaphor was obvious, but appropriate, and I do think that Tywin would skin his own kill.  He's not the type of man to leave the messy bits to others just because he's afraid to get his hands dirty.
691	fall from grace	2011-05-24	She might not have known she was betraying Ned, but she absolutely went to Cersei to say goodbye and therefore let Cersei know Ned's timeline for striking; thus, allowing her to strike first.She may not have knowingly betrayed the Starks, she didn't lose her direwolf for nothing...I don't really think of it as a betrayal. Sansa was a child and really had no clue what was going on, or why her father wanted to send them back to Winterfell. However, iirc, Sansa went to Cersei in part because she wanted the queen to force Ned to allow them to stay in Kings Landing (beside her prince, where, in her mind, she belonged). She was just a spoiled child who wanted her way. I know people hate book Sansa for that act, but I cannot. As far as this episode goes, I loved it!!!!*  I thought the whole story played out really well. It was an awesome episode. Drogo's speech was amazing, imo, and Dany looked strong and beautiful. I wish I didn't know what came next for them. Drogo is too beautiful to die. /sad.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' /> I liked Orsha's talk about what's going on, on the other side of the wall...The Renly/Ned scene played out really well - Renly looked strong and confident. I'm glad they gave us some more of his story and fleshed him out a bit, so we can see some of his motivations, though I know not everyone agrees.Bitch Cersei is back!! Woo hoo! The closing scene was perfect - loved it!! /thumbsup.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':thumbsup:' />*aside from the grunts and moans behind Littlefinger's speech - I'm just pretending that scene didn't happen
692	fall from grace	2011-05-24	If we're going to completely make up juicy sex scenes that never happened in the book and then claim they're the only way to get character development and historical background, I would like to propose that Rory McCann gets stripped down in some future episode. Of course, we would need some other character in the same room loudly quoting an entry from A Wiki of Ice and Fire over the various sexy noises to provide the seemingly-necessary exposition. That would shut me up for at least one week. /ninja.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':ninja:' />Ahhaha!!!  /lol.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lol:' />All the full frontals are starting to make me pissed off that we didn't get one of Jason Momoa. /mad.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':angry:' /> /wink.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />
693	aimlessgun	2011-05-24	The Tywin-Jaime scene took something out of Tywin character, I didn't like it very much. It's Tywin moving around the scene too much and dressing the deer. He's supposed to be a brooding silent man, sitting behind a desk and reading.Actually I would've liked it much more if some servants of Tywin would be in the tent dressing the deer themselves, while Tywin (sitted) and Jaime (standing) are having the conversation occassionally looking at the servants (Tywin regarding it with a pleased but silent expression, while Jaime being all cocky and laughing at it).That's what Tywin really is - he's a manipulator that has people do the dirty work for him. He had Clegane killing the Targaryen babes,Bolton and Frey executing the Red Wedding. He also commands battle from the rear... IMHO the scene would've been much better that way and the symbolism would've been more accurate.Otherwise a great episode, I'm excited to see how the rest of the story will be executed in the next three episodes.I agree completely that Tywin in the books is not at all a man who gets his hands dirty. In every single instance he is pulling the strings, keeping his hands clean, and letting others do the dirty work for him. However, the scene here worked really well. It's a reimagining, but I liked it a lot.
694	Starchaser	2011-05-24	Plus they probably figured, "Gee Tywin's going to be at the council table looking over a map in every other scene, let's diversify here while we can." Whoever keeps complaining about "ham hands" needs to stop nitpicking. We already know what's going to happen. If most of the non-readers don't pick up on it, and I assure you they didn't, then it's not ham-handing.

695	King_Baratheon	2011-05-24	I thought this episode was great. Yes the LF porn audition scene was a little much; they could have had him shout out his intentions without that degree of sexuality in the background (nudity is great, but actual nipple suckage and simulated penetration was over-the-top for me).
A couple things:
Emilia Clarke is BEAUTIFUL, and doing a great job!  /drool.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':drool:' /> 
Arya is awesome, and coming along great  /fencing.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':fencing:' /> 
Again it seems LF has lost all the subtlety that he has in the book  /communist.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':commie:' /> 
They really made it out to look like Drogo will eventually Kick Ass and Take Names /spank.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':spank:' /> 
Though I've read the first four books three times a piece, I still screamed at Ned to listen to Renly /bang.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bang:' />
696	arsonstar	2011-05-24	This was the best episode so far.  Though while I don't have a problem with nude scenes, anal penetration makes me uncomfortable.you just have to relax, dont tense up. /smileysex.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':smileysex:' />
697	Areo	2011-05-24	I have to agree that the sex scenes are becoming annoying at some point. I mean the ones that are used as background for dialogue, history lessons and the like. The ones I can point out are Ros/Theon, Loras/Renly and the lesbo duo orchestrated by Littlefinger (I'm not a homophobe, I actually don't mind seeing two women have sex /wink.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />. All the others come off as more natural, but these are out of place for me, sort of forced. This worked for HBO up to a point and now it's so-and-so and perhaps they need to think about other means of character exposition, background filling and for season 2. I'm not complaining of the overall sexual content in the show but of this specific use of sex, which went slightly out of balance several times (while some scenes were perfect like Doreah/Viserys Doreah/Dany and others).
698	Thefalconemperor	2011-05-24	I don't mind the sex scenes but I was deeply disturbed by Viserys' crowning and even the knife through the eye of Jory.
You know, sometimes I feel the world would be better if more people thought like me.
699	Spionkop	2011-05-24	Did anyone notice when Ned confronts cersie she's shot from below with the sun backlighting her.

700	KyleLitke	2011-05-24	I understood the pardon to be "Thank you.  We got your information and will act on it.  Here's your pardon.  Come on home because Dany is as good as dead."edit because I hit enter too soon.  Varys said in his conversation with Ned that the assassination order had already been sent and she was probably already dead.  I think the order was placed and Jorah was given his pardon at the same time.  It would have taken a while to cancel the order.So, I think Jorah did choose Dany over his pardon.The problem is Varys is the one directly controlling Jorah (this was said in the books, too), which means any pardon Jorah got would have had to come from him (with Robert's permission of course...but point is, Robert wouldn't send it to Jorah himself). And why would Varys want to give Jorah a pardon? It gives him a reason to just leave instead of saving Dany, and it takes away Varys' set of eyes right next to Dany, Viserys (as far as he knows at the time) and Drogo.The only way it makes any sense is if Varys is legitimately trying to kill the Targaryens and thus Jorah has served his purpose, but we have very strong reasons (even from the show) to think that's not the case.

And while Varys is pretending to trying to kill dany, Littlefinger is doing it properly.

705	DurararaFTW	2011-05-24	Varys is the only reason Robert knew about the marriage, the baby, or why that poisoner was there in the books too. I dunno what his game is, and if he really is a Targaryan loyalist, how his actions are to be explained but I'll lay off my critism of the more expliciet nature of the scene here until we do get to see his explanation.
706	Grumkin	2011-05-24	I liked the scene with the two whores getting it on... until littlefinger interrupted them and talked through the whole sex scene! Those girls were doing just fine without your advice, LF!
707	Huan	2011-05-24	Tywin would never ever skin a stag or another animal himself. He is Tywin Lannister, after all. But I accept this for the sake of symbolism, as it really shows quite nicely how the Lion of Casterly Rock took away the Realm from the Stag, golden dragon after golden dragon. And I'm really thankful that they did not talk about this explicitly.GRRM uses this symbolism quite effectively himself. And I really do hope they will show us Roose Bolton skinning/hunting wolves.Yes, Roose's wolf hunt (and using wolf cub fur for gloves!) is exactly what came to mind when I saw Tywin butchering the stag. You can imagine the two men making a pact. Although Roose is more overtly creepy than Tywin, Tywin isn't pretty.
708	Wunhopkuendo	2011-05-24	The LF brothel scene is not bad because of the sex, or his directing, or Roz for that matter. The scene is terrible because it is so unbelievable that he would just lay out his plan (if not the actual method, at least the impetus) to his newest whores. It did resonate a bit like deadwood, which worked very well in that series, but this isn't deadwood and LF isn't Swerengen(sp). The may both keep with the company of whores, but the former lives in a world of spies everywhere, while the latter just lives with whores. I think the HBO stumbled onto something with Deadwood and are attempting to reproduce it here, but it just doesn't work. LF is supposed to be far more subtle than that. But oh well. I hated the scene, but I can certainly move past it seeing how this is the only scene I have hated so far. And hate is a strong word, because I really love hot lesbian action scenes lol. 
As to the purity of the books, people have to understand two things here. First, it is a different medium and must be approached differently than a book written for POV perspectives. And secondly, we have the author consulting here. If anyone has ever written anything in their life, there will never be a time that you don't look over your work and wish you had done something differently. Well, GRRM has that opportunity. He can assist with adding certain lines, or taking away scenes, or developing characters further than he originally had done. Who is to say that many of the changes aren't for this very reason?
I have no idea if the stag is real, but it does look real. And skinning a stag takes a lot of time. It isn't something that has to be done in 30 minutes or the meat goes bad. That is gutting, which is obviously already done. So it might very well be real. It looks cool when Tywin is skinning it, but to be honest, he is only going through the motions. He isn't really skinning much of anything. He just keeps cutting away in the same area. So it could very well be a prop. The fact that an experienced skinner like myself can't even tell for certain is testament to how good the scene was.
709	Huan	2011-05-24	I don't mind the sex scenes but I was deeply disturbed by Viserys' crowning and even the knife through the eye of Jory.You know, sometimes I feel the world would be better if more people thought like me.The first time I read GOT I had nightmares about Viserys' crowning. It bothered me much more than Ned's execution. Seeing it on screen wasn't quite as bad as in my imagination, but bad enough. Viserys' crowning and the posthumous mutilation of Robb and Grey Wind are two of the most disturbing moments in the books for me. I wondered who would actually think of sewing a direwolf head onto a human corpse, and who would actually sit down and do the deed. What a grisly job.

My first read through, I wish I hadn't seen the pictures of him because it made the visceral scenes even that much creepier (not creepy like suspenseful but creepy like Amber Alert).  I didn't have as much troubel with it on the second read, but man the sex scenes and just plain abhorrent violence and violations were hard to reconcile with a dirty Santa Claus in a sailor hat typing away at his computer in nothing but old, dirty whitey tighties.
711	Impish	2011-05-24	Why couldn't he like the ritual of the hunt and prefer to do the dressing himself?Exactly my thoughts. I don't really understand the notion that if someone didn't do something in the books, it's inconceivable their character would ever do it, or that it would a "drastic change" to their character.  It may be a drastic change to some people's interpretation of the character, but that's two very different things.In fact, one thing the books DO tell us about Tywin's personality, is that he does "not believe in half measures"... one could argue that is exactly the kind of trait that might compel someone to clean their own kill... to "finish the job".Did anyone notice when Ned confronts cersie she's shot from below with the sun backlighting her.An Angel........of death  /biggrin.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />Yes!  I thought it was great and symbolized Cersei "attacking with the sun at her back", ie with Ned blinded to the true shape of events.
712	Unsullier	2011-05-24	I haven't seen episode 7 yet, but I've been over-primed by others regarding the LF brothel scene.  I shall offer a preemptive warning to all members of the Westerosi Groupy-osi.
Sooner than you think, My Special Lady Friend Brienne of Tarth shall grace our tv screens, iPads, Xooms, tweets, and just in general emanate into our collective psyches like a mutha-chuggin' Snookie fight.  I am making a playground dibs call on her right now.
She loves me and I love her.  So if they gotta get all the T&A outta the way via Roz, the-artist-potentially-known-as-Chataya, and whatever Apollo Creed wannabe they pull with LF, its a small price to pay in order to keep MY GIRL, Brienne completely pristine. 
I have a Mother Madonna complex about her.  I need her to stay undriven, unbesmirched, and unsullied.
That is all.
713	Ser Greguh	2011-05-24	Haven't read everything but I actually found Littlefinger's "training scene" to be quite good.  The advice he gives to Ros - That the men paying for her know exactly what she is, and exactly what they are paid to do, and that it's her job to convince them over time that this time, much to her surprise, she's actually enjoying it, because this one is a bit special - so perfectly parallels Littlefinger's general strategy.  Everyone knows he's a snake, but he forms his alliances by convincing people that, reluctantly, against his better judgment, he's choosing to look out for their best interests.
Unbelievable episode.  Absolutely fantastic.  I can't think of a single scene for which I have any complaints.  The Night's Watch vows were handled magnificently.  Drogo's speech was handled magnificently.  The final scene was handled magnificently.  Best episode yet, and that's saying something.
714	Tywin's bastard	2011-05-24	In fact, one thing the books DO tell us about Tywin's personality, is that he does "not believe in half measures"... one could argue that is exactly the kind of trait that might compel someone to clean their own kill... to "finish the job".Yes, that's a good point. I wrote earlier in the thread that it can't be very uncommon for a man who likes to hunt (rather than just likes to kill, like Robert) to want to skin the animal himself and it of course goes even more for someone who doesn't believe in doing anything to less than it's fullest. Hunting seems like one of the more common pleasures for noblemen so that in itself doesn't feel out of place either.
715	aimlessgun	2011-05-24	In fact, one thing the books DO tell us about Tywin's personality, is that he does "not believe in half measures"... one could argue that is exactly the kind of trait that might compel someone to clean their own kill... to "finish the job".In my interpretation of Tywin, he most certainly does not believe in half measures. But I don't associate letting someone else skin a stag as a half measure. The job is getting done. That's what's important to Tywin: getting shit done. It would be more pragmatic to have a servant skin the stag and him do tasks which the servants cannot. To me Tywin doesn't seem like the kind of man who has some sense of personal honor that means he has to do it himself. He's actually the antithesis of Ned Stark in that regard.
716	Kalbear	2011-05-24	The other thing about the hunt is that...I just don't see Tywin going off to hunt. Or really do much of anything 'fun'. When there could be any small bit of strategy wrung out of his counselors, or his looking at maps, or really anything - I don't see him taking the time to go and hunt.
As an example, Tywin never leaves Harrenhall's offices. Never. They bring food up to him but he's described as being always in counsel until he leaves.
I think that if he did choose to hunt he'd probably want to excel at it,  but it ultimately depends on what his goal is for hunting. If he wanted to get meat or get something killed, I doubt he'd have any problem letting someone else do it for him. 
It just seemed a bit off to me. It wasn't nearly as bad as littlefinger explaining his psychology to some random whores he just picked up, mind you.

There was so much depth to that scene that I can't help but love it. Fantastic writing.
718	arek	2011-05-24	I enjoyed the episode but a few things do bother me.                                                                                1. Many complain bout brothel scene, I didn't mind lf owning brothels and having cat taken to him there (as it clever place to hide a noble lady) but that scene was unnecessary really. Think would have been better to show Robert getting gored by boar in that 5 minutes. Plus I am getting sick of ros.                                                                                                                                     2. I didn't mind ros scene with tyrion in 1st episode as it helped better introduce his lusty appetites to viewers who are not readers but her scene with theon, the turnip cart and now the brothel I felt were pointless.                                                                                                                                        3. I don't like when they add sex scenes for sake of it like they did in brothel, if they keep doing this then the dany/irri scene that happens in asos will seem to viewers rather then expressing her awakening desire for intimacy after drogo's death that HBO just added another girl on girl scene. I didn't mind doreah scenes in the series as she does teach dany how to be a better lover and liked viserys/doreah scene in bath coz of dragon skull explanation and mention of the names of dragons till u get  to the first three targ dragons.

719	Greylander	2011-05-24	On Tywin dressing the stag:
This is entirely in character for Tywin as presented in the books.  The dressing of the stag itself appears to be a meditation for him (or as others have said, a 'ritual').  It shows him as methodical and without sentimentality.  As to him being "too rich to get his hands dirty" -- where in the books do we ever get that impression of Tywin, other than from the simple fact that he *is* rich?  Part of the reason he is so rich is that he is clearly a no-nonsense, no-frills kind of guy.  He is the type of rich man who will haggle over pennies just on principle.  He is calculating, rigid, absolutely self-disciplined.  It makes sense that he would have some kind of activity like this for meditative purpose -- maybe he skins his own kills because it keep him in touch with the brutal nature of life.
For the attentive viewer, of course, the stag is also symbolic, as many have noted.
720	Kalbear	2011-05-24	As to him being "too rich to get his hands dirty"It's not 'too rich'. It's that he doesn't like getting involved. He uses a lot of proxies and catspaws along the way. He's able to do things like deny that he gave Gregor the order to kill Elia, for instance. He doesn't end up at the Red Wedding but gets the Freys and the Boltons to do his dirty work. He doesn't command from the front but instead finds the best hill to take vantage.It's not about it being beneath him. It's about his mindset. Why would he skin something that someone else could do for him so that he could do something a bit more useful with his time?
721	The Dude	2011-05-24	There's a whole lot of that in my head when I'm reading the books and it all comes down to the fat man with the pedophile beard and the sailor's cap!

He even likes the same type of sailor hat...
722	Vuron	2011-05-24	The problem is Varys is the one directly controlling Jorah (this was said in the books, too), which means any pardon Jorah got would have had to come from him (with Robert's permission of course...but point is, Robert wouldn't send it to Jorah himself). And why would Varys want to give Jorah a pardon? It gives him a reason to just leave instead of saving Dany, and it takes away Varys' set of eyes right next to Dany, Viserys (as far as he knows at the time) and Drogo.The only way it makes any sense is if Varys is legitimately trying to kill the Targaryens and thus Jorah has served his purpose, but we have very strong reasons (even from the show) to think that's not the case.Varys isn't trying to kill the Targaryens.... he's just trying to kill one (Dany).  You have to keep in mind that because Viserys is alive, Dany is meaningless.  She's not the heir and has no real power of her own.  I thought the entire plan of Varys/Illyrio was to kill Dany and her unborn child to goad Viserys/Drogo into invading Westeros.  They wanted to wait but were forced into action because of the rising tensions between the Starks and the Lannisters.
723	PhoenixFlame	2011-05-24	Buahaha, Dany looked so turned on when Drogo was giving his speech. Don't blame her. But yeah, Drogo's scene was awesome. I know he's croaking soon, but at least we'll have Momoa for Conan. 
I'll never get tired of that bloodrider's whip. 
Joffrey's "wtf?!" expression when Robert was dying was priceless.

I didn't mind ros scene with tyrion in 1st episode as it helped better introduce his lusty appetites to viewers who are not readers but her scene with theon, the turnip cart and now the brothel I felt were pointless.                                                                                                                                        3. I don't like when they add sex scenes for sake of it like they did in brothel, if they keep doing this then the dany/irri scene that happens in asos will seem to viewers rather then expressing her awakening desire for intimacy after drogo's death that HBO just added another girl on girl scene. I didn't mind doreah scenes in the series as she does teach dany how to be a better lover and liked viserys/doreah scene in bath coz of dragon skull explanation and mention of the names of dragons till u get  to the first three targ dragons.GRRM didn't "show" the king getting gored, nor his death in the books.  Why would you people (obviously more than just you, many others have stated the desire for more scenes of Robert when they weren't in the book) want stuff that's not in the book, that characters in the show find out when we find out, that are unnecessary in that regard, over well structured double and triple entendre, mood setting scenes with tittilating eye candy as a bonus?  What would showing Robert get gored add to the show?  No one in the books really saw it (POV characters at least) so that exposition is exactly the same as in the books and adds intrigue later on when the discussion of how the King died reaches conspiracy level.  There's obviously a reason they're showing Ros so much.  You're going to have to get used to the idea that with all the character combinings and eliminations that are necessary to transfer this to TV, that she has a bigger role to play.  I highly doubt they have her in the show so much for no reason whatsoever.  You all, for the most part, seem to be largely happy with the show, so show a little faith int he guys that are entertaining you so much that there's a reason for Ros' repeat appearances.  For crying out loud, I never in my 39 years thought I'd ever hear even so much as an eighth so much bitching from fantasy book geeks about TOO MANY BOOBIES being shown on a great adaptation of an all time great fantasy series!
725	Mad Sweeney	2011-05-24	LOL, it could be worse - he kind of resembles my dad. He even likes the same type of sailor hat...Well, if your dad starts writing a book with 14 year old girls getting fingered and all the atrocities (rape and grisly murder especially) GRRM writes about, then you should start getting a little worried.
726	Mad Sweeney	2011-05-24	Varys isn't trying to kill the Targaryens.... he's just trying to kill one two (Dany and son).  You have to keep in mind that because Viserys is alive, Dany is meaningless.  She's not the heir and has no real power of her own.  I thought the entire plan of Varys/Illyrio was to kill Dany and her unborn child to goad Viserys/Drogo into invading Westeros.  They wanted to wait but were forced into action because of the rising tensions between the Starks and the Lannisters.Fixed.
727	aimlessgun	2011-05-24	Buahaha, Dany looked so turned on when Drogo was giving his speech. Don't blame her. But yeah, Drogo's scene was awesome. I know he's croaking soon, but at least we'll have Momoa for Conan. I'll never get tired of that bloodrider's whip. Joffrey's "wtf?!" expression when Robert was dying was priceless. I wish my handwriting looked like Ned's.That was some pretty amazing handwriting.
728	tybeechris	2011-05-24	EXACTLY EXACTLY EXACTLYThese debates are being morphed into some discussion of sexuality and it's place in TV, and not addressing the real problem.I agree, the real problem is time management. Cut the sex, Ros, LF (we got it, he's a creep) scenes some and we can add somewhere else.

730	Borias	2011-05-24	Something I liked about the scene with Tywin is it gives us a better visual of the man.  In the book, it's a bit easier to understand why Tywin is a ruthless head of household.  If all we see him doing is going over letters and maps and scolding his kids, why would he be feared?  However, now we see him doing some pretty decent bloody knifework, at the same time scolding the shit out of the kingslayer.  What we saw is a man that doesn't fuck around.  He gets shit done, and you WILL obey him.  Also, being talked down to by someone carving up a corpse would probably put anyone off their game a bit.
If it happened in a study with him over a book it wouldn't have nearly the same impact.  While most children have automatic deference and respect, and maybe even a little fear of their parents, it doesn't translate well when it's shown 3rd person.(Why is super badass Jaime afraid of the dude in the library again? sort of question)
Oh god.  I can't wait for my non book reader friends to see this episode, and what happens in the following 3.  And they all love Sean Bean so much.....

I can't wait for my non book reader friends to see this episode, and what happens in the following 3.  And they all love Sean Bean so much.....See, I thought the stag part took away that fear for Tywin. He doesn't need to be holding a weapon to be feared. Tywin in the books is to be a stern and harsh man who inspires fear by just being in the room, and by being an authority figure. About him skinning the stag because he is a hunter who likes to do everything himself...I don't think Tywin IS a hunter, at least not on the level that he enjoys it very much. He is not conveyed as a man who has many pleasures in the books. He lives for his work, which is keeping the Lannister name strong. He does not bloody his hand personally, he has others bloodying their hands for him. Gregor Clegane bloodies his hands personally. Tywin doesn't do anything with half measures, but that doesn't mean he has to personally go out and stab the people he wants dead. He pulls his strings and sends his men and whoever he wants dead ends up dead.Tywin gets things done by commanding fear and respect. I also do think that it can be portrayed well on tv, if coupled with good acting and writing. Powerful men have been portrayed on TV before. Throw in some examples of the things Tywin is capable of doing (NOT that he is capable of skinning a stag...I think even westeros women are capable of that considering that this is an age where you cannot buy your meat at the grocery store) and the point will come across even better.

733	Ser Greguh	2011-05-25	well surprise, surprise, people actually aren't so juvenile to be happy about character development being shortchanged for sexscenes.Well surprise, surprise, some of us are mature enough to understand that a scene that has boobies in it is not necessarily also a scene that shortchanges character development.  For anyone paying attention, not distracted by the sex, and that has a brain cell or two to rub together, that scene did almost as much to develop Littlefinger as any one scene has done to develop any character thusfar in the series.  It's one thing if you're a prude and dislike sex or nudity, but don't pretend that anyone that reacts with something other than disgust to a scene that features those things is doing so only because they're a horny teenager.
734	JagfyrBlackfyre	2011-05-25	Quit the bitchin peeplz, this episode was great.  Tywin's introduction was way more formidable than in the books, and I was glad to witness a dialogue that did not occur in the books at all.  The complexity of Jaime's character was well touched upon in the scene, and Tywin provided an interesting opinion regarding the motivations of any ambitious house in Westeros.  Also, why wouldn't Tywin flay a stag as he was doing.  He may prefer to not charge into battle on the front lines, but he is hardly afraid to get his hands dirty by still leading the reserve troops, tending to shae, brutally rendering the reynes of castamere extinct.  
With the Roz-Littlefinger brothel scene, I will admit that it was a tad long in a story where theres so much more to develop on and showcase, but it still made for a great scene.  Littlefinger's motivations are a fascinating element all throughout books as well.  What he is trying to play at can leave even the best reader vexed and excited to see more, so having a scene like this added in was great, as I feel that it added to my perception of him even after being four books deep.  The sex definitely made the dialogue a bit harder to follow (quite a pleasant distraction), but it was still fitting for the locale, for framing what littlefinger says, and within the context of a story that heavily involves whores and brothels as necessary plot elements.  Littlefinger also gets a more sinister mien about him during this scene, which sets up the end of the episode better for a non reader.  We never had a Catelyn chapter detailing Littlefinger's fight with (Big) Brandon Stark in a convenient third person voice, so that history has to get laid out somewhere.  And what better way to do it than amongst a portrayal of superficial and self-serving sex - like the kind Littlefinger likely wanted with Catelyn.  
 Roz is hot and she has a wicked way of portraying her character so seeing more of her is fine by me.  Likely she will be important in developing certain plot elements like the state of kings landing before the blackwater battle, and may even replace chataya or alaya at some point.  Throughout the books, there is little focus on the common folk, and Roz provides a bit of that necessary perspective to get the full picture of this world.
Re-living the tense ending of the episode still evoked the same feelings of outrage I experienced while reading the book, even though I knew exactly what was coming.  I chalk that up to excellent acting more than anything else.  The cast is really great, despite the fact that casting so many odd and colorful characters, as well as less experienced children, seems especially hard to do.  Also Khal Drogo's dialogue near the end was awesome.  I felt pumped to plunder and kick some Westerosi ass after seeing that

In exchange Cersei doesn't kill his baby just because it's Robert's. Which seemed important to me. Robert doesn't lament his poor kinghood as even worse then Aerys', and now never will, and I could go on and on. So no. Just some naked ladies does not make up for that in my opinion. And I'm gonna be very surprised if whatever role Roz is gonna play is gonna change his mind.

And I'm gonna be very surprised if whatever role Roz is gonna play is gonna change his mind.Something I noticed in the TV series is that their approach to events is different from the books.In the books it's: events happens - > consequences happen -> character shows his motivations for doing the event that way.In the tv series its: character shows his motivation -> event happens -> consequences happenLF's betrayal, Ned's death, the red wedding, Renly's "ghost" appearing in the battle of King's Landing, Jofrey's death, etc are examples of this in the books.I think this may be due to a different form of storytelling due to the difference in media. It's a choice the TV show has made. If it's good or bad depends on individual taste. I don't like it, but I understand their choice and understand that they're sticking with it. Also, the TV show doesn't have to mirror the book completely in the reveals. The TV show has used POVs of Cersei and Jaime that appear only in books 3 and 4 to show them in better light than they're portrayed in book 1 (in which they seem almost one dimensional villains).

737	smegma	2011-05-25	As far as the Tywin scene goes, at first I wasn't sure if I was totally on board with the portrayal of him cleaning the stag. For much the same reasons as people have mentioned - that he wouldn't be doing that, he doesn't get his hands dirty, he lets other people clean up his messes, etc. However, I gave it further consideration and I think it was an absolutely epic way to bring in a character that needs to be called attention to. Plus, in addition to the obvious metaphor, it shows him getting shit done. While having a powerful conversation with Jaime. Commanding presence while expertly and without pause dressing his kill. Unforgettable way to bring in a character, and still seeing the Tywin of the books can make sense. 
If you read the Television Without Pity noobs thread, several of them have made comments about who the frig is this Tywin guy that could have fathered these three incredible characters. They are fascinated by him and they haven't had a moment to see him yet - well I think that scene very well introduces "this is the guy that can raise twins that fuck each other and a dwarf with a silvered tongue". Another excellently written scene that was not in the books - these seem to be my favorites!
738	ryamano	2011-05-25	I liked Tywyn's introduction. I thought it was weird that he was dressing the carcass, but still, that scene served to establish so much: his ruthlessness, his desire to be respected, his relatioship with his kids, etc. It also served to convey that this guy can strike fear and awe in the hearts of others. Great choice in the actor, who portrayed Tywyn very well, even if he doesn't look much like what I thought (side whiskers).
739	Tywin's bastard	2011-05-25	The other thing about the hunt is that...I just don't see Tywin going off to hunt. Or really do much of anything 'fun'. When there could be any small bit of strategy wrung out of his counselors, or his looking at maps, or really anything - I don't see him taking the time to go and hunt.As an example, Tywin never leaves Harrenhall's offices. Never. They bring food up to him but he's described as being always in counsel until he leaves.I think that if he did choose to hunt he'd probably want to excel at it,  but it ultimately depends on what his goal is for hunting. If he wanted to get meat or get something killed, I doubt he'd have any problem letting someone else do it for him. It just seemed a bit off to me. It wasn't nearly as bad as littlefinger explaining his psychology to some random whores he just picked up, mind you.But what you're talking about is the official persona of Tywin Lannister, which also tells us that he wouldn't even think of degrade himself by sleeping with a whore. We all know how true that really is. I find it a tad unbelievable that even a driven man would never do something for entertainment, or at the very least to relax himself and clear his head, and my previously mentioned activity shows that Tywin is not made of stone. To hunt is a noble sport for the nobility and skinning the animal yourself is certainly a part of the ritual. The nobles never hunt because they need to, they do it because it's a manly thing to do. I don't think this alters his character in any relevant way.

That has long sex scenes where no other information is being presented (contrary to GoT sex scenes which almost always gives us back story or character development) and it's been constantly growing in viewers. Sex does not turn off many people that would subscribe to HBO since that's a network that doesn't have any double standards when it comes to sex vs violence.As for your quote troubles, you accidentally ended the last tag with a } instead of a ].

HBO has never shyed away from sex - every HBO I've ever seen has had a lot of sex and most of it is gratuitous. Rome always upped the sex and violence scenes when there wasn't much going with the plot. At least with GoT, I think *most* of the sex scenes serve a purpose - and the Littlefinger one was great for his character development.The only gripe I have with this episode is that the Tywin scene should have been at the end. It was the highest point of the episode and sadly the rest of it didn't live up to it - it was an amazing episode, but the scene with Tywin and Jaime is my favorite scene in the series so far. It was perfect. I'm starting to worry what they're going to do with NCW in the second season - Jaime is a prisoner for most of CoK and I think his presence will be very missed.
743	Kaitscralt	2011-05-25	I'm starting to worry what they're going to do with NCW in the second season - Jaime is a prisoner for most of CoK and I think his presence will be very missed.They'll still show him. Jaime was even more absent in the first book than the second, and most of the made up scenes for season one have featured NCW.

I can't remember, but I think there is even a quote from him at one point about having certain types for certain jobs.Great episode, I think I enjoyed Ep 6 slightly more, but this was still exceptionally good.Oh, and I will go to war with Khal Drogo.  I agree with the comment that his speech was not anyone, but to the stars and heavens.   Going to vry disappointing when we (hopefully) see Dany snuff him.
745	LÂ<U+0092>Age dÂ<U+0092>or	2011-05-25	I don't mind the sex scenes but I was deeply disturbed by Viserys' crowning and even the knife through the eye of Jory.You know, sometimes I feel the world would be better if more people thought like me.Dude how did you manage to finish the books?

It wasn't nearly as bad as littlefinger explaining his psychology to some random whores he just picked up, mind you.I quite liked the skinning and cleaning the stag scene. It gave the scene a profound intensity that could never be achieved with him looking at a map or writing a letter. Tywin might not be your regular hunter like Robert, but I could def see him going hunting casually while camping with his Army and subsequently preparing it for cooking. If you ask me its an act of sublimation to release the tension brought by his son's stupidity and Cat's kidnapping of Tyrion.
747	Frumpus	2011-05-25	Dude how did you manage to finish the books?Maybe he didn't read them? I found Viserys' death disturbing in the books largely because I didn't expect it and I also thought it was a sad and pathetic way for him to die, but watching it on the tv show I didn't flinch at all (mostly because I was expecting it).I probably would have been bothered by the death on the tv show if I had not read the books.

Another excellently written scene that was not in the books - these seem to be my favorites!I really like this post. Everyone noble in the realm hunts for sport. There isn't tv or movies or the gym or, god forbid, Westeros message boards. If Tywin was the kind of person that spent all of his time locked behind doors pouring over charts and maps, he would fall out of shape pretty fast. He may not be a great warrior, but he still needs to be able to ride a horse, use his bow, be comfortable stalking prey, etc. The skinning of the stag is probably another way for him to keep in shape, plus I can't imagine too many nobles skinning their own kill. But Tywin can do it while discussing strategy with his son, and not miss a beat. TV viewers should be thinking something along the lines of "this dude is pretty bad ass". Last thing I will say about the LF scene: If it had to be in, why couldn't it have been in next episode or anytime after his betrayal of Ned. It just gives away too much. I honestly feel that HBO thinks all the viewers need to be spoon fed or they won't get it, but everyone I know knew he was going to betray Ned after that scene, thus gone is the surprise. I really hope they don't make a habit of this. I want viewers to be as surprised by certain events as I was when reading the book. Especially Ned's fate. If they ruin that one, I will be pissed.
749	elmis	2011-05-25	I don't see the point of the Roz character at all. If someone can enlighten me about that, I'd be thankful. As someone said, she's basically just stealing screen time. I don't need porn in my stories and I don't need stories in my porn.
Other than that, I thought it was kinda corny to have a "little bird" in Vaes Dothrak. If he has birds there, why does he even need Jorah? Makes no sense to me, better to have him get a letter from a merchant or something (which he then reads and figures out she's in trouble). Though that's a minor nitpick. 
With regards to the slight(?) change of of Sam's character, I find that I enjoy the show Sam a lot more than the book Sam. In my opinion GRRM has overdone the characters cowardice to the point where he's almost a caricature of himself. Another point I don't like about the book-Sam is that he's got the "Hurley-syndrome" of not getting thinner regardless of his harsh circumstances (the show version will probably have that as well, though his weight outset is more within reason). On the trek to the Fist of the First men he had troubles bucking a belt over his belly, and that's like months (maybe a year?) after arriving at the Wall.

751	Gytha Ogg	2011-05-25	I don't need porn in my stories and I don't need stories in my porn.Haha, that's exactly what I said after seeing it.I think why that scene felt jarring is that over the 6 previous episodes the show kind of established its level of sex/nudity. Some had more, some had less, but it was all of the same level - fair amount of some boobs and ass, couple of full frontal shots now and again and sex scenes that didn't drag on. So when that scene kept going and going it just felt off and a bit silly. The nudity or sex itself didn't bother me, just the bloody length. Loved LFs speech though.

752	Papa Manderly's Meat Pie	2011-05-25	Count me in the camp that loved Tywin-Jaime scene. That was a powerful way to introduce his character.For those claiming that Tywin wouldn't "bloody his own hands" I think you are projecting your own ideas of getting your hands dirty on Tywin.  Maybe Tywin likes skinning his kills, finds it a source of stress relief and mind-clearing.Also, and this will probably be more appealing to the people who don't like the skinning, maybe Tywin was doing that to send a message to Jaime.  Maybe he thought, "If Jaime comes in to talk to me, and I'm skinning a stag, and the whole time I'm doing it I'm teaching him a lesson about ruling, it will really drive home my point."  That would totally be in line with book Tywin, who would be 100% OK with manipulating his own children.I really loved the, "Are you going to say something clever?" line as well.  Just all around an excellent scene and a shining example of a good added scene.
753	Tywin's bastard	2011-05-25	Last thing I will say about the LF scene: If it had to be in, why couldn't it have been in next episode or anytime after his betrayal of Ned. It just gives away too much. I honestly feel that HBO thinks all the viewers need to be spoon fed or they won't get it, but everyone I know knew he was going to betray Ned after that scene, thus gone is the surprise. I really hope they don't make a habit of this. I want viewers to be as surprised by certain events as I was when reading the book. Especially Ned's fate. If they ruin that one, I will be pissed.It could have been well placed after the betrayal but they do put his ambitions in a special context in his scene with Ned at the tower of the hand. Littlefinger gives a clear impression that he wants Eddard to claim the power so Petyr can extend his own power by clinging on to, and in part controlling, Ned. Eddard refusing to do what he wants is as bit of a set up for a betrayal as the whorehouse scene.I don't see the point of the Roz character at all. If someone can enlighten me about that, I'd be thankful. As someone said, she's basically just stealing screen time. I don't need porn in my stories and I don't need stories in my porn.As of yet she's been used to set the tone and to deliver a lot of character information but what none of us know yet is her part in King's Landing. The speculations is of course that they will have her replace some other whore so it will be a more familiar, and thus recognizable, face.Other than that, I thought it was kinda corny to have a "little bird" in Vaes Dothrak. If he has birds there, why does he even need Jorah? Makes no sense to me, better to have him get a letter from a merchant or something (which he then reads and figures out she's in trouble). Though that's a minor nitpick.I don't know how one of the little birds could replace Jorah. We don't exactly see a lot of orphans hanging around Dany and there aren't any secret passages for them to spy from either.
754	Maia	2011-05-25	I have only seen the preview, but the art of hunting _and_ dressing the kill was a substantial part of education of every medieval nobleman. Hunting was also quite important for image - it showed that the nobleman was fit and warlike. 
And Tywin always did everything that he considered important for his image and that of House Lannister, whether he enjoyed it or not. Like dancing at the feasts, dressing flamboyantly, etc. So, why not hunting? He must have done something to stay so phenomenally in shape anyway. What I personally find incongruous is that he seems to be dressing the kill in his tent (!). I am no expert, but it seems implausible to me.
755	Impish	2011-05-25	I just don't see Tywin going off to hunt. Or really do much of anything 'fun'.What about him sleeping with Shae?  Doesn't this establish he isn't just some robot, he has desires and wants outside of his duties?I guess all I'm saying is, I don't see this as taking away from or changing Tywin's character, I just see it as adding another dimension to him.If it happened in a study with him over a book it wouldn't have nearly the same impact.Agreed.  I also think it will give Tywin more of an "arc".. we are going to see plenty of him planning and commanding, we now have something to contrast that with, before he goes into full-on campaign mode.GRRM didn't "show" the king getting gored, nor his death in the books.Exactly... seems like they're damned if they do, damned if they don't.  Because you just know that if they DID show Robert getting gored, there would be OTHER fans screaming bloody murder, that they should've followed the book, that it has more impact if we find out the same way Ned does, etc etc.well surprise, surprise, people actually aren't so juvenile to be happy about character development being shortchanged for sexscenes.Yeah it develops him about three seasons in advanceWait, I thought the character development was being shortchanged?  Now it's just too early? You should really make up your mind about what you're insulting people over.The scene was brilliant (even moreso on rewatch) because LF's whole "sex advice" talk ("let them think they're winning you over", etc) was really about him.  If you can't appreciate that because of the "adult content", fine, but that doesn't make the rest of us "juvenile".
756	montana	2011-05-25	I can't get on to HBO GO.  Anyone else having trouble?You bet... having great trouble tried several times... no go... just have to wait... dang!
757	Kalbear	2011-05-25	What about him sleeping with Shae? Doesn't this establish he isn't just some robot, he has desires and wants outside of his duties?I guess all I'm saying is, I don't see this as taking away from or changing Tywin's character, I just see it as adding another dimension to him.The key word there is 'off'. I also don't see him fucking whores while on campaign. Perhaps I'm wrong.It's not a big deal, but it did strike me as more than a bit strange. His dialog was great though; 'say something clever' made me think he was going to go all Pulp Fiction on Jaime's ass. And hell, more time with Tywin isn't bad at all.
758	The Badger of Winterfell	2011-05-25	I thought it was a fantastic episode. The scenes that seem to be most contentious were the added LF and Tywin scenes. I personally loved the Tywin scene, I can see where people are coming from when they say Tywin isn't the type to get his hands dirty, but dressing a kill is not the same as say, personally executing someone. I still think the show Tywin will be mainly about plotting behind the scenes, but i think it was a fun addition to the scene that enhanced not detracted from his character. Also, saw Charles Dance literally days earlier as Lord Vetinari from Terry Pratchett's discworld, and he was just as amazing as i thought he was going to be.
Less sure about the LF scene. Unlike some people didnt especially mind the actually nudity bits, I can actually imagine Littlefinger as someone who micromanages his whores. It was the whole exposition part of his monologue i didnt like; one, it seemed out of character for LF to share so much information for no practical gain, and two, it did kind of spoil the surprise about hiis betrayal. It seemed to me they'd purposefully underplayed LF's untrustworthiness in previous episodes so that his betrayal would be more unexpected, then they slapped in this scene where it basically reveals LF hates Ned.
Overall though, absolutely fantastic, especially the "I did warn you not trust me," line, one of the moments i'd been waiting for with bated breath and Aiden Gillan didn't disappoint.

Excellent point.  Amazingly, some people completely miss this whole angle.
760	cklabyrinth	2011-05-25	About Tywin butchering the stag...First time he appears in the book he tells Tyrion:The Stark boy is a child. No doubt he likes the sound of warhorns well enough, and the sight of his banners fluttering in the wind, but in the end it comes to butcher's work. I doubt he has the stomach for it.The things you catch on a re-read. Sheds some new light on his first scene in the show, definitely. /wink.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />
761	elmis	2011-05-26	I get that Littlefingers speech was also about himself, that doesn't make the scene good though. I don't mind nudity, or sex, but when one of the characters is about to squirt on another characters face I'm wondering if I'm watching Californication or Game of Thrones. They have an hour each week, let's cut out the non essential stuff (like say, Theon paying to see Roz' poon or rather the entire Roz character) and make each minute count.
Roz is the Jar Jar Binks of Game of Thrones.

I kind of agree. It DID work for me, but it could have been done even better... My dream scenario:They start saying the words. The camera zooms in on one of the older brothers. His voice is added to Jon and Sams. We go into his head, and we see an even larger group saying the words. Many voices are added speaking the words. We go back another XX years, we see the Wall protected by thousands and thousands of men of the nights watch. As they come to the last few words we return to Sam and Jon, and that petty little group of men standing around the tree... There are almost nobody left protecting the wall. And here comes Ghost with a frozen hand...
765	The Anti-Targ	2011-05-26	Now this was finally the Epic episode I've been waiting for AWESOMENESS to the max! 
I don't know who I wanted to strangle more: Ned for being such a fool to think he could trust Littlefinger after he rejected LF's plan, or LF for shitting on Ned.
Damn but people who don't know the book are going to be gagging after watching this.
I hope we get to see a scene between Cersei and Sansa next week where Cersei thanks Sansa for bringing her Ned's plan to get the girls out of KL. 
I wanted to resist and wait until Monday (my time) but I couldn't do it. I'll watch it again Monday anyway.
Edit: And that shit in the whorehouse with Ros was just pornographic. No subtlety whatsoever. I didn't think GoT would out sex Spartacus, but I think it just took the lead.

766	jlk7e	2011-05-26	I've never really been clear on how Sansa's "betrayal" is supposed to have actually helped Cersei.  Littlefinger knew way more about Ned's plans than Sansa did, and he had just hired the City Watch to side with Cersei.  What information exactly did Sansa provide that Littlefinger didn't already have?
767	paddydubh	2011-05-26	I don't see the point of the Roz character at all. If someone can enlighten me about that, I'd be thankful. As someone said, she's basically just stealing screen time.

Though that's a minor nitpick. With regards to the slight(?) change of of Sam's character, I find that I enjoy the show Sam a lot more than the book Sam. In my opinion GRRM has overdone the characters cowardice to the point where he's almost a caricature of himself. Another point I don't like about the book-Sam is that he's got the "Hurley-syndrome" of not getting thinner regardless of his harsh circumstances (the show version will probably have that as well, though his weight outset is more within reason). On the trek to the Fist of the First men he had troubles bucking a belt over his belly, and that's like months (maybe a year?) after arriving at the Wall.I can see why she's being used to expand on characters such as Theon and LF. I was also thinking maybe she could be the whore who helps Tyrion get to Shae (rather than introfucing allaya). Therefore cutting down on future plottime as well as having a familiar face for characterisation.

769	Mad Sweeney	2011-05-26	GRRM didn't "show" the king getting gored, nor his death in the books.  Why would you people (obviously more than just you, many others have stated the desire for more scenes of Robert when they weren't in the book) want stuff that's not in the book, that characters in the show find out when we find out, that are unnecessary in that regard, over well structured double and triple entendre, mood setting scenes with tittilating eye candy as a bonus?  What would showing Robert get gored add to the show?  No one in the books really saw it (POV characters at least) so that exposition is exactly the same as in the books and adds intrigue later on when the discussion of how the King died reaches conspiracy level.  There's obviously a reason they're showing Ros so much.  You're going to have to get used to the idea that with all the character combinings and eliminations that are necessary to transfer this to TV, that she has a bigger role to play.  I highly doubt they have her in the show so much for no reason whatsoever.  You all, for the most part, seem to be largely happy with the show, so show a little faith int he guys that are entertaining you so much that there's a reason for Ros' repeat appearances.  For crying out loud, I never in my 39 years thought I'd ever hear even so much as an eighth so much bitching from fantasy book geeks about TOO MANY BOOBIES being shown on a great adaptation of an all time great fantasy series!Edited...the below is my comment, I think I messed up somehow and the original post is not "blocked"...sorry OP, don't know how to detach what I did. All I can think about during the gratuitous sex scenes is "Is this going to cost HBO viewers?" I want the show renewed again and again. I don't mind the sex, just not so much of it.I don't see how showing boobies is going to cost HBO viewers.  That's what they do and they have a long line of successful shows based around sex to show for it.  If anything it will attract more viewers when word gets out that it's a character based, adult themed show and not a teen boy's geeky fantasy series.
770	Mad Sweeney	2011-05-26	well surprise, surprise, people actually aren't so juvenile to be happy about character development being shortchanged for sexscenes.Surprise, surprise, that was thus far the BEST and most layered character development of the show so your argument falls on deaf ears.
771	Borias	2011-05-26	I get that Littlefingers speech was also about himself, that doesn't make the scene good though.

They have an hour each week, let's cut out the non essential stuff (like say, Theon paying to see Roz' poon or rather the entire Roz character) and make each minute count.Roz is the Jar Jar Binks of Game of Thrones.That's a bit too much.  Roz has been indirectly responsible for us as the viewers to learn a good bit of information we wouldn't normally.  If not for her, we would have a woefully small amount of development from Theon, or even backstory.  Now it makes much more sense why he does what he does in aCoK.  She's directly responsible for such a great introduction to Tyrion, and apparently well known in the north in her trade- which gives her the means to go south.And since she's there, as other's have said, she might take over another characters role.  And the scene with LF?  It shows us that now and then, he does get directly involved with overseeing his investments, and gives us some of his backstory.  Granted, it was done in a strange way, but it needed to be done.  Who else was he going to tell?Jar Jar had a horrible voice(borderline racist), was completely incompetent, needed rescuing more than Bella and Mary Jane Watson combined, and was designed to make the series more kid friendly.  Oh, and he was the legal linchpin for the empire to take final control.  They don't really compare well to each other.
772	Manderly`s Personal Chef	2011-05-26	Why are there only 5 of the Kingsguard? And Tywin LAUGHS! Otherwise the best episode thus far.

Oh, and he was the legal linchpin for the empire to take final control.  They don't really compare well to each other.I'm not suggesting that we cut Roz and leave blank space, the time would be filled up giving the viewer the same information, just without a busty naked woman there at every turn (I can't even believe I'm typing this, I love busty naked women). Why couldn't we learn a bit more about Theon when Maester Luwin was teaching Bran about the different Houses? I mean, it's not like he's not standing there, shooting arrows. That would be character development for three major characters, rather than just one and some flopping tits.For what it's worth, I didn't think the introduction to Tyrion was all that great.. I'd imagine that getting more whores from your brother would be somewhat of a turn off for Tyrion, when you think about their history with Tysha. The scene with Littlefinger was not good in my opinion (it was smartly done -- but not good), not just because of the gratuitous sex, but also because it didn't feel like something Littlefinger would do. It's like the writers thought; "We need a sex scene, but we also need to have Littlefinger hint at his future actions -- how to best do that?" rather than, "We need to have Littlefinger hint at his future actions -- how to best do that?". Lastly, the analogy I made towards Jar Jar was that he was George Lucas' clown, the character to draw in the kids. Roz is a played by a beautiful young naked actress, she's there to draw in the 18-49 male demo's that HBO want.

Gratuitous lesbian sex makes it more "teen boy's fantasy." And throwing in random sex scenes does not make this "character based." I, for the most part, enjoy sex/nudity in my movies/shows. That scene just made me cringe though.

Oh yeah, GRRM is an executive producer on it so I guess you should direct your anger at him for his gratuitous sex scene in his TV show!  /lmao.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lmao:' />This is worse than the argument that gold shouldn't melt in a cookpot, even though GRRM wrote that gold melted in a cookpot!BTW, fantasy as in swords and elves, not sexual fantasies.  They will get more viewers by distancing themselves more from the former than from the latter.  That was the comment I was responding to about this issue; that HBO will "lose viewers" because of scenes like this.

779	Arrogant Bastard	2011-05-26	Yeah I'm not a prude by any means but I thought that scene was a bit much.

It wasn't subtle at all, but I don't think it was supposed to be. I thought his monologue got across his motivations well, something that isn't really established in the books but I think for TV it's important to know what makes him tick. Also, I've never found LF to be a very subtle character. He was always openly distrustful, constantly mocking Ned and everyone to their face. So I don't think it was that out of character for him to tell the whores his motivations and backstory. He openly tells Ned not to trust him, [SPOILERS FOR BOOK 2 and 3] blatantly shows Tyrion the knife he lied about that caused Tyrion's capture, and kisses Sansa in a spot where his wife could see. So to me, LF does all this because he knows how smart he is and he can get away with all of it, which he does. So I'm sure he knows that telling the whores his backstory will have no repercussions for him at all.
780	modehead	2011-05-26	Surprise, surprise, that was thus far the BEST and most layered character development of the show so your argument falls on deaf ears.This is your opinion. What did it add to Littlefingers character? That he's a scheming pimp with twisted feelings for cat? We all know that already.
781	modehead	2011-05-26	Not really. Tissue?Some people realy disliked it (I'm one of them.) We're entitled to our opinion.If it was a great episode (like 5 and 6), it wouldn't have this many people complaining about it.  Wait till the AV Club gives it a C or worse and other weekly reviewers butcher it.  That was horrible TV
782	Wunhopkuendo	2011-05-26	I have finally come to terms with the LF scene I hate so much. So here is how I have reconciled it in my head: LF knows that Varys has spies everywhere. So he is less than subtle about his intentions to take down Ned so that if Varys is in any way inclined to inform Ned, LF will certainly know, as Ned would confront him on it almost instantly. Ned isn't one that would keep that information in his pocket for later use, and LF knows this. To which, LF also knows he could easily talk his way out of it and shift the blame back to Varys. So LF needs to know if Varys will indeed sell him out before he can set his betrayal plan into motion. In that regard, the scene makes perfect sense. Yeah. That's my story and I am sticking to it. Now to re-watch the scene a few more times just to make sure that is what is going on and not at all to see two hot chicks going at it.
783	modehead	2011-05-26	Sex and violence help ratings. Then why in gods name don't you show the drunk king get gored by a wild boar?  Imagine watching Star Wars, and instead of seeing Obi Wan die, you find out over the intercom.  It's bad film making. There's no literary device keeping this TV show from showing Robert die, so there's no excuse.This series is confusing for new people. Make it simpler:SHOW thing king dying, DONT TELL us the king died.SHOW Littlefinger scheming, DONT TELL us through an absurdly long monologue that is cluttered by the "play with her ass" crap.  Remember how in that episode we SEE Ned find out how Joffery is not a Baratheon? We actually SEE Sansa clue him in, then see him look at the actual words. We DONT have someone TELL us that Jofferey is not the rightful heir. We see it.Then, in the next scene, we SEE Joffery on the throne.
784	modehead	2011-05-26	I strongly disagree with you- in any medium, finding out suddenly from Ned's PoV what happened to robert rather than seeing it creates far more suspense, surprise and emotion for me. If they'd shown him being gored I would have hated it.Lots of people think Ned's actions are ridiculous in the books. I don't think theyve changed that. On TVWP, so far people have gotten that Ned was silly but was doing it because he was honourable. I think the scenes do highlight Ned's choices as foolish but I'm fairly sure that's diberatd and consistent with the source. If you don't like it, your problem is with Ned, not the writers.Fair enough, but this is worth a debate:Finding out about Robert third hand can't create suspense. It's the antithesis of suspense. Does it add intensity to Ned's feeling of impending doom. Definitely. Here's my opinion on the subject: in this TV series, we get to know Robert (almost intimately). Between the scene where he's drunk and can't get dressed, and the 1-on-1 with Cersei, he feels like a major player. For him to die off screen just doesn't seem to add suspense for me.And yes, I have problems with Ned. His actions, spaced out over 10 weeks make him look like an idiot, which is a shame. You've seen the "Stupid Ned Stark" meme going around, right? I'm not alone in my opinion on the character.
785	Mad Sweeney	2011-05-26	This is your opinion. What did it add to Littlefingers character? That he's a scheming pimp with twisted feelings for cat? We all know that already.Well, it highlighted his "short man's complex" with the description of his ways versus the ways of the "stronger" men he has to fight with for his ambitious goals.  It also showed that he is perfectly capable of ignoring the goods in front of him to achieve his very particular goals.  He's not interested in the two women right in front of him, he's barely even looking at them as sexual objects (as they relate to him).  They're tools that he's training, just like all the other people that he uses.  And since they're just tools (like all the other tools he uses), once they have no value to him they can be discarded, just as Ned is.  Maybe that's a little hindsight as a revelation since I've already seen the depths he goes to, but the impersonal way he treated the girls and his complete disinterest in them as people can quite easily be seen from that.  I have to watch it again on the big TV after this weekend to get more, but it's not "opinion" that the scene added no character development to LF, it's just plain wrong.
786	aimlessgun	2011-05-26	While I take all of your points Mad Sweeney, a lot of my discomfort with the scene is how it comes across to the non-readers I know. They don't see all the character development. They see lolHBO smut quota being filled and roll their eyes. If the scene has all that stuff, but doesn't communicate it, it is useless and a failure. 
And of course for readers, there's the serious issue that LF frankly wouldn't be teaching whores their trade and telling them his plans.
787	Impish	2011-05-26	If it was a great episode (like 5 and 6), it wouldn't have this many people complaining about it.Even ignoring the problems with argumentum ad populum, are you really suggesting there were significantly less complaints about episodes 5 and 6?Loras was too skinny and not attractive enough, Renly wasn't kingly enough, their scene was unneeded or too obvious or too explicit (slurping sounds, etc), the Theon/Roz scene was awful, Lysa wasn't fat like the books, Vardis wasn't old enough, the Robert/Cersei scene was terrible and totally out-of-character, the Varys/LF scene was terrible and totally out-of-character, the Ned/Jaime fight was way too even, the swordfighting was all terrible, the Eyrie looked unrealistic and we didn't get to see the ascent... on and on and on and on.That's just from skimming the first couple pages of the Ep5 thread.The only real complaints about Ep7 seem largely to do with the LF scene, and nitpicking over Tywin's introduction.  And you're convinced we needed to see Robert getting gored, but clearly GRRM and the show's writers felt differently, and trusted in how things unfolded the book.  I would tend to agree, and think the show is in very good hands.  But that's just my opinion of course.
788	Tywin's bastard	2011-05-26	Some people realy disliked it (I'm one of them.) We're entitled to our opinion.If it was a great episode (like 5 and 6), it wouldn't have this many people complaining about it.  Wait till the AV Club gives it a C or worse and other weekly reviewers butcher it.  That was horrible TVEveryone are entitled to their opinions but both of you are stating opinions as facts. Not much constructive debate will come out of that.I don't see much point in trying to point towards other things to try to validate your opinion either, especially since it doesn't really fit. Episode 5 had as much criticism as this one had (haven't read that much on episode 6 as I moved to this forum part instead) and why would anyone give a C to something that's "horrible"? C is a passing grade while horrible is about as bad as you can possibly make something.Our opinions about art aren't more or less valid depending on how many others that think the same way.

Wait till the AV Club gives it a C or worse and other weekly reviewers butcher it.  That was horrible TVI thought it was a great episode, and I don't care one iota about the people complaining about it or what grade the AV Club gives it. I can form my own opinion, just because you and others didn't like it doesn't mean it was horrible TV. And I have a feeling most reviewers are going to like this episode more than the last two; either way, it doesn't change what I thought of it.
790	End of Disc One	2011-05-26	It seems like overall this is the best received episode yet.  Modehead is almost alone in his opinion.
791	Morrigan	2011-05-26	It continues to amuse me that sex and nudity are "juvenile" or "immature" and yet beheadings and knives through the eye are just so awesome... /rolleyes2.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':rolleyes:' />I don't mind the sex scenes but I was deeply disturbed by Viserys' crowning and even the knife through the eye of Jory.You know, sometimes I feel the world would be better if more people thought like me.Maybe because, you know, these beheadings and melted gold crowning are, I don't know... plot-relevant? /rolleyes2.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':rolleyes:' />
792	tybeechris	2011-05-26	I think we will get even more complaints of excessive nudity with the LF/Roz/new girl scene. As the scene started, I was thinking the same but as it progressed I felt it worked because we got to see LF's naked ambition. pun intended.I felt that scene heavily foreshadowed that LF would betray Ned, that he would pick his ambition over doing "the right thing".I peeked over at TWP and no one there is even mentioning all the sex. It seems to flow right along with the plot for them. For us it seems we want every minute to give us each some more info so we are trying to steal that time from the sex. As long as it does not turn them off and we have two rousing seasons I will be happy. Maybe George will get book 6 done so there will be a continuity to the TV seres. I can dream.
793	Tywin's bastard	2011-05-27	Maybe because, you know, these beheadings and melted gold crowning are, I don't know... plot-relevant? /rolleyes2.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':rolleyes:' />I don't think you understood what they meant. Just as you can shoot sex scenes that don't reveal much you can also shoot death/battle scenes without any gore. The sex and the violence is about on the same relative levels in this show and the relevance to the plot doesn't differ either since the sex scenes have this far told more than the action scenes.Note that I'm not complaining about neither the sex nor the violence, I just put it in perspective since people are right in that there's a significant double standard regarding sex and violence.
794	Greywolf2375	2011-05-27	LF's double entendre monologue was the character based part of it, not the boobs.  If you guys would get that straight (that the scene was about LF, not the sex), then you wouldn't have to be so hung up about it.  Oh yeah, GRRM is an executive producer on it so I guess you should direct your anger at him for his gratuitous sex scene in his TV show!  /lmao.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lmao:' />This is worse than the argument that gold shouldn't melt in a cookpot, even though GRRM wrote that gold melted in a cookpot!We got it, thanks, it was as subtle as Jaime's dagger through Jory's eye.But please, explain then how "play with her ass" and showing one whore diddle another's ass put the Littlefinger character arc forward?  Is that some subtle reference to how LF was going to fuck over Ned?
795	Rockroi	2011-05-27	But please, explain then how "play with her ass" and showing one whore diddle another's ass put the Littlefinger character arc forward? Is that some subtle reference to how LF was going to fuck over Ned?Okay, look, I'm one of the people who actually liked the scene in terms of Littlefinger's ambitions superimposed on a sexual act.  Yes, I fully admit that the sexual act itself was far too gratuitous and even a little silly.  I am committed to that part of the discussion. Yes, "Play with her ass" was about as subtle as the sucking noises coming off Renly's cock in the prior episode.  At the same time, the overall message of that scene encompasses how LF can go- effortlessly -from being perceived (correctly) as a self-possessed schemer who wants only what is best for himself and somehow transform himself (in the eyes of his "partner") into somebody who is seen (incorrectly) as having scruples and morals and will do what is best for others.  The whole point of the scene- once we look beyond the flapping boobs and the moans -is that Littlefinger creeps not onto you physically but into you mentally.  As he states, he knows that he is "...not fooling them â<U+0080>¦" and that "they know what he isâ<U+0080>¦"  They know what LF is, and its his job- much like the whore's job, "to make them forget what they knowâ<U+0080>¦ that takes timeâ<U+0080>¦"  By the time its all over, the customer thinks he;s actually really GOOD at this; that he has the ability- has always had the ability -to win the slut over.  The slut- the Littlefinger - cannot POSSIBLY stand in the way of a man who is just so ... GOOD!   After all, Ned "knows heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s better than other men..."  Are we really to believe that Ned Stark did not think this? That Ned Stark had not forgotten what LF was?  And that LF had not MADE him forget?  That's exactly what happened to Ned Stark.  He forgot that this was a game; he was outsmarted by a slut; that the whore never changes his spots; he's always in it for himself, that its all just moans and groans and flapping gums.  Its all just smoke, mirrors and cheap tricks to separate the man from his senses.  As Harry Anderson used to say "Never eat at a place called 'Mom's; never play cards with a guy named 'Pops'; and a fool and his money were lucky to get together in the first place."  â<U+0080><U+009C>because what we donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know usually is what gets us killedâ<U+0080><U+009D>And Ned got fucked.  But what do I know; I still think the Drogo seen is laughably bad.

796	Patrick Tully	2011-05-27	I've never really been clear on how Sansa's "betrayal" is supposed to have actually helped Cersei.  Littlefinger knew way more about Ned's plans than Sansa did, and he had just hired the City Watch to side with Cersei.  What information exactly did Sansa provide that Littlefinger didn't already have?That is a point a lot of people seem to miss in the books. However, there is a part there Sansa's info was probably significant - the placing fake Stark guards on the boat to capture Arya. Had Arya not seen through the ruse, that would have been more important.

797	FlipFantastic	2011-05-27	Man, Drogo's speech gave me chills and makes me wish he doesnt actually die. Now, I think having the Dothroki invade would have been much cooler than killing him off and having Dany wander around the free cities forever recruiting an army ball'less warriors.  You blew it GRRM!  The Dothroki and Drogo are kickASS,  I dont expect the show to deviate from that plot line, though.

I can't even think of any mainstream movies where such an awkward and filthy sex scene occurs.
799	Kalbear	2011-05-27	Rock, I absolutely understand the subtext. 
The problem for me was that having that at the beginning of the episode robbed Littlefinger's dramatic betrayal. He just told us he's going to fuck over Ned - and then he goes and fucks over Ned. SHOCKING.
I didn't think the exposition was necessary; did we need to see Littlefinger's motivations for this right now? Couldn't we have seen this next ep or something? I also thought Littlefinger coaching random whores to be...well, really beneath him. I mean...Al Swearengen owns a brothel, but could you imagine him actually telling the whores how to fuck? The exposition was okay if not a bit too early, but the actual framing of the exposition was fairly stupid.

The exposition was okay if not a bit too early, but the actual framing of the exposition was fairly stupid.The way I took it was just as Rockroi said, but also playing to the viewer as well. The non-book reader thinking, I can see that this guy is sleazy but he won't do that, will he? So the viewer is lulled a bit when we see him bargaining with Ned because it came across as "yes I'm a bastard but you won me this time", so when the viewer "gets fucked" with the capture of Ned, they saw it coming but hoped it wasn't the case. Or maybe I'm just talking outta my ass. While it's being fingered, of course.  /lmao.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lmao:' />
801	oneeye	2011-05-27	It would be too easy with Drogo staying alive, it's all about Dany leveling up and kicking butt
I don't even remember Roz from the books but I like her now ;p

804	AshaÂ<U+0097>Not Yara!	2011-05-27	Yeah it was a bit uncomfortable! I had no idea the opening scene was going to be like that.

Is that some subtle reference to how LF was going to fuck over Ned?I've already answered that a few times.  And it's not a reference, but coupled with his attempt to show Ned how to resolve the transition peacefully, it's certainly an indicator that it was possible. Psssst, that's called character developmen!
806	Mad Sweeney	2011-05-27	I know it's your opinion, but you're just like...wrong man. The Drogo seen was actually better than the book portrayed it - and the LF scene was too much to the point of being ridiculous.

You're watching an HBO original series where they have stuff like that all the time.
807	Alcarin	2011-05-27	Basically what Rockroi said sums up that Brothel scene 99%
I think it was awesome, the only problem i had is that i had to rewatch it twice to actually get all the story......
Just lost the story at some point watching the ladies... Damn it /tongue.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
808	Rex	2011-05-27	Well, the way I see it, there were two reasons for the sex during LF's little exposition.
1) Yes, using the sex that was happening as a metaphor with what he was planning to do to Ned. This part pandered to the readers, who obviously already knew what was going to happen. It's sly, it's clever and it's very Littlefinger.
2) It's a distraction. Yes; I watched this with three friends and all were shocked when LF betrayed Ned. It's hard for a viewer who doesn't know the books (and even ones who do) to get distracted by what their eyes see and so not pay as much attention to what their ears pick up. In essence it's the show trying to be (and in at least three instances) succeeding to be very clever. They dangle info in front of the viewers eyes and still manage to let them not notice it.

Damn it /tongue.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />Right, so the sex detracted from the drama, story and character development rather than enhanced or supported it.People keep saying there's a double standard here with the sex and violence as if there's way more and gratuitous violence than there is sex. I think if anything it's the opposite, Screen time wise I don't think we've had 5 solid minutes of neck slicing, gut opening, limb loping, arterial spurting gratuity. I betcha if we did see that people would be all over the blood and gore as being way too much, potentially off putting and a waste of precious screen time. And having someone launch into a monologue about their personal ambitions while there was death and gore going on would be cheesy in the extreme. Yet it's not cheesy when LF does it while a couple of whores in training are refining their craft with each other?If there is a double standard seems its biased in favour of the sex.Ros and friend was more than I was expecting, and more than I wanted, from the sex and nudity element of this series.
810	smidget25	2011-05-27	I watched most of this episode through my fingers tbh. I knew it was coming, and yet I was still practically screaming at my screen, 'Ned, WTF are you going?!' It was actually painful to watch Cersei warn him about her 'wrath', Renly warn him about Cersei, and even LF warn him about Cersei, only for him to do nothing. Why he thought trusting LF was a good idea remains a mystery, just like it was in the book. 
It was a brilliant episode, and an excellent piece of TV, but I just felt so bad for poor Ned. He was well and truly outclassed by both Cersei and LF. 
And in regards to LF's long exposition/sex scene, it did seem a bit unnecessary, but it definitely shed some light on LF's motivations (which I don't think I would have got if I hadn't read the books) and generally painted him as a bit of a creeper. I feel it went on too long though.
811	Rockroi	2011-05-27	The problem for me was that having that at the beginning of the episode robbed Littlefinger's dramatic betrayal. He just told us he's going to fuck over Ned - and then he goes and fucks over Ned. SHOCKING.Yeah, there is only so much one can take from the first half of the scene and be able to justify it before you see the second half of the scene.  All I can say here is that Littlefinger's motivations and dramatic twist is obvious to all of us: we've read the book.  But is it just as obvious to the non-reader?  I am not so sure.  But this does crystalize one of my issues with these allusions (Tywin and the Stag being another example): they seem as if non-readers won't understand them and readers will think them too heavy-handed.  I didn't think the exposition was necessary; did we need to see Littlefinger's motivations for this right now? Couldn't we have seen this next ep or something?I think if they had to put it anywhere it would have to be before; that way when people re-viewed it (who had not read the books) they maybe able to see how clever it was.  Afterwards it would be more lost.
812	Mad Sweeney	2011-05-27	Well, the way I see it, there were two reasons for the sex during LF's little exposition.1) Yes, using the sex that was happening as a metaphor with what he was planning to do to Ned.

They dangle info in front of the viewers eyes and still manage to let them not notice it.My only nitpick with the above is that LF is planning on doing it to everyone, not just Ned!
813	malarky1231	2011-05-28	I didn't mind the sex scene at all. I mean c'mon it's HBO, you gotta have all the sex and violence. The two practically go hand in hand. I do agree that Tywin Lannister skinning the deer was heavy-handed yet hard for non-readers to analyze. The scene with LF telling how he is going to get what is rightfully his complements nicely with the two whore's sex scene. All in all I think it was a bit confusing for non-readers to understand and overdone and contrived for readers. They definitely could've left some scenes out, but that would've made things even more confusing. The sex and violence itself is fine, but the purpose of those scenes is questionable.
814	valacirca	2011-05-28	Not reading the other posts in the thread since I'll see this when it comes out on HBO as scheduled... I just wanted to know: Is the Arya chapter included in this episode and is it covered in full here? Starting from the part where she's training with Syrio until she gets to the dungeons with the dragon relics?Logically, it should, but I was thinking that maybe it was pushed back to E08 because of its title "The Pointy End". I really excited to see that chapter adapted to TV in full though.
815	malarky1231	2011-05-28	Do you mean the part where she escapes? Probably in the episode eight. If you're asking for the part where she's chasing cats and follows it into the place where they keep the dragon bones, then that would be Episode five.
816	valacirca	2011-05-28	Yeah I mean the part where she's in her final training session with Syrio, then the Lannister guards come in to take her, Syrio fights them, she escapes and eventually ends up in the dungeons again.
817	reiver	2011-05-28	No that's not in it. We stop just before that.
818	Alcarin	2011-05-28	Right, so the sex detracted from the drama, story and character development rather than enhanced or supported it.People keep saying there's a double standard here with the sex and violence as if there's way more and gratuitous violence than there is sex.

Its not so easy to make such monologue when he talks of sex but actually deep down can be analysed as his political career and his way of working with people...I think 80% of people who will watch on TV did not even get his stuff and those of us who read the book and enjoy LF ''loved'' his monologue.But dont get me wrong i too think it was overdone BUT i can look over it and enjoy LFs awesome portrayal of Aiden Gillen.I was also cringing with 20 sec moving of Dany to hot bath, but fuck it i survived... I actually saw even less meaning there and saw NO meaning in Ros showing Theon before leaving...But LF scene was pretty good.

I'm not talking about LF's exposition - as said above by Kal - tell me how "play with her ass" and showing Roz doing that has any character development.  How is showing that in any way developing a character?
820	King's Landing	2011-05-28	This site love to nitpick over everything.  I say just let it go and enjoy the show all.  It is an adaptation, not a chapter by chapter remake of the novel without anything new or changed.  
I will be interested in seeing how we nitpick episode 8 when it comes out as that is the one that was written by GRRM.
Also, some of the noob forums I visited at other sites on this episode, most of the new people were completely taken by surprise with LF's betrayal at the end.  And they did not say much of anything about the brothel scene.

821	malarky1231	2011-05-28	Roz wasn't even an important character in the books. If I remember it correctly, she never went to King Landing and the only mention of her I remember was when Jon Snow mentioned refusing her service out of fear of conceiving a bastard
822	IheartTesla	2011-05-28	I distinctly heard it as 'play with her arse'.Overall, a good episode. Tywin was great, although that conversation never happened I think we get how everyone kind of shrinks before the patriarch. I did roll my eyes a bit at the 'be all that you can be' shtick, and was suitably disturbed by his Third Reich '1000 year' pep talk. I understand also why they put in the sexposition scene (to explain/foreshadow Littlefinger's betrayal of Ned), although it was a bit anvilicous.Was a bit concerned about the Ros timeline, but I think it barely works. You'd have to read the books to figure out Ned was in a 6 day coma. That should give enough time for her turnip cart to get to KL from Winterfell and her to fill out her paperwork for a permanent work permit. So the timeline I believe is - Jamie kills Jory, raven gets to Theon and Robb, Ros flashes Theon, hoofs it to KL all in time for Ned to wake up.The Dothraki and Wall scenes were enjoyable too, and the final cliffhanger betrayal of Ned I thought was extremely well done.

823	Abaddon	2011-05-28	Roz wasn't even an important character in the books. If I remember it correctly, she never went to King Landing and the only mention of her I remember was when Jon Snow mentioned refusing her service out of fear of conceiving a bastardRoz wasn't a not important character in the books, she wasn't in the books at all.
824	Mad Sweeney	2011-05-28	This.So a finger in someone's ass is now character development?  How?   I'm not talking about LF's exposition - as said above by Kal - tell me how "play with her ass" and showing Roz doing that has any character development.  How is showing that in any way developing a character?I've answered this repeatedly.  The women doing their deed are secondary.  They could've been fisting each other in gimp outfits or simply undressing each other sensually.  LF's words were the character development, not the women's actions.  The juxtaposition of what the women are doing and LF's speech (since it's the same layered secene that's designed as a double entendre, they go together; they are not two separate incidents) in which he ignores their sexuality, guides them in their trade, and uses his guidance as a metaphor for his actions in life, love, ambition and politics is the character development.  Get it through your thick skull so I don't have to answer it again.eta:  I will agree with you on one thing.  If you take out LF's speech, which is the sole point of the entire scene, then there is no character development in that scene.  Of course, if you take out all the speeches in almost all movies, books, TV shows, plays, comics etc ever made then there's no character development either.  That's why characters talk. HTH

825	Knight Of The North	2011-05-28	Just a quick question for those who've seen it; I believe Robb mobilises the North in this Episode. Is it done well? Do they include Greatjon Umber getting a slight maiming? If I've missed it in the 18 odd pages of comments, I apologise. I'm just VERY curious.
826	Abaddon	2011-05-28	You didn't miss it, it hasn't happened yet.
827	malarky1231	2011-05-28	Roz wasn't a not important character in the books, she wasn't in the books at all.Oops. Guess someone here didn't read the books closely enough. /blushing.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':blushing:' />
828	Blackfish Blues	2011-05-29	People keep saying there's a double standard here with the sex and violence as if there's way more and gratuitous violence than there is sex. I think if anything it's the opposite, Screen time wise I don't think we've had 5 solid minutes of neck slicing, gut opening, limb loping, arterial spurting gratuity. I betcha if we did see that people would be all over the blood and gore as being way too much, potentially off putting and a waste of precious screen time. And having someone launch into a monologue about their personal ambitions while there was death and gore going on would be cheesy in the extreme. Yet it's not cheesy when LF does it while a couple of whores in training are refining their craft with each other?If there is a double standard seems its biased in favour of the sex.Ros and friend was more than I was expecting, and more than I wanted, from the sex and nudity element of this series./agree.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':agree:' />In my personal opinion, there HAS to be a double standard between sex and violence, because, simply, it's a dicotomy that exists in our lives. Violence. I think most of us are so lucky as to live in a world where they don't see every day people with knives in their eyes, burned alive with gold, gutted by a spear in the throat. Probably, so I think, we are revolted by such scenes, but we are able to keep a distance from them. In fact, I too was surprised that very few people complained about the violence. Personally it took me aback in the first couple of eps (Hugh's death especially) but then I learned to deal with it with more equanimity. I hated Jory's death, he didn't even make a handsome corpse. But I did not protest, and not because I'm inured to violence or somehow aroused by it; simply because it pushed no buttons in me, except for natural revulsion, grief and compassion. I think most of us agree that violence is bad.Sex. I also assume that most of us, instead, deal with sex more or less daily, whether it's thoughts or actions. And I suppose that each of us approaches sex in a different way... actually, that's the fun of it! But some, maybe many, have issues with it. There need to be no shame or derision attached to it. So it may be likely that our approach to sex scenes is likewise very varied. It has nothing to do with pruderie or moralism. Personally, I'm mad that I don't have that much sex as they have on the show. /tongue.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' /> Seriously, sex is a big deal in our lives, like politics and religion. Interestingly, there's a common saying that you don't have to discuss sex, religion or politics among people you're not very familiar with, or you'll cause a row. I find it wise and in real life I'm saddened that it's almost never observed.In fact, watching the show all together is very much like a conversation at dinner, I think, where HBO is one of the participants. If Mr. HBO comes in and say "I've seen a guy with a knife in the eye," probably the most common reaction among the participants is "Ewww" and it stops there. But if Mr HBO starts describing a loud sex scene in detail, or starts talking only about some girl named Roz, reactions around the table will be most varied and likely to degenerate in a row. So I do believe Mr HBO should at least tone down the sounds, and, in general, exert prudence in dealing with such a delicate and important topic. It's common sense and respect for others, not pruderie, I believe. This is just my theory. I'd like to read a discussion with more "theories" and less "absolute truths" slammed on each other's head.

HTHSimmer down, take a step back from your righteous ire and actually read because what you want to believe you are answering isn't what is being talked about.It's not a question that the scene is about Littlefinger's exposition.  Got that when I watched the scene the first time, as I said a few pages back.  I don't like that they did it, but that's neither here nor there.The point is how does "play with her ass" and showing that add to the scene? Enhance the scene? Ironically, you even said something similar above - they could have been doing almost anything else while LF goes into his Treachery 301: Advanced class dialogue.  It would have been like in the throne room scene having one of the cameras focus on the intestines and spleen of one of Ned's guards while they are being killed/captured.  It doesn't add anything to the scene when there is something else - almost anything else - that could be shown just as effectively.
830	DragonAge93	2011-05-29	Something I'd thought I'd share:"Most readers will complete Â<U+0093>A Game of Thrones,Â<U+0094> the book upon which Game of Thrones is based, in twenty or thirty hours; only speed readers could digest the novel  in less than ten hours.  HBO is tasked with the obligation of presenting the main plot points and character attributes and developments in less than ten hours.  The producers cannot depict every scene of the novel, for to do so would require thirty hours or more of screen time."I pulled that from the sixth essay of Direwolves And Dragons. i know it has been stated before, but I just wanted to share it, since he does have a point.

832	vgz	2011-05-29	The Borgia's has been, despite the historical opportunity, very tame and tasteful for the most part. Rarely throwing us tits and ass for the purpose of ogling. I suppose there's still plenty of room for that to come in their decadent decline but so far it's been a very good show, better than GoT imo. Spartacus was Starz not showtime and was a mixed bag. I didn't exactly like the way they handled nudity but for some reason it never bbothered me anywhere near as much as GoT's use of it has. If they're trying to one up these programmes in tackiness well fair play to them, i suppose they won.I can honestly say I agree with your comments.  I have watched Spartacus Blood and Sand and its prequal and The Borgias and Camelot and I can say that the sex and nudity in these shows did not bother me.  They were done to enhance the story.  But the sex scene in the brothel with LF talking and having to hear the moans etc was just not right.  It bothered me too and I also agree with the poster who said that the moaning and sex in the scene did distract from what LF was saying (to make a point about his character).  Other than that scene I enjoyed the episode and look forward to the next.  To the comments made saying they should give us more important scenes based on the books (which I have read) I agree!!!!!
833	Volderon	2011-05-29	Yeah because Spartacus didn't have random threesomes and orgies at all  /stunned.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':stunned:' /> 
And Borgia's has been a very tame show, you're right. The show has actually been garbage. I stopped at episode 4 because it was ridiculously boring.
Camelot is filled with child "Twilight" stars that wear mascara and aren't dirty at all. The actor that plays Kay should be Arthur, not Edward Cullen 2.0.
This did advance the plot, Littlefinger was talking about his schemes, if the moans bother you, mute it and watch the subtitles.
Let's be thankful we have what those two shows don't have. If it means I have to endure a 5 minute "play with her ass" session, I would pay it gladly every single episode.

At the same time, as previous users have said, the sex scenes are less tolerable in GOT, bc they don't advance the plot. Any of the character developments that have occurred during a sex scene, could've been done without them. That's not to say I'm opposed to the sex, but when it's pointless I don't see the need for it. How is Theon ploughing Roz advancing the storyline? They could've developed his story without the use of a sex scene. The same goes for LF, he could've made viewers aware of his ruthless ambition another way, or even excluded it altogether until his betrayal of Ned. However Cersei's sex scene with Jaime was completely justified and unavoidable, bc it advanced the plot and was a catalyst for Catelyn and Bran's journey.

Just sad that reading comprehension is so low these days.   So now your objection isn't the moans or the naked women or the lesbian sex, it's the phrase "Play with her ass"?  Just trying to nail down what you're objection is, since it seems to change.  As I said before, what the girls did was irrelevant, it's an insight into LF's complete obsession with his own goals no matter what is presented in front of him.You've wrecked your own argument here.  Yes, they could have shown anything and still gotten the point across.  So, you admit they got the point across, so what's the problem with what they said/showed (still not sure what part you object to now).  They can talk about Cersei's c__t (did they have to use that word?), disembowel rapists at Dothraki weddings (close up of disembowelling, where was your outrage then?  What did that shot add to the scene?  Huh?), gurgling deaths, frank descriptions of babies and toddlers killed by being bludgeoned, beheadings, incest, betrayal, etc... GRRM wrote and extremely violent, lewd, sexually frank (with tons of excessive descriptions of wetness and pubic mounds of 14 year old girls), rape filled, defilement (both physical and mental) filled story with excessively graphic content that's nothing other than the worst case scenario of the depths of human behavior... and you're bitching about someone saying "play with her ass" in a surprisingly intense and revealing layered scene.  It's too much!  Waaaaaaaahhhh!  They should've shown Robert get gored instead, even though GRRM didnt.  They didn't show Robert die instead, even though GRRM didn't.  Gold doesn't melt that fast, even though it did when GRRM wrote it.  You guys are killing me looking for ways to moan and whine about the stupidest things.  I've complained about small things, but not content.  My complaints have been all filmmaking issues that I as a professional filmmaker see.  But you guys are just too much.  And btw, GRRM in his books actually talked about various bits of viscera, much akin to showing a cutaway of entrails spewing out of a skewered guard.  If they were to be truer to the books, there'd be more stuff like you talked about in a severely inappropriate comparison.  Many, many posters have posted in here that they watched with friends who didn't read the books and were surprised that LF betrayed Ned.  We have the benefit of hindsight or foreknowledge (somehow it's the same thing here) so what you think tipped away viewers and will somehow drive them away actually seems to have worked exactly as it should've.  After the scene where LF tries to talk Ned into a smooth succession and his soliloqui in the brothel, they'll be smacking their heads and saying "Duh, I should've seen that coming".  But no, you have a problem with LF telling his whores to play with each others' asses!  I wish you could step away and see how utterly ridiculous you sound.  This is the dirtiest, most viscerally and descriptively violent book series I've ever read.  Your objections to base human interaction is nothing short of absurd.

He's teaching the women to go the extra mile to make their clients feel special, as he relates in parallel to his approach to politics.  You don't convince someone they're special by whimpering.  He's six feet from women faking sexual ecstasy.  What sounds are they supposed to make?  I barely even noticed the moans, I concentrated on LF's speech and was rewarded with deep appreciation of a good scene.  Maybe you guys should try doing the same!

You guys are acting like every time he used the word c__t or raped someone that it was only for the sheer advancement of the plot and was absolutely necessary because no other scenario would advance the plot/characters.  /lmao.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lmao:' />  Too much fanboy ignorance going around.  HBO can't show a 14 year old girl getting fingerbanged on her birthday, so they make up the sexuality in other ways.  How does it advance the series?  It gets more viewers interested in the show.  Sex sell.  You want a season 3 or not?  Book fans aren't going to make up enough of an audience for that, others must be drawn in.  When people find out it's a character driven, sexy, violent story and not some D&D prurian geeky teen trolls and giants and knights full of derring do saving vestile virgins, then they'll tune in and keep the seasons coming.  If you can't stomach them just for that reason alone, then you all have a lot of growing up to do.

839	TheEvilKing	2011-05-24	This thread is not for those who have seen the episode early on HBO Go.ALL UP IN HEEEEEEEEEEEREJust love the way Cersei delivers that line.Although the way Tywin flicks his head when he says "a thousand" weirds me out. Still, looking forward to seeing the main man himself. Plus we get some much needed Tywin/Jaime time. There isn't much in the books.Explaining that the future of the Lannisters is at stake, Tywin (Charles Dance) presses Jaime to Â<U+0093>be the man you were meant to beÂ<U+0094> as they prepare for battle.  Ned confronts Cersei about the secrets that killed Jon Arryn. With the fate of the missing Benjen (Joseph Mawle) very much on his mind, Jon Snow takes his NightÂ<U+0092>s Watch vows, though not with the assignment he coveted. After Ser Jorah (Iain Glenn) saves Daenerys from treachery, an enraged Drogo vows to lead the Dothraki where theyÂ<U+0092>ve never gone before. An injured Robert takes pains to ensure an orderly transition at KingÂ<U+0092>s Landing.

I plan to try and wait it out; I'd much rather watch on my TV then on a computer screen or my phone.  Just afraid of showing up here after and finding 20 pages of discussion already waiting /smile.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />  Plus, then I don't have to wait 2 weeks for new shows!

845	Starchaser	2011-05-21	Is it only going to be on HBO Go immediately after or can you watch it all week on HBO Go?
846	Huan	2011-05-21	According to HBO's web site: "Watch the latest Game of Thrones episode online and see Episode 7 this Sunday only on HBO GO." Not clear if it means [this Sunday only] on HBO GO or this Sunday [only on HBO GO]. It sounds like you have to watch Episode 6 on HBO GO first in order to access Episode 7 (presumably one can fast forward through it though).
