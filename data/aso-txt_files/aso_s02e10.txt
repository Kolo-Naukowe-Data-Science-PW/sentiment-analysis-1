"Lord Godric",2012-06-03,"8 it wasnt bad and many of the characters had good stopping points however the house of the undying and the storyline in qarth was lacking i wanted a lot more from the hotu especially the prophecies im glad however that the white walkers have been changed to beyknow white edited by lord godric 03 june 2012  1128 pm"

"Uknownothing",2012-06-03,"i think expecting the translation of a huge literary work to tv or movie to be completely faithful to the book is unrealistic i think if one keeps that in mind and appreciates the work for what it is rather than for what it should be viewing is much more enjoyable overall i find that many of the critics of the show are probably bitter because it seems they are doing a constant compare and contrast in their heads rather than just enjoying the show for its entertainment factor i give the episode a 9"
"_Oberyn_",2012-06-03,"7 barely but very poor indeed arya theon sansa and sam were ok rest was shite it felt like an eternity of whores taking more screen time yet not even 30 seconds could be spared for sir bronn dany was just bolocks but that was expected and jon there were four instances where the plastic swords were too fucking obvious not during the fight"
"CacauCinnamon",2012-06-03,"gave it an 8 not as happy as i hoped to be i really expected more of the house of the undying the scene of sansa being relieved from the wedding was perfect tyrion with shae was lovely and as a book reader well i shouldt comment on that still lovely im not in love with all the changes within aryas storyline also did jaqen say the deaths were to the red god in the books too  because it does not fit with other stuffive read clash of kings last year and after reading all the others so fast i think i end up forgetting some details there were many things i really enjoyed thing i didnt care much about i was completely ok with the change on how winterfell burned i thought it was a good way of gaining time and things i got quite disappointed with overall though i just cant wait for season 3"
"nothatso",2012-06-03,"i felt like despite the departures from the books it was solid tv except for the jon storyline which was completely mishandled this season imo the other departures i didnt feel altered character development quite as much regardless i enjoyed the episode as for the house of the undying does the snow on the throne represent jon was dany then shunning the throne to go beyond the wall and find her family in death did they just spoil the entire series"
"TheHedgeWizard",2012-06-03,"the brienne scene was absolutely brilliant enjoyed the majority of the episode besides that whole robb and talisa secret wedding the house of the undying was pretty decent drogo but i thought we would of seen the actually undying instead of just pyat pree roasted by dragon fire the jonqhorin scene could of been alot better in my opinion one of my favorite parts of the book but not that great in the show overall it was a decent ending to the season now we play the waiting game till season 3"
"Eira Seren",2012-06-04,"am left curious as to the motivation for halfhand picking a fight with jon and does tv jon just kill him because halfhand attacked him and called his mother a whore who burned winterfell and why if there were no defenders otherwise enjoyed ros and varys valar morghulis and brienne and jamie it was really sweet of dany to throw pyat pree a barbeque after everything he put her through"
"J_Crews",2012-06-04,"who burned winterfell and why if there were no defendersbecause thats what it says to do in the medieval warfare 101 textbook under the heading how to sack a citycastle you either occupy it or do your best to destroy it to deny it to others it doesnt matter that there were no defenders  you roundup the populace take everything of value that can be carried then either murder everybody outright or march them off toork your fields kitchens etc peasants sadly were treated as chattel one step above outright slaves its pretty obvious to me ramseys men did the sacking either after letting the ironborn besides theon go free as robb commanded or more likely doublecrossing them after they opened the gates to surrender i guess the ironborn could have done it as a departing f u but then where are ramseys 500 men who were previously besieging them i think ramsey did it with the intent that it be blamed on the ironborni gave this episode a 9 mostly because i have largely separated book and show in my mind into 2 separate entities not totally mind you  they still have to bring the story to the same place but if they go a slightly different route to get there im fine with that the fact is that as much as we book lovers btch about every little change that criticism simply has no bearing on the average tv viewer media buzz ratings and critical assessments are all still very positive edited by jcrews 04 june 2012  0232 am"

"Lord of Cheese",2012-06-04,"i gave it a 510 all the points that were hard hitting in the books were softened down in this episode the lite budget method of story telling and oh yes one last look at ros titts should have had tywin visit tyrion and had tywin say what varys did this is how we start wearing tyrion down until he does you know what eventually hotu was lame dragons could barely puff smoke and suddenly that guy fully catches fire the execution of it was my main gripe too simple too quick just flat why not make drogon break his chain and fly at his face and then burn him make it exciting damn it so danny loses all her servant girls now too"
"Lord of Long Lake",2012-06-04,"why are so many people so negative oh they changed too muchapart from dany not a whole lot was changed and thats because they needed her featured more prominently after such a great season 1all the character development arcs emotions feelings etc are all exactly the same as in the book i thought tyrionshae was an amazing scene that was better than the booktheon showed remorse and desperation just like the book arya developed due to the difficult situations she was put in and frankly interacting with tywin makes for better tv than getting beaten by a dumb chef jon talked with ygritte learnt about the wildlings and killed the halfhand albeit without ghost which was the only thing i was disappointed by and showed how he was torn between serving the halfhand and trying to fight the wildlings sashapetyr seeds were planted for season 3 with petyrs motivations revealed brienne and jaime furthered their relationship meaning more screen time for everyones favorite couple robb married the westerlingvolantis girl which we got to see for the very first time and we got to see a freaking other btw danys dragons for the first time ever used their fire to burn the hotu just like the books oh im sorry all three dragons were there instead meaning there was more fire than in the booksgreat season great child actors not given enough credit i believe since most child actors suck great production quality for a tv show amazing characters and an amazing story even if it varies slightly the story isnt diminished martin who wrote the episode last week made changes please just try to enjoy and stop being so negative at every slight little detail that is changed because one day the show will no longer be on air and every single person on the forum and every fan of the book andor show will think damn that was one of the best shows on tv and i complained about every tiny detail almost the whole time it was on air the episode may not have been a 1010 but the season as a whole has been a whole lot better than glee which i will never watch or whatever bs is on tv these dayslast thing season 3 droolgif classbbcemoticon altdrool "

"Mexal",2012-06-04,"i gave it a 7 but to be honest my biggest issues with this series has nothing to do with the changes though i do miss all the mythhistory but i assume at some point theyll get to it but the storytelling structure the best episodes have been the ones where its tightly focused where only 23 stories are being told instead of 5 minutes spent on each story i want more of those every episode that features all the stories is comparably weaker to the stories that are tighter episode 3 and 9 are great examples of this if that doesnt change i will continue to be underwhelmed for part of the season"

"daoloth",2012-06-04,"hi everyonethis is my first post so please forgive me the lenght of it i can without any reservations give the final episode of the series a very strong zeroit was a huge letdown in term of overall writing concept and annoying cheesiness and in particular  lack of proper plot execution for a season finale the important thing is that the fault lies almost exclusively with the writers of the show every other aspect of the show was satisfactory at worst it were mr benioff and mr weiss that completely butchered the episode and the season for me i would be more satisfied if the previous episode written by marint was the last one this season  even though it left so many subplots completely unresolved this is the masure ot bw failure  or rather i should say a proof of their utter and complete lack of talent and imagination direction scenography actorseverything was great good or just ok except for the story a bundle of chaotic pointless and downright annoying ideas of how to completely butcher a great story and fascinating characters there were some great scenes in the episode most importantly theon  the only pov character untouched by benioff and weiss lack of writing skill and imagination arya and tyrion were quite decent believable fairly faithful to the spirit of their characters and quite well played the problem with arya is that the scene was taken out of context which completely killed an interesting pov subplot tyrion was treated unspeakably in this episode not only we get very little of his loss of status which is a pivotal point to many many events in the season and will be in the next one hopefully but also we get the annoying goodhearted whore shae againto make things worse the writers get their motivations backwards to what they were in the novels it is entirely believable with tyrion since he is a bit different character here but that can only mean that shae is going to be yet another whore saint in the futurevarys was great as usual and i cant only understand why we were fed this annoying whore ros to show a pair of regulation tits stannis again is a pale distant shade of the stannis we know from the books and some of the better scenes in the series apparently he suffered some head injury when he charged the walls last week because he acts a little like a bipolar personality since the writers decided to forgo the struggle between melissandre and stannis men altogether why i will never know  it was fundamental to his story his violent reaction to her makes some sort of sense yet when he is shown some pivotal revelation in the flames it is underplayed at best what did he see himself on the iron throne because there was no single sign in the season that melissandre is about anything more serious than some dynastic dispute the scenes with robb and bran were boring robb in particular lost all his tragic elements with the way his story was handled the tension between him and cat was close to nonexistant and his marriage to oona chaplin makes him immature and unreliable not tragically conflicted and young as in the novels i pitied martins robb  this one seriously gets on my nerves also his new wifes profile is surprisingly unattractive catelyn was decent and her exchange with jaime a few episodes back certainly made her a bit more faithful to the novels these were the good and decent scenes here come the bad the really bad and the truly monstrously awful first sansacerseijoffreyetc horse taking a dump  fan favourite forced spoils of war artificial and forced bethrodal of margaery unbelievable and primitive and it doesnt work even with the revamped golddigger margaery of the series sansas reaction well was she happy or sad and what was the business with baelish the whole scene made no sense other than introduced some plot elements for future seasons and showed off actors on payroll sandor clegane was right  fk the king it would be sooo much better to have pycelle or varys or bronn tell that to tyrion since that would give more screen time to a better and more important character lord tywin was painfully disappoiniting also he is so much more interesting than a guy on a horse then comes jaime to show how deadly brienne is we have her fight jaime win and humiliate him and then they both get caught by mummers and jaime loses his sword handend of scene  great cliffhanger only that never happened instead we get some idiotic and pointless scene that takes up time and moves the story nowhere but it can get better next on the list is daenerys it is truly unfair to complain about

"daoloth",2012-06-04,"hi everyonethis is my first post so please forgive me the lenght of it i can without any reservations give the final episode of the series a very strong zeroit was a huge letdown in term of overall writing concept and annoying cheesiness and in particular  lack of proper plot execution for a season finale the important thing is that the fault lies almost exclusively with the writers of the show every other aspect of the show was satisfactory at worst it were mr benioff and mr weiss that completely butchered the episode and the season for me i would be more satisfied if the previous episode written by marint was the last one this season  even though it left so many subplots completely unresolved this is the masure ot bw failure  or rather i should say a proof of their utter and complete lack of talent and imagination direction scenography actorseverything was great good or just ok except for the story a bundle of chaotic pointless and downright annoying ideas of how to completely butcher a great story and fascinating characters there were some great scenes in the episode most importantly theon  the only pov character untouched by benioff and weiss lack of writing skill and imagination arya and tyrion were quite decent believable fairly faithful to the spirit of their characters and quite well played the problem with arya is that the scene was taken out of context which completely killed an interesting pov subplot tyrion was treated unspeakably in this episode not only we get very little of his loss of status which is a pivotal point to many many events in the season and will be in the next one hopefully but also we get the annoying goodhearted whore shae againto make things worse the writers get their motivations backwards to what they were in the novels it is entirely believable with tyrion since he is a bit different character here but that can only mean that shae is going to be yet another whore saint in the futurevarys was great as usual and i cant only understand why we were fed this annoying whore ros to show a pair of regulation tits stannis again is a pale distant shade of the stannis we know from the books and some of the better scenes in the series apparently he suffered some head injury when he charged the walls last week because he acts a little like a bipolar personality since the writers decided to forgo the struggle between melissandre and stannis men altogether why i will never know  it was fundamental to his story his violent reaction to her makes some sort of sense yet when he is shown some pivotal revelation in the flames it is underplayed at best what did he see himself on the iron throne because there was no single sign in the season that melissandre is about anything more serious than some dynastic dispute the scenes with robb and bran were boring robb in particular lost all his tragic elements with the way his story was handled the tension between him and cat was close to nonexistant and his marriage to oona chaplin makes him immature and unreliable not tragically conflicted and young as in the novels i pitied martins robb  this one seriously gets on my nerves also his new wifes profile is surprisingly unattractive catelyn was decent and her exchange with jaime a few episodes back certainly made her a bit more faithful to the novels these were the good and decent scenes here come the bad the really bad and the truly monstrously awful first sansacerseijoffreyetc horse taking a dump  fan favourite forced spoils of war artificial and forced bethrodal of margaery unbelievable and primitive and it doesnt work even with the revamped golddigger margaery of the series sansas reaction well was she happy or sad and what was the business with baelish the whole scene made no sense other than introduced some plot elements for future seasons and showed off actors on payroll sandor clegane was right  fk the king it would be sooo much better to have pycelle or varys or bronn tell that to tyrion since that would give more screen time to a better and more important character lord tywin was painfully disappoiniting also he is so much more interesting than a guy on a horse then comes jaime to show how deadly brienne is we have her fight jaime win and humiliate him and then they both get caught by mummers and jaime loses his sword handend of scene  great cliffhanger only that never happened instead we get some idiotic and pointless scene that takes up time and moves the story nowhere but it can get better next on the list is daenerys it is truly unfair to complain about the lamest most artificial and forced main character in the whole series for once it is because this daenerys is obviously some other daenerys probably some stupid dd character i am half ready to

"a shadow",2012-06-04,"i think expecting the translation of a huge literary work to tv or movie to be completely faithful to the book is unrealistic no one is throwing their hands in the air and crying for gods there are really reasonable suggestions while sticking to the books to every development is not asked changing good original stuff with some blant stuff out of nowhere is bad it becomes a song of ice and fire  made in china i did not think this episode was so bad certainly not the worst of the season but lets give this episode and every episode respect with not talking in generalisations and the beaten to death ones"

"daoloth",2012-06-04,"grrm liked foreshadowing events with omens i sadly think that the title valar morghulis is such an omen the quality of the episode suggested that the main creative force behind the series  benioff and weiss are out of their depth by far first season was easy because the book was shorter less descriptive and had fever pov characters in fewer locations it was easier to adapt then because all you needed to do is simply translate the book page by page into a script with cok they had to do some creative work and it is clear they failed miserably they completely lost story arcs relating to the others plenty of subtle hints in the novels and the coming of age for many of the primary pov characters they completely butchered the nature of the world  they shades of grey rather than black and white catelyn was greyed properly in season 2 by jamie finally robb turns out to be stupid not tragic with his marriage sansa wasnt naive and childish and confronted with harsh reality not known from songs and tales but just well blandand boring bran is nothing special in season 2 and why dany is terrible it is actually painful to watch i often skip her scenes when watching again the show turns out to be predictable and full of cliches everywhere the writers have a say and there is political correctness which annoys the hell out of me in sf and fantasy settings it took a chunk of a amazing realism which martin put into his worldarranged marriages are rarely seen for what they really were as if the mere concept was offending to even things out all whores are saints  so we get a lot of shae and ros and other saintly prostitutesygritte turns out to be just a dumb horny btch from your regular high school and not the feisty freeminded woman who believes that jon snow stole her as it was her peoples custom and who by the way was a bastard born out of wedlock  huge problem south of the wall no problem up north but apparently he chose the watch because black was always his color he just looks good in it"

"evening gale",2012-06-04,"really the only thing that stopped this from being a ten was the house of the undying but lets be honest theyve fucked dany up so much this season was anyone expecting anything less i even liked her walking out of the throne room to the other side of the wall considering thats where her real war will be but the way she was chained and killed pyat pree was justim convinced dd are part of the crew that hate dany and are trying as hard as they can to make the tv folk do the samei havent read the books but i plan to start them this summer i will say that dany is my least favorite character and her story line is by far the least interesting to me as a nonreader i think hbo spent too many precious minutes in the final episode on her her meanderings through the house of the undying were very boring and seemed pointless in moving the story forward but im sure its essential in the books i really have to say i do not much care what happens to her yet i have a feeling that she and her dragons will play a very important role in dealing with the white walkers someday so why is hbo making her story line so blandotherwise i give it an 8"
"daoloth",2012-06-04,"what the heck do you not know what happened at the fist of the first menthat was sarcasm a tv show is governed by different rules than the books but it doesnt mean that it can stop making sense for example hotu visions should obviously be different for claritys sake but who they are now unintelligible and drogo that was waste of timewhat she was told and shown in the hotu moves the next two books forward and not backwards similarly the others have an intricate backstory in the books and in the show they are random monsters that look like blue crap blue crap good art in a tv show is not about flashy cgi unless you are 7 and watch transformers also if there is no sensible mythology regarding whitewalkers in the show  and there isnt so far the second season is much more fun to watch if you read the books mostly because spotting characters and events from the book is so much fun but it is much weaker as a whole and on its own being a fan of the series does not mean you need to put 5 of 5stars everywhere like some fanboisbut perhaps you would also like to give 910 to this steaming piece of marketing crap that was known as lost seasons 3 to 6 in this case i would ask whether you might have charged kings landing with stannis without helmets"

"rmholt",2012-06-05,"8 the robbcat dialog sucked as did the robb wedding they have to cut so much out of the book why add needless stuff i could almost see jons sword underneath quorins armpit i get the impression the extras in iceland became sparse after the first few scenes i did like what they did with the house of the undying it was totally made up and none of the portents were there but it worked for me the zombie parade was pretty cool dragonsteel is supposed to be blue but other colors were messed up too clarke is a weak actress i did like seeing sansa smile  tho the lecherous baelish put a stop to that briennejaime very well done awesome weirwood tree at winterfell jaqen was supposed to be heading for euron not braavos so i hope the continuity holds the faceless men are not supposed to kill for themselves well maybe beginners anyway big wuss out on tyrions scar pycelle is not only growing back his beard he is becoming a wise ass edited by rmholt 05 june 2012  0136 am"
"Daenerys",2012-06-05,"9 right up there with blackwater imo easily the two best episodes of the season were the last two for me i love the books but i really dont give a fig if they stay completely true to them in fact i think the show gets better the more they feel free to depart from them hopefully next season they will really rethink it as the original production it deserves to be especially daenerys story which quite frankly is a very long drawn out bore in the books already and is really showing the strain on television all i ask is that they keep the spirit of the books most of the central themes and keep the focus on the main characters overall i give this season a 7 but at least it ended on a strong note or notes edited by daenerys 05 june 2012  0159 am"
"Demojan777",2012-06-05,"810it worked for me i can understand certain people who are big fans of the books being disappointed from the departures but i think that too many people in this community some of them longtime members who you usually expect to be the voice of reason on most websites and forums becoming completely alarmist about changes from book to tvi dont 100 agree with the choices made this season my main pet peeve this episode was the white walker just looking at sam and moving on like hes of no consequence and ive had one or two pet peeves per episode this season with the exception of the superb blackwater but i doubt any of the people who have lost faith or are over this show could have come anywhere near as close to succeeding in pulling off a tv show adaptation of a book series of such depth and complexity while still ending up with something that appeals to such a wide audience as the producers and writers of game of thrones havepurists alarmists and naysayers can all watch something else if they want to but i believe the show will succeed regardless can you imagine how offthewall crazy this story would have gone offtrack with a movie or series of movies instead of a tv show wed have people having aneurysms in midpost all over these forumsmany of my friends dont read books for pleasure like i do and they all love got i love both the books and the tv show and based on the first five books and two seasons i will continue to love them both until theyre all done and over with"

"Tywin",2012-06-05,"awful absolutely awful there are so many changes from the book and all of them are terrible the bastard of bolton doesnt sack winterfell the maester luwin scene is bungled and he looks full of vitality even though hes supposed to be dying and this would be confusing for nonbookreaders the house of the undying is just pathetic the conclusion to the qarth part of the series  with danaerys storming the city with a few men  is absurd ghost doesnt intervene in the fight with qhorin halfhand the dire wolves were almost entirely absent this season samwell hides behind a rock in the midst of an undead horde which is goofy and unnecessary he could have watched from a cliff shae is being presented as humane when shes supposed to be presented as materialistic i could go on and onthe excuse that they have to cover so much ground in a single episode is not enough to get them off the hook for this they could have easily had the bolton men instead of pyke men sack winterfell for example they keep taking liberties and all these liberties are stupid instead of trying to translate a work of genius as well as possible to television they are trying to improve upon it predictably theyre failingmy views exactly barely scraped a six this but only because i look it it all through the eyes of a book reader"
"TheEvilKing",2012-06-05,"gave it a 9 good stuff  all the kings landing scenes were handled especially well the throne room scene in particular was awesome also tywins horse pooing  maester luwin  i teared up what a bro  also the scene with luwin and theon was brilliant  theons speech was epic not sure what to make of what happened after that though i suppose with the lack of budget and reek they couldnt do much else  the ending was pretty dope house of the undying stuff i was prepared for the house of the undying to be vastly different from the books the scene in the iron throne room was particularly beautiful and haunting however i did want to hear the three fires prophecy i love that particular part in the books and missed it on the show not so good stuff  jon snows storyline was completely bungled this season what should have been his best scene was the most confusing and disappointing ah well hopefully with mance and tormund and co next season things will improve for jonny boy  i found myself not giving a crap about robbs scenes  brienne giving that guy a slow death seemed totally out of character but unfortunately the writers seem to want to make every character more badass in order to appeal to tv viewers i didnt have a problem with them doing that with ned or robb or stannis but brienne defeats her whole character  stannis strangling mel what the hell was that i really feel like the writers felt they made him too likeable with his heroics at the blackwater so lets show him choking a bitch also no davos appearance makes me wonder if theyve actually killed him off  doreah noooooooooooooooo why khaleesi whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy"

"Dannyisnow",2012-06-05,"i gave it a 1010 however on reflection it was probably a 910 for me im a book reader  half way through dance of dragons  and loved it just the same the only thing that was a slight let down was the lack of hallucinations in the hotu i didnt dislike the throne room scene and drogo but i think there was room for a few flashes depicting some of the elements described in the book the dragons burning pyat pree scene was awesome  overall i thought the episode was fantastic bowdowngif classbbcemoticon altbowdown  now all i need is the bluray  which im guessing we will have to wait atleast another 1011 months grrr  banggif classbbcemoticon altbang "
"Ashas Globetrotter",2012-06-05,"the butterfly effect is getting stronger and stronger the total change of hotu will cause big ripples throughout the show as the visions become such a strong part of dany in the books to follow also as propechies for the readers to digest considering the future of westeros i guess this all somehow got too complicated for the writers sadly it seems they dont want the readers guessing or being deceived as grrm does my guess is the writers dont know all the story they just get their chapters to adapt without considering the butterfly effect something which is dangerous for a work like asoiaf where almost everything is connected so needless to say im a very eager to see how they will handle rw worst case it will be no supriseno shock at all i guess us readers just have to continue to work on separating the show from the books cause it can only get more different as the road winds and be grateful for the fact that the books have made it to the screen at all"
"Catherine Storm",2012-06-05,"the last 2 episodes made up for more the whole season for me happy with it except the rush sacking of winterfell was in tears with luwin in the gods wood with the boys exactly as i imagined it except for his relief that they were alive"
"stevanjo",2012-06-05,"ok so my opinion is simply split here as for the entire season looking from a point of nonreader which is ofcourse extremley hard i belive this was an awesome season easily a 910 and its a 9 just beacuse many things had to be rushed and could leave some of the viewers puzzled looking froma a point of reader i must say i feel a bit dissapointed in general many things are done right and according to the book but there are so many things that were simply strange and didnt agree with me just looking at the last episode robs wedding doreah sleeping with xaro shae and tyrions relationship but 2 that botherd me the most were stannis and hotu both of those sceans were great on their on but they felt simply wrong compared to the book though we never see staniss reaction in the aftermath of the battle in the book i feel what they did here was completly out of character stannis getting all enraged and choking mel it felt so completly wrong and in general through the whole season his character seems so much different from the teeth grinding book stannis and hotu was done so cause of budget and so on and so on but by god if u already have danny at the wall show the blue flower it doesnt reveal anything special but it is such a great moment in the book when you relize what it symbolizes all in all standolne season and this episode get 910 from me as for how i rate it as a true adaptaion something like 610 but maybe im wanting too much from this cause i love the books so much"
"goonerjon777",2012-06-05,"i gave it a 9 so many opinions for the good and so many for the bad i guess the tv efforts have an impossible job to please all we should all count our selves lucky that we have this tv adaptation ive read the books ive watched the shows what am i to do til season 3 cant wait  thats all there is to say"
"Sam R",2012-06-05,"i gave it a 7 but to be honest my biggest issues with this series has nothing to do with the changes though i do miss all the mythhistory but i assume at some point theyll get to it but the storytelling structure the best episodes have been the ones where its tightly focused where only 23 stories are being told instead of 5 minutes spent on each story i want more of those every episode that features all the stories is comparably weaker to the stories that are tighter episode 3 and 9 are great examples of thisif that doesnt change i will continue to be underwhelmed for part of the seasoni agree the problem is there are just so many subplots that intersect its not like mad men where we could have an entire episode about peggy then one about don because theres not much going on plotwise game of thrones has so much plot happening that if we spent an entire episode with tyrion we would miss crucial cersei scenes or whatever and if we had an entire jon episode we would be behind on everything elsebut man if they could make it work i would love to see an episode that just took like 2 or 3 characters and worked through heaps of their stuff then did the same for different characters the next episode and so on and so on like if this season they had had an episode that was like 40 stannis 40 theon 20 tyrion then did 40 robb 40 dany 20 tyrion next week or whatever that could have worked better because there would be more breathing space for character developmentim no showrunner or tv writer though so i dont know how it all works but i hope next season they tackle the issue of pacing and structure a lot more because it could possibly become a big problem if they keep going how theyre goinganyways id give this episode an 8 its a television show based off a book series not an identical adaptation of a book series when tv theon does something im thinking of tv theon not book theon in my mind the two stories are as divorced as i can make them i enjoy the books and the show much better that way i much preferred jon vs qhorin in the show as it added some ambiguity which makes jon more interesting i think it took much later for jon to get interesting in the books for this very reason he was too good all of the time not enough moral ambiguity did jon kill him because he understood he qhorin wanted him to infilitrate the wildings or did he do it because he was angry at qhorin or was it both that sort of stuff is greathouse of the undying was alright loved the thronewalldrogo visions the ending with pyat fell a bit flat but i liked the ending of this arc dany has learned to place her dragons above all else ambition and family and has sort of accepted being a dothraki conquerer type leader by stealing the gold also learnt not to trust so easily not the same lessons she learnt in acok mainly but still good ones that made character sensetheons ending confused me as a bookreader but thinking from a showwatcher perspective it makes more sense although it was still pretty clumsy i think the idea is to trick the viewers into thinking the ironborn did it as they left winterfell just like the rest of westeros thinks then next season to create a season 3 plotline for alfie allen explore that it was actually ramsay and so on revealing it was ramsay right away would probably get viewers a bit apprehensive about roose yes ramsay may have acted against his fathers orders but that wouldnt be everyones first thought which makes the red wedding less surprising and i bet season 3 is all about building to the red weddingseason 2 was stronger than season 1 in my eyes because it tried to tie the episodes together thematically rather than just break a season long plot into 10 episodes like i felt season 1 did"
"Serr Parker",2012-06-05,"depends what context youre rating it by if youre rating it as an adaptation of the book it was very different but you should have realised by this point it wasnt going to be word for word the same if youre rating it as a piece of television though it was fantastic i cant think of a better tv series than this at the minute i gave it a 9 i enjoying it a lot but there would have been one or two things i would have maybe changed"

"Warden of the North121",2012-06-05,"while i enjoy this show it is clear comparing blackwater to episodes that dd have written that grrm makes these guys look like amateurs that being said this show is still fantastic and would be flawless in my opinion if they found some more creative and thorough writers if theyre really adamant making changes from the source material edited by warden of the north121 05 june 2012  0815 am"

"The Knight of Flours",2012-06-05,"i had trouble getting in here for quite a while so interesting to read the complaints in the first few pages as an adaptation i am very happy with the show and realise they cant show every detail from the book and  due to the medium  have to change some things this will happen in future seasons as dd have to stretch some stories  eg theon  over the next few series as with robb and jamie this season the fate of winterfell is bound to be explored early in s3 and give the tv audience an understanding of the shift in power up north plenty of other characters shirene the reeds the bastard being held over as a book reader i probably enjoyed the series more than some of my nonreading friends who thought some episodes were a bit slow im glad that s34 is likely to spark them up again my only criticism is that the three horns cliffhanger could have been even more effective with a less is more approach a few things during the series i didnt like but ill wait to see how these storylines play out next year before making my mind up 910 for this necessary epilogue to s2"
"GOTgirl",2012-06-05,"had to give it a 9 i thought it was great but not as good as blackwater although many people have valid gripes with the hotu scenes i myself would have liked to see more but understand thats not going to happen i liked it and found it rather emotional loved seeing dany in the throne room and lets face ittheyve already messed her storyline up a great deal this seasoni was actually expecting less from this part of the story was hoping to see rhaegar though the jon scene i wish they had done differently as theyve done it i think many nonbook readers are left wondering what the heck jon is doing if they had taken just a few moments and lines of dialouge more they truly could have explained it and given qhuorin halfhand a more honorable death which truly showed the sacrifice made for the nights watchthe scene would have ended up better with a more emotional impact and where the heck is ghost yes overall a 9 because unlike other episodes this season this one left me wanting more i truly liked it a lot and i must say the white walkers looked bad ass this time"

"UnCleos",2012-06-05,"long time lurker first time poster i gave it an 8 and that is rating it purely as a television show as an adaptation as many of you have said it failed in this episode particuarly in contrast to the magnificently written blackwater credit to george obviously it looked even worse although i am touching on things everyone else has discussed id also like to speak on a few points that bothered me throughout the season many characters were changed or made to do things that hurt them for the audience for a few cheap thrills and crowd pleasing moments jaime killing alton like some common psychopath just for a violent scene robb marrying not for honor but for being horny and in love for petty romance and pleasing the masses stannis sleeping with mel immediately just from a lame promise of a son came off as so rushed especially with the audience only having seen them for one episode since then it just screamed amateur writing to me no care taken with such deep characters that is my main point the rushing of this season so many scenes so many episodes storylines character arcs either rushed or abandoned it made it seem as if benoiff and weiss only wanted to get cok out of the way so they could move on to the epic third book and of course the rw many nonbook readers that i spoke to felt as if nothing had happened this season because so many points were glossed over the importance of the freys to robb his betrayal is more than the loss of a damn bridge arya not developing at all instead being babied by tywin also lost alot of possible roose characterization by omitting his role at harrenhal which is really a damn shame because he is a fantastic character and i will not even get into how bungled and rushed jons storyline felt danys was made to be action packed but felt absolutely tacky and silly for most of the season tyrion and theon were handled well although as many have mentioned theons final scene was unbelievably disappointing i hope i am wrong but the more i look at the resume of benoiff and weiss the less faith i develop in this series doing justice as it progresses every great television show seems to have a season in which it stutters early on though so there is hope it is such a shame that clash of kings a great second book in martins series was given a bit of a halfassed treatment by these two all that being said i am still looking forward to the third season much of that will be to witness what will live up to be the most shocking scene in television history we all know what at least in my opinion beyond that jaime and brienne will feature heavily and they are both doing a fantastic job nikolaj is always capivating on the screen sos gives them magnificent material and they damn well better try to do it justice here is hoping for next season coming on strong"

"Lyana",2012-06-05,"well i really really tried to watch the show and not think about the books i just watched it like i watched the first season i havent read the series at that time i saw how excited my nonbook reader freinds were about this episode and i think it worked it was really pleasant and liberating not to compare every single detail with the book so i gave it a 10 this episode was not as spectacular as the previous one but that also was not its purpose and i have to say im really relieved that alan taylor is back on board as a director although blackwater was one of the best episodes it it safe to say for me at least that neil marshall wasnt the right choice this episode felt complete every storyline got his proper ending and the final scene made my blood freeze those are pretty good reasons to be satisfied with the seasons ending"
"johnnysd",2012-06-05,"i gave it a 5i know a bit harsh it was a good season overall but this episode for me was just a lacklusterthe house of the undying was when i first put together the whole lrj theory that i later came to find out that it was pretty popular when i joined this forumi know its just a theory but i came to accept it as almost truth and i really wanted to see how the series was gonna deal with thatignoring the whole passage was just a big disappointmentalso all of the ones loyal to dany were betraying her or dying i mean its interesting but her life was already hard enough with the few friends she hadanother thing was the burning of winterfell that moment was hugely emotional for me and in the series it was treated as whatever they burned the castle ehother than that the episode was nice jaqen was great and so was tyrion and really i just love natalie dormerand as for the splitting of the stark kids heres to hoping theyll introduce the reeds next season to promote that cheersgif classbbcemoticon altcheers people seem to forget that unless they made them like twin peaks the hotu visions would be incredibly spoilery to the point of ruining some events in future seasons people also forget i think the economy of a visual medium and how quicky they can introduce elements like johns parentage and make it exciting in books they have to hold our interest for a much much longer time so things need to be implied and hinted at like grrm does otherwise it would be pure exposition which always brings fantasy books to a screeching halt"
"Akisut84",2012-06-05,"i think expecting the translation of a huge literary work to tv or movie to be completely faithful to the book is unrealistic i think if one keeps that in mind and appreciates the work for what it is rather than for what it should be viewing is much more enjoyable overall i find that many of the critics of the show are probably bitter because it seems they are doing a constant compare and contrast in their heads rather than just enjoying the show for its entertainment factor i give the episode a 9yes it would have been unrealistic to expect after a very successful first series to try to invest more money into it it would have been really unrealistic to see the west burned by robb to see riverrun to see the riverlands burning and to see the real horror of war to see a bit of storms end to make people understand why jon had to kill the halfhand it would have been unrealistic to show a circling eagle in the sky as they march and to show ghost just to get into the warg project instead its realistic to show scenes about jon and ygritte talking about knives and stones it would have been unrealistic to see robb as the strong king who beheads karstark himself and marry a westerling girl as the westerlings are bannermen of the lannisters instead it was realistic to show him weak and with a whoknowswhothatgirlwas flirting and listening stories about how a slave saved her brother meh it would have been unrealistic to show the prophecies in thou to show rhaegar and the pwwp to see the undyings themselves and not just pyat pree although i liked the scene when he walked into the destroyed throne room covered by snow and went over the wall it would have been unrealistic to show the bastard of bolton and his tricks it would have been unrealistic to jaime not to kill cleos frey as a kinslayer is cursed by men and gods old and new and it is the worst sin as there could be future references to that it would have been unrealistic to cook the weasel soup and show the brave companions and so on and on and onyou see i really tried to enjoy the show and at most part i could i tried not to compare and contrast i talked to people who didnt read the books and they absolutely loved it but when i started to ask questions if they understood why things happened in the way the did they were really not suremaybe its my fault that i read the books three times and saw things differently in the show than i imagined them during reading and i wouldnt complain about that but sorry it cant be my fault to not to see the things at all or see them completely twisted around im not talking about minor things im not talking about eye colours and make ups im talking about important plots bolton and vargo hoat westerlings and tywin main cities storms end riverrun and main characters edmure tully hoster tully blackfish reeds bastard of bolton big and little walders etc  i know hbo ordered only 10 episodes and they couldnt show everything but if they found time for showing us renly and loras in bed ygritte making jests about jons manneeds tywin lannister being the good fella and telling stories to a cupbearer then they could have been a bit unrealistic and show us a bit of the above things as well im very happy that so many people enjoyed the show but why should we who did not enjoyed it that much should shut our mouths and do not criticise it people call us haters but we just feel sorry that a purely epic story was turned into an above the average tv show"

"Lachezar",2012-06-06,"5 a mediocre finale of a mediocre season the only thing i liked in this season is scenery and armorsoutfits of the cast in comparison to s1 this season was so shit its tragic dannys acting while she was chained  so bad excluding the fact that the whole chaining stuff was terrible dragons throwing flames like flamethrowers was silly xaro all of the sudden being macho instead of loving boys danny taking over the city with an newly spawned army all of the sudden book spoiler that mandon moore was cersei catspaw snowing in kings landing major spoiler either the winter came lol or jon is sitting on the throne  which is kinda the same qorin storyline instead of beeing the most feared nightswatch guy meh could go on forever but cannot be arsed they better let 1 guy write stories for next season for more consistency this was shit"

"HyacinthGirl",2012-06-06,"sothe first part of your post is funny touche who cant take a little ribbingbut the complaints arent always about playing spot the difference twixt book and tv show i think but could be wrong that nonbook readers are wondering why the halfhand is so mad at jon for not killing ygritte and going awol to the point of being captured that he wants to literally pick a fight with him here  now and kill him as a traitor because im wondering it myself i kept thinking he was going to whisper to jon about infiltrating the wildlings did i miss this i have to watch clips on youtube this yearand im sorry but the other looked like something out of the jim henson workshop why didnt it kill sam exactly is sam toting around the bundle of dragonglass like some kind of others kryptonite not that nonbookies would understand its significance yet so that cant be it i guess hes too insignificant a threat to them though that never stopped them from killing children am i wrong did it not notice sam behind the rockdidnt mind how the shae  tyrion relationship has shaped up cant believe they wasted more time on ros in this episode wtf being enlisted by varys cmon wasted scene people it seems we will never be free of this invented persona while other characters have been merged eliminated namechanged etc maybe she ends up being the one to betray tyrion later  and thank goodness he gets to keep his nose not even rorge was missing a nose during his brief screen timei dont see the point of saving ser dontos earlier in the season because if he shows up in s3 nonbook readers will say wait tell me who that is againliked that little touch with theon being driven to total exasperation by that damn horn though the horn sounded so fake but did i miss something between theon being knocked unconscious and the burnt ruin arent nonbookies wondering what exactly happened to the ironborn and which parties did the burning i know what a cliffhanger is but this one seemed a bit of a gapcertainly dont mind that bran is being wheeled off in a cart instead of expecting poor hodor to carry him on his back the whole damn way    dont mind that luwin dies at the weirwood and osha finishes him off actually not in the book is itim just not going to say oh im so grateful theyre making this series at all that therefore every episode is the best they could do for television 10 out of 10 perfect scorei gave it a 10 because i enjoyed it i just cant understand all of the extreme negativity i see on here because i think the show is incredible i know that im a lot more lenient than some book readers when it comes to departures from the original material but thats only because im so impressed with the cast sets costumes etc and yes most of the writing and im a pretty laid back personit was never going to be a word for word adaptation and no tv show is as powerful as the human imagination but there is so much outrage on these boards its not like the show writers are rewriting your copy of acok  the original version of the hotu still exists go read it if you prefer it and i do but i wouldnt go so far as to call the show version insulting as some people doas for the samother thing the other might take a swing at sam when we next return to the fist blimey who cares if that scene looked like the walking dead it was awesome and so scary and have people who complained about the zombies not realised that the wights arewell zombiesactually we agree about ros its an old complaint but if theyre going to trim bits of the story that are important due to time constraints they have to replace it with something more substantial than ros boobsfor the sake of practicality can you imagine how difficult it would be to have basically the main character on the show missing a nose and rorges missing nose was creepy as fuck in the books but not not really necessary in the show when you think about prosthetics and stuff as for ser dontos maybe they were using him to show sansas nature off a bit im not sureit was pretty obvious to me that the bastards boys burnt winterfell but yes id have no idea of that if i hadnt read the books im sure theyll explore it later on it was pretty obvious to the audience book readers and non readers alike that theon couldnt have ordered the destruction of winterfell because he was unconciousoh and as for qhorin whispering to jon about infiltrating the wildlings sadly he didnt do it in this episode but in episode 8 i think he said something about one man inside the army being worth 100 fighting against iti know that spot the difference is a pretty loose term i havent been reading the books for as long as some of you have  doesnt mean i love them any less but i can understand how something youve devoted a lot of time to over many years being brought to tv only to disappoint would be unenjoyable but it doesnt disappoint me and so im able to defend it like this some of the complaints on these boards syrio has hair just seem so petty to me some obviously more substantial jon  qhorin  im not really sure why they changed that because it was one of my favourite things in acok or hotu  which could never have been as good as it was in the books but everyone sees things differently i dont want to argue with you or anyone and im sorry you havent enjoyed this episode because i really liked it edited by

"TeamDanyArya",2012-06-06,"im curious why do people expect to see absolutely everything as it happens identical to the books the producers have said time and time again they have delayed certain characters for future seasons so as to not completely confuse the audience and because of expenses it doesnt mean certain storylines are being ditched in their entirety we may still get cat going to riverrun we are getting the reeds ugh but not until season 3 we are getting ramsay bolton but not until season 3 some of the reordering i think in the long haul will make sense wait until youve seen the whole damn series before getting upset why do people expect major characters to be completely fleshed out even though they arent by the end of book 2 let alone by book 5 right away do some not understand character development was that not gone over in any english youve ever taken for people who can slog through thousands of pages and be patient to see where things are going a lot of you seem to demand instant gratification from the tv show get over yourself and just enjoy the damn thing and if you cant stop watching and stop whining about every injustice there are things i like and things i dont but i dont browbeat stuff i dont let it kill my overall enjoyment for the best show on tv because it is wellacted usually wellwritten and is just so different from anything else for example i hate ros dont get why shes still around but maybe shell serve some purpose after all besides breasts that being said i hope they keep her in extremely low doses however i dont let that destroy things for me robbs being an idiot but then again he was an idiot in the books with his quickie marriage he may be a badass on the field but he is still young and prone to making mistake in his personal life while talisa may not be jeyne westerling its still the same concept so again that change in character name doesnt bother me"
"Blangadanger",2012-06-06,"perhaps it was because i was very pessimistic about the hotu scene being translated onscreen faithfully or otherwise i figured they would digitize it to death i was pleasantly surprised at how well it came across on the screen it didnt have nearly the amount of prophecies of the book but that would have taken at least one entire episode of television instead it was a very stripped down version of dany coming to grips about her own identity when she exits the dream and sees her dragon strongdany is back and with a vengeance i loved her reaction to the empty safe i was also worried they would attempt to end every storyline in one episode but that also appeared to be unjustified since they wrap up each story pretty well tyrions scene was fantastic easily one of the best scenes of the entire series sansas scene in court was great as well i love that we get a glimpse of jaime being impressed by briennes adept skills in battle the final scenes of jaqen hghar and maester luwin were sad because the actors that played them have been wonderful alfie allens two speeches were stirring but ultimately his scene proved anticlimatic as they just cut to winterfell burning i did not think that the transition was smooth and it didnt impact me enough to see the mighty city destroyed equally unsatisfying was jons battle with qhorin which had very little context or explanation for it occurring in the first place my nonbook reader friend had some semblance of understanding since they touched on the false betrayal two episodes ago but the way they left it ambiguous in the end was poorly thought out in my opinion though sams interactions with the walkers was terrifying i thought it felt out of place in relation to the rest of the season it didnt have the same emotional impact as the high fantasy ending to season 1 as im guessing they wanted it to have instead i think it would have made more sense to end with a more prolonged betrayal of qhorin or a more emotionally stirring shock of winterfell burning all that being said i thought it was one of the best episodes of the season and gave it a 9"

"protar",2012-06-07,"gave it a 6 it made for fairly entertaining tv but nothing special and im still getting frustrated at the changes from the books for no reason i did like the scene at the end but for the rest of the arcs there was little sense of climax mainlythe hotu was pretty atmospheric but dany learnt nothing from it in the books its a major pillar of her development she obsesses over what she sees and hears in there jason momoas sallary for that scene could probably have paid for some more visions and i cant see why they left out the three fires prophecyjons fight with qhorin lacked the emotion it had in the books due to them cutting their relationship in favour of more rose leslie and i dont think the reason for the fight was made clear enoughwinterfell has been amazing this season but in the finale it was botched bran and co emerging from the crypts didnt have the impact it should have due to the pointless earlier reveal that he was alive and all the heavy handed hinting before that the sacking of winterfell fell flat and would be confusing for nonreaders and ending theons arc with comedy was atrociousthose were the three main arc conclusions i didnt like the stuff at kl and robbs camp wasnt exactly climactic either but nor was it in the books and it wouldnt have needed to be if wed gotten some other climactic events in the episodealso despite being the longest episode this season it felt like one of the shortest wouldve been good if tywin had more than one line for instance instead we get more screentime for rosoverall a dissapointing season for book fans but with a small glimmer of hope for season 3 due to more episodes to adapt the story"

"OighearAgusTine",2012-06-08,"9really the only thing that stopped this from being a ten was the house of the undying but lets be honest theyve fucked dany up so much this season was anyone expecting anything less i even liked her walking out of the throne room to the other side of the wall considering thats where her real war will be but the way she was chained and killed pyat pree was justim convinced dd are part of the crew that hate dany and are trying as hard as they can to make the tv folk do the sameanyway on with the highs i loved stanniss scene and for anyone who says it was out of character just remember what we are told about his mind set during the first half of sos theons speech was great so was his anger for the horn blower i knew they were just going to let his men betray him so it didnt bother me that we didnt get to see the bastard of bolton not bastard never bastard you mustnt call him that the horse shitting made me laugh just because so many diehards on this board argued they wanted to see it the whole scene in the throne room was by the book so that was great i loved seeing the face change for a second i thought they wouldnt show it without little grandfather i didnt expect the stark boys to be split up so nothing there jons scene was rushed the who thing with him and the halfhand was dab im still pissed about ghost too i dont know why they already showed littlefinger as sanas savor but tv wise i guess it works tyrions scene with shae was emmy worthy his breakdown looked 100 real unlike his scarthey better make that look better next season not noseless i fully understand you cant do that but how about make it look like it wont fall from his face if he turns his head too fast i liked the look of the others better last season but if were going to be getting full views of them you kinda have to lay the makeup on a bit differently the cgi dead zombie folks looked great thoughas for the season as a whole id give it a strong eight where last years was a outstanding ten a clash of kings is a developing story and probably the weakest of the series but i was let down in someways regardless mainly because of dany who is my favorite in the book if they fuck her storm of swords story up like they did this yearboy are they in trouble she easily has the most interesting development in that storycouldnt agree more funnily enough  the story changes have been controversial among the lads i know but i try to remain indifferent form it especially if it works kindaand yes if they so much as even touch a hair on danys story in the 3rd book i will be super mad tonguepng classbbcemoticon altp "
"Areo Speedwagon",2012-06-08,"danys storyline in book 3 was great it contains one of if not my all time favorite moment after the transaction she rides up and down the ranks of the unsullied telling them they are hers as the slaver tries to yank drogon up the stairs and asks why he wont obey thats because hes not a slave dracarys oh my god that was amazing but i think the show took a lot of the punch out of that scene by having her basically do that in the hotu i like the whole hotu scene as a whole and as a non book reader would have loved the ending as well but knowing that scene in storm thats all i could think about anyway i think on the whole storm will be adapted far more faithfully than clash simply by them having 20 hours to tell the story not 10 so im confident everything that got pushed out of clash will be done justice in seasons 3 and 4 i also think feast will start to bleed into season 4 a bit i think the chronology of book to season will get real messy with season 4 certainly 5"

"drm7",2012-06-09,"anyway i think on the whole storm will be adapted far more faithfully than clash simply by them having 20 hours to tell the story not 10 so im confident everything that got pushed out of clash will be done justice in seasons 3 and 4 i also think feast will start to bleed into season 4 a bit i think the chronology of book to season will get real messy with season 4 certainly 5im pretty psyched that sos will be split because its such a big book and so much happens i think that feast and dance will be combined for the show as the timelines overlap it will be interesting to see how many show seasons they get out of feastdance given the imho large amount of downtime in feast lots of walking from place to place etc"
"ServantOnIce",2012-06-09,"whatd you thinkbest show on television along with boardwalk empire dexter and homeland   here1 i enjoyed the queen dany scenes they were good2 i liked the zombie apocalypse army at the end led by the white walkersothers3 i didnt like robbs wedding to gods he doesnt believe in   i thought they screwed the pooch with robb this year4 the winterfell destruction is a mystery as they have changed the reasons and causes for things on the show5 jons story was the weakest and the worst adapted this year but has potential for next season6 good to see kings landing and i loved shaes acting toward the end of the episode setting up for seasons 3 and 4 of storm of swordsfeast"

"SFA-OK",2012-06-10,"i have to say that i find it more entertaining to read the reviews on here than actually watching the episodes this season lol from fans giving the show a 10 and then listing a number of faults with the episode to fans of the book like myself that bitch about the overall hohum quality of the tv show good stuff i still havent watched the final episode not sure when that will be the shows overall approach and its writing is just too middle of the road and cliched i was hoping the writing would improve this season but i think its actually gotten worse in a lot of ways"

"Rhaegar Targaryen's Ghost",2012-07-16,"rated it a eight wasnt too bad glad that hotu was cut down as that was probably one of the worst scenes in cok the scene with dany in the throne room is very interestingit happens to be one of the top 5 most important scenes in any of the books its a glimpse into the future and it pretty much shows what will happen in the future shows the rw hints at rlj and shows a ton more"

"Dragon of Valyria",2012-06-03,"ugh im torn the hotu was a major disappointmentits not to say what they did wasnt goodbut those visions were pretty darned important they justified the whole qarth excursion which was otherwise pointless and seems pointless now yeah the dracarys was cool and the snowcovered throneroom is interesting but blah theon cointinues to be an idiot talisa and robb well tyrion and shae welll the margaery farce was entertaining there were several laugh out loud moments in my viewing party and it was enjoyable to see the palpable pleasure on sansas face if only for a moment"

"Meg Stark",2012-06-03,"i loved it i was worried that they would try to halfass the house of the undying due to budget issues i thought this was an even better way to do it subtly without having confusing or poorly done prophesy plus the people who are into prophecy are the ones who read the books anyway and i could never complain when khal drogo made an appearance i thought all the story lines wrapped up nicely i cannot wait to see the dynamics between joffrey and margery with those actors next season i i did get so sad when luwin died i had hoped that he was going to get a reprieve and finally that last scene was amazing not sure about the sam just sitting there issue but otherwise it was fantastic and terrifying i guess i didnt realize until seeing it on screen that the wights are basically zombies which is even more awesome white walkers scared the hell out of me cant wait till next season"
"Jolene Brown",2012-06-03,"im not even going to get into the whole robbcattalisa thing because thats probably the one thing im annoyed that they changed so muchsometimes i wish i could just meet them and ask why why why did they make these changes i dont think i could ever accept them but if i could even understand what on earth they were thinking it might help me feel less frustrated with other things that i dont like i sort of get it but with this i just can not comprehend their train of thought why mess with this storyline its not like there was this groundswell of fans that were like well i mostly like these books but i dont know about that whole red wedding thing i think it could be a little better i just dont understand"
"wotad",2012-06-03,"god you people want so much i loved the episode didnt read the books but you can say i wont get it etc i know they leave stuff out but its hard to add 56 people into 1 episode so i think this episode was the best i watch the show because i like danys story and it didnt let me down edited by wotad 03 june 2012  1125 pm"
"Lord Godric",2012-06-03,"oh and is dagmar supposed to be ramsey or is he just an annoyed ironborn who is trying to get safe passage home i think the latter right"
"Rockroi",2012-06-03,"danouement  what i likedall men must die this episode brought that finality after the climax after a long life has been lead maybe into a legend maybe a life of service maybe a handship we still all end up dead usually not by our own choosing i thought that this episode identified to the bitter end that some ends are more bitter than others jon snow 20 the battle with halfhand in the books is basically a passivevoice battle wherein events sort of happen to jon and jon never acts to do anything even the final swipe that kills halfhand in the books its almost described as if jon snow took no part in it but in that instant as he twisted the opening was there jon planted and pivoted the ranger was leaning away and for an instant it seemed that jon<U+0080><U+0099>s slash had not touched him then a string of red tears appeared across the big man<U+0080><U+0099>s throat bright as a ruby necklace and the blood gushed out of him and qhorin halfhand fell<U+0080><U+009D> martin george rr 20030101 a game of thronesa clash of kings kindle locations 2776727770 bantam kindle edition and besides ghost was the one who attacked halfhand firstbut in the show nope here jon is an active participant in the deed this jon snow actually takes some action he takes a stand and decides to embrace his roll and take a shot at this loved it i even enjoyed the way jon teased ygritte as she slashed at him and missed and then as he tells the truth <U+0080><U+009C><U+0080>first time you have ever held a sword huh<U+0080><U+009D> this jon snow is freed from the foolish chains that bound him in the books the reluctant hero nonsense i liked that with jon snow goes a man who is going to do his hard fought duty and as for halfhand all men must die few as cool as that no starks in winterfell although the destruction of winterfell must seem odd to the viewers who have not read the books the finality of these scenes were exceptional i thought bran and rickon<U+0080><U+0099>s escape and departure were very well done and beautiful the wolves the scenery of desolation the wreckage and obviously once again master luwin was amazing the pure and unalterable feeling of humanity and goodness from him how he touched both these boys reached out to them and sad that he knew every day of their lives from the first and counted himself lucky for that privilege that was truly touching deep and real all men must die but few as dignified as that and i loved that theon was crazy and the ngave this incredible speech  and then his men knocked him out because hes such a fucking idiot does stannis baratheon have to choke a bitch stannis is alive well and rip shit at first he takes it out on mel but then knows that is not <U+0080> just in the flames he sees <U+0080> something prophecy means nothing to him as he regrets deeply his killing of renly but in a whisper he hears that he will do things far far worse than that and stannis<U+0080>a king knows all men must die and stannis baratheon may be killing a few more of them soonthe edge of our sanity dany<U+0080><U+0099>s trip through the wreckages of her life and alternate lives from the throne she still wants to the husband and child she lost to the wall she must defend dany<U+0080><U+0099>s trip through worlds that would be and could be was phenomenal though<U+0080> a part of me thought <U+0080><U+009C>this could be done better<U+0080> no viserys rhaegar regardless what was actually done was great at least this part see more below all men must die especially creepy shits who can pull of mass assignations but seem to be confused on proper kidnappings varys and the whore holy shit we finally get to a roz scene that worked only twenty episodes in but it finally happened granted it took one of the best actors to pull it off but it worked huzzah for your troubles pyrcell<U+0080><U+0099>s small revenge was sweet but so is tyrion<U+0080><U+0099>s ever increasing knowledge that he is in quicksand varys gives him empty platitudes though maybe heart felt his father is nowhere to be found his guards gone his clansmen gone and the world suddenly outside his view and that little coin at the end a whore is a whore is a whore for your troubles<U+0080> classic and i almost could stomach shaes part of the scene almost the beginning of the end all men must die but some come back as wrights and others and try to invade the south amazing final scene what i am on the fence aboutbefore the new gods and the <U+0080> okay just  just the new gods the fact that when robb stark the king in the north mind you marries a woman from another continent he swears it only by the new gods it was an unfortunate allegory to how cheaply tacked on and phony this story line finished its not that he did not say anything about the old gods that<U+0080><U+0099>s just a symptom it<U+0080><U+0099>s the fact that robb stark does this incredibly stupid thing with his mother standing there in her tent and does so with full knowledge of how fucking stupid he is being he knows he<U+0080><U+0099>s being an ass he knows he is screwing the frey<U+0080><U+0099>s and he just does it in the books robb could say <U+0080><U+009C>i needed to make an honest woman out of her<U+0080><U+009D> in the show in the show robb has no protection he really is just a stupid irresponsible oathbreaker he does everything with real contemplation that was always my fear once cat came back and robb was still there that his choice to toss the freys aside would not have that same dimension it did in the books in the books robb was <U+0080><U+009C>rash<U+0080><U+009D> <U+0080><U+009C>impulsive<U+0080><U+009D> and <U+0080><U+009C>young<U+0080><U+009D> but in the show now robb is not <U+0080><U+009C>rash<U+0080><U+009D> but <U+0080><U+009C>foolish<U+0080><U+009D> not <U+0080><U+009C>impulsive<U+0080><U+009D> but <U+0080><U+009C>idiotic<U+0080><U+009D> and no longer <U+0080><U+009C>young<U+0080><U+009D> but <U+0080><U+009C>immature<U+0080><U+009D> he wants everything now now now now now now you know how bad that was in the scene where robb was talking to cat <U+0080><U+0093> if you go back and read the scene just take the dialog robb does not sound like robb he sounds like <U+0080> joff skipping book three so the brienne scene total waste of time what happened what did we need to see here brienne got angry and killed a few guys we knew she could kill people already brienne showed that she does not like needless suffering we knew that already as well jaime showed that he did not want to be captured well we really knew that already what the fuck was this scene for the actual answer is <U+0080><U+009C>the actors have agents and demand screen time<U+0080><U+009D> it was a complete waste of time i mean here is what the scene was travelling with brienne seeing the aftereffects of a war seeing cruelty and most everything we saw could have been skippeda complete waste of time in other words they are not just starting early on <U+0080><U+009C>a storm of swords<U+0080><U+009D> the show is jumping right into the epic monotony of <U+0080><U+009C>a feast for crows<U+0080><U+009D> what i did not like empty i liked that she corrected doreah on how to pronounce qarth i liked that she caught doreah and the rest of dany<U+0080><U+0099>s storyline was utterly vacant and empty void of thought void of meaning void of connectivity to the rest of the storylook it was not going to be as interesting as the books i got that but this felt tacked on halfthought out and not well balanced against the rest of the story dany<U+0080><U+0099>s story was a storyline of halfmeasures that took twice as long as it needed to it was no fun and utterly anticlimactic she starts yelling in the very first scene and then its wandering around then she gets trapped and we get the <U+0080><U+009C>drogon dracarys<U+0080><U+009D><U+0080> and its <U+0080> bad they shoot fire who cares that just means pratt prye et all had a fucking terrible plan you know they<U+0080><U+0099>re dragons right you think maybe they know how to shoot fire in the books drogon dracarys is the most amazing scene in the series possible here a really really shitty escape hatch but it gets worse dany and her people who seem to fluctuate in number between <U+0080><U+009C>three<U+0080><U+009D> to as high as <U+0080><U+009C>able to break into the king of qarth<U+0080><U+0099>s castle kill everyone and get into the king<U+0080><U+0099>s bed chamber without waking him up<U+0080><U+009D> <U+0080><U+0093> take the king and doreah to the vault where its empty ohhh<U+0080> edgy and throw them in terrific they then ransack the place and remember these are less people than dany had when she failed to protect the dragons the first time and we waited four episodes <U+0080> for that for dany to open and empty vault if that<U+0080><U+0099>s not a metaphor for dany<U+0080><U+0099>s story line in this season i<U+0080><U+0099>m not sure what is clash of kings is pretty void of dany and the show did not have much to work with but they wasted so much time and space on qarth on political maneuverings we did not care about with plots that had more holes in them then a sieve with characters we had no chance to care about all of that was empty vapid selfish and utterly wasted in retrospect you could have made dany trapped in the house of the undying for two episodes and just done a better job of it instead we got a fastforward house that had nothing to it except what i noted in the scenes i liked and a plot against dany that had no substance or reality to it simply put fail overall though the episode was pretty good not great however it did what it needed to do without making it feel rushed overall this season was uneven but ultimately very satisfying it started off with good building blocks and gave us a lot to see interact with and enjoy from robb and jaime to stannis v tyrion it was a really enjoyable season that did all the things it needed to do and gave us a few moments of real flair and and drama there were slow points <U+0080><U+0093> ultimately robb<U+0080><U+0099>s love problem appears to have been too much <U+0080><U+009C>love<U+0080><U+009D> and not enough <U+0080><U+009C>problem<U+0080><U+009D> in robb<U+0080><U+0099>s mind dany<U+0080><U+0099>s journey was not just unfulfilling but took away too much time from the rest of the story but it had a series of amazing moments and maybe the best episode in the show<U+0080><U+0099>s short life blackwater i am really looking forward to the next season again and to all those who explain how much they enjoy my posts either through comments or the <U+0080><U+009C>like<U+0080><U+009D> button i really truly appreciate it thanks for reading"

"Tarandor",2012-06-03,"the house of the undying was a bit of a let down but i did enjoy the scene with drogo and rhaego very sad i also enjoyed how they got the ominous feeling down right even the vision of the red keep in ruins was good but lacking the other visions was disappointing some book scenes just cannot be translated onto the screen and this was one of them it still got the point across though i loved how they allowed dany to be badass in the end and lock xaro and doreah in the vault yay khaleesiim glad they kept the little touch of tywins horse pooping in the throne room niceim not a big crierat all but i must admit i got teary eyed when tyrion started bawling i really truly do love this character and peter dinklage really is a revelation in the rolethe end scene with the others and their armies of the undead was fantastic and made up for the disappointing hotu scene loved how the ended last scene with fire and now they end this one with iceapril 2013 cannot come soon enoughoh my gods right it was heartbreaking to watch him bawl like that peter dinklage is just fantastic"
"Lord Godric",2012-06-03,"now that the season is over i realize that i have one major gripe with the series both seasons but first a disclaimer i am by no means a purist i except changes and understand the differences in the mediums call for differences in the stories and i love seeing the added scenes because it is like extra scenes we didnt see from the books but with that said my major gripe is that theyre cutting all the backstory and i understand how hard it is to fit backstory into the show but and i noticed it especially in the house of the undying i really wanted to see elia and rhaegar and have some mention of the prince that was promised i was hoping in that giant wall scene to see some blue flower among the ice but then i realized we never were told anything about lyanna and blue flowers so it wouldnt have been meaningful at all i miss that stuff in the series but i guess thats why i have the books"
"Jovet",2012-06-03,"that end scene with theon was a bit surprising to me it almost struck me that the guy who has been egging him on was maybe really the bastard in disguise after all he suddenly got very authoritative and then they put theons head in a sack will be a long wait to see what really happens with that in season 3"
"Ser Joe of House Targaryen",2012-06-03,"i liked most of this episode the hotu scene was really different from the books and im ok with that if they had done a word for word adaptation viewers who havent read the books wouldve been left too confused i thought we were going to see aerys though what happened to the actor who was cast as the mad king for this episode hopefully that will be on the bluray the scene where the stark kids find luwin was just heart wrenching as always all the tyrion stuff was just awesome loved jon snow and his reaction to the wildling camp just how much they showed of the wights and the other was shocking but they made sam too much of a craven watching it for the 3rd time now and overall i like it the show and the book are separate for me and i love them both for what they are"
"Tetrarch42",2012-06-03,"i really disliked stannis characterization i always saw him as stoic brooding and irritable not a man who flies into rages and strangles others on a whim it seems almost like the different screenwriters are interpreting his chracacter completely differently he went from a determined just and somewhat depresseddour commander in episode 8 to a reckless action hero in episode 9 and now hes a tempermental domestic abuser pick your key chracteristics and stick with them until theres adequate explanation for a personality change stannis seems like hed be diagnosed with dissociative personality disorder at this point pretty upsetting that theyve reduced my favourite character to a mercurial bully other than that i was pretty satisfied with the episode would have been cool to see arya kill someone but the ending more than made up for that and a note on the ending they really changed the white walker style they went from black and shadowy to pale with hair are we dealing with different types of white walkers or entities all together"

"pinkie10",2012-06-03,"this episode proved one thing for sure varys is definitely a eunuch there have been theories that say he is not truly cut but now we know he most certainly is in the show at least also i didnt like how luwin didnt tell osha to split the boys up that seemed important to me i can picture them running into the reeds in the first episode and they will recommend the split rickon must go to skagos and become even more fierce and the one thing that is crazy to me is the fact that brienne is just straight up killing everyone shes already killed 5 guys so far but in the books when she is forced to actually kill her first men its a giant deal and it happens way later she doesnt willingly just kill a ton of people did like the episode on the whole though its just easier to come on here and complain rather than name all of the things i liked i like the final scene even though i never really pictured zombies i guess i dont know what i pictured but it wasnt that i like it and i like that ill have a nice visual on my reread of the series in the next 10 months i thought the hotu was fine granted we didnt see anything us bookiesnerdies wanted to see but i liked the sacked throne room a vision that maybe suggest dany will be taking that shizz over possibly"
"Jovet",2012-06-03,"i actually liked the scene with brienne and jaime the point of it was jamie got to see what she was made of i thought it was great when she let loose and i know im a guy but the look on that third guys face the whole time she was stabbing him in the groin was absolutely award winning i also generally liked jons scenes and storyline it didnt seem to be told as well as it could have and i never grasped a real thought process of why a guy on the inside is suddenly a great idea but overall it didnt bother me the marriage ceremony with the new gods surprised me i would like to think there was some sort of subtle rationale for it but i bet it was just a writing error i was not touched by tyrions teary eyes every sentimental moment with shae hes been doing that and i just dont see that his character would be doing that his first marriage left him bitter and cold and detatched and i have great difficulty believing that hed let himself feel that strongly for someone again it makes sense he cares about shae but there is a limit i also note the irony that the one person who really seems devoted to him shae is the one he tries to push away everyone else he has proclaimed his friendship with has kindof rolled their eyes at him  okay whatever to me what happens with her and tywin is ambigous in the booksit will be very interesting to me to see how the show handles that except for danys scenes especially in the house of the undying i liked the episode but i still think it was the poorest of the second season overall the show is awesome and i cant beg hbo enough to keep it up im really looking forward to next year and hopefully several years after that"

"Ffiferoo",2012-06-04,"im very confused by a lot of the choices that were made plotwise this season that culminated with this episode there were several things jons storyline especially that i was expecting would get back on track once they set up for that to happen but it seems like they got a lot of characters where they needed to be to follow their actual plots and then went ahead and deviated anyway i can understand when changes are made for time or clarity or budget reasons but i think there were some decisions made this season that could set up some very drastic changes later on as far as the house of the undying it was something i knew wouldnt be exactly the same and i thought the temptationsvisions they did give were good and made sense in the context of the show but i wish theyd given a little more exposition and they really could have just put those things through open doors and kept the instructions from pyat pree about the door on the right etc he could have spoken to her without appearing physically until later aside from that and the lack of qhorinjon interaction im also quite upset that irri was killed off this season  i thought they had just decided to keep doreah instead but if shes dead now it feels like irri was killed arbitrarily and its a real shame because amrita acharia was really excellent i liked the briennejaime scene even just as a brief checkin before the end of the season i hope jaime will start to call her wench next season sophie turner did a great job reacting to joffrey breaking the betrothal im really impressed with all of her performances this season seeing all the white walkers on their way to the fist was great too although i dont know how sam is going to magically survive being completely surrounded like that sam the very prolific slayer overall im left with a disappointed feeling although maybe on a second viewing i can appreciate it more"
"Bran the Bummer",2012-06-04,"i think theyll end up working the prophecies into quaithes storyline very early next season i dont see dany being able to go forward with much direction without them and since the house of the undying was such a blow they might use her  except shes never really interacted with dany so who knows"
"Grendel Khan",2012-06-04,"just got done with the second watcnh of the finale gotta say that overall i really liked this ep like alot of people i was initially let down by hotu but the more i think about it the more i like what they did the iron throne room scene was very cool and awfully foreboding the drogo comeback was a nice touch kind of cool to see the mental prison being built by the warlocks to trap dany although iwas kind of looking forward to seeing how they could pull off the floating heart and vampireghostmummies on the screen seeing the dragons cut loose and torch pyat and his clones was sweeeeeeet cant wait to see them little cuties toasting astapor bring on the unsullied the john and qhorin fight could have been set up better at least they could have had qhorin ordering him to do whatever was asked of him to set up the emotional conflict john fights in sos but it was a good brawl between two good swordsmen fun to watch if nothing else really liked the luwin and theon convo really sad about luwin getting shive even though i was ready for it how funny was theons hate for the hornblower a bronze statue awesome wish they could have shown what happened with the bastard sacking winterfell though my gf who has not read the books was just confused as shit as to why winterfell was torched after dagmer and co sold out theon jaqen haqar is the man that is all loved the ending the walkers and the wights coming out of the snow and marching on the fist was a hell of a way to end the season was a little weird for sammy to get ignored by them all but i guess the director wanted to be able to show a human point of view seeing the walkers stomping in i thought it conveyed a great sense of impending doom not just for the watch but for all of westeros with all the political shenanigans its easy to forget the real threat thats out there the only thing im really disappointed with is the noshow of arstan the bold and strong belwas thought they might pop up after dany locked up daxos but oh well ill just have to wait for next season and what a long wait its going to be bloody mummers salve revolts two epic weddings coldhands mag the mighty it cant come fast enough"

"J_Crews",2012-06-04,"a few thoughts as i rewatch tonights finale apologies if a hundred people have touched on these before me but the board wont stay up long enough for me to post these in realtime ill be copypasting later  pycelle was deliciously satisfied with tyrions downfall  loved sansas reaction to being set aside  littlefinger being awfully open about helping sansa why was dontos introduced at all i wonder  loving brienne she straight fd that dude up  dillane is wickedly intense as stannis  alfie allen deserves an emmy him being so intense while simultaneously bitching about the hornblower was hilarious and a very nice touch i thought allens portrayal has actually manges to humanize theonfreakinggreyjoy for me  no knighthood for ser bronn of the blackwater  bran riding in the westerosi equivalent of a grocery cart har smilepng classbbcemoticon alt   the hotu was sufficiently weird for my tastes i loved the sequence of how dany entered i imagine many people are freaking about the different visions and no mention of the 3 prophecies but i wasnt expecting much so im not disappointed seeing drogo and the ruined throne room was cool tying the wall in was a nice touch and there will be plenty of time to introduce the prophecies later by quaithe maybe far too early for rhaegar visions and such explicit foreshadowing of the rw in my opinion  a man changes his face and sufficiently lays the groundwork for a girls future storyline good  jon killing qh was a little off i think it would have benefited from one more snippet of a conversation with qh being clear about his orders true there was the previous interaction with qh talking about jon being able to do what he must when the time comes i just hope it wasnt lost on casual viewers  rip my beautiful doreah sigh closing them up in the vault and pillaging xaros whiznit was a cool ending for dany  3 blasts and that other was awesome i was a bit surprised we didnt see any sam the slayer action but only because some comments in a recent interview with the actor who plays him made it seem that way"
"Tewks44",2012-06-04,"i gotta say i am hugely disappointed about a handful of things 1 the way they handled jon snows betrayal of quhorin halfhand was awful jon was originally written as a noble figure a good guy who only betrayed his sworn brethren because he was ordered to as a selfless act on quhorins behalf in the show he got butthurt because quhorin talked smack about his mom so he stabbed him in the heart killing him instantly cool 2 sure they recast xaro xohan daxos as a bad guy but come on even a bad guy wont build the most indestructible safe in the world to protect absolutely nothing i mean they could have just as easily rewritten that scene so dany and her retinue loots xaros safe to get their money instead they were like well herp derp xaro built this safe for no comprehensible reason whatsoever oh well lets steal everything from qarth because its not like there any guardsmen around its bs just because the creepy magician and xaro are dead doesnt mean the entire force of city guard in qarth disappeared in a matter of hours its absurd to suggest her 50 something troop could loot the entire palace without any contest at all 3 the sacking of winterfell who sacked the city in the books it was ramsey in the show well who knows i think maester luwin should have at least said something about ramsey i understand due to casting issues we probably wouldnt see ramsey this season because why would hbo want to get an actor on retainer for such a long period of time but its free for hbo to mention him all it would have taked is for maester luwin to say no this wasnt theon it was the bastard of the dreadfort other than that i actually enjoyed the other story lines i love how we got to see jaquen hagar switch faces and i thought the house of the undying scene was cool despite the changes the fact dany entered a throne room filled with snow and then exited through the gates of the wall very cool especially for all you rlj fans"

"Tewks44",2012-06-04,"now i understand why grrm only dealt with the battle of blackwater in his episodes and no other storylines the writers of the show have already diverged the other story lines so far from the books theres little use in grrm standing in to do the writing for them"
"valarya",2012-06-04,"i dawwed at the part where rickon and bran frantically offered to heal luwin so sad but cute hotu was a definite letdown im not sure if those scenes were slight hints at whats to come in the books is drogo supposed to come back a snowcovered red keep  dragon attack on kings landing that results in jon or some other stark ruling or maybe the others win the final battle no idea"

"Howdyphillip",2012-06-04,"i thought that taken as a whole this was a great season there were also a lot to love in this episode as well the dragon fire was absolutely amazing and it was nice to see brienne kicking ass as well the relationship between shae and tyrion has grown even more complex and enjoyable than even the books at this point and i personally liked the addition of jason mamoa even though it was vastly different than what happened in the books i would like to have seen glimpses of other visions though i finally found a scream out loud and flip over a table moment though and it was robs wedding there is plausible explanations for almost every faux paux and mistake in the writing up to this point but to set a wedding scene and not know what gods either of the characters in the scene worship is just blatantly lazy i dont understand how this was let through i am watching the show with a bunch of the unsullied and i had to pause it to go on a rant twins horse shitting in the throne room was a perfect shot and sophie turner and natalie dormir did amazing jobs as the betrothed girls with jackie gleeson again playing an impeccable little shit allen alfie was incredible i also think they show just as the books gave the possibility of luwin being still alive hooded man in winterfell anyone"
"summer_stark",2012-06-04,"too much to read through and im too tiredsomy thoughts 1 where is ghost i know i harp on this every week but it literally makes no sense in the story that there is no ghost  it makes sense budget wise since how do you make a cgi dw attack someone realistically but to not have him there at all i just dont understand it 2 hotu  this was ok for me i didnt think that drogo scene was amazing honestly  but the rest was fine i am actually in the minority of people who are glad they didnt visualize the prophecies  i had been hoping they wouldnt because some shit wouldve been way too obvious  a wolf head on a guy dead at a wedding hello super telegraphing i mean granted theyre already telegraphing a bit with the whole cant betray a frey thing and newbies seem to think hell die for it but im glad they arent totally spoiling it is mainly how i feel about it when she went to the wall though i thought wed see a blue flower otherwise that was random 3 jaqen aryaawesomeness although the new guymakeup i think it was a new guy cos the voice was different made me sad bc i love tom w you will be missedmaybe he can wear jaqenface whenver we see him killing people in the series 4 winterfell  i liked that whole sequence they will bring in ramsay and some people are already predicting that thats what happened  granted they werent going to be able to show the razing wo the whole subplot which was a bummer but im glad we get our reek and ramsay cried when luwin died after talking to the boyscouldnt help it even though i knew it was coming i sort of got on the maybe theyll keep him alive bandwagon after no reeds but then once they were confirmed for season 3 i figured hed die  so as soon as he walked out after dagmer hit theon over the head i thought there goes luwinbut still cried nice work got 5 north of the wall  i think they fucked this up way worse than danys storyline my newbie friends had no idea that qhorin egged jon on to kill him to become a double agent  they just thought qhorin suddenly hated jon and tried to kill him such a totally unnecessary way to do it  of all the things they make blatant to make this one subtle seemed like a huge mistake  some newbie reviews think jon is now free from the nights watch and wonder what hell do next that is just a failure of the team and it makes no sense whatsoever the amount of time and money it wouldve taken to clear this up is very minor  compared to how fucked up this makes jon look and how people will always wonder whether he is a double agent or just an opportunist  he leaves the nw to join teh wildlings when thats the only way then joins the nw again  maybe at that point it will make more sense that he was a double agent but i dunno  it just seems too random i dont understand why they did it that way and now i really wonder whether ghost is ever coming back is it just bc they were up in the mountains and  ghost couldnt follow as long as he comes back i dont care what their reasoning is i presume he will come back but what if he doesnt i cant see that happening i mean i can but i will be super bummed ghost is literally my 3rd favorite character in the whole damn series which i know is very weird 7 the white walkers looked so bad i cringed super bummed i liked the weird black ones way better  they looked way more mysterious and cloaked and creepy these reminded me of like a skeletor zombie and agree that it makes no sense not to kill sam immediately and theres no way sam is getting out of there wo some absurdly contrived storyline what he kills the horsed white walker and the wights are just like ok nevermind were out 8 i didnt love tyrionshaes scene  i loved how now the whole theyre in love story is now very clear and will be very painful but something about it was  off maybe its just the fact that i know her feelings and i cant watch tyrion love her instead of it being a problem wpeter and sybill s chemistry 9 the doreah betrayal was a cool surprise and i liked how they are starting to make dany ruthless and fucked upand regardless of how terrible doreahs betrayal was  locking her in an empty vault wone other person who will likely eat her bf he dies of starvationdehydration  was just another level of fuckeduppedness that is totally the dany i have come to dislike 10 brienne was bamf and the scene with them trying to pass jaime off was hilarious and then the dude asking them to count to 3 and then say his name at the same time was friggin genius also the whole if id known i was jaime lannister i wouldnt have had to steal that pig bit was awesome so if i added it up kl 1 winterfell 5 with extra points to theons hilarious diatribe about the horns and luwins death scene and bc at least bran and rickons direwolves still exist hotu 1 north of the wall 10 stannis 1 robbtalisa 0 jaqenarya  5 jaimebrienne 4 all in all a pretty mixed bag edited by summerstark 04 june 2012  0241 am"

"Lord of the Night",2012-06-04,"my thoughts on the game of thrones finale valar morghulis awesome title arya and jaqen spoiler its no secret that i have disliked aryas story immensely this season for altering everything that makes it compelling and for removing roose bolton and the bloody mummers her final scene with jaqen was great but doesnt make up for the poor handling of her story her actress is great and i have no doubt she would have pulled off the true story greatly but now well never know that said jaqens face change was awesome jon and qhorinsam and the army spoiler decent enough i suppose though the show does not have the deeper relationship between jon and qhorin and frankly i found it a bit dull sam and the army of the dead was much more entertaining even if its completely new hard to believe that they wouldnt just gut him and the white walkers look nothing like they do in the books daenerys spoiler boring and terrible the entire qarth storyline was mangled by pyat pree and xaros coup the theft of the dragons and the house of the undying scene was completely ruined and crappy compared to the books where the hell was the hallucination of aerys of rhaegar and the song of ice and fire the visions of the future and past and the three prophecies just plain awful and i dearly hope that they get daenerys back on track for season 3 which is her best storyline tyrion spoiler as usual peter dinklage is the king of the show and nails everything i sometimes think his scenes get more attention from the writers and producers than the others do no complaints only praise stannis spoiler stannis this season was a mixed bag i do like his actor but he needs to find that core of iron that stannis has in the books the man who will break before he bends and he should put a more commanding tone in his voice theon and winterfell spoiler what the fuck was that dagmer cleftjaw burns winterfell no no no no no ramsay bolton burns winterfell and enslaves its women i do not know what the hell made them think ramsay bolton is a superfluous character this season because he isnt he is critical and because of that the entire winterfell plot with theon lacked tension the true character study of theon as he listens more and more to reek and the final climactic scene when ramsay burns winterfell and takes him hostage was epic in the books and now we dont get to see it yet another awesome scene taken away robb and talisa spoiler i do not like the talisa changes i do not think that jeyne westerling and tywin lannisters plot with her mother to ruin robb is too complex for audiences i think that it is patronizing to think that we cannot understand the lannisters prime general setting up a meeting between a young enemy king and a beautiful woman which can only end in one way really on the whole a very mixed finale to a mixed season i really hope they get on the ball the asoiaf ball for season 3 and do not change anything further too many changes are already in play and i like none of them lotn"

"AegonTheUnlikely",2012-06-04,"let me start off by being contrary i loved this episode further i loved this season finished my 3rd read of the series before the season started fwiw i think it was a solid season and worked well byandlarge some changes i wasnt wild about others i thought were nice ways to cut through some of the density of the story i know the density is part of what makes the story so good its true but dense doesnt work so well visually how many people sat through all 8 or however many hours of gods  generals i watched a bit well done it seemed but dense for instance i know there are issues taken with aryas story line this was a set of changes i think worked to be honest the first time i read clash the change in ownership of harrenhal confused the hell out of me it would have been worse on screen more without roose or any of the other activity in the riverlands and no bloody mummers key elements to that plot are missing we couldnt get the mummers or the tullys and the riverlands stuff probably because 1 they already had to introduce stannis et al the tyrells greyjoys etc and 2 they spent all the money on blackwater thus i think the changes made to aryas storyline were a good way to getting people where they need to be in a fashion consistent with the tone of the story with some good bits to keep it entertaining along the way why didnt she name tywin because shes a kid and kids make poor decisions some times the other option would have been some seriously compromised version of the books change of ownershipweasel soup plot danys plot worked less well in my opinion i dont really care that the 13 is essentially an amalgam of the various qartheen factions actually i thought that to be a rater clever simplification the stolen dragon plot annoyed me a bit beause of how dany reacts i rather enjoyed the hotu though i thought it worked you werent ever going to get the visions she had in the book as others have said they are very literal moments of foreshadowing seeing a corpse with a wolf head sitting on a throne would give away the game re robb stark likewise with no lyanna backstory and really no established basis for the various prophecies the blue flower and rhaegarelia scenes wouldnt make much sense they wouldnt be giving the viewer any important information they would be creating questions look for the prophecy to be delivered another way by quaithe most likely imo i actually cant help but chuckle at many of the complaints about this seasonepisode no offense meant towards those voicing the opinions and to be fair there are a number of legitimate criticisms of the show i liked the other i thought he looked like he was made of ice the army of wights was pretty imposing also particularly when the camera does the final pullback to those complaining it was like the walking dead  how else did you think an army of clumsy brainless reanimated corpses was going to come across"
"legba11",2012-06-04,"ugh the forums ate my initial reactions 810 great episode with a few flaws kings landing the throne room and tyrion scenes were excellent minus the horse crap hbo moment do we really need cheap tricks the rosvarys not a ros hater here scene was really unnecessary in an episode where almost everything was rushed robbcatelyn was both unnecessary and rushed hard to do either have the scene or dont have it it makes you wonder why we needed 73 meaningless stories about robb and notjeynes childhoods and couldnt find time for this scene to be done properly i did enjoy the fake out marriage i cant imagine the purist heads exploding when people thought it was tyrion and shae arya very nice finale for jaquen i dont understand leaving out her coldblooded murder as i see that as her point of no return winterfell perfect in every way i love the mysterious destruction of winterfell i had hopes that luwin would survive as watching he and osha argue over brans path would make the upcoming seasons of his pointless stories more fun to watch yes i know that isnt a popular opinion but i find bran to be a pointless character after book 2 i am hoping martin makes me care about his chapters again this isnt to say that they are all bad his conflict with jon and team wildling was excellent stannis a nice conclusion but i felt cheated not getting a quick glimpse into the fire is davos really dead i would have thought they would have mentioned him in some way if they were making it a cliffhanger jon what they had was excellent but this scene needed twice the time to play out im sure glad we had ros grabbing varys crotch and a horse taking a shit instead of more time here i like that they didnt beat you over the head with quorins ploy is there some character missing here someone furry i cant remember jons merry men i loved this conclusion in a season where the twist is the only important character to die was renly midseason what were the vegas odds on everyone surviving blackwater except maybe davos who is second tier in the show"

"StannisandDaeny",2012-06-04,"ok takes a deep breathebad this episode clearly suffered for having to cramp too much stuff in my biggest complaint of all ramsay didnt totally betray everyone the ironborn burned down winterfell yeah apparently they did cos luwin didnt say anything about northerners being guilty the northerners are absent for no reason god damnit that was horrible one of the best most desperate and dramatic scenes in the book totally ruined what happened at winterfell is pivotal to what happens in the north later cos when it is revealed it will bring ramsay down manderly will have no one to tell him of it save the ironborn who he cant get his hands on theres tons of ironborn survivors seriously now what how is manderly going to know bran and rickon are alive and spare davos and send davos on his task is he going to capture all the ironborn if the ironborn got away on time and didnt burn winterfell how will they be able to tell what happened see this is what happens is you dont do things properly youre just creating a domino effect luwins death scene started out perfectly but ended horribly it was an emotional buildup but then it just didnt deliver maybe its the acting maybe its the writing im not too sure theyll have a hard time bringing dagmer back in some role in which he aids asha and theon later which i think he eventually will the scene with ros and varys was completely pointless guess they needed at least someone to show her boobs if only briefly the writers fucking with us shae asking tyrion to go with her and jaqen asking arya to go with him serves no purpose but to make us readers creep to the edge of our seat and go oh no you wont shae gets more irritating with every passing episode i very much grant jason momoa his scene and wish all the best for him his scene was however quite pointless and seemed to be written to serve little more purpose than making some fangirls go squee theyre kiling off all of daenys handmaidens presumably to cut costs all the hottest chicks disappear from the show noooo the king of qarth the richest man in the greatest city to have ever been and that will ever be has no guards you can just barge in there and kill him if you want to that makes no sense pyat pree was beaten far too easily he was the only warlock apparently and they didnt even have to burn the hotu to escape him lame apparently he has a ton of guys ready to cut the thirteens throats destroy a little khalasar without casualties and steal dragons and can survive being run through with a sword but three small dragons are too much for him and he gets mysteriously killed without any of his weird helpers even remotely near him no cool visions none at all sobs the members of daenys khalasar mysteriously revived okay then huzzah jons scene with qorin is tfu oh youre the man who killed the halfhand well thats not going to win you much respect if the wildlings had already captured him and could have just slit his throat at any time innit on top of that no ones going to understand why qorin did what he did they tried to make it clear and failed not going to punch the nonreaders if they didnt get this on the contrary in the first episode the wights are running like hell here they are a bunch of stumbling corpses i dont mind either portrayal but it has to be consistent and its not stannis stannis stannis stannis when im not putting exclamation points behind his name you know somethings wrong i have nothing against dillane but whats with that dialogue you will betray everyone everyone yeah youll betray everyone no he wont what the hell are they setting him up for the other looks like a urukhai who has spent too much time in the freezer and had no armour others are elegant humanoids with coollooking armour and swords they have an alien feel to them instead of a hideous monster feel and while i wouldnt call them beautiful they are not as hideous as this thing either the other completely lacked the magical look others have sorry but the other looked like a crappy creature from a b horror movie and this is terrible because now this has been established as the look for the other therell be no turning back no matter how scary he was i feel the strong urge to pull him out of the screen and beat him up even though it would probably kill me  it made no sense that the other would ignore and thus spare samslightly redeeming ros has lost some weight again during her time offscreen yum tywins horse crapping they kept the bald dude as an interesting extra for future ironborn scenes kinda like that guy hes everything i pictured the ironborn to be theon being beat down was funny if anything the other did look sufficiently scary even though everything else about him suckedgood the tyrells are shown to be opportunistic bastards and margaery as pretty much a whore i like tyrion waking up with the smug pycelle was good thank you peter dinklage for delivering some quality arya  jaqen scene was overall good in fact i loved that scene i think they gave people who had been salivating all over him a bit of a scare when the face changed it sure scared me petyrs talk with sansa was good makes people again wonder whats his game how is he going about things hey wasnt this guy evil isnt he going to f sansa over just gives a lot to look forward to in general house of the undying it looked nice and thats all i have to say about it brienne being badass i kinda felt myself sitting with my legs crossed when she killed that final guy even though i shouldnt have anything to fear im not a rapist or a

"Fez",2012-06-04,"really not sure how i feel about this episode there were parts that i really liked arya all the kings landing stuff theons scenes brienne and jamie dany posthotu but at the same time i had some serious problems as well first was the absolute lack of explanation for too much stuff jon and halfhands fight wasnt properly set up and there was absolutely no explanation for the burning of winterfell sure we know ramsay did it but in terms of showonly its just confusing and then theres robbs marriage i dont think it was properly set up either and considering the aging up from the books i dont think the suddenness makes much sense at least not without better explanation also why was it in front of the seven second was the hotu ive always said im fine with changes and id be fine with changes here i just dont much care for the changes they made it was cool seeing drogo again and completely surprised me so that was neat but i wanted more stuff just seeing a ruined throne room and then the wall before happy family time wasnt interesting enough and moved too slowly again i dont need dany to see all the david lynchian visions from the book but i wanted something a bit more substantive third was the white walkersothers the wights look great like the cast of the walking dead invaded the set but the wwothers themselves just look goofy although their swords and undead horses do look good considering how great the rest of the cgi has been seriously those dragons are amazing im rather disappointed particularly since this was the final image of the season now all that being said there was certainly plenty to enjoy about the episode as well and i really liked how much it jumped around this week and how overwhelming it sort of was it acted as reminder to people yes we really do have this much plot going on right now dare you to keep up that was fun also the face changing and tywins horse shitting were really well done eta oh and this week further confirmed that im an even bigger fan of show stannis than book stannis stephen dillane is so great i cant wait until his endofasos and onward plot begins edited by fez 04 june 2012  1012 am"

"Sunweaver",2012-06-04,"this episode waswell i guess it wasnt terrible what with the briennejaime theonluwin aryajaqen and kings landing scenes in general except rozvaris but seriously they made a lot of pointless changes while the drogo scene was pretty touching it is irritating to have all these other visions that we all were really looking forward to replaced with mostly meaningless fluff i didnt care about the wedding mostly because i have already given up on robbs storyline jon fighting qhorin was way to contrived if they hadnt completely changed the entire storycontext just to give ygritte developement she would have had in the third book anyway this wouldnt have seemed so silly to me but the worst part for me was how they just left out ramseysthe boltons betrayal i mean that was a really important moment it informed us of the boltons inherent treachery and gave us an idea of ramsays cruelty i realize that you cant get everything into a 50 minutes episode but seriously if they had just cut out roz and fill in ramseys betrayal i would have been much happier with this episode by the way where is the others hatred for everything living apparently sam isnt worth their attention"

"Leuf",2012-06-04,"i loved this episode so robb got married by the seven its the first time theyve actually said all the names on the show so they worked in some exposition there get over it the cgi was great they couldnt have screwed up qhorinjon because even larry williams understood what was going on and larry is pretty dense danys trip to the hotu people are so busy whining about what wasnt there they completely miss what was there was that ash or snow falling on the iron throne or should i say was that jon snow on the iron throne just to make it more obvious for you dany also had to turn away from the iron throne and drogo being there was really great that stuff was a lot more important than you must always take the first right and other random stuff the only things that bothered me were they continue to fuck up littlefinger and his story in every way possible and they refuse to take any opportunity to write ros out of the show"

"pleonasm",2012-06-04,"this was the worst episode of the series bar none the cliffhanger with the wights and white walkers was dreadful a complete of lack of threat menace or tension just compare it to the introduction of the white walker in the pilot this was laughable other than the throne sequence the house of undying had a complete lack of imagination there was a thousand different ways they could have approached this something sinister something weird ala the black lodge from twin peaks something heartbreaking many of them low cost but this failed at every level no mystery pointless really failing to leverage the huge bag of tricks available in a visual medium what did we get a tent a baby with a bad wig and jason momoa and time isnt an excuse danny had nothing to do all freaking season  this should have a 1015 minute  what the fuck type of moment"
"BlueQueen",2012-06-04,"i liked it overall but i am curious what varys wants with ros also as far as the wedding it bothered me that they were married by a septon but i think that having them say the vows sets up the general guidelines for weddings and so next season with the first wedding tyrion and sansa the viewer will be familiar with the vows and will see the contrast between happy wedding robb and talisa and sad wedding tyrion and sansa anyone else see the treatment of doreah and shae as a bit of foreshadowing i think that shae is going to end up in cerseis service maybe she is already after all a lot had changed since tyrion got wounded as he finds out her plea to run to pentos could be an attempt to also get herself out of spying on him with doreah we see that she was pushed to help xaro because she thought that dany was doomed she is a whore trying to survive much like shae we also saw the consequences of that death"

as disfiguring as in the books would be hell to do that kind of makeup from now onthis is the first time ive actually sensed some kind of chemistry between tyrion and shae not much mind youtywin is magnificent in his contempt letting his horse take a shit just before riding into the throne roomfor not having that big of a chest natalie dormer does spectacularly with margaerys cleavage even if it does look rather out of place for a westeros highborn ladynice to see sansa smiling at the knowledge that she now doesnt have to marry joffrey but poor girl just then learns from littefinger that that doesnt mean she can go home or is even out of danger quite the contrary silly girl why didnt you escape with the houndlittlefinger stole sandors line about all being liars why do they give so many of the hounds lines to littlefingersophie turner must have grown quite a bit it looks like shes taller than aidan gillenmore scenes from book 3 with brienne and jaime of course there would otherwise be little for ncw to do this seasontheir bantering was fun and you could tell that he was impressed by her fighting skills and to be honest the actress isnt nearly as ugly as her character is made to be in the bookswhile an unwise move i liked the fact that robb scolded his mother about shes not the one to be reckless when he married talisa who im now convinced really isnt jeyne westerlingi liked that stannis was assertive if a bit abusive towards melisandre hes not to be played and doesnt really believe that much in the lord of light although after watching through those flames i wonderi almost feel sorry for theon he had a great speech and i really thought they would all follow him to meet the besiegers then i laughed so hard when dagmer just whacked himthe line lets go home from dagmer lends me to believe that he isnt reekramsay as some crackpot theories have suggested theyve ditched reek altogether and have dagmer making a deal with the besiegers presumably ramsay bolton and his menwinterfell doesnt seem that sacked when the stark kids emerge but it is sure smoking a lot from it when viewed from a distance so how much was actually destroyed from the books i got the distinct impression that everything except the stone had burnedfor that matter who burned winterfell to the viewer its not immediately clear it could presumably have been the retreating ironborn even though we know it was the bastard of bolton thus the treachery of the boltons arent that apparent yeti think isaac hempsteadwright has grown poor hodor wont be able to carry him around for much longerthis is a problem for the show  the kid actors growing up faster than their characters in the books what if maise williams has a sudden growth spurt and wont be able to pass for a little boy any moreeven the kid playing little rickon was goodconsidering the episode title  valar morghulis  i wasnt surprised that arya got her coin from jaqen she still hasnt retrieved needle i dont remember if shes supposed to already according to the books but didnt she kill that harrenhal guard with it not that she got to do that on hbo alasfinally we had jon killing qhorin halfhand i suppose they dragged this storyline on for a couple of episodes just because he wouldnt have that much to do this season eithernot actually seeing ramsay bolton or mance ryder or the reeds and tullys for that matter saves them in not having to pay the actor salariespredictably the house of the undying didnt reveal much compared to the books doing so would have spoiled too much not even the prophesies but we got a nice scene with dany and imaginary khal drogo and son i dont recall that in the book but maybe the ruins of the red keep and throne room is an intentional foreshadowing dany will take kings landing but there wont be much left when she doescool burning of pyat pree by the dragons though and man they are cutei wasnt at all surprised that xaros vault was empty thats why he wanted the dragons fitting end for him to be locked up inside it but i grieve for doreah i really dont get why she betrayed dany was it just that simple that she didnt want to wander around with her khaleesi any more trying to reclaim a realm on the other side of the worldthe white walker army was creepy but i dont recall them forming up so in the booksi was expecting sam to use the dragon glass but for some odd reason the white walker rider just stared at him and didnt seem inclined to kill himnice ending for the season thoughand damn almost a year until next timegenerally the first season was better it had a more held together storyline whereas this one had lots of rather isolated events all over but the same can be said for the books still there were more weaker episodes and storylines this season for some characters nothing much happened and they sometimes had to accelerate events jaime or invent ones dany"

"tyrus",2012-06-04,"nonreader here with a few observations now i dont mind a spoiler or two and i guess thats why im on this thread i think hearing the back stories from book readers is really interesting and fills in many gaps  even though most of those observations are rants i totally get it so heres where i am after season 1 im thinking  great the starks are going to kings landing and are going to get some revenge  obvious story line also  wtf are those real dragons yeah that chick is going to burn some shit down also why is the coolest stark or nonstark jon snow going to the wall must be pretty pivotal also i cant wait for joffrey and his mom uncledad is get theirs the imp is probably the best character on this show season 2 has me thinking  okay how far does this poor woman have to roam the desert with these dragons shes really going to burn shit down now because really how are you going to stop a dragon robb stark is on a mission  wait a minute whos this chick and why is his quest completely derailed by her wtf  theyre married  why arya is going to be pretty badass someday and may be the one that avenges her father why hasnt joffery and his mom been killed yet its going to be awesome when the lannisters get theirs stannis is pretty cool but that witch hes with will be his demise i dont really seeing this guy going anywhere how many more characters  families  tribes  magical beings can they introduce this year who sacked winterfell and are they going to be sorry when the starks get their shit together this last episode was great  in the context of the others i also know that is tv land the second to the last episode is always the best and the finale is supposed to set up the next season so i guess jon snow will infiltrate the wildlings and destroy them from the inside unlike others i wasnt confused about his battle with the other crow i thought they explained that earlier arya is on a quest to find her family and the face changer was pretty cool robb stark probably fd up pretty good for some unknown reason  i didnt like that whole marriage scene  didnt make sense to me but maybe they have to show the betrayal so that they can kill him off next year the lannisters are still in power and imp got screwed im guessing were not going to see the end of him danys scene at the magicians tower seemed a little weak and rushed as mentioned several times its probably much better in the book but i think i got the point with the little foreshadowing they did include she probably will be queen soon lastly the white walkers seem pretty unstoppable except maybe for dragons  hoping nice way to end the season when i read through this thread and tried to fill in the gaps through character wiki sites i leave very confused so arya never avenges her fathers death but rather will always be on the run and in hiding eventually moving away from the kindoms tyrion will never be king and also is always on the run leaving his family behind dany continues to unsuccessfully try to raise armies and never really becomes the queen the starks will basically be no more the lannisters are always in power it seems that the most important characters havent even been introduced and all of the people weve been watching never amount to anything and will constantly be in hiding i hope this is not the case and next season doesnt disappoint but if it dragged out like this season did i may be done"

"insertname",2012-06-04,"im really not happy with this episode it just confirms that some of the storylines are indeed botched some if it may theoretically get fixed in s3 but i doubt it minor points arya really should have killed someone herself would be somewhat important for her character development i dont think its really clear why winterfell is burned or why the boys have to leave for the most part the subtletly has been taken out of the books for the adaption see littlefinger who is a lot less subtle than hes supposed to be this is something i agree with yet for some reason subtlety has been added to jonqhorin from what ive seen a lot of people have not understood why jon killed qhorin because he never explicitely told jon to do so i see no reason why they had it like that major points a whole freaking army marches by sam and ignores him wha danys entire storyline was so useless we cant take anything out of the prophecies because we cant be sure if dd didnt just botch something up but besides that nothing really happens there were also really a lot of plot holes in the entire storyline so robb marries talisa because he wants tonot because he feels compelled to do by his honor he does it with a clear mind instead of being stricken by grief his mother knows about it yet does nothing besides trying to talk him out of it way to make catelyn more weak imo i feared this would happen its just another way to finish off a bad storyline in the worst possible way really oh yeah and he swears by the seven they changed his entire character really edited by insertname 04 june 2012  0418 pm"
"StannisandDaeny",2012-06-04,"catelyn isnt that weak imo anyone paying attention will have noticed that every time robb ignored her advice and he did so every time it turned for the worse lol i also think her opposing the king rather than being a bitch and saying eddard should do as his king commands defying the kings authority is more dangerous like she did in the books was a twist that made her stronger and then her scene where she stands up to karstark gotta love that harharhar robb is probably being made an asshole of to goad people into a soft landing when he dies after all to most viewers it will seem he did nothing with his army either after his victory over stefford lannister edited by stannisanddaeny 04 june 2012  0421 pm"
"Kvothe the Arcane",2012-06-04,"the major point of happiness i got from this episode was that theon is looking very likely to be in the next series instead of cutting him out for 23 years theres no way they could not include him and hopefully ramsay after that exit i loved tywins arrival really looking forward to him shaking things up and clashing with joffrey as i loved that element in the books the ending beyond the wall was a spectacular cliffhanger also the books ending was much less grandiose tv requires a cliffhanger im also pleased the halfhand was killed by jon albeit in different circumstances i hope they emphasise his remaining loyalty to the watch next series the robbtalisacatelyn side of things is a complete disaster karstark mentioning the seven was bad but the king of the north it was just plain shit from the writers its honestly hard to recognise robb as the king in the north in the show i appreciate the embellishing of robbs character that needed to happen with him on screen instead of far away but they have completely ruined him to many he is nothing in comparison to eddard in terms of likeability through his actions which is something that really came across in the books im similarly disappointed with arya leaving harranhal with clean hands but they can easily rectify that on the road to riverrun she will need something to do after all the house of the undying scenes were interesting but ultimately served absolutely no purpose dany really needed some prophecy thrown around at her along with links to the past ie rhaegar scenes to properly link her character to returning to westeros my non book reader friends reactions to when she doesnt go to westeros is going to be hilarious isnt the point she turns to slavers bay because illyrio sends her the ships back to westeros all in all despite how awesome blackwater was this season has failed to live up to the first alfie allen as theon has been spectacular peter dinklage nailed it again also im hoping next series or two are the best the series have in conjunction with sos being the best book beyond the wall and kings landing are in order for this to happen but the plots in the riverlands and winterfellthe dreadfort seriously need sorting out early on next series to get the show back on track"
"Grey Robb",2012-06-04,"i gave the episode an 8 thought it was great tv decent asoiaf storytelling most stuff has been discussed ad nauseum so im just going to comment on robb robb is a pov lacking fringe character in the books despite truly knowing how he thinks or feels about anything many of us readers are drawn to him id argue because of two things 1 he personifies the legacy of ned stark a character we became very close to in agot and want to see avenged 2 we are influenced to root for him through how hes endeared by other characters particularly catelyn sansa arya jon these 2 dynamics work together to make the rw one of the most shocking and devastating moments in the series robb has been changed in the television series and though i dont necessarily agree with all of the changes i would argue its for the same effect nonbook readers root for the robb of the television series the way us book readers rooted for him in the novels ive talked to several people that are emotionally invested in his character because hes ned son and because they see him as a great warrior and a generally good guy for a lot of them the love story enhances robbs character hes human and he finds peace and love in the midst of war and betrayal hes under tremendous pressure and wants to do the right thing but doesnt always know what that means they have no clue what a blunder hes making how could they it will only serve to make the rw have as great an effect if not a greater on tv show fans as it did on a lot of readers should db and dw accomplish this then i will consider their handling of robbs story a success as a book reader im going to be excited enough to see the build up to and execution of the rw not really all that worried about subtle divergences or plot changes on the way just getting there my wife is going to punch a hole in the wall drunkgif classbbcemoticon altdrunk  lastly i dont think the talisa identity issue is solved just yet otherwise how are they going to resolve robbs difficulty or inability to produce an heir edited by grey robb 04 june 2012  0500 pm"

"DaveSumm",2012-06-04,"after blackwater i actually really learned a lesson in switching off the analyticalbook reader part of my mind and just enjoying it im really glad i did cos this episode was fantastic the extra time really allowed for the scenes to breathe and not feel compressed or rushed and sorry but this is the most out of proportion ive ever seen the fans response on this site sooooooo many people saying the hotu was poorly done its so strange of all the things to get your hopes up aboutdid everyone seriously think that itd be the same as the book hey heres some guy youve never heard of holding a babyheres four ratdwarfs crawling over a naked chickheres some wizards in a hall 99 of the viewers would feel utterly let down that a patchy season for her had ended with some messed up acid trip that made no sense whatsoever converting this stuff to tv isnt just about dropping plots it ultimately is about simplifying stuff familiar faces familiar locationsviewers are now left with hope that dany might see that throne room for real that her dragons are a serious force for her to useit was a good way to end her season and this end scene with the army of wights that every nonbook reader reaction ive seen says its awesomewas awesome yes the other looked a little different he looked awesome yes the army of wights looked like zombies the wights are zombies their description is identical theyre reanimated corpses sorry to be ranty but when they announced this show we were all cool we can see a massive otherwights army attacking the fist then we get itand everyone whinges that they look too much like zombies these zombie creatures well im very satisfied ultimately a clash of kings doesnt fit into ten episodes so stuffs been changed the last two episodes really made up for any weaknesses and im fully confident that season 3 and onward are going to be incredible"

"Shienberg",2012-06-04,"allright so i got through ten pages and just wanted to put down my thoughts before i forget everything i wanted to say some of this has been mentioned by others i am pretty sure it is through sansas story in the books that we learn that since the starks worship the old gods and the tullys worship the seven the stark children worship the old gods and the new while some patriarchs might force the children to take only the fathers religion ned was definately the kinda guy who would want the kids to respect their mothers faith as well we dont ever get to hear robbs internal monolouge but it is not unreasonable to imagine that he leans more to the seven this gigantic mistake is not necessarily such a big deal speaking of gods peter dinklage is a freaking god he owns the screen if he wasnt a small person he would already be established as a robert denirogary oldman calibre actor this series will win him many more awards yes i was initially disappointed with the hotu scene however i do agree with people who acknowledge that it would be too spoilery or take too much to explain the red wedding will be one of the most shocking things to ever happen on tv when it happens so it would be a really bad idea to start showing those cards and of course the tv only crew dont know who rheagar and elia are so that vision would make no sense they will need to explain who elia is eventually though or else they take a lot of oomph out of the battle between the red viper and the mountain all that being siad the two simple changes they could have made a blue rose at the wall would have been a nice foreshadow and would not be too confusing pyat pree could have had a simple bit of dialouge something like  i am keeping you here to save you if you leave you will face three betrayals still for the limits and differences of the televsion medium it was a good scene in the previously on segment before the show aires robb tells roose that any ironborn who surrender will be spared and allowed to return home so it seems obvious that dagmer and co knocked theon out to turn him over and buy their freedom why couldnt they just have a little close up on bran as he leaves winterfell saying its not dead just broken like me i was really hoping to hear this line they are making shae love tyrion wayyyy too much its gonna be hard to believe that she betrays him and bangs his dad and even harder to believe that he is going to strangle her and there is no way they can change these parts of tyrions story i leave the second season a bit frustrated with aryas story for many of us it is one of the favorites i enjoyed the arya tywin stuff just because those two actors make those scenes soo great however so many of aryas iconic moments were changed or eliminated there will be no is there gold in the village killing of the tickler there was no weasal soup no leeches and they skipped over aryas first real intentionall hands on cold blooded kill stableboy not withstanding this is huge for her arc another concern nobody knows that bran and rickon are dead i remember arya overhears this at some point while in harranhal more importantly robb and cat need to know because it would have been better motivation for cat releasing jaime and robb needs to name jon the heir of winterfell before he dies jon turning down stanniss offer to name him lord of winterfell and release him from the nw is important to jons character and his eventual doom or what have you and again maybe i am giving too much credit to the previoiusly on segment but in that they add a little more reminder explanation that qhorin wants jon to kill him and be a spy i think it could have been handled a bit better but the tv audience will figure it out i love the show and i love the books they are seperate things some things that can be told in written form do not translate to good television to be a 100 book purists is irrational and suggests that you may not entirely understand the nuanced differences between the two mediums i do not agree with every change but i think the show creators are doing a remarkable job in adapting source material that is just massive in depth and scope i applaud them and look forward to next season"

"dark  sister",2012-06-04,"i pictured the others as a lot more elegant but the sword it was holding was fantastic i am really glad it was white because all of the other times they have shown others they seem black hairy and apelike so im very happy that it was the ghostly book stylei felt like luwins death was kinda anticlimactic side note did he want to be killed without milk of the poppy in front of the heart tree so that he could be a blood sacrifice to the old gods thoughts but i still got a little choked up frown5gif classbbcemoticon altfrown5 i think that your idea about luwin and the heart tree is a very interesting one  one that never occurred to me although he never mentions milk of the poppy in the book rickon just says you cant die you cant and shaggydog mirrors his feelings luwin says im an old man i can die if i want to what was interesting that happened in the book was the fact that despite his obviously painful wound he dragged himself up to the heart tree that makes me think that your point may have some validity to itok my opinion about the episodeits a much more complex reaction than ive had to all the other episodes and thats not because it was the finale overall as one who has read the books i understood everything that was going on even with the major changes that the producers madefor instance  theon gives a rousing speech to the ironborn men then dagmer knocks him out i put that name in quotes because he is not at all like the dagmer cleftjaw who was pretty much a foster father to theon in the book so the question is for not only the book readers but also especially the nonreaders how long had his men been plotting against him was it dagmer who convinced the other men that it would be better to abandon their prince an act of treason and raze winterfell to the ground in other threads there have been discussions about just how much gold is in winterfell and the conclusions were not nearly as much as places like highgarden casterly rock or kl ok i guess they could take the tapestries and other valuables but then what they become rogues broken men what happens when balon and asha hear about thisor was dagmer in some sort of plot with ramsay but that wouldnt be possible because they supposedly killed all the ravens that part was confusing to memy mother has gotten into the series but refuses to read the books i can understand why  shes originally from iran and although she can read just fine shes always found fantasy a little confusing something about the fake names and places make it hard for her to get it i suppose i keep encouraging her to read the books but let me just tell you guys from her perspective what she found confusing and shes a smart womanfirst of all the others i tried to explain to her that in the series they hadnt really explained the difference between a wight and an other i then tried to explain it to her and her befuddled expression spoke volumes i explained again and she kind of understood as the army was passing by she wondered why sam wasnt killed by the other who looked straight at him i said that i had no idea i was confused about that as wellsecondly the ironborn part which i just brought up i explained that they probably didnt respect theon and was sick of him so they decided to burn winterfell and take the belongingsthirdly she didnt understand at all what was going on in the hotu she didnt know why the throne room was in ashes and it was snowing at first i thought all of the white stuff was ashes and hey maybe it was so i had to explain to her something from the book and the vision she had of her father  him pacing up and down the throne room muttering let him be king over ashes let him be king over charred bones and cooked meat then dany goes into the tent with drogo and her son little side note those babys eyes looked purple to me interesting that they made his hair dark too i told her that this vision was not in the book but that there were other ones that were far more important i explained that there were other visions and words that were extremely important but hadnt been included in the episode she was puzzled with their decision not to include those thingsshe was absolutely astounded by jaqens transformation into another man and it was quite comical because she kept begging me to tell her how he did it i said i couldnt give away secrets that i didnt have the answers to i did tell her what valar morghulis means thoughshe also wondered how the dragonfire didnt burn her but did burn pyat pree that kind of niggled at me as well  i mean it was between her but definitely close enough to cause at least second degree burns i dont care how immune to fire is which apparently shes not if im not mistaken  her walking into the flames was a one time deal when she confronted drogo at the pit i dont think she even got scalded  i wish martin would make up his mindshe also didnt understand what pyat pree meant about his magic working now that dragons were bornthen there was the scene with qhorin halfhand she was shocked that he killed him so i had to explain how it was set up in the book i told her the whole scene about him asking if his blade was sharp etc etcok so why am i talking so much about my mothers reactions to the episode instead of my own the reason is because i think she represents a viewer with aboveaverage intelligence who is absolutely confused by these scenes which they changed and distortedto sum up my view i enjoyed the episode especially the part where dany has her dragons burn pp while shes chained  a powerful image of course i liked the others bit the horn was a greatsounding horn too and i also pretty much enjoyed everything else however enjoying it isnt the same as not being confused with some of the decisions the producers made i guess my big question would be this why why did they decide to put in that fake story in qarth pp and xxd conspiring to take her dragons irri dying doreah not being dead dany not getting her crown not meeting barristan selmy and getting the shipsi think that putting the book storyline into the season with some trimming of course would have been the same level of complication as this new plot line they decided to go with my reasoning is that they wanted to put in major suspense by having the dragons stolen but they could have built up the same level of suspense many other ways one way being danys realization that she is nothing but a rich beggar threatened by greedy qartheens and trying to get a ship out of there i think her getting a crown would have been a brilliant scene really they could have also put in barristan selmy following her  not just that one day at the docks but throughout the season trying to see what her personality was likei feel like instead they wasted a lot of screen time with excessive nudity and sex scenes or dialogue scenes where people just mocked each other one scene that comes instantly to mind is bronn trimming his nails and tyrion complaining about it  whats the point i am not a prude by any means in fact when i go to the beach i go to a nude one and im from america hehe but i found it to be excessive there wasnt even any sexposition most of the time what do other people think maybe im reading it wrongmy main conclusion is that it was an entertaining episode and finale to watch but that it also brought with it much confusion  not just to me but especially to the poor fans out there who havent read the books methinks that quite a few more people will be picking up the books now and trolling through them because of this finale alone eekgif classbbcemoticon alteek  could it be a sly marketing ploy no no not reallyalthough one never knows rightokthe scene between stannis and melisandre was utterly ridiculous the woman drank poison and wasnt killed and she reads her own future in the flames before anyone elses for stannis to choke her and for her to be at his utter mercy was soooooo unreal when i say unreal i literally mean it couldnt have happened it did not fit in with either of their characters  esp stannis supposedly seeming some bullshit in the flames that really irked meand of course this cannot be denied  the nadir of the episode was robbs marrying lady talisa migasdidfsdfswtf her name is in the name of the seven that left me speechless for a moment literally before i started to swear and curse about how false this was for robbs character totally aside from that  thats just a little thing although its almost little the way a little piece of glass lodged in your lung is little  theres his selfishness in revoking his vow to the freys and marrying her against his mothers wishes what made the rw so tragic was that robb was killed in a very similar way that ned was  he did it to shield a womans honor ned tried to honor cersei and her children and robb tried to honor jeyne westerlings virginity and of course the circumstances are so important he had just learned of his brothers deaths and was deeply wounded the storyline they made for robb and talisa was so close to a twilight romance between edward and bella that you could slide a hair between the differenceso now when the rw happens people will be saying well it was his fault everyone warned him not to do it but he did it anyway or if they dont have feelings quite that blunt theyll still have that memory of it being his stubborn choice now i wonder that if they do the rw scene will talisa be there will it be robb who cannot bear to part from talisa and so she walks into her own death trap or will it play out pretty much like it did in the books ah so many questionsand one more thing i pray you even though its off topic  personally i and probably others believe talisa is a spy for tywin or jeyne westerling or whateverthefuck right after arya reads that note about robb they go to a scene with her writing a message calling herself a brilliant liar saying shes writing the lannisters about his movements etc etc but the interesting thing that im sure people caught was she was just holding the note whilst robb was there but when catelyn comes to see them she rolls up the note quickly thats because she knows she can keep robbs attention by batting her big brown eyes at him but she cannot do the same with catelyn and fearing that catelyn will ask to see the note she pretty much flees right after introducing herself i also think that her story while it may be true was used manipulatively to play on robbs sense of mercy sense of honor sympathy etc so a giggling smiling talisa may not have just been in love and eager to make love as one poster said after the episode aired but in actuality a sly giggle that she has him now and its a short step from hot sex to a marriage of a young manso thats my complex reaction entertaining confusing let down as always and hopeful edited by dark sister 04 june 2012  1049 pm"

"AegonTheUnlikely",2012-06-04,"my own 2 cents regarding the theonwinterfell arc and ending in a season which i found enjoyable changes and all i found the theon story to be the most well executed alfie allen really nailed the character and some of the most moving scenes of the season were in this bit if youve read the books you ought to be able to predict what happened after theon is knocked out clearly dagmer et al were taking robbs offer to turn over theon and flee what i presume happened was that when the prisoner exchange was made ramsay simply kills all the iron born puts winterfell to the torch and tells everyone theon did it it gives the audience a cliffhanger regarding theon and allows the show to obscure the bolton treachery for a while longer thats important so that the rw next season comes as enough of a shock further theon and ramsay sort of disappear until what adwd theres not much theyre doing on screen for a while but i have to assume theyre casting ramsay see stannis treatment last year and theyre not going to let allen go for two years my bet is that we get introduced to reek another of ramsays prisoners next year he toys with theon in some fashion around the same time the red wedding is happening and the boltons treachery is revealed reek is revealed as ramsay the bastard of the dreadfort commence flaying"

"Shienberg",2012-06-05,"nonreader here with a few observations now i dont mind a spoiler or two and i guess thats why im on this thread i think hearing the back stories from book readers is really interesting and fills in many gaps  even though most of those observations are rants i totally get it so heres where i amafter season 1 im thinking  great the starks are going to kings landing and are going to get some revenge  obvious story line also  wtf are those real dragons yeah that chick is going to burn some shit down also why is the coolest stark or nonstark jon snow going to the wall must be pretty pivotal also i cant wait for joffrey and his mom uncledad is get theirs the imp is probably the best character on this showseason 2 has me thinking  okay how far does this poor woman have to roam the desert with these dragons shes really going to burn shit down now because really how are you going to stop a dragon robb stark is on a mission  wait a minute whos this chick and why is his quest completely derailed by her wtf  theyre married  why arya is going to be pretty badass someday and may be the one that avenges her father why hasnt joffery and his mom been killed yet its going to be awesome when the lannisters get theirs stannis is pretty cool but that witch hes with will be his demise i dont really seeing this guy going anywhere how many more characters  families  tribes  magical beings can they introduce this year who sacked winterfell and are they going to be sorry when the starks get their shit togetherthis last episode was great  in the context of the others i also know that is tv land the second to the last episode is always the best and the finale is supposed to set up the next season so i guess jon snow will infiltrate the wildlings and destroy them from the inside unlike others i wasnt confused about his battle with the other crow i thought they explained that earlier arya is on a quest to find her family and the face changer was pretty cool robb stark probably fd up pretty good for some unknown reason  i didnt like that whole marriage scene  didnt make sense to me but maybe they have to show the betrayal so that they can kill him off next year the lannisters are still in power and imp got screwed im guessing were not going to see the end of him danys scene at the magicians tower seemed a little weak and rushed as mentioned several times its probably much better in the book but i think i got the point with the little foreshadowing they did include she probably will be queen soon lastly the white walkers seem pretty unstoppable except maybe for dragons  hoping nice way to end the seasonwhen i read through this thread and tried to fill in the gaps through character wiki sites i leave very confused so arya never avenges her fathers death but rather will always be on the run and in hiding eventually moving away from the kindoms tyrion will never be king and also is always on the run leaving his family behind dany continues to unsuccessfully try to raise armies and never really becomes the queen the starks will basically be no more the lannisters are always in power it seems that the most important characters havent even been introduced and all of the people weve been watching never amount to anything and will constantly be in hiding i hope this is not the case and next season doesnt disappoint but if it dragged out like this season did i may be donevery spoilery reply from a book readersome explanationsthe starks are not no more aside from robb and ned all of the starks remain active in the story including undead catlyen who was revived by thoros of mir who is another red priest similar to melissandre  i guess that the red god gives his priests one dark power for mel its shadow babies and for thoros he can revive the dead but i think only one dead at a time since berric seems to do a trade off with cat anyway cat is running around with thoros who has been mentioned in the show and will be introduced next year and the brotherhood without banners who have also been mentioned and will be introduced rickon is off in skagos and davos is off to retrieve him bran is in the north but is learning to travel through the weirwoods littlefinger has revealed his plan to return sansa from hiding to make her claim as the heir of winterfell since arya is mia and peeps think bran and rickon are dead arya is training with the faceless men while she is supposed to forget herself completely there are suggestions that she is retaining pieces of her identity such as hiding needle for later use my guess with arya is that her desire to get home and try to find jon or sansa while begin her plans for vengance will interrupt her faceless men training she will learn enough to be a competent assassian but leave early and join up with nymeria to wreck havoc on westeros jon is mostly dead and any fan of the princess bride knows that mostly dead is partly alive like all the stark kids except sansa due to the loss of lady jon is a warg the end of dance with dragons suggests that jon will live inside ghost while he heals or is frozen for revival tyrion is in mereen i think i cant ever keep all the essos cities straight with ser jorah and barristan i believe he will reveal himself to barristan and assisit with the defense plans for the impending attack dany is in a bit of a pickle now but i think the show now more than anything has hinted that her eventual path to westeros will be bringing her to the wall and jon snow who by the time she gets there will ber revealed as azor ahai jon and dany will fall in love and jons targ identity will be revealed and then one of them will die and the other will rule alone ad george gives us all one last fuck you with loveanyway my point is that he spreads the story out rediculously far but there are clear signs that he is pulling it all back togetherdont give up"
"SerMattHelm",2012-06-05,"  theon gets knocked out for laughs and then how exactly do those ironborn go out of the castle i guess all those northerners waiting outside just let them go right while they carry knocked out theon is that right why are those ironborn carrying theon at all and then why is winterfell burned at all who was fightinghi all  first post hererobb ordered roose bolton to give all surrendering ironborn free passage  all but theon i imagine that offer has been somehow conveyed to them it would be a nice touch if the bastard of bolton were to be introduced in s3 with a background of flayed staked krakens as he obviously betrayed them and butchered them before sacking winterfellsome thoughts on season 2 i thoroughly disliked the daenerys storyline postdrogo she is drifting aimlessly with no sense of purpose at all beyond an increasingly vague claim to the iron throne this fits in with the adaptation as such it is not anchored in the history of asoiaf other than roberts scene in the crypt of winterfell all the way back in the pilot the series has given us very little of the backstory that is the true foundation of the events we are witnessing i realize that putting all visions in the hotu would have been too expensive but it need not have been realized visually  why not have voices whispering offscreen about the three heads and the three treasons"
"PatrickStormborn",2012-06-05,"she also wondered how the dragonfire didnt burn her but did burn pyat pree that kind of niggled at me as well  i mean it was between her but definitely close enough to cause at least second degree burns i dont care how immune to fire is which apparently shes not if im not mistaken  her walking into the flames was a one time deal when she confronted drogo at the pit i dont think she even got scalded  i wish martin would make up his mindshe also didnt understand what pyat pree meant about his magic working now that dragons were bornon the hbo website dany is described as being impervious to fire daenerys is mourning the death of her husband drogo but has not stopped strategizing her return to the seven kingdoms to take back the iron throne impervious to fire dany used the heat of drogos funeral pyre to hatch the dragon eggs she was given as a wedding gift and now considers the three young dragons her childrenok so why am i talking so much about my mothers reactions to the episode instead of my own the reason is because i think she represents a viewer with aboveaverage intelligence who is absolutely confused by these scenes which they changed and distorteddo you not think that maybe viewers are supposed to be confused for example were not supposed to know what happened to theon and winterfell yet although it seems quite obvious to readers that the ironborn handed over theon and then boltons men burned the placeas for the others i dont understand the confusion about sam being spared the others do what the others want if they want sam to go back to the wall theyll let him go back to the wall theyre not just mindless killing machinesokthe scene between stannis and melisandre was utterly ridiculous the woman drank poison and wasnt killed and she reads her own future in the flames before anyone elses for stannis to choke her and for her to be at his utter mercy was soooooo unreal when i say unreal i literally mean it couldnt have happened it did not fit in with either of their characters  esp stannis supposedly seeming some bullshit in the flames that really irked mewe dont know what happened with stannis between the end of the battle of the blackwater and davos rescue  all we know is that he only saw melisandre during this time we also know that this is when he starts to see visions in the fire so if it really irked you here it should have irked you in the book"

"Rockroi",2012-06-05,"just a quick word of defense for the dany storyline and i have to reiterate that i really disliked her story line this season in the book dany has very very little time in clash of kings dany has five whole chapters conversely tyrion has fifteem therefore the series had very very little to go on i must also repeat something that gets lost on people in the books martin only has to deal with his own tastes and storyconstraints in dealing with writing the books dany has no say in what happens to her but in the show there is an actress as dany and her and her agents and publicists  demand screen time and explinationsa s to why she cannot be in more episodes same is true for jaime cat etc etc etc the creators have to do something or the major cast members will be problematic and may not return this has already happened with at least one minor character gregor i bring this up because well dany has to do something now my gripe is that what they actually did was empty calories it took up time and space but gave the viewer nothing back in return i do not care at all not even a little bit about a foolish powergrab in qarth dont care about the king how he came from nothing nor the writers incessent need to mention that every time the guy opens his mouth a clear sign that the writers have nothing to say i dont care about a vault i dont care about the mercahnts who wont help dany and i dont care about the politics that have no effect zero ziltch nada on the story as a whole danys story line would have been perfect had the producers took the approach that less is more just minimize her and present the house of the undying as a great mystery to all less is more nobody is certain what happens there etc but they have become restless recently etc etc etc prye convinces dany that he will help her by giving her the secrets of the house always take the last door on the left etc etc etc maybe put something in there where dany becomes separated from drogon if you want to seal the kidnapping angle make it a twopart episode and youre done no king of qarth no senseless murder scenes seriously how easy is it to kill a council of 13 no kidnapping just a tighter leaner storythis is why when people say bah purists suck might as well say nothing at all its not puristy im after its a soilid story some of my favorite scenes have been ones never touched upon in the books ie cersei and robert stannis and davos discussing storms end obviously blackwater was reimagined but when you diverge from the story and fill that time up with a void with vapid and unimaginative details when the story tells me a lot about a but does it at the expense of b c and d when you turn a porterhouse steak into hamburger well i dont have to jump up and say thank you sir may i have another thats what danys story line was a lot of filler a lot of fat a lot of empty calories that did not advance the story but instead drew us away from more interesting lands and more interesting times"

"nymeria235",2012-06-05,"i think the main problem with this episode and the season in general is an innapropriate allocation of clarity money and importance to certain scenes the decisions to focus on some things rather than others have mostly been bad for example i dont know if any nonbook reader understood anything with the sacking of winterfell two minutes of the iron born surrending themselves two seconds of seeing the troops destroying winterfell i understand ramsay was not cast and therefore could not be shown but something there was almost no clarification about jon and qh the two characters intentions were not clear again two second conversation you must do what is right when the time comes etc its not like in the books it was vague it was very clear i do understand not including many visions in the house of the undying because putting them visually would be giving too much away and people would be confused this means that the visions they did show didnt have to be solong and drawn out would have been a lot more dramatic with shorter faster paced visions cutting to seeing dany a huffin and puffin trying to find a way outway to her dragons robb and talisa getting married in light of the seven was a major dissapointment thought perhaps it sets the scene for the northermen to not want to follow robb anymore theyve met him a lot less likeable in the show i remember in the books i cried a lot when he died dunno if it will have the same effect now the scene with varys and ros was kind of long though from hbos standpoint maybe theyre trying to keep the intrigue of book readers we do want to see what role ros will play this will only work in my opinion if she remains clothed for the remainder of the season jaimebrienne scene was brilliant because it was well acted but all in all not really relevant to this season could have been cut out and shown next season in my opinion the last scene dissapointed me the most a lot could have been cut out to make it more dramatic would have been nice to see reactions also from other men of the night watch as they hear the blasts on the third blasts everyone shits themselves we see an army of wights and others just to really clarify things we zoom in to see their blue eyes all we see are blue eyes because of the blizzard rampaging all around them and then thats it the money saved from doing the cgi this season they could always do it next could have bought ghost maybe a bit more in the house of the undying like blue flowers mayhaps could have perhaps also bought a more dramatic face change though this i think is too much to hope for could have actually scene the destruction of winterfell happening through summers pov which would have clarified things a lot more i did really love the aryajaquen scene i love when she says she needs to find her brother and mother and my sister tooi need to find my sister teared up a bit the master luwin scene with bran and rickon were also tearjerking the scene with tyrion and shae wasinteresting i have a feeling that tyrion doesnt 100 buy the fact that shae truly loves him he cries because her response is so perfectalso where he is money is shaes responses and declarations of love to tyrion remind me a bit of sansas automatic defensive words of priase for joffrey i loved the idea of xaro s vault being empty important lesson to be learned interesting too since danys whole claim to the throne is one empty vault so to speak is it just me or did her whole khalesar come back from the dead i feared that hbo would want to explain what valor morghulis is and im happy that were left not knowing it was the same way in the books i remember having the phrase always on the tip of my tongue just like arya did knowing that it meant something profound but not knowing perhaps on this journey arya undertakes now she will finally kill someone as we all know she must"

"Former Lord of Winterfell",2012-06-05,"thats what danys story line was a lot of filler a lot of fat a lot of empty calories that did not advance the story but instead drew us away from more interesting lands and more interesting timesdanys story is mostly filler and i think theres a pretty logical reason for thatthe series was supposed to be only three books long in a three book series danys arc is pretty clear book 1 is her marrying drogo drogo dying and her hatching the dragons book 2 is her dragons growing up remembering the 5 year gap that was supposed to happen and her gathering forces and book 3 was going to be her return to westerosi think what happened is that the story of what was happening in westeros expanded because of massive content and complexity first to four books then six and now seven but there really wasnt ever a seven book storyline for danaerys in essos so to a large extent danaerys story was artificially expanded with a bunch of filler so that she didnt just not appear in a bunch of books in essence shes marking time while the rest of the story catches up and thats how grrm ended up stuck in the infamous meereenees knot and why danys chapters have seemed to drag its because it was never intended that there would need to be so many chapters in the first placei would not be at all surprised if the showrunners varied significantly from the books with respect to danaerys they want her to have an interesting compelling story of her own and im not sure they can find that just in the books themselves without some pretty significant changes"
"dark  sister",2012-06-05,"just a quick word of defense for the dany storyline and i have to reiterate that i really disliked her story line this season in the book dany has very very little time in clash of kings dany has five whole chapters conversely tyrion has fifteem therefore the series had very very little to go oni must also repeat something that gets lost on people in the books martin only has to deal with his own tastes and storyconstraints in dealing with writing the books dany has no say in what happens to her but in the show there is an actress as dany and her and her agents and publicists  demand screen time and explinationsa s to why she cannot be in more episodes same is true for jaime cat etc etc etc the creators have to do something or the major cast members will be problematic and may not return this has already happened with at least one minor character gregori bring this up because well dany has to do something now my gripe is that what they actually did was empty calories it took up time and space but gave the viewer nothing back in return i do not care at all not even a little bit about a foolish powergrab in qarth dont care about the king how he came from nothing nor the writers incessent need to mention that every time the guy opens his mouth a clear sign that the writers have nothing to say i dont care about a vault i dont care about the mercahnts who wont help dany and i dont care about the politics that have no effect zero ziltch nada on the story as a wholedanys story line would have been perfect had the producers took the approach that less is more just minimize her and present the house of the undying as a great mystery to all less is more nobody is certain what happens there etc but they have become restless recently etc etc etc prye convinces dany that he will help her by giving her the secrets of the house always take the last door on the left etc etc etc maybe put something in there where dany becomes separated from drogon if you want to seal the kidnapping angle make it a twopart episode and youre done no king of qarth no senseless murder scenes seriously how easy is it to kill a council of 13 no kidnapping just a tighter leaner storythis is why when people say bah purists suck might as well say nothing at all its not puristy im after its a soilid story some of my favorite scenes have been ones never touched upon in the books ie cersei and robert stannis and davos discussing storms end obviously blackwater was reimagined but when you diverge from the story and fill that time up with a void with vapid and unimaginative details when the story tells me a lot about a but does it at the expense of b c and d when you turn a porterhouse steak into hamburger well i dont have to jump up and say thank you sir may i have anotherthats what danys story line was a lot of filler a lot of fat a lot of empty calories that did not advance the story but instead drew us away from more interesting lands and more interesting timesman you are just dead on you said so eloquently exactly what i was thinking kudos"

"Lyana",2012-06-05,"so here we go in order of appearance the opening scene was nicely done tyrions awakening still hearing the screams and seeing the fire and than something alsmost as awful  maester pycelles smile it is a new day a new hand and a totally new situation the horse shitting was a proper introduction for the proclaiming of the new heroes of the day the tyrells are nailing it and sansas smile was priceless still dont get why theve cast dontos now that we already know who the secret helper of sansa is but i guess everything lf does happens for a reason so well just have to wait and see the point of his early revelation soooo ros serves some purpose not sure what to say about that if the writers have included her in the final episode and wasted some of their precious time for her i guess she has some important part to play as a spy for varys either that or the show just wants to ensure us that varys is in fact an eunuch the briennejaime part was there just to remind us that they still exist  the weird lady knight and the man without honour those two have great chemistry so i dont mind the screentime the show makers spent on them well heres my first minor complaint as a fresh stannis fan i cheered his heroic appearance in the previous episode but here him choking mel admitting that he killed his brother with a shadow baby does he even know about this in the book complaining about the red god and right after that suddenly seeing sth in the flames seems a bit weird to me and was that some kind of foreshadowing about mel telling him that he will betray everyone and everything who is he the nk i liked theons scene in the context of the show alfie did a great job and didnt make me hate the character less than i do in the books liked the conversation with him and lewin and he has said it straight  there is no turning back he went too far already and the moment with his speech kind of preserved the atmosphere of the books and reminded me again why i like martins world so much in a standard goodbadguy story we will see a man give a heroic speech making his men want to die in a battle for glory but in got nope the guy gives a speech only to get hit on the head and betrayed by his own men now thats a good story i guess the catelynrobb and the robbtalissa dont care how it is spelled scenes were a necessity to close up robbs story in season two and to set up the future events that will be of great importance here is of course the question abot bran and rickons death why havent they been used as a catalyst for the release of jaime and the wedding of robb that would have been more plausible and wouldnt have made catelyn and robb look like complete idiots the jeynetalissa thing is also a black spot for me but i hope we will get some good explanation later as the story goes on i still stay optimistic on this one aryas scene was solid liked it although jaquens question if she would go with him seemed a bit strange i hope we get to see him later with his pretty face because the second dude was scary bran and rickons scenes were heartbreaking i wept a tear there i admit good to see at least some direwolves this is an evidence that all the direwolves did not just magically disappear perhaps only those beyond the wall and here we come to the scene that we all have waited for at least i did for the whole season the houscene in the books is the reason for half the topics in this forum i was eager to see how d  d will handle this my expectations were pretty low but i hoped and the result is  somehow not surprising it was kind of a letdown for the bookreader in me but on the other hand hey we can speculate on the tv version as well and there are some things to speculate on but in another thread i know i knew the writers had two options  either to skip the scene completely the spoilers are too many and too obvious or to present entirely new visions but still related to future events as they did im pretty sure those are not just some random visions  the show is way better than that a minor nitpick though dany is supposed not to be fireproof in the books did the show makers decided to change that why on earth would they do that i have several posts about the mishandled depiction of jon snow in the tv show i definitely dont like what d  d made of him in the second season but in episode 8 qhorin makes very clear his intention about inflitrating jon into the wildlings as a doubleagent i just hope the nonbook readers remembered that and i will be probably the 999th person to ask that but where the hell is ghost is he the worst direwolf ever or what the people who bet on the second seasons ending with the 3 hornblasts are probably happy it was a creepy scene and i got goosebumps when i heared that ww screaming or whatever he was doing i got some weird feeling about the way theyve presented the wws they seem more humanoid as i have pictured them  like humans whose spirit has been taken away or something nights king anyone why did the ww look at sam and did nothing perhaps it has something to do with coldhands or who knows im sure that there is some explanation so i wont be in hurry to criticize the final look over the army of wights was creepy as hell overall i liked it and look forward for the next season"

"Ciglon",2012-06-05,"kind of disappointed how stannis character has been all over the place this last series but hopefully the future episodes will help clear up what kind of man and ruler stannis iswould be i feel that most nonbook readers only like the fact that he fought bravely against the lannisters but there have been hardly any moments that define his character as a just man who believes in ruling with an iron fist laws should be made of iron not of pudding and ultimately a man who does not want the crown unlike every other usurper in westeros right now but rather sees that the crown is his by rights and because of his belief of the importance of law to a society demands that the law be upheld absolutely"

"dark  sister",2012-06-09,"again strawman arguments but im oh so greateful for your consideration of my well being there indeedchucklescan you explain to me why you call these peoples comments straw man fallacies because heres what i consider a straw man fallacy if you dont think that assassinating bin laden was a good thing youre like a terrorist yourself who wants to support him i dont understand what any of these people said that were straw menby the way are you from the us or britain i ask bc of the way you write  and i mean no offense by that i just want to understand why you keep using that term where it doesnt really applyalso i consider myself a booktotv purist i suppose but i realized a couple of episodes into season 2 that dd would not be following the same course they did as in season one the two seasons are so different from each other imho its almost like two different sets of producers made them so if you are one who considers the purity important i totally empathize with you but i do think you are being a little bit hostile towards people who are just asking you simple questions and i understand when i first came to this board some comments or issues really inflamed me and i would be hostile myself  but now i try to realize that the more civil a conversation between the users are the more likely we are to accomplish the goal of getting our points across people are much more likely to listen to us if we treat them respect instead of chuckling at them contemptuously yknow or thats what the chuckle seemed like at least  i could be wrong"
"dark  sister",2012-06-09,"of course my ladyfirst let me state that for an argument to be a strawman it doesnt need to be something overblown its simply must state something that has no actual conection or truth in it  put in a way that tries to forcefully and fakely make it seem like the other party is actually thinking such thingslets take the book purist for example if someone acuses me im a book purist they are strawmaning me  because that term means im supposedly someone who would want a complete 100 adaptation from the book to the visual medium  which is physical imposibility literallynot exactly even saying you think that assassinating bin laden was a bad thing is enough to be a strawman argument  if that person havent actually stated anything close to that point of view but yes thats it more or lessi see what you mean now my lord smilepng classbbcemoticon alt  i have never fully researched what does or doesnt constitute a straw man fallacy the example i made up was drawn from what i had been taught in high school english writing class more or less so i suppose youre rightdo you actually want a 100 complete adaptation of every word every scene as it goes in the books chapter for chapter each and every description of clothes and food and everything else to be transplanted into a visual mediumwell thenno no thats not what i mean by purist at all of course translating one medium to the other in the way you described would be impossible an exercise in futility etcbut lets say that compared to other people who seem very accepting of plot lines that werent in the books as well as omissions i am a purist although i try to suppress it to a certain extent because i know how hard it is to include everything thats significant one example of something important that couldnt be included in the first season was the information about rhaegar lyanna and neds recollections of the tower of joy but i understood how hard it is to make a dream sequence seem coherenthowever certain aspects of the second season that do annoy me as a purist was the inclusion of ros in so many pointless nudity scenes and dialogue scenes becauseand let me say this delicately for fear of getting another warning pointi dont think it was necessary for her to be in the season as much as she was hint hint wink wink nudge nudge those are the politics of hollywood that can make me a little pissedalso the execution of some of the modified plot lines imho left viewers very very confused not just confused in the way one should be confused and anticipating when one reaches a cliffhanger but just genuinely trying to figure out what the heck was going on i watched the show with intelligent viewers who hadnt read the books so i know that for a fact so thats what i mean when i call myself a puristsince the first season it was clear the production is overrun with numerous so called executive producers mingling and adjusting all of it being a burden and an overall pain in thesomethingas stated in that one interview with the company that did cgi  which then hasnt been taken for a second seasonnot to mention constant changes of directors and writers too which isnt the best thing imaginable by itselfthats interesting because while i noticed all the executive producers and directors aside from the constant benioff  weiss i never read about the interview with the cgi company and the effect it may have had on the series i did notice how little danys dragons were shown in the second season and also there were decisions made concerning the dragons which i didnt understand  why not just follow the book where dany remembers what viserys said about only men and dragons eating cooked meat instead of calling him a fool countless times yes he was vain and proud but he actually did know a lot about dragons if she had even just said that line about dragons eating cooked meat the confusion over whether they ate at all while crossing the red waste and indeed in qarth would have been solved they wouldnt have even had to have shown the dragonspurity in the sense i described above  certainly not it is not possible at alli consider end quality and good decisions about what gets changed and even more imprtantly how it is changed  important essentialwell i totally agree with that im sorry if you misunderstood mehostile this is not hostility just a fully fledged discussion between adultsand my arguments and reactions to lack of actual arguments from the other side which prefers to use strawman arguments and simplistic logical falacies as defensei appreciate the sentiment and yes you didnt understand that chuckle entirely correctly it wasnt contempt but meriment khal pono then went and proved it in his next answeror walked right into it shall we say dont worry im sure he will be alright after a maester or two look him overhaha okay  you see its really hard to read what someones tone is when its in print sometimes other times its all too obvious and very hostileanyway thanks for the explanations edited by dark sister 09 june 2012  0515 pm"
"Sunni",2012-06-09,"im enjoying the series a lot its interesting to follow the changes from the books hbo seems to be solving something that troubles me with the books which i love otherwise and that is the sheer number of characters i really got lost in during the book that begins with is it 7 acolytes at the citadel i kept thinking how hard it was to keep the names straight to my mind its better especially on television to have the main characters interact with each other more i loved arya and tywins interactions i loved seeing littlefinger with the tyrells and with catelyn i loved seeing khal drogo in the house of the undying i dont think backstory would play well on tv sure i love the story about rhaegar and the prophecies but i dont think id be able to absorb it in a 4858 minute episode that also deals with the many many other main characters when reading it helps that i can reread chapters of the books or look at the family trees or find the dunk and egg stories etc reading is a completely different experience along those lines i cant imagine were going to get an entire tv season where dany sansa and cersei just dont appear at least i hope not im also going to have to watch the valar morghulis episode again because i only saw wights at the end i didnt notice any white walkers just the slow clumsy wights im not sure i remember seeing the others at all where they in the very first episode"
"Ser Dontos",2012-06-09,"quarth has changed a lot but i cant say i dont like the changes the whole dany story seems to be heavily altered but it makes sense in terms of character development all the other changes in the season are mostly good imho since the goal of each story seems to be the same the main difference between books and tv adaptation is basically the pov or better the lack of in the books we always experience what the character sees hears and feels but in the tv series we are the invisible observer we cant read the feelings of the characters i think thats the main reason way some scenes had to be altered since some points of the book story only make sense if one can read the characters thoughts and feelingsall in all its a good episode its not like in the books but i never liked danys adventures anyway the only thing i didnt like was the fact that the ww didnt do anything about samim also going to have to watch the valar morghulis episode again because i only saw wights at the end i didnt notice any white walkers just the slow clumsy wights im not sure i remember seeing the others at all where they in the very first episodethe white thing riding the horse and looking at sam is apperently a walker shortly before the credits show up theres another mounted ww"

"RoamingRonin",2012-06-05,"question still stands then if the other knows he is there  whether via sensing him or actually seeing  why is he letting him live maybe it is a predator like reason  if he is unarmed and not a threat then they will leave them alone that doesnt really follow with what we have seen but maybe it is the reason the white walker didnt seem like he knew there was a living thing here it just seemed like he heard a noise looked and decided it wasnt worth checking i just never got the impression the ww knew for a fact that there was someonesomething hiding behind the rock"
"Tywin's bastard",2012-06-05,"the simple answer is that you asked the wrong question the logical question is why didnt the white walker kill sam right away the army is marching forward but the ww sits still on his horse so theres nothing whatsoever saying that he wont try to kill him i can imagine that while the wight army assaults the fist the white walker tries to kill sam the others kept their distance from the battle in the book so theyll probably stay behind here as well so wait until things have actually played out"

"A Stark in Salem",2012-06-05,"all sorts of interesting theories here but mostly i think the ones that simply say it was a poorly thought out and executed scene hit closest to the markbut what really surprises me is so many readers idea the grrm has no actual positions on evil that just does not bear out on actual examination granted there are several characters who start out bad misguided or basically arseholes who gradually redeem themselves we could have jamie as exhibit no1 but certainly there are others and there are a number of characters that are initially seen as basically good who then fall very far from grace most obviously theon many of the rest sort of are in between many remain more or less in the camp they start out in tyrion most of starks dany and others all try to do the right thing though at times are forced to do the hard thing which isnt always nice plenty of others like cersie joffery and others seem to want nothing but more power and actually enjoy the destruction they wreak to get it plenty of them die or have a long fall oft times because of arrogance and blind ambition but that doesnt change how bad they were when they could bebut then we have a whole cast that is never portrayed as anything other than relentlessly completely utter cruel and sadistic in short they are evil regardless of what motivations they might justify their actions the mountain is commits nothing short of genocide in this series alone hes like one of those nazi ss commanders who goes out of his way to kill as many in his path and if an opportunity for extra and pain and cruelty is there he takes it every time ditto most of the above for all the bloody mummer and the brave companions and lastly ramsey snow who is practically a caricature of an evil sadist no grey in there guys hes evil and no amount of excuses can amend ithow about all the slavers over the sea grrm goes to great lengths to show show twisted and despicable they are nailing up 157 live kids to die awful slow deaths on wooden posts for dany to see as she heads to their city where is the grey in that i may askjust because creatures or beings are sentient and have motivations does not make them not evil the only things that might not be evil are animals and events that have no free will but even animals can be made to be cruel and violent beyond their normal capacity at that point they become agents of the evil intentions of their mastersall the worst evils committed by humans from the dawn of history all the way to the streets of syria today usually had some sort of motivation generally absolute power but as often to inflict pain and suffering for very little reason motivation or not reasons or not there are a vast and unfortunate realm of actions that can never be anything other than black anyone who thinks otherwise is either in denial or is afraid to really look closely at how common and pervasive it is in the world even today if it was your mother being slowly tortured by the tickler and then you best friend and then your brother and everyone else you knew the idea of its all grey would very quickly evaporatei have not read one thing that could exempt the white walkers from this category they may have some motivations for their actions but from whats on the page it falls pretty well into the take over the world by complete and utter death and destruction category where is the grey in that willful death and destruction are evil regardless of any possible motivations"

"sarah.jenice",2012-06-06,"my point is the other didnt attack first and we will never know if he would have they havent been overly aggressive or anything only the wights haveim sorry but i just cant agree with this with that rationale dont you need to take into consideration who is controlling the wights do the others just reanimate the wights and they just so happen to hunt down and kill people but thats not what the nonagressive others intended them to do maybe they should stop making wights if theyre out of control and killing innocent peoplei dont know how accurate old nans stories were but she tells bran that during the long night the others killed everything with hot blood in its veins maybe they do have motives or reasons for it like any of the armies in westeros have for killing their enemies but i dont see them as leaving anyone alone who doesnt try to fight them when theyve reanimated thousands of dead bodies that are killing people without discretion  like bran hodor meera and jojen who are all attacked with bran especially not being able to fight back and for some reason as gilly tells sam they can smellsense new life and thats why they come after her baby is that just a decision that the wights make or an order from their creators basically my point is that if the others truly dont want living beings dead they wouldnt be making wights who weve never seen let an innocent person go freeon the prologue of a game of thrones you are correct that ser waymar has his blade drawn but he is obviously frightened and he tells the other to stay where it is and from the way it reads the other walks up with a sword drawn so it doesnt seem like ser waymar has a choice for everyone who does not remember the book clearly below is an excerpt of the first time we see othersa game of thrones  page 7down below the lordling called out suddenly who goes there will heard uncertainty in the challenge he stopped climbing he listened he watched the woods gave answer the rustle of leaves the icy rush of the stream a distant hoot of a snowy owl the others made no sound will saw movement from the corner of his eye pale shapes gliding through the wood description of the woodswill where are you ser waymar called up can you see anything he was turning in a slow circle suddenly wary his sword in his hand he must have felt them as will felt them there was nothing to see answer me why is it so colda shadow emerged from the dark of the wood it stood in front of royce tall it was gaunt and hard as old bones with flesh as pale as milk description of its armor will heard the breath come out of ser waymar royce in a long hiss come no farther the lordling warned his voice cracked like a boys he threw the long sable cloak over his shoulders to free his arms for battle and took his sword in both hands the wind had stopped it was very cold the other slid forward on silent feet in its hand was a longsword like will had never seen no human metal had gone into the forging of that blade it was alive with moonlight translucent a shard of crystal so thin that it seemed to almost vanish when seen edgeon there was a faint blue shimmer to the thing a ghost light that played around its edges and somehow will knew it was sharper than any razor ser waymar met him bravely dance with me then he lifted his sword high over his head defiant his hands trembled from the weight of it or perhaps from the cold yet in that moment will thought he was a boy no longer but a man of the nights watch the other halted will saw its eyes blue deeper and bluer than any human eyes blue that burned like ice they fixed on the longsword trembling on high watched the moonlight running cold along the metal for a heartbeat he dared hope they emerged silently from the shadows twins to the first three of themfourfiveser waymar may have felt the cold that came with them but he never saw them never heard them the pale sword came shivering through the air ser waymar met it with steel when the blades met there was no ring of metal on metal only a high thin sound at the edge of hearing like an animal screaming in pain royce checked a second blow and a third then fell back a step another fury of blows and he fell back again behind him to right to left all around him the watchers stood patient faceless silent the shifting patterns of their delicate armor making them all but invisible in the wood yet they made no move to interfere again and again their swords met until will wanted to cover his ears against the strange anguished keening of their clash ser waymar was panting from the effort now his breath steaming in the moonlight his blade was white with frost the others danced with pale blue lightthen royces parry came a beat too late the pale sword bit through the ringmail beneath his arm the young lord cried out in pain blood welled between the rings it steamed in the cold and the droplets seemed red as fire where they touched the snow ser waymars fingers brushed his side his moleskin glove came away soaked with red the other said something in a language will did not know his voice was like the cracking of ice on a winter lake and the words were mocking ser waymar royce found his fury for robert he shouted and came up snarling lifting the frost covered longsword with both hands and swinging it around in a flat sidearm slash with all his weight behind it the others parry was almost lazy when the blades touched the steel shattereda scream echoed through the forest night and the longsword shivered into a hundred brittle pieces the shards scattering like a rain of needles royce went to his knees shrieking and covered his eyes blood welled between his fingers the watchers moved forward together as if some signal had been given swords rose and fell all in a deathly silence it was cold butchery the pale blades sliced through ringmail as if it was silk will closed his eyes far beneath him he heard their voices and laughter

"daimonionen",2012-06-06,"maybe the ww have personalities some many probably would just kill sam then and there but this particular guy chose not to because he thought sam too pathetic to be worth it then when hes all like ataaaack the whights might be too focused on the goal ahead to pay any attention to him and he is halfway hiding behind that rock"
"Thunderfist",2012-06-06,"sam probably pissed himself and the ww just thought damn thats nasty lets just keep on walking"
"AndrAs Garcia",2012-06-06,"the scene ends before we see them leave sam alone so why are we assuming they leave him alone watch the scene again closely the camera travels back as it reveals a crowd of others slowly moving forwards but the white walker who actually found sam isnt moving hes standing still right next to the rock that sam was hiding behind im not saying the writers didnt screw up but theres no reason to think they did quite yet next season we might find out that the white walker did approach sam and that he then slayed it with his dragon glass dagger becoming sam the slayer how does he escape the rest of them i dont know lets wait and see thats why they call it a cliffhanger edited by andras garcia 06 june 2012  0415 pm"

"HouseLark",2012-06-07,"ok rather than go for the dragonglassgarlickryptonite theory i had another thought assume for a minute that the white walkers are intelligent and not just mindless killing machines in the two white walker attacks that weve seen so far they have left a person alive despite clearly having the opportunity to kill them both times it has been a rather craven person that they have left alive my theory is that the white walkers are leaving these people alive almost as heralds they are allowed to live so that they can spread tales that will instil fear in the people of westeros its something that happens a lot in war someone is often left alive to bear witness to the power of an enemy its an intimidation tactic that can scatter and demoralise enemies before a bullet is fired or in this case a sword is sung the walkers each time may have left alive the most obviously craven individual as these pose no threat to the walkers"

"Horus Ex Machina",2012-06-07,"this was my biggest gripe about the finale it really killed off any awesomeness the ending had sam just sitting there surrounded by wights and white walkers and having them look at him and then just scream and keep marching totally lamei actually just think it was poor direction sam is behind a boulder and they make it look like theyre side by side but when you see the screen pan out theyre back on the other side of that boulder i dont think theyve actually seen him though they make it appear that they have poor direction i would have been happier if theyd have ended the episode and the season with the hazy images that we get right after panning up from sam panting behind the rock but i guess they wanted one massive cgi shot to echo last seasons finalepersonally i think the anticipation would have been much more enticing edited by horus bergeron 07 june 2012  0637 pm"

"Jayce",2012-06-08,"in the books the others attack armed people who attack them in that scene sam was neither armed that i could see nor did he attack he bowed his head which kind of looked like a sign of deference or respect though we know it was out of fear"

"Sam with Hooters",2012-06-08,"johnnyturbo wrotethe only issue with the dragonglass theory which i think is currently the most plausible is that i dont think wights are vulnerable to dragonglass so unless they changed that in the show or something thered be no reason for the wights to not go after himi have a sneaking suspicion  with absolutely no evidence to back it up  that once sam kills both ww with dragonglass the wights will collapse reverting from undead to normaldead without wws nearby to control themanother reason the ww might not kill sam even if it saw him is that it seems to be in a terrible hurry not the best thing when your army is composed of shambling zombies this particular ww may be a special individual resistant to sunlight  the other ww in the scene is covered up completely in wildlingstyle armor including a hood and carrying a crystal swordthey may well be planning to time the hordes arrival for after nightfall when theyd have a clear advantage over the humans anyway"

"Peasant Rebel Leader",2012-06-04,"it was always clear to me that the book sequence was very unlikely to be seen on the show all the ambiguity is lost if we see it through our own eyes and not through dany describing it besides that it would have been quite a lot of work for them to recreate all the visions i think they did a good job with their budget making the house creepy and all it was a bit desolate and everything but i guess thats true for the whole qarth arc they couldve done quite a lot more had they had more screen time although i gotta say the camera tricks were repeated a bit too often for me after dany walking around the tower they do the same with jaqen not actually vanishing but moving outside the camera range and then being gone well going back to my thoughts above did anyone get the feeling that they could have set up a scene with arstanselmy in season 3 when she learns his real name and i guess she will sooner works better on tv she can ask him about her father and oldest brother and she can ask him about the visions in the rooms which happened between the scenes we had in this episode might be a good way of getting a bit of exposition rolling sorry if i am repeating any point here"
"Wolfmage",2012-06-04,"hotu was pretty cool i liked how they made the link between magic and the dragons such an explicit plot point quaithe makes such an observation about that street firemage and we know its generally true across westeros so it makes total sense that pyat pree and the other qarth warlocks having already felt their power suddenly grow manifold just by the presence of the dragons and dany now lust to keep her and the dragons as close as possible this takes something that was a background allusion in the books ie the contrast from the initial dismissiveness towards the eccentric palace of dust and the evident powers in the hotu and other ominous lights posthotu and makes it explicit very clever didnt mind the lack of prophesies though i wasnt sure whether we were meant to think the iron throne and drogo were temptations in her path or simply illusory foreshadowing at first i thought they might be traps that said i thought danys drakaris moment was a little underwhelming in the end would have liked it to be a might more forceful and perhaps see the tower itself on fire but i guess they are saving some of that kind of drama for astapor edited by wolfmage 04 june 2012  0919 pm"

"ExileOnDaytonStreet",2013-01-21,"while i get and understand the nerd rage associated with changes to storylines in the book and im not going to pretend like the where are my dragons portion of the qarth storyline went as well as it could have i offer this challenge to you given the amount of time spent on dany from say garden of bones onwards what would you change about the story keep in mind that budget and time are a factor if you spend more time on the story what do you remove from another storyline if you elaborate more on the hotu scene how would you trim the budget elsewhere in the series to pay for it for me i suppose that im good without the undying ones themselves and having pyat pree take their place kind of like making baelish the brothel owner in season 1 i think this simplifies things for a story that can only take up a fraction of the time in the season as much as i dont like cutting stuff like that it keeps things simple and streamlined likewise i dont like how several unexpected people get killed off irri silver rakharo etc but i like that it makes dany feel alone and without options similarly i also kind of like how her relationship with xaro and the spice king is changed from the books because 1 it sort of consolidates the thirteen the guild of spicers the pureborn etc and 2 i actually kind of liked how her bargaining scenes played out with xaro and the spice king honestly my only problems with it were that the whole where are my dragons bit was just childish and silly i wonder how much of a role that whole kidnapped dragons really needed to play in getting dany to the hotu and eventually out of qarth and then we get to the house of the undying i agree that there shouldve been more here if only because we missed out on some really trippy avant garde kind of visuals that would be required to show some of this stuff without getting too spoilery although i will concede that quaithe can still help fill in some of these gaps as the series goes on my solution simple end season 2 with either the dragon kidnapping if that must be kept or the murder of the 13 by pyat and xaro i really do secretly like this change and just devote more time to the house of undying in the beginning of season 3 ive never felt like danys story advances too far in the next three books theres a lot there that can be consolidated and moved around especially since we really dont have to worry about her storyline crossing over with anyone elses for perhaps three more seasons depending on how the books are adapted i know the next two seasons will be asos but who knows what theyll do with affc and adod so why not give ourselves a huge event in the beginning of the third season otherwise were mostly left with the nights watch scandals north of the wall and maybe a little bit of action in robb starks camp and most of the other big moments wont happen until the end of season 3 or season 4 this gives us more time and effects money since with gots success im sure their budget from hbo is getting bigger each year for now to devote to the hotu and we can add a few more prophecy items like the blue flower and prince rhaegar etc in all honesty im not sure why they wouldnt do that they already moved arstan to not show up until season 3 of course the other side of the token might be that prophesies dont work as well on tv as they do on the written page and maybe all of our nerd rage is over something that nonreaders just wouldnt respond to and the flow of the tv series would suffer for it edited by exileondaytonstreet 21 january 2013  0624 pm"
"Im With Stannis",2013-02-05,"i think people need to cut the producers some slack i mean there are budget and time restraints that im sure prevented them from getting everything they wanted in the scene plus most of the visions are not really that vital to the storyline and take away some of the element of surprise for future events why allude to the red wedding when you could just watch it unfold later on i think they just didnt want any nonbook readers to figure things out that are meant to be shocking when they happen point is they are just unnecessary and would cost a lot of money to recreate the only one i could see as being slightly more important is the rhaegareliaaegon one and that one would just confuse nonbook readers since the show really doesnt really go into much detail about themas for the three betrayals and such i actually do think those are pretty important to storyline and should be included however those can easily be added in next season so i refuse to be annoyed by their absence until we see if they are brought up next season although if season 3 rolls around and the three betrayals are not included i will be really mad because of the part they play in danys treatment of jorah without them danys decision will come off as being super harshyeah they really need to fit in aegon and rheagar background somewhere before he shows up suddenly in adwd i dont see how they could have this character suddenly appear and the audience is going to know who that is they have to elaborate on this story within the next 2 seasons whether its a dream sequence dany has or whatever looking back im not all that disappointed in the shows hou i for one thought the scene bt drogo and rheago was moving the throne room scene gives a lot away to the viewers and readers looks like the white walkers will reach kings landing at least and rewatching the episode again i think even bigger foreshadowing is given to us from the stannis scene happening shortly after stannis sits on the throne somehow someway i also think tvonly fans have the memory of a cat everyone i talked to that watched the show but not read the books never remember how robert got in power in the first place or why most of them are so caught up in neds death and brans crippling they are missing the bigger picture to some extent i think its intentional on dds part but as new characters come they will have to fill in the blanks at some point"

"Sr.DavosSeaworth",2012-06-04,"see i am not overly disturbed by the scene stannis has always been prepared to do whatever is necessary to take the iron throne not because he wants it but because it is his duty if he has to kill renly or cortnay or be the first off the boats on the blackwater or sacrifice edric he will do it the lines about betraying everyone are reminding the audience of that i think that there is not a great deal of difference between book stannis and hbo stannis"

"Prince of Dragonstone",2012-06-05,"until the end of asos when he saved the nights watch i loathed stannis and thought him an evil dark magic using kinslayer i was rooting for renly and really despised stannis for killing him it felt cheap and dirty it really wasnt until adwd that i started to warm up to him the point is i think many viewers of the show will go through this same evolution with stannis as well he was depicted as a sort of detestable character in acok and the majority of asos i predict many show fans will hate him even more if they go through with the edric storm story arc for him to allow melisandre to sacrifice an innocent boy will be very damning for him i hope they keep this because its so important in showing how great of a man davos is without edric davos wont have much to do in s3"
"Tenlaar",2012-06-05,"i am not too fond of show stannis at this point the way i have always thought of the baratheons is different kinds of metal robert was bronze he was crude he could open your belly as easily as any other metal but he was maleable renly was gold all flash and sparkles looked great and all the ladies and half the lads wanted to wear him but his greatest asset was just charm stannis is iron he is unflinching unyielding and generally not so pretty to look at but when it really hits the fan you want iron in your hand i am just not seeing the man who puts honor and justice above all else especially his own feelings about the subject throughout reading the books i have just never pictured stannis as being one to lash out in petty violent ways especially while pleading for something at the same time and especially especially not against a woman"
"Terilien",2012-06-05,"actually no stannis was compared to iron yes but with the implication that iron while hard is also brittle and breaks before it bends"
"Tenlaar",2012-06-05,"breaks before it bends certainly brittle not even close"
"Baelor Blackfyre",2012-06-05,"i enjoyed the scene for the same reason i enjoyed some of the added theon scenes this season such as him burning the letter to robb their added insights into these characters revealing parts of them we dont get to see in the books but expect to be there we never get to see stannis be conflicted about melisandre or see theon conflicted about betraying robb"
"Bambi",2012-06-05,"i enjoyed the beginning of the scene and i hated the ending of it seriously staring into the flames but not showing anything it is television if i wanted my mind to do the job instead of the shows visuality i read the books ok budget yeah i know but it was purely done"
"StarkWard",2012-06-05,"breaks before it bends certainly brittle not even closethats how donal noye described the baratheons in acokrobert  the true steelstannis  iron brittle will break before he bendsrenly  copper shiny and bright not worth much at days endalso i dont think mels you will betray lines makes stannis seem more evil if anything it made him more pitiful here is a man who will suffer for what he believes is right strangely enough i associated him with theon who is loved by no one for doing his duty"
"Lady Meera Reed",2012-06-05,"this scene really pissed me off davos was the one thinking about strangling mel for his sons asos and stannis has a lot of flaws but violence against women is not one of them that is roberts forte not stannis whos actually yknowthe guy who despised roberts flaws"
"Ghost714",2012-06-05,"i hated this scene stannis no matter how angry i can not see strangling a woman everybody keeps saying stannis deserved to be angry because melisandre told him he would win if he listened to her and it was all a lie if that were the case then it might justify stanniss manhandling of mel but that was not the case stanniss defeat was his own fault melisandre had delivered on her part all the way up until stannis left her behind at dragonstone she promised him victory if she was at his side but that promise was moot the second he desided to leave her behind for his own pride because he did not want men to call it her victory then i hated the whole gazing into the fire crap first off it seemed incredibly cheap them looking into a little lamp they should have gazed into a hearth fire if anything secondly they have been trying to make stannis look like melisandres little puppet all season making him look evil because she is evil when in the books neither of them are evil imo and stannis was not mels puppet they both used and played off of each other not in a manipulative way i know thats what we think at first in the books but the show is being way to heavy handed with thismaking them both look evil and making stannis dance for the evil puppet master i am afraid that when they want to show these two characters as not being evil in the future like they should people wont buy it because the show has made them to evil the face turn wont be believable to me the show made it seem like stannis was breaking free of the evil witches hold and then she reeled him back in by making him stare into the entrancing fire i really hope i am wrong and i hope stannis saw the fist of the first men like in the books i just have so much doubt because dd really think stannis is bad and its been showing all season in their writing of stannis imo just like dd have made arya and tyrion to good i can very easily see them continuing to make stannis more bad than he is in the books if you can even call what he does in the books bad i hope people get what i am saying last but not least i hated how they totally made mel look like the evil little demon standing on stanniss shoulder and whispering in to his ear thats completely original dd you are so very clever"
"Lord Varys",2012-06-05,"stannis does not allow his men to rape women and gelds them if he catches them doing it because its against the law this does not mean however that stannis does not chastise the women of his household but i dont see him using violence on them although its plain that he does not like them very much but when he strangled mel he was not so much into i like abusing womenmode but he was trying to make a philosophical point your god has no apparently no power at all woman else i could not kill you right then and there he only backs down when he realizes that melisandre and her belief that he is the chosen one of her god are still his only hope left to succeed stannis is a pragmatist killing mel then and there would have gained him nothing with her there is still some small hope left that he is going to win"

"ChromeWeasel",2012-06-05,"stannis is really pissed off in this scene he really did everything what mel asked of him and he still did not got what he wanted so he has every reason to be angry and mel being subservient to him and not trying to fight for her life she could have easily killed him then and there from what was revealed in adwd just underlines that she really thinks he is rhllors chosen onewhat was revealed in any of the books that suggests mel could kill stannis before he throttles her to death"

"Sister Goldenhair",2012-06-06,"i think im of the same mind as many people here i enjoyed season 2 i thought it was fantastic tv but one of my gripes has been the characterization of stannis the show gives the impression that hes lusting after the iron throne and the books give the obverse view of it in that he believes it is his duty to be king there were some changes i liked stannis going up the ladder and fighting was one but overall i think this season didnt spend enough time with him and he came off looking like a villainnow with melisandre shes coming off as being a traditional witch that enchants the ruler of a realm instead of religious fanatic who truely believes that stannis needs to be king i cant remember the context i cant remember which book but theres a line she says that i think is very revealing about her true nature in effect she says do you think i would travel half way around the world to put another king on a throne obviously not verbatim but i think that melisandre is the one that should be built up instead of the strictly manipulative one weve been givenmelisandre also says something in the nature of that shes been fighting these battle much longer than stannis can even imagine meaning she is very old older than a normal humanwitch would be and of course the stoneglamour she wears covers who she really is"

"Associate Maester",2012-06-07,"stannis is my favorite character from the books and mel is definitely in the top five i didnt have an issue the choking scene at all weve got two separate canons going on books and television show that scene made sense to me for the way theyve handled stannis on the show i dont equate it to poor writing just different choices im not upset at the choices the producers have made for any of the characters personally edited by dreadfort81 07 june 2012  0802 pm"
"Istakhr",2012-06-07,"i found mels response to choking more interesting she didnt try to stop stannis nor did she coughed or breathed hard after the choking i think it was interestingly ambiguos if she can even be choked to death"
"Arbor Gold I'm Sold",2012-06-07,"exactly right good generals avoid putting themselves in a position where there are surprised by an attack in the rear by scouting the enemy in one or many ways bad generals fling caution to the wind as if they were undefeatable in the case where they are surprised only superior morale and tactics may win the day stannis army displayed none of thatalso the point is that with the weak defensive force at kl stannis should have taken the city and been defending from the battlements by the time renlys ghost appears"
"Arbor Gold I'm Sold",2012-06-07,"nobody knew about the tyrellsstannis will get the blame but its not technically his fault itll go down as a loss for him but it wasnt his hands on command that caused the problem ser imry made a mistake that screwed stannis with his pants onbut still nobody knew about the tyrells they came full force and nobody expected themhe should have already been in the castle defending from the walls of kl crushing the tyrell and tywins army he failed to take a poorly manned castle in any timely fashion so another army showed up to crush him"
"Arbor Gold I'm Sold",2012-06-07,"the tyrells were at bitterbridge and got contacted by littlefinger they then joined up with tywin lannister it was by pure luck they reached stannis in timesame as earlier posts it wasnt pure luck that tywin reached kl in time it was the fact that a small defensive force and tyrions plan stalled stannis enough for them to arrive if stannis doesnt make all the mistakes that he does the city is taken and tywin is too late"
"Lord Wadsworth",2012-06-07,"there was far more wildfire than they could have accounted for the wildfire and chain combination wreaked havoc they learned about the chain as they were going up the river capturing fishing vessels tyrell force would have been cut drastically had his envoys succeeded tywin wouldnt have gotten the message had edmure not charged at him and stopped him all in all had there not been massive wildfire and poor luck in regards to tywin and the tyrells showing up stannis would have taken kings landing easily stannis mistake is appoting ser imry but thats only a mistake because of ser imrys overconfidence everything else is due to unpredictableness from external factors magic edmure loras"

"Arbor Gold I'm Sold",2012-06-08,"so many people trying to make stannis the only king to show at the wall as him being such a friend to the realm and that he was the only one that cared so i guess you all read some secret chapter that i didnt get about how stannis was sending all these people to fight at the wall all these years with the way some of you are making it sound surely stannis was sending quality fighters to the wall constantly to help defend the realm half the nightswatch must have been sent from dragonstone right"

"Lord Wadsworth",2012-06-08,"stannis is currently the only one going to the wall to do anything the nights watch hasnt been a big deal for a long time now yknow snarks and grumkins it is a power play to a point him being the only king to actually respond to their summons shows hes for the realm rather than just the throne mel also showed the fist in the fire so hes working towards that end as well nobody knew about stannis shadow assassin most everyone blamed brienne or catelyn because they knew stannis didnt have the coin for a faceless man so really it was bad luck that they decided to group up stannis also tried to wrest the majority of the bitterbridge forces to his side but his envoys got captured so yeah i attribute a good bit of it to bad luck the tyrell alliance edmures folly and the magic in the world allowing for far more wildfire to be made"
"Rockroi",2012-06-08,"this is a tough topic for me and for many reasons not least of which is that stannis remains one of my favorite characters <U+0080><U+0093> behind only jaime and tyrion and tyrion fell a ways after dwd the first post i ever made on the old ez boards the forerunner to this cite was on stannis why did stannis choose robert over aerys i said that it was because of renly i think that marton<U+0080><U+0099>s craft is extremely underrated no more so in how martin has exquisitely balanced stannis between <U+0080><U+009C>determined monster<U+0080><U+009D> and righteous antiherothe show grazes but never embraces this texture instead stannis is an amalgam of contradictions it tries to show stannis as in thrall to a sorceress but to a woman who when faced with her own strangulation does not so much as raise a finger against him but still monstrous in his aims it shows a stannis determined enough to try to swallow the iron throne but not focused enough to see mal<U+0080><U+0099>s aims it wants stannis to be <U+0080><U+009C>just<U+0080><U+009D> but crazed enough to want to kill mal stannis who hates adultery but fucks mal a stannis who is cold and practical and yet believes in sorcery fantasies and fireviewing<U+0080>and yet<U+0080> maybe it<U+0080><U+0099>s the actor maybe it<U+0080><U+0099>s his discussions with davos criminally underrated in the books and in the show maybe its because the world does seem really out to get him maybe its because he<U+0080><U+0099>s the only character who was feared and hated before we ever saw him<U+0080> and yet its workingi want to address some of the issues other boarders have brought up and just to state that i think that everyone has brought some good thoughts to this discussion but i think stannis deserves a proper defensein my imho that was pathetic stannis is supposed to represent determinationto the point of stuborness at times having him mop around about renlysomeone that declared himself as a enemy of stannis is just absurdwhile i agree that stannis represents determination i disagree that that trait is somehow immune to regret stannis lamented renly<U+0080><U+0099>s death even in the books he says in clash <U+0080><U+009C>i grieve for him renly as well for the boy he was not the man he grew to be<U+0080><U+009D> martin george rr 20030101 a game of thronesa clash of kings kindle location 22746 bantam kindle editionbut moreso<U+0080><U+009C>renly offered me a peach at our parley mocked me defied me threatened me and offered me a peach i thought he was drawing a blade and went for mine own was that his purpose to make me show fear or was it one of his pointless jests when he spoke of how sweet the peach was did his words have some hidden meaning<U+0080><U+009D> the king gave a shake of his head like a dog shaking a rabbit to snap its neck <U+0080><U+009C>only renly could vex me so with a piece of fruit he brought his doom on himself with his treason but i did love him davos i know that now i swear i will go to my grave thinking of my brother<U+0080><U+0099>s peach<U+0080><U+009D> martin george rr 20030101 a game of thronesa clash of kings kindle locations 2276522770 bantam kindle editionthere can be little if any doubt that even in the moments after renly<U+0080><U+0099>s death stannis felt remorse that does not mean that stannis does not approve his own actions just that he does not feel good and maybe feels even a little sad <U+0080><U+0093>from doing ittv viewers will see stannis from now on as a villain and that seem to be the intent of the show producers i personally dont really care about stannismelisandre storyline from now on they coulld just have died in blackwater battle for all i carewell for starters there is a reason stannis did not die it should be noted that martin wrote the very episode wherein stannis very well could have died had his role not been so critical further seeing someone as a villain is one thing being an actual villain is quite another after all movies and tv shows are built on claiming the maliciousness of one character when in fact that character could very well be viewed as the hero this is very true in <U+0080><U+009C>unforgiven<U+0080><U+009D> in the character of little bill daggett and in the tv show deadwood in the character of al swearengen you can call stannis a villain but if he does good things<U+0080><U+0080> well can<U+0080><U+0099>t the viewer be just as wrong as renly and varys who claim that stannis is this fearsome leviathan who will do untold destruction to all i mean isn<U+0080><U+0099>t it interesting that stannis a <U+0080><U+009C>rule of law<U+0080><U+009D> man if there ever was one is seen as a monster when he is in many ways the most humane of all the leaders he doesn<U+0080><U+0099>t opt out of marriage contracts robb he does not needlessly throw his men away on long marches tywin he does not inflict unwarranted cruelty joff he does not see war as a silly game renlyin other words if this be it the villain<U+0080> won<U+0080><U+0099>t his ascension to hero be all the more <U+0080> extraordinary to the viewers if the producers say stannis would make a bad king does that make him a bad guy in fact from what we have seen from ned stark<U+0080><U+0099>s horrifying handship isn<U+0080><U+0099>t it up to the audience to decide how well good men would do when there is a <U+0080><U+009C>bad man<U+0080><U+009D> in stannis who could and would do betterand finally if stannis is a villian can we think of a more honorable and just onethe show gives the impression that hes lusting after the iron throne and the books give the obverse view of it in that he believes it is his duty to be king there were some changes i liked stannis going up the ladder and fighting was one but overall i think this season didnt spend enough time with him and he came off looking like a villaini have already addressed the villainy angle however an astute observer will note that stannis never says he <U+0080><U+009C>wants<U+0080><U+009D> the throne he is the king and i believe he says as much once in the show stannis is the king and he acts like that joff et al are abominations of incest he says as much therefore its not that stannis is this horrible usurper he is in the eyes of the lannisters its that he is making a claim and that may appear selfish but appearances are not the whole story now with melisandre shes coming off as being a traditional witch that enchants the ruler of a realm instead of religious fanatic who truely believes that stannis needs to be king ii disagree for starters if stannis were in her thrall stannis would not have dismissed her to dragonstone prior to the battle at davos request 9unless of course you believe stannis is also in davos thrall if stannis were in her thrall he could never have been that hardcore lannisterkilling motherfucker who was the first off the boats first on the beach first up the walls first inside the castle last guy to stop fighting and then there is the choke scene if sannis was in her thrall why did she not beg him plead with him order him to stop choking her why does she say <U+0080><U+009C>we killed renly<U+0080><U+009D> when an appeal to his vanity would have served how come she does not so much as raise a finger to defend herself from stannis<U+0080><U+0099> choke knowing that he is more than capable of killing herthat<U+0080><U+0099>s not what the puppeteer would do with their puppet i think the producers are creating a far more complex relationship here far more reflective of the bookscant remember the context i cant remember which book but theres a line she says that i think is very revealing about her true nature in effect she says do you think i would travel half way around the world to put another king on a throne obviously not verbatim but i think that melisandre is the one that should be built up instead of the strictly manipulative one weve been givenbut remember she says that in dance with dragons book five we just got done with book 2 in other words it takes time to scoop up this relationship it took us five books to finally get into mal<U+0080><U+0099>s head through her first and only pov the show deserves the same exact accommodation you ave the books<U+0080> time time for her to truly reveal herself time for stannis to grow on the audience just like he grew on all of us and the northern hill tribes it should be stated time for people to understand him just as we understood ned and robbtime it<U+0080><U+0099>s the one resource we cannot just make more of give it timei always read that stannis was willing to do anything and everything to get the throne but that he cannot admit to himself that he really just wants itno here is what stannis has said on the subject in the books<U+0080><U+009C>why would you want it then<U+0080><U+009D> davos asked him<U+0080><U+009C>it is not a question of wanting the throne is mine as robert<U+0080><U+0099>s heir that is law after me it must pass to my daughter unless selyse should finally give me a son<U+0080><U+009D> he ran three fingers lightly down the table over the layers of smooth hard varnish dark with age <U+0080><U+009C>i am king wants do not enter into it i have a duty to my daughter to the realm even to robert he loved me but little i know yet he was my brother the lannister woman gave him horns and made a motley fool of him she may have murdered him as well as she murdered jon arryn and ned stark for such crimes there must be justice starting with cersei and her abominations but only starting i mean to scour that court clean as robert should have done after the trident martin george rr 20030304 a storm of swords a song of ice and fire book three pp 410411 bantam kindle editionthis is of critical importance stannis says that wanting has nothing to do with him being king yes stannis probably does want to be king who wouldn<U+0080><U+0099>t but that the want has no factor in his decision to make his claim its justice it<U+0080><U+0099>s the law stannis believes in justice and the rule of law not in <U+0080><U+009C>might makes right<U+0080><U+009D> robert died without legal issue hence stannis is king and he goes where the law dictatesis he willing to do horrid things like say murder renly yes but he does not do other things he will not follow ser axell<U+0080><U+0099>s plan of attacking claw isle and bringing fiery retribution on the fiefdom of lord celtigar he does not kill any traitors who swear fealty to him he pardons wildings and traitors alikein other words there is a line and stannis knows where it isit really shows that stannis is doing something not just whining about what a bunch of traitors everybody except davos isagain in stannis<U+0080><U+0099> defense this is the result of two things first there being an exceptional amount of traitors in westeros anyone not for stannis is by definition a traitor and second the fact that after blackwater he does become rather impotent and its in spite of this impotence and not because of it that he attacks the wall which sort of torpedoes any theory that stannis does not act with others in mind if stannis was not thinking of the realm why defend itstannis only backs down when he realizes that melisandre and her belief that he is the chosen one of her god are still his only hope left to succeedyou don<U+0080><U+0099>t know that at all it could just as easily be that stannis does not want to kill mel because it would be a horrible act of cruelty barbarism and evili dont know what gets me more upset  that stannis has turned into unlikeable robert 20 or that fans actually like thatwell for starters they are brothers so some common traits would be expectedbut he<U+0080><U+0099>s not like robert unlike robert stannis is a serious ruler unlike robert stannis actually listens to wise counsel unlike robert stannis is not in the thrall of a woman or her powerful family stannis is not blind to the limits of others stannis is not a slob or a brute stannis does not brook any deception and always demands justice even if he chops off the fingers of the man who saved his men and his wife robert did nothing like this to varys pycelle selmy or of course jaime stannis is <U+0080><U+009C>a serious man<U+0080><U+009D> while robert was a foolim still very upset about stannis choking melisandre stannis is not impulsive and violent nothing ever hinted that in the books that is what robert would do not stannisin the books its described as follows<U+0080><U+009C>after the battle when i was lost to despair the lady melisandre bid me gaze into the hearthfire<U+0080><U+009D> martin george rr 20030304 a storm of swords a song of ice and fire book three p 414 bantam kindle editionso stannis admits to be in despair which is clearly what he was suffering in that scene in ep 10the problem here is that for the purpose of showing something that should be clear right from the start stannis is not being manipulated they are changing some of his character traits making him act just like the brother he despises and complains aboutno they are not they are simply illuminating different facets of the relationship its not a change again in book two it was <U+0080><U+009C>hit or miss<U+0080><U+009D> as to what stannis and mel<U+0080><U+0099>s relationship was its only through time that we can learn morelet me ask you this its noightime and you see what you think is a large hill off in the distance however as night changes to day you realie that the hill was actually another house does this mean the hill changed into a house no it means thatwhat you thought was a hill was actually a house same with stannis and mel if stannis is not in thrall with mel then is that changing the story or is it revealng the storyyour description of stannis military prowess reminds me of sir robin who nearly defeated the chicken of bristol he was a minor general in roberts great rebellion he crushed the most powerful fleet that was done by stark etc at pyke he lost the sea and land battle at kl his one triumph in got the books was when he surprised a disorganized army of wildlings and defeated them with an organized force the same way the night watch had done for 1000 years before they lost nearly all their strength i would not put my faith in stannis to defeat the lannisters in a fair fight the starks or even his effete brothernone of this is true none of it is believed by the characters in the books which is more importantstannis held storm<U+0080><U+0099>s end when it should have fallen you calim that this was <U+0080><U+009C>minor<U+0080><U+009D> and yet we have seen what losing one<U+0080><U+0099>s seat of power does to a rebel leader<U+0080><U+0099>s effectiveness once robb lost winterfell his head followed the tyrells are so petrified and resentful of stannis for this that to this day they all despise himstannis destroyed the ironborn navy a feat the royal navy and the lannister navy could not accomplish nearly ten years afterthefact victarion greyjoy is still mortified at how stannis crushed himstannis only lost the land and sea battle at blackwater rush with a combined effort of tyrion tywin highgarden the entire west and aerys targaryen<U+0080><U+0099>s forgotten wildfire not since voltron has more come together to defeat somethingyou said that the night<U+0080><U+0099>s watch had been defeating wildings ofr 1000s of years<U+0080> hmmm<U+0080> funny because they seemed close to getting overrun before stannis showed up if they could have defeated mace how come they didn<U+0080><U+0099>t and stannis<U+0080><U+0099> feat must be remembered in the context what other military leader could have pulled off such a logistical and tactical marvel just a few weeks removed from such a horrible defeatyou then neglect to mention stannis<U+0080><U+0099> ability to unikte the northern tribes his capture of deepwood motte nor his march on winterfelland you also neglect to mention that every single major military leader is scared shitless of stannis varys says as much to ned tywin says as much to tyrion cersei says as much to sansa and tyrion they knowi would say stannis has the best chance to defeat stark and lannister alikestannis wouldnt make a good king i thought it was not so subtle that if you put stannis best characteristics with renlys best characteristics you would have a good kingi don<U+0080><U+0099>t see this at all because that was robert and robert was an absolutely horrible king this cannot be stressed enough robert was such a fucking terrible king that the moment after he died the realm blew apart at the seems stannis is not the ruler robert was not the king renly would have been both enthralled to more powerful houses lannister and tyrell stannis was not tethered to a more powerful faction hence part of the fear towards himexactly right good generals avoid putting themselves in a position where there are surprised by an attack in the rear by scouting the enemy in one or many ways bad generals fling caution to the wind as if they were undefeatable in the case where they are surprised only superior morale and tactics may win the day stannis army displayed none of thatwe actually do not know if stannis<U+0080><U+0099> scouts saw the approaching army and warned of this once they could stannis<U+0080><U+0099> attack was rapid he made a lot happen in a very short time its very possible that he did have a rear guard and scouts and they did warn him but by then it was far too late we are never told when the hammer blow did finally fall it was so overwhelming that satnnis forces were in no position to defend despite any plea to discipline and morale prior to that stannis forces displayed tremenndous amounts of nboth the troops stayed true and in control after the wildfire and after ships started exploding going so far as to use ships as bridges in order to take the cityalso at the time blackwater started the tyrell<U+0080><U+0099>s were nowhere to be found and tywin was in the riverlands a rear guard or scouts were probably not thinking about that type of combination and onslaught the reader certainly was not was possible the fact that they combined to take him down does not make stannis a bad general it just means he cannot predict the futurehe wants to kill an innocent child edric storm davos then convinces him to instead head to the wallstannis does not want to he fights it every step of the way and finally gives in<U+0080> right before davos talks him out of it in other words stannis listens to wise counselhe didnt go to the wall for the good of the realm he went to gain an army in the north so he could try again to gain the crownokay now its just devolved into bullshit this is simply not true stannis never orders or cajoles or even requests that any man not one single man <U+0080><U+0093>join him he does ask for jon snow to take winterfell<U+0080> which just makes sense given the fragmentation of the north and jon<U+0080> thinks about it long and hard hmmm<U+0080> i wonder whyhe<U+0080><U+0099>s in the north because the bad guys are in the north simple as that when we all know the real battle at the wall is coming what does stannis do he cant wait to get away from the wall to recruit an armynot entirely true jon snow wants him to go south as well and rescue the north from the clutches of bolton and ramsey and not be bothering him and for really good reason also stannis keeps his wife daughter and troops there along with<U+0080> mel<U+0080> wonder why if stannis was just going to rush all the south why leave everything there makes no sensebecause he<U+0080><U+0099>s coming backbank on itin the end the show has stannis riding a far more tenuous line and i agree with many parts of the prior critisism at the same time the story is not over the tale has not be fully told we need time time to see stannis growth and development his evolution and his adaptation stannis for all his faults is capable of true evolution something that other characters ned joff tywin robb cat viserys robert renly etc  were not able to embraceand thats why stannis is here and they are not give it time the  adaptation is not over edited by rockroi 08

winterfell<U+0080> which just makes sense given the fragmentation of the north and jon<U+0080> thinks about it long and hard hmmm<U+0080> i wonder whyhe<U+0080><U+0099>s in the north because the bad guys are in the north simple as thatnot entirely true jon snow wants him to go south as well and rescue the north from the clutches of bolton and ramsey and not be bothering him and for really good reason also stannis keeps his wife daughter and troops there along with<U+0080> mel<U+0080> wonder why if stannis was just going to rush all the south why leave everything there makes no sensebecause he<U+0080><U+0099>s coming backbank on itin the end the show has stannis riding a far more tenuous line and i agree with many parts of the prior critisism at the same time the story is not over the tale has not be fully told we need time time to see stannis growth and development his evolution and his adaptationwow i was trying to decide whether to read adwd again or your post haha just kidding all i can do is try to go line by line here so i hope you can stay with menot an insult just its a lot of material here you will have to refer to the quote above and i will try and answer for each line in turnhonorable or just onethe kinslayer is the most accursed of men so yea pretty much anyoneother than the mountain and jof then we have the puppet and in thrall with mel statements i do think mel could totally destroy stannis when he is choking her but she doesnt lift a finger to defend because she knows she can still manipulate him im not saying he is without his own thought and motivations but that she is manipulating what better way to show faith in your manipulation than not lifting a finger in your own self defense relying only on words do you think she has no way of defending herself what would a puppeteer do to a puppet if not this if she fights and kills him right then and there what does she have no puppet thats for sure i am just using your words here i dont believe he is an absolute puppet but she is doing a good job of getting him to do what she says for the most parthe doesnt go to claw island because it doesnt gain him the crown justice would dictate he goes there and deals with there treachery so if he was so just this would have to be done and he can do it without losing his armies so if his character was as you describe he would have to do it also in one sentence you are saying he has to kill his brother because he so just then a few sentences later you talk of his not killing traitors as long as they now become apart of his army so he is for the exact rule of law but as long as you stop being a traitor now and join him your pardoned i think you see here how much he has changed davos saved him and his wifes life but he still chops off his finger tips what has changed mel is in stannis life so when you speak of his character to me at least there is a big difference between stannis before mel and after clearly i think that is the evolution you are speaking of pre mel and post mel stannisnow we see that you explain that in spite of his impotence he goes to defend the realm at the wall you are intitled to your opinion of course but mine differs i would say that his army was crushed so he needs a new one where can he go to recruit men since he has few friends because of his lack of charisma or social skills or just his aspergerswhatever you want to call it the north of course where there king has been slain so i would say is impotence drives him to the wall so he can be seen as savior to the realm to gather the northmen to his cause if he always felt it was such a just cause he would have been sending men to the wall for years so all these years go by without one mention of all the men stannis is sending to protect the realm at the wall then what changed stannis got defeated and lost most of his armyi even disagree somewhat on robert being a horrible king i think he started out as a solid king but then it ruined and corrupted him as for the realm shattering as soon as he died thats not exactly the case jof is what did that the north didnt rise up in rebellion because robert baratheon died further more i think your point explains how important robert was as king him on the throne peace and all the men in westeros followed this and didnt rebel even though he just seemed to drink and whore his time there the realm prospered and obeyed the law so he was such a strong king noone would dare take up arms against him the greyjoys rebelled but isnt that what they do fight not farm so you say he was such a horrible king and that is why everything fell apart upon his death i say he was a solid king that held everything together while he was aliveso where are we at he stannis always demands justice even your own words dispel thishe pardons wildlings and traitors alikethen you try and defend that he has no rear guard sorry but in my mind if you arent protecting your flanks and rear that makes you a really sloppy general of course i have to throw in that if stannis made a lot happen in a short time he would have taken the poorly manned castle at kl its battle unless your plan is to starve out the enemy in the castle things happen fast this is just called warfare and i thought using the ships as bridges was pretty much stannis battle planchanged somewhat by wildfire then you are saying something about him not predicting the future clearly the tyrells were against him as well as tywin so not knowing where your enemies armies are does not make you a great commander knowing whether your enemies troops are within striking distance is important for any commander so if you call that predicting the future then every great commander hell even decent commander would have to know thisstannis is in the north because the bad guys are in the north simple as that your quote i dont think so bad guys as far as stannis is concerned are everywhere the only potential friendlies are in the north is more like it stannis doesnt ask for one single man stannis is going to take an army of wildlings with him to battle south of the wall is he not he gets talked out of this by snow who explains to him how he can gather up some northern tribes but that they will not except him with wildling amongst his troops he leaves his wife and daughter at the wall so they arent in the middle of all the forced marching and fighting he does the same at castle black his wife and daughter come later after the battle why couldnt they do the same this time so whether his plan is to come back to the wall and fight for the realm in the most important battle or to gain an army to make a run for the crown is yet to be unfolded if he is still alive of coursei am very appreciative of your post and dont want you to think i am attacking you just offering a different opinion edited by arbor gold im sold 08 june 2012  0825 pm"
"Arbor Gold I'm Sold",2012-06-08,"i didnt get in the quote of where you make it seem like stannis listens to wise council from davos concerning going to the wall versus killing edric storm he does take this wise council from davos agreed but you make it seem like he would just listen and take it even if edric was there the facts are he had decided to kill edric and would have done so had davos not shipped him out so yes he listens to wise council but only because he doesnt have much of a choice if edric would have still been at dragonstone stannis first would have killed him and if that didnt work maybe he would then listen to davos davos was giving him council the whole time to not do this he only listened when he didnt have much else for options edited by arbor gold im sold 08 june 2012  0831 pm"

"Arbor Gold I'm Sold",2012-06-08,"well no stannis helped hold the wall once his justification being the one given to davos save the realm to win the throne instead of win the throne to save the realm anything else really is a supposition given that weve yet to get a stannis pov in order to really understand his motives or reasoning for aiding the wall given the above as well as george rr martins conviction that the series title reminds us constantly that the real issue lies in the north beyond the wall i think its safe to say stannis actions were largely motivated by a real desire to save the realm not just to rally the northmen to his cause and continue the fight that is the heart of it isnt it save the realm to win the throne really what stannis did wasnt saving the realm by fighting the wildlings was it the wildlings werent going to crush westeros so even in this statement how else to take it other than its all about perception fight the wildlings at the wall so the north will rally to your causefor their perceived savior that and fighting back against pretenders in the north edited by arbor gold im sold 08 june 2012  1047 pm"

"Adelstein",2012-11-02,"well its worth bearing in mind that in book terms ned was only two or three years older than jaime and only about thirtyfive at the time of that fight by that point its unlikely his abilities would have seriously declined through old age he might be a little rusty but jaime is likely to be too neither of them has fought an actual battle for a while and both of them will have been sparring with competent mastersatarms its also entirely possible that jaime wasnt fighting to the best of his ability and was being more wary than normal hes always been a little wary of ned ever since that moment with the iron throne and hes aware that ned is experienced enough not to fall for something like the trick he used to take out jory he also has no experience of watching ned fight so doesnt know if ned has any particular favourite moves given a little longer i suspect jaime would have beaten him but going toe to toe for a few blows isnt too unrealistic i think although for what its worth i always liked the ambiguity of the books and how we cant assess neds capabilities because we never see him fight the duel with jaime kind of detracted from that but i can see why it was felt necessary for television obviously too screen ned is older than book ned but thats another adaptation issue like tvstannis in this context age means more experience as much as it means slower reflexes"

"Bearsblood8",2012-06-04,"when they completely change something major plot wise that compromises the over all story which would never happen as martin is heavily involved ill agree with you guys but the same things unfolding on screen in a slightly different way doesnt matter in the grand scheme of things robb will still be murdered jon will still become lord commander of the nights watch tyrion will still murder his father etc etcunder this logic asoiaf would be just as enjoyable to read of as a series of bullet points grrm could just lay out the plot points in a ten page list and we could check off the events as they occur to me its the world building around these poignant moments that matter in this sense the show has left behind various pieces of martins world this is to be expected because the show is an adaptation however i feel the shows attitude towards various points robbs choices robb and catelyns relationship revealing littlefingers support for sansa early white walkers ignoring sam all work to change the feel for the world that george created"

"Kernest",2012-06-04,"try and argue they didnt ruin jeyne westerlings character completelyi think they didnt westerlings arent really necessary to the story as long as robb married someone and rw happens before a heir is born to him in the books westerlings needed to be there to ensure robb doesnt have a child i think rw happening with a fresh bun in talisas oven would be even more powerful and as much as id like to see more of robb thatd be great television"
"sarah.jenice",2012-06-04,"i was bothered by this too if we are just referencing stuff said on the show in season 1 the greatjon makes his moving speech that declares robb the king in the north and goes through all of the things that make them different from the southron people what do they know of the wall or the wolfswood even their gods are wrong to me that makes it pretty clear that they do not worship the seven karstarks reference to giving his heart to the father if his sons could step out of their graves and walk into prison cells irritated me but robb and talisa saying all of the names of the seven just felt so wrong it does seem reasonable maybe that this was because talisa worships the seven or there were no heart trees or maybe that because robb was doing it secretly he couldnt involve any northmen to help him because as we saw with ramsay and arya the northern weddings dont take much i am worried about where they are going with robbs story line if only they had let robb and catelyn hear rickon and bran were dead before they both make those turning point decisions it would have been more understandable"

"Ghost Rider",2012-06-05,"its not as if they had to be married immediatelywhile i was quite surprised at the faith wedding ceremony i was more shocked at the fact of the marriage itself obviously being a book reader i knew it was bound to come up but i thought theyd give some reason for why robb would marry talisaso far the story goes he falls in love with a beautiful camp follower thats what battlefield nurses were right and of course they get into each others pants so where does the marriage come in talisa certainly didnt look like an innocent virgin to me and if that should be the reason for marriage they should have mentioned itelse if its just love even from a modern pov marriage doesnt follow straight from love necessarily love doesnt need marriage it can well exist without so if the modern pov doesnt work lets work from a kind of medieval view but theres the problem that love and marriage arent connected at all in robbs mind there shouldnt be a close association between romantic love and marriage thats a 19th century bourgeois thoughtif you want to cite the relationship between ned and cat as a point in favor for love in matrimony its actually a point against it because they learnt to love each other ie its a kind of family love that very often exists in happy longterm relationshipsso am i the only one puzzled as to why robb married talisaedited for wrong word usage edited by ghost rider 05 june 2012  0258 am"
"madman2711",2012-06-05,"i think that the could get married in front of the 7 but at least mention the old gods what really bothered me is the haste of the marriage and cat just sitting and getting bashed by her son and doing nothing in contrast the psycho bratt jeoff didnt break his vow about sansa untill the high septon and the kings council allowed him to marry margey tyrell i mean the public 1 hate character that beheads ned and does only what he wishes keeps his vows till the official annoulment and mr king in the north  mini ned stark all about honor and stuff doesn keep his vow not for a womans honor but for love this is the cheesiest cliche ever at least book robb was in his way a honorable men breaking a vow because he broke a maid but tv robb is about love as i said in another thred tulissa doesnt even look or act as a maid so she might be a wench after all so his attitude is f u all am getting married for love this is not a 21st century storry but a medieval fantasy marring for love is stupid and not acceptable by their stantards look what rl got for their love story or tyrion and tysha also on a more funny topic i just wanted to see the full nuptial party with the cape around the shoulders and the strip naked part done by greatjon along with rude sex jokes just like the book it was quite a fun part even on the rw chapter and i think umber would have hated robb for not doing that naked part that he loves to do on all weddings including nedd and cat"

"Morrigan",2012-06-05,"the rains of castamere is about lord tywin obliterating a house for opposing him the rains of castamere is still a perfect song for the red weddingmeh the songs were about vassal houses to lannister the reynes and the tarbeck not about equal great houses that eventually warred with lannister otherwise theyd have to crush the tyrells who sided with the targaryens etc when tyrion learns of robbs folly from his father hes baffled at the westerlings for going along with it have they forgotten what happened at castamere he wonders so i guess it still fits because of the whole lannister victory theme but not nearly as much the dialogue between tyrion and tywin was great foreshadowing"

"Lord Varys",2012-06-06,"the robb subplot brilliantly succeeds in showing why aging up robb stark and changing the westerling subplot to this travesty of a love story completely sucks how the thing works in the books 1 even a 15yearold robb stark only ended up marrying jeyne westerling because lady sybelle and rolph spicer played the honor card and even this young robb stark only ended up sleeping with jeyne because he was hurt physically arrow wound and emotionally news about the death of his two brothers 2 marrying jeyne has to have been a rather hasty and unreflected decision the freys were with robb at the crag after all if robb asked anyone for counsel about this matter say for instance his greatuncle the blackfish or the greatjon they would have talked him out of it and the freys would have heard about his plans in time it very much seems as if robb had presented his lords bannermen with his new queen after they had already been married remember black walder frey told robb that his sisterscousins would not mind marrying a widower  the freys only heard about after the thing was done this strongly indicates that robb was somewhat isolated from his men while being treated at the crag even he would have realized that marrying jeyne was a very bad idea had he properly thought the consequences through after all its evident later on that robb realizes that this was a very bad decision he loves jeyne but he is not stupid enough to deny that it would have been better for him his family and his cause if he had not married her why a robb love story could not possibly have worked in the tv show 1 richard maddens robb is not a 15yearold boy book robb may have kissed girls before he met jeyne but he most likely never was genuine in love with a noble girl before jeyne was his first love and this made him irrational richard maddens robb surely was in love before he met talisa so this could not possible be a first time romance 2 robb stark would never have fallen for an impoverished exotic nobleborn camp follower this is a fact his whole upbringing would not enable him to fall in love with a woman whose personality has virtually nothing to do with the way noble women behave and talk in the world of westeros they would never have met nor would they have talked to each other the way robb ended up talking to her robb stark would never have been aroused by a completely boring story about a boy nearly drowning in the rhoyne id go as far as saying that no sane man would be seduced by this kind of story  3 even if they had stuck to the whole westerling plot and the rash decision  it would have been difficult to sell to the audience with an elder robb the only way i can think it right would have been if they had made a strong point about robbs honor all the time and then made lady sybelle and ser rolph catch him while deflowering precious jeyne  a cut from that shot directly to the wedding would have worked in a funny way with robb complaining afterwards about what was i supposed to do but it completely sucks characterwise if they are actually discussing the whole topic and its consequences before the marriage happens alas this is a dangerous thing to do and it literally contradicts and distorts everything i should stand for as a king and it might very well cause severe political repercussions for me in the immediate future but i am in love and i dont care if i live or die the fact that there is no reason given why the wedding has to be right now and not say after the war is won and the allegiance of house frey truly nothing king robb has to care much about is but a minor annoying detail in this travesty of a story i guess they dont address this point in the series because they could not come up with a reason the only reason why they married in the book was the fact that not marrying jeyne would have dishonored her in front of her family"

"Lord Varys",2012-06-06,"1 we have to guess about the arrangement surrounding the actual marriage of course but its quite clear that a lot of stuff here is weird first there is robbs arrow wound and the immediate surrender of the crag afterwards that was the beginning of the setup confirmed only by the fact that lowborn rolph spicer sybelles brother and thencastellan of the crag was named lord of castamere by king tommen robb states to cat that he ended up being comforted by jeyne in the night he learned about bran and rickons deaths considering that the blackfish or the greatjon did not prevent robb from this foolish decision i guess sybelle and rolph surprised robb and jeyne while they were at it its quite clear that robb felt honorbound to marry jeyne afterwards but im not sure he would truly have stuck to that decision if he would have not been directly confronted by jeynes family after all telling a girl you love her and actually marrying her are two completely different things and robb would have had time to change his mind would he have had the opportunity to think or talk it through 2 well at least im not in sex mode 24 hours a day and talking about the siblings or the childhood of my girlfriend who actually looks better than oona chaplin  is not the best way to get me going but well perhaps im weird"

"birdsong66",2012-06-08,"cant wait to see him break the news to catabout what a pregnancy or the wedding i think the scene between robb and catelyn prior to the wedding was meant to convey that he was informing her of his future intentions she was explaining reasons why it was a bad idea to marry her very subtly suggesting that passionate love in the woods while quite exciting is really more about lust than love proper and not a reason to forgo the freys altogether as there is always the possibility that this burning flame will extinguish just as quickly or thats my take anyway i confess how she said it and what she said made feel so bad for this woman all over again fairley is just a gemas for how i thought the wedding would look props to the poster who suggested the similarity with braveheart it is the perfect illustration for why it seemed so off out of tune so to speak and i expected the bride to be presented with the stark family sigil cloak belonging to robb not a scrap of material weaving hands togetherof course he wants to marry her honor aside which is exactly the point i think catelyn is trying to make robb i understand that this new world your penis has found is very exciting and all you want to do is immerse yourself entirely by marrying talisa but you have discovered passion and lust not love and though she may be your first experience with all this and you want to marry her ido you clearly understand what will happen if you marry heri had roslyn frey been there and just as attractive couldnt robb have had every possibility of exciting passionate and lusty encounters with her as wellmy point is that the woman with whom robb becomes involved be it a frey jayne volantis medicine woman is irrelevant to the point that what robb is fixated on is the very superficial aspects of passion lust excitement sex making him quite opposite of ned and it is the actions based on this fixation that leads to his substantial consequences not the actual marriage itself but the inability to see the entire infatuation as transient in nature at best ill advised by all at worst the robbcatelyn was very short but it conveyed a substantial amount of information that i think is very easy to overlook upon first viewingoh and i hate the entire robbtalisa debacle so im just trying to interpret it in ways that are easier for me to accept dunnogif classbbcemoticon altdunno "

"Dio Forel",2012-06-08,"lol i like reading this post it feels like i am reading somebodys facebook page and theres a battle on it people talk like they live in westeros and know the characters personally one thing i do know for a fact however is that it is definitely implied that robb was basically a virgin with no actual experience with a woman thatd be why the second talisa got on top of him he was done lol the whole arc honestly didnt do much for me and i am just assuming the reasoning for the change will be seen in the future why dont we just wait to see how this all turns out i can appreciate criticism but some people are acting like somebody just shot somebody they love just breathe it will all be okay these things are all fixable next season"

"7V3N",2012-06-08,"this is almost the worst set of opinions ive read so far on this forum its a completely irrelevant issue both book robb  show robb broke their vow for the same reasoni dont want to marry the frey girlalthough you dont hear him say it in the books its clear that its what he thinks both versions of robb fall in love with jeynetulisa its clear it doesnt need to be spelt out nedcatelyn evidently had a fairly dour marriage complete with suspected bastard in tow once he clapped eyes on jeyne he just wanted to be with her call it selfish arrogant etc but its how it went down he thought he could get away with breaking his vow he was wrongbtw its almost ludicrous to suggest that after hearing that your two younger brothers have been brutally murdered by someone whom you thought was a childhood friend that youd be up for sex and then care enough to subsequently marry the girl unless you truly were in love with herstarting off with an insult to all of the people you want to persuade is being a pretty big dickbut if robb didnt take jeynes maidenhood you think he would have still married her i find that silly i do think he loved her but robbs sense of duty could overpower love imo it could not however overpower his sense of honor jeyne went from being a good match for a highborn husband to being a scrap for some bastard or minor lord except robb took action and went against the norm bigtimewe are most prone to mistakes when we are emotionally vulnerable edited by the shadow fox 08 june 2012  0852 pm"

"Burt Clegane",2012-06-08,"i apologise if people took offence by that remark in answer to that point about jeynes maidenhood and prospects for robb marrying her if he didnt deflower her then my answer is i dont know i dont think any of us can since we never got a robb pow i doubt well get a jeyne pov unlessshe is pregnant so it seems like the mystery of what truly happened died with robb one possibility i thought and subsequent reason for tulisa having this medical background could be that she might realise that she is being slipped the wrong potion and promptly ditches it a long shot yes but possible by fleshing out this character more and making her story with robb more of your standard boymeetsgirl setup it gives us the viewer more emotional stock in caring about this woman once her husband is brutally murdered especially if they give us little hints that she might be pregnant i have a feeling that this is one of the secrets that grrm told the producers it would explain to me at least why theyve made this minor change to robb  jeynes arc edited by burt clegane 08 june 2012  0906 pm"

"Castel",2012-06-08,"eh clearly you havent been following this series every single king has been selfish in this series every single one is stomping around trying to get their way to prove they are the true king hence the war your definition of evil is well kinda silly its called naivete he doesnt truly understand the drastic ramifications of his actions he was thrust into this position of power driven by vengeance he acts based on his instincts and based on the moment basically like a stubborn kid he isnt evil in the slightest the reason the red wedding was so shocking was because the ramifications in no way couldve been known to be so severe robb basically thought it was gonna be where he can smooth it over somehow or that theyd just be pissed off not that there would be some hidden plot that would lead to a mass execution during a wedding you cant be evil and be a minute man at the same time lol you saw that sex scene that is blatant ignorance and inexperience not evil and yes i know that he didnt hear about his brothers being missing but how does that mean he couldnt be grieving his father is dead his sisters held captive his brothers are stuck in winterfell the guy has a hell of a lot to be grieving about still and btw evil wouldve been raping talisa and laughing about it he has a heart but unfortunately he is just way too naive to be a king which is exactly why his reign was so shorti was with you for a moment then i wasnt i think that you show a bit of naivete yourself i think we have different definitions of evil evil to me is creating a situation where people who should not suffer do suffer on a large scale that serves no purpose and has no justification so jaime could be said to be evil for creating a situation where he would be forced to throw bran out a window yet i found that most people that find him evil do so not only because of the act but how his is unrepentant that plays no part as far as im concernedthe interesting thing though is that bookrobb is evil as well when i look at it he created a situation where thousands of people could potentially suffer to save the honor of one girl and protect her family even putting aside his griefbased fling he did marry her the next day and create a terrible situationnow tvrobb is much more selfish and childish despite his age and he creates the terrible circumstances while fully lucid and doesnt have the same pressure to marry that said his actions lead to the same conclusion as far as we can tellit hit me that im doing the exact same thing that others are doing excusing or at least downplaying one robb based on one set of expectations him being honorable while disparaging another set of expectations people in love should always follow their crotches regardless of common sense but at the end of the day they will probably have the same avoidable kill count and they both had the exact same information really and it occurs to me that im being a bit unfair here the palatability of either action will depend on the person the terrible consequences and the blame donttheyre both terrible and while tv robb doesnt fit the mold of tragic hero he really doesnt imo he and bookrobb are selfish in their own unique ways bookrobb refuses to put aside his honor and the honor of one particular person in the face of the honor of the freys and the greater crown and tvrobb refuses to put aside his penis while one may seem nobler in the end  theyre both arseholes one is slightly less of an arsehole maybe but hes still an evil arseholegod now im really torn and dizzy edited by castel 08 june 2012  1047 pm"

more or less the same happened between robb and jeynehis needs are severely hampered by his position a position ive explained various times over go back and read them if you wishi know youre right but the point is that only few people are able to always control their emotions people make mistakes people with judgment clouded by lovegriefwhatever make mistakes we have to take in consideration the whole situation why and when he did what he did and in that moment his needs werent something he could ignore easily the fact that he is young and hurt didnt helpit isnt a moment of vulnerability though he fucks talisa then dwells on the decision even consults with someone about it then decides to marry her anyway i cant remember if her honor was referred to at all but if not shows he didnt even give much of a toss about that because hes the king and he can do what he wants season 2 robb is a drastically different character than book robb and season 1 robbi think that the honor part is implied if you love someone i doubt youd want her treated as a whoreand no its not about im the king so i can do what i want its more why i have to sacrifice this too why when everybody  even my mother that i consider an example  do what they want is it stupid yes but looking at all they lost to behave honorably and trust people is understandablehe did it anyway because he loves her he respect her and want to protect her at any cost actually the fact that he cares about her regardless of her rank is something that weighs in his favor imohe slept withmarried her not because he suddenly needed a moment of relief and then thought ooops i was supposed to be a honorable man now i have to marry her there are real feelings behind his actionsfeelings that he shouldnt follow  yes and its here his tragedyid love to hear why this is so ridiculous the guy heard that his best friend had betrayed him and his brothers had been killed id love to know any one of us who hasnt done the odd rash andor stupid thing when upsettry to picture the scenariotwo virgins one is a shy sweet and innocent girl her virginity is the most important thing for her actually seeing her family conditions the only thing she had the other is a boy equally shy with girls imo  weakened physically by his woundsthe terrible news arrivesthe boy is devastated maybe he cried maybe he raged maybe he just sat silent in his bed for hoursthe girl was there she was sorry for him and didnt know what to do to ease his pain maybe she hugged him listened to his angry wordsthe last thing in their mind imo were their hormones or that rolling around in bed together could help things get betterbut apparently jeyne suddenly decided that her virginity wasnt so important if she could comfort a man she barely knew and that  unless robb told her after the night together it would be awful  was promised to another girl and robb was so weakened and sad that he suddenly found her so arousing he couldnt help himselfimo it is stupid and ridiculous unless they already liked each other and decided to ignore their feelings and then lost it when after the news everything else seemed so unimportantbut people say that he slept with her only because he was upset someone even said i dont remember where that he was drugged so he wasnt himself but this technically means that jeyne took advantage of him xd that robb married her only out of honor and not because he also liked her and didnt want to marry the frey girlso yep i find this interpretations stupidi dont want the impact of the red wedding to be taken up with the death of tru luv angle though it would be hilarious in a way if after having deprived us of any of the emotional impact of robb and catelyns reactions to the death of loved ones we get to see talisa hearing about the rw the seven shall weep because its a minimal aspect of it im afraid when the red wedding occurred only a very small amount of me went oh no jeyne will be devastated instead i was more like fuck there goes mormont and manderly and the smalljon fuck fuck fuck the north is disintegrating word by word grey winds howoh shit he knew walder frey is a vile expletive not worth repeating with all due respect to jeyne my heart does not bleed for her relationship with robb as much as the writers seem to want it toi dont know why they chose to not use the deaths of bran and rickon i dont like it either to be honest but their reasons to me are still valid enough a different kind of pain but still painthe rw will be the death of characters we love good people that are betrayed in the most horrible way i will be sorry to see robb die also because he wanted something for himself after everything he lost and was losing i will be sorry for every victim of the rw and there will be people who will be sorry also for talisa but where is the problem it doesnt change anything you didnt care about jeyne and will care less about talisa soanybody more invested or indeed invested at all in this show storyline is incapable of love i jest but not reallyim incapable of love then as you are incapable to accept other povs if you dont like something doesnt mean that other people cant and that you can judge them jeezyeah cos i tend to find asoiaf gots joys come in its simplicities multilayered character driven plots meh horny teenagers going at it for petty reasons sign me upa boy that in a moment of vulnerability decided to sleep with a girl he loves and then chose his heart and to protect her honor is less about hormones and more about feelings this made him more layered than a boy who couldnt control his hormones and used a girl because he was sad and then couldnt live with his guilt and decided that she was more important than his duty and his men

character who wasnt explored deeply jeyne westerling was even less important as a character in a story that already has lots of important characters its just not possible to allocate the same attention to every supporting part whats true in the book is even more true for the show the attention given to this budding romance took time away from main characters that would sorely have needed moremhmm i said that even if i didnt love everything about rt i enjoyed their story and that i never liked the deathnewssex thing between rj in the books so i was glad they didnt use it in the show i could definitely get behind that surely it was a moment of weakness for robb when he heard the tragical news and jeyne was probably egged on by her relatives but its not necessary for me because i just dont think its that importantrj is up to interpretation between rt i think we can say it is lovehmm i guess you could probably argue in both cases that it wasnt love but a crush at least if you have a similar understanding of love imho you can fall in love with someone at first sight have a crush on him and while we may feel its true love its really only hormones we are drugged so to speak in such situations real love doesnt develop until later when the crush is finally gone and you can see the person you love without rosetinted glasses so i would argue in neither cases is it loveanyway

you and none other thankfully we can be rational as well we mustnt be slaves to our feelings as such we are able to controll these feelings if we really want to knowing as we do that very likely they will pass we must decide in such situations whats more important your crush or your relationship or to apply this to robb your crush or your kingdomi could agree with you if he sought talisa with the intent to sleep with her and broke his vow but he didnt he was just intrigued by this different girl and when he had the chance he spent time with her talkingah yes the innocence he was intrigued because he had a crush on her no other reason and if you have a crush on someone you desire himher more then anything this person occupies your mind day and night you think him or her to be really special but if you know that such a relationship is not possible eg because you are already promised to someone else you know that you are playing with fire when you seek the company of that person because there is only one medicine against a crush keep away from that person until its gone unless you want to burn of course but then you have to live with the consequences and you are not blameless

the books the westerlings sent her to him same as alys karstark was sent to get to know robb or lady dustin to brandon stark it also shows regard for their guest that the noble daughter cares for him btw i dont think we should imagine jeyne westerling as the type of nurse talisa seems to be i guess nursing just means bringing him food and drink and such stuff maybe playing him a songyeah but the point is that he had to choose between making this highborn lady who is already considered dishonored  and maybe was still a virgin  officially the kings whore and what about their children or making her an honest womanwell if they wanted to argue that they should have made her a highborn lady talisa neither looks the highborn lady nor does she act like one roaming around in a military camp should that be the reasoning of the show please tell me so in the show we got nothing instead crush  sex  marriage without explanation even though in my eyes and even more so in the eyes of westerosi one doesnt necessarily follow from the otherthere is virtually no reason for marriage talisa comes from volantis a place westerosi care nothing about she has no known connections she could just as well be a whore claiming to be nobleborn by marrying a woman of such background he is sure to become the butt of jokes similar to tywin lannisters father he disgraces his family with such a connection on top of not keeping his word and dishonouring himself by that in the world of asoiaf talisa would never be recognized as the queen in the north even if robb married her because she doesnt bring anything to

time and work i agree but when you can start to call your feelings for someone love and believe in your relationship when the emotional connection between two people is enough to be something more than hormones is it something that can be already there waiting to evolve or that need necessarily time to existanyway we can say that in both cases it was just a crush but this doesnt change their perception that its love and the fact that their action reflect this and so we have to judge them for what they are two young people in a critical situation struggling with the crushing force of first

unfairyet being a king does decree upon the ruler a degree of responsibility book king robb takes this responsibility seriously hence why his reasons for breaking said responsibilities were so grave and why he was genuinely remorseful about his actions he felt guilty about betraying his responsibilitiesshow robb keeps on testing his limits when hes clearly aware that hes coming close to having them breached this is why the decision to take away the deaths of br and theons betrayal as motive was so stupid and then shows little or no remorse towards either his mother for treating her like a bitch or for shrugging his shoulders and saying fuck the freysrobb is not infallible or perfect i think the books portray this perfectly well however the show is making him much less infallible or distant from perfection than he should be or is show robbs limitations make him a far weaker man than book robbif you love someone you respect her you dont want her considered a whore dont you obviously love is the main reasonyes but love and honour are two seperate things especially within the feudal context talisas name and stature are never seen as being a factor in show robbs decisioni could agree with you if he sought talisa with the intent to sleep with her and broke his vow but he didnt he was just intrigued by this different girl and when he had the chance he spent time with her talkingi and i imagine many others have spent time talking to girls we were intrigued by sometimes wed probably seek them out with the intention of talking all through the night but as interesting as this person may be i imagine we all knew what the end game would most likely be if he knew that he was getting more and more attracted to talisa and was on the verge of breaking his vow then he should

"birdsong66",2012-07-14,"did the starks deserve the rw no however from a freybolton viewpoint the easy conclusion to draw is that having formed a secret alliance with tywin each felt that their actions would be without consequence as tywin is really running kl at that point in the story that they upped the ante and committed a full on massacre despite a clear breach of guest right and custom reflects exactly how secure both houses felt about their positions being under the canopy of lannister protection ultimately tywin came off better than the boltons and specifically the freys despite his involvement which iirc hasnt really been illuminated thus the trees are more frequently adorned with several freys some boltons and even fewer lannister loyalists because tywin was astute enough to arrange it as though his involvement was along the lines of capture enemy combatants for hostages and kill tkotn rather than kill every enemy attendee all of them to the last all of this is to point out the simple idea that if you believe you have the blessings of those in charge then every action taken subsequent is thought to have similar blessings or will be condoned in like manner in short it frees you up from custom enough to imagine develop and partake in an egregious breach similar to or exactly like the rw there was no fear forof lannister reprisals obviously they were wrong in this assumption but cie la vie in westeros"

"ExileOnDaytonStreet",2013-01-21,"honestly im amazed that this topic lasted 18 pages granted with a few twists and turns in there robbs wedding being in the faith of the seven either only makes sense in the context of them being in the westerlands at the time or it is a complete continuity oversight by the show runners given the nature of a few of the other similar continuity errors karstarks use of mother and father for instance its safe to guess the latter kind of hard to have more to say about it than that isnt it"
"StannisandDaeny",2013-03-29,"yeah it doesnt make much sense if you completely ignore the books though which they seem to have done it might i forgot who said it but the phrase by the old gods and the new does seem to appear a couple of times spoken by various speakers i dont think they ever established the two religions all that well save at the wall damn you people now ill have to rewatch season 1 and 2 entirely and just pay attention to this winkpng classbbcemoticon alt  edited by stannisanddaeny 29 march 2013  0247 pm"

"Gigei",2013-03-02,"that makes little sense he doesnt have to have a vault overflowing with rare and exotic treasures to be the richest man in qarth in a land with no credit cards i dont really see how he could have hustled a mansion filled with gold statues cups and decorations he was dressed like nobility lived in a mansion and had servants and money to host all of qarths nobility he made it into one of the 13 for him to have no magical all valuable treasure in his vault i can accept but just the cost of making the valarian stone vault would not be trivial to say his wealth was completely a fraud i consider that a poorly written story line the vault itself would have cost a tremendous amount of money the fact that it was empty means nothing i agree on that point most of his wealth would have been in ships and trade goods that are on the movei dont think anyone meant that it was literally all a lie just that he wasnt anywhere close to being the richest man in qarth he used the illusion of wealth to gain some actual wealth but probably used nearly all of that to better maintain the illusion its a pretty common storytelling trope actually and one with real world examples bernie maddof for instance apparently couldnt even pay his credit card bills the month before he was arrested but everyone thought he was worth billions huh that does make sense if you put it that way i dont get why both of the handmaidens died no more lesbian love scenesbtw i like the actor that played xaro smilepng classbbcemoticon alt "

"FierceElite",2012-06-04,"didnt care for tyrion waking up to be shit talked by pycelle that guy deserves no redemptioncourt scene was one of the pretty decent scenes of the episode my only issue is margaery being there already and loras not asking to serve on the kingsguard didnt care for littlefinger talking to sansa eitheroh goodreturn of the pointless ros scenes putting varys there didnt make it any betteri think the part where brienne sees the hanging people and wants to bury them is when the ship shows up to hunt them down if im remembering that correctly i can see how the budget wouldnt allow for that scene its whatever what bothers me is brienne randomly killing people all the time for all her skill i remember it being a big deal when she killed someone for the first timei actually approve of robb being more angry with catelyn for letting jaime go in the show than he was in the book him letting it go because he needed her approval for marrying jeyne was weak however i dont like how hes basically spitting in her face robb would never talk toabout his parents like thatstannis choking out melisandrenot even going to bother touching that oneive really grown to like theons actor i like that theyve expanded on his deeper emotions also lold  him raging over the horn i didnt even understand exactly what happened with the winterfell scene until i watched the recap at the beginning of this episode again so roose gave commands to ramsey to convince the ironborn to turn over theon in exchange for letting them go back home what a lame change after a pretty compelling speech too also i heard wex but didnt see himsevere lack of pod looking at his feet varys and tyrion was decent enough tyrion and shae was awful every time she speaks i want to mute the sound i dont particularly care but this pretty much confirms if it wasnt already that tyrion wont be losing his noserobb andalmost indisputably talisa theres no way they reveal her to be jeyne after this point being married was short so i guess i wont complain about the waste of time my one nitpick was sevencentered vows robb worships the old gods jaqenarya scene was okay i dont think he comes right out and tells her hes a faceless man though and he keeps talking about the red god if hes a fm shouldnt he be following the manyfaced god felt like the transformation was pretty cheaply donebran and gang coming out of the crypts scene was whatever would have meant so much more if they didnt completely give it away 3 episodes ago or whatever it was maester luwins death was sad i guess theyll stumble upon meera and jojen somehow next season then the group will split will probably end up being a forced one to up the drama rather than an amicable split i was probably the only one that did this but was anyone looking at the smoke over winterfell intently heh i figured there wouldnt be the faintest sign of anything especially given that it wasnt through the eyes of summer i was so focused on the smoke the first time i didnt even notice hodor pushing bran in a cart lol guess its too much for old man hodor to carry him the entire wayhouse of the undying was such an indescribable let down they didnt even try to make it like the book not a single damn vision they brought jason momoa back for fan service rather than including visions that have a ton of bearing on the past and future of the series wiki paraphrasing of hotu1 a beautiful naked woman being ravished by four of the dwarves who serve the house2 a feast of slaughtered corpses holding cups spoons and food with a dead man with a wolfs head sitting on a throne wearing an iron crown3 daenerys childhood home in braavos4 a throne room with dragon skulls on the walls where a king resembling aerys ii targaryen sits on a barbed throne5 a room where a silverhaired man presumably rhaegar targaryen names his son aegon says the child is the prince that was promised then plays a harp6 a splendor of wizards who falsely claim to be the undying of qarth and offer to teach daenerys the secret speech of dragonkindupon reaching the chamber of the undying daenerys is spoken to in a barely perceptible whisper the undying call her mother of dragons and child of three and tell her some prophesies saying three fires must you light one for life and one for death and one to love three mounts must you ride one to bed and one to dread and one to love three treasons will you know once for blood and once for gold and once for love the undying show daenerys many more visions before attacking her they are slain by drogonlike they didnt even try i assumed we wouldnt get a perfect hotu but the show basically didnt even need this version of it i actually liked the iron throne room vision because its pretty good foreshadowingassuming but drogo and rhaego so pointless pyat pree dany already using dracarys and xaro presumably dead two characters with parts to play in the future along with doreah who lived past when she was supposed to just to die in a different pointless way smh kind of curious where dany suddenly got all those followers toothey butchered qhorins character and his relationship with jon so atrociously it was bad enough that jons character in season 1 and 2 leading up to this has been awful hes extra emo and makes retarded decisions i dismissed it earlier because ghost going hunting is actually okaybut where the hell is he at this point hes been gone for half the season even with jon in danger and wasnt there to help take down qhorinsosam gets caught out in the middle of everything as the others and wights are about to storm the fist of the first men which i still cant get over being a field of snow with some rocks a white walker i believe this makes the 4th time weve seen one in 2 seasons of the show when 5 books into the series weve only seen them twice comes upon sam stares directly at him and ignores him just wow because that makes sense that other in the opening scene of season 1 let the dude go too pretty peaceable creatures apparently i thought they were going to move up sam the slayer scene which i guess would have been acceptablebut they didnt even do that i cant fathom what they were going for therethey had so much to work with to make the finale awesome and they bombed it completely"

"Tadco26",2012-06-04,"how did dany and her kalasar of  a dozen people take over the house of the king of qarth he has no guards sam is just overlooked by the white walkers and their army of zombies the wildlings let jon go because qhorin attacked him and rattleshirt was the one who gave the order with no prompting from anyone else why would he seemingly trust jon more now than the scenario in the book where jon asks to join them and rattleshirt tells him to kill qhorin to prove himself even after that he still doesnt trust jon the sad thing is they could have rearranged the order of events and followed the original story line very closely with the same amount of screen time and budget instead jon hasnt even said he wants to join them yet and now he is free at the lord of bones suggestion is pyat the only warlock in the order we have this long of a build up for the house of the undying that doesnt even have any undying in it and we get none of the original prophesies even the prophesy from season 1 was cut leaving out the part where she is told she will never bear another living child which argueably was the most important part im curious why they even bothered with ser dontas in episode one and havent had a scene with him since while littlefinger has already offered to take sansa home did varys recruiting ros really warrant that much screen time i dont think the scene was bad if you have unlimited screen time but i also dont see what it added considering how one of the main defenses of changes to the book is they dont have enough time to fit it all in how did ros get away from cersei anyway brieene is now a ruthless killer who seems to enjoy it robbs attitude and actions leading up to his wedding have made me a frey sympathizer he abandoned his people and his gods for a hot girl and all the other reasons were swept aside and they considered this an improvement better to just keep the romance off screen if that is the best they can come up with stannis almost chocking mel out and her god doesnt save her in any way the way it does with davos and cressen why not have the gem burn his hands or something he stops for no obvious reason and then she is all pressed up against him and affectionate again as if they just got out of bed together or something no mention of how they lost because stannis left her behind and that was one of the better scenes in the episode the faceless men now train people so they can get revenge on those who wronged them shae is a confusing mess of a character who makes it seem like she is insulted that he thinks maybe she only cares about him for his money and wants him to go over seas with her so why doesnt tyrion say that if she really loves him he will stop paying her in the context of the show what happened to winterfell and why doesnt luwin tell them why would luwin think they would get help at the wall anyway since the nights watch takes no part"

"Obsidiana",2012-06-04,"aside from all the changes to the story one visual complaint the hands of the wights looked perfectly normal instead of black with the wight girl in the first episode of season one i thought okay maybe not because she just recently died blood didnt have time to congeal othor wore gloves couldnt tell but this episode theres been a whole army of wights would if have been so hard to give them black hands i mean thats what stood out about coldhands too and would have been an important detail in showing theres more about him"

"Nahlim",2012-06-05,"alright so it is clear by now that the writers are not going to follow the books completely in fact i believe i have read that dd said that season 3 will start to get away from the books a lot more grrm said something about not watching then cause he is not sure he could stand it xd so i will offer the people here a kind advice  get used to it or stop watching now as of season 2 i stopped expecting the show to be like the book i am weirded out by some things too and i am not sure if i support the approaches dd are taking but i am still going to watch and pretty much love the show and before i start with the nitpicks i cant help but notice that some people dont see that in the show the characters have to take more extreme actions cause the writers are trying to emphasize some of their character features and they dont have thousands of pages to do this you cant compare character development in the book and in a tv show brienne is going to kill someone eventually and it is not important for the plot how much remorse she feels about it so character development in the show has to suffer a lot also shortcuts must be taken now the nitpick th hotu is the biggest really the prophecies haunt dany all the time especially the one about the betrayals she is supposed to question everybody because of it of course she will probably do so anyway because of dorea and xxd but its not as effective imo and i also have a feeling that quaithe may be the one to give her some of the prophecies in the show we will have to wait and see where it all goes also im puzzled with killing characters that appear later xxd in book 5 and using dracarys was book 3 danys awesome moment and they used it up here i didnt notice the septum at robbs wedding but i have to say that was a very inconsiderate plot hole and a mistake they shouldnt have made the other one is ros being free i have no issues with her character though she obviously has a role to play so its fine white walkers ignoring sam just doesnt work what was that and john killing qhorrin the way he did was badly executed and gods margaerys dress i was like okay you are very beautiful and have nice boobs but you want to be a queen woman not work in a brothel"
"protar",2012-06-05,"most of my nitpicks have already been said thankfully i read some of the threads here before seeing the show so i wasnt shocked by all the pointless changes and stuff and was able to enjoy the show on its own merits i wont deny that the hotu was still very atmospheric but one i wish they couldve had atleast some of the visions and two without the three fires prophecy its kind of pointless"
"Ser Zig-Zag",2012-06-05,"before the blackwater episode i was concerned about them having so many storylines to tie up in this final episode after the awesomeness that was blackwater i tricked myself into thinking they could pull it off man was i wrong theywritersproducers just seem to not understand the characters and their stories or they just dont carelazy writing"
"Tadco26",2012-06-05,"and before i start with the nitpicks i cant help but notice that some people dont see that in the show the characters have to take more extreme actions cause the writers are trying to emphasize some of their character features and they dont have thousands of pages to do this you cant compare character development in the book and in a tv show brienne is going to kill someone eventually and it is not important for the plot how much remorse she feels about itwe dont need to see pages worth of dialogue expressing her remorse that is true but we also dont need to see the exact opposite of remorse with her seemingly enjoying making the guys death as painful as she could to get him back for hanging the women she could have killed him quick and cleanly and responded differently than she did and still gotten that point across that she did it out of self defense andor justice rather than have dialogue that makes it seem like she has no pity or like taking peoples lives and enjoying it is normal to her"
"Sanette",2012-06-05,"i agree with everything thats been said in this thread these arent really nitpicks anymore but huge fuckups some of them are unfixable and im just so disappointed with this show i would really really like to know what grrm thinks about all this since everything has been discussed already ill keep it short 1 jon  they butchered his storyline and character this season ghost is mia even though hes jons best friend halfhand isnt this big father figure or a legend hes just a bitter old man i didnt expect some great emotional scene in the finale since there is no real relationship between qhorin and jon in the show but i sure didnt expect that jon would end up looking like a killer why the hell would the wildlings trust him now is beyond me besides that whole scene was so generic and underwhelming slowmotion or a muted sound would do wonders here thank god taylor wont be directing any more episodes in season 3 2 littlefinger giving out his plan to sansa i couldnt believe my eyes when i saw that scene did they really ruin one of the biggest twists in the third book just wow im sure dontos will play a part but littlefingers involvement wont be a shock anymore 3 hotu was just bad no visions no prophecies nothing memorable or weird or exciting i thought theyd pull a lynch with this scene but that would be asking too much drogo was totally redundant momoas whole salary for that cameo would pay for the visions and if they just showed me a major spoiler from the 6th or 7th book then ill be really pissed 4 i hate showrobb at this point he deserves all that is coming to him seriously hes acting like a little shit and hes supposed to be a king he basically said fuck you to his kingdom army and his mother by marrying talisa bookrobb at least had some good reasons for it 5 zombie apocalypse just wtf that scene was so cheesy and i almost burst into laughter when i saw that other why couldnt they just keep them as they were in the first season and why didnt he kill sam oh i forgot logic just isnt popular this season"

"Ser Elfor the Landstander",2012-06-04,"yeah they really destroyed qhorins character in the show jons path is more or less the same there are some deviations but qhorin was a much cooler character in acok he only lost that fight with jon because of ghost where is that direwolf anyways and jon learned a lot from their intense conversations before the fight its a waste but hes gone now"
"Howdyphillip",2012-06-04,"i agree qhorin did those things and because you and i know what qhorin is doing we know what he wants but im pretty sure jon snow has not read the song of ice and fire novels so he has to put what qhorin says together in his head by himself and the earliest that appears to happen is when long claw is siting inside qhorins belly jon seems legitimately angry when he is insulted and it his rage seems to be the legitimate cause for him killing qhorin all it would have taken was one shot of jon seeming to recognize the weight of what qhorin was doing before he killed him for me to be on the same page but it never happensall of these things are very good points i believed almost exactly the same way upon viewing the episode i truly thought that the character of jon snow had been ruined and that he had just murdered the halfhand it seems that this is an interpretation that i had because i was a book reader and it was spelled out to us in a completely different mannerthe fact of the matter is that every single tv viewer that i have spoken to knows that jon and qhorin had a plan to do this there is not one person that i have talked to that thinks the way that you or i were afraid of so the show has not changed jons character in this regard"

"The Smiling Eye",2012-06-04,"obvious please ive watched it twice and at no point is it obvious that jon is on the same page im giving the show the benefit of the doubt by saying that jon understood once he had already killed qhorin but that look on his face could just as easily be the shock of knowing he had just murdered his fellow crowi agree qhorin did those things and because you and i know what qhorin is doing we know what he wants but im pretty sure jon snow has not read the song of ice and fire novels so he has to put what qhorin says together in his head by himself and the earliest that appears to happen is when long claw is siting inside qhorins belly jon seems legitimately angry when he is insulted and it his rage seems to be the legitimate cause for him killing qhorin all it would have taken was one shot of jon seeming to recognize the weight of what qhorin was doing before he killed him for me to be on the same page but it never happensyoure making something out of nothing your argument holds no water jon understood perfectly well what qhorin conveyed to him and it showed after he disarmed qhorin he took a second to gaze at him as a farewell before running him through had he really been angry there would have been no hesitation and it might have even been a gruesomer deathqhorin conveyed to jon that he needed to kill him and jon did so this part of the story can not be argued the part that can is the believability of him actually defeating the halfhand in combat without ghost"
"Former Lord of Winterfell",2012-06-04,"they should know better than to expect viewers to remember what amounted to a throwaway scene from a couple weeks ago where qhorin gives jon the instructions on how to carry on forward with the wildlings they needed to have a final order from qhorin to help make sense of their little battlebut viewers did remember it it seems odd for people to criticise a scene for creating confusion among viewers when it seems that the viewers themselves understand exactly what happened the real complaint here isnt that the scene was confusing because both readers and viewers understand why jon did what he did the real complaint is by readers who wanted it to play out exactly as it did in the books and are using a bogus it was confusing to viewers argument to justify that if you are mad that it didnt play out exactly as it did in the books fine but to raising the false argument that people were confused when they really werent is wrong"
"Cheese Pudding",2012-06-04,"the problem wasnt the fight qhorin needed to make it real enough so that the wildlings could believe in it the problem was the lack of communication between him and jon he said what he needed to do but much of the nonreaders were like wtf"

"Arrogant Bastard",2012-06-04,"there are very few chapters with john snow in them in acok in none of these chapters would i equate him to sherlock holmes as a matter of fact the more chapters that are dedicated to him the dumber he looks in general it is kind of like more time spent with him on the tv show this year made him look dumber than the bookshe has a decent amount of chapters probably around seven or eight no hes not the sharpest guy but i felt like the tv show was going out of its way to portray him as a total nincompoop getting knocked out by craster which i felt was a cheap cliffhanger more suited to true blood seemingly letting ygritte go by missing the swing but then deciding to chase after her and then getting caught by wildings truthfully jon snows arc in acok was one of my least favorite in that book but it didnt annoy me nearly as much as the tv version and it did have a strong ending which jons storyline in season 2 did not frankly i think part of the problem is kit harrington hes just not very good and can really only do morose expressions"

"Mulled Wino",2012-06-11,"i know we did but im starting to understand his point of viewbecause if hes talking about jon show then hes right isnt he jon show is dumb and impulsive and less noble than bookjon now i would like to know if he knows that hes playing a different character and if he agrees with how the writers adapt his storyline and character i just hope theyll stay closer to the book next seasonthis is absolutely correct im just interested which came first was this how dd wanted his to portray jon show or is this kits interpretation edited by mulled wino 11 june 2012  0537 pm"

"SerMixalot",2012-06-11,"for me the whole jon arc in season 2 let alone the qh part was just plain wrong from beginning to end i actually get that qh ordered jon to do something but what that something is is open to debate creating problems for jon in the future even from a self justification standpoint will he truly believe qh was ordering him to kill him and join the wildings turn his cloak all without an explicit order i can see that dd attempted to put those orders in the series but the fact that they are open to question creates a huge problem for jon coming up given the extremity of the nw oath for example try not turning your cloak stay as a prisoner get intel and escape could fall under the same communication presented in the tv series ive said it before and i will say it again dd have communicated a motivation for jon that simply is 180 degrees from book jon they believe jon is seeking a father figure and clearly that characterization has transcended season 2 and i believe that it is a completely wrong interpretation and the basis for all the problems jons arc has that father figure seeking impacted his interactions with caster mormont and qh throughout the series are we believe that these travails have trained have matured have taught jon how to be a leader can show jon justify his actions over the next two seasons ie will he be man enough to spar mentally with mance escape the raiders defend against the thenns defend the wall against the wildings stand up to slynt stand up to stannis and melisandre no way and how stupid are the wildings jon hasnt even indicated a desire to turn his cloak why should rattleshirt be handing him a sword"

"VivaElRayoSenor",2012-07-29,"i realize im late in joining the discussion but i just finished season 2 yesterday for what its worth i thought the episode made jon look like a complete deserteroathbreaker what makes me furious is how out of character this is for a boy who was raised by ned stark and following in the footsteps of uncle ben jen its just not the stark way i wish there had been some dialogue between jon and the halfhand in fact i was waiting for it right up until the part where their faces came close together while they were fighting i thought this has to be it but nothing the scene could have been so much more dramatic and emotional if the writers had been slightly more demonstrative if the viewers had felt that jon had his back to the wall and would only kill the halfhand because it was critical to their mutual cause instead it appeared to viewers that they were fighting as enemies as for jons motivation for joining the wildingssome might conclude that he sadly deserted the nights watch because he liked a girlbros before hos jon aaahh so frustrating"

"Aemrys",2012-07-31,"the main problem with the whole qhorin  jon arc was that they had so little time together although brief qhorin did say that jon needed to infiltrate the wildlings and would succeed in it if he did what needed to be done however they ruined the fight and thus hurt qhorins reputation as an incredible fighter when they made jon win without ghosts help but this is all about budget so we just have to accept it although it sucks for qhorin it will really look weird if mance questions how jon could have possibly beat qhorin like he did in the books i guess they will just remove that question a complication with jons storyline much as sansas is that jons whole infiltration arc both pre during and post is heavily dependent on inner dialogue his has inner conflicts all the time and it really hurt his arc in the show"

"turdle",2012-06-04,"c now for reference i give season 1 a b i dont need the show to be a carbon copy of the books but i cant help get frustrated when the changes they make hurt the greater story and by far that is what most of the changes did even the one change that i really did like theon beheading ser rodrik doesnt quite add up in that how did they capture rodrik where are the men that were with ser rodrik but a couple of examples of changes that hurt the story 1 the shadow i knew they were going to do this and at the time it seemed like an ok thing to do but combining the two shadows into one was a mistake ive mentioned this in other threads but the order the audience sees a shadow in action and sees a birth are important because they indicate 2 different things in the book the shadow killing renly is our initiation into the shadow assassins and the important question the audience has is where the hell did that thing come from which is answered later when melisandre gives birth to a second shadow on the tv show seeing the birth first the question the audience has is what the hell is that thing going to do the answer is kill renly the implication in the book is that melisandre is for real and that you need to take her seriously the tv show doesnt have a clear implication is the shadow still out there was it only supposed to kill renly moreover the shadows scenes were consecutive so the setup had an immediate pay off as the start of the very next episode with no further ramifications its a total deus ex machina to get renly out of the way and nothing more and then were left for like 3 episodes around midseason with no davos stannis or melisandre why not pace yourself and have the shadow birth in there instead of shooting your wad at the beginning of the season 2 jon snowygritte i get it they want to set up their relationship early so it has more impact later on ok but they did it at the expense of jon and qhorin half hand not only that but while the jon and ygritte scenes were somewhat amusing they ultimately didnt go anywhere its just them wandering around talking for two episodes sucking up screen time that could have been better used making qhorin a better more interesting character than he ended up being 3 aryas story is a mess boy what hell arya went through this season right well not exactly it looked pretty bad at first but after about episode 4 she had it pretty sweet again i dont need arya to go through exactly what she went through in the book but hanging out with tywin lanister exchanging clever banter is no where near the hell she went through in the book do you know who i felt the worst for at the red wedding arya after all she had been through to get so close to her mother and brother and then to have them taken away from her how terrible but they cut out so much this season which really imo undermines her character combining her scenes and smashing bits of her story together might seem like a great idea in the writers room but thats the point of her story that she goes through so much cutting away what she goes through hurts her story and hurts her character 4 complete lack of build up i acknowledge that acok is a harder book to adapt than agot is but why on earth would you take acok which is longer than agot and try to fit it into a smaller hole acok in less than a full season they should have given acok more love this season was the season of acok bullet points no build up no set up just get from bullet point to bullet point why did the citizens of kings landing riot who knows i heard nonreaders after that episode talking about it like it was a planned attack and not a riot there was virtually no sense of dread or foreboding north of the wall i mean they were already at crasters keep in the first episode and rather than actually having the nw come across an empty wildlings village mormont just kind of says it and its no big deal just a bit of a curiosity and as great of an episode as blackwater was the build up to that episode was basically reduced to two scenes in the prior episode where a tyrion and bron joke about a maesters name and b tyrion joffrey and varys start out talking about the coming attack but end up just talking about how tyrion likes to play the game i get that some changes need to be made for budget purposes and thats totally understandable but the vast majority of the changes that i and others are bothered by are not a matter of budget theyre a matter of story telling having said all that i do think that visually they have done a very good job with all of the fantasy elements i think the dire wolves look great i think the dragons wights and white walkers all look cool even the things that look different than the way theyre depicted in the book like the shadow are well done and the strength of the underlying story is strong enough to carry this tv show imo despite the writing"

"Man in the Black",2012-06-04,"i would rate season 1 as a a great overall but it was a little too obvious in certain parts i still remember my friend who had never read the books calling that petyr would betray ned within about 45 seconds of him being onscreen this season i would rate as a c it was not bad and overall entertaining and only two of the episodes left me annoyed at the end the main issue was the unnecessaryboring scenes in season 1 there was only 1 scene that i wished would end as i was watching it the littlefinger likes to fuck people scene well and any scene that had theon having sex with anything now that i think about it there was a lot of that this season as well the robb scenes with not jeyne were just this weight around the neck of a lot of episodes i found dannys roll this season to be pretty meh though i think i disliked them while reading clash exception being the house of the undying which was pretty lame in the show was really disappointed we did not get to see rhaeger unless they start doing flash backs i do not think we will ever get to see him now hopefully next season will be much better storm of swords remains my favorite book in the series"
"Hedge Lawyer",2012-06-04,"ive said it before season 2 suffered from having to cram far too much in far too little time simply put far more happens than in game of thrones the list of new characters introduced was staggering brienne pyatt pree xaro the spice king stannis melisandre roose bolton davos craster gilly talisa podrick payne salladhor saan quorin halfhand dolorous ed ygritte yaraasha balon margeary tyrell lord of bones jaqen hgar just to name some season one basically took place in five locations the wall winterfell dothraki sea the vale of arynn and kings landing season two added harrenhal pyke qarth crasters keep dragonstone plus skipped around to renlys camp and beyond the wall the writers were forced to rush a lot of the story line along to fit everything in the alloted time i think even an extra five episodes could have made a difference although i would argue that clash of kings has two seasons worth of material buried in its pagesthe changes have been controversial to say the least personally i thought danys story arc was far better in the show i liked how pyat pree and xaro used dany as a pawn in their scheme to seize power in qarth pyat pree in particular was a much stronger nemesis than in the story and i found it far more plausible that somebody actually plotted to steal her dragons come on youre telling me that a halfstarved teenage girl wanders in to qarth from the desert with three of the most valuable creatures in the world that were previously thought to be extinct and nobody in that shady city thought of just snatching them from her far more interesting and i thought the house of the undying was a good payoffi wasnt crazy to the changes made to jon snows story however crasters keep was a disappointment and i thought the show exaggerated jons brooding side he just comes off as onedimensional and kind of dumb here liked the chemistry with ygritte but they needed to explain the killing of the halfhand better for those not familiar with the novels how quorin basically threw the fight with jon to sacrifice himself for the greater goodblackwater was fantastic gregor and company were a let down the tickler was far less terrifying than he should have been the closing scene with sam and the army of wightsothers was every bit as creepy as it needed to be all in all i give season one an a and season two a b enjoyed both tremendouslyi agree with virtually everything youve writtenid give season 2 a b  b season 1 was an a for me most of season 2s problems stem from trying to cram 15 episodes worth of material into a 10 episode season however splitting asos into two seasons will do wonders to address that problem"
"NedFlanderStark",2012-06-04,"honestly im just still so happy theyre making the books into a television show and that im able to watch jon snow fight qhorin halfhand im able to watch the blackwater set on fire green fire im able to watch arya  jaqen hghar terrorize harrenhal etc was it perfect of course not did it convey the general elements of asoiaf to nonreaders yeah i still think they nailed it even if dany didnt get 20 confusing visions in the hotu or qhorin halfhand didnt spell out his plan to the viewersjon snow i think anybody that actually pays attention can pick up on the themes and what was happening this season well acted mostly great visual effects and some awesome linesnuggets pulled directly from the books i cant help but give this season an a"
"boojam",2012-06-04,"id argue that this season was a collection of great scenes that together did not make a coherent and structured narrative each episode felt like it stood on its own with a cliffhanger somewhere in there to foreshadow what will arrive in a next seasonto me i cant fault a single scene in an episode seen stand alone  the cast the production design the cinematography  a almost always goodits kind the view master problem the next scene might be segued into very well but then it looks like a jump cut when you add up the narrative of the episodeproducers david benioff and dan weiss seemed to be the origin of the rush as if they had not spent enough time planning this season no quite fair to them first season seemed to flow so flawlesslysince the model  for this show at least is hbo model is 10 episodes they were stuck with too much source material and not enough time still  could there have been a better crew of story editorseven if the books did not exist the sum of each scene for each episode with the exception of 9 just seemed a narrative jumble i dont know  if there is are interviews with them post season i would like to hear lessons learned  because even with two seasons to sos can have the same structural problemsbecause of the cast and production values i was very entertained and i am a reader of the booksi give it an a just for those two things"
"LuisDantas",2012-06-04,"hmm i guess i give it a b i have come to realize that given the limitations and strengths of the chance of medium from the books to the tv and the need to have the story fit into ten segments of one hour each and making them worth watching on their own merits as well as fitting the budget and avoiding too much use of horses and secondary characters excessive faithfulness to the source material is more of a hindrance than an asset it would probably be better if we had half a book per season giving more time for the characters to develop or even to simply have lines but that might well be impracticable for it would mean keeping many actors and i do mean many actors for at least six years which is not exactly easy or affordable so realistically the adaptation had to make a lot of hard decisions and streamline and soapoperize the plot a lot which it did in mostly creative and succesfull ways i disagree with a lot of the choices but that only goes to show how darned many decisions the series had to make a few were definite improvements if not allout necessities making the roles of several characters that much clearer andor more interesting but even so the plot often enough seemed to magically jump ahead with no clear reason the best example is the moment when theon and dagmer decide to kill the children their reasons seemed to come out of nowhere others were far more succesfull  daenerys and xaro xoan bronn and tyrion arguably cersei definitely shae and melisandre stannis is a mixed blessing his motivation is both clearer and somewhat less convincing yet maybe that is for the best jons arc really could afford to be made clearer and had no good reason to be mangled to the extent it was a few minutes of setup with a conversation with qhorin would have helped a lot indeed maybe hbo went a bit too far into the territory of soap opera format with too much being set up and resolved inside the hour and boy did i miss the chain it was such a powerful testimonial of tyrions genius and made for such engaging scenes of naval battle good as episode 9 was it still fell short of the book"

"Gaius Martell",2012-06-04,"i think the major problem that this season faced was the sheer number of characters and different storylines going on just think of how many povs we have in a clash of kings jon catelyn sansa arya bran tyrion daenerys theon davos when we consider that robb is getting more screen time than he had in the books the kings landing players get their own scenes and jaimes early storm of swords story is moved into the end of this season were getting on average 5 minutes of each pov per episode its simply not enough time to do the stories as much justice as the books do them this is only going to get worse i fear as more characters become more important and the story continues to branch out that this cluttered bullet point style story might get even worse hell george himself saw that when writing affc and adwd splitting a storm of swords into two seasons as intended may be the best decision the writers of got have made there just might be enough time to spend on the plot that it can move forward and still be compelling"

"Leuf",2012-06-04,"oh i dont know exactly where i would put it as a grade b i suppose as someone else said the acting gets an a and the story get a d the first 8 episodes are a disjointed mess of great individual scenes i think much of the problems with this season can be traced back to the removal of riverrun and storms end i dont object to these things being changed just because they are changed but look at the ripple effect caused by it storms end renly gets his entire force moved from bitterbridge to an ambiguous location in the stormlands renly doesnt cut off the food supply coming from the reach to kl until magically in the riot episode the people are starving even though they werent this also causes renly to never divide his forces which then makes it really confusing just how the tyrells ended up with an army to help the lannisters the scenes involving the shadow baby get juggled out of order which ruins renlys death scene after renly dies stannis has nothing to do without storms end to take and thus drops off the screen for a couple of episodes one side of your epic battle shouldnt be off screen for multiple episodes riverrun the show has to be incredibly vague about what robb is doing in the early part of the season cat has to be able to get back to robb since she has no where else to go consequently we get no sense of wtf robb is actually doing hes just off somewhere fighting random lannisters that have no bearing on the story so he just becomes irrelevant robb has to cart jaime around with him and without cats home castle to escape from his escape becomes somewhat of a mess without riverrun to stop him tywin just has to sit at harrenhal the whole time this causes all kinds of problems tywinarya which was one of the strong points of the season has to drag on for too long and then end without any satisfaction tywin has to leave for kl at the last minute for no other reason than to fake out the audience i can understand why they had to cut riverrun from this season if you have riverrun you have to cast the tullys and theres already too many new characters this season i get why they had to do it and i think they compensated for it as best they could storms end on the other hand the story never goes inside the castle its just a damn matte painting its one of those things that superficially sounds smart to cut if we get rid of it then we only have one shadow baby itll save us lots of time and exposition but it didnt save any time it just caused scenes to be shuffled around for less effect and then stannis to have nothing to do then we have the lack of build up to the kl riot and blackwater i think often in adaptations tptb identify the most difficult parts of the story and put a huge amount of energy into making those things work in this case danys arc and then they somewhat take for granted the best parts of the story i think these guys were so amped up for blackwater that they forgot to amp the audience up for it they just took for granted that the audience would be amped up too and totally dropped the ball working towards it in the early part of the season a lot of this again has to do with both robb and renly just fucking around in tents all season without acting like any threat to kl but they never have the lannisters in kl actually worried about being attacked in the first half of the season i am totally okay with the chain not being in the battle but if you take the preparations of the chain out then you have to replace that with something that shows tyrion getting the city ready over the course of the season you cant have him suddenly realize the city might be attacked halfway through if the characters arent worried about an attack then the audience wont be either the choice of having joffrey threatening the whores in private with the crossbow rather than showing him actually shooting peasants who are at his gates demanding food just highlights the messed up priorities of tptb this season with all of that said i think the show juggled dany and jons story arcs pretty well i know that not everyone is happy with them but consider danys story in the book which goes something like this sit on ass in red waste sit on ass in vaes tolorro sit on ass in qarth being a tourist attraction omg hotu holy shit selmy i was pleasantly surprised they made it work as well as they did after stumbling at the gates of qarth pretty badly it gives me hope they can make her story work going forward i was upset they killed irri but if you can surprise and upset a bookreader with a death i call that a win the ending well in a perfect world i would have preferred to see it just end with the 3 horn blasts however i dont think were going to actually see the battle in s3 ep1 i think sam will probably just come in after it is over they arent going to blow the budget in the first episode so doing it this way gives us some real picture of the scope of what happens since its a lot cheaper to have a couple wws just basically sitting on a horse and some extras walking than a big fight sequence also its kind of a nice parallel to the end of last season which ended with the nw riding out in force beyond the wall this season ends with the wws riding out in force to meet them"
"The  Halfhand",2012-06-04,"in my opinion there were 2 things the writers of the show did wrong this season i dont want to go in depth though 1 house of the undying it seems obvious that the prophecies in the books are crucial to the plot of the storywhy would dd scrap these and is it just me or did the dracarys part seem kind of cheesy in the books it seemed way more badass and incinerating 2 aryas storyline the tywinarya dynamic was really good but when i realized they werent going to show her loss of innocence i kind of got really upset aryas third name trick and her kills while escaping were huge to her story in the arc againwhy would dd just gut this out edit forgot to grade it id give it a solid b edited by the halfhand 04 june 2012  1159 pm"
"House Balstroko",2012-06-04,"id give it a b with the first season being an a my biggest complaint was with the whole daenerys story line her arc was an utter mess aryas scenes were well acted and enjoyable but her character didnt undergo any kind of evolution like in the book i wanted to see arya at least kill the guard at the end so as to setup her path for the future jon snows change is strange but it works in the end"
"AeonFrog",2012-06-05,"c way too many unnecessary deviations from the source material everything about this season seemed thrown together at the last minute"
"Papa Manderly's Meat Pie",2012-06-05,"i would give this season a solid b i would give season 1 an a and that is not revisionist history for me i always thought season 1 was awesome but i do agree the tone for season 1 on these forums would not lead you to believe that so many would grade it an awhy a b because it was above average but not great here is what led me to that conclusiongreat and i do mean great storytelling at times great acting at all timeshowever that was undercut significantly by some bad storytellingjons story was significantly mishandled i dont have a problem with giving jon more time with ygritte i actually liked those scenes and was fine with them however i feel like jons fight with qhorin came out of the blue and it seems less believable that the wildlings would accept jon snow as a turncloak im not saying it has to be just like the books but i do think they needed to give him some more cover and they needed to establish the fight with the halfhand a tad more furthermore i found jon to be significantly stunted in his character growth compared to season 1 and to the books he seemed to regress back into emojon which i thought had been pretty much slain at the end of season 1 character regression is a negative in my eyes if it has no cause to happen within the story also the stay at crasters keep took way to0 much time the story stalled at that point overall i give this story arc a c the plus is because ygritte is awesome even if she is too pretty by book standards i would definitely not want to change the actress for the worlddanys story was fumbled at points but overall i felt it was actually an improvement over the books actually i should say that i feel like there is not enough of her in clash to warrant her own storyline on a tv show so all the machinations in qarth were interesting and ultimately necessary however there were some plotholes when she arrives outside qarth she has maybe 20 dothraki left in her horde after xaxospyatdorreah steal the dragons she appears to be left with only 1 dothraki and im not even sure who it is then after freeing her dragons and locking xaxos in the vault she suddenly has at least 15 dothraki again running around stealing things i know that is minor but that is a plothole that detracts from the willing suspension of disbelief that could easily been avoided i also feel like dorreahxaxos came out of left field and was not organic from the story as told to that point it made no sense i dont have a problem with the hotu at all though those scenes were beautiful and if they didnt think they could show those prophecies without giving too much away then i will have to defer to them on that however you still needed the house of the undying because you still needed something interesting for dany to do also i like how dany is presented with a temptation drogo to just stay at the hotu and let them use her as pyat wanted to in the end her storyline showed substantial and organic character growth with very minor plotholes so i would give it an ab gradewinterfell was a perfect adaptation it managed to help the tv show by cutting characters that in retrospect did not need to be in this season while maintaining integrity with the original story luwins advice to theon and theons speech to luwin and then speech to his men were brilliant theon and yara the name change from asha was unnecesssary and i am using that to downgrade it a bit had a great dynamic all in all this is what you want from an adaptation arobbcattalisa mixed feelings i do not feel that it is somehow vital to robbs character that he only sleeps with jeynetalisa after hearing about bran and rickons death that makes little to no sense to me especially since we really have no idea what motivated robb because the entire relationship occurred offpage however this could have long term implications if jeynes mom really was betraying robb by forcing jeyne to consume antifertility drugs whatever it was however this could be a tacit admission that the jeyne westerling that jaimie meets is a plant as some have theorized i thought the lovestory worked at times but at other times it was very cliche thats probably because they were making it up insted of adapting and it shows the exclusion of riverun while apparantly a necessity for budget reasons really screwed up this arc and while it wasnt a trainwreck it was far from perfect ill give it a cbriennsjaimie this was handled well and was a good decision to add in some of their journey to keep jaimie relevant to the viewers jaimie killing his cousin was a bit much but i dont think it was some basic betrayal of his character from the books however it really would have made more sense for him to have alton fake it so they could escape together otherwise both brienne and jaimie were developed perfectly solid arenly i think in retrospect it was a mistake to merge the shadowbabies but i cant fault them for making that decision to begin with they tried it one way and whether it worked or not is a matter of opinion but i dont think it means they made an obviously wrong decision furthermore they played up the love between renly and loras so that any fears that loras would just be seen as manipulative like he was in season 1 were laid to rest would have been nice to see him in his armor at one point though to make renlys ghost more poignant bstannisdavosmalisandre this storyline wobbled quite a bit early on and the shadowbaby scene just felt ridiculous however it built on itself all season long and by the end of the season it was very compelling although i still dont like the meilisadre actress if not for the early stumbles and th silly birthing scene this would be an a but im giving it an akings landing a lot to digest here so i will skim over it quite a bit most everything was handled excellently i dont think the riot was that confusing as everyone i talked to said they had been wondering how long the people would stand for joffrey as king plus they set up the popular discontent with the preacher who called tyrion a demon monkey and all the talk amongst the small council about how they didnt have enough food and they were having trouble keeping order with the influx of refuges i have always thought that cersei is a much more multidimensional character in the show than in the books and therefore i dont have any problem with her changes i thought joffreys whore abusing scene was important in his character development because it establsihed that joffrey was not just mindlessly cruel but he is actually maliciously and calculatingly cruel the only glimpse of this we get in the books is when we find out it was him that ordered the assassination on bran so i like it because it clarifies his character the tyrionshae dynamic for me was pretty much nonexistent through the first half of the season so i was glad they laid the emotion on thick at the end there that needs to be emphasized for the end of storm to have the impact that it does in the books the only thing i would have added to this more cersei complaing that tywin is marching back at her request to defend the city overall an alittlefinger almost nonexistent this season and when around he was a whirlwind of plotholes so he brought cat neds bones and she just left them there when they fled renlys camp it was a poignant scene but ultimately didnt make any sense and then he somehow manages to teleport to harranhal from one episode to the next and then it takes him the rest of the season to show up again and arrive at kings landing and did he notice arya or not however his interaction with sansas was a saving grace and his scene with arya was also great if nonsensical so it only gets a c its hard to grade something when there isnt a lot there to gradearyaharrenhaljaqen i feel this suffered from too much of a good thing arya and tywin are so awesome together that it feels like they changed a lot just to get more of these scenes all of these scenes were fantastic by the way dance is tywin lannister and maise is arya however aryas character arc has been completely altered or if it isnt then her character will just suddenly change for no reason so i give it an a for the actual scenes in this arc but an f for the impact on the storyline i guess if i had to merge them i would give it an overall d gradethe white walkers i loved the white walkers very realistic looking and they had an ephemeral otherworld look to them those blue eyes were haunting however i really hate sam just sitting there as a zombie army amasses around him and the white walkers just not caring about him doesnt make any sense also although realistic i didnt like how the three horn blasts were so close together i imagined them being deeper and mor edrawn out that isnt really important though also the attack should ahve been at night that is kind of important for white walkers great looks with fundamental flaws gets you a cin the end i agree with the posters that are saying this season suffers from compression problems they really did need to stretch many of these chapters into next season however despite the handicaps they were facing trying to fit clash into 10 episodes they did a solid job and deserve the solid b grade i handed out at the beginning of this magnum opus of mine edited by papa

"Caligula_K2",2012-06-05,"b id say first season was a high blow a my biggest criticism is that there are too many characters per episode making many episodesplotlines feel disjointed the best episodes of the season besides the finale which i thought did a pretty good job wrapping everything up were 3 6 and 9 3 focused on tyrion in kings landing 6 on theons capture of winterfell and 9 on the blackwater if youre going to show a character make sure you show him or her for more than two minutes make sure each episode advances a characters plot or character development dont show me dany if shes just going to have a one minute scene in which she claims shes the mother of dragons for the seventeenth time episode 8 i remember was the worst for this other criticisms stannis could have been developed better though i thought the actor did a fantastic job with the role i really liked that they made more happen in danys storyline and added some tension but there really were too many i am the mother of dragons scenes often turning dany into a one note character i also like that they tried to expand the jeyne westerling character but she was just a little too bland and dragged down pacing robb could have benefited from some late season scenes that didnt involve her also not a fan of how they wrapped up the winterfell plotline with the castle randomly being burnt with no explanation oh well still season one wasnt perfect either as a television show though probably slightly better and there were a lot of positives in season 2 from the whole blackwater episode to theons capture of winterfell to some wonderful scenes with tyrion varys and bronn and jon and ygritte i loved the pairing of arya and tywin and the interaction between her and jaqen hgar davos was written and acted very well jaime and brienne have excellent chemistry and i cant wait to see more of them in season 3 so many scenes character moments and lines of dialogue that i was happy to see on screen overall theyve done a very good job with this adaptation sure its not the best television show ever but im not too sure you could make the best television show ever out of these books especially acok which is in many ways the most difficult to adapt of the first three books and looking back on this season in a few months i think im much more likely to remember dinklages awesome line readings those are some brave men at our gates lets go kill them and theons botched killing of rodrik than i will i am the mother of dragons which is to say that the positives definitely outweigh the negatives finally from the perspective of an adaptation they really nailed the themesfeel of the books while staying very close to the overall plot and true to who the characters are in the books which is what matters to me and for every change that didnt work there were three that did more importantly i nearly always understood why the changes had to be made to adapt the show to tv even when they didnt work which is important to me edited by caligulak2 05 june 2012  0148 am"
"Howdyphillip",2012-06-05,"the difference is that most of those changes didnt dramatically impact the fifty or so minutes they were contained within as each episoded progressed this season we saw the writing become worse and worse the acting more droll and truly interesting and fascinating moral issues dropped at the slight of a prostitutes skant chance of nudity it was hard to watch whereas most of season one felt like they had made  at the very least  an effort to faithfully adapt the seriesthis was not the story last year the story was that the show had been ruined because of the changesthat story was led by the loud minority just as this years reactions of disgust is held by the minority the fact of the matter is that the vast majority of the people who watched the show absolutely loved itthis is not to take away what anyone feels about the show there are people here that have been fans of these books for over 10 years that have been coming to this sight or its predecessor to talk about them we have all earned the right to have an opinion"

"Frost_Nocturne",2012-06-05,"oh i dont know exactly where i would put it as a grade b i suppose as someone else said the acting gets an a and the story get a d the first 8 episodes are a disjointed mess of great individual scenesi think much of the problems with this season can be traced back to the removal of riverrun and storms end i dont object to these things being changed just because they are changed but look at the ripple effect caused by itstorms end renly gets his entire force moved from bitterbridge to an ambiguous location in the stormlands renly doesnt cut off the food supply coming from the reach to kl until magically in the riot episode the people are starving even though they werent this also causes renly to never divide his forces which then makes it really confusing just how the tyrells ended up with an army to help the lannisters the scenes involving the shadow baby get juggled out of order which ruins renlys death scene after renly dies stannis has nothing to do without storms end to take and thus drops off the screen for a couple of episodes one side of your epic battle shouldnt be off screen for multiple episodesriverrun the show has to be incredibly vague about what robb is doing in the early part of the season cat has to be able to get back to robb since she has no where else to go consequently we get no sense of wtf robb is actually doing hes just off somewhere fighting random lannisters that have no bearing on the story so he just becomes irrelevant robb has to cart jaime around with him and without cats home castle to escape from his escape becomes somewhat of a mess without riverrun to stop him tywin just has to sit at harrenhal the whole time this causes all kinds of problems tywinarya which was one of the strong points of the season has to drag on for too long and then end without any satisfaction tywin has to leave for kl at the last minute for no other reason than to fake out the audiencei can understand why they had to cut riverrun from this season if you have riverrun you have to cast the tullys and theres already too many new characters this season i get why they had to do it and i think they compensated for it as best they could storms end on the other hand the story never goes inside the castle its just a damn matte painting its one of those things that superficially sounds smart to cut if we get rid of it then we only have one shadow baby itll save us lots of time and exposition but it didnt save any time it just caused scenes to be shuffled around for less effect and then stannis to have nothing to dothen we have the lack of build up to the kl riot and blackwater i think often in adaptations tptb identify the most difficult parts of the story and put a huge amount of energy into making those things work in this case danys arc and then they somewhat take for granted the best parts of the story i think these guys were so amped up for blackwater that they forgot to amp the audience up for it they just took for granted that the audience would be amped up too and totally dropped the ball working towards it in the early part of the season a lot of this again has to do with both robb and renly just fucking around in tents all season without acting like any threat to kl but they never have the lannisters in kl actually worried about being attacked in the first half of the season i am totally okay with the chain not being in the battle but if you take the preparations of the chain out then you have to replace that with something that shows tyrion getting the city ready over the course of the season you cant have him suddenly realize the city might be attacked halfway through if the characters arent worried about an attack then the audience wont be either the choice of having joffrey threatening the whores in private with the crossbow rather than showing him actually shooting peasants who are at his gates demanding food just highlights the messed up priorities of tptb this seasonwith all of that said i think the show juggled dany and jons story arcs pretty well i know that not everyone is happy with them but consider danys story in the book which goes something like this sit on ass in red waste sit on ass in vaes tolorro sit on ass in qarth being a tourist attraction omg hotu holy shit selmy i was pleasantly surprised they made it work as well as they did after stumbling at the gates of qarth pretty badly it gives me hope they can make her story work going forward i was upset they killed irri but if you can surprise and upset a bookreader with a death i call that a winthe ending well in a perfect world i would have preferred to see it just end with the 3 horn blasts however i dont think were going to actually see the battle in s3 ep1 i think sam will probably just come in after it is over they arent going to blow the budget in the first episode so doing it this way gives us some real picture of the scope of what happens since its a lot cheaper to have a couple wws just basically sitting on a horse and some extras walking than a big fight sequence also its kind of a nice parallel to the end of last season which ended with the nw riding out in force beyond the wall this season ends with the wws riding out in force to meet themcompletely agree with all of this one of the major missteps of this season imo was the lack of specifics regarding the war when your tagline is war is coming and then you dont even explain what the hell robb is doing the entire season regarding the war hes fighting or where he even is there is a problem they promised to give us more robb screentime this season unlike the book and it was a waste a scene that perfectly highlights this issue is the shows version of the stannisrenly parley which comes out of nowhere and includes virtually none of the relevant military details from the booki do think they at least built up the riot a bit with lfs line in ep 1 about the starving peasants and then tyrions encounter with the demon monkey preaching commoner in ep 5 but mentioning that renlys army was cutting off their food supply was such a simple thing that they still failed to do and yes tyrion suddenly deciding to read up on siege warfare the episode before blackwater was far too little too latemore battle planning scenes and less pointless nudity please they should be catering to the observant viewers who appreciate intelligent television not the casuals who are in for spartacus blood and sex"
"Frost_Nocturne",2012-06-05,"i would give this season a b as a whole with season 1 as a strong a without blackwater saving it the season would drop to a c there were only two other episodes all season that were onpar with the quality of s1 3 and 5 bryan cogman knows what hes doing unlike dampd who seem to have too little time to give proper focus to characters in their episodes and like to push the unnecessary nudityoverall locationsarcs ratingskl mostly faithful to the book which helped given it was the big focus of the season aarya yoren gendry and jaqen were all perfect along with maisie herself the battle in ep 3 was a bit messy but yorens performance helped redeem it the aryatywin scenes were fun but the problem is that they took away from the cruelty she experienced firsthand during her entire time at harrenhal in the book that hardens and embitters her going on still sad that weasel soup was cut but a man was pleased with her scene in the finale with jaqen b needed more screentimerobbcatelyn d they took away cats agency while making robb even more of an idiot and a jerk than the book version while subjecting us to terrible forced romantic scenes without explaining his war campaign in even minor detail not to mention the plot hole of giving catelyn a real reason to release jaime better than the book version imo and then seemingly hoping everyone would forget about it when catelyn never explains her reasons to robb when theyre alone so glad they added roose bolton this season though it made every scene with him in it worth ittheonwinterfellbran b alfie allen was fantastic and the scene of theon taking wf in ep 6 was one of the best moments of the entire show but they really fucked up the conclusion to this arc otherwise this would be an easy a not only is theon brought low by someone elses plan instead of his own foolishness as in the books trusting reek instead of his men betraying him after hearing robbs offer but we get no resolution on the bastard of bolton or who burned wf also the burning of bran and rickon could have been handled better to make it more believable for one by waiting until episode 10 to do the reveal which gives luwins death more meaning as welljon d the biggest letdown of the season they completely butchered jons mentorapt pupil relationship with qhorin as well as butchering qhorin as a character entirely in favor of pointless scenes of walking around with ygritte talking about genitals they made jon go from naive but full of potential in s1 to a complete idiot in s2dany c she really had only two good episodes this season 5 and 10 yes the hotu could have been better but it worked for a tv audience the dragons burning pyat pree and her locking xxd and doreah in the vault were a bit cheesy however the final scene of raiding the palace was a decent finish though thankfully those were her major episodes but the writing and clarkes acting in almost every other scene was painful to watch particularly the gates of qarth scene in ep 4 god that was bad also did they really have to kill off rakharo and irri the latter not even getting a proper sendoffstannis and co b needed more screentime leading up to blackwater storms endcortnay penrose should not have been cut davos and melisandre are portrayed fantastically but they really screwed up stannis character in the finale with him choking mel and admitting he knows he murdered his brotherjaimebrienne not much to go off of but what theyve done with these characters this season has been reasonable i will also say jaimes scenes were the highlight of ep 7 for me great interaction between the characters in the two scenes theyve had together which gives me confidence about next season aoverall some of this season was poor because they needed more time other things due to lazybad writing the acting is almost always excellent thankfully and others due to poor allocation of screentime please die ros its still better than 95 of television and was a very enjoyable ride but overall a bit of a disappointment compared to season 1 hopefully upon future viewings my opinion will improve as my inner book reader voicecritic cools off im hopeful that splitting sos into 2 seasons will be give us the focus we need on each character and storyline and im predicting this will turn out to be a very good decision just hoping they end with the purple wedding edited by frostnocturne 05 june 2012  0527 am"

"Rockroi",2012-06-20,"so this is not a very easy question as it involves a varying metric after all by what measurement do you use to judge game of thrones season ii for me its this did what i watch entertain me did i enjoy itbecause the show is an adaptation i cannot really just ask did it stay truthful to the books because there is no way you could budget time and cast make that impossible i think we have to use our eyes did what we see make us want to see more and did we enjoy what we sawwith thatoverall grade bwhy i gave game of thrones season ii a b because i very much enjoyed what they actually put on the screen when the show tackled a story it did so with thought purpose and intelligence the show was able to take us from neds death all the way through the blackwater and in doing so gave us enough though just enough of each character to make them all seem real and tethered to the story the highlightstyrion season cannot work without the central character for the story to revolve around and peter dinkledges tyrion lannister is  in many ways the perfect character for the story he is in he rivals al swearengen in deadwood the entire story deflates into a confabulation of disparate parts but for tyrion the riot the taming of joffery the playing with baelishpycellvarys and especially the blackwater all work because tyrion worksstannis every good story needs a villain and although stannis is more the de facto villain than a real archenemy he scares the hell out of so many characters that he gets the mantle even by default stannis had major growing pains but in the end when he stormed that beach we all stormed it with him blackwater the episode that is almost universally hailed as the highpoint of the show or its saving throw as it were only works because we believe in stannis for better the fans or worse the producersthe queen maegery tyrell was a bright shinning surprise in season two much in the same way mark addy greatly improved upon robert and harry loyd made a two dimensional viserys into a threedimensional lunatic natalie dormers magaery is complex hungry driven and all out unlike other characters who try to balance desires and duties aegery tyrell in game of thrones combines them all into one sharp point its her duty to be queen i said it many times but margery tyrell is in it to win it and its an incredible character developmentthe iron islands i never expected to like or appreciate the story of the iron isles given their treatment in affc but the actors and dialog not only made them palatable but enjoyable listening to theon frantically decry where he is because of his fathers failure was a moment i had been waiting for over 12 years and 5 books finally somebody said what we were all thinking balon greyjoy sucks and yet the actor who played balonw as brilliant the most impressive moment is when theon is yelling at balon the camera freezes on the seachair kings face and its one of regret and painpace the pace of the season was very good it did not dwell too much on one or two characters and provided the space to see all we needed to see there were very few slow spotstywin and arya the best new show on cable would have been tywin lannister talking to various westeroes characters while arya laughs at how stupid they all look here we saw the grafting of a new story on the body of the old and how incredibly intricate these two people were as they intersected each other tywins coldness and aloofness combined with aryas down and dirty lifestyle what could have been dead or confusing air was instead a masterstrokethe blackwater i could either write a 45 paragraph treatise on why blackwater worked or just say this without the blackwater season ii would have been a disaster stannis tyrion joff cersei and the battles and cgi enhanced the season mightily in just 55 minutes it workedwhy not a better grade if season two suffered from any sin it was the fragmentation of the story before we could really come and enjoy one area we were immediately dragged off to face another this clearly hurt stannis and mel the greatest people are still unsure if she really believes in stannis or is in his thrall as so much story had to be churned out we got a disparate mix of the wall and then the stormlands and then kings landing and then east most of the time it worked but far too often it felt like you were watching a show go through a blender as some psychotic chef yelled quick look at how the peaches go with the ice quick you might miss it i thoygh the show wasted time on either a characters we did not care about or b  story lines that took up far far too much space overall season two was far more uneven than season one for better or worse season twos highpoint blackwater was far greater than anything in season one however here are some stark examples of how the story flounderedcatlyn stark its not that she was bad its more like catlyn represents the well she has to be here problems of making a tv show with a carryover cast in cok cat does not really take any actions until the very tail end her presence with renly is just an excuse for the reader to see stannis and renly when bran and rickon are killed but her interaction with jaime was bifurcated between the end of s1 and the end of s2 and so it lost its intensity jaime is basically lost in season 2 much as he was in the cok and when she does show up its with robb and therefore robbs story suffers because instead of a rash move in marrying jayne westerling robb just looks like an idiot when his mother is telling him how stupid he is being but he does it anyway in marrying the volantis woman i think the show did not know what to do with cat and it cost themjon snow no character seemed so utterly perplexed by his own existence than jon snow jon seemed to bumble from place to place before the writers gave him his legs back and had him kill halfhand prior to that it was a bad romantic comedy where the young teenager does not want to have an erection near a girl girls are icky the show lost so much time in trying to get jon by making him this comic fool it was all wrong felt wrong and looked wrongdany ughh maybe the biggest miscalculation of the season was enlarging danys footprint in the season when her presence in cok is minor the show made her do too much take on too much and take way way wayyyyyy too much time away from other characters a massive and hopeless time sinc that wasted away many valable minutes from other spaces the show could have spent that time maybe the most terrible example is the enlargement of the king of qarth storyline and how completely pointless it all was an utter failure bottom line season two had great highs and very deep lows the unevenness of the whole story left us either overstuffed of starving for substance the decision to expand dany and then lose jon were tragic miscalculations however tyrion stannis and his cast and the injection of some much needed interaction of characters most notably tywin and arya gave us more than enough to declare season two a success edited by rockroi 20 june 2012  0954 am"
"Blutrabe",2012-06-20,"season 1just for the record i dont believe that the changes from this season screwed up anything in the long run and i dont hold the ideas behind most of these but last year at this time these were the things people were saying about season 1now everyone is giving season 1 an athey completely changed the characters of ned and catelyn when they reversed the positions of who wanted to go to kings landing and who wanted to staythey robbed the hound of every significant line his character hadthey created the character of ros out of thin air and she took up valuable screen time from what the real story wasthey made ned stark look like some kind of a cage fighter by having him fight jaime in the streetsvarrys was much too effeminatethey ruined the characters of renly and loras by making them gaythey completely cut the toj dream sequence and now the viewer will never understand about rljthey made littlefinger a pimpthey made pycelle a whoremongermark addy was a terrible choice for robert because he looked nothing like himjust a little reminder for those that are throwing fits about the changes in season 2these changes are relatively minor for the most part and renlys relationship with loras is heavily implied in the books now compare them to the changes they made in s2  thats a whole new dimension and its not the fact that they made changes that most book fans are complaining about its clear that they have to change stuff for budgetary and production reasons eg delay the introduction of some characters etc and to streamline the story a bit in order to fit it into 10 hours and make it more accessible for the audience but there can hardly be an excuse for changing a characters personalisation motivations and development in a way that makes less sense than in the source material and could easily have been avoided that happened a lot more often in this season than in the first"
"mooksman",2012-06-20,"yeah what those other guys said the scene could have been a powerful choice if they hadnt been so sloppy about it the set up was just inconsistent instead of getting caught up in the emotion of the scene i was being trying to figure out how rodrik was captured and what the hell the iron price comment was supposed to mean thats a common problem in the show imo one of its greatest sins is just letting things get away from it the books are so compelling and gripping partly because the characters are fleshed out and consistent and the situations are clearly defined within a world with structure and rules you understand the biggest scene in the series the red wedding is all the more powerful because you know the hierarchy of westeros and where the starks and freys stand and how walder frey would take such an insult little nuances like the westerlings being exactly the type of family the freys would especially take offense from add more and more exponentially that way when something happens its already been set up so well its pretty much allll impact in the show theres always a hasty explanation if anything and then a pale imitation of the scene from the book usually contradicting something that happened before a lot of this is just pointing out that its incredibly difficult for something to be translated between mediums especially to a medium like television which lives and dies on how many people watch it each week so it has to be immediately gratifying its just a shame that millions of people will watch the red wedding and think oh thats too bad then change the channel when reading that scene in the book was basically like the mountain punching me in the gut gauntlets on ruining my night but hey i guess those people wouldnt have read it anyway"

know where to begin how about a vulnerable attractive woman who wanders the battlefields of westeros yeaaah she wouldnt be raped and killed at all oh and how about robb letting this random woman wander in on his war councils where all his esteemed bannerman have to up and leave the moment she arrives not only that but robb later decides he wants to make this damsel his bride because the poor idiots in love and he wants to get back at mummy for upsetting him is this game of thrones or an emily giffin novel littlefinger  theyve turned the character into a snidely whiplash villain who must be shoehorned into as many scenes as possible even when it means doing stupid acts like calling out cersei or venturing into enemy camps also is it me or has aidan gillen suddenly forgotten how to act from his hammy delivery and messed up accent to his facial expressions hes like a whole different character brienne of tarth  more like the mountain with breasts amirite she looks and acts like some crazy psycho bitch instead of the naive idealistic knight we all know remember how briennes first kill was a big deal to her in the books now she just butchers men before theyve even took up arms weasel soup  even though i loved the chemistry between charles dance  maisie williams the scenes started to drag on after while and did nothing to advance the plot harrenhall was supposed to be a defining moment in aryas development as she went through hell and back and came of age instead she spends most of season 2 being tywins cosy little cupbearer and uses jaqen to do all her dirty work for her the mountain  oh dear lord why did they cast such a complete noodle to play the role of ser gregor the man carries no presence whatsoever and his voice is downright cringeworthy conan stevens wont be coming back from the sounds of it so id nominate someone like nathan jones make it happen hbo otherwise the fight with the red viper is going to blow hard ros  i dont understand why this characters eats up so much screentime i guess she worked as the goto whore for character sexposition but even that was overplayed now its hinted shell play an even larger role her scene with varys in s2 ep10 felt like a lame attempt to force us into accepting her character shae  i dont know how people prefer tv shae ill probably get shot for this but is it the profeminist stance towards all the female characters on this show that wins people over they all have to be headstrong girlfriends when that simply doesnt fly in grrms world tv shaes more like tyrions nagging housewife than his dirty secret and sibel kekilli is possibly the weakest cast member on the show bronn  i know bronn has something of a chuck norrisstatus within the fanbase but they really went too far this season hes made commander of the city watch he can read he can sing oh and to top it off he was the archer who set the blackwater ablaze as well and took time out to save sandors life is there anything he cant do hes supposed to be a common sellsword not the six million dollar man no shagga son of dolf  the pycelle scene wasnt the same without himi could really go on but this rant needs to end sometime todayso what did i enjoy about season 2 naturally i thought the blackwater episode was a glorious spectacle and almost made up for all the mediocrity that came before it until we got to the final episode i think aside from one or two niggles gregor asha hbos casting has been topnotch again and on a whole the acting remains aboveaveragewhere i was looking forward to season 2 i have now trepidation

know where to begin how about a vulnerable attractive woman who wanders the battlefields of westeros yeaaah she wouldnt be raped and killed at all oh and how about robb letting this random woman wander in on his war councils where all his esteemed bannerman have to up and leave the moment she arrives not only that but robb later decides he wants to make this damsel his bride because the poor idiots in love and he wants to get back at mummy for upsetting him is this game of thrones or an emily giffin novel littlefinger  theyve turned the character into a snidely whiplash villain who must be shoehorned into as many scenes as possible even when it means doing stupid acts like calling out cersei or venturing into enemy camps also is it me or has aidan gillen suddenly forgotten how to act from his hammy delivery and messed up accent to his facial expressions hes like a whole different character brienne of tarth  more like the mountain with breasts amirite she looks and acts like some crazy psycho bitch instead of the naive idealistic knight we all know remember how briennes first kill was a big deal to her in the books now she just butchers men before theyve even took up arms weasel soup  even though i loved the chemistry between charles dance  maisie williams the scenes started to drag on after while and did nothing to advance the plot harrenhall was supposed to be a defining moment in aryas development as she went through hell and back and came of age instead she spends most of season 2 being tywins cosy little cupbearer and uses jaqen to do all her dirty work for her the mountain  oh dear lord why did they cast such a complete noodle to play the role of ser gregor the man carries no presence whatsoever and his voice is downright cringeworthy conan stevens wont be coming back from the sounds of it so id nominate someone like nathan jones make it happen hbo otherwise the fight with the red viper is going to blow hard ros  i dont understand why this characters eats up so much screentime i guess she worked as the goto whore for character sexposition but even that was overplayed now its hinted shell play an even larger role her scene with varys in s2 ep10 felt like a lame attempt to force us into accepting her character shae  i dont know how people prefer tv shae ill probably get shot for this but is it the profeminist stance towards all the female characters on this show that wins people over they all have to be headstrong girlfriends when that simply doesnt fly in grrms world tv shaes more like tyrions nagging housewife than his dirty secret and sibel kekilli is possibly the weakest cast member on the show bronn  i know bronn has something of a chuck norrisstatus within the fanbase but they really went too far this season hes made commander of the city watch he can read he can sing oh and to top it off he was the archer who set the blackwater ablaze as well and took time out to save sandors life is there anything he cant do hes supposed to be a common sellsword not the six million dollar man no shagga son of dolf  the pycelle scene wasnt the same without himi could really go on but this rant needs to end sometime todayso what did i enjoy about season 2 naturally i thought the blackwater episode was a glorious spectacle and almost made up for all the mediocrity that came before it until we got to the final episode i think aside from one or two niggles gregor asha hbos casting has been topnotch again and on a whole the acting remains aboveaveragewhere i was looking forward to season 2 i have now trepidation towards season 3 dd  co need to remember what made the original series such a roaring success and stop writing this terrible fanfictionyour introductory paragraph here applies to me 100 as well i agree with everything else you wrote so much that i wont even bother reading the other 8 pages of responses you nailed it my only small objection is to littlefingers acting i just didnt notice it i hate that the mountain in season one is like a 63 mass of a man while season twos is a 610 pushoverpersonally i wont grant a single excuse for the shows shortcomings book 1 being 1 season on tv made perfect sence however book 2 and book 3 should be 2 a piece and i figure 3 seasons between books 4 and 5 since books 4 and 5 are basically 1 giant book anywayin the preview for season 3 dd even say that season 3 is the one they had been most looking forward to and its clear that they rushed to get there i get that they have creative liberty and that as grrm has said they could have aliens come down from space and take the iron throne if they so wanted but instead of taking creative liberty it seems they have take uncreative liberties and short cuts instead"

"Currawong",2012-06-05,"i can understand the concerns that we are just being shown badass brienne as a simplified character but i think we have to give some thoughts to the problems facing the writers herethe trouble with adapting book brienne for tv is that so much of what we learn about her and her background in thebooks is only through her povs in affc and showing internal povs is incredibly difficult unless you have a lot of time to spend with an individual character and show them agonising over their actions or whatever which they cannot do given the time limits of episodes or are able to do some sort of exposition scene arrange for her to have a reasonable dialogue with someone etc catelyn in the books commented about the walls that brienne had erected around herself and how little she showed to others and even book brienne is certainly not about to confide her insecurities to jaime lannister right nowso how exactly are the writers going to show tv viewers that killing people was a big deal for her lets face it  she was quite prepared to heave a boulder onto a pursuing boat full of soldiers when that could have killed or injured some of them so even book brienne is prepared to kill at ths stage and outwardly book brienne does appear to be just a rather taciturn person yet extremely competent when it comes to action which is what jaime first notices about her whenhe reads her eyes and sees she is not panicking but assessing options when the galley is pursuing them if we simply look at what we see about brienne in the books at this stage we really wouldnt get anything about her inner issuesi am hoping that the writers will be able to show us some of her inner complexities and softer side once she and jaime get captured by the bloody mummers and he loses his hand then there will be an opportunity for them to show her gentle side in caring for him and possibly have some additional dialogue between them as they start to understand each other better it woud make dramatic sense to have some of her pov background we get in affc brought forward to conversations with jaime we have already seen her loyalty and determination so giving us badass warrior brienne at first should set up a nice contrast for later brienne well i hope it does edited by currawong 05 june 2012  1026 am"

"Elba the Intoner",2012-06-05,"i totally agree with scabbard of the morning and tenlaar for the record i do think that the casting of these two is fantastic and they already have a great repor that i cant wait to see play out next season though as someone else noted i want to hear jaime call her wench i didnt even have much of an issue with brienne killing the guards per se as it was necessary but the way she killed the third one drawing out his death to make it painful and slow was just not brienne she would never do something like that even if it was in retaliation for what the guard did to one of the tavern wenches she should have made a point of saying to him that a quick death is more than he deserves for what he did but she is not like him and therefore she will give him a quick death having her give him a slow and painful death was just so wrong"

"Sand11751",2012-06-05,"the kill may be more cruel but in her pov shes meriting out justice to a man who did not give his victim a slow death she paid him back in kind on behalf of a possible innocent i have no problem with it"

"Silmarien",2012-06-05,"i thought their scene was beautifully done yet again these two have had less than 10 minutes of screentime together so far but have been knocking it out of the freaking park their storyline next season promises great thingsive seen a complaint or two about showbrienne being a little more brutal than bookbrienne at this point but i think it worked in this scene the third guy she gave a slower death to had been laughing  taunting the loudest and he was the one who insinuated a slow painful death for the third woman brienne was extracting a little vengeance on behalf of the innocentsjaimes reaction when she unleashed was what i really enjoyed the kingslayer himself jaw dropped and speechless awesomeif they dont backtrack to the river and give us the rygerstark chase next season im glad they introduced an element of teamwork in this scene in the book jaime distracts ryger so brienne can get to the top of the hill without being brought down by the archers here it was jaime covering for her by annoucing himself a pig thief when she got stuck and her following along with the charade immediately these two are just fun and incidentally it would be fantastic if they do backtrack them to the river so brienne can drop a few rocks smilepng classbbcemoticon alt well said i think brienne was getting justice for those 3 women not vengeance so it fits better with her character than just her randomly killing some dudes just imho"
"Jolene Brown",2012-06-05,"she does cut off timeons hand and thinks about how it is for jaime and kills shagwell brutally in affc but i think that is specifically because of how what she endures with jaime at their hands has changed her and shagwell in particular was one of those who threatened to rape her most frequently and totally grossly she also ends up sobbing and shuddering though not for long once the killing of shagwell is done having her be so brutal now just totally misses the point"
"Currawong",2012-06-05,"but once again by suggesting that they are missing the point you completely ignore the many difficulties of transferring internal book brienne pov to the screen yes they may eventually show her shuddering and sobbing after she kills shagwell in affc but stop and think about how that scene would appear onscreen to tv viewers  it could just be anyones normal reaction to killing in a sudden violent fight it wouldnt seem like it was anything particular to internal gentle brienne"

"Will&Chrismom",2012-06-17,"im new here hope i can crash the party brienne is my favorite character bar none and i am going to respectfully disagree with those who have a problem with how she is presented in the show i agree 100 with the writers decision to present brienne as an alreadyhardened warrior in the show i think it makes perfect sense given the plot and character development constraints of a 10episode season that must also devote adequate time to multiple other characters and plot lines i think the writers wanted to quickly establish jaimes conflicting feelings about brienne and the best way to show that as opposed to tell it courtesy of jaimes inner monologue over the course of many chapters in storm of swords is for brienne to be a bad ass i dont think either that brienne comes off as a senseless killing machine i think her fury at the one stark guy and her method of killing him was not so much about avenging the three dead whoresalthough that was certainly part of itbut also a way to avenge all women everywhere in general and herself in particular who has been the butt of the joke jaimes expression says it all he is not only impressed with brienne he is also a little afraid of her and a little admiring of her and in the end his expression rightly shows that his feelings for her have suddenly changed and this confuses him i also have the sense that the writers are working brienne in reverse making her hardened in the beginning as a result of dealing with a maledominated world that mocks doubts and scorns her at every turn and allowing her to soften and show some vulnerability as her relationship with jaime changes and deepens i think tvwise it will be more satisfying and work better visually and dramatically for jaime and brienne to kind of undo each other"

"boojam",2012-06-04,"ive been a little confused regarding the tie between the fm and the red god on the shows i know in the book when jaqen and arya first talk about the three deaths that are owed he mentions the red god but in context that makes sense because the three lives saved were about to die by fire whats with this latest mention of the red god in this episode is the show telling us that the fm worship the red god in the books it seems as if they worship all the gods equally because it is said that they are all really the same god or something like that not a big deal just wanted to see if anyone else noticed the same tie they are trying to make on the show between the fm and red god and if that tie is implied in the books i dont think somy feeling is that  writing time wise george when he got to writing about the details of fm  he kinda forgot about some of the things jaqen had said in cok the horse was out of the barn  he was not going to go back and rewrite jaqens dialog"

"sarah.jenice",2012-06-05,"like the majority of book readers i was disappointed in the danys visit to the house the undying but after thinking long and hard about why the changes were made ive come up with a couple of possible reasons other than budget and time1 we can see everything  the fact that we can actually see what dany does instead of just getting her description could make her visions much more obvious which would ruin the effect for most of the viewers because we would know exactly what is happening or who it is showing dany doesnt recognize the majority of the people she sees so we dont know what the visions mean at that point for example in the rw vision the northmen have pretty recognizable costumes and so when we saw people in those particular costumes butchered and grey winds head on a body that looks like what robb wears wed know who was dead in the vision of king aerys we would recognize jamie lannister when she sees rhaegar die and he whispers a womans name we could hear him say the name she just says a womans name because she doesnt recognize the name but we would the corpse at the prow of the ship the blueeyed king proof that its stannis and the beast that breathes shadow fire a griffin  all of these could be identified by book readers and maybe george doesnt want that clear of confirmation at this point2 nonbook readers probably wouldnt understand most of it  most of the visions wouldnt be clear to nonreaders they dont know anything about the blue rose or rhaegars rubies or his potential lyanna relationshipi think they chose visions that could be identified by tvviewers but perhaps express the overall meaning of what dany needs to know which is perhaps what independent george said earlier  i think its more that when winter comes the game of thrones ceases to matter when the long night comes kings and peasants will dies just the same and the iron throne is just another uncomfortable chair in just another ruini do think they could have at least said the dragon has three heads and included the statements that they say that didnt have visions  three fires three treasons and three mountsi am hopeful that this will be rectified by having quaithe tell dany these things before they leave qarth it could work with her saying it and she has established herself as a more trustworthy person to receive prophecy from while the undying were complete villains in the show edited by sarahjenice 05 june 2012  0942 am"

"WolveseatDragons",2012-06-05,"i certainly understand why there was no rw vision and im fine with it the rw is already going to be very hard to keep a secret to viewers i do agree an aerys scene would have been nails and i dont think it would have confused viewers a rhaegar scene at the trident would have also reminded viewers that the past is very important in the story and it wouldnt have been too confusing i absolutely hated the drogo scene not only because it was added but because it served no real purpose honestly it felt like something out of twilight or some other romancethriller movie and was a sellout a blue rose in the wall also would have confused viewers but that isnt such a terrible thing it confused readers the first time as well isnt part of the point to get people thinking about the show because it is so complex i was really outraged that they didnt have the 3s mentioned because that would have required no real imagery pyatt pree could have said them then as i thought about it i realized that the reason was they had written themselves into a corner with the dragon stealing in the book dany goes to the hotu for knowledge but in the show she only goes for her dragons they didnt even have her drink shade of the evening which i thought was just lazy writing and it would have made the images more interesting and made non fantasy folks more comfortable because it would be a is this real or a dream as a story however since the plot in the show was dany just wanted her dragons back and just as importantly the warlocks only wanted to imprison dany it made it pointless for them to give her any future prophecies because according to the warlocks she was always just going to be imprisoned so in the end the problems with the hotu are butterfly effect from pulling the dragon stealing card they were written into a corner and had to make more changes to make up for the earlier changes my guess is that quaithe will end up getting on the ship with dany and have a larger role in prophecies to fill in the gaps"

"Ser Greguh",2012-06-05,"i very much enjoyed the hotu scene in the show precisely because it didnt attempt to put together a halfassed version of an unfilmable scene the chaotic prophecy infodump is a trope that just works much better in prose than it ever could on the screen and any vision that attempted to match the scene as described in the books would have never worked for any purpose other than to appease the purists same with flashbacks the logistical difficulties aside casting actors finding locations getting the look right theyre the sort of thing that needs the right buildup in order to be effective and as heavy as the show has been in exposition we just dont have enough of the backstory to justify stranding a flashback in the middle of nowhere as doing so would result in 90 of the viewers being completely lostyes the history of the story is important rhaegar lyanna elia aerys and others that were dead before the series ever began were important characters but theres a reason why the word adaptation comes from the root to adapt which means to change and asking the audience to keep track of a host of characters  i honestly think the vast majority of the people here have no freaking clue just how difficult the task is that dd have hereand i kind of liked the presentation of 3 possible futures one with dany in the throne room but with it in ashes and snow falling from the sky one with her at the wall seeming a little lost and alone and one of her with drogo living out her life as a khaleesi of the dothraki theyve introduced qaithe so they do have an outlet to bring any more prophecies  visions that they want in the future as they see fit and have time for but insofar as danys visions are important to her story they havent been important to her story yet the only real tangible result thusfar has been her constant worrying about where her next treason will come from so to me its not important that they happen here"

"Lord of Cheese",2012-06-06,"i dont think its a vision of the future if she does such and such so its just outright false to suggest its a prophecy of winter winning the war against fire and that she therefore shouldnt strive for the throne she does need to be ruthless to get the throne and she will have to sacrifice many lives to get it the vision is just not useful information to her in any way she does not give up her quest for the throne in the books although she appears distracted atm so showing her a frozen ruin is kinda useless and doesnt fit the story to come the vision is more to make her stay in the hotu to be trapped"
"BlackTalon",2012-06-06,"i very much enjoyed the hotu scene in the show precisely because it didnt attempt to put together a halfassed version of an unfilmable scene the chaotic prophecy infodump is a trope that just works much better in prose than it ever could on the screen and any vision that attempted to match the scene as described in the books would have never worked for any purpose other than to appease the puriststhank you for saving me the effort of typing out precisely the same answer someone ought to tell linda  jeez yeah i did like the image a lot were there brazier type things attached to the pillars in the throne room given the whole fire kills wights thing i figured that was some kind of defence against the wights and the cold itself but then the roof was burnt off which kinda suggested dragon firehuh those clearly are the same braziers that joffrey had added to the throne room when he was redecorating in the scene whee he was slapped by cersei they had fires burning in those braziers in pretty much every throne room scene since btw in the scene in the hotu you can clearly see that there are icicles on one of the braziers it is definitly snow and not ashes that are falling edited by blacktalon 06 june 2012  0522 am"

"Blangadanger",2012-06-06,"anyone else think that the three scenes in her dream were representative of the past present and future drogo being the past she couldve had the present where the wall is being overtaken by winter and the future being when the iron throne stands in ruin but since it was displayed in reverse order i took it to mean that pyat wanted her to dwell on the past rather than continue on her journey into the future i think danys scene with drogo was very instrumental in helping her tvcharacter understand that it is time to take control over her own destiny and that destiny is fire and blood she knows that her future will bring death to many but she accepts it as truth of her own identity shes been saying a lot since she birthed the dragons but it wasnt until she escapes the dreams of the houses of the undying that she takes action is it anything like the book not really but do i think its meaningless absolutely not"

"MysteriousStranger08",2012-06-09,"personally i thought the whole scene with drogo considering that she had to walk through the wall to get to him suggests that her family lies beyond the wallat the wall ie jon i like the idea that having a vision of drogo is showing dany the life she couldbe had and for her to break away from the past and move forward but im just wondering if there was a little bit of symbolism there as for the iron throne difficult to interpret but the idea of snow on the iron throne is probably the most prevalent im guessing that its also foreshadowing the white walkers invasion of westeros linking in with the idea of going beyond the wall aswell yes its a pity we didnt have all the other visions and the three betrayels but i suppose they can come later through quaithe or something like that while it wasnt fantastic the hotu wasnt as bad as it couldve been"

"SerMilady",2012-07-18,"i definitely think they should keep theons fate up in the air for as long as possible so just past the rw if we assume it takes place in 3x07 or 3x08 we hear the real deal from roose and he presents them with his piece of prince then in the penultimate episode of the third season or so we get a look into the dreadfort dungeons and see oh an old man no wait is that is that theon greyjoy door squeals open etc etc then have the kyra situation happen in the season finale before those scenes we should just be hearing different stories from different characters let them confuse the viewers a bit edited by sermilady 18 july 2012  0655 am"

"Lord Varys",2012-06-04,"the stupid thing here is that ros did not turn out to be in varyss employ all along this would have been a rather interesting twist and would have explained why she was with so many important people in the first season tyrion theon littlefinger pycelle no idea what varys wants with ros now but its evident that they are intending to prepare us for some kind of littlefingervarysbitchwar in season 3 remember varyss face when littlefinger was made lord of harrenhal i dont have high hopes on that one since it has much potential to suck completely they will certainly enhance varyss role in seasons 3  4 varys has a very low profile in asos so there will be much invented stuff i guess on the other hand they will have time enough to give us some of his back story the cutting and something about his modus operandi and possibly his motivations and as soon as littlefinger leaves for the vale the chance for direct clash between these two is gone at least for the near future by the way has anyone noticed that show shae is possibly even more varyss creature than book shae ever was shaes whole suggestion about going to pentos with tyrion was an attempt to recruit him to aegonsdanys directly after the battle and im quite sure that the revelation about ser mandon moore was a lie as well to convince tyrion to forsake his family given the nonsubtleapproaches of the show we can expect some more mischief on that field i can see varys opening tyrion the bedchamber door when he kills tywin and shae "
"Former Lord of Winterfell",2012-06-04,"this is an invented scene but i think a very useful one one of the themes from the book was the behind the scenes duel between littlefinger and varys for powerinfluence ros essentially shows that battle in microcosm varys is trying to steal one of littlefingers informantsallies to add her to his own web and you can see how such machinations would be played out with other birds as well the scene was a way to draw attention to that ongoing chess match and i think it worked"

"WolveseatDragons",2012-06-05,"btw i think roz stays in kl and runs all of lfs business there while he is in the vale that would allow for her to be an information source having half the whores in kl working for her and communicating with lf and lend some ability to fill in gaps for instance i could see varys talking to roz about history and how things came to be as well since he will soon not really have anyone to talk to no one on the small council trusts him or likes him and tyrion is personna non grata of course he will have his official chats but once lf goes to the vale then varys needs someone to talk about what he really thinks i suppose it is also possible that lf sends her to the vale with him to be sansas new handmaidcompanion though but that would be awfully dull one of the best parts of sansa going with lf is she has no one she can trust except lf which she doesnt really trust and she becomes stronger through that adversity"

"Raksha the Demon",2012-06-13,"though ros tits are pretty spectacular i kind of grew tired of them as well and thought she was getting way too much screentime but i think they actually have a good reason for thatthere is sort of an unseen duel between varys and littlfinger the entire series and much of that revolves around their competing networks of spiesinformantscatspaws while the unseen part of it works well in a book i think it loses something when it is brought to the screen ros amounts to a symbol an illustration of that duel its a visual way of letting viewers know not to forget that apart from all the killings and open conflict there is a bunch of unseen conflict hidden beneath the surface varys prying ros away from littlefingers network makes that point very clear if ros goes to the eyrie as well then it will also be a way to show how varys continues to be informed or as was pointed out above it may show how littlefingers power base begins to slip when he goes to the eyrieanyway thats how i see it like i said until that scene i was pretty sick of ros now she has a legitimate plot purpose that strengthens one of the more difficult aspects of trying to bring the novels to the screeni can only hope that with a legitimate plot purpose ros will keep her clothes on next season but im probably being overoptimisticthe main reason ros annoys me is that there are only so many minutes of screen time they can allocate to the zillions of characters in the books most of whom including chataya and alayaya are more interesting than ros and ros who is not even a book character is stealing time they could have given to jeyne poole who has an important role in future seasons in the arcs of the boltons and theon or sandor who was marginalized in the show some of his best lines including his own story given to littlefinger or even patchface and shireen and damphair etci can only hope that ros wont be accompanying sansa to the vale maybe shell already be there as lysas maid and a double agent for varys"
"Former Lord of Winterfell",2012-06-13,"i dont think varys is using the word partner in anything approaching a sense of equality so i wouldnt get hung up on that particular word hes not turning over his network of little birds or all his secrets he simply means that hes going to have a relationship with ros where they both actually get something out of it whereas lf seemed to motivate her mostly by threats"

"StannisandDaeny",2012-06-06,"my thoughts on qarth are divided i loved how it and the people there looked pyat pree was pretty awesome xaro was more memorable than he was in the books in the books hes not memorable at all the stealing of the dragons and murdering of the khalasar and the thirteen added some necessary drama although a slight mention of an uproar should be the least we could expect when a coup suddenly takes place in such a placexaros vault was pretty pointlessthings went sour when they took ages to get to the hotu with little reason to wait i got over the lack of visions but not so much over the much too easy way pyat pree and xaro were beaten getting rid of doreah was perhaps not the best move when youve already killed off all of her other handmaidens xaro also shouldnt have died since you know hes still kickin then theres daenys khalasar dying to be mysteriously resurrected afterwards edited by stannisanddaeny 06 june 2012  0129 pm"

"Khal-a-bunga",2012-06-06,"i must not have had the same problem with the qarth storyline as many here did because i found it to be much more satisfying than her stay there in the novels in the red waste the audience sees that dany isnt suddenly going from powerless to allpowerful simply by the virtue of having dragons at her disposal her people are dying and suffering she loses silver and she has only jorah to truly rely on and carry her through when she comes to the gates of qarth and meets with the thirteen she is denied entry because shes unwilling to use her dragons her children as dany sees it as a bargaining chip xaro then invokes sumai to grant her and her dothraki followers access into the city despite the fact that the other members of the thirteen dont feel the same next we see her with irri who firmly establishes that dany is a khaleesi and not a princess and doreah in her chambers the foreshadowing of dracarys also happens in this scene as well as the setup for doreahs betrayal he loves you men like to talk about other men when theyre happy at the party thrown in danys honor pyat pree mentions that dany should come to the house of the undying jorah then meets quaithe who warns him of the dangers that dany faces in the city as a result of her being the mother of dragons and xaro begins to sow seeds of discontent between dany and jorah after discounting pyat pree as a sham this is also where the vault is introduced and xaros insistence that power resides where men believe it resides begins xaro somewhat like dany came to this city with nothing and has established himself through sheer force of will at the gates of qarth and during her meeting with the spice king dany vows to take what is rightfully her own through virtue of her family history and her dragons she says these things with conviction but also with no true understanding of what it means to wield such power just as the spice king and the rest of the thirteen doubted pyat pree and xaro due to his upbringing xaro and pree doubt dany the difference being unlike xaros empty vault dany does have a true power hidden inside of her that pree monologues about her dragons strengthening his power then tells her that her own power makes the dragons ergo the source of his and the other warlocks powers stronger is ultimately his own undoing which seems less anticlimactic to me and more intentionally ironic when all is said and done dany shows her true strength by ignoring the false visions of power shown to her in the house of the undying the throne representing her future and drogo representing what was and embracing her role as a mother of dragons her remaining dothraki loot xaros own baubles and trinkets mirroring the scene where she forbid kavarro from doing so to purchase a small ship and go on to the next leg of their journey doreah and xaro are locked in his empty vault and the lesson that dany learns isnt dont trust rich people that want to marry you but rather that real power can and does exist inside of her if she can believe in herself and those around her whom she trusts there are plenty of other things that tie this all together and i barely touched upon how danys relationship with jorah is challenged which will give further weight to the relationship between the two in the future my point is that this storyline isnt something that was thrown together haphazardly points about the common people of qarth have no real relevance because this isnt a story about that city but about danys journey why is it so hard to simply assume that qarth is feeling the effects of what has happened and dany not being able to get to xaro because of his guards uh dragons do you think anyone would stand in her way would you not everything needs to be spelled out explicitly and as it pertains to danys growth as a character i feel that the qarth storyline succeeded admirably im not interjecting anything from the books into this assessment im simply using what was presented in the show i have no problems with people disliking the execution of these things but to say that the whole plot was a mess of contradictions and inconsistencies is patently false edited by khalabunga 06 june 2012  0353 pm"

"Reposado",2012-06-06,"ill be blunt perhaps but this is my experience with tv production there was no foreshadowing whatsoever instead it was a smart trick the writers played on you to have you chasing the rabbit much like lost fans did to their disappointment this is why those visions are so vague and seemingly meaningless a fans mind will add anything to salvage it into a coherent story unless you agree that the floor was covered with snow jon snow is the new black for the series the show is a one time product much more than the books are it is much more shortlived and intensive if they have you waiting until the 3rd season it worked no matter how meaningless it is if it is enough to fill the gaping plot holes  it worked toomm im guessing they were more concerned with creating a great visual than with establishing prophecy and i wont disparage their ability at creating visualsi just dont understand why they could show rheagar with aegon dont want to hire an actor fir a speaking role fine have pyclle and varys in the room and say the lines and have extras play rheagar and elia ugh it bugs me so much they didnt drop the prince that was promised or 3 heads of the dragonorrrr have kit harrington with silver hair as rhaegar that would stir the firei keep thinking of the reasons why i never liked that show and never succumbed to my friends suggestions that i should watch it drim glad that you so greatly dislike a show that you never watched"

"tearloch",2012-06-06,"i definitely like the discussion here i think much of the symbolism is important such as snow and burnt thrown room dany finding her love north of the wall etc as far as the significance i guess my theory goes like this much of this series deals with things in 3s 3 treacheries 3 mounts 3 heads 3 3 3 in the hou scene dany is presented with three choices she is presented with achieving her amibitions the iron throne with love drogo and child and with duty the dragons she turns away from ambition and finds love she turns away from love for duty her duty is to protect the realm with her dragons that is why she was able to hatch the dragons when no one else could it is her destiny and she will be tested maybe her being chained up after she finds her dragons symbolizes that she is bound to this destiny and must see it through to be free i also think its important that she finds her love north of the wall while i understand grrm didnt write the screen plays i also think he has some say in shaping them he does write an episode each season so its absurd to think that he isnt in on what happens in the other episodes you cant write an episode of a series in a vacuum he has to know what changes were made in the previous episodes and what is planned for future ones to prevent his writing from being disjointed from the rest of the eipisodes"

"victim",2012-06-10,"wow a lot of hating on robb in this thread i really like the guy if anything the reason why i found the storyline of him and talisa contrived was that it was pretty much his arc in a nutshell what i mean is that heres this guy whos leading thousands of men into constant battles yet all we see of him is when hes with his nurse wife the rooster bolton scenes were great though what we need from robb next season prerw is more battle planning with the boltons umbers tullys karstarks and all the bros for example i really want to see robb ordering bolton to take harrenhal he needs to become a badass again ala the end of the first season for audiences everywhere to be truly mortified when he dies also in terms of the red wedding being solely about the end to cats arc i very much disagree it was the end to the major part of the northern rebellionking in the north arc that started in a game catelyn was an important part of that whole story but it was not entirely her own"
"YTDN",2012-06-10,"i think thats a problem with pacing and the fact they have to fit in all the other characters plots as well since they only had limited time with robb d  d had to make the choice over what was the most important part of robbs arc in the end it seems they decided that the romance had to take priority for reasons of budget and their desire to spend enough time on it for it to seem like a natural romance i imagine next season theyll focus more on the war aspects now that the romance is established and the war is taking a different turn since in clash its basically lots of wins which while awesome for robb would look a bit dull on screen"
"Frey Pie",2012-06-10,"thank youi dont understand why love is such an incomprehensible reason to marry someone and break a vow but a moment of weakness when one is injured and most likely doped up on milk of the poppy is in season 1 when maester aemon gave jon the speech where he says what is honor compared to a womans love what is duty against the feel of new born son in your arms or a brother smile were you rolling your eyes calling bullshit on iti mean yeah fuck the producers for wanting to have a sexual relationship in season two that isnt rape prostitution or manipulativei ask this of the op out of pure curiosity no snark intended but how many people do you know that havent read the books but watch the show have you asked their opinion what is their agegender if i may askas to the inclusion of stoneheart it depends on what martin does with her character as it stands right now at the end of dance im still unsure as to why she was brought back that being said im sure martin has something amazing up his sleeve for her reason and its going to kick my asslastly to the titular topic of this thread does robb need to be redeemed he fucks up and gets killed for it do you view robbs crime as grievous as theons or jaimes that he requires protracted redemptioni know a good few and they dont really care for him mostly lads but a few girls as well one of them wanted to be spoiled so i told her about the rw and she didnt find it in the least shocking would robb have belittled his mother and fathers relationship in the books i dont think sok i think you might pick me up wrong i actually think robb and jeyne loved eachother it was a moment of passion but in the end love won out i have no problem with that and im actually a bit of a romantic so dont think its the love story im against because it couldnt be further from the truth i think the post below yours summed it up for me when robb died it was like a punch in the stomach i just feel hes less likeable in the series then the books and that many others feel this also which will affect the influence of the rw"
"Frey Pie",2012-06-10,"i have to disagree with that i think the character and actions are quite different robb was offstage but we know that he had just heard of his brothers deaths at theons hands we know he was injured and jeyne nursed him we know he felt guilty for what he had done we know he was away from many of his counsellors at the time and we know that he was very young with a rather naive idealisation of honour and chivalry the hbo situation is entirely different hes determined to have his own way regardless of the cost to the war effort it recasts his charactereven more than that hbo have entirely changed the relationship between cat and robb at this point take the scene where a sheepish young robb tricks his mother into buying the crazy things we do for love line and the aftermath where cat sees the damage hes done but reflects that he is terribly young that theres an upside if jeyne is healthy and can give him kids and hopes things can be put right compare that to hbos robb who refuses counsel and marries talisa not only in spite of his mother but partly to spite her my heart breaks for how human book robb is and how hard he tries to do the right thing by everyone hbo robb is a selfish brathymeni agree completelyeven the hymen part tonguepng classbbcemoticon altp   robb wasnt a pov but he was the most important stark for two books i could easily relate to himwho wouldnt wanna be a king and be popular and love by his subjects i wish he didnt marry jeyne because of what happened but i can understand it"
"winterstood",2012-06-10,"i dont think tv show robb was a fool or selfish i think he was still reeling from his mothers betrayal plus news that winterfell had been captured though on the show he hasnt been told that they were killed and that was his weak moment as opposed to the books where his weak moment was news that his mother let jaime lannister escape  physical injury  winterfell being captured and rickon  bran being killedin both he has a weak moment and gives in to physical desire out of a need for solace and then marries the girl to protect her honor in the tv show i think that was the motivating factor for the wedding even though it wasnt as explicitly outlined  he naturally felt that was the right thinig to do after having sex with a woman  to marry her tv show robb is idolized by millions at least hundreds of thousands of girlswomen as evidenced by all the fan tumblr sites out there  because the actor portraying him is very good looking  so that alone will have tv fans rooting for him oh i think for the tv show viewers who havent read the books  the red wedding especially if they do it right devote a whole show to it  make it the finale  with the proper pacing and details  combine the aryahound arc with it and show the full brutality of it  have the beating drums and all the other crucial details will be a shocker on par with the books version and have everybody in arms who didnt already spoil it for themselves by looking it up on the internet edited by winterstood 10 june 2012  1209 pm"
"Areo Speedwagon",2012-06-10,"then youre not watching very diligentlyyoure probably rightthe fact you are using modern standards as your sole criterion on which to judge robb for his misguided medieval honour shows that you have missed the point robb is many good things but he is no social activisti think moral relativism is an empty philosophy but thats a discussion for another forum entirely if thats what you took from my post then its my fault im not judging robbs actions or at least i certainly didnt mean to i meant to say that bookrobb broke his vow for x reason stated above and tvrobb broke his vow for y reason simply for love i wasnt making a moral statement on which is more justifiable or selfish or reprehensible but was trying to say that i can understand tvrobbs motivation a lot more than i can understand bookrobbs for breaking his vowone quick note before moving on it seems to me that tv version at least robb is a bit of a social activist though he is mobilizing a resistance movement against a tyrant he opposes torture i think its safe to say he opposes slavery and he advocates the ethical treatment of enemy prisoners the first and last of those being against the protestations of his advisers all three of those things hes doing i think are quite modern stances on wartime thought i mean in 2012 the use of torture is still vehemently advocated by many in supposed civilized countriesyeah youve missed the point unless you were being purposefully facetious the point is that by justifying idiocy and selfishness with the argument oh heshes just human you simultaneously justify or at least provide a get out clause for thousands of other acts before anyone points out that robbs transgression is minor compared to many others though less so in the show its not jsut the scale of the justification but also the grounds the day that completely unjustifiable and purposefully selfish with no mitigating circumstances actions become semijustifiable if not fully because people are just human a very slippery slope beginsif a justification for atrocity is what you got from that post maybe i did miss your point since you decided to make it almost purely through sarcasm perhaps im allowed a little leeway but i think i see the opportunity for common ground here i hope and yes i was being a little facetious but only in delivery not in content first i think justify isnt the right word i never used it and to be honest i dont think what i posted in any way justifies atrocious behavior but again if thats what you took from it ill accept responsibility im not going to accuse you of not reading my post diligently enough kidding not reallywhat i took from your post was you believe that in my arguing that cersei walder et al are human characters this somehow exonerates them of their crimes or otherwise abdicates them of responsibility for them this couldnt be further from what i believe or intended like i said im not a moral relativist cersei walder et al need to get whats coming to them in the words of many characters from the wire they need to get got the fact that a pedophile rapes children because he was repeatedly raped as child in no way exonerates him of the crime it merely allows us to understand why it happened nothing more when we learn that maggys prophesy is basically the main reason why cersei has always hated tyrion and why she treats him the way she does that information in no way justifies her behavior toward him it merely sheds light on the source of said behaviorand its the same with robb i certainly didnt mean to imply that somehow just because he was deep in the throes of love and consumed with the prize of all too precious you it justifies him breaking his vow on the contrary i do agree with you that tvrobbs action was incredibly selfish but so was bookrobbs as harrad has said several times on this thread regardless of how tvrobb arrived at the destination of breaking his vow he arrived there nonetheless and yes in both cases its selfish but ill reiterate to me breaking his vow because hes deeply in love is simply more understandable not justifiable than breaking a vow for a concept of honor i am 600 years removed fromsympathy and empathy are two subtly but significantly different thingswell said and i agree a friend of mine who hasnt read the books and i were talking after the finale and when robb came up he said hes fucked hes a man after my own heart but hes fucked he and i are able to empathize with robb despite his selfish behavior because of the motivation behind it if you cant thats fine you have every right to think thats not an acceptable motivation but you dont have the right to dictate to me what my personal experience of the show isive missed it until now but the title of this thread is a nice little rhyme as far a the robb stark redemptive arc is concerned i think its cut short obviously he needs to be the cautionary tale he is in feast and dance won every battle but lost everything he also serves to prove tywins comment however much it may hurt that boy kings are the ruination of their house edited by areo speedwagon 10 june 2012  0434

agree about moral relativism to an extent but i wouldnt say thats what this is really id say its more a contextualisation to robb marrying jeyne is what constitutes honour we can debate how honourable it was but in the context of a feudal medieval setting robbs actions are more understandable and personally i think theyre relatively honourable in a modern setting if marriage and virginity were to hold the same significance as they did then robb adheres to the medieval code because it is the only one he knows as such we can pass some modern scorn upon him but it cannot be used as the sole means of doing so im getting too wordy over this but ill try and sum up society and gender relations have improved very slowly over a significant period of time mainly because of the actions of great men women and various movements robb is many good things but he is never going to question or shine a new light upon medieval gender relations short of treating his wife with respectas a side note here while i was considering this it humourously occured to me that in a perverse way littlefinger is one of the most socially progressive people in asoiafone quick note before moving on snipi broadly agree and thats a very fair point admittedly the use of torture and slavery do seem to be viewed dimly within westeros but robb is certainly willing to treat his prisoners with respect though he is

the point the point is youre not meant to understand fully robbs notion of honour because robbs notion of honour isnt the same notion of honour as yours and mine we cant understand it because its not fully understandable to us thats why the characters do shit in the books that we find strange because theyre not us we can find much sympathy in asoiaf and we can see broad strokes of empathy i imagine catelyn is an empathetic character for some modern mothers not being either a parent or a woman i couldnt say for sure but to try and consider major actions as something we can relate to directly is to somewhat miss the point of the novels imoi would also contest this notion that book robb who acts somewhat rashly at a time of extreme sadness and vulnerability and then finds himself in what was clearly a moral dilemma for him see the asos chapter where he brushes between his affection for jeyne and his genuine regret at both losing and offending the freys is comparably selfish with show robb who ignores the war effort in order to spend time with this woman continues actively seeking her out as he becomes more aware of his attraction to her and who then takes a significant time to choose to both nob her and then to seek and dismiss advice to the contraryif i were to offer a modern examplemy team mate and i are playing football soccer during the match he is repeatedly kicked but no decisions are given his way indeed the referee who is meant to be guaranteeing fair play seems to be trying his best to let the other team kick this player the referee is a poor example of theon near the end of the game he loses his temper momentarily and lashes out at the person who fouled him by doing so he gets sent off letting his team downmy team mate and i are playing football soccer he has an early confrontation with a player on the opposing side which is broken up as these players are playing on opposite sides of the pitch this theoretically means that they shouldnt interact any more than is necessary however my team mate decides to seek out the opposing player even when he knows this guy will foul him and try and frustrate him despite our pleas this time mate

robb is many good things but he is never going to question or shine a new light upon medieval gender relations short of treating his wife with respectokay just as i suspected common ground i agree with you on the contextualization thats good term and for the most part i agree with the vast majority of this paragraph i think the only thing we can judge him on regardless of time period is putting his love life regardless of who  how above his troops his cause but since we both have already agreed this is selfish theres no use in belaboring the point as to him never shining a light on medieval gender relations as it stands youre right had he not put himself over his cause and troops and the rw never happened i think tvrobb may have become one of those great men you spoke of that advances a cause tvrobb certainly loves his mother a lot theyve really made a point of how close they are in the show and catelyn is honest headstrong bold and confident many things they have shown talisa to be so far i always took his relationship with talisa to be slightly oedipal in that regard he basically married his mom so who knows between his admiration for his mother and his love of his wife maybe he would have advanced the role of women but well never knowmy beef lay with this notion of your friends that we can somehow absolve robb of criminal negligence as a means of prolonged criticism because hes just humanwe cant and even if we could being just human wouldnt satisfy the requirement thats what the middle two paragraphs of my previous post were aboutyes but thats not the point the point is youre not meant to understand fully robbs notion of honour because robbs notion of honour isnt the same notion of honour as yours and mine we cant understand it because its not fully understandable to us thats why the characters do shit in the books that we find strange because theyre not us we can find much sympathy in asoiaf and we can see broad strokes of empathy i imagine catelyn is an empathetic character for some modern mothers not being either a parent or a woman i couldnt say for sure but to try and consider major actions as something we can relate to directly is to somewhat miss the point of the novels imowhich is precisely why i think the shift to a straight love story was the wiser move in adapting the story to the screen as i said and i take from that paragraph you would agree were 600 years removed from that notion of honor it isnt as you say fully understandable you made my point better than i couldi still take issue with you not thinking were meant to relate i think on some level were meant to relate with every character any author writes finding that humanity is what makes characters worth taking an interest in and its the mark of a great author which martin certainly is but this is a debate for literature as a whole and i dont want to deviate too much i cant relate to robb leading a host to war i cant relate to theon sneaking behind enemy lines and taking a castle but i can relate to wanting to prove yourself to a disapproving father i can relate to being in way over my head granted no ones life was at stake but thats what makes it great for me i know what i felt and i shudder when i imagine the stakes being raised to the level they are in this storyi understand that escapism is the one of the primary functions of fantasy and that not being able to relate to a bastard who willingly joins a militarized penal colony of sorts and ends up turning double agent with the enemy he swore to fight because a greater threat of ice demons of sorts looms imminent is admittedly kind of the point as i said above weve all felt lonely or ignored or slighted or jubilant great writers use that and put it into a context we would otherwise be unable to relate toi would also contest this notion that book robb  with show robb who ignores the war effort in order to spend time with this woman continues actively seeking her out as he becomes more aware of his attraction to her and who then takes a significant time to choose to both nob her and then to seek and dismiss advice to the contraryi suppose thats fair i never really thought of the jeyne situation that way even though for reasons stated that moral dilemma is slightly obfuscated to us as i was reading your synopsis i thought of antony and cleopatra the set up at least wherein that antony ignores his militaristic duties at first for the love of cleopatra who i think is a toosimilartobecoincidentallyaptsurrogate to talisa a foreign highborn beauty but after that i think its stretching to find similarities other than octavian could be roose in that once allies become enemies but thats a very liberal comparison i truly hope they dont turn talisa into cleopatra i think that would betray a lot of what they set up in her character in season 2 but thats way off topic my point is that i dont think robb ignoring his militaristic duties and placing his attention in a woman is that modern of a love story antony and cleopatra was written in about 1606 if we ignore her motivation and focus on the story as a whole samson and delilah is a story about a

"The Meeraculous Third Reed",2012-06-12,"third reeds ability to build a strong concise logical argument without losing temper is an orgasmic treat for the eyesthank you very much i promise as well that this is not a duplicate account tonguepng classbbcemoticon altp snipfair enough i think were as close to agreeing if well ever be im sure robb would have ruled justly but i dont personally think he would have gone about setting dornish like laws of succession and so forthwe cant and even if we could being just human wouldnt satisfy the requirement thats what the middle two paragraphs of my previous post were aboutkk i was simply contesting the notion that people you know do not consider it worthwhile to criticise robb for being a selfish idiot because hes human and that are significantly different scenarios which can result in the same result yet still emote different degrees of sympathywhich is precisely why i think the shift to a straight love story was the wiser move in adapting the story to the screen as i said and i take from that paragraph you would agree were 600 years removed from that notion of honor it isnt as you say fully understandable you made my point better than i couldyeah but one can literally apply this to thousands and thousands of pages of asoiaf different worlds are not fully understandable and therein lies much of the interest if we start to remove ourselves from medieval notions of law and honour shall we next consider it intelligent of the writers to make sansa robbs heir will there be no need for a kingsmoot because everybody just accepts asha should rulethe epistemic distance for lack of a better world between us and asoiaf is what makes of what we read so shocking and vividi still take issue with you not thinking were meant to relate i think on some level were meant to relate with every character any author writes finding that humanity is what makes characters worth taking an interest in and its the mark of a great author which martin certainly is but this is a debate for literature as a whole and i dont want to deviate too much i cant relate to robb leading a host to war i cant relate to theon sneaking behind enemy lines and taking a castle but i can relate to wanting to prove yourself to a disapproving father i can relate to being in way over my head granted no ones life was at stake but thats what makes it great for me i know what i felt and i shudder when i imagine the stakes being raised to the level they are in this storygoes back to the epistemic distance i was talking about i did also note that we can find broad strokes of empathy but for the most part we should not look at the minutiae and say oh wow i can really relate especially when it comes to relationships in asoiaf because we are dealing with a betrothal honour and choice system so diametrically different from oursrobb affected by having the weight of the world on his shoulders we can relate to a degree i doubt any of us have ever held thousands of lives in our handsrobb having to cope with being a 16 year old in a wartorn society leading thousands of men into battle in the name of his recently deceased father whilst his sisters are captives thousands of miles away we cannot relatehence why ive tempered my argument somewhat and have said we can find broad strokes of empathyrobb having an emotional crisis regarding a partner and falling for someone he shouldnt we can relaterobb having to contend with having his bride chosen for him adhering to a medieval code of what constitutes moral behaviour and what doesnt understanding the importance of a womans virginity not just to her but to her house having to play politics within a highly tribal marriage and political system we cant and shouldnt relaterobb is a figure of empathy because hes human and faces dilemmas drastically changing robbs character motives and circumstances in order to create something which instance for instance creates a scenario which is interchangeable between modern and got setting does not create real empathy because its entirely forced imoi suppose thats fair i never really thought of the jeyne situation that way even though for reasons stated that moral dilemma is slightly obfuscated to us as i was reading your synopsis i thought of antony and cleopatra the set up at least wherein that antony ignores his militaristic duties at first for the love of cleopatra who i think is a toosimilartobecoincidentallyaptsurrogate to talisa a foreign highborn beauty but after that i think its stretching to find similarities other than octavian could be roose in that once allies become enemies but thats a very liberal comparison i truly hope they dont turn talisa into cleopatra i think that would betray a lot of what they set up in her character in season 2 but thats way off topic my point is that i dont think robb ignoring his militaristic duties and placing his attention in a woman is that modern of a love story antony and cleopatra was written in about 1606 if we ignore her motivation and focus on the story as a whole samson and delilah is a story about a great soldier who is brought down by the misplaced love and misplaced loyalty he puts in a duplicitous woman as strider said above paris sacrificed troy for helenone huge difference between these women and talisa the vast majority of the accounts we have of them are negative helen caused a ten year war and never comes across sympathetically at least in the iliad cant remember her apperance in the odyssey off the top of my head and many greek tragedies cleopatra is almost exclusively portrayed negatively as some sort of shewitch seductress likewise delilah were not talking about love affairs so much as intoxication for lack of a better word by mysterious immoral women which leaves their targets again for lack of a better word beyond help i think wed agree that this is not what the writers are doing or trying to do with talisa instead we have this awfully contrived cliche of boy meets girl girls sassiness piques interest of boy  etc which could be in place in almost any modern romcomi agree that to turn talisa into a cleopatra like spy figure would be pretty silly they should have just kept her as jeyne edited by the third reed 12 june 2012  0718 pm"
"Areo Speedwagon",2012-06-13," but i dont personally think he would have gone about setting dornish like laws of succession and so forthtrue he certainly would not have gone that far but is there no middle ground between between treating women as utilitarian only useful insofar as their womb is fertile and instituting a fully matriarchal society i intentionally made a false dichotomy out of your point but i think that essence was there maybe he would have included talisa or catelyn in the strategy tent that seemed an old boys club but perhaps thats arya brienne and in her own way and depending on what happens sansas job to change the minds of men that women can have valuable opinions on war i would have included asha in that list but she seems to have already done so to an extentyeah but one can literally apply this to thousands and thousands of pages of asoiaf different worlds are not fully understandable and therein lies much of the interest if we start to remove ourselves from medieval notions of law and honour shall we next consider it intelligent of the writers to make sansa robbs heir will there be no need for a kingsmoot because everybody just accepts asha should rulesansa being made to robbs heir would be unintelligible given the story but i would say for different reasons as weve established over the course of this dialogue we already are removed from medieval notions of law and honour so our further removal should have no bearing on the story itself youre right in saying those scenarios would be unintelligible but i believe the source of why that would ring so terribly false is because having those events come to pass would remove the characters themselves from the medieval notions of law and honour not the reader i think our involvement is very much secondary to the characters as theyre the ones living the storythe epistemic distance for lack of a better world between us and asoiaf is what makes of what we read so shocking and vividgoes back to the epistemic distance i was talking about i did also note that we can find broad strokes of empathy but for the most part we should not look at the minutiae and say oh wow i can really relate especially when it comes to relationships in asoiaf because we are dealing with a betrothal honour and choice system so diametrically different from oursyou come up with really great terms and epistemic distance is fantastic im definitely going to have to absorb that into my lexicon to be honest though if anyone asks ill probably leave out how i read it debating someone on a forum dedicated to a series of fantasy novelsto your point though i will agree if im allowed a slight word replacement which youre more than welcome to say isnt appropriate what youre calling minutiae im more comfortable calling context i think in the sentence you wrote the replacement works linguistically and syntactically and viewed through this lens i think i finally understand what you meant in your original response that kicked off this whole exchange if you were saying that were not meant to relate to the minutiae context of this or any fantasy story i 100 agree though i do find myself salivating at his descriptions of feasts he certainly has a knack for writing about foodi compartmentalize things and thats what i guess ive done for minutiaecontext and emotional content so im now ready to say youre right oh it hurts with your original post as long as i can have this caveat i still strongly believe that we are supposed to relate to every character on an emotional level every character we wish to succeed anyway relatingempathizing with cersei ramsay walder is impossible but its supposed to be we dont want good things to happen to them at least i dont on the contrary we actively root for them die horrible deaths thats the power of being able to relate to a character on an emotional level it casts the die so to speak we cannot relate to what happens to characters in asoiaf and i can understand now what you meant by saying were not supposed to but i think we can and are supposed to relate to how they deal with what happens to them how they work it outi think it goes to what joseph campbell found in the hero with a thousand faces that regardless of where the myth came from who tells it or what happens different cultures thousands of miles apart completely unaware of each others existence came up with remarkably similar tales the archetypes are all the same the hero the mentor woman as mother woman as temptress the trickster the herald the threshold guardians the shapeshifter etc these archetypes are in our bones in our dna they go deeper than our psyche weve hopefully all had a mentor yes but none of us have had that mentor be a magical assassin who gives us a coin so we can cross an ocean and become a magical assassin too arya as hero jaqen as both mentor and shapeshifter martin is simply continuing a tradition that goes back to grimms fairy tales beowulf the iliad the epic of gilgamesh these stories have endured and i believe martins will endure because these characters the big ones follow archetypes so ingrained in us we dream them because we share the same dna the same origins we respond in kind to similar things the origin of the hero tale itself is a fantastic exaggeration of the hunter who brings back food for the tribe allowing them to survive to say were not meant to relate to that i believe is to say were not meant to relate to our origins as human beingsand joseph campbell also found that ancient myths were more than just stories to be told they were actually metaphorical maps of the territory one had to travel to become a human being the concept of paying the iron price really hit me as ridiculous as sounds it is now one of the principle i live my life by i dont use it in regards to what jewelry i can wear i dont even wear a watch but on how i act if i want a night of intoxication i have to earn it i have to pay the iron price for it if i want to eat meat i pay the iron price for it sometimes i do take the literal meaning there it has taught me in a more visceral way than i had previously thought or known that all things have intrinsic value and that value needs to be honored before you can consume itone huge difference between these women and talisa the vast majority of the accounts we have of them are negativegah i was going back and forth about citing those examples because i knew you were going to bring that up so in a sense well done you certainly didnt disappointboy meets girl girls sassiness piques interest of boy i certainly cant argue that isnt what happened because youre right it pretty much is i guess i just saw her sassiness as a projection of his mother in that case his attraction to her made a lot of sense to me maybe thats rationalization or i invented that so as to not see the contrived nature of the relationship regardless thats how i choose to view his attraction and my interpretation allows me to enjoy those scenes instead of get annoyed by them so im going to count it as a wini have really enjoyed this back and forth ive found myself at work clicking the refresh button when i get a spare moment and you honestly helped me to understand why people think that storyline is shit and changed my mind of those that think so its clear youre an

"victim",2012-06-13,"would she be aware of twists from next season are the scripts even written yetfrom what i gather some of the actors are told the basic outline of their story and the part they will play in the series after they get the role in order for oona to play the role to the best of her ability she should be aware of any future twists about her character specifically especially if they are large ones hypothetically if there is a twist and talisa turns out to be jeyne or anyone other than who she says she is for that matter it would be extremely detrimental for the actress to not know this well in advance as she may play the character the completely wrong wayedit the scripts themselves are not essential dd can provide her with some kind of outline because im sure they know where theyre going with each character edited by victim 13 june 2012  0138 am"
"Currawong",2012-06-13,"i dont understand why love is such an incomprehensible reason to marry someone and break a vow but a moment of weakness when one is injured and most likely doped up on milk of the poppy is in season 1 when maester aemon gave jon the speech where he says what is honor compared to a womans love what is duty against the feel of new born son in your arms or a brother smile were you rolling your eyes calling bullshit on iti mean yeah fuck the producers for wanting to have a sexual relationship in season two that isnt rape prostitution or manipulativeexactlywhether robb had sex and then married another woman out of grief etc as in the book or out of love as in the tv show really doesnt matter in the slightest  the guts of the issue is that he broke his oath to the freys pure and simple and the rw shows that why you broke your oath is quite unimportant  it is the fact of breaking your oath that counts in the eyes of most people especially someone like walder frey who already has a chip on his shoulder just ask jaime lannister about having a good reason for breaking an oath  nonbook readers will still be completely shocked and appalled by the rw because i dont think they anticipate such a brutal consequence for oathbreaking and even if they thought that there would be some sort of revenge against robb himself like ned stark i doubt that anyone just watching the tv series could anticipate that the freys intend to take out catelyn and half the starks faihful as welli dont believe there is any necessity to redeem robb he is a hormonal young man in love  lust for the first time and is trying to grow up and be a king in the most difficult of circumstances he is at the age where he does not want to listen to sensible parental advice from cat sound familiar to parents of teenagers especially where that parent has herself done something stupid and he is therefore determined to live or die by his own mistakes alas in this case he will die theres nothing to redeem other than a very sad case of youthful stupidity from an otherwise fine young man edited by currawong 13 june 2012  0404 am"

"Horus Ex Machina",2012-06-08,"i was always under the impression that the dothraki and their culture were an important part of danys character so they shouldnt just all be replaced or replacable actually the mysterious growth of danys khalasar in the last episode goes against this phasing out of the dothraki but as far as the language is concerned dany might teach her remaining dothraki to speak the common tongue so there would be no need for too much dothraki on the showi concede however that it would be confusing for viewers which language is which if actually both dothraki and high valyrian featured on the showmy theory wouldnt require the phasing out of all dothraki characters just characters like irri that daenarys would have to speak to on a regular basis so instead of irri you have missandei doreah of course doesnt play into this at all but she should have been dead a long time ago she merely gave the entire new storyline an extra antagoniststrong belwas now how would that work exactlywell shed still joust the hero of mereen only in a different wayjust wanted to say i enjoy kovarros character personally since the garden partywell it seemed that losing rakharo was not in their plans so perhaps maybe kovarro is going to stand in for this role as her chief bloodrider which only makes the killing of irri seem even more pointless and jhiqui just seemed to disappear entirely after the first season though she never did much even then it would have made more sense to kill her off since she never really did much but echo irri even in the books irri had a much closer literally relationship with dany even though i know that we werent likely to see any of that in the show she was still one of danys closest companions it just doesnt make sense to lose both of the handmaidens who chime in with their dothraki opinions on her actions from time to time edited by horus bergeron 08 june 2012  1240 pm"

"Jameson Snow",2012-06-04,"well i think at least when it comes to dagmer and the crews motivation i dont think there is any confusion as to why they did what they did they were fine allowing theon to lead them and go raise some hell in winterfell because that fit in with the ironborn philosophy of reaving and taking what what they wanted when they wanted but when push came to shove they had no real loyalty to theon as a leader and when offered the option of giving him up in order to save their own lives and return home it was an easy choicethere were issues with the end of theons storyline but that imo was not one of them i agree it fits in with their philosophy but not in terms of the location of winterfell when asha gets there she reminds theon that the source of the ironborns strength is in their ships which is why they need to stick to raiding towns villages etc near water why would ironborn sailorssoldiers ignore this idea and agree to go to where they would be weak surely they would speak up in protest against theon i guess i just am confused by the character of dagmer and his motivation why would he be the one to be somewhat kind and encouraging to theon helping him while all the other ironborn despise him and then just turn on him at the end i get that he has no problem giving him up when his life is on the line but it just seems like a big waste of time coming to winterfell what did he hope to accomplish"

"Reposado",2012-06-06,"ps xaro was resting easy because he thought all his enemies were dead or captured they didnt just steal her dragons and kidnap her at the same time because they didnt know they would need to they didnt think they needed her at all until pyat realized the dragons would be stronger if she was imprisoned with themi dont care how many enemies are believed to be kicking around noone is storming the red keep with ten men silentlyhe just killed eleven powerful men no one was going to step up in those organizations and take control everyone just meekly agrees that xaro is king now there is no king of qarth just killing a few traders and proclaiming it doesnt mean anyone is going to listen especially when you have no armspower resides when men believe it does when xaro starts going on about being king in the streets of qarth the common reaction would be to roll your eyes ok buddy im the high septon"

"Horus Ex Machina",2012-06-07,"danys whole arc this season has been awfulher book arc wasnt action packed but at least we had character development as she dealt with the realities of politics and there was a lot of foreshadowing in the house of the undyingin the show we got plot points that went nowhere false tension and endless <U+0080><U+009C>blood dragon rahhh<U+0080><U+009D>people praise the show because its so <U+0080><U+009C>realistic<U+0080><U+009D> to steal her dragons xxd had taken control of the city he could have captured dany and had her escorted to the house of the undying by 100 watchmen so his ally pyat pree could imprison her instead he couldnt even be bothered to spare a single watchman to protect him or his house and dany and her tiny khalasar were able to march in there take him prisoner and lock him in his own vault pretty poor security for the guy whos just crowned himself in a coupi dont criticize hbo for alot but this storyline was just horrible and to think they killed off irri to get us on this track what a waste of a season they may as well have saved their money and told emilia clarke to take the season off they really made her look bad this season by having her go off on one note for the last half of the season alot of fans have been dumping on her this season but most critics adored her performance in season 1 the difference was the material to me not the actress"
"Dolorous Nick",2012-06-08,"i think i might be in the minority here but i actually enjoyed danys story arc in the tv series far more than in the books she is betrayed by doreah learns about the harsh realities of politics in being used as a pawn in the xaropyat coup grieves for her dead khalasar members and discovers that she can command her dragons to burn her enemies on command i will admit that i found it a little strange how easily xaro was captured in the end one would think somebody as cunning as him would have his own kingsguard of sorts they laid the fire and blood stuff on a little thickthat line is effective once or twice but starts to grate on you when its overused you know nothing jon snowcomes to mind from the novels"

"Khal-a-bunga",2012-06-08,"i took my post from another thread to copy here as it feels semirelevant to the discussioni must not have had the same problem with the qarth storyline as many here did because i found it to be much more satisfying than her stay there in the novels in the red waste the audience sees that dany isnt suddenly going from powerless to allpowerful simply by the virtue of having dragons at her disposal her people are dying and suffering she loses silver and she has only jorah to truly rely on and carry her throughwhen she comes to the gates of qarth and meets with the thirteen she is denied entry because shes unwilling to use her dragons her children as dany sees it as a bargaining chip xaro then invokes sumai to grant her and her dothraki followers access into the city despite the fact that the other members of the thirteen dont feel the same next we see her with irri who firmly establishes that dany is a khaleesi and not a princess and doreah in her chambers the foreshadowing of dracarys also happens in this scene as well as the setup for doreahs betrayal he loves you men like to talk about other men when theyre happyat the party thrown in danys honor pyat pree mentions that dany should come to the house of the undying jorah then meets quaithe who warns him of the dangers that dany faces in the city as a result of her being the mother of dragons and xaro begins to sow seeds of discontent between dany and jorah after discounting pyat pree as a shamthis is also where the vault is introduced and xaros insistence that power resides where men believe it resides begins xaro somewhat like dany came to this city with nothing and has established himself through sheer force of will at the gates of qarth and during her meeting with the spice king dany vows to take what is rightfully her own through virtue of her family history and her dragons she says these things with conviction but also with no true understanding of what it means to wield such powerjust as the spice king and the rest of the thirteen doubted pyat pree and xaro due to his upbringing xaro and pree doubt dany the difference being unlike xaros empty vault dany does have a true power hidden inside of her that pree monologues about her dragons strengthening his power then tells her that her own power makes the dragons ergo the source of his and the other warlocks powers stronger is ultimately his own undoing which seems less anticlimactic to me and more intentionally ironicwhen all is said and done dany shows her true strength by ignoring the false visions of power shown to her in the house of the undying the throne representing her future and drogo representing what was and embracing her role as a mother of dragons her remaining dothraki loot xaros own baubles and trinkets mirroring the scene where she forbid kavarro from doing so to purchase a small ship and go on to the next leg of their journeydoreah and xaro are locked in his empty vault and the lesson that dany learns isnt dont trust rich people that want to marry you but rather that real power can and does exist inside of her if she can believe in herself and those around her whom she truststhere are plenty of other things that tie this all together and i barely touched upon how danys relationship with jorah is challenged which will give further weight to the relationship between the two in the future my point is that this storyline isnt something that was thrown together haphazardly points about the common people of qarth have no real relevance because this isnt a story about that city but about danys journey why is it so hard to simply assume that qarth is feeling the effects of what has happened and dany not being able to get to xaro because of his guards uh dragons do you think anyone would stand in her way would younot everything needs to be spelled out explicitly and as it pertains to danys growth as a character i feel that the qarth storyline succeeded admirably im not interjecting anything from the books into this assessment im simply using what was presented in the show i have no problems with people disliking the execution of these things but to say that the whole plot was a mess of contradictions and inconsistencies is patently false"

"SerMixalot",2012-06-07,"in the books he held the honour of one noble girl in higher regard than the outcome of the entire war and the fates of thousands of his own men is that really much more admirable than what he did in the showyes because he believes like his father that one must act honorably is all cases this is a strict moral code which apparently not many people understand in this day and age which is somewhat disturbing in its own right it is the conflict that arises from this strict moral code that causes irreconcilable conflcts throughouth asoiaf it is about doing the right thing banging a noble woman and leaving her is simply not the right thing to do that happened from a moment of physical weakness injury and massive grief the loss of an unselfish lovehis brothers that is the point not that this or that is understandable or loveis more important than the honor of a small house it is about doing the right thingpursuing talisa was a selfish act he pursued her for his own selfish reasonslove that pointed is screamed to the viewer in episode 8"

"Maia",2012-06-07,"until he makes his tragic mistake of sleeping with jeyne he acts perfectly wins every battle wins every diplomatic maneuverhuh it is made very clear in the books that robb didnt understand diplomacy and politics at all and that it massively contributed to his doom his one diplomatic overture was disastrous and not only because of the people involved but also because he took a completely wrong tone robb didnt understand that alliances are matters of quid pro quo even when both sides share a common goal he didnt see how kingdom of the north that includes poorly defensible riverlands was an epically bad idea no matter who sat on the iron throne he thought that he could achieve complete victory by military means alone etcshe does this all without any consideration for the consequencesi do wish that grrm had spelled it out in her pov but do remember that at that point cat thought that there was a massive lannister conspiracy that tyrion was a part of that had already resulted in the deaths of one hand and 2 attempts on bran she was wrong as it happens but she did have as much circumstantial evidence for this view as ned had for the bastardy of the royal children so from her pov as soon as tyrion recognized her the game was up and it was all about who stole the first march on whomshe has him swear by the sword but hey this is a member of the kinsguard who put his sword in aerys backshe doesnt rely on jaimes word though but tyrions tyrion made the official offer of exchange in open court in his role as the acting hand by questioning jaime and comparing it with what tyrion told her earlier cat had finally found out that tyrion had nothing to do with the attempts on bran that he had been telling her the truth the whole time and thus may be somewhat trustworthylannisters may be dodgy but they do observe the westerosi norms about exchanges and such as we later see those exchanges dont happen with any particular precautions either just with small delegations coming under the flag of truce and doing it which is why it was so damaging of edmure to proclaim far and wide that it was not an exchange that jaime had escapedfurther cat understood cerseis character and knew what sacks entail well enough to forsee that the girls were unlikely to survive kls fall to stannisand if stannis had won jaime would have become fairly worthless as a hostage anyway whereas the girls were now robbs only heirs and situation of a ruler without heirs is very precariousthe funny thing is that if jaime hadnt been massively delayed by the bloody mummers and made it to kl before the battle of the blackwater the starks would have actually gotten sansa back we know this because we see povs of both tyrion and jaime so cat wasnt even wrong to believe that they might honor the exchange of course they didnt have arya but even having sansa alone would have been helpful at that pointagain the whole mess happened because robb really was bad at politics he went off out of reach of communications for months without leaving anybody with the authority to handle the potentially volatile political situation for him in his absence and before that he basically ignored all and any pleas for political decisions that roderick and luwin didnt have the authority to make on their own as a result of which the north fell into disorder and internecine warfarebook robb was a precocious brilliant warlord but he failed at everything else that being a ruler entails that was his tragedy"

"Sel(l)mysword",2012-06-05,"i totally agree aryas character in the books is superbly constructed on the basis of the relentless adversity grrm throws her against personally im looking at the next two season as the shows potential redeeming seasons for this past one shes a badass but if the writers of the show keep halfassing the terrible crap she has to go thru shell just look like an idiot when she goes to braavos"

"Tenlaar",2012-06-05,"i feel like they have removed almost all of the terrible utterly depraved cruelty and the constant mindnumbing terror that she experienced and that ultimately led her to decide never again and that is such a let down"
"Slurktan",2012-06-06,"i quite like the changes they made to the arya character and most importantly her plotline they cut away most of the dross and made up some good stuff with tywin then again imo arya is easily the most needless character in both acok and asos so really any changes were helpful"
"The Scabbard Of the Morning",2012-06-06,"completely gutted her character she is an entirely changed person after harrenhal but in the show shes essentially the same as before no character development at all"
"sennahoj",2012-06-06,"arya is one of my favourite povs in the books and i liked her on the show a lot as well but how can you say there was no character development just because she didnt kill that guard herself arya killed a boy her own age in season 1 and ordered the deaths of several men in harrenhal how much more ruthless can a teenage girl get much more important after losing everything at the end of season 1 arya learns to trust people again yoren gendry jaqen which i dont think is a small development after that experience arya has seen another father figure killed friends tortured for a time she came to respect and like even the man who should be one of her worst enemies despite some smartass remarks to tywin on the whole arya kept her head down low and played the mouse in harrenhal and even though the arc with jaqen played out differently she tricked him into helping her escape by naming him and received the coin at the end how that accounts for no development is beyond me"
"The Scabbard Of the Morning",2012-06-06,"no development because shes still the same person as she was at the end of season 1 theyre is no sign that shes been hardened by her experience ordering someone else to kill is not the same as doing the deed oneself that precisely why the starks require the man who passes the sentence must swing the sword because they understood that its not the same arya character in the book by the end was a very angry very bitter very determined and very vengeful where do you see that in the tv show weasel soup and the killing of the guard was all about her taking control of her destiny and gaining agency instead she gets jaquen to do everything for her on the tv show she doesnt lift a finger to do any of it"
"Salome Sand Witch",2012-06-06,"im in agreement i think the loss of the weasel soup was a key moment lost to the development of aryas character she not only demands the death of many men but is complicit in making it happen with no remorse thats pretty huge if you ask me"
"SerMixalot",2012-06-06,"as important and disturbing as arya killing is her state of living is equally important to her development in the books she goes from hiding her identity and gender while walking to the wall wandering the woods becomes a sheep and a mouse arry weasel etc the point is that she is learning through hard experience to move silently to hide to take on other identities the intensity of those actions are critical to her development into a fm"
"Ser Dermett Corbray",2012-06-06,"they kind of dropped the ball on her stay at harrenhal the almost dickensian levels of abuse she was getting in the books didnt translater to screen it kinda showed just how tough a girl arya was going from the priveleged life of a lords daughter to being kicked awake each morning by weese etc and she takes it all on the chin up until jaqen gives her the power to get some revenge show arya is tywins fecking cupbearer hardly a tough life sure she gets a bit of abuse from the lannister men but thats hardly scarring maybe it will be the aftermath of rw when we see her harden up considerably i reckon if rw happens in episode 9 they will have the fight against lannister men in the inn in the books probably located elsewhere in the show alongside the hound into episode 10 her season ending with her leaving the hound to die from wounds fighting the lannisters but this is just guesswork cant see them including all the hound and aryas travels down the rivers and into the vale in the show"
"Autopath",2012-06-06,"the only moment you need to know that her character has already been permanently changed is when she relays all the glorious legends of the young wolf tales any normal child would buy into and believe and then she looks at tywin with that deadness in her eyes and says anyone can be killed"
"The Nerdly Knight",2012-06-06,"i really enjoy her character in the books one of my top five and shes good in the show too but her potential isnt being met like a few others have said harrenhall just really dropped down everything for her in the show yes the tywin lannister thing was a neat substory but i would have rather seen the books story here especially her kill escaping the castle she didnt need jaqen to finally leave the castle instead he helped put everything in place and she took the first step in her transformation i really look forward to seeing how things shape up for her in season 3 though the actress playing her is superb and really captures arya they just need to utilize her awesome story from the book"
"The Monkey",2012-06-06,"i agree to a degree but i have to say that the aryatywin pairing made for damn good television they could have remedied the lack of suffering by having an episode of aryas life as the mountains cupbearer which as we all know wouldnt have been pleasant and and think one coldblooded murder was vital to end her storyline this season as it would leave viewers questioning where her character is headed shame edited by the monkey 06 june 2012  0713 am"
"Bearsblood8",2012-06-06,"i agree that arya killing the soldier to exit harrenhal is a pivotal moment the only take the bull by the horns moments we have from arya at harrenhal in the show are 1 arya trying to steal battle plans from one of the most dangerous men in westeros and 2 arya threatening  outsmarting a skilled assassin both of these are pretty bold moves but neither is vicious i think its a willingness to be absolutely vicious that begins to define arya"
"Spearmother",2012-06-06,"considering the speed with which the other story lines were developing apart from danys maybe i could have gone without three episodes of arya being lord tywins cup bearer although i have to admit the scenes between them were excellent i still would have liked to see her with roose bolton aah all the changes are making me dizzy   shockedgif classbbcemoticon altshocked "
"sarah.jenice",2012-06-06,"i really enjoyed arya this season and her scenes with tywin but i do think they are missing her character ark im worried that they are afraid to make a young girl as violent as arya becomes and that would be terrible even in season 1 when she kills the boy in kings landing she just stands up and more accidentally stabs him than making a conscious decision to stick him with the pointy end and if i am not mistaken killing the guard at harrenhal isnt her only personal kill in the book doesnt she fight before they escape the holdfast where yorren is killed i am not certain if she kills anyone but i remember her fighting and stabbing at men climbing up the ladders to breech the holdfast they still have plenty of time to turn things around but i think they have to have her kill at the inn with the hound or it will be really unbelievable that shes training to become a fm when shes only killed on boy in kings landing"
"SerMilady",2012-06-06,"i was so disappointed that they skipped arya killing the guard that out of all the scenes to look forward to in season 2 was the one i could visualize the best rain falling arya slicing the guards throat whispering valar morghulis with that deadblank stare maisie does so well if were talking things that translate well to television that was one of them shame"
"nearthewoods",2012-06-06,"as much as i stick up for the series i agree that aryas character has been a little shortsided no pun intended with hbo in order to survive in this most ruthless world arya had to essentially numb herselfand this sociopath tint to her development is what allowed her to become the very dark person she turned so willingly into killing the guard was definitely the point of no returnas we see in the hbo series she accidentally killed that stable boy and ordering deaths is not exactly the same as undertaking it yourself in my opinion i wish the show had shown her killing somebody with intent while i look forward to her scenes with the hound it was not just some innocent joyride through the flooded countryside i feel like the hound teaching her how to stab someone cleanly through the heart et cetera and her time spent with this coldblooded killer in his own right is what finally solidified what she was to become a lot of that will loose its meaning if tvarya does not initiate this change herself firstso heres hoping we see something like that next season"
"Harrad",2012-06-06,"no harm no foul arya is still the same killing the stable boy is a clear killing for reason to all series viewers ordering the deaths of others are more contemplating killing tywin is another wanting to go with jaquen is still more i dont find her as dark as many say even in the books was ned stark dark because he killed countless foes arya is just doing it in the only way that a 75 lb weakling can in a medieval world"
"GoodGuyA",2012-06-06,"theyve delayed her arc it makes sense given that nothing of that arc is even displayed until after book 3s pivotal moment i have a feeling that the entirety of her season 4 character will be frustrated to the core and only the next step in her life will be able to calm her down the character has not been butchered as some claim merely not developed in the same way this season the thing about development is that we cannot assume that it happened when we dont see it unless you really want some invented action scenes in aryas storyline theres no way to demonstrate her supposed descent until much later"
"Mikey",2012-06-06,"i think that aryas character in series 1 was great stuck to the books and some great character development went on there then series 2 rolled around and shes serving tywin as the maid but thats not what happens in the books until much later if i recall she tells jaqen the wrong names in the show to in the books it irked me somewhat that theyve changed her characters story arc around a little in the show vs the books"
"sennahoj",2012-06-06,"i agree with goodguya about delaying her arc for the show it makes sense to space out her development more over the seasons at least 3 and 4 for everything in asos in the books i was so disappointed how few chapters arya had after asos in my opinion it would make her character a bit frustrating to watch in the future if she made the transition to coldblooded killer too quickly and then being stuck in a place daenerysstyle and not having much to do anymore until her time has come in grrms scheme of things to return and kick ass"

"BabyMeraxes",2012-06-05,"now that the season is wrapped lets rate the performances top 5 ladies top 5 dudes and top 5 minors 1 alfie alans theon he really killed it this season and the beheading of ser rodrick really sealed the deal that was almost the most moving scene of the series 2 jack gleesons joffrey spot on i think it takes a lot to create and portray a truly irredeemable character on top of the fact that hes just a kid 3 charles dances tywin almost the exact opposite of joff dance gave me a whole new perspective on tywins character and made a potential onenote character a character i never cared to read about one of the highlights of the season 4 conleth hills varys destroyed every scene he was in pitch perfect varys his coy salty faces gave dinklage a run for his money 5 liam cunninghams davos the best of the new male characters introduced this season i wish he had more scenes 1 michelle fairleys catelyn she murdered catelyn my favorite scene and the best acted of the season was when lf delivers neds bones gutwrenching stuff and shell sweep awards season if theres any justice left in this world 2 gwendoline christies brienne i was really nervous about the casting of this character but christie surpassed all my expectations shes totally overshadowed ncws jamie in the few scenes they shared this season and her reaction to renlys death was moving when it could have been super clunky and rushed 3 lena headeys cersei i was not on the lena headey ship until blackwater martin gave her some wonderful stuff to work with and she really steppedup to the challenge 4 sophie turners sansa she barely edges out over williams arya but sansa had the harder scenes the riot in kings landing joffs throne room assult and sophie sold sansa better than actress twice her age 5 maisie williams arya how old is she again 13 shes got a great career ahead of her 1 pyat pree ignoring the dragons he saved qarth 2 ygritte cant wait to see more of her im glad she ditched secretary school 3 shae if they continue with her story line as it plays out in the books everyone is going to freak out 4 yorin i was sad to see him go more so than when he died in the books 5 irri for that guttural sobbing in episode two alone"
"gogorath",2012-06-05,"top 4 for me men 1 allen 2 dinklage its obvious and he gets the best lines but still the range was fantastic and he kept some potentially cheesy moments real the speech time with shae 3 dillane he got so little time but i think he took a very hard character and really nailed him stannis is petty pedantic righteous bitter and at the same time courageous and driven dillane got that across so well with so little time to do it 4 costerwaldau of all the actors i think his jaime might be the one id see most while reading just seems perfect and the too many vows speech was nailed women 1 cersei headey killed the whole season bitter drunk triumphant impatient bored lashing out determined caring mother and a willing if odd mentor 2 fairley 34 williamsturner i cant really pick the anyone can be killedshrug versus dinner with the lannisterslashing out at shea good stuff all around minor characters 1 malahide balon greyjoy had a tiny bit of time but thats basically him in a nutshell they didnt even need to introduce him 2 maester luwin dont know the actors name just great stuff a lot of emotion in his voice without overacting 3 dotrice wildly amusing perhaps this is too minor but i really enjoyed his character"

"Les Berceaux",2012-06-05,"ladiesemilia clarke did an admirable job with her material this year it wasnt perfect stuff but the early scenes in the red waste and the always humorous spice king scenes set up some great payoff in valar morghulis in many ways daenerys story reflected what the second seasons of television series are usually about characters questioning their purpose and assessing whether they are really strong enough and committed enough to get what they wantlena heady has been a favorite of mine since the pilot unlike many fans who first came from the books her performance and interpretation of cersei has certainly evolved for the better and her moments in blackwater were an exciting culmination of that evolutionrose leslie will undoubtably be a rising fan favorite in season 3 my only complaint is that she didnt get to tell the bael the bard story if she had she would have been the breakout character of season 2 instead ofgwendoline christie has done what many of her castmates before here did erase any doubt in my mind that another actor could fill their role i loved her but dont really have anything else to say aside from my high anticipation for her performance in season 3natalie dormer was everything i wanted and more from margaery tyrell my excitement for her casting was dulled by the fact that the character doesnt flourish for a while in the novels but i think we can all agree that her performance in the first half of season 2 certainly allowed the tyrell rose to flourish more than it did in a clash of kingsgentlemenisaac hempstedwright broke my heart as bran this year the character gets largely set aside for parts of the season as well as parts of a clash of kings but still he sticks out in my mind particular his unspoken scene at the end of the prince of winterfell thats a testament to the young mans performance and im looking forward to seeing what he does with bran in the futurealfie allen being a fan of his sister lily allen i spent the first season singing her song alfie in my head whenever he was onscreen this year however i was floored time and time again by his ability to communicate the unwritten some of the most classic parts of his narration from a clash of kings such as his envisioning himself rising in the ranks of the nights watch and his decision to turn his cloak and the inner conflicts involved were told without a line of dialogue thanks to alfies grand performance for those of you who havent heard the song click here to enjoy lily allens song alfie which is obviously about our own theon greyjoycharles dance was a revelation this season i love love loved his scenes with jaime and especially tyrion last year and im very excited for his final tenure as hand of the king but his scenes with maisie williams will probably stick out to me as one of the best creations of the shows creative staffliam cunningham i dont have much to say for his performance aside from how much it grew on me as the season progressed even though id read the books i found that as more of his backstory was told i became more invested with him ive always been a little skittish about davos the first time i read a clash of kings i hated him but i consider his three chapters in a dance with dragons to be one of the highlights of the book especially the one and perhaps only time well see the three sisters which has become one of my favorite chapters of the seriesnicolas costerwaldau delivered the standout performance of episode seven which in my opinion sealed the deal for his strong claim to award nominations this yearminorben crompton nailed the dour and understated humor of dolorous edddonald sumpter ill admit that mr sumpter would have had to do the absolute worst job of any actor on a television series ever for me to not be happy with maester luwin his goodbye to bran and rickon is a staple for the series and he seems to be one of the few actors unanimously liked by newbies and experts alike im proud to say im one of those peoplejoe dempsie could just stand in the background of every scene with his shirt off and id love him im a big fan of his and hannah murrays performance on skins and i greatly enjoyed his undeniable chemistry with maisie williamsfinn jones to me qualifies for this category and his reaction to renlys death was very well done i certainly hope his scene with sansa from the beginning of a storm of swords is intact next yearcarice van houten was suitably deadpan when appropriate as well as creepy fascinating a little sexy and obviously kissed by fire im a little burned out from earlier paragraphs so im going to end my post here except to say that if she has her hair done up in buns one more time tantrumgif classbbcemoticon alttantrum  edited by les berceaux 05 june 2012  0529 pm"

"sarah.jenice",2012-06-05,"youve brought up an interesting point and while the tv series is not cannon for the books i dont think it is impossible that jaquen knew about aryas list when he knew other secret stuff like her true name jaquen had to have seen something in arya that made him believe that she was fm material or he wouldnt have given her the coin and encouraged her to go to braavos i think the show did a great job of showing his interest in her starting with the way he looked at her when she hit rorge with her stick sword a boy has more courage than sense and the great scenes they had together in my humble opinion i still dont think we have enough information on the fm to fully make conclusions about all of their methods and motives if arya had gone with jaquen he would have taken her to the house of black and white so he must not be a renegade or he wouldnt be reporting back to them and yes arya did save him rorge and biter from the fire so he said they needed to give three deaths to the red god but how does a fm make that decision no one paid the price for deaths so if a fm is in mortal peril he can be saved but then gets to kill someone else to take his place once we learned about how the fm are hired ive always found what jaquen did with arya confusing maybe there are loose guidelines to what you can do with your assassin powers when you are out on a mission when it comes to your life i dont think arya will truly become no one because of her nymeria connection but i am not sure how she will get out of there it seems like such a secretive organization wouldnt just let people who change their minds leave but perhaps arya will be assigned to westeros and once there she can change her course without them immediately being after her hopefully we will learn more with her training and will have a better understanding of how they operate for the show ive been wondering if they will let jaquen train her instead of the kindly man since the actor was such a big hit it wouldnt go with the books especially if he really is the fm in oldtown but theyve made worse changes"
"A Stark in Salem",2012-06-05,"sarahjenice at this point the motives and methods for the fm are indeed pretty obscure though i believe rrm has some sort of logic in mind so many characters and organizations in the series have these incredibly longterm agendas its often impossible to figure out what they are by what is presented or said for instance at first varys seemed to be for what would seem to be mostly himself or some vague notion of the good of realm but then underlying it all it seems hes part of a secret group trying to get the targaryens back in power but how do you hold true to a 20 year plan anyway or maybe its even something elsethe fm are so much older and more steeped in mystery that it would be very hard to say exactly how or why they do things their rules are pretty vague too at least from the outside clearly there is something happening in oldtown with one of them that took pates life and that was not a standard give the gift of death situation it was unlikely anyone even paid enough attention to pate to care to askpay to get him killed no that was planned by the fm to assume his identity and get in with the rogue maester they guy was waiting for sam too rightand lets not forget arya is a novice masters or all kinds rarely tell an initiate all of the truth personally i believe she will stay and see it through i love her arc more than almost any other in the series she will have some important role to play out before the end i am sure"

"A Stark in Salem",2012-06-03,"i didnt hate the episode overall but my expectations hit rock bottom a few weeks ago so from that low anything even halfway decent has been ok for me i have had to sort of take the approach of deciding im seeing a summary version of the books with some poorly contrived and useless sections mixed in with some spot on scenes to make it worth staying with yeah the others scene started out strong especially at a distance but once you just see them shuffling along it got a little silly except the rotting horse that was great and very like the book and seriously why have sam sitting there and the leader wight sees him what a fat crying coward is not worth chowing down on dont think so though one more line about gilly and i would have been glad to see him chomped or skewered"

"A Song of Hound and Wolves",2012-06-04,"of all the atrocious decisions taken in the adaptation of the second season  having joffrey and not cersei be the one to order the killing of the bastards having robb fall for a spunky and socially progressive chick from volantis cutting out virtually all of the poignant material between jon and qhorin leaving out virtually all the dark character development from aryas arc to name but a few  the utter travesty that is the shows version of the house of the undying takes the cake in fact it takes the whole dessert tableiwe will be writing a longer piece on how poorly handled both dany and danys whole storyline have been in the second season contrasting it with the very clear purpose of qarth in the books so right now i am just concentrating on the house of the undyingi cant wait to read that linda i keep complaining to my nonreader husband that they have really done a number on the character of danaerys its really aggravating in fact all of the women in got have been written with the same broad brush spunky bitchy shrewish here comes sansa oh look shes a bratty smart aleck here comes shae oh look shes a spunky smart aleck takecharge girl here comes whoever that replacement jeyne westerling is oh look isnt she spunky takecharge and sociallyconscioushere comes dany oh watch her scream about whats hers here comes brienne oh look how spunky and takecharge she isi understand that there was alot of handwringing about the treatment of women in westeros last season but come on cant we have one woman who is multifaceted or even gasp sweet innocent kindand still strong is the only way to be a strong woman by being bitchy grrrwe have as of yet not had a single mention of either the song of ice and fire or the prince that was promised in the series what more not only did they cut out the visions they cut the whole prophecy so far all we have gotten for dany is an abbreviated version of mirri maz duurs prophecyso they continue to cut out the past from the story and in addition to that they also cut out most of the prophecies both these are very significant elements of the story whatever the producers and writers might think a song of ice and fire isnt just about battles and boobsthe past still matters it enriches and makes the present more poignant well likely never see rhaegar now not to mention elia what viewers will care about them what viewers will care about rhaegar and lyanna when they ultimately have to become more important to the story what viewers will care particularly about the martells without any establishing of eliathe prophecieswell who can deny their importance as we see in a dance with dragons even the most obscure ones do come true just not in ways one might have expected magic isnt just dragons and othersagree linda asoiaf is one long complicated and possibly intertwined mystery i myself am constantly rereading trying to unravel grrms mystery in eacy nuanced scene memory halftold story awkward pauses etc its the heart of the book series but not apparently gota song of ice and fire is a multilayered and multifaceted story that also means that people do read it for different reasons some may take in all aspects of the story with near equal enjoyment others may favour some aspects and dislike others the mysteries of the past and the prophecies fuel a large amount of the discussion on the forums they are clearly important aspects for many many fans and the show has just ripped them out of the story almost wholesalefurious doesnt come close to describing what i am today nor does disappointedright there with you sisteri had said before the season started that for this season the only thing i really hoped for was that they would get the house of the undying right if not i would find it hard to continue watching since they didnt even try to get it right they just threw it in the trash i have absolutely no interest in watching any more unfortunately we have a lot tied up in the coverage of the show so ill probably have to keep watching to some degree anyway but i no longer look forward to new episodes because the story has been gutted of what matters the most to me and because i do not expect any of the scenes i truly care about to make it in at least not without being butchered beyond recognitionas far as i am concerned it is no longer an adaptation of a song of ice and fire it is an mainly an original story in the a song of ice and fire setting and it isnt particularly goodi almost quit during the season and it is no longer must see tv for me i am not sure i can live on one grrmpenned episode a seasoncooper56 how much can they change the story before it crosses the line from an adaptation to an inspired by where is that line for youfor those of you backlashing against us readers lindas post is not directed to you its directed to fans the readers of a song of ice and fire sbjackdaw hits the nail on the head at what point do the changes to the story mean that got is no longer an adaptation it seems to me that it has definitely gone the way of inspired by which is fine for those of you who just like watching the hbo series ill be a reader who may be bowing out and sharing with my fellow readers the reasons whylinda thank you so much for your post i felt very alone in my opinion"

"Arrogant Bastard",2012-06-04,"agree that not only was the house of the undying a letdown but the whole sequence didnt make much sense first theyve been mentioning this house for like five episodes by now and giving how creepy pyat pree is i expected and im sure new viewers did also something sinister and creepy inside instead we get dany wandering around a snow covered throne room and then having a loving conversation with her dead husband just anticlimactic what was the point of her seeing drogo and leaving out all the creepy visions and prophecies i really have no idea now to the stuff that doesnt make sense actually pyat prees reason for keeping dany in the house of the undying makes sense since his magic will be bolstered but really he didnt anticipate that dragons could burn him plus only a few episodes ago that dragon could barely roast a small piece of meat also how was dany able to infiltrate xaros mansion so easily hes now the king of qarth figured he would have increased his security plus she suddenly gained a bunch of dothraki who i thought died in the attack when her dragons were stolen"

"Castel",2012-06-04,"a whole bunch of things about this episode dont make sense i can see them cutting the prophecies but the entire plotline of the undying was just lackluster drogo being involved was just pointless and the ending somehow managed to be worse than in the book but at least the plot of the warlocks if not the house itself made sensewhat wasnt explained properly was why the boys had to somehow run to the wall the ironborn betrayed theon and presumably went home but by cutting out the burning of winterfell we dont know who fucking did it if it was the ironborn then there should be no problem and the boys should be able to stay since the castle is now in the hands of the boltons stark men if it was the boltons then i could see the argument here but it wasnt shown i think they just assumed that people knew this from the books or wouldnt look too deeply into ityeah i agree i didnt think it was something dany would do shes tough but not at all sadistic made her seem rather targaryen in all the wrong ways actually most of her scenes this season several of which have her screaming and ranting have seemed pretty targaryeny by which i mean crazy which of course is the exact opposite of the portrait of danaerys that martin has spent the series painting dany is sadistic look at what she did to the men at yunkai it was pure sadism and i think it fits dany pretty well she has this fucked up idea of justice depending on what exactly doreah did i can totally see her pulling this she did it to the yunkai edited by castel 04 june 2012  0300 am"

"Lord Varys",2012-06-04,"well only yesterday i said to my girlfriend that id be pissed beyond ends if they would fuck up the house of the undying guess what im pissed right now the whole qarth story was a great joke all in itself but the house of the undying is insufferable and its good to see that there are actually people who care about the fact that this damned series is an adaptation which means that it is supposed to show us with different means pretty much the same thing which we can read in the books mostly stuff gets changedcut down due to budget reasons but thats not the case here they have the budget and the time to make this a faithful adaptation of a song of ice and fire whenever they change characters motivations and dialogue they do so because they want to not because they have to so please stop rephrasing that philippa boyens crap about the stuff you cant do in a movie im referring here to the statements of one of the writers of the lotr script trying to explain how the character of faramir could not possibly have been in the movies as jrrt described him in the book  which is of course crap you can do pretty much everything in a movietv series especially with characters but back to the house of the undying this is very much the heart of the whole series it is the moment where the role of one of the main characters as a prophesied savior is revealed it is the explanation why on earth should we care about a character whose story is after two volumes still completely disconnected from the other main characters it is the explanation why daenerys targaryens eventual return to westeros will be important no one  including myself and linda ive no doubt  did ever expect to see all the visions of dany has in the book but we all had reasons to believe that there would be at least some of them maybe cut a bit changed somewhat with some additional expository dialogue think about the aerysrossartscene they could have done it without explaining anything since we already knew that aerys targaryen intended to burn down kl when jaime killed him instead of showing us a glimpse of stupid dead drogo they could have given us viseryss specter as some kind of spiritual guide to dany explaining background stuff when necessary ie elia and rhaegar hell they could have even made rhaegar talk directly to dany after the vision with aegon and elia telling her that he was wrong that neither he himself nor aegon were the promised prince but she it is you sister you have woken the dragons from stone you are the promised one this would have delivered the message to the audience the fact that daenerys targaryen has woken dragons from stone makes her some kind of a special savior figure the same savior figure in fact melisandre wrongly believes stannis to be and why on earth would they want to cut all that dialogue about the treasons the mounts the fires and so on those are not spoilerish no one really does understand whats exactly meant by that although one might think right now that meereen is going to become a huge pyre in twow so whats the harm in making danys fate mysterious and special by delivering a bunch of prophesies about her and finally why on earth would they omit the undying ones themselves along with their undead heart the undying sucking out danys life while lulling her to sleep with prophecies about her future life had all the potential of a gruesome horror scene instead they have gutted this whole thing and they cannot rectify this mistake in the future this is not about delaying some secondary characters it is a huge change and it simply doesnt work not as an adaptation of the series and actually not really in the tv series itself care for an example 1 xaro is now king of qarth yes where are all those guards who were blocking danys entrance back in garden of bones surely the new king would not let his own house unguarded while fucking with his guests most of danys dothraki were killed in the show and she had only very few left in the first place when she approached qarth so how on earth should it be possible that this ragged band should be able to lock xaro within his very own walls 2 whats the point of an house of the undying if there are no undying warlocks to found in there had they called it pyat prees evil doppelgangerhouse or warlocks lair it would have made somewhat more sense but i still have some hope left on one point linda assumes they wont introduce the martells properly for that there is still some time left yes they have not once mentioned her name until now but with asos spanning two seasons there will be more than enough time to establish dorne the martells and their background in a way the audience can understand the tyrell presence at kl alone will make the enmity between the reach and dorne a theme to be discussed and if they dont totally fuck of oberyn martell as well we will hear a lot about elia in the future edited by lord varys 04 june 2012  1120 am"
"Former Lord of Winterfell",2012-06-04,"as to the confusing images and all i mean maybe but the fact is that if you look at the huge following that shows like lost and xfiles and twin peaks had at their heights people absolutely adore being confused by symbolism and images and foreshadowing they love mysteryyes but mystery was all lost really had asoiaf has a rambunctious plot wild characters multiple complex threads going at the same time etc there is a lot going on i think in the context of everyone else that is going on mystery elements would more easily get lostbe confusing and unlike lost those of us who love all those additional mysteries still have the books for augmentationthis show has drained almost every ounce of mystery out of the narrative in the novels and simply leaves with basic plot stuff like who will winim not so sure about that and i wouldnt assume all those mysteries wont be raised later but i think it is far more difficult to do that in the context of a show that is already extremely busy with an audience that is looking for some resolution of mysteries within the season i mean the catspaw used to kill bran was an issue in agot but we didnt get resolution for that until asos i can see why people running a tv show dont want to bring up what turns out to be a rather inconsequential mystery remember the generic letdown here when it was discovered to be joffrey in season 1 that wont be answered until season 3 or 4 they can revive that mystery in season 3 or 4 and address it then perhaps in the context of jaime and cersei discussing how out of control joffrey is but otherwise i think it is tough to expect an audience to follow all of those mysteries that arent resolved until seasons down the roadnor the identity of jon arryns murderer and they appear to clear up who sent mandon moore after tyrion  a question thats never resolved in the novels so far as i can telli thought the tv show made it fairly clear that arryn was murdered because he knew too much and i dont see how else you can do the reveal on moore on screen i agree it wasnt resolved in the series but it certainly was at least hinted at and its a worthwhile plot point to bring outthats probably the greatest thematic deviation of the show from the novels an antipathy to mystery george uses it to great effect as tens of thousands hundreds of thousands more likely of posts discussing all the mysteries in the series reveal it was the last thing  literally the last thing  i ever believed that the showrunners would jettison in their adaptation the first season hinging as it did on mysteries or characters exploring things that were mysteries to them certainly gave no hint that the second season would be devoid of themas i said i think what theyll probably do is reemphasize mysteries in the seasons in which they get resolved"

"Castel",2012-06-04,"as for the show not being a good adaptation idk i personally dont mind them going their own way after all they paid grrm huge dumptrucks of money  as he ofts reminds us to be able to do what they want and bring the book to a wider audience even if it means thematic changes but some changes make things less clearas far as im concerned d  d arent obligated to follow the books the problem is that for a series like this the books are filled with shit that is important even if it is difficult to film i dont know its a tough scale to balance but that said some changes have just been gratuitous and make less sense when you follow the rest of the bookscharacters are written a certain way it doesnt always work to follow most of their characterization and ignore certain integral parts of it personally shaetyrion is an example of this their whole relationship falls flat to me but i guess thats the book reader in me speaking outthe scene at the end was alright but i dont get how sam survives since he is surrounded and wish he killed onethey let that guy from the pilot go didnt they they seem to be dicks like thatpeople like to be confused by tv shows why else would lost or the xfiles be so popular  people like to be left with things to guess things to wonder aboutsometimes lost and xfiles are popular in popculture reference terms but look at shows like csi and see how popular those are and they are notorious for not leaving anything ambiguous depends i guessas it is this finale left us with absolutely nothing to discussi think that this is a budget problem blackwater wiped them out and they could only do 10 episodes without quality dropping so we ended up with a situation where they were just trying to deal with the current threads and didnt have any more episodes to add things hopefully the split next season will help resolve this edited by castel 04 june 2012  1151 am"

"gogorath",2012-06-04,"i think some missed pretty much the entire point of danys arc in the show which is understandable because its not the same as the books but man putting khal drogo in there was not a cheap fanservice moment dany is making a choice  the same choice that tyrion makes and about five other characters in the episode anyway i love the backstory and history in the book that kind of depth is ideal for a book its never going to be here and nothing you say is going to change that its probably best just to get over it but aside from that what is the point of qarth in the books dany learns some of her past but i dont really see her growing at all maybe i missed something in the books and i much prefer the hotu in the books but i dont really see a thematic change for dany until the last moments of a storm of swords where she finally chooses to help people instead of going after what is hers edited by gogorath 04 june 2012  1158 am"

"jons nissa",2012-06-04,"personally speaking magic is the thing i hate the most really the only thing i hate in this series i dont like how cat is undead i dont like how the white walkers are percieved as monsters for now at least i do feel that grrm will give them more complexity in the next 2 books or at least i really hope so and most of all i really dont like the prophecies the whole shadow baby thing almost turned me off the books while i was reading them last summer and the prophecies also have the same effect on me its a good thing martin has built such a beautiful world and political story and thats why i readsimiliarly most nonreaders probably share the same feelings with me in that they would rather have the show grounded in realism and imo ommitting prophecies are a big part of thatjust my 2 cents i only started reading after the first season so i was drawn in more because of the realism and the fact that this was supposed to be a fantasy book with very little magic which it is tbfedit i dont mind some of the stuff like the fm which i love the maesters candles and oppression of the past magic and dragons its really just cheap plot tools like the shadow baby or catelyn survivng or hell even berric being reborn like 5 times and things that give away the future even if its in a very hard to detect manneri dont mind the magic in the story but i really hate the undead that said i watch a very observant nonreader he has really caught on to many of the subtle things in the series but when we spoke after this episode he started the conversation with that was weird i reminded him that there have been 20 episodes and maybe 2 or 3 minutes of weird to which he replied i dont like weird i told him get used to it it gets weirderi think one thing we forget is hbo has marketed this series as the fantasy show for people who dont like fantasy what keeps most viewers glued to their tvs is the human interaction and ive heard the show referred to as the medieval version of the wire several times the fact that the magic is so rare in westeros and even rarer on the show makes it easy to forget its there so viewers are really thrown for a curve with shadow babies zombies and white walkers i predict a great uproar when uncat is introduced"

"tearloch",2012-06-04,"i have read all the books and i absolutely love them i have watched all the episodes of the hbo series and i absolutely love them i think the one thing that most people are losing site of is that this is tv it is a different media than writing a book one of the things i always tell people about the book is that grrm is a master of dialogue and setting the scene his dialogue is so indepth and requires the reader to be very inventive most readers often have to go back and reread sections to pick up something they missed what my point is that tv does not work this way hbo will lose viewers much quicker if they went that route so what they did was cut out almost all prophecy stuff take alot of dialogue and make it visual sometimes changing points of the story in the process but in the end they end up at virtually the same end point if you spend your 1 hour a week dissecting the episodes as they air trying to see how it differs from the books you will never enjoy the series"

"Fez",2012-06-04,"i dont much like what they did with hotu myself not because it wasnt different though just because i dont think what they were trying to do worked i mean warlock dean pelton wdp was essentially doing the same thing the undying were keeping danys mind occupied while taking advantage of her life energy the difference being that wdp wanted to do it for centuries meaning dany basically needed to go into a magical version of the matrix but whats so appealing about a throne room in ashessnow i think it wouldve been far better if when she entered the throne room it was her coronation and the place looks full of life and joy and only when she hears her dragons cry and she turns her back on the throne does it turn into what we see similarly when she leaves the tent that has drago and rheago it should freeze over or burn away or something along those lines that way it makes it clear that dany doesnt care about these things not as much as she does her dragons and then she can wake up and confront wdp thats a hotu that makes sense and i think would still be thematically consistent with the books as far as dany goes which to get to my main point is whats important about that scene in the books anyway the visions themselves were window dressing fan service from grrm for us the undying couldve been showing dany visions of naked covorting men and it wouldve had the same effect on her character the visions themselves arent important only that there are visions as for the larger issue that this is a wholly original story now or some such i think thats a completely inaccurate characterization grrms used many times the metaphor that his story is garden and for my purposes im now going to ask view it as a mountain and the books are a path up it there are certain deviations that the path took towards things that grrm found interesting so that a closer look could be had a cliff overlook or a waterfall and other things that you can only see from the path in the far distance a particularly large tree or a patch of berries but essentially its a path up a mountain and the show is just another path up the mountain at some points its in the same place as grrms path but it avoids some of his deviations and goes off on some of its own maybe it thinks cliffs are boring but really likes large trees the thing is though its still a path up the same mountain and when youve reached the top youll overall have the same experience regardless of which path you took you climbed a mountain with just a few variations in what you saw on the way up it both paths are equally valid they get to the top just like any preferences or opinions that any of us have about the storymountain are equally valid its my belief that once a work has been created every textuallysupported interpretation is equally valid and an authors word is no more canon then anyone else unless it gets written into a future book dd have their preferences and opinions and are adapting the story in a way that they think is interesting and will appeal to viewers if you dont like it youre free to criticize or not watch it or whatever else it is you want to do but you cant deny that its not the same story anymore they are adapting it in their own way bu theyre climbing the same mountain its not like they said screw it climbings hard and went off to go swimming instead"

"tearloch",2012-06-04,"if this was the intention it seems to have backfired spectacularly since most people both book readers and not seem to dislike or even hate robb because of the talisa romancewell that differs from most of my nonreader friends there are a couple that have voiced concerns for robb breaking his oath to marry a frey but they also acknowledge that the freys dont seem trustworthy and he is probably better off getting away from them i wonder how yours will feel after the red wedding"
"LordofWinter",2012-06-04,"i sympathize with disappointment in the house of the undying sequence but i think the opening post is a huge overreaction filled with extreme hyperbole and exaggeration yes it sucked that we didnt get to see rheagar and elia yes i would like more prophecy in the show but 75 of what happened in this episode still came from a song of ice and fire nearly every scene led to where these characters will be going in a storm of swords from arya given the coin and looking for her mother to jon joining the wildlings to robb marying someone else and breaking his pact with walder frey to claim that its an original story in the asoiaf world is clearly not the case1 i fing love that youre starburns2 while i understand your position i think what youre failing to understand at least from the perspective of fans who have a problem with this and other episodes is that were not upset about the scenes theyve done its that were upset over how theyve altered those scenes yes many of those scenes were ones we saw in the books but they have been changed drastically not just the feel of these scenes but dialogue and certain characters actions as well until it reaches a point where it no longer resembles the novels we readexamplesin the novels catelyn is miles away from robb when he decides to marry jeyne not a guest at the wedding this may seem to be a small change but in reality is huge reading that section of the books you the reader think that this was a plausible mistake on robbs part which was only possible because his mother wasnt around to prevent him from acting so rashly whereas the show has just discredited catelyns intelligence respect and responsibility as a mother and provider for her family so that robb is seen to do something so incredibly foolish almost to spite his mother and her previous careless actions by allowing both robb and cat to act so stupidly without them having the justifiable excuse of grief over the deaths of bran and rickon youve turned sympathetic characters into rightfully doomed characters the house of the undying was a major scene in those novels so not doing them correctly simply negates the fact that you did them at all there was literally no purpose for dany to go to thotu without the night shade and the visions as a viewer and a reader i excepted the contrived theft of her dragons as them finding a more exciting purpose for getting there because of time constraints budgetary issues casting etc but once youve made her arrive at thotu why would you not show the visions that are the sole purpose of that scene  sorry rlj fans looks like they will be skipping over any and all clues of that this series because it would have costed too much or confused the story to simply add a blue rose to the wall that is standing directly behind dany or to cast two characters for one scene in that throne room in kl for the aerys and rhaegar vision  we can show you more about why the red wedding will happen but our costs wont allow for a dinner table and a man with a wolves head  three betrayal you willnope so its not important to underline or even display for that matter the basis of danys mistrust for the next three seasons so were just going to keep playing this i will take what is mine with fire and blood crap over and over alright but prepare for the world to hate her the exclusion of garlan tyrell was just one of laziness in my opinion youre talking about a character that you needed for two scenes and one who didnt really need any dialogue all we have to do is see him standing next to his brother and tywin lannister in renlys armour and then the next scene his identity is explained just before he leaves kl to return home youre telling me with all of the extras theyve got walking around set you couldnt just give one a raise for a day of shooting i dont buy it who burned winterfell remember when you read the books how fucked up it was that everybody thought it was theon and the ironborn when you knew that it was actually ramsay that sick bastard well good thing you read those books than wait what happened to bronn so hes not head of the city watch anymore did they mention anything about a lordship or any reward why isnt he available to see tyrion a man he the last time we saw him claimed to be his friend okay this one i had a huge problem with rattleshirt is the most flip flopping bastard ever an example of really bad writing in my opinion scene one hes not yours to killcrow next scene let them fightwhat the fuck just happened therearya stark the sweet twisted little girl who has absolutely no reason to be a sweetly twisted as she will be coming up in the next couple of seasons that is unless they change her story completely i think someone else here mentioned that brienne is killing people left right and center to compensate for the lack of dead bodies on aryas conscience"

"One Hand Clapping",2012-06-04,"what the second series proved to me was how resistant the books are to adaptation after agot robb is a pivotal character and perhaps the noblest and most tragic one of the series  but because hes not a pov we get to see next to nothing of him until the red wedding  so they had to make up a whole bunch of stuff to make us care about him before he gets offed marrying him off to some pertbottomed pacifist from volantis is indeed silly but still makes much more sense than by the way robb bumped into and married some lannister bannermans daughter who youve never heard of and wont hear very much of  and oh look everyones dead anyway  the house of the undying and danys entire season arc was indeed botched but acok doesnt exactly give the writers much to work with the treatment of arya is harder to defend but it did give them a chance to bring tywin in from offstage and justifies whatever they are paying the great charles dance who otherwise would have been almost completely absent until the end of blackwater and no tv series can support the insane proliferation of characters that has reduced the books to a plodding travelogue where nothing happens for hundreds of pages and i for one am hoping that griff victarion and whatever the dornish prince was called are just completely excised when they get to the misbegotten mess that is adwd  so for instance collapsing a whole bunch of roles into osha makes perfect sense plus its all very well to moan about the lack of prophecy but unlike us the showrunners know how the books are supposed to end  and given georges past and present productivity rate if they dont finish the saga for us no one will so maybe the whole rhaegarlyannajon thing is just a red herring maybe jon will stay dead because george can think of no way of getting him away from the wall maybe fat sam and brienne are in fact the second and third heads of the dragon they might as well be given the amount of space dedicated to their tedious travels  the writers allegedly know this stuff and we dont  and probably never will from the books unless the publishers somehow manage to impose a cowriter on george"

"Nagisa Furukawa",2012-06-04,"finding out that robb was married next season without any warning would really be wtfis anyone actually saying this is the way to gofrom what i can tell it seems like most of us who dislike robbtalisa dont dislike the very idea that robb having sex and then marrying the girl he had sex with is onscreen rather than offscreen after all tv is a visual medium show dont tell etc but that we dislike the execution of it and how vastly different the actual circumstances and romance are from the booksmore than anyone else its the lack of grief about bran and rickons deaths that drive me crazy same with cat freeing jaime edited by nagisa furukawa 04 june 2012  0154 pm"
"Former Lord of Winterfell",2012-06-04,"i watch with a handful of friends who havent read the books why would they complain they dont realize yet or never will at the rate that the show is removing relevant plot material what details theyre missing that would help them to understand characters and whats to come latermy point is that most viewers i know already think there is more than enough detail in general and while details on current characters right now may be important an obvious place to reduce information overload is in cutting detail about what is going to happen much latera number of times one of them will ask who is that again or why did he do that and i just shake my head because the show through lack of detail not excess didnt do a good job explaining the character or the eventin almost every case that detail has been provided its just that it gets lost in so much of the other detail i think the sheer mass of detail in this story is just a struggle to deal with no matter how you try to do it but i will say that ive enjoyed it and that people who havent read the books have really enjoyed it as well that leads me to believe the showrunners are getting a lot more right than they are wrong especially since viewers are not fungible and some are going to grasp things more quickly than others its quite the tightrope for the showrunners to walk"
"tearloch",2012-06-04,"if you understood neds honor and the impact it had on his sons primarily jon and robb youll understand why they make the decisions they make through the rest of the series robb made a mistake and felt honor bound to correct it with the only way he knew how tvrobb just looks like a child who cant keep his promise because hed rather marry for what he perceives to be love in our society its not a big deal to marry whomever you want in westeros you promise to marry someones daughter for them doing you a significant service you dont just break that promise on a whim especially when breaking that promise has far reaching implications so we are back to the you obviously dont understand comments i do understand neds honor but you are actually contradicting your point so robb being honorable like his father marrys the maiden he bedded to avoid dishonoring her but in the process does a much larger dishonor by breaking his marriage vow to the freys you cant argue that he did one thing for honor when it causes a creator dishonor to his family and eventually costs him his life his fathers best friend dishonored many women even his own father had a bastard its not like jeyne was the daughter of one of his bannermen she would have been viewed as spoils of war in westoros my point is that in the end robb does dishonor himself and his house by marrying someone other than the frey girl my personnel belief which is fairly obviously shared by dd is that robb doing it for what he feels is true love is much more honorable than doing it to prevent disgracing the daughter of a defeated bannerman of his sworn enemy"

"One Hand Clapping",2012-06-04,"margaery also seems to be a function of george not making her or any other tyrrell a pov character and so leaving her flat and lifeless but while a book can deal with a character basically being a cypher a tv show cant they need to fill another two seasons with constant returns to kings landing  but actually not that much happens there in asos until joffreys wedding and tyrions trial and it seems obvious to me that they will do this by making margaery a real rival to cersei so she just has to be a much stronger character the same may also apply to robbs love interest  as they cant afford to show battles and marches they need some other source of conflict and drama within the stark camp as well as a clearer rationale for boltons betrayal than the book gives us  so i suspect she going to become a far stronger player than a jeyne westerling could have been"

farseriously with all the negative comments and serious nitpicks on this thread you chose my comment to harp on huhpng classbbcemoticon althuh i love the television series and i do not consider the books to be a bible concerning the show but the television series has lost the magicspark shown in s1 it still makes for great television but i feel the television audience is being cheated out of an even better story the first season lead me to the books and the books gave me a greater appreciation for the first season but the second season has been a bit of a disappointment it seems to me that the series has been watered down to appease the masses while i totally understand why this is unnecessary it is still a bit upsetting the books are far better than the television series imo a clash of kings makes game of thrones season 2 look like a jokeimo sorry i simply wish for my nonreader friends to see that this series is more than a dark soap operawheres the harm in that i respect the writers of the show and have even enjoyed a few of their changesdelays but sometimes they go a little too far imo happypng classbbcemoticon alt ros may actually have a purpose now as something other than boobgirl which is kind of cooli have always seen ros as an important character in the television series we discover a lot about the other characters through her i feel that people are so focused on the sex usually included in her scenes that they miss the real point behind them winkpng classbbcemoticon alt what i did have a problem with was the decision to even include the hotu if youre going to cut the prophecies the entire point of the hotu was the prophecies removing the prophecies but leaving the hotu gives us exactly what we gota hokey and awkward scene that didnt drive the plot didnt develop characterization that didnt really have a point honestly it just seemed like a fan service scene without the service like they got together and decided all the fans would be pissed if it wasnt included but then removed the sole reason why the fans wanted it included it just seems like that time could have been better spent elsewherei was originally upset about thotu but then i rewatched the episode as a show watcher instead of a bookreader and it does add substance to danys story she leaving that life behind and moving forwardsomething she had not yet done also we must look at the visions as new hintsclues that can be left open to interpretation id like to thank you both for your really calm and reasonable defense of the hbo series unlike what someone wrote above rudeness and namecalling are not just part of the internet at least not on these forums though you both disagreed with the op you did so respectfully and stated your defense of the showanyway thanks for showing the classless folks above how disagreement on asoiafwesterosorg is donethe reason i came to this forum was the ability of its members to have intelligentcourteous debates i refused to post last night after my initial post was attacked by people that obviously didnt understand what i was trying to say it was horrible im so happy that the mods stepped in and corrected the issue biggrinpng

assassin in training with no darkness to her character bronn is 100 hilarious and his lack of moral compass is not touched on the hound is one dimensional and most of his good lines ended up with littlefinger who in turn shows his hand to all and sundry the backstory with rhaegar and lyanna is also totally losti feel bronns moral compass has been touched on at least twice especially during his conversation with tyrion regarding the killing of the bastards the problems with the hound were corrected for me during the blackwater episode happypng classbbcemoticon alt  i think you mean when they go cliche it will likely succeed exactly why true blood is so successful its camp mass appeal lowest common denominator i sometimes watch true blood because i expect just that completely mindless and soulless cheese but season 1 of got was a good indication that we were supposed to expect something more from this show it seems however that season 1 was a flukethe idea of this series being butchered like true blood scares the hell out of me some changes are necessary but to throw the books aside and create a new story is disrespectful sadpng classbbcemoticon alt  one aspect of the adaptation that i find unique and ironic is that the book readers are the ones who need to have a little patience usually its the nonbook readers let this story play out let these writers finish what they started then cast judgement people are going to drive themselves mad nitpicking every episode i choose to view the adaptation as a whole agreegif classbbcemoticon altagree  great advice i would

"SerMixalot",2012-06-04,"and this where i realize that i have so little in common with most of you there is no sympathy for a man who falls in love robbs story in the book is pretty unbelievable as i reader i let it go because you know the rest of the book is awesome but on closer inspection having to actually see what robb is thinking the idea that dishonoring a noble woman is somehow a more compelling interesting or more justifiable reason for his decision than being in love is odd to meits different although robb in the book isnt all that honorable  he breaks a vow to get married as well but i dont know why it makes him unsympathetic theres a million and one romances that involve people leaving others at the altar for their true love and no one finds those people unsympathetic the bridges of madison county was insanely popular and wasnt she just cheating on her husbandwell i wont go so far as to say your perception of grrms work is wrong or misconceived each individual interpretation has its own merits but from my perspective grrm goes to endless effort to detail a world where honor and duty outweigh our modern notion of love in fact the few examples of where this romantic love it appears to have occurrd in spite of an not because of the societal roles it is extremely unlikely that a king in grrms world would forsake his vows for a commoner or a noble lady grrm presents robbs falling because if fits in with the world he has created tv robbs actions are simply not consistent with the world grrm has created for the following reasonsa a king can essentially have any number of women they want in fact paramours are commonb romantic love as presented in the show did not occur in the books i can think of no romantic relationship between nobles that was romance base and not politically motivatedagain robbs romantic pursuits simply do not fit in the world grrm has created and that leaves aside the actions of a single woman wandering around camps speaking to nobles the way she does etc they are in fact an anachronism robb sleeping with a noble maid in an act of grief is completely consistent with the world that grrm createdwhere marriages are arranged where honor and duty is everything where romance simply doesnt exist for nobles his screwed up sense of honor to jeyne fits perfectly with that world as well the romantic story presented by dd is bad enouch on its anachronistic face but is far worse because it drastically changes the characters and their interactions from the books the rw is a tragedy almost a classic tragedy where the hero is undone by one tragic mistake in retrospect you can watch the slow inexorable slide to him getting shot with quarrelsthe tv show has set up robb to be anything but sympathetic because he is on screen doing something stupid against the advice of other sympathetic and wise characters that is not a tragic flaw that is stupidity thus making the rw less a tragedy and more a deserved punishment"
"Former Lord of Winterfell",2012-06-04,"tv robb is a selfish baby who is clearly unfit to be king and who i dearly look forward to seeing roose bolton murder his motivations are just vile hes going to do what he wants because well he just does its entirely selfish thats the gripeaint that a bit harsh the point at which robb falls for her is when she is telling this story of how a slave saved her life so she ended up being unable to abide slavery and wanted to devote her life to taking care of other people rather than living the pampered life of a volantian noble she basically confesses all these noble character traits to him traits that are more advanced and generally out of character even for most westerosi  and thats what ends up breaking down his defenses she got him by appealing to his belief in virtue and true nobiiltyrobbs flaw is that hes too idealistic he thinks her noble sentiments and virtue trump the virtues of an arranged political marriage its immature but it is hardly a vile motivation he sees in her more of what he thinks is needed in westeros"

"DragonAge93",2012-06-04,"i think you are going a little too overboard here i love the books through and through but i understand some things in those books are hard to translate to a screen even a movie with a big budget couldnt handle something like the hotu why show rhaegar and such when the audience would have no idea who he was or what they were referring to in the books you have unlimited freedom where you can get inside a character and explain things like this in a show you cant get inside a characters head unless you do it in a very cliche sort of way some things were changed but we are still up to where asos begins basically all the plots like jons that were changed eventually led up to where it ended in acok killing qhorin and now going to see mance dany albeit a very different journey in qarth she nonetheless visited the hotu like in the book again under different circumstances but now shes out and is getting a ship where shell no doubt meet barristanarstan and strong belwas and her asos story will pick up arya she has escaped harrenhal and is on her way to her mother and brother and might be heading to riverrun like in the book since we are getting it next season shell run in to the brotherhood without banners and her story will continue and with the ww attack on the fist of the first men just like in the books although sam may be cowering behind a rock who cares were still most likely gonna be getting an awesome battle on the fist like in the novel and sam will most likely use the dragonglass to kill a ww it sounds like you are ultimately giving up on the show just because it deviated from the books which was necessary due to budget time and the nonbook audience who they have to cater to just as much as us book readers you gotta admit though that it is still the best thing on television and the only thing really of its kind i think you should treat them as two separate things now the books are the books the show is the show its an adaption lotr was in no way a faithful adaption to its source material and yet most of its hardcore fans accept that and love those movies for what they are asoiaf has and probably never will be again adapted before and you have to applaud benioff and weiss for tackling such a huge complex world more complex than tolkiens world and peter jackson adapting that if you thought this series would be an exact wordforword scenetoscene adaption then you honestly need to look deeper into adaptions and what not just my two cents"

"Bride of Winter",2012-06-04,"this post describes why robbs books actions are classic it is a classic tragedy tale a hero undone by a single tragic flaw in this case by his action to marry the woman he dishonored in a moment of weakness until that mistake robbs life was one victory after another transcedent rising star after this it is one slow path to destruction after this edmure defeats tywin ruining robbs plans he returns to find jamie escaped he must execute lord karstark he then travels through the skies weeping tears to his death that is a classic tale of the downfall of a heroinstead we have a story of a boy making mistake according to dd it is because he questioned honor and duty because all those around him did including the last holdout to thishis mother this is actually an anachronistic theme to grrms work ie a far more nihilistic and modern conflict robb does not make one mistake he does not have a flaw he rebels against his parents supposed lack of consistency he falls in love is there anything more cliched than that blechdd convert the perfect tragic hero into a cliche it is rare and often successful when shows can successfuly present that tragic heros fall from grace it takes good writing good acting and courage i firmly believe that the actors could have carried it outyou basically completely summarized my issue with dds take on the storyline what i find the most upsetting which i dont think is nitpicky at all is that his story could have very reasonably been done practically verbatim from the books and had a very strong impact theres no need to adapt any of it  hell robb isnt even a pov character and just through his dialogue and actions we see hes a perfect tragic hero if anything seeing more of robb and giving him more of a character and personality should just make his downfall seem even more massive instead dd just took the character of robb and ran in the complete opposite directionplus its a huge shame because i definitely think the actor who plays robb could have pulled it off he does what he can but unfortunately now hes stuck simply being really good at playing a stupid teenager stuck in a cliche love story its a shame funny enough the only adapting of robbs storyline i recall dd claiming was that they were maturing him due to him being aged up a few years too bad showrobbs pretty much making 15yearold bookrobb look like stannis baratheon in comparison oh the irony"

"Kevin79",2012-06-04,"people that are complaining about the loss of prophecy stuff in the house of undying arent seeing the bigger picture of the tv series i think yes these prophecies are very important to the story however why do we think that they should only come from danys pov we must keep in mind that we need something for stannis and melissandre to do for the entirety of next season and i believe we got a glimpse of it in the finale there will be much discussion of prophecies and fates in scenes between stannis and melissandre as they will be looking into the fires for at least davos entire incarceration and time he is presumed dead so well get our azor ahai prophecies there and im sure quaithe will show up here and there to tell dany of her very own prophecies which is all she needs to hear about i also believe that dd have realized many of the complaints everyone here are going on about we must remember that they were book fans before they created the show and im sure it pains them that they had to mess up theons arc give jon less screen time and shorten the hotu but they did announce that book 3 would be split up so they could tell it over more than just ten episodes probably because they realised how rushed some of the plot points were in season 2 with the split they should finally be able to give the characters room to breathe in their own scenes and im willing to bet that the best seasons of the show are still to come because of this all you people that are so quick to condemn the show should give it another year at least for this reason alone if they manage to still mess up character motivations and condense incredible plot points after season 3 then i wont be as quick to defend the show anymore however like i said with more time to adapt book 3 they should pull off one hell of a season or two"

"King Tommen",2012-06-04,"it can be argued that many of the episodes in season two have not stood up on their own as quality television there have been some very clunky episodesnot just in my view but ive seen reviewers of the likes of alan sepinwall who seems to want to like the show despite its flaws voice criticisms about the structure and flow etc it is certainly not just book fans who criticize the quality of the tv seriesand i would argue that a large amount of those criticisms from nonreaders have come because the television show is attempting to tread as closely to the format of the novels as it possibly can which consequently is eschewing some of the advantages of the visual medium basically the two main gripes ive heard in these reviews in season 2 are that there is far too much jumping around from character to character and we dont get long enough to dwell on the individual storylines before jumping to another setting the second one is that there are way too many fn characters and it is extremely difficult to keep names relationships motivations and history straight if you were attempting to create an original epic fantasy series for television there is absolutely no way you would incorporate the number of characters and settings as asoiaf as it would end up being virtually unfilmableas in all books we get the luxury of having access to the narrators or in asoiafs case multiple povs inner monologue so we can better have the motivations feelings reminders of history and internal thoughts spread out over 1000s of pages even if you took 25 episodes to cover a book instead of 10 you would not get around this because there is only so much plot covered off in the acok and if tv shows and movies dont have plot points to hit then they will quickly run out of steam you will never be able to impart the same level of information because the tv show simply cannot put you inside the innermost thoughts of all the characters the way the books do and once you run out of plot or are attempting to stretch it out over a longer period of time then youll have your audience complaining that nobodys doing anything the characters are spinning their wheels and that the show is boring even this season you had some of those complaints coming up in the episodes prior to blackwater which for the most part were simply covering the corresponding chapters in acokacok was always going to be the hardest of the first 3 books to adapt because it took the 34 settings from season 1 and essentially doubled them by splitting up most of the characters and introducing new major characters with their own settings and relationships and while sos has just as many storylines to follow there are far more dramatic plot points to hit with cathartic payoffs mostly that have been set up through the first 2 seasons season 2 has had the toughest job because it had to set the structure and adjust the audience to the larger scope with a sos being given 20 episodes and much more satisfying plotdriven arcs it should make for a much smoother adaptation i would imagine that with more running time to work with we might start seeing some loosening of the format where we could see 4 or 5 stories addressed each episodes instead of the 8 or so this season with some characters sitting out an episode from time to time youll never get a blackwater type of format because there the books have too much to be covered to remain in one spot for a full 60 minutes but only having to cut back and forth between 45 stories would make a world of difference and allow some of them to breathe and not feel like pawns being moved into the next spot because thats where the book says theyre supposed to beplease be aware that nothing of this size and scope has ever been attempted before and because its the first time there will most likely be some hiccups along the way im sure there will be some lessons learned about pacing and characterization that will be applied in season 3 but the good part is that the heavy lifting has been done the vast majority of the major characters have been introduced to the series and the audience realizes that this is the scope that the show will be dealing in and will adjust accordinglyas for the 1 of the show fandom who live and die by the strict adherence to the source material the producers arent here to cater to your whims however crucial you believe them to be theyre trying to adapt this almost unadaptable tomb to the television medium because theyre also huge fans and want to see the adaptation on the screen"

"The Meeraculous Third Reed",2012-06-05,"and i would argue that a large amount of those criticisms from nonreaders have come because the television show is attempting to tread as closely to the format of the novels as it possibly can which consequently is eschewing some of the advantages of the visual mediumthe point is though is that many changes are not enforced littlefinger being less devious than he is in the novels why is this the gutting of any tension to the jonqhorin story or nobody knowing about the deaths of bran and rickon these are unnecessary changes i have no problem with changes in principle but some of them are change for changes sakeacok was always going to be the hardest of the first 3 books to adapt because it took the 34 settings from season 1 and essentially doubled them by splitting up most of the characters and introducing new major characters with their own settings and relationships and while sos has just as many storylines to follow there are far more dramatic plot points to hit with cathartic payoffs mostly that have been set up through the first 2 seasons season 2 has had the toughest job because it had to set the structure and adjust the audience to the larger scope with a sos being given 20 episodes and much more satisfying plotdriven arcs it should make for a much smoother adaptation i would imagine that with more running time to work with we might start seeing some loosening of the format where we could see 4 or 5 stories addressed each episodes instead of the 8 or so this season with some characters sitting out an episode from time to time youll never get a blackwater type of format because there the books have too much to be covered to remain in one spot for a full 60 minutes but only having to cut back and forth between 45 stories would make a world of difference and allow some of them to breathe and not feel like pawns being moved into the next spot because thats where the book says theyre supposed to beplease be aware that nothing of this size and scope has ever been attempted before and because its the first time there will most likely be some hiccups along the way im sure there will be some lessons learned about pacing and characterization that will be applied in season 3 but the good part is that the heavy lifting has been done the vast majority of the major characters have been introduced to the series and the audience realizes that this is the scope that the show will be dealing in and will adjust accordinglyi tentatively agreeas for the 1 of the show fandom who live and die by the strict adherence to the source material the producers arent here to cater to your whims however crucial you believe them to be theyre trying to adapt this almost unadaptable tomb to the television medium because theyre also huge fans and want to see the adaptation on the screeni think a better balance should be struck towards those who read and have read the books and those who watch casually"

"woweezowee",2012-06-05,"thats an important point a number of the changes are mucking about with the characters the changes in actions relate to changes to motivation and youre essentially getting quite different characters in some cases i thought arya was an especially egregious example  her character development essentially ends in episode 4 and the rest is tywin  arya hour which was brilliant once pretty good twice and rather boring thriceso theres two different stages to the argument herea they have changed certain charactersb  these changes are always or mostly badi dont think anybody here would dispute a id strongly dispute b as would i suspect a number of other people i think the television show improves some of the weaker characters in the books including cersei and indeed catelyn making the former far less of a onedimensional paperthin villain and the latter less winceinducingly stupid the arya character is certainly less dark at this point but is still an interesting well acted character with some great dialogue loved by most viewers so i dont see why the undoubted change is a problem same with brienne there are other character changes which are more illadvised but i think theyve improved some and made some worse  works out more or less even edited by woweezowee 05 june 2012  0558 am"

"Linda",2012-06-05,"a very interesting for me question to the op and the people who liked her post what are you going to do nowyou express your opinion that the show has failed you by pointing out its differences from the books you are more than furious house of the undying didnt live to our expectations are you going to stop watching the show and discussing about it in the forums focus entirely on the books is the show a lost cause to you or will you keep watching and hope that the next season will be better and closer to the book i am genuinely interested in your reactions to your disappointmentit is a good question and i wish i had an answer because it would make me feel better i have been watching this season with a sinking feeling in my stomach as the bad has come to outweigh the good for me but there was good too and i kept hoping that at least theyd get the house of the undying righti dont really post much as it is so it wont change that but given that covering the show essentially turns into fulltime occupation for us when it is airing it is really hard for me to just shut it out yes elio does the bulk of the writing anyway but theres a lot of behind the scenes stuff that i need to work on while i might occasionally feel like disassociating the site from the show entirely that wouldnt be fair to the communitythe sum of it is probably that i will get through episodes somehow to be able to do my work but i dont expect to get any more enjoyment from it except for some bits here and there the downside to anyone who disagrees with my opinions and cant take negative statements about the show is that ill probably keep making those from time to time because as long as i am involved i will get upset"

"A Bong of Ice and Fire",2012-06-05,"the only thing that really bothers me about the show is how theyve made littlefinger into a clumsy obvious moron ill never forgive that scene early in season 2 when he threatened cersei littlefinger from the books would never do something so stupid cersei would have him killed however i do like the actor that plays littlefinger so that mitigates the damage somewhat yes arya should be darker but whatever not that big a deal at least the show made theon into a much more interesting and entertaining character in the show than he was in books 12 of the series"
"Harle The Handsome",2012-06-05,"so theres two different stages to the argument herea they have changed certain charactersb  these changes are always or mostly badno stage b is that the changes are almost never as good or better than the original the only counterexample i can think of where a change actually better fit tv was altering tyrions plan to save the city from using a chain to trap them in blackwater bay and fling wildfire from catapults to using a single ship on a kamikaze run through stannis fleet"

"FrozenFire3",2012-06-05,"well off course their was disappointment on my side would totally nerdout if i saw rhaegar playing the harp a bloody massacre at a feast and a man with a wolfshead in the middle and a burnt golden viserys that would be awsome but would made no point to the tvaudience they do not know rhaegar would be tipped very early on about rw etc i am fine with the changes at hotu nothing of importance cant be added later by quatihe arstan of other characters the only wrong thing about this season for my was aryas story arc and the unrespectful demise of the halfhand the rest love it best thing since lost ended i would have totally loved to see rhaegar too but since they never mentioned him too much i think nonreaders would have been like hey whos this guy it would have been pretty confusing but i was hoping for the other small details blue rose etc instead they decided to change the visions  and mind me they look beautiful but were they not supposed to show dany what she would be doing in the next books of course two book still arent out still"
"woweezowee",2012-06-05,"no stage b is that the changes are almost never as good or better than the originalokay well i disagree with that assertion i gave a couple of examples of what i take to be improvements in the post you quote but if the issue is simply that you think the changed scenescharactersplots are not as good as the originals as opposed to outright bad surely its still possible to enjoy the show"
"Aapo",2012-06-05,"d d appear to be under the delusion that they are better writers than grrm there are so many brilliant layers and nuances in the books that have been scrubbed from the series and for what roz titties sexposition and scenes that give the impression that d  d probably read no more than the cliff notes versions of the booksafter latest episode huge amount of harsh words against david and dan so i would like to hear for once why dd would think they are better writers than grrmwe complain because we actually know why these missing characters scenes lines and prophecies are important and trying to eplain to people who never bothered to read the books why they are inportant is like trying to study hamlet with someone who never read the playmaybe we think some of those scenes or lines are important maybe some of them have no impact what so ever at the end or maybe it is not impossible to adopt all those things with 10 episodes per season and perhaps people should denounce hbo effort and lack of support than will of dd also we have different media and therefore budget limitations i have enjoyed this far much like i enjoyed lord of the rings when they were released so far i have seen similar character chances like peter did with aragorn in which case they in fact improved work of a great writer tolkien in some cases or caseglorfindelto clarify my opinion i would love to see all flashbacks dreams characters and perfect lines 11 from the books but i try to understand how hard it can be to produce show like this and i might be easy guy to satisfy  edited by aapo 05 june 2012  0654 am"

"gogorath",2012-05-28,"quick thoughts 1 the episode names have generally had little correlation to the episode at all and any way valar morghulis simply means all men must die so theres a lot that could apply to in other words aryas not the focus of this episode 2 jaqen offers to bring arya along in the book but she wants to get back to her family i expect this to happen like the book my big question is whether she will be captured and by whom 3 i expect dany to have the longest screentime and the hotu to be fairly epic we all know jons storyline as well and theons 4 it looks like brienne and jaime may get captured this episode which is a lot of action  but hoat isnt cast so it will be rorge and biter and extras ep 1 or 2 will see them taken to camp 5 other than tyrion waking up and no one thanking him im not sure what will happen in kings landing will they announce the marriages will tywin just tell tyrion will margaery show that seems like a lot considering we know we get littlefinger and sansa as well 6 looks like we are going to get stannis and melisandre at minimum i would think theyd find davos because thatd be an odd cliffhanger 7 theyve laid the groundwork for three blasts and i dont expect to get anything except the land horn blown possibly on black i think if they nail episode 10 well all look fondly back on this season as fantastic but the lingering question for me if episode 10 feels rushed is should they have had blackwater in episode 8 and sped up the early parts"

"The Scabbard Of the Morning",2012-05-29,"pretty sure luwins advice will be for theon to take the black as it was in the book the key to episode 10 will be the house of the undying it will either make or break the episode edited by the scabbard of the morning 29 may 2012  1238 am"
"Crown",2012-05-29,"im not optimistic about hotu regarding the visions i think its more likely they will just be strange kinda like the boat scene in charlie and the chocolate factory the rw vision would be too much of a giveaway and non book readers would have no idea wtf was going on with some random dude talking about the ptwp and the song of ice and fire i could see the little rat men ravishing the lady happen though there hasnt been much fucked up sex latelywasnt it strange to read aswell i had no idea what i was reading thats why the house of the undying is so awesomeme too hoping for a face change but then change back asap because as you so rightly describe him hes delicious a man is perfect as he is perfect perfectwe are going to get a face change the actor tom washalakika has said it in one of the earlier interviews before the season even started edited by crown 29 may 2012  0142 am"
"The Scabbard Of the Morning",2012-05-29,"i dont think there will be any visions in the house of the undying the most i can see is she gets a verbal prophecy like 3 betrayals 3 mounts and 3 fires and the dragon must have 3 heads as long as they hit those notes the visions are not important"

"GeorgeIAF",2012-05-29,"also i think that the final episode will be based mostly on dany"

"Arkash",2012-05-29,"yep that is for sure but otherwise like i said two posts earlier i have great fears that qhorin will not give the order to jon who will act on himself and i dont think we will have any robb  cat scene this episode or maybe just one where robb will say were moving to riverrun maybe"
"sennahoj",2012-05-29,"also i think that the final episode will be based mostly on danyi dont expect that there are too many other storylines that have to be served sure dany might have more screentime than in any other episode this season but not most of the episode and since its apparently 70 minutes long i am confident the show will do all the settings justice in terms of moving the story along to the cliffhangers we are expectingon that note the fact that the writers spoil us with a 70minute finale makes me hopeful for an extended opening episode to season 3"

"Nuttz",2012-05-29,"my predictions danys story will end with her leaving qarth i dont see it ending right after hotu its not a very good point to end the series it doesnt promise more plus i cant see them using the qarth set for just one episode next season whether or not they introduce arstan im not sure about it would be a good little cliffhanger of sorts to go with the promise of more when she leaves qarth i think theyll forgo the arstan deception though its much more obvious just dressing another character up in the books we have th unreliable narrator to trick us here that obviously wouldnt work plus revealing barristan would be more impactful than just some random old guy jons is fairly obvious hell kill qhorin at his orders and leave for mances camp there may be a glimpse of it as his final shot not sure where tyrions will end my best guess is it will be a bittersweet season end for him with obviously being one of the saviors of kings landing but being demoted to master of coin and geting no recognition then all of the other stuff with marg  joff and whatever theyre planning with ros sansa will most likely end with dontos im picturing the last line of her final scene will be dontos saying something along the lines of im going to help you escape i really really really hope that they will end davoss story on being picked up by salador theres going to be little enough story for them next season wihtout cutting a significant chunk out of it i can see it happening though as they also need to show stannis and mel somehow arya will obviously get the coin and see jaqen facechange but one thing im pretty sure of is thatshe will kill someone she ahsnt really had a big character moment this season in terms of a visually striking change most other characters have or will in this last episode plus arya just continuing on her way with hot pir and gendry is a weak end for her arc this season killing someone will add a big shock to the end of her arc and it works well within the story it will basically end like in the books just not in harrelhal i think jaime and brienne will end with them being captured by the bloody mummers this is based a lot on preview info where they seem to be fighting i would rather that was kept for next season and their scenes this episode be of them evading capture but thats a weak finish much liek aryas would be i think robbs will end with the revelation that talisa is jeyne and on top of that a lannister spy it would be another very strong ending much better than just were going to riverrun the evidence is there and if this doesnt turn out to be true then i will be very confused episode 5 is the main bit of evidence when tywin sends his cousin reginald back to lannisport this immediately comes off the heels of him speculating about how to defeat robb it doesnt strike me as odd that he would decide to use reginalds daughter jeyne as a spy the plan may have been to just spy on him or it may have been for jeyne to seduce robb and cause him to break his vows with the freys either way i definitely think all this and dont forget the mysterious parchment talisa was holding along with all the spy dialogue is related otherwise why waste time on introducing a new character not from the books that is a lannister why have tywin send him back the lannisport in the general vicinity of robb either that or robbs story ends with him hearing of bran and rickons death brans story will obviously end with him leaving winterfell and i have no idea where theons will end"
"King Tommen",2012-05-29,"heres where im having a tough time understanding whats going on with theons story theyve mentioned that ramsay will be arriving at winterfell to retake it for robb so he will be in the finale but they havent cast an actor for ramsay it doesnt make any sense if you dont want to budget the actor to be in this season reasonable given how many new characters they needed to introduce this season then why even have the sack of winterfell take place this season push it back to next year and introduce him like they will probably be doing with the reeds and the tullys or if you want to include the sack of winterfell but do it in a way where ramsay isnt directly involved and only introduced next year then dont have him be a part of the forces coming there you can get around an actor not being cast if youre only going to name check him as they did with stannis in season 1 or just have an extra because hes got absolutely nothing to do but sit there under a hood like with jaqen in season 1 but the sack of winterfell requires ramsay to interact with theon and take some significant action you cant just let an unseen untalking extra do that currently at winterfell theyve only got theon dagmer and luwin who are characters of any importance left how exactly is the audience supposed to understand exactly why the city will be burned down who is convincing theon to open the gates for them a couple of notes from previous episodes that are probably important robb ordered roose to relay to his bastard that all the ironborn men at winterfell except theon would be allowed to go back to pyke in exchange for letting them in and giving up theon which will obviously not be an order that is carried out theons men are clearly going to get slaughtered also when discussing war strategy before deciding to go back to kings landing tywin talked about the chances of robb attacking casterly rock and kevan noted that robb had sent a splinter force to retake winterfell and wouldnt dare march on casterly rock until he was at full strength im not sure if were supposed to take the splinter force to mean ramsays men from the dreadfort or not but that doesnt make a whole lot of sense if theyre talking about robb not being at full strength since ramsays men were never with him in the first place so does that mean that robb also has a small force that will meet up with ramsays men at winterfell to mirror the betrayal that happened with rodriks crew in the books outside the gate if so robbs crew would need the same jetpacks that littlefinger has to zip around westeros either that or ramsays men are choosing to all ride turtles to get to winterfell from the dreadfort im really very interested in how this will all come off in the finale i literally have no idea on what they plan on doing"

"Chris77",2012-05-31,"though i thinkhope that the sacking will be in s3 due to all the budget rightly spent on blackwater i think it could be possible to show theon readying his men see the army approaching and then cut to the crypts bran and company will later emerge into the ruined winterfell and find luwin dying he tells them of ramsays betrayal and sends them on their way i believe that we will see some flashbacks in the hotu dd said that there are no deleted scenes in the s1 boxsets because all material was used but we know of the starngling scene in the mad kings throneroom maybe they didnt have the screentime left to insert the flashbacks in s1 so they kept them for hotu i remember back in episode 8 there was a scene where a guard kicks ned awake which seemed out of context i think it was where the flashback was originally intended to fit this would also explain the rumors of a sean bean cameo even though he wasnt contracted for s2 and his bones do not count we havent even seen them maybe we will even get a toj scene which would be a great introduction to the finally confirmed reeds in s3 oh and i am sure that the 3 blasts will be the final scene  they will show sam talking about their significance in the previously on got to remind the non readers i think that xaro will kill pyat pree and send dany on her way anyways i will know more in 3 weeks since i am going on vacation tomorrow"

"victim",2012-05-31,"the best way for the sack of winterfell to unfold would be to have theon spurring his troops into action when they capture a mysterious envoyscout from the northern army which is rapidly approaching this envoy despite his terrible smell offers terms to the iron born that state robbs wish of all iron born men can live except theon and can perhaps be overheard by dagmer or black lorren when they see a relatively large army approaching the iron born ride out in surrender but are cut down despite of this thus the betrayal occurs theon and a few of his own retainers remain in the castle and shuffle to close the gates which of course they dont do in time and the castle is swarmed and begins to burn theon attempts to retreat with the envoy as his hostage before being attacked by northerners anyway the scene cuts as theon is hit and presumed dead the envoy dies in the commotion somehow the envoy is the original reek sworn servant and best friend to ramsay snow now ramsay needs a new reek its also a great way of showing ramsay as a little bit psychotic without even needing to show him its probably a little too detailed for one episode but i think with 70 minutes they could definitely save 1520 of them to go to this part of the storyline thats how long it should take"
"WillWork4NinjaPowers",2012-05-31,"my guess is the envoy of northern men lead by ramsay show up and theon views them from the tower lewin tell shim to surrender then as in the books as theon sees the dreadfort men turn on the others we dont need to see ramsays face lewin can tell him thats the bastard of bolton somehow ramsay will let theon know that he is on his side to get him to let them enter winterfell then the bolton men slaughter the ironborn thats how the season ends there or so i think"
"Ciglon",2012-05-31,"i dont see why ramsay would let the ironborn go home or why hed offer that to dagmer and not theonyou dont see why ramsay who has been sent to recapture winterfell will not want to try to convince the ironborn to walk out of their doublewalled castle in surrender with a false promise of release rather than try to take winterfell the heart of the north by force hed win but why bother when he can get them to just walk meekly out or put down their swords and let him enterand im pretty sure whatever that the envoy ramsay sends will shout the offer out to all the ironmen and dagmer the de facto leader of them will take him up on that this is not hard to believe at all and pretty plausibleyoure right on the whole not talking to anyone thing i think they just wanted to limit too many people talking this season so tvonly people wont get confused it probably costs less as well to just hire extras for ironmen that dont talk to theon or dagmeri like the idea of reek somehow dying throughout this and it would be great imo if theon orders his death as well perhaps that would really clarify to the audience why ramsay wants a new reek and perhaps might give a reason other than plain cruelty that he makes theon his new reek"
