1	Ran	2013-05-19	Book spoiler discussion of the show goes here, for those who want to discuss the episode in relation to the books, and with reference to spoilers from them.
This topic should open automatically around the start of airing.
2	Ampris	2013-05-19	We better get Sam the Slayer tonight and not more of Sam the Singer.
3	MsLibby	2013-05-19	We will know soon enough, but Oona Chapman's reportedly told GoT boses that she will no longer film topless scenes! Hmm.....I really hope it's because she won't be filming any scenes at all.http://www.telegraph...ess-scenes.html
4	teemo	2013-05-19	We will know soon enough, but Oona Chapman's reportedly told GoT boses that she will no longer film topless scenes! Hmm.....I really hope it's because she won't be filming any scenes at all.http://www.telegraph...ess-scenes.htmlI think that was Esme Bianco (Ros).
5	WinterKing	2013-05-19	Starting with Arya and rock.
6	DreamSongs	2013-05-19	No Jaime this episode...
7	MsLibby	2013-05-19	NO Jaime for sure??
8	Ser Joe of House Targaryen	2013-05-19	We will know soon enough, but Oona Chapman's reportedly told GoT boses that she will no longer film topless scenes! Hmm.....I really hope it's because she won't be filming any scenes at all.http://www.telegraph...ess-scenes.htmlDid you read the article? Thats not what it says at all. Oona Chaplin was gossiping about another actress on the show (I'm guessing the one who played Ros) refused to do nude scenes any more.
9	DreamSongs	2013-05-19	Open with Arya and Sandor.......
And LOL!  This so captures the truth of Sandor and Arya!
10	DreamSongs	2013-05-19	NO Jaime for sure??NCW was not in the opening credits.  Ergo, no Jaime.
11	teemo	2013-05-19	Hound sounds awkward and a lot nicer than usual.
12	MsLibby	2013-05-19	Did you read the article? Thats not what it says at all. Oona Chaplin was gossiping about another actress on the show (I'm guessing the one who played Ros) refused to do nude scenes any more.I did read it. I obviously read it wrong because I followed another think to it. Hmm....Then I wonder who it was.
13	Agamemnon	2013-05-19	red wedding this episode?
14	WinterKing	2013-05-19	Very book-like until now.

Ahh...dark warrior men with an attitude...
19	Jon-Michael Pearson	2013-05-19	So far best episodes yet, love the Hound.
20	DreamSongs	2013-05-19	I actually like  that Gendry and Stannis are meeting...I know he has taken up some of the role of Edric Storm...but since D&D have to cut corners in the big picture...I am really paying attention to where Gendry's story line is going on the show.
21	Ser Joe of House Targaryen	2013-05-19	Ooh some Targaryen history mixed in with Davos' reading lessons! /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />
22	DreamSongs	2013-05-19	Tell him DAVOS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Tell Stannis how illogical he is!!!!!!!!!!!!

26	DreamSongs	2013-05-19	Sansa, Shae and Tyrion again......
Shae...you might be better off with Podrick......
Tyrion being an absolute fool......
And encouraging poor Sansa to become an alcoholic.....
Cersei and Marge being BFFs...
Such wonderfully sarcastic bitches....
*hugs poor Sansa*
27	optimusapple	2013-05-19	I'm so glad the explained "The Rains of Castamere" before next week
28	DreamSongs	2013-05-19	*Moment of silence for Sansa*
29	WinterKing	2013-05-19	She knelt?!!!
30	ebevan91	2013-05-19	She's so damn tall LOL
31	SOSRadio	2013-05-19	Total dick move, Joff!
32	DreamSongs	2013-05-19	Nice the nod Marge gave Sansa considering the Tyrells were not invited in the book...
Ooh....the Maiden Cloak scene....
Nooooooo.......I wanted Tyrion on the fool's back!
33	Ser Joe of House Targaryen	2013-05-19	At least she knelt for him! /lol.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lol:' />

37	Ser Joe of House Targaryen	2013-05-19	Joff is a dick and evil piece of crapIt is known.
38	DreamSongs	2013-05-19	I hate that Sansa knelt as well.  Took away her wolfishness.
Oh crap...Mel is seducing Gendry  /ohmy.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':o' />
39	Minsc	2013-05-19	I cant believe they took away Sansa refusing to kneel for himWell, seeing how they have already dicked over Sansa's entire storyline this season it is not surprising they took away one of her biggest moments of strength in the books.

40	DreamSongs	2013-05-19	I can't watch....
41	WinterKing	2013-05-19	Well, I did not imagine  the leeche scene like that.
42	Warden of the North121	2013-05-19	Book purists are raging over this Gendry scene right now lol
43	DreamSongs	2013-05-19	And I thought Sansa was in trouble......
44	Bayard	2013-05-19	Well, seeing how they have already dicked over Sansa's entire storyline this season it is not surprising they took away one of her biggest moments of strength in the books.That "strength" would have damned her character forever in the eyes of non-readers. Tyrion is the perfect man in the show.
45	DreamSongs	2013-05-19	Well...now we know how effective Stannis' blood is now /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />
46	mafalda	2013-05-19	wtf am I watching? Is there an orgy going on in Dragonstone??
47	DreamSongs	2013-05-19	Poor dumb Loras.
48	teemo	2013-05-19	um....wha??? i tried to stop by myself but i had to come on here
49	Minsc	2013-05-19	That "strength" would have damned her character forever in the eyes of non-readers. Tyrion is the perfect man in the show.That is part of their dicking over Sansa's story that I was referring to, in how it is better for them to diminish a character they don't like then actually present their favorite character in an unfavorable light like he is in the books.
50	DreamSongs	2013-05-19	I give Cersei and Tywin credit for trying to stop Joff's and Tyrion's nonsense.
51	DreamSongs	2013-05-19	In the moment of Cersei and Loras, I actually like Cersei for once...
52	Jory	2013-05-19	So many feels in so many different directions
53	DreamSongs	2013-05-19	Yes Tyrion!
54	DreamSongs	2013-05-19	Drunk Tyrion, drunk lusty Joffrey, rational Tywin.

57	DreamSongs	2013-05-19	I like the nod to Jon that Tyrion gave
58	WinterKing	2013-05-19	I still hate Daario.Book Daario or Show Daario.
59	DreamSongs	2013-05-19	At least they gave Sansa back some of her power in that scene.
60	DreamSongs	2013-05-19	Not Daario again /devil.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':devil:' />
61	WinterKing	2013-05-19	BR is watching you.
62	7V3N	2013-05-19	Best episode yet. I loved every scene (including the leech scene, it kinda made sense). I also enjoy that Daario is actually charming (I never found the book version to be so). He reminds me of Gannicus from Spartacus, in some ways. LOVED the Slayer scene. I just wished we saw the puddle of icy cold water.

74	jons nissa	2013-05-19	aww. sam the slayer! but what's up with all the crows?
75	Ser_Patreck	2013-05-19	They actually made Sansa kneel.I could hear anguished wails all the way from the north hemisphere.
76	Kaiser Stormslayer	2013-05-19	We better get Sam the Slayer tonight and not more of Sam the Singer.Boom goes the dynamite!Perfect scene. Samwell The Slayer
77	Ser_Patreck	2013-05-19	aww. sam the slayer! but what's up with all the crows?Coldhands! =D
78	WrathOfTinyKittens	2013-05-19	Won't it kind of make a difference that Grenn wasn't there to see Sam kill the Other?
79	Roboginger	2013-05-19	That is part of their dicking over Sansa's story that I was referring to, in how it is better for them to diminish a character they don't like then actually present their favorite character in an unfavorable light like he is in the books.Sansa would have come as a total bitch if she refused to Kneel.
80	-Ghost-	2013-05-19	Finally Sam the Slayer!!!
81	Tom son of Tom	2013-05-19	Coldhands! =DBoom goes the dynamite!Perfect scene. Samwell The SlayerThe only thing is though, is how is show Sam "Sam the Slayer" when there was no one but Gilly to witness it?
82	Jojosh	2013-05-19	I mean I already hate Daario in the books so I guess the show improved upon that standard he's still not that good imo.
Best episode this season to me
Not sure how Sansa could possibly still be 14 when everyone else got aged up but oh well

83	mafalda	2013-05-19	GREAT episode!!!!
Sansa and Tyrion's wedding was perfect
Daario and the Second Sons were perfect
Ser Davos was perfect
Just everything! Except the weird leeching scene! That part dragged on longer than needed. Way longer. Now I see why they had Gendry grow that ridiculous goatee, so he would maybe look older when Mel rapes him /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' /> But still, as weird as that scene was, it got even weirder when Stannis and Davos came in and watched...
Disappointed to see that the Red Wedding episode will be sharing screen time with Jon...
84	teemo	2013-05-19	omg in "next time" Edmure dancing all happy at the wedding
85	mafalda	2013-05-19	And Sam! Finally!!!
86	Moseh Khayim	2013-05-19	I was totally expecting Coldhands until the scene itself. Now I'm kinda pissed.

88	Lord Elrosir	2013-05-19	This shit redeemed the season in my eyes.  So good!"Yes now the rains weep o'er his hall, and not a soul to hear."2 WEEKS!
89	Kaiser Stormslayer	2013-05-19	I still don't completley grasp why Stannis has such a hard on for Robb to name him first of the 3.I would have thought Tywin would be in there before Baylon Greyjoy. I guess I need to read the books

93	jons nissa	2013-05-19	hey, what do they mean in two weeks? are they going to skip next week because of the holiday so the ratings won't have the memorial day dip? 
so the sansanistas must be having a coronary. loved how puddles bit it. and drunk tyrion is no fun. cersei would be a nightmare for loras if that marriage ever came to be. lucky for him it will never happen.
can't wait for next week!

95	Zman1863	2013-05-19	I was totally expecting Coldhands until the scene itself. Now I'm kinda pissed.It's done as a cliffhanger in the book anyway. Its just a bit more of one.
96	Greyjoy67	2013-05-19	I was totally expecting Coldhands until the scene itself. Now I'm kinda pissed.Oh come on, he'll be in at some point. That was a fabulous scene!This episode man, so good. And Dany's arse. .Mmmmm
97	Doctor Steve Brule	2013-05-19	...dddddddddaaaaaaario!
good episode though, not much happens but its not that boring.

99	Ser Joe of House Targaryen	2013-05-19	Sansa not kneeling was one of the few things she had control of in her life at that point in time and was a strong moment for her.I see your point and its a great scene in the book, but show Sansa is just at a different place. She seemed to have more sympathy for Tyrion than in the books. To be honest, I always found it upsetting that she wasn't more kind towards Tyrion. He was never cruel to her.
100	Ser_Patreck	2013-05-19	Won't it kind of make a difference that Grenn wasn't there to see Sam kill the Other? Yep. I hated that. Sam actually built a sort of a reputation there. Now I wonder, why would the brothers listen to him at all?
101	Tom son of Tom	2013-05-19	I still don't completley grasp why Stannis has such a hard on for Robb to name him first of the 3.I would have thought Tywin would be in there before Baylon Greyjoy. I guess I need to read the booksTywin isn't a king. Balon is a king, albeit self declared. As is Robb.
102	Logodnica	2013-05-19	Sansa not kneeling was one of the few things she had control of in her life at that point in time and was a strong moment for her.I'm not sure.  They didn't show it as a "choice moment"  as in they didn't show her understanding what it meant to kneel and end the mockery.  They showed it more of a "of course I would do that momenet" where she didn't realize that he couldn't reach her, and she knelt when she realized. Maybe what they are going for is "Sansa is so kind she would of course kneel.  Love her more."  Instead of "Sansa realized what it would mean to spare Tyron's feelings, and so she knelt.  She has no malice towards him." Perhaps I'm dissecting it too much.
103	mafalda	2013-05-19	FTFY. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />Lol, well, she is my girl crush, but I'm sorry to say Daario outshadowed her. I've been waiting for him FOREVER! Yum!
104	Roboginger	2013-05-19	good Episode, not the best this season its up there though.I think If they did not have Tyrion be a decent dude to Sansa before the wedding they could have pulled off the Sansa no kneel move without her coming off as a dick.
But as it was filmed i think she would have come off as mean.
105	Colonel Green	2013-05-19	Now that the episode has aired, I can say that, in my opinion, they quite blatantly chickened out on the entire Sansa/Tyrion story.  There were obvious production reasons why it wasn't going to be exactly like the books, but essentially every creative choice they made in relation to it was aimed at sanding all the rough edges off it so that none of the major actors (apart from the show's go-to asshole, Joffrey, and I guess Tywin) would come off looking bad.  In the process, they reduced one of the most harrowing parts of the third book to a limp noodle, dramatically.To be honest, I always found it upsetting that she wasn't more kind towards Tyrion. He was never cruel to her.Tyrion was her least-cruel jailer, but he was her jailer nonetheless.

108	JonDunn	2013-05-19	I was disappointed they showed Stannis naming the three names with the leeches.  I think it's going to be obvious to the part of the audience that pays attention what it means.
oh well.
109	Nezzer	2013-05-19	omg in "next time" Edmure dancing all happy at the weddingSeriously? He dances?

111	Frumpus	2013-05-19	We will know soon enough, but Oona Chapman's reportedly told GoT boses that she will no longer film topless scenes! Hmm.....I really hope it's because she won't be filming any scenes at all.http://www.telegraph...ess-scenes.htmlWow way to not read the article. Oona Chaplin was talking about another actress on the set.Still, kind of shitty that they wrote Ros out of the show simply because she wouldn't do nudity anymore.

116	Ser_Patreck	2013-05-19	BTW, loved Dany's "What do you mean I don't speak Dothraki perfectly well?"Newsflash, Mother of Dragons: sometimes, husbands will lie to their wives so they feel better about themselves =P
117	piratesswoop	2013-05-19	I hated that scene where Tyrion came to Sansa before the wedding and got her to SMILE. But I guess D&D can't allow precious Tyrion to ever look like a bad guy /bang.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bang:' />
118	Kaiser Stormslayer	2013-05-19	Why are you in here if you havent read the books? LolI started reading the summaries to get a grasp of the story and , well, I ended reading more than I should have. I suppose Stannis' problem has to do with The Stark parley with Renly
119	Newstar	2013-05-19	Man, Gendry's not having the greatest season, is he?
I kind of figured Sansa would kneel. I also kind of figured the wedding night scene would play out more or less as it did in the books, only without physical contact and without either Sansa or Tyrion getting completely undressed.
There was something kind of funny about Sansa's smallclothes being a white tunic thing (I was reminded of Mormon undergarments) rather than the pink corset/grey skirt combo she usually wears. It was very much "Attention, Tyrion, you're about to defile an innocent, angelic virgin" costuming, heh.

121	Minsc	2013-05-19	To be honest, I always found it upsetting that she wasn't more kind towards Tyrion. He was never cruel to her.Besides you know keeping her prisoner or agreeing to make her forcibly marry him and his family.
122	teemo	2013-05-19	Seriously? He dances?

Looks like he's running or dancing or something, very jovial, surrounded by 3 or 4 girls.
123	redriver	2013-05-19	Question folks.Did Coldhands appear with the ravens?Did they attack wights?
Don't get to see the show until tomorrow.A brief description of the scene would be great,
124	tito5601	2013-05-19	nice to see sam kill the white walker and darrio was cool
125	Greyjoy67	2013-05-19	Man, Gendry's not having the greatest season, is he?I kind of figured Sansa would kneel. I also kind of figured the wedding night scene would play out more or less as it did in the books, only without physical contact and without either Sansa or Tyrion getting undressed.Yeah. When everyone's done nitpicking (as usual), I'd like to see how brilliant that whole scene was. Dinklage and Turner played it beautifully.
126	-Ghost-	2013-05-19	It was one of the best episodes this season. That's not the point. I'm starting to doubt we'll see Coldhands at all.Coldhands is confirmed. "Sam meets an older gentlemen" was one of the synopsis's
127	jobmartell	2013-05-19	Daario has become Ros. No likey.
128	Ser Joe of House Targaryen	2013-05-19	Besides you know keeping her prisoner or agreeing to make her forcibly marry him and his family.None of that was his doing. You're acting as if he was complicit in all that planning in the books. He most definitely was not.
129	Zman1863	2013-05-19	I'm not sure.  They didn't show it as a "choice moment"  as in they didn't show her understanding what it meant to kneel and end the mockery.  They showed it more of a "of course I would do that momenet" where she didn't realize that he couldn't reach her, and she knelt when she realized.Maybe what they are going for is "Sansa is so kind she would of course kneel.  Love her more."  Instead of "Sansa realized what it would mean to spare Tyron's feelings, and so she knelt.  She has no malice towards him."Perhaps I'm dissecting it too much.It's another one of those moments that is conveyed through Sansa's thoughts rather than what she says or does. It can't be done as well on the screen. At the very least, they didn't prolong the moment to portray her in a worse light.
130	Jojosh	2013-05-19	Wow way to not read the article. Oona Chaplin was talking about another actress on the set.Still, kind of shitty that they wrote Ros out of the show simply because she wouldn't do nudity anymore.Is that so?Now I kinda feel bad that they killed her off the way they didAs for the sansa not kneeling stuff that's a perfect way to make her come off as a bitch to everyone who watches the show as Joffrey is already making light of Tyrion and that would sort of mesh to seem like she's compounding the humiliation. A good choice to just ignore it Not sure what type of strength its showing

131	Tom son of Tom	2013-05-19	Seriously? He dances?

He's not dancing, but he looks extremely happy.
132	Grail King	2013-05-19	very pissed they took away Sansa's f**k u to the lannisters.
133	alexislalas	2013-05-19	It was a good way of adapting the wedding scene, but it would have been perfect if it had been a surprise for Sansa, it would have been a much better line of story.
Maybe Coldhands will be replaced by Jojen in the way that through his visions he will know where the three eyed raven is. Or Bran will know. If they are taking away other parts of the book, I see them taking Coldhands also.
134	Colonel Green	2013-05-19	None of that was his doing. You're acting as if he was complicit in all that planning in the books. He most definitely was not.He was just following orders!
135	Summerfell	2013-05-19	Coldhands is confirmed. "Sam meets an older gentlemen" was one of the synopsis'sThat was part of the synopsis for THIS episode. I also thought Coldhands was gonna be in this episode.
136	Ser Joe of House Targaryen	2013-05-19	He was just following orders!Unfortunately, yeah. It was not one of his finer moments. I think he more than makes up for it later, though. Do I wish he had the big brass (gold since he's Lannister?) to stand up to his dad way before? Sure. But, alas...
137	-Ghost-	2013-05-19	Maybe Coldhands got moved then, but why would they write that in a synopsis to begin with?

139	Minsc	2013-05-19	None of that was his doing. You're acting as if he was complicit in all that planning in the books. He most definitely was not.He had the authority to trade her for one of his cousins and he could have freely said no to Tywin.
140	Ser Joe of House Targaryen	2013-05-19	Coldhands is in. In a episode synopsis, it says "Sam meets an older gentleman." who else would that be?That was in the synopsis for THIS episode. The older gentleman was not Coldhands.

145	go joff go	2013-05-19	Great episode, especially the final scene.  I personally would have liked them to keep the kneel.  But in the show universe it would come off as unspeakably hoorible thing to do at that moment.  People never forgave book sansa for what she did and GRRM always says he never intended her to be seen in such a poor light, so I don't really have that big of a problem with it,
146	Broken Fox	2013-05-19	Melisandre is hot and all but that scene was retarded, and went on way too long.
147	Ser Joe of House Targaryen	2013-05-19	So maybe the scene got moved last minute. Why would they write that to begin with?Ask D&D. Pretty sure we got the "older gentleman", though. Doesnt mean CH doesnt show up in Ep10. Who knows?

In how, that is the only way that your case is true.Ok, this will be my last comment on this because I dont feel like getting bogged down into a lame debate where clearly neither party will change their mind.Tyrion did some things where Sansa was concerned that yes, were not in her best interests, but sometimes people just dont have the courage or the strength to make the right choices. People, even good people, have weaknesses. Clearly, where Tywin Lannister is concerned, Tyrion has some "issues". So, yes, he does have free will and he did make some bad choices, but I never believed for one instant that Tyrion had bad intentions toward Sansa, ever. Not while he was Hand, not when they married, and not on their wedding night. Tywin, Cersei, and Joff clearly did. Thats the difference between the Lannisters in the books.

156	Lord Elrosir	2013-05-19	If Sansa wouldn't kneel, it would've just insulted Tyrion and gave pleasure to other Lannisters (sans Tywin).  Stupid point to nitpick about.  Also, viewers would've hated Sansa for it, and quite frankly after next weeks episode, they'll need to cling to all the Stark love they can.
157	Outtawack311	2013-05-19	Were those birds on the weirwood near Sam a reference to Bloodraven, or was I imagining it?
158	Bastard Walder	2013-05-19	I'm certainly no book purist, but we finally got to a change that made me rage: Sansa kneeling at her wedding.  I was livid.If she didn't kneel, the audience would hate her forever. A sort of necessary evil lol

160	Ser Steven	2013-05-19	Won't it kind of make a difference that Grenn wasn't there to see Sam kill the Other?Not really all they have to do is when Sam is telling the story of how he and Gilly escaped, have Gilly jump in and say," And Sam kill an other with dragonglass!" then have Green be like "oh, Sam the slayer"
161	Bastard Walder	2013-05-19	Were those birds on the weirwood near Sam a reference to Bloodraven, or was I imagining it?One of them may have been Bloodraven, but they're the murder the crows that follow Coldhands.
162	chimere	2013-05-19	Maybe I'm remembering wrong, but Tyrion wasn't cruel to Sansa before their wedding, he even told her she could marry Lancel if she wanted and she said no. It was just a total surprise for her, she didn't want to kneel because she felt she didn't have to since it was her wedding. Also in the books, when Tyrion says they don't have to have sex until she wants to she says "what if I never want to?" in a mean way right? I think it would have been better for the viewers if she didn't kneel and later Tyrion asks why and she says "It was my wedding I shouldn't have to kneel if I don't want to," it might have made the audience feel bad for her. But I understand why they did what they did.
163	nothatso	2013-05-19	I'm wondering if they've cut out the bit about Robb's will.
164	Dio Forel	2013-05-19	I love the books.... but I am no Purist.  Purists clearly need to pay attention to the episode.  Sansa saw Joffrey,  that maniacal little prick, take the stool away from Tyrion.  She stood there fully aware the stool was taken away... knowing Tyrion couldn't reach with the cloak.... hearing the crowd laughing at Tyrion... and she kept her back turned to him.  It was only when Tyrion tugged on her like umm hey please kneel down that she actually obliged.  Then later he mentioned consummation and she breaks out the alcohol (which she only drinks when it is necessary).  Then she goes on to say what if she never wants him in her bed and watches him pass out.  Maybe she wasn't a blatant bitch about it but as far as I saw she knew very well Tyrion was being laughed at and stood her ground until he pleaded.  Relax purists!
165	Khal Pono	2013-05-19	That episode was dynamite!  I'd call it my favorite from Season 3 so far; it gets us back on track after two mediocre episodes.  Here's what I loved* Lots of choice dialogue straight from the book, especially during the wedding scene and during Dany's parley with the Second Sons.  The Stannis/Davos conversation in the cell was fairly faithful to similar conversations from the book.* Lots of clever little winks and nods (as well as a meta-conversation about winking itself); I love that Dany is struggling with the same Dothraki phrase that Irri was trying to teach her in Season 1.  Some cool foreshadowing too.  Note that after Melisandre burns the leeches they cut straight to Joffrey drinking a cup of wine.  I love it!  In the tub scene, there may also have been a bit of teasing/foreshadowing of forthcoming scenes involving Missandei "serving" Dany.* Lots of good old-fashioned GoT nudity.  How ravishing was Carice van Houten in the Gendry sex scene!  It boggles my mind that some people think she's not sexy enough to play Melisandre.  In my book, it was the hottest scene so far in the entire series.  And how beautiful was Dany rising from the tub, as a show of strength, which is a callback to Gwen Christie's scene in episode 5.  She looked fierce and incredible.  And it puts the rumors to rest that Emilia Clarke somehow takes herself too seriously to show T&A (as falsely reported in articles like this): http://www.telegraph...ess-scenes.html* Dany and Daario already have great chemistry, which is important* Mero's boorishness was over-the-top and hilarious* Sam the fucking slayer!  I will agree with those, however, who complain that it takes away from his slayer-ness that his Brothers weren't around to see the deed.  Who will believe him??  and how fucking cool were the raven and weirwood shots!  That ought to please a lot of book purists.* Even the biggest departure from the books was handled well and believably, with Melisandre reluctantly agreeing not to kill the bastard (Gendry instead of Edric) for now and just sacrificing the leeches insteadSo excited for the last two episodes!

177	Logodnica	2013-05-19	Now that the episode has aired, I can say that, in my opinion, they quite blatantly chickened out on the entire Sansa/Tyrion story.  There were obvious production reasons why it wasn't going to be exactly like the books, but essentially every creative choice they made in relation to it was aimed at sanding all the rough edges off it so that none of the major actors (apart from the show's go-to asshole, Joffrey, and I guess Tywin) would come off looking bad.  In the process, they reduced one of the most harrowing parts of the third book to a limp noodle, dramatically.Tyrion was her least-cruel jailer, but he was her jailer nonetheless.Agreed except on one point.  As she was taking off her dress, Tyron CLEARLY was looking at her with lust.  I'm glad that they at least added that wrinkle to the scene.  Tyron isn't some kind of saint.
178	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-05-19	Yes, because all the brothers of the Night's Watch would believe in a wildling girl's mad tales without batting an eye.What reason do they have to disbelieve Sam and Gilly other than it gives you an excuse to complain about something? Sure they'll be surprised and skeptical at first but ultimately Sam has no reason to make it up since he's quite honest about his cowardice and Gilly has no reason to lie whatsoever.
179	Lord Elrosir	2013-05-19	The only thing I want to nitpick over is when Cersei tells Margaery about "The Rains of Castamere".  Cersei references to seeing the corpses hang above Casterly Rock, but in the books, she was not even born yet.  House Reyne and Tarbeck were annihilated in 260AL and Jamie + Cersei were born in 266AL.

185	The Scabbard Of the Morning	2013-05-19	The writers also messed up Sansa's age. She's not 14, not in the show, she's got to be at least 16.
Remember Sansa is 4 years older than Bran, Bran was 10 (in the show) when the story started, a it's been at least 2 years since season 1 started.  Bran is 12 now and Arya is 14, Sansa should be 16.
186	TheButcherCrow	2013-05-19	Pray tell, how does one establish Sansa's motives in not kneeling without access to her thoughts? There is no way to do it that doesn't stink of bad writing. The only way I can think of to do it would be to have had a scene where Shae tells Sansa not to kneel (thus making it Shae's idea, not Sansa's) or have Sansa say to Shae, "I will not kneel for him, they have taken everything from me, they shall not have that". Either way, it kinda sucks.

198	King Zee	2013-05-19	The writers also messed up Sansa's age. She's not 14, not in the show, she's got to be at least 16.Remember Sansa is 4 years older than Bran, Bran was 10 (in the show) when the story started, a it's been at least 2 years since season 1 started.  Bran is 12 now and Arya is 14, Sansa should be 16.who says Sansa is 4 years older in the show ?in episode one she's  "not yet 13" so if 2 years have passed than she's  "not yet 15" now aka 14.
199	Khal Pono	2013-05-19	Who cares? I mean really?the poster did use the word "nitpick" which means he acknowledges he is complaining about a minor point.  nitpicking is different from going apeshit over book changes--and we see plenty of both behaviors on these boards

200	Grail King	2013-05-19	maybe she was lying so Tyrion would be more likely to keep his paws off her ;-)I was disappointed too, but get over it--it's a minor thing.  Grenn and Pyp will believe him and everyone else will call him "Slayer" ironically, which is essentially what happens in the book.This is what I thought also.
201	TheButcherCrow	2013-05-19	The writers also messed up Sansa's age. She's not 14, not in the show, she's got to be at least 16.Remember Sansa is 4 years older than Bran, Bran was 10 (in the show) when the story started, a it's been at least 2 years since season 1 started.  Bran is 12 now and Arya is 14, Sansa should be 16.I thought that too. She literally tells Cersei in episode 1 that she is 13. So if she had just turned 13 then & she is just about to turn 15 now, that would be a maximum of 1 year 11 months between the feast at Winterfell & Sansa's wedding. It's possible I suppose?
202	houseHB	2013-05-19	I loved the Sam the slayer scene. In the books Sam does not like being called Sam the Slayer so having no brothers watch him do it will make the sam the slayer joke make more sense to non book readers.
203	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-05-19	I'm aware of that. But the books didn't make him out to be a complete jackass before handI don't see what this has to do with him bring happy with his new bride. If anything it's worse in the books since he's not "a complete jackass."
204	Grail King	2013-05-19	I will most likely calm down after I see it a second or third time, I just wonder how they're going to give her wolfness back.
205	JonCon's Red Beard	2013-05-19	Agreed except on one point.  As she was taking off her dress, Tyron CLEARLY was looking at her with lust.  I'm glad that they at least added that wrinkle to the scene.  Tyron isn't some kind of saint.It was somehow implied when Bronn told him that he wanted to f her, he just didn't want to admit it.
206	Minsc	2013-05-19	That's the equivalent of me giving you $1 and then for that dollar you give me $1,000. Then me Chastising you for be an ass for not taking that dealIt is a trade of a Lannister for a Stark, and seeing how for all Tyrion knows Joffrey and Cersei had already allowed two Starks be killed maybe he should realize that is a pretty just trade in compensation for the Starks already felt loses.
207	Tom son of Tom	2013-05-19	"Come fight death with me" has to be one of the best quotes before sex ever. I may have to use that one... I would then promptly get pushed off the bed and called a weirdo.

213	Rabel Dusk	2013-05-19	Maybe I'm wrong, but it looked like Sam left the dragonglass knife behind when he and Gilly took off after killing the Walker. If so, very stupid. But Sam isn't a quick thinker.
214	teemo	2013-05-19	Yeah that sex scene was definitely too drawn out and I felt like I was watching Cinemax briefly.

215	7V3N	2013-05-19	The only thing is though, is how is show Sam "Sam the Slayer" when there was no one but Gilly to witness it?Surely Sam will return to the Wall saying "Dragonglass! It worked against the Others!" Sam is smart. He would not just forget to tell the brothers that he found out a method that actually works. He may not say he did it, but he will surely tell them that he saw an Other get killed (or whatever) by dragonglass.
216	DebL66	2013-05-19	LOLZ at the look Cersei was giving Marge when she looped her arm through hers.  Lena Headey is genius.
217	Logodnica	2013-05-19	He had the authority to trade her for one of his cousins and he could have freely said no to Tywin.Wasn't Tywin Hand by that time.  Tyron had no authority anymore.  He couldn't say no to Tywin.
218	Khal Pono	2013-05-19	Was Mel also trying to get a demon baby with Gendry or was she just distracting him to leech him?Definitely the latter, though the writers were trying to fake-out the viewers.  Mel actually wanted to kill Gendry (in lieu of Edric in this story) but Stannis talked her out of it, due to Davos's objections.  So she agrees to the "lite" version of the blood sacrifice instead.Also, the seduction is a way to get Gendry's blood to, er, rise, which presumably makes for a more potent sacrifice, if you think about it.

I don't understand this pretend higher moral ground some posters have where nudity is supposed to only be shown when its 100% necessary.
220	Ser Steven	2013-05-19	Dude. Sam is a fat coward. Gilly is a wilding. A wildling. The brothers are not usually the best of men, and they are way worse when fat cowards and wildlings are concerned. They would perceive this story as some way Sam found of earning respect, and would see Gilly's support as a wildling whore attaching himself to an incompetent brother in order to get protection.They needed witnesses. They have none. Not trustworthy ones, anyway.Why? Sam has never ever done that before. Matter of fact he has gone out of his way to tell everyone how much of a coward he is. Not to mention the people that start calling him Sam the Slayer are his friends, why would they go straight to not believing him?
221	Ser_Patreck	2013-05-19	Sam is a self confessed coward and a friend of Grenn and co, not to mention Jon. So think about whether or not they'll actually believe him. He has no reason to lie and neither does Gillly, wildling or not. You keep ignoring the fact the the Night's Watch isn't about to take a wildling on her word and that even Sam's friend's can hold a reasonable doubt about him killing an Other, a feat few know to be possible.Plus, he needs more than his friends to believe him. He needs the Watch to believe him. That's part of the pull he uses to convince the other commanders vote for Jon Snow.I have no problems with the seires changing. I'm just pointing out that this is a great change, not a tiny one, and that it kinda sucks for Sam also, since I believe his fame was a great confidence booster for him.
222	Logodnica	2013-05-19	Was Mel also trying to get a demon baby with Gendry or was she just distracting him to leech him?there was NO NEED to distract him.  It's just HBO wasting precious show minutes with sex and nudity.

224	Lady Lea	2013-05-19	If it was just about his blood I am confident Mel could have tied him up and leeched him without doing him first. She is a witch.Maybe she just thought he was a hottie and wanted to tap dat ass.
225	Grail King	2013-05-19	I don't even know what you're referring to about her wolfness.The reason for that moment in the book is to tie her into becoming ever so slowly a player than a piece, moving back into a Stark of Winterfell, they could have had her say they made me a Lannister or something to show her anger, but they didn't.They are really dumbing her down to a nobody.
226	mafalda	2013-05-19	I love the books.... but I am no Purist.  Purists clearly need to pay attention to the episode.  Sansa saw Joffrey,  that maniacal little prick, take the stool away from Tyrion.  She stood there fully aware the stool was taken away... knowing Tyrion couldn't reach with the cloak.... hearing the crowd laughing at Tyrion... and she kept her back turned to him.  It was only when Tyrion tugged on her like umm hey please kneel down that she actually obliged.  Then later he mentioned consummation and she breaks out the alcohol (which she only drinks when it is necessary).  Then she goes on to say what if she never wants him in her bed and watches him pass out.  Maybe she wasn't a blatant bitch about it but as far as I saw she knew very well Tyrion was being laughed at and stood her ground until he pleaded.  Relax purists!I am a self proclaimed book purists, but I didn't have a probelm with this at all. I agree with everything you just said. And I'm ready for them to make a separate thread about this now.The writers also messed up Sansa's age. She's not 14, not in the show, she's got to be at least 16.Remember Sansa is 4 years older than Bran, Bran was 10 (in the show) when the story started, a it's been at least 2 years since season 1 started.  Bran is 12 now and Arya is 14, Sansa should be 16.Shit, I thought she was at least 15! You mean to tell me that only a year has passed since Sansa told Cersei at Winterfell she's 13?? And I don't know if I'm right or not, but I've read that each book is a year in their time. Just something I read people, in case I'm wrong, I can feel a million people jumping to correct me now.ugh....yes....why do we need the sex if all we need is the blood for the leeches.  stupid HBOI was just discussing this with my bf. Totally unnecessary and uncomfortable to watch, especially since Genrdy is technically supposed to be a kid still. I see why they had him grow that ridiculous goatee now...
227	7V3N	2013-05-19	Wasn't Tywin Hand by that time.  Tyron had no authority anymore.  He couldn't say no to Tywin.Tywin was always Hand. Tyrion was simply there as acting Hand while Tywin was off at war.

I would much rather the show spend those minutes on something else from the book.  Perhaps given the full dialogue between Dany and the Second Sons which is a lingustic delight, and much better at developing Dany's character than the sex scene is at developing any other character.

I love to watch tv with her, but watching sex scenes with me doesn't make her uncomfortable but they seriously make me feel so.  When I say that it's like, "come on, honey, just grow up!  or leave the room."  Hah.  I remember always getting so anxious watching The Sopranos with her in high school.  Hah. Thankfully she's way behind in the show though, so we're not watching it together.

We shower nude.... we have sex nude (typically).  This is an HBO series.  ASOIAF has a lot of sexual themes in it.  I am fully with you in not understanding why people get so uptight at the end of season 3 because of nudity.  This is ASOIAF on HBO.... there are lots of non nude shows on channels like ABC Family & Nickelodeon that are available.   The Mel scene was drawn out because she made the point that she wanted to make sure he didn't suspect anything.  Clearly he didn't.

Throughout aCoK he was still loyal to his family.  Therefore it would have been totally out of character for him to do so.  Unlike Robb, Tyron is smart enough to realized that Robb could construct an alliance with a powerful family by giving his sister's hand in marriage. dhu.  so why would Tyron do something so ridiculous as trade her to the Starks??
253	wolverine	2013-05-19	Exactly, she made her point.  Any further and the audience would have hated her.  I thought it was handled well.I agree.  That scene was done very well for how the show is.  Show Tyrion is a much more beloved character than book Tyrion and Sansa's situation may be forgotten from when she used to be Joff's torture pet.  If the scene was done like the books she would seem far too bitchy.
254	Lady Lea	2013-05-19	man is it just me or was Tywin looking particularly dapper today in his leather clothes? Damn that Charles Dance is hot.
255	Dio Forel	2013-05-19	Exactly, she made her point.  Any further and the audience would have hated her.  I thought it was handled well. Same here.  It matched perfectly with the naive character with delusions of strength that Sansa is on the show.  This is Show Sansa not Book Sansa.  She IS more sympathetic.  She is NOT a bitch.  It would be a continuity issue if she ended up not kneeling as a display of contempt.

As a male... many, not so much me my girl would have my head, men tend to lose sight of reality & common sense when sex is involved.  Theon trapped with a lunatic in a dungeon when 2 random whores appear... Yeah that sounds logical.  However... the little head thinks for the big head.  Same thing for the Mel scene.  The way she made it play out I am pretty sure non-book readers saw her and thought that she was just an absolute sexual freak tying people up.  That's why it wasn't a 2 second scene.... because a lamb that is stressed & suspects what is to come winds up tainted & toxic.

265	Druze	2013-05-19	It was a good way of adapting the wedding scene, but it would have been perfect if it had been a surprise for Sansa, it would have been a much better line of story.Maybe Coldhands will be replaced by Jojen in the way that through his visions he will know where the three eyed raven is. Or Bran will know. If they are taking away other parts of the book, I see them taking Coldhands also.So you're saying Sam and Bran don't meet? How would Sam find his way under the wall without Coldhands?
266	Minsc	2013-05-19	Ha! Yeah, simply just say no to Tywin, that's precious.Yeah, wouldn't want Tyrion to suffer the pain of marrying an unattractive woman which is the only thing that Tywin threatened him with if he said no.
267	Ampris	2013-05-19	Arya and her rock <U+0080><U+0093> yay for book  loyalty. And Stranger looks promising!
By the previews I thought that the scarred man, the Titan<U+0080><U+0099>s Bastard, was Daario by the clips they showed. Instead he<U+0080><U+0099>s some longhaired Absolut Hunk wannabe who<U+0080><U+0099>s not even pretty =( Sorry, I see the fangirls are already swarming, but the way his eyes are set creeps me out. They made Drogo such a hunk, was another good looking piece of man eye candy so hard to hire?
<U+0080><U+009C>The second sons have faced worse odds and won/run<U+0080><U+009D> lol
Don<U+0080><U+0099>t like how they seem to be merging the Second Sons, Stormcrows, and especially the Golden Company though. How will that affect the storylines of Tyrion and fAegon?
<U+0080><U+009C>I<U+0080><U+0099>ll come visit you soon<U+0080><U+0080><U+009D> Yes, I bet you will Melisandre.
Love the book Davos is reading =)
One of the moments that made me really lack pity for Sansa was when she refuses to kneel for Tyrion. I am so frustrated by little things they change for no reason. How hard was it to keep that little bit true? Some people on this thread are saying that was her moment of strength. I think it<U+0080><U+0099>s her moment of pigheadedness and cruelty but to each their own.
God Gendry<U+0080><U+0099>s abs <3
That sex scene with Gendry seemed much more realistic than any they<U+0080><U+0099>ve shown so far. But leech on the cock? Damn that<U+0080><U+0099>s brutal, even for Melisandre.
<U+0080><U+009C>Your brother will become your father in law, that much is beyond dispute.<U+0080><U+009D> QoT is really only there for comic relief, she proves that week after week.
<U+0080><U+009C>I am the god of tits and wine. I shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel I visit.<U+0080><U+009D> I don<U+0080><U+0099>t know why that made me lol so hard, maybe because he was trolling Tywin, but damn!
Jack Gleeson continues to be one of the best actors on this show. I won<U+0080><U+0099>t miss his character but I<U+0080><U+0099>ll miss the actor. Maybe they should die his hair blue and make him fAegon.
Sansa is supposed to be only 14? I thought they aged everyone up, and she certainly looks at least 17.
<U+0080><U+009C>And so my watch begins<U+0080><U+009D>  - that<U+0080><U+0099>s a nice touch.
And why did they take out the whole story about not naming children? I guess they can do the Dalla-Gilly child switch still without it, assuming they actually introduce Dalla at some point. Considering how little we<U+0080><U+0099>ve seen Mance Dalla is hardly important at this point.
Sorry, but all the crows in the weirwood were fucking creepy. And <U+0080><U+009C>It<U+0080><U+0099>s come for the baby<U+0080><U+009D>? How about the Others just hunt and kill humans? However, SAM THE FUCKING SLAYER, about fucking time!
Overall, this episode automatically trumps the last few because there was no Theon torture porn.
268	Dio Forel	2013-05-19	How does that change the fact that he was willing jailor of her?  Are is okay to keep an innocent imprisoned if you think it is good for your family and thus that prisoner doesn't have a right to complain?Eh I have to be totally honest.. As far as I am concerned Tyrion has always been dedicated to his family because he is innately loyal,  reluctantly so.  He is ridiculed,  scorned... and I see an affinity with Sansa.  I do not in any way see him as her jailer.  He is intelligent & realizes what can & cannot be accomplished.  He makes the best of the situation at hand.  Tyrion is diligent,  strategic & tragic.  His entire life would be the equivalent to present-day therapy/medication methods.  I think his actions have always been admirable & respectable.  Most other people in his situation would've discussed his concerns & regrets towards Sansa after bedding her.  Tyrion didn't bed her.  The sexual deviant he is held back from his urges.  That, in itself,  speaks volumes.

270	Khal Pono	2013-05-19	okay, I started my customary Sunday night re-watch and... is Mero wearing a DEAD RAT around his neck? WTF????
I love Michelle Clapton's imagination.

Just because he does it for understandable reasons doesn't make him exempt from being a jailer.  Hell, look how much he hates Lysa for keeping him prisoner and for all he knows she believed him to be the killer of her husband thus he is a hypocrite if he believes it is okay for him to imprison an innocent for family but not Lysa.
272	BendTheKnee610	2013-05-19	Most TV viewers probably would not have seen Sansa's refusal to kneel as a sign of defiance to the Lannisters in general. They likely would have thought, "Wow, what a bitch. I hate her even more now."

275	7V3N	2013-05-19	My one big problem (I finally thought of one) with this episode, is that the mercenary group (merged) should have been called the Storm Crows to leave room for the Second Sons to enter as one hired by the slave cities and then hooking up with Tyrion. It would have at least given them the freedom to include both.

277	lostinwesteros	2013-05-19	I hate, hate, hate Mel.  Hate her from the books, to start with, but really hate this whole TV bit with Gendry.  I don't see what purpose it serves.  I like the nod to Jon that Tyrion gaveWhat was the nod to Jon?  The "Now my watch begins" bit?

278	Druze	2013-05-19	I've read up to page 9 of the comments and I'm a little suprised that the Stannis/Davos/Melisandre scenes aren't getting the credit they're due.  We finally got to see a well done scene between Davos and Stannis that shows the fantastic relationship that exists in the book.  Season 2 never captured it, the scene on the boat where he's named Hand was done quickly and stressed more why Davos is referred to as the onion knight andbwhy Stannis knighted him.  The dungeon seen tonight showed how Stannis recognizes he needs our Onion Knight's counsel.  That even after Stannis' royal pardo  Davos still threw in a jab at Melisandre with "I'll still speak against her" was icing on the cake!!!
Dragonstone for the win tonight!

284	TheMysteriousOne	2013-05-19	Two weeks?They want to avoid what happened last year because of Memorial Day (it's an American holiday) next week.
285	Silmarien	2013-05-19	I dunno if anyone else mentioned this, or if I'm just imagining it, but I'm pretty sure the Olenna scene teasing Loras about being Marg's father-in-law was her subtly trying to sway him to choose the White over marrying Cersei.  I thought the show did a great job contrasting her method of getting her (grand)children to do what she wants (have Loras take the White, but not bc Tywin ordered it, to get out of marrying Cersei), with Tywin's method of yelling at Tyrion to "do his duty" in the bedroom (which he didn't end up doing anyway).  It was subtle, but clever, IMHO.
286	mafalda	2013-05-19	what's that? American holiday?Lol, haha, yes. It is a holiday celebrating those who served in the armed forces and died.I think..
287	Khal Pono	2013-05-19	They want to avoid what happened last year because of Memorial Day (it's an American holiday) next week.Memorial Day is the unofficial beginning of summer here in the states, and it's around the time school gets out for a lot of kids.  People go out and do stuff.As stated above, ratings plunged during Season 2's most exciting episode, due to the holiday weekend.  But they're not going to allow an American holiday to disrupt the Red Wedding.

It was subtle, but clever, IMHO.Yeah I can see that. They aren't going to end up going through with the Cersei/Loras thing, so they need some way to keep people wondering while biding for time and ending up at the same place, with Cersei single and Loras in the White.
289	Ampris	2013-05-19	If it was just about his blood I am confident Mel could have tied him up and leeched him without doing him first. She is a witch.Maybe she just thought he was a hottie and wanted to tap dat ass.That would have been my thinking, if I were her. He IS a hottie.
290	Targaryen Tempest	2013-05-19	This might seem weird, but the Melisandre and Gendry is the first risque scene in this show I liked. From Dany and Drogo to Theon and friends, I never felt comfortable with any of the sex scenes. They looked hot together . . .
EDIT: I lied, Jon and Ygritte was good too.
Liked the wedding. done very well.
It doesn't seem like much happened this episode but I didn't feel bored watching it.

It was subtle, but clever, IMHO.I thought the whole work up to this was one of the best workarounds the producers have contrived so far.  Cersei or the White was a great way to develop Loras and Cersei, Tywin's relationship to his children, the iron fist he is using to keep King's Landing in check and develop Lady Olenna's character while still moving the plot forward.  I have been paying very close attention to these scenes since Willas dropped out.  They're great adaptation work and GREAT TV!Edit:  Oh, did I mention how much I loved the short scene with Cersei and Loras?  How else would an independent woman with children react to her young, naive, queer, and unwilling fiance?? /bowdown.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bowdown:' />

292	Ampris	2013-05-19	> lol the forums have already been in uproar about the Sansa scene.> as far as the Gendry scene... let's be realistic.  Those times were heavily sexually driven.  Whores & bastards galore... medieval times weren't as prude to those themes as we are now watching on TV.  Sex sells,  and apparently sex calms before leechings.Actually, sex excites before leechings! lol didn't you hear Mel's comment about how much blood he had?
293	silentwanderer	2013-05-19	I think this must have been the first time I ever saw Arya smile.
If someone would've told me 2 episodes ago the Hound was going to achieve the miracle, I would've never believed it.
And speaking of miracles, neat  little trick Melisandre used to convince Davos. Didn't work on the book, I don't see how it would work on the show.
If you ask me, Sam has done more against the terrors the night is full of than Stannis or Dany  did in this episode.

301	Mendoza	2013-05-19	Melisandre looked good tonight. Of all the characters who appear on this show, she is the most in charge of her sexuality, seriously, the stuff she was up to actually was hot, not sleazy and uncomfortable like so much other junk to pass off as adult entertainment on this show (Pod and the Whores/Littlefinger "play with her ass").

DO you need to get your blood flowing to do it? What about when they take blood for sick people? Talisa the nurse humped wounded soldiers before leeching them?Or maybe she wanted blood specifically from his junk because it was where Robert Baratheon's power resided.

310	Jasta11	2013-05-19	Great, solid episode, one of the best this season.
-I like how they Kept the Arya/Hound interaction faithfull to the book, and how they are drumming up hope for her about the wedding.
-Dany's scenes were good, I don't know how they will handle merging the sellsword companies in the long run however however. At least Show!Daario is not a ridiculous peacock like in the books, so it seems like I can take him seriously. A bit.
-Loved the Davos/Stannis scene. Finally these two get to act together, and again lifting Stannis's ''just one boy'' speech from the books was a good decision.
-While it was a pretty hot scene, the Mel/Gendry sex seems a bit... unneccesary. I guess she wanted him to be trusting, and that getting him in bed is certainly a way to do that. From her speech I imagine the ritual would have been less potent somehow if he was tied down by guards during the, err, procedure. But they could simply have gotten him in his sleep. It just seems a bit gratuitous is all.
-Yes, Sansa knelt, no it's not a travesty. It would have been hard to convey her thoughts in TV format, so it would have looked like she did it out of spite (especially after Joffrey stole the stool) and the show would have to explain it. Better to just have her kneel. Still, poor Sansa... Otherwise the scene was good; I liked Tywin silencing the snickering people with a glance. Also Cercei finally being claws out with Marg was good to see. Cercei has been a bit too nice this season, it was high time the proud lioness stand her ground again.
-The dinner/bedding scene was amazing. Olenna trolling her grandchildren, Tyrion making a hilarious fool of himself, Joffrey being shut up like the little bitch he is, Cercei shoving off Loras, Sansa gunning for the wine after Tyrion announces his, er,, duty. The Imp's look of lust turning to shame. One of the series's best. Have I mentionned Dinklage is a fantastic actor?
-Sam the Slayer! That scene only lacked Coldhands, really. I guess we'll get him next time, what with all the crows being foreshadowing. Also simply leaving the anti-White Walker superweapon lying there was not a smart move, Samwell.

311	Madfunkymonkey	2013-05-19	what's that? American holiday?Lol, haha, yes. It is a holiday celebrating those who served in the armed forces and died.I think..Yes, Memorial Day is the day we Americans honor the men and women who served in the military and died.  As a huge fan of the show and a combat veteran I am ok with HBO waiting an extra week to see the next episode.Veterans Day is in November and is very similar, its the day we honor both the living and dead men and women who served and continue to serve in the military.
312	ebevan91	2013-05-19	http://www.youtube.c...h?v=69FD2bp71E4"Show them how it feels to lose what they love."Close-up of Robb.Damn, those preview editors are awesome.For fuck's sake, people are thumbs-upping spoilers for the episode and bumping the comments to the top. This is exactly why I went ahead and read the books. I was lucky enough to only have Joffrey's death spoiled (and Jon's supposed death, which was spoiled for me on this very website. It was one of the "previews" where you see the first thread in a section on the forum's main page.).
313	Buzzard16	2013-05-19	OMG sex I'm so uncomfortable.Bravo, In ASOIAF world where adult men marry 13 year old girls, this is accepted as part of the world created. When Adult nudity is incorporated into same said world for dramatic effect on TV, it becomes unnecessary or filler. ??? There is a lot we all would like them to do differently, but they are doing the show with Hodor's junk and Mel's tits and Theon's torture porn. I for one would rather have it all, than none.
314	Ampris	2013-05-19	Why do a bunch of people think that Sansa noticed Joffrey moving the stool and thus realized Tyrion couldn't reach? As stupid as they've made showSansa, she could have been completely unaware.
315	Left Wondering Whether	2013-05-19	I. enjoyed. every. second.I notice a lot of people watch the show with their moms and complain about the sex scenes making them uncomfortable. try watching it alone. /lol.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lol:' />
316	NickTargaryen	2013-05-19	I. enjoyed. every. second.I notice a lot of people watch the show with their moms and complain about the sex scenes making them uncomfortable. try watching it alone.I kick my family out of the room for Game of Thrones. /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />
317	Oakenfist	2013-05-19	Good episode. I'm glad Cersei mentioned the meaning of Castamere to Marge. 
And did I hear correctly that Olenna mentioned Loras has a brother?
318	WiDMNDBAMMD	2013-05-19	If anyone tries to bring up "whitewashing of Cersei" I'm going to tell them to watch this episode. Threatening to kill Margaery because she called her "sister" ? Telling Loras to STFU, pointing out the Rains of Castamere?and after seeing so many freaking people comment about the Sansa thing and how she shouldn't have knelt it's ridiculous.In the books Tyrion is too proud to ask Sansa to kneel and Sansa knows the Tyrion can't reach her. In the show he does ask her to kneel. She couldn't refuse a simple request like that, it would make no freaking sense.Wow way to not read the article. Oona Chaplin was talking about another actress on the set.Still, kind of shitty that they wrote Ros out of the show simply because she wouldn't do nudity anymore.When you apply for a job don't audition for one that is called "whore"Were those birds on the weirwood near Sam a reference to Bloodraven, or was I imagining it?Possibly or they were referencing Cold Hands. They were making a lot of noise to let Sam and Gilly know that Puddles was after them.I am confused isnt  Daario Naharis with the Stormscrow and not theThe second sons. Where is Ben PlummAgain, show simplification. One sellsword army instead of two(even the size more than doubled) Storm Crows and Second Sons were 800 men a piece in the books weren't they? They're over 2,000 in the show..Brown Ben Plumm wasn't elected a leader of the Second Sons until Mero fleed, so their options are: make Ben Plumm a captain of the Second Sons now that Daario is the only person in charge.Option B is add him later as a "faction" that splits from Dany and Daario while in Mareen.Option C is have Daario take over Ben Plumm's role and betray Dany.In the book didn't the dragon glass break?Yes and no, the dragonglass killed the White Walker but it broke against a wight/armor. Killing the White Walker didn't break the dagger, it did make it extremely cold to the touch.So you're saying Sam and Bran don't meet? How would Sam find his way under the wall without Coldhands?Sam and Bran definitely do meet this season. I don't know if they'll show Coldhands this season though, Sam and Gilly might just appear on the other side of the Wall and describe him.It seems silly since Cold Hands could get played by a stunt double this season and recast, but perhaps they want to give the finale a "magical feel to it"
	Spoiler  Ellie Kendrick the actress who plays Meera Reed even spoiled something on Thronecast last week about how she went to school with the girl that plays Gilly and they have a scene together this season.Meaning Sam, Bran, Gilly, Meera and Jojen meet at the Nightfort.
Good episode. I'm glad Cersei mentioned the meaning of Castamere to Marge.And did I hear correctly that Olenna mentioned Loras has a brother?She told Margaery that her brother(Loras) will be her father in-law(since he's marrying Cersei)

319	nara	2013-05-19	I cant believe they took away Sansa refusing to kneel for himAgree, a pity, but given the changes they'd already made, this was for the best.  1) she had advance warning of the wedding, so she had time to come to terms with it. In the book, she's still in shock, so her defiance is instinctive and not petty.  2)  They had Margaery give her the talk that in the book, Garlan gave her at her wedding feast.  In both cases, they advised her to accept Tyrion and look for his good qualities.  Refusing to kneel after that conversation would have just been mean.
320	Hrafnsmerki	2013-05-20	Can someone tell me what was the point of Sam the Slayer without any brother of the Night's Watch to see it happening? Was it pure pandering?
We will never know.
321	Jon Icefyre	2013-05-20	Wow Mel was on absolute fire tonight!  Love how they totally gave her a 'Basic Instinct' momet, and to be honest as hot as she was tonight, that might actually be worth dying for!  Haha jk but really........Best quote of the episode belongs to Tyrion:Tyrion: I won't bed you until you want me to.Sansa: What if I never what you to?Tyrion: And now my watch begins.....Hahaha hilariously epic!Btw in the next episode they better show the scene where Robb tells Cat he's naming Jon his heir in his will, I'm really getting the sense that they're not gonna have that scene on the show, which IMO would be total bullshit, because it's a scene that shows a very realistic and reasonable explanation of why Cat has a problem with Jon Snow in terms of her worry about her children's inheritance that she backs up with historical precedence/facts aka the Blackyre rebellion.

322	Ampris	2013-05-20	Good episode. I'm glad Cersei mentioned the meaning of Castamere to Marge.And did I hear correctly that Olenna mentioned Loras has a brother?No, she was talking to Margaery.
323	BurningCandle	2013-05-20	Agreed except on one point.  As she was taking off her dress, Tyron CLEARLY was looking at her with lust.  I'm glad that they at least added that wrinkle to the scene.  Tyron isn't some kind of saint.In the books, does Sansa look like a woman like she does in the show? I can't remember, but I know she's supposed to only be like 12. In the show she could easily be 18 or 20.
324	eumaies	2013-05-20	Some people are comfortable watching sex scenes because the idea of two people having sex or being nude doesn't frighten the altar boy in us. I don't understand this pretend higher moral ground some posters have where nudity is supposed to only be shown when its 100% necessary.  you know it's really not that.  I actually liked this sex scene with Melisandre because it was sexy and given some kind of plot and character development pretense that meant the characters weren't completely just showing gratuitious and poorly staged sex for an hbo executives twisted guess that people want to see bad porn.  i'd like to see even better sex scenes that show people behaving in a sexy but also slightly realistic or believable manner.  But when people complain about most of the sex scenes in GOT it's pretty much because they suck.  Gimme something real, not bad porn.
325	Rockroi	2013-05-20	I thought that from a visual standpoint, this was a truly beautiful episode. From the Hound and Arya in the fields to the ravens in the god<U+0080><U+0099>s wood, to the entire wedding scene, there was something incredible about how everything looked.Other than that<U+0080>. What I liked:-The wedding was exceptionally well done, and I especially enjoyed how Tyrion<U+0080><U+0099>s drunken behavior afterwards just accentuated how sad and horrible anyone<U+0080><U+0099>s life can get.  While everyone was yoking it up and while Tywin was holding the whole mess together, Tyrion<U+0080><U+0099>s complete collapse was perfect to accent how absurd it all was.  As far as Sansa <U+0080><U+009C>kneeling<U+0080><U+009D>; it<U+0080><U+0099>s a different set-up.  In the book, Sansa is utterly blind-sided by the wedding and her lack of kneeling is her ONE act of defiance in the face of this horrible action done to her.  In the show- Sansa has had a GREAT deal of time to think this all over and any protest would be done to the ONE person who is acting graceful towards her <U+0080><U+0093> Tyrion.  In the book, Tyrion is silent to the whole thing; he has no chance to be decent.  Here, he does and I think Sansa does not want to be a petty jerk to him because he is much shorter than she.  (and in the show the absurdity of their heights is pronounced.   Seriously, Turner is REALLY tall).  -I liked a lot of Stannis and Davos<U+0080><U+0099> interplay, most notably that Stannis grieves for Davos<U+0080><U+0099> loss and that Stannis is apparently torn by what is being done to Gendry, a boy he does not even know.   I especially liked how Davos explains, at long last, why it was fine to kill Renly (traitor) but not okay to kill Gendry.  I thought it all was crafted very well.  -Dany<U+0080><U+0099>s entire story-line was good specifically because it was so minimal and understated.  Unlike last season where we got bogged down in Auarth and its empty, uninspired and vacant politics, Yukai is a battle of wits and Dany was able to pull one over on the Second-Sons specifically because she played the middle against the two ends.  I thought that scene had the danger of becoming slow and meandering, but instead it was perfectly fine.  -Joff: Still a fucking prick.What I did not like:-Mel<U+0080><U+0099>s work here had the <U+0080><U+009C>worst of both worlds<U+0080><U+009D> effect in that she said she was going to be subtle with Gendry saying he never will see the blade<U+0080> and then she shows him the <U+0080><U+009C>blade<U+0080><U+009D> (in the form of leeches) AND it needlessly makes Stannis out to be a HUGE asshole and for no reason.  In the books, its his own blood, but now it<U+0080><U+0099>s Gendry<U+0080><U+0099>s and for no really good reason.  Why do we need another reason to dislike Stannis?  -And so, next week will be amazing because <U+0080> ah<U+0080> because<U+0080> wait, what happens again next week?  This problem could have been avoided had we, you know, thought about Robb Stark this week and not, I don<U+0080><U+0099>t know, locked him away some place.  Caring about Robb makes<U+0080>. The NEXT episode all the more emotional.  But at this rate we may give a shit more if Shae was killed at the wedding; fuck- she<U+0080><U+0099>s in the show more than Robb.  -Speaking of horrible, poorly acted characters.  And so ANOTHER WEEK of terrible, uninteresting Shae making mean faces at Tyrion and Tyrion being a wuss and making sad faces back.  Why the fuck do I care about Shae? Why does she not get this?  Why is she offended by this?  Why are we subjected to it!  Holy FUCK!  You are a prostitute!  I would LOVE IT if JUST ONCE in THREE FUCKING SEASONS you acted like it!  Just once!  One time, here me; I<U+0080><U+0099>m using my <U+0080><U+009C>one time<U+0080><U+009D> just for you, your terrible accent and your terrible dialog and long stares.   That was time we could have spent with Robb.  But no- we spent it looking at Shae look at Tyrion looking at Shae looking at clean bed sheets.  -And if you are going to make Cersei horrible, does it have to be so open and obvious?  Really?  And so next week is the best episode of the season, we think.  I think they have taken the last three weeks off;  the last two have not been <U+0080><U+009C>bad<U+0080><U+009D> but uneven.  This episode was better than last week<U+0080><U+0099>s, which was better than the week<U+0080><U+0099>s before.  But the lack of consistency is noticeable.  Again.
326	Lady Lea	2013-05-20	In the books, does Sansa look like a woman like she does in the show? I can't remember, but I know she's supposed to only be like 12. In the show she could easily be 18 or 20.uh, kinda. She's 12 but is really tall and has boobs already and is starting to look like a woman. She gets looks from a lot of guys because Cersei won't give her new dresses and the old ones are really tight. The Hound comments on her changing appearance also.
327	Jabronius Maximus	2013-05-20	Man, any scene with Melisandre in a candle lit room is great.
328	As high as honor	2013-05-20	Even though there have been some changes with regards to Gendry, I really enjoyed the way they handled the leech scene. Best episode thus far.
329	sillent	2013-05-20	Naked Mel > naked Ros just saying.
Pretty good episode. Was it me or was Cersei just talking about Castamere a bit odd? It didn't seem to necessarily fit -- kinda like they just put it in there to setup for next episode. Oh well. 
I think the best part about this episode was the pacing. No scene felt rushed and the transitions were just smooth and natural. I really wish they do this in future episodes. Deal with only half the characters but give them a proper sub-arc instead of just giving each person 2minutes token time on screen.
Also, HOW GOOD WAS IT TO NOT HAVE THEON THIS EPISODE!!!!!!
330	Jon Icefyre	2013-05-20	Also, HOW GOOD WAS IT TO NOT HAVE THEON THIS EPISODE!!!!!!I know right?!?  Theon's scenes this season are literally the worst.....
331	Hrafnsmerki	2013-05-20	Naked Mel > naked Ros just saying."WELL, I DISAGREE." He said, while choking a bitch. "AND GOOD NIGHT". But yeah, I'm thankful for a whole episode without Theon. By the way, I can't wait for the "reveal" of where he is. It's so freaking obvious it's painful.Oh, and on he subject of Cersei, I don't think they made her horrible, they just made her bland and boring. A completely passive character with nothing to add. It's that or, as with Jon Snow, the actress is doing an atrocious job.

332	Arrogant Bastard	2013-05-20	Having no Theon certainly helped; hope he's done for the season though I highly doubt it.
In the books, were the leeches using Stannis' blood or Edric's? I thought it was Edric but I really don't recall.
333	~ZombieWife~	2013-05-20	If anyone tries to bring up "whitewashing of Cersei" .....People bringing up "whitewashing" in general (on a regular basis) are good at one thing: eliciting eyerolls. Everyone has their talents.
334	LordBloodraven	2013-05-20	They made Sansa kneel, WTF.
Enough Tyrion whitewashing already. He's very different from the one of the books
335	All_Men_Must_Poop	2013-05-20	Sorry, I only made it through the first eleven pages, so my apologizes if this has already been pointed out:Melisanre told Stannis it is best to slaughter before the prey recognizes terror (obviously paraphrasing).Then why in seven hells would she "agree to a demonstration" while her "prey" is sharting all over himself?However, I loved  this episode as whole.  Maybe just the comparison to the chamber-pot material GRRM gave us last week makes this one look better.*fingers crossed* for next week to hold up it's end of the bargain.
336	7V3N	2013-05-20	Having no Theon certainly helped; hope he's done for the season though I highly doubt it.In the books, were the leeches using Stannis' blood or Edric's? I thought it was Edric but I really don't recall.IIRC the leeches were Stannis and Edric was set up to be burned while Stannis was idle (since Blackwater).
337	TheButcherCrow	2013-05-20	People bringing up "whitewashing" in general (on a regular basis) are good at one thing: eliciting eyerolls. Everyone has their talents.Like dammit!! LIKE!!! The above is made all the funnier by the post that directly follows it:They made Sansa kneel, WTF.Enough Tyrion whitewashing already. He's very different from the one of the booksI do not judge. Funny is funny.

338	Words of Winter	2013-05-20	what's that? American holiday? It is an American Holiday where we honor the fallen soldiers.  It has also become the unofficial start to summer in the US.  As such it is a 3 day weekend for most people and people travel, go to the beach, bar-b-que, etc while others remember those who have died in service to the country.  As a practical matter, S2 Ep9, Blackwater, had the lowest ratings last year, even though it was one of the best because it was on memorial day weekend.  Thus they are taking a 1 week hiatus.
339	Honey Badger	2013-05-20	Episode was very cool:
- Carice Van Houten as Mel is great.  I liked the whole scene.  I wasn't sure if they really were going to deviate and just kill off Gendry versus using leeches, so I felt some tension.  She should have used a blindfold however to reduce his fear.  For anyone who is interested in the actress, she was incredible in Black Book.
- Dany and Daario scenes were awesome.  It hit the major plot points of how he came into her service.  Now let's see if their future scenes are as fucking annoying as the chapters in the books.  Dany is supposed to get emo and start spending way too much time in Mereen. 
- Sam the Slayer, recognize.  I liked how the wight ignored him like an insect.  Big mistake.  The crows swarming could be Bloodraven keeping watching or Stonehands.  Who knows. 
- No Theon.  His torture scenes were starting to get annoying.  It's great they're taking a break for a while.  Maybe when we see them again, we'll get more story and talking instead of torture.
340	Tyrion_the_Oneironaut	2013-05-20	Can someone tell me what was the point of Sam the Slayer without any brother of the Night's Watch to see it happening? Was it pure pandering?We will never know.So he can find out how to kill the Others. 'Sam the Slayer' does nothing for his character development. Nothing.
341	silentwanderer	2013-05-20	No, she was talking to Margaery.Your brother will be your father-in-law without a question, or something along those lines.They spent half the dinner talking about how Margaery's children would be her brothers's grandchildern as well as nieces and nephews. And Loras's children being Margaery's brothers and sisters in law (as well as her nieces and nephews).

342	PhoenixFlame	2013-05-20	I think the choice regarding Sansa kneeling was handled fine. She had to notice Joffers taking away the stool. She was subtle about not meekly falling in line--as in, Tyrion had to ask her. But there's a difference between showing some passive defiance and being cruel. She was smart enough to look a little "Oh, me? Sorry didn't realize." It reminded me of the musical Elisabeth; the title character gets what she wants by cold-shouldering her husband until he talks to her as an equal and compromises on certain things. I liked a S1 callback -- Tyrion tells her he'll never hurt her. That's what Joff said. No duh she doesn't trust him. It dovetailed nicely into her "What if I never want you?" She wasn't being callous, she was challenging him, as in "Will you actually keep your word?" Sure she doesn't want to boff him, but I thought it was more nuanced than that. LOL I need to get a GIF of Tywin's expression when she walks down the aisle. The going-to-hell part of me was captioning it "Damn, I shouldn't have given her to Tyrion."I loved Arya and the Hound's scene. The Hound sounded so adorable. "Where do you think I'm taking you?" That was twenty kinds of cute. I wonder if we're going to get Burrito Arya, when he wraps her up to keep her from escaping. Oh, and Stranger was perfectly cast physique wise. He's not a heavy destrier type at all. Davos reading a children's book was so cute too. And they did their scene sooo well. I loved the way he delivered "You could've come to me yesterday or tomorrow, this is why you came today."
343	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2013-05-20	was Cersei wearing the same dress that Marge was wearing in the camp scenes in season two? they looked a lot alike.
344	Honey Badger	2013-05-20	I. enjoyed. every. second.I notice a lot of people watch the show with their moms and complain about the sex scenes making them uncomfortable. try watching it alone.I've been noticing this too.  It's the strangest complaint in the world.  D&D shouldn't have to accommodate the "I watch blood letting and mayhem with my mother, and that's okay, but we're not comfortable with our sexuality, so please stop showing it" demographic.  I know we're all nerds and all, but Jesus Christ people.  Don't lay your weird hang ups and insecurities at HBO's doorstep.  The double standard and hypocrisy is absurd.  GRRM himself has complained about readers who dislike the sex but somehow ignore the violence.
345	rohit39	2013-05-20	lol well it goes by SO fast...I had to try pausing like a dozen times to get it.  Looks like he's running or dancing or something, very jovial, surrounded by 3 or 4 girls. That must be the bedding. Remember that Edmure was pleasantly surprised at how wonderful his bride to be looked. And they were already quite in love (or Edmure atleast was) right between RW unfolded.
346	Turin Turambar	2013-05-20	What I liked:the Hound-Arya dialogueDaario castingthe wedding scene (amazing acting from Peter Dinklage)Sam the Slayer (finally)Davos struggling to read Targaryen namesStannis meeting GendryStanni's interaction with DavosWhat I didn't like:Cersei bitter and unsubtle exchange with Margaerythe fact that Daario sneaked up so easily on Dany
347	Joey Beers	2013-05-20	Some people are comfortable watching sex scenes because the idea of two people having sex or being nude doesn't frighten the altar boy in us. I don't understand this pretend higher moral ground some posters have where nudity is supposed to only be shown when its 100% necessary.I have no problem with nudity on screen or in life, as long as I find the subjects attractive /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' /> Yet, I understand the complaint that instead of telling the story we have come to know, at times the show blocks segments seemingly just to have sex scenes. When parts of the story go untold simply to show some boob, it plays as juvenile. Again, I would have no problem with those type of scenes if story wasn't sacrificed for its existence.
348	Rashtibram	2013-05-20	We are all born nude you know... We shower nude.... we have sex nude (typically).  This is an HBO series.  ASOIAF has a lot of sexual themes in it.  I am fully with you in not understanding why people get so uptight at the end of season 3 because of nudity.  This is ASOIAF on HBO.... there are lots of non nude shows on channels like ABC Family & Nickelodeon that are available.  The Mel scene was drawn out because she made the point that she wanted to make sure he didn't suspect anything.  Clearly he didn't.I'm not 'uncomfortable' with it, I think sex and nudity is fine on screen. The complaints about sex typically aren't about how inappropriate the sex was, they're about how you shouldn't just fill a show with sex that doesn't serve the plot. If a sex scene is completely unnecessary, I would prefer it to be replaced by something that actually advances the plot or comes from the books.
349	PhoenixFlame	2013-05-20	Ehee, adorable Edmure. Though in context of the rest of the scene it reminds me a bit of Interview with the Vampire when they're dragging Louis and Claudia through the catacombs.
350	rmholt	2013-05-20	Nice the nod Marge gave Sansa considering the Tyrells were not invited in the book...Ooh....the Maiden Cloak scene....Nooooooo.......I wanted Tyrion on the fool's back!They werent at the breakfast but they were at the wedding
351	rmholt	2013-05-20	I know right?!?  Theon's scenes this season are literally the worst.....Not a surprise.  I thought last week they pretty much had done all the torture room torture they needed to do.  Now on to his other tasks.
352	Jon Icefyre	2013-05-20	What I liked:Daario castingAgreed, the Daario casting was exceptional!
353	rohit39	2013-05-20	Ok, this will be my last comment on this because I dont feel like getting bogged down into a lame debate where clearly neither party will change their mind.Tyrion did some things where Sansa was concerned that yes, were not in her best interests, but sometimes people just dont have the courage or the strength to make the right choices. People, even good people, have weaknesses. Clearly, where Tywin Lannister is concerned, Tyrion has some "issues". So, yes, he does have free will and he did make some bad choices, but I never believed for one instant that Tyrion had bad intentions toward Sansa, ever. Not while he was Hand, not when they married, and not on their wedding night. Tywin, Cersei, and Joff clearly did. Thats the difference between the Lannisters in the books. For me.Fin /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />Just to clarify, if you re-read Tyrions chapters from ASOS, there are numerous occasions where his inner monologue thinks that marrying Sansa would be a good thing for him because she's "comely" and in time, hopefully, would make him Lord of Winterfell, and his heir, future Lord. Tyrion has always had ambition, and lust, both of which appealed to him to be ok with the Sansa wedding. While i agree he did not have much of a choice, and protesting to Tywin might have been impossible, i doubt Tyrion would have chosen otherwise anyway.
354	rmholt	2013-05-20	What I did not like:-Mel<U+0080><U+0099>s work here had the <U+0080><U+009C>worst of both worlds<U+0080><U+009D> effect in that she said she was going to be subtle with Gendry saying he never will see the blade<U+0080> and then she shows him the <U+0080><U+009C>blade<U+0080><U+009D> (in the form of leeches) AND it needlessly makes Stannis out to be a HUGE asshole and for no reason.  In the books, its his own blood, but now it<U+0080><U+0099>s Gendry<U+0080><U+0099>s and for no really good reason.  Why do we need another reason to dislike Stannis?  Again.Not sure what this means. Mel did Edric with leeches before and did want to kill him.  Not Stannis' blood. Remember he was being leeched for some malady?
355	rmholt	2013-05-20	I don't like Cersei, but her Rains speech to "innocent" Marg was greatYeah and she let Margaery haul her around until she finished then bounced her.
356	rmholt	2013-05-20	> lol the forums have already been in uproar about the Sansa scene.> as far as the Gendry scene... let's be realistic.  Those times were heavily sexually driven.  Whores & bastards galore... medieval times weren't as prude to those themes as we are now watching on TV.  Sex sells,  and apparently sex calms before leechings.I think she wants him to make more Smoke Monster babies - or I thought so - right up until the leech on his d*ck.  Now he's just lustful and terrified.  Interesting combination.
357	Nymeria_Snow	2013-05-20	I was sad how much they changed the Sansa/Tyrion wedding from the book. The initial impact came from the fact Sansa found out just as she was getting dressed by Cersei's maids so she was in shock and had to go to the sept straight away.
And what was wrong with Tyrion's line- "that's why they have whores for men like me" (or a line somewhat like that)? Would it have hurt to have just kept that line in?

358	the hound of sansa	2013-05-20	am i the only one that didn't like so much the Sam the Slayer scene? i thought it was a bit anticlimatic. i didn't feel the horror the dread that they must have felt
359	Master Forel's Fro	2013-05-20	I don't like marg or cercei but that scene was freaking awesome, sly marg thinking she's talking to naive sansa then *burn* the look on her face was priceless.
360	jhodes	2013-05-20	I don't like marg or cercei but that scene was freaking awesome, sly marg thinking she's talking to naive sansa then *burn* the look on her face was priceless.For me, it was the opposite. In the books, I feel like Cersei would never threat anyone openly(unless inferiors) like the way she did. She can be mean and egocentric but don't forget she is also intelligent and intuitive. A threat like that ("If you ever call me sister again I will have you strangled in your sleep") don't fit Cersei`s Character.
361	Jorah the Explorer	2013-05-20	So, which leech-in-the-fire was the one with cock blood?  I'm guessing it was Robb's, seeing as how TV Robb's thinking with his other head is his own undoing.
362	jhodes	2013-05-20	I liked this episode, specially because there were too many weak episodes in this season so I'm being condescending. However, I'm not entirely satisfact. Too many adaptations and things non-related or unreal to the books are pissing me off.
About this episode:
1- We can comprehend Robert's bastard adaptation to screen, but why Melisandre needs his penis inside her? Just to tide him up in the bed?
2- In books, Cersei would never scold/theat Margaery so openly. The same goes to Tyrion, with his openly transgression against the king.
3- What kind of lame wedding was that? If I'm not sure, in the books it was a fine wedding, even so they were struggling on getting the king`s wedding much beautiful and memorable, in order to forget Tyrion`s.
4- The Tyrion`s whore bothers me A LOT. Now, we will have Tyrion`s motivation to kill his father and the whore just because she WAS JEALOUS OF HIM? She is a prostitute, and this is what whores do, period! Just stick with the book! This may have been the worst decision of the producers. Not wise at all.
5- The actor who plays Sam is very good. The scene (which I was expecting Coldhands) however wasn't good enough. Not enough drama with the couple and the baby nor scary, with the later sequence.
All in all, we can't expect just the "greater stuff" in episodes 9 and 10, so we can give it a 10/10 and forgive episodes that didn't bring us any excitement.

367	Chalkius Stark	2013-05-20	I've been noticing this too.  It's the strangest complaint in the world.  D&D shouldn't have to accommodate the "I watch blood letting and mayhem with my mother, and that's okay, but we're not comfortable with our sexuality, so please stop showing it" demographic.  I know we're all nerds and all, but Jesus Christ people.  Don't lay your weird hang ups and insecurities at HBO's doorstep.  The double standard and hypocrisy is absurd.  GRRM himself has complained about readers who dislike the sex but somehow ignore the violence.I get what you're saying, but I think the complaint for a lot of people is more that a lot of the nude scenes are put in there purely to show boob, and don't serve the plot, or don't do anything to establish a character. It doesn't offend me or bother me, I tend to watch it either alone or with mates who don't care much either, but it seems pointless at times.I mean, there's a number of scenes I didn't have a problem with with sexual content. A lot of Dany's first season ones for example. But there's plenty that just seemed gratuitous. It'd be the same with violence if I thought they were overdoing it, but I don't think they are. The nudity they've just added for the sake of adding it. I mean, the Mel/Gendry scene....there was no reason for Mel to be naked there surely, they didn't need to start having sex to get leeches on him and have him tied up. Was done to titillate, not to tell the story. Worst example for me though was the brothel scene at the end of the first episode of the 2nd series, where there's a very loud moan just as the scene is cut to....very jarring, and the scene didn't need it.
368	cade	2013-05-20	As others mentioned, I loved the pacing of this episode, how they mainly just focused on a few story lines and really let them breathe. Wish most of the episodes stuck to that format. And no Ramsay/Theon is always a plus for me.
369	Ran	2013-05-20	The thing is, we know for sure they add nudity for the sake of nudity, because Neil Marshall provided an anecdote of being outright told by an executive producer that he wanted as much nudity as possible in the brothel scene in "Blackwater". That's the attitude people are complaining about, and scenes that appear to be the result of that attitude.
370	Mladen	2013-05-20	The thing is, we know for sure they add nudity for the sake of nudity, because Neil Marshall provided an anecdote of being outright told by an executive producer that he wanted as much nudity as possible in the brothel scene in "Blackwater". That's the attitude people are complaining about, and scenes that appear to be the result of that attitude.So, basically, they don`t care about story telling as much as they care for showing nude bodies? Should I start how many things are wrong about it?Well, intelectual and artistic integrity of the producers is very questionable at this point.
371	Master Forel's Fro	2013-05-20	All the old interviews of D&D talking about expecting people to be smart enought to get the show and not dumb it down, it seems they are going about this the wrong way, is this HBO version of light porn? Because they could have fit in a lot more of the story if they cut down even a little the sex and nudity, this being the only instance of ppl complaining about sex scenes just goes to show ppl will take good story telling over cheap sex scenes.

375	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2013-05-20	Why is everybody more disturbed by the nudity than THE GODDAMN LEECH ON GENDRY'S PENIS?somehow don't think that was the sucking that gendry had in mind.
376	Tony Soprano	2013-05-20	What I liked most this episode was Dragonstone. In the previous episodes, I thought they were killing Stannis' character, but this more than made up for it. I think it redeemed him in the eyes of the viewers, and I'm glad they don't portray him as a villain who doesn't care for anything anymore. He freed Davos because he knew killing Gendry was wrong. That's why he needs Davos by his side - to be his voice of reason. somehow don't think that was the sucking that gendry had in mind. /lmao.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lmao:' />

380	TheButcherCrow	2013-05-20	Why is everybody more disturbed by the nudity than THE GODDAMN LEECH ON GENDRY'S PENIS?Can't speak to the nudity (I'm generally in favour) but a good leeching is hardly disturbing. Throughout the history of time 17 bazillion men have had a leech stuck to their cocks, it's hardly life threatening  or in fact that sore. Spare a thought for poor Theon, what he wouldn't give right now to have a leech attached to his knob. Well, truth be told there may very well be a leech attached to his cock but the point is that Theon wouldn't know if there were and that's just wrong.
381	DebL66	2013-05-20	Right??? her "Bitch please" face was priceless.That's exactly what her face looked like!  Hilarious!
382	MarieAntoinette	2013-05-20	Overall I quite liked this episode. The scenes in Kings Landing were great, I liked that there were some humorous scenes to contrast with the tragedy of the Red Wedding next week. I was pleasantly surprised by the appearance of show Daario as I did not care for this characters in the book at all. Also I really loved the scene between Stannis and Davos, I'm glad that they got some more screentime together. Lack of Theon was a good thing to me, I'm tired of the torture scenes anyway. I'm disappointed that Robb and Cat were absent I felt that they were featured way too little this season, that especially goes for Cat.
383	A Man Is A Man	2013-05-20	Gendry's genitry was sucked like it was never sucked before!!!
Butt seriously, this episode was pretty good, I just wish they had given more screen time to Robb and Cat this season, when the RW hits next episode, it's really not going to have the earth-shattering significance it should to the non-book-readers. Basically, if they could have replaced all the needless Theon torture scenes (that were never even in the book) with more Robb/Cat, we would be in good shape. But alas, no.

384	Xasthur	2013-05-20	Good episode overall, I liked the camera angles and the staging of the Wedding. If they already used so much extras for Tyrion's wedding I believe RW and PW will be visually impressive.
Not much jumping arround, I don't mind when we don't see every character in every episode, so everybody has long scenes without a cut. In The Walking Dead they had complete episodes only about Andrea and Michonne and even though the story development was kinda slow, I prefered it this way.
Sansa kneel - well, Sansa is already getting all the hate because she discriminates dwarfs so they have to make her kneel.
The sex talk has to stop. In every added scene they do it. When Mel used "dried-up-cunts" - she is a priestess after all. This is a line I expect from Cersei or the Hound...
I don't think it hurts if you have leeches on your penis by the way, but maybe these were cursed leeches or something, or something like the mutant leeches Khan uses in Star Trek II.
The ending was weird - like, just, badly edited. The cut from Sam to the credits was clumsy and the music wasn't really playing ...
But I have to say one thing: PETER DINKLAGE WAS NAILING IT TONIGHT. Holy shit, you can see he studied drama in London...

386	Demandred	2013-05-20	I enjoyed it a lot. It felt like it went by pretty quickly. It's going to be a looooong two weeks.
387	The Fourth Head	2013-05-20	since season 2, I've been buzzing on the amazing music written for the Others- so where was it? That Sam scene was excellent- but it could have been mind-bendingly terrifying had the Other been approaching to the accompaniment of that dread-music- just as they did when he approached at the end of season 2. they had a few screeches, but that was about it.
On the whole, that episode lacked music to drive it on. It was well written and crafted, but I wasn't emotionally on board. A noisy musical wedding would have contrasted well with the glum moods of Tyrion, Sansa, Cercei, Margary, Loras, Tywin, but it was lost in the background making for a more sedate affair.
388	Master Forel's Fro	2013-05-20	Where is grenn or edd now no one will believe Sam the Slayer.
389	Syphon the Sanitator	2013-05-20	Coldhands! =DNo, the ravens weren't sent by Coldhands. It's all Bryden Rivers / Bloodraven orchestrating the whole thing.Wow way to not read the article. Oona Chaplin was talking about another actress on the set.Still, kind of shitty that they wrote Ros out of the show simply because she wouldn't do nudity anymore.Comes with the territory. Ros is a whore, what else is she going to do?He was just following orders!I know some other people who said that...Ask D&D. Pretty sure we got the "older gentleman", though. Doesnt mean CH doesnt show up in Ep10. Who knows?Older Gentleman was indeed, and obviously, the Other. FFS. How is this not clear?!Were those birds on the weirwood near Sam a reference to Bloodraven, or was I imagining it?Yep. Bloodraven sent them to warm Sam.I. enjoyed. every. second.I notice a lot of people watch the show with their moms and complain about the sex scenes making them uncomfortable. try watching it alone.My mom came in just as Dany was getting out of her bath tub. /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />Yeah that sex scene was definitely too drawn out and I felt like I was watching Cinemax briefly.Wow, prude much? You must be American...I am confused isnt  Daario Naharis with the Stormscrow and not theThe second sons. Where is Ben PlummNo Plumm, no Stormcrows.I've been noticing this too.  It's the strangest complaint in the world.  D&D shouldn't have to accommodate the "I watch blood letting and mayhem with my mother, and that's okay, but we're not comfortable with our sexuality, so please stop showing it" demographic.

GRRM himself has complained about readers who dislike the sex but somehow ignore the violence.I agree. Then again, that's a very American way to think. "Violence is totally ok but ERMAGERD A NIPPLE?! SUE THE BASTARDS!"As a guy who hasnt read any of the books  i have to say it was good episode , cant wait for the finaleI have to ask... what are you doing in the book spoiler part of the episode's discussion then? I mean, all you're doing now is making wrong assumptions, making yourself look silly in a place where people assume you've read the books.And just because I can, I want to point out that there's a use to Melisandre riding Gendry.Not to "get his blood going" or whatever. And not because of the nudity quota, either.It's because if Melisandre gets pregnant from Gendry, that means another shadowbabyassassin. Why is everybody forgetting this?! She uses his blood AND his seed.

391	JackinAcar	2013-05-20	um....wha??? i tried to stop by myself but i had to come on hereThat's what Gendry said.

It's clearly marked book spoilers!Liked the episode, the nudity doesn't bother me as much as some of the sex talk. The Titans bastard really let it fly, holy crap! IDK, I just had a hard time believing a Khaleesi would sit back and be disrespected like that. I know it shows she has restraint but still. And why would they meet the three best swordsman from a company of sellswords and not have the dragons there for protection? She could have easily been killed.Poor Arya, she actually seemed happy, for the first time since season 1, after hearing where they were going.Sansa/Tyrion wedding, eh, okSam the Slayer, just fine, nice to see him not be a coward.
393	SerMixalot	2013-05-20	Stormcrows and Second Sons were merged.  I doubt we'll ever seen Ben Plumm.But dont the 2nd sons go on to support Young Aegon/Griff?  They are he Blackfyre group, nay? what will they be doing up in Mereene when they should be near Volantis?

395	mcb	2013-05-20	2- In books, Cersei would never scold/theat Margaery so openly. The same goes to Tyrion, with his openly transgression against the king.But that's what Tyrion did. Several times (and yes, he did threaten to cut off Joff's dick during the wedding). Which finally bit him on the ass during his trial.3- What kind of lame wedding was that? If I'm not sure, in the books it was a fine wedding, even so they were struggling on getting the king`s wedding much beautiful and memorable, in order to forget Tyrion`s.Really? My recollection is that it was a rapidly prepared and executed ceremony, with only a handful of guests present. Joffrey's wedding was extravagant not to overshadow Tyrion's nuptial, but simply because that's how a king's wedding is supposed to be.So, basically, they don`t care about story telling as much as they care for showing nude bodies? Should I start how many things are wrong about it?Come on, that's a gross oversimplification. If they cared about T&A only, they could make that kind of a show much, much cheaper. You don't need to be that observant to notice that between all those boobs and buttocks they're actually telling a story.

I understood when Brienne and Jaime were naked, even with Jon and Ygritte, it was normal for Robb and Talis. This one is simply above me.

Duh. But you're claiming that, let me quote, they don`t care about story telling as much as they care for showing nude bodies Which is way, way exaggerated. In a 57-minutes episode they put maybe four minutes of nudity and that's enough to say the nudity is the most important thing on the show?

And in this scene, it seemed lik Melisandre`s nudity was more importnat than what she has actually been doing. I don`t understand why Gendry couldn`t be paralised, and her not due to her ruby around the neck. Why did we have to see her naked?As Ran wonderfully said in his analysis of Second Sons, if we wanted to see nudity, we would watch Spartacus or something else.

But, half of the times something important is said, someone is naked on the show. This scene was important and I can`t see the reason why we needed naked Melisandre where there were so many other options at the table? And when someone wants to include nudity in every episode, read what director of Blackwater episode said - Ran quoted him, we have to ask what`s the point?And in both times I was thinking more of nude scenes than entire show. I expressed myself badly.

No, but I'll take it when it's offered.Well, there is a difference when someone offers you champagne and caviar, and TV nudity. In champagne you enjoy, because you taste it, in TV nudity you have just a pale image that resembles, and is nothing like reality.

In champagne you enjoy, because you taste it, in TV nudity you have just a pale image that resembles, and is nothing like reality.I don't know; I grew up with a cathode ray TV with horrible reception.  To me this HDTV stuff is like magic, and Carice (who is an AMAZING, world-renowned actress with a beautiful body, whether you like her as Mel or not) looked better than any reality I'm familiar with.  And I'm sure the ladies and gay guys enjoyed looking at young Gendry as well.
408	mafalda	2013-05-20	Naked Mel > naked Ros just saying.Pretty good episode. Was it me or was Cersei just talking about Castamere a bit odd? It didn't seem to necessarily fit -- kinda like they just put it in there to setup for next episode. Oh well.I think the best part about this episode was the pacing. No scene felt rushed and the transitions were just smooth and natural. I really wish they do this in future episodes. Deal with only half the characters but give them a proper sub-arc instead of just giving each person 2minutes token time on screen.Also, HOW GOOD WAS IT TO NOT HAVE THEON THIS EPISODE!!!!!!As pretty as Mel is, and as much as I hated Ros, I must respectfully disagree. Ros was WOW, a curvy AND fit body (the chick had ABS). She was gorgeous. Shame the entire reason she was killed off was because she didn't want to do nudity anymore.I was sad how much they changed the Sansa/Tyrion wedding from the book. The initial impact came from the fact Sansa found out just as she was getting dressed by Cersei's maids so she was in shock and had to go to the sept straight away.And what was wrong with Tyrion's line- "that's why they have whores for men like me" (or a line somewhat like that)? Would it have hurt to have just kept that line in?That was the only complaint I had about that scene. I didn't care about her not kneeling or whatever everyone's upset about.I already hate Daario. I want to kill him myself. Bah! I haven't even finished watching, but BAH! Die, Daario!*Unsheaths sword* How dare you!

Shame the entire reason she was killed off was because she didn't want to do nudity anymore.This is just speculation based on a one off comment made by a cast member, that didnt mention any names. Its not fact, so its probably best to stop reporting it as such.
410	Koi No Yokan	2013-05-20	Explain me why did we need a naked Melisandre to preform leeches ritual, and why of all places his penis was the best place to put one (although Robb`s penis led him to his doom, so that might be some kind of foreshadowing)? I understood when Brienne and Jaime were naked, even with Jon and Ygritte, it was normal for Robb and Talis. This one is simply above me. I don`t see what kind of story her boobs and buttocks are telling, but that`s just me.Did you not hear her whole "lamb to the slaughter" discussion with Stannis earlier? Getting him aroused made perfect sense to me. Mel is a seductive woman, and it's implied heavily in the books.As for the leeches, I see it this way; heart leech for Robb, beloved King of the North; stomach leech for Balon, the "middle" King of Westeros; and the penis leech for Joff, the Dick down in King's Landing.
411	Hrafnsmerki	2013-05-20	Shame the entire reason she was killed off was because she didn't want to do nudity anymore.Wait, what? Where did you read that?
412	Master Forel's Fro	2013-05-20	Shame the entire reason she was killed off was because she didn't want to do nudity anymore.What are you saying? I thought D&D finally came to their senses i was giving them credit, now I personally wanna thank that actress that played Ros.
413	Khal Pono	2013-05-20	Wait, what? Where did you read that?It's just speculation.  Oona Chaplin claimed one of her co-stars is tired of showing her tits and won't do it anymore.  Everyone assumed it was Emilia Clarke but last episode proved them wrong.  Now ppl are speculating it was Esme Bianco.  Silly.http://www.telegraph...ess-scenes.htmlAnyway, people who said it was Emilia weren't paying attention.  On the Jimmy Kimmel show prior to the start of the season, Kimmel pointed out that she spent the whole 1st season naked and asked if we'd get to see her naked this season.  Emilia tried to play coy but essentially said yes.  Also she was on Broadway this spring, naked as can be, in a bathtub scene in Breakfast at Tiffany's.

414	Tywin's bastard	2013-05-20	As Ran wonderfully said in his analysis of Second Sons, if we wanted to see nudity, we would watch Spartacus or something else.That was one of the least clever things he's ever written then. If you haven't learned that this show has a good portion of nudity by now then you can't have paid any attention whatsoever to this show.The ratonal person's line of thought: If I don't want to see nudity I'll watch something other than GoT since it has a lot of it.The irrational person's line of thought: If I don't want to see nudity I'll watch a show that I know has it and then complain about it.The worst parts of this fan base are seemingly worse than the worst parts of the TV show.

She could have poisoned him, and have the same effect.

And it was great remark, at least in my book.There are scenes when nudity is justified - Brienne and Jaime, Robb and Talisa, Jon and Ygritte, but to add whenever you want just for the sake of having it, is nonsensical. So, what, we haven`t seen her naked this year, big deal.We know there will always be nudity in the show. We are just against nudity for the sake of nudity. It has to have some sense of why actor/actress is nude.
417	cybobbie	2013-05-20	Why is everybody more disturbed by the nudity than THE GODDAMN LEECH ON GENDRY'S PENIS?I have the same question.
418	mafalda	2013-05-20	This is just speculation based on a one off comment made by a cast member, that didnt mention any names. Its not fact, so its probably best to stop reporting it as such.It's obvious who it is. How many actresses have done nudity in a continuing role? I'm not the only one who mentions that the article is more than likely talking about Ros. Don't know why it's bothering you so much.Anyways, for the people asking about the article, you can find it here.http://www.telegraph...ess-scenes.html
419	Gran de Lys	2013-05-20	I had no problem with the kneeling because the show drastically altered the context of her wedding. It was sprung on her, she's dressed and hustled to the sept to marry a man who had never been floated to her as a husband. Her act of defiance hints at how generally cold and shitty she is to Tyrion (justified or not; I'm not getting into that part) during their short marriage, and sours her in his eyes (later he muses bitterly, to paraphrase, "She would not bend those stiff Stark knees").
My problem with the scenario was Joffrey taking the stool. Of course he's the absolute worst, but to play an adolescent prank like that, at a royal wedding, in the Sept of Baelor, in front of granddad ...! I didn't buy it. And I didn't buy the widespread tittering among a crowd full of people who may want to suck up to the titular king but must know who really rules, and you don't want to piss him off in church. Joff acting the fool and the crowd snickering demonstrates an implausible lack of respect for the circumstances.

Don't know why it's bothering you so much.Anyways, for the people asking about the article, you can find it here.http://www.telegraph...ess-scenes.htmlMy issue is more that you are saying that that is definitely why she was written out of the show. When it is not even absolutely certain that it is her. For instance, this was posted once season 3 filming was done, it could still easily be referring to Emilia. Also, how could it be refering to Esme, when she's been written out of the show already, and wont be back? How can it possibly be her?

421	-Ghost-	2013-05-20	Has the show explained why Joffrey and Maergery are not married yet? (and I can't remember, was as an explanation for this given in the books?)You'd think they would all want to seal that pact ASAP.Im not sure about the show, but in the book they plan it for the same day as the new century and Joff's b - day too, I think.
422	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-05-20	I have heard it, but again that doesn`t justify the nudity. She could have poisoned him, and have the same effect.Because poisoning the blood you want to be as perfect as possible for a ritual is a good idea?

You or I can think it wasn't a good reason but to say that there was no reason is absolute nonsense. Melisandre always uses her sex appeal and this was a case of her luring her victim into a trap.

Goodness.I dont understand, you dont care, yet your angrily replying regardless?

Sorry that I didnt pick up that you were joking when it was definitely not clear at all.
428	Mladen	2013-05-20	Because poisoning the blood you want to be as perfect as possible for a ritual is a good idea?You do remember that Edric was sick and was given medicine when those leeches came to Melisandre`s property.

Melisandre did use her appeal and seduced Stannis, but I can remember only one time she was naked, with Davos when she gave birth to shadow-child. Melisandre had other ways to do that, and inability to see that is short-sightness that is rarely seen.

Some details are different, such as Melissandre's insistence that the blood be Kosher which actually totally makes sense from a religious zealot's perspective. Better realize that the show isn't the book soon or you're always going to be complaining about things that are ultimately pretty trivial and thus enjoying the experience less.

Maybe I should stop talking like a damn sailor /stillsick.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':stillsick:' />  On the other hand, I tend to get that way when being pushed about stupid stuff. Instead of asking "How do you think it's about Ros?" you go all omg stop spreading stuff that isn't confirmed. Speculation is enough for me to share an article I think will interest other posters.My point is I don't care. Take it however you want.

Three episodes this season has had zero nudity and had under a minute of naked breasts. I can't really account for more since I only know that because of other people's obsession with nudity. I don't care about it either way and such scenes pass me by as every other scene as I'm not uncomfortable with sex, nor aroused much by it in shows like this.

There were hundreds of ways that scene could have gone, but I actually enjoyed the way it went. Could it have been better? Yeah, probably. But I'm not in denial. You seem to be though.

Let`s face it, there are like a hundred ways that scene could have gone. And you all know it.There was a scene where she talked about how frightening a sheep before slaughter spoils the meat. I don't know how they could have made that more obvious without skipping the parallel altogether and stating it plainly.
437	Mladen	2013-05-20	You're trying to avoid the topic of our conversation. You said that Ran's line was good and I said it was completely illogical. That's what we're discussing.I am not avoiding it. I think he was completely right about that. If any show gave us so many unneccessary nudity, it`s Spartacus. When you cut down battle scenes and sex scenes, well, the show could have much less episodes. Although I do admit that battle scenes are done grotesquely beautiful and I like them, but for the sake of artistical part fo the show or even its plot, half the dozen sex scenes could have been cut off. And I see the same thing in GoT every once and a while.As for avoiding nudity once in a while, you make it sound like it's everywhere. Three episodes this season has had zero nudity and had under a minute of naked breasts. I can't really account for more since I only know that because of other people's obsession with nudity. I don't care about it either way and such scenes pass me by as every other scene as I'm not uncomfortable with sex, nor aroused much by it in shows like this.Me neither, but it seems that there is a great bunch of people who are so fond of those scenes that you could say that use these scene for masturbation (I am so sorry for stipulating the thread with discussion about it). The argument everyone here told me was that Carice Van Houten is hot, and none spoke of relevance of her nudity.What do you think the whole lambs to slaughter thing was? There was a direct parallel she drew with slaughtering a beast and performing a blood sacrifice to the LoL. She said it with her own words. There were hundreds of ways that scene could have gone, but I actually enjoyed the way it went. Could it have been better? Yeah, probably. But I'm not in denial. You seem to be though.Let we see this way. Melisandre talks to Gendry, gaining his confidence, making hiom believe that his safe, giving him all he wants, and then out of bleu she performs the ritual. There are ways that could have been done with her clothes off. As for me being in denial, I don`t understand your point, because it doesn`t make any sense.
438	Faint	2013-05-20	Does anyone else think that they might really go through with the Loras and Cersei wedding? I'm starting to realize it wouldn't really change the plot that much and would even give extra impetus for Jaime's resentment of Cersei as well as an even bigger reason for Cersei sending Loras to Dragonstone.
439	siknes	2013-05-20	I see your point and its a great scene in the book, but show Sansa is just at a different place. She seemed to have more sympathy for Tyrion than in the books. To be honest, I always found it upsetting that she wasn't more kind towards Tyrion. He was never cruel to her.It is because he is so ugly(book Tyrion) Same as Sandor, she can't look at them. She is too into her fairy-tales of handsome knights like Loras, good luck with getting that up honey.

She offers him wine, bathes him, gives him nice clothes. How long do you want this scene to be, 4 days so that she can build up a friendship with him? The quickest and most effective way of getting his guard down was to seduce him. The boy was just betrayed by people who he believed he could trust, for God's sake. Of course they like to show nudity -- because the viewers demand it as a majority. But this wasn't a case of inexplicable and tasteless nudity. You're in denial that your prejudice for anything being different from show to book causes you to come up with frivolous and poorly reasoned arguments.

She could have read the books and knows about the Walk of Shame.
442	ebevan91	2013-05-20	Lena wasn't nude at all though, ever. Can't be her.
It has to be Esme Bianco. It can't be Emilia because she wasn't even nude in season 2. Can't be Carice, Natalie, or Oona because they weren't present at all in season 1 and obviously Carice is pretty comfortable with being nude and so is Oona.
443	Summerfell	2013-05-20	Does anyone else think that they might really go through with the Loras and Cersei wedding? I'm starting to realize it wouldn't really change the plot that much and would even give extra impetus for Jaime's resentment of Cersei as well as an even bigger reason for Cersei sending Loras to Dragonstone.I have been wondering about this for some time now. The producers have shown that they don't mind changing the plot around a bit, and as far as I can remember Loras' plot, having them marry wouldn't be any larger of a change than the current Mel + Gendry plot (I'm sure that there are book purists that will say this is incorrect, but anyways). I honestly think it could go either way. Most book readers are assuming they won't be married because it doesn't happen in the books, but I wouldn't put it past them to go through with the wedding just to shock book readers.So yeah, I think it's a possibility.

You're in denial that your prejudice for anything being different from show to book causes you to come up with frivolous and poorly reasoned arguments.My arguments, unlike yours, are not frivolous and poorly reasoned. I just don`t see the need for nudity. I like several changes from the books made for TV, not all of them, but some are rather fine by me. Don`t put me in the box of `book purists`, for I am not one of them. And my arguments are not based of what majority thinks, I have my own brain and am capable of having my individual opinion. Sometimes it`s alligned with majority, and sometimes it`s not. Pure and simple.
445	JMJ	2013-05-20	Because poisoning the blood you want to be as perfect as possible for a ritual is a good idea?Also, Mel getting Gendry's member hard is one way to quickly get a significant blood supply to the leech she places down there...
446	Khal Pono	2013-05-20	will other countries have to wait 2 weeks too?You think they're going to allow other countries to see the Red Wedding before the U.S.? Not bloody likely!
447	Khal Pono	2013-05-20	Also, Mel getting Gendry's member hard is one way to quickly get a significant blood supply to the leech she places down there...Also a lot of spells (voodoo/witchcraft/vampirism) have to do with sex and eroticism so it wouldn't surprise me at all--and it goes with the general occult theme around Melisandre--if she deemed blood from an engorged member (as I stated earlier) to have special powers, as it represents King Robert's virility. Similarly, certain witchcraft spells in the real world specifically involve menstrual blood.  I totally bought it.  And I'm in love with Carice van Houten anyway.

The producers have shown that they don't mind changing the plot around a bit, and as far as I can remember Loras' plot, having them marry wouldn't be any larger of a change than the current Mel + Gendry plot (I'm sure that there are book purists that will say this is incorrect, but anyways). I honestly think it could go either way. Most book readers are assuming they won't be married because it doesn't happen in the books, but I wouldn't put it past them to go through with the wedding just to shock book readers.So yeah, I think it's a possibility.Yeah, the more I think about it, the more I realize it serves the ends of the show. Jaime will be devastated once he finds out his sister is married again, which could serve as the trigger for his growing resentment of her. And Cersei will be anxious to send Loras to his death in Dragonstone.
449	Tywin's bastard	2013-05-20	I am not avoiding it. I think he was completely right about that. If any show gave us so many unneccessary nudity, it`s Spartacus. When you cut down battle scenes and sex scenes, well, the show could have much less episodes. Although I do admit that battle scenes are done grotesquely beautiful and I like them, but for the sake of artistical part fo the show or even its plot, half the dozen sex scenes could have been cut off. And I see the same thing in GoT every once and a while.It still doesn't make sense to say that if you want to see nudity you'll watch Spartacus. How can someone not expect nudity from this show by now? That's why it wasn't just an nonconstructive, snide remark, it was downright nonsensical.Me neither, but it seems that there is a great bunch of people who are so fond of those scenes that you could say that use these scene for masturbation (I am so sorry for stipulating the thread with discussion about it). The argument everyone here told me was that Carice Van Houten is hot, and none spoke of relevance of her nudity.I couldn't care about if other people use those scenes for that even if I tried. I don't see how that can effect me.I don't really see why someone that thinks it's fine that the scene contained her nudity would bring up the relevance of it. That's a point for those that have a problem with it, as I see it. You don't ever have to show any nudity or violence, you could just cut away every time. People do want to see such things though, as well as the rest.One thing I can say for nudity is that I can appreciate it for going against the deeply rooted problem with it that our society has gotten through the plague of Christianity. It's a shame that we should still be so affected by something that was really just a reaction to the Roman Empire (the stance on sex and nudity, not Christianity itself).
450	BlueDragon	2013-05-20	Ok, first off, why are you in here, if you truly haven't read the books? It's clearly marked book spoilers!Liked the episode, the nudity doesn't bother me as much as some of the sex talk. The Titans bastard really let it fly, holy crap! IDK, I just had a hard time believing a Khaleesi would sit back and be disrespected like that. I know it shows she has restraint but still. And why would they meet the three best swordsman from a company of sellswords and not have the dragons there for protection? She could have easily been killed.Poor Arya, she actually seemed happy, for the first time since season 1, after hearing where they were going.Sansa/Tyrion wedding, eh, okSam the Slayer, just fine, nice to see him not be a coward.leaving the dragons out was probably a dollar decision, but i felt it was just wrong.  on the other hand, dario would not have come off so sexy if he had to dodge dragons in dany's bedroom.

However at the end Tywin had trouble forcing her, with that nasty crossbow bolt in his stomach (I hope they don't skip that!). So far the only change is the name of the man Cersei won't marry.
452	Summerfell	2013-05-20	Yeah, the more I think about it, the more I realize it serves the ends of the show. Jaime will be devastated once he finds out his sister is married again, which could serve as the trigger for his growing resentment of her. And Cersei will be anxious to send Loras to his death in Dragonstone.That seems reasonable. I've seen people suggest Cersei will appoint Loras to the Kingsguard to avoid marrying him, but this creates a plothole because Loras is apparently the only heir to Highgarden in show canon. This is what initially made me think that they might just go through with the wedding and avoid the whole conflict.ETA:But in the books Cersei was expected to remarry, too.

Perhaps it will play out the same way, then. Maybe they'll just skip over Loras being appointed to the Kingsguard?Forgive me, I'm currently rereading the books for the first time and don't recall too much. /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />

This is what initially made me think that they might just go through with the wedding and avoid the whole conflict.Would they really postpone the wedding that long? In order for Cersei to get Tommen to appoint Loras to the Kingsguard, this will have to occur after Tywin is dead, which is a long way off.
454	Faint	2013-05-20	But in the books Cersei was expected to remarry, too. However at the end Tywin had trouble forcing her, with that nasty crossbow bolt in his stomach (I hope they don't skip that!). So far the only change is the name of the man Cersei won't marry.No, actually, there has already been a substantial change. In the books, the Tyrells simply refused to marry Cersei to Willas, and that was that. In the television series, not only have the Tyrells accepted the marriage, they were forced into it.
455	Narrow C	2013-05-20	Oh, my goodness, people, some of you give me a headache.  Complaining that an HBO show includes nudity is like complaining that a soccer game includes grass or that a statue includes marble. Get over it. Consider it the price you pay for not having the plot determined by a focus group. (Yeah, the focus group decided Tyrion should be taller. Can you put Peter in heels?)
456	Kaitscralt	2013-05-20	I actually think this episode needed more nudity, come on HBO. The Mel scene should have been another ten minutes before she tied him up.
457	The Boar of Gore	2013-05-20	there was NO NEED to distract him.  It's just HBO wasting precious show minutes with sex and nudity. /agree.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':agree:' />  It made no sense. Some people (not me) complain when they throw in gratuitous sex scenes in brothels, but at least those scenes make sense, because those people have a reason for doing what they're doing.And putting a leech on his dick? What was that about?
458	QueenBeyondtheWeb	2013-05-20	I was disappointed they showed Stannis naming the three names with the leeches.  I think it's going to be obvious to the part of the audience that pays attention what it means.oh well.But we also got that info in the books pre-RW didn't we?
459	kingothenorth8159	2013-05-20	Loved this episode, I think that the sansa kneeling definitely had to be in there considering how much average viewers already dislike her. But I thought the QOT scene was a bit out of place and awkward. And i feel like loras marrying Cersei is kinda a throw away plot (at least to us bc D&D wouldnt make up plot lines with those two married). That and I imagine Cersei being more conniving than telling Margery that she'll kill her if she calls her sister again. I mean isn't the entire show about playing the game and acting like someone else with your true intentions clouded? By having her come out and say how she feels (in the middle of court no less) the writers made the scene feel very lazy. I loved everything that came after, especially Tyrion!
460	WhiteGuts	2013-05-20	I think the complaints are for the abuse of sex scenes in the series in general, not just that Gendry/Melisandre scene (which is not as gratuitous as people are saying). We're fed up, more or less.
I mean, if they spared us Ramsay's bitches for example last week, I'm sure the G/M scene wouldn't have provoked the same reactions.
461	Queen Rhaenys Targaryen	2013-05-20	You think they're going to allow other countries to see the Red Wedding before the U.S.? Not bloody likely! Awwwwwwwwwwwwww great 2 weeks. /bang.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bang:' />

In the television series, not only have the Tyrells accepted the marriage, they were forced into it.I'm sketchy on the timeline of events, but I think Cersei will probably try to postpone it, though I suppose it is somewhat doubtful she could hold out against Tywin for that long. Was Cersei ever actually engaged to anyone in the books? If not, then the whole situation is unprecedented and I wouldn't doubt they'll go through with it, even if it means Loras won't be on the Kingsguard. I think I was reading speculation on how Loras was going to get on the Kingsguard at all when he wasn't appointed after the Blackwater, but that doesn't strictly need to happen ever.

I think I was reading speculation on how Loras was going to get on the Kingsguard at all when he wasn't appointed after the Blackwater, but that doesn't strictly need to happen ever.She offered to accept Oberyn Martell, never knowing that Oberyn would have never married her for all the gold in Casterly Rock. So she was never actually engaged. She was offered to Willas, and denied, and then offered to Oberyn, who died before presumably rejecting her as well.
464	BaseBornBastard	2013-05-20	Does anyone else think that they might really go through with the Loras and Cersei wedding? I'm starting to realize it wouldn't really change the plot that much and would even give extra impetus for Jaime's resentment of Cersei as well as an even bigger reason for Cersei sending Loras to Dragonstone.I'm pretty sure it would have a massive effect on the plot. If they marry then Cersai will become Lady of Highgarden rather than the Queen Regent. She'll be shipped off to the Reach to start making little Tyrell babies with Loras.
465	Mark the Red	2013-05-20	Oh, and on he subject of Cersei, I don't think they made her horrible, they just made her bland and boring. A completely passive character with nothing to add. It's that or, as with Jon Snow, the actress is doing an atrocious job.Yes, Lena Headey is an atrocious actor.   Also, Daniel Day Lewis was phoning it in on his Lincoln performance last year.  Look man, if you don't like Cersei's character it has nothing to do with Lena's acting.  Saying a very accomplished actor is doing an "atrocious" job is so hypercritical it renders any actual or legitimate criticism of the character by you meaningless.  She is easily one of the best actors on the series.  My top three would be:(1) Charles Dance(2) Michelle Fairley(3) Maisie Williams or Lena Headey

She'll be shipped off to the Reach to start making little Tyrell babies with Loras.Only according to the logic of the books. There is no reason they would do the same thing in the television series. As concerns the dynastic effects of such a marriage, they would be mostly mitigated because there is no reason to suspect Cersei will survive into the future.
467	Janicia	2013-05-20	Why does it matter at all what the remaining members of the Night's Watch think of Sam?  When Sam gets back to the Wall, he's going to play politics to get Jon elected (his "slayer status being entirely irrelevant), tell Jon about the dragonglass (Jon will listen because he and Sam are friends), and then depart south.  It makes no difference whatsoever if the Night's Watch start calling him Slayer or not.  I like that he's developing into a quietly formidable person who is usually underestimated.
468	Faint	2013-05-20	Yes, Lena Headey is an atrocious actor.   Also, Daniel Day Lewis was phoning it in on his Lincoln performance last year.  Look man, if you don't like Cersei's character it has nothing to do with Lena's acting.

She is easily one of the best actors on the series.  My top three would be:(1) Charles Dance(2) Michelle Fairley(3) Maisie Williams or Lena HedleyI am a fan of Lena Hedley as well but I maintain Charlize Theron would have been perfect. Not only is Cersei her doppelgAnger, she basically played a version of Cersei in Snow White and the Huntsman.
469	Mark the Red	2013-05-20	I also think Kit Harington is a victim of the "Hayden Christensen" effect.  Whereby an otherwise decent actor is made to look bad  via a weak script or dialogue.  Someone commented last week that the real "Jon" came back merely by George R R Martin taking over that episodes script.  Why?  Because he had some fire in his belly again and talked smack to both Oren and Ygritte.   I'm no literature major, but thats what makes a main character likeable is that the reader/audience can relate to him / her or have similar emotional reactions if placed in the same situation.I really liked book Jon for that reason.  He has a chip on his shoulder at the wall, and for good reason.  He was considered the living embodiment of his father's dishonor his entire life, volunteered to go to the wall to live his entire life as a crow to regain some honor for his family, and STILL spends his days being judged by criminals and dumped on continuously by scumbags like Alliser Thorne and Janos Slynt.  Oh, and little prospects of getting laid too.  But despite all this rage, he keeps his act together and does his duty.  Thanklessly.  No wonder Stannis and him get along so well.  My favorite part in all the books was the Janos Slynt execution scene.  Jon gave him plenty of chances to save himself, but Janos sealed his own fate.  He did it calmly , coolly and honorably even though he must have been PISSED at being publicly insulted in front of all his men.Go Jon Go!  (Major aside from the episode 3-08 thread topic)

My top three would be:(1) Charles Dance(2) Michelle Fairley(3) Maisie Williams or Lena HedleyI love Lena and I don't mind the way she's portraying Cersei but there's no way in hell I'd categorize her as a better actor than Peter Dinklage, Diana Rigg, Aidan Gillen, or Conleth Hill......

Fair enough.  To each their own.  I don't particularly care for Aiden Gillen all that much, but I certainly don't see the range from Gillen that I have seen from Lena.  But I certainly would not call him atrocious either.  That was my point.

I think it's going to be obvious to the part of the audience that pays attention what it means.oh well.I noticed that too, but so far, none of my friends who hasn't read the books has commented about it. They either didn't pay attention or they simply thought it will be stopped at time. As a viewer, it's a bit shocking to find out they simply will kill two of the main protagonists so far, Joffrey and Robb.(maybe, they think that Gendry's blood isn't "good" and it won't work).
473	Lady Lea	2013-05-20	I also think Kit Harington is a victim of the "Hayden Christensen" effect.  Whereby an otherwise decent actor is made to look bad  via a weak script or dialogue.  No way, I doubt it's written in the script that Jon has to have his mouth hanging open the whole time and that gormless look on his face.

Besides, the actor playing Stannis delivered the lines so nonchalantly and slurred it's hard to make out what he actually said.
475	Lady Phedre	2013-05-20	man is it just me or was Tywin looking particularly dapper today in his leather clothes? Damn that Charles Dance is hot.Not just you! I also thought he was looking fine as all get out.

Not only is Cersei her doppelgAnger, she basically played a version of Cersei in Snow White and the Huntsman.This. I always think of either Charlize or Diane Kruger when reading Cersei. She never has Lena's face, and I do think she's a good actress, but she's not the Cersei I imagined and still imagine.^^^Fair enough.  To each their own.  I don't particularly care for Aiden Gillen all that much, but I certainly don't see the range from Gillen that I have seen from Lena.  But I certainly would not call him atrocious either.  That was my point.There. So the other poster was perfectly entitled to say he does't like Headey's acting, since as you put it, to each their own. Geez.As for Cersei's characterisation, and this is the writing, she has her moments. In the last episode she was great, during most of season 3 she's been a passive bore.

480	SeventySeven	2013-05-20	I think she will make him Kingsguard of Tommen after the purple wedding, going against her father.I think Loras will eventually willingly join the Kingsguard to get out of marrying her. He'll be the one rejecting her.
481	Mayhem	2013-05-20	I really enjoyed this episode, I liked the scene between Arya and the Hound although he seemed...sweeter to her than he was in the books. Tyrion drunk was pretty funny, and his threat to Joffrey was very well done. The White Walker looked great as it died, glad we finally saw Sam the slayer.
One thing im confused about, Darrio killed the Titan's bastard right? So that means Dany wont be attacked in the camp?
482	Arrogant Bastard	2013-05-20	One thing im confused about, Darrio killed the Titan's bastard right? So that means Dany wont be attacked in the camp?Probably not. The main point, I believe, of that attack happening was for Arstan to rescue Dany and then be outed as Barristan. That's already happened in the show.
483	JonDunn	2013-05-20	They did great with Jon scenes in season 1.
I think people are underestimating how difficult shooting must have been in Iceland.  Unbearably cold, few hours of daylight so they had less takes per scene plus they had less screentime to give overall to Jon's story.
Jon's story was immediately better in episode 7 once he was below the wall again and I don't think it just has to do with GRRM's script.  I think Jon's story will be great in episodes 9 and 10 and his scenes will be good in season 4 as well.
484	JaTyAdo	2013-05-20	Liked:
-Cersei telling the story of 'Rains of Castamere' to Margaery and Cersei ignoring Loras... I'm loving how Lena's playing Cersei's bitchiness...
-Sam killing the whitewalker
-Stannis freeing Davos
-The Hound and Arya's conversation taken from the book
-Daario and Mero(the guy who was bad-mouthing Dany)... They're hot, /drool.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':drool:' />  especially the Mero guy and I like Daario in the book, mostly because he could talk back to arrogant Dany /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
-Tyrion and Joffrey clash at  the wedding celebration
Disliked:
-Stannis having this tone of not-giving-a-fuck in sacrificing Gendry
-How cool Arya looks at Stranger's back.. shouldn't she suppose to be tied up so she couldn't flee? ...because Arya in the book wouldn't stay that cool when she's abducted
-how Sansa and Tyrion's wedding play out 
-Joffrey taking the stool for Tyrion to stand on, making him look more pitiable
Is there a Robb/Catelyn scene? And Wendel Manderly is going to be shown in episode 9? Only now and we got  loads of annoying Shae and Talisa scenes... I only watched the clips from youtube.. so it's most likely not the whole part..

(Major aside from the episode 3-08 thread topic)Hayden Christensen is a terrible actor and it had nothing to do with Star Wars.  He's not getting black listed for that script.I've got no issue with how Kit portrays Jon.  Jon Snow is a broody character in the first place who doesn't really come out of his shell until he's lord commander.  I've thought he's been at his best when he steps up and challenges the wildlings, and that will only increase going forward as he dictates the NW.
486	Janicia	2013-05-20	The awkwardness and aggression at Tyrion<U+0080><U+0099>s wedding was delightful.  I like how the show has emphasized the big culture clash between the Tyrells who are friendly, at least on the surface, and the more aggressive, callous Lannisters.  Margery and Loras  trying to talk to Cersei was delightful.  The Tyrells do not want Loras to marry Cersei for all sorts of reasons, but they try a friendly approach.  Cersei has no tolerance for their fake enthusiasm for the idea and firmly slaps them away. 
Kinda funny how people have been complaining that Cersei has been too weak and wilty, then she shows her claws and people complain that she<U+0080><U+0099>s insufficiently subtle. 
I also wondered if Loras<U+0080><U+0099> bad mood had anything to do with his memories of scolding Renly for avoiding Margery.  Now that he<U+0080><U+0099>s facing political marriage himself, he might feel more sympathy for Renly<U+0080><U+0099>s struggles. And maybe Loras pitied Sansa, or regretted losing the engagement to a pliable, polite bride?
Interesting speculation that Loras and Cersei might actually get married.  That would be pretty fun to watch.  And would give Loras a good motivation to run off to battle and get himself wounded.  /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />  But I don<U+0080><U+0099>t think it will happen, I think Cersei or Loras will figure out how to get him appointed to the kingsguard to prevent it.  Which would make Loras echo Jaime more strongly - I'm looking forward to their interactions.  
It was fun to see Bronn waving to Sansa at the wedding, and later she had a chat with Varys.  It would have been nice to see Lancel and Kevan <U+0080><U+0093> maybe that<U+0080><U+0099>s PW?  Good to see Pycelle enjoying himself too.
487	Druze	2013-05-20	Why is everybody more disturbed by the nudity than THE GODDAMN LEECH ON GENDRY'S PENIS?Honestly my friend after last week's corrective surgery on Theon a leech on your junk seems about as bad as a case of blue balls.

In this episode Stannins named all of those usurpers who will die, but while reading the books i never understood who it was that actually killed Joffrey.
Balon was killed by Melisandres ghost i think i have read?
Robb was killed by the Freys, cause of the betrayal and cause they complot with Lannister?
Did i miss who it was that killed Joffrey?
And please correct me if my facts are wrong!

They always seemed like a good team in the books with a lot of underlying emotions that really were never really explored.

Congratulations Slayer, you have killed Bambooza McShattery the lvl 1 Other! You have now inherited his igloo, three sets of cold-proof loincloths, and a subscription to Miss Wight magazine! Enjoy your last days of living!
So hooray for Sam the Slayer scene... Now we won't see them again for ages (only mentioned) /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />
I seriously wanted those ravens to caw out: You had one job Sam! One job!
Only scene I didn't like as much was the last of the Arya/Hound. The reveal that the Hound was taking her to the Twins seemed rather casual and needed more build up imo. =/
493	Mark the Red	2013-05-20	This. I always think of either Charlize or Diane Kruger when reading Cersei. She never has Lena's face, and I do think she's a good actress, but she's not the Cersei I imagined and still imagine.There. So the other poster was perfectly entitled to say he does't like Headey's acting, since as you put it, to each their own. Geez.As for Cersei's characterisation, and this is the writing, she has her moments. In the last episode she was great, during most of season 3 she's been a passive bore.Maybe HBO couldn't afford either Charlize Theron or Diane Kruger.  Maybe either actress didn't want to show their bits and pieces to the world, body double or not.  A harsh truth is that HBO's casting department has to look long term to cast this major role in the series.  I think Lena Headley is  a great Cersei because she is not TOO beautiful to play the role she will have to play in Seasons 5/6/7(?)/ 8(?) That's right, I said it.  This also allows her to be a credible "evil" character.  Sorry man, but Charlize Theron is just too good looking to have any chance at this.  For instance, she's so good looking, that I had mostly "impure thoughts" about her character during most of her "serious" roles in Prometheus or Snow White.  Sorry.  Try make Kate Upton out to be a reviled female lead role in a movie.  All the George Lucas CGI magic or Shakespearean film school won't help you.Maybe I interpreted the book Cersie wrong, but Cersei is clearly depicted as haggard after her pennance walk.  I suppose they could try doing the old hollywood trick of putting on glasses and a baggy sweater to make a gorgeous woman look "ugly", but I doubt the audience would buy it.   Lena Headey is a great fit; she can play both beautiful and haggard roles without massive amounts of makeup (i.e. Monster) either way.I guess Cersei is being passive because her side is mostly winning.  Also because Tywin is directly calling the shots now.  I dont see how Charlize Theron could be more dynamic this season given that until the recent marriage arrangement with Loras and short of Jamie coming back, she's gotten everything she's wanted.Finally, buddy didn't say he didn't like her acting.  He said her acting was atrocious.  That is a huge difference and I called BS on it.  It would be similar to someone here posting that Charlize Theron is a total 2/10 swamp donkey in terms of looks.  Sure, anybody is entitled to say it.  But its just not a serious, credible or accurate comment in any conceivable definition of those words.

500	KnightsOfDany	2013-05-20	Loved this episode! i think mostly because of the lay out. Keeping it between three locations and being only book ended by others felt right.
- The Stannis and Davos stuff was great both actors gave a a great performance
- I loved Darrio, in the small sample size its clear he has the swagger, hes blade hilts also where as imagined.
- More strong stuff from Emlia Clarke, shes killing it this season
- Drunk Tyrion was something legendary for the show, ive never laughed so hard.
- Also strong stuff from Sophie Turner i like Sansa more on the show
- Lastly the Killing of the White Walker was tense and fantastic

Try make Kate Upton out to be a reviled female lead role in a movie.  All the George Lucas CGI magic or Shakespearean film school won't help you.Snow White was not a serious role of Charlize's (nor Prometheus lbr). Have you never seen Monster? Charlize Theron can do anything.  But she is definitely too expensive for HBO.
502	Laxen	2013-05-20	How she's portrayed doesn't seem to affect how her fans perceive her.And I think there's pretty compelling evidence it was a faceless man that kills Balon, probably hired by Euron.Wich evidence do you refer to?
503	BlackTalon	2013-05-20	I have always thought that Charlize Theron would make a terrific Val. It is a comparatively small role so she wouldn't be tied up too much with shooting for GoT. She is a huge fan of the series, after all.
504	David Selig	2013-05-20	I pray that GRRM kills off Mary Sue-Sansa soon so we can stop hearing from her fans. Mary Sues are author self-insert wish fulfilment type characters. Who the hell would want to be Sansa, her life is terrible throughout the series.
505	mbuehner	2013-05-20	Mary Sues are author self-insert wish fulfilment type characters. Who the hell would want to be Sansa, her life is terrible throughout the series.In fan fiction. This strong, admirable character that people seem to want to see on the tv show doesn't exist in the books, so I have to assume its fan fic theyre pining for.
506	mbuehner	2013-05-20	Wich evidence do you refer to? <U+0080><U+009C>I dreamt of a man without a face, waiting on a bridge that swayed and swung. On his shoulder perched a drowned crow with seaweed hanging from his wings.<U+0080><U+009D> Ghost of High Heart Plus Euron had been banished by Euron and showed up back on Pyke immediately after Balon's death ('as soon as the body was cold'), which would have been unwise had Balon been alive.
507	AmareiBlanetree	2013-05-20	There's no way she could have done it in the show without coming off as a dick, and the writers knew it.I agree. So many TV viewers already hate Sansa already (for no reason, IMO), so they took that part out.

512	7V3N	2013-05-20	The thing is, we know for sure they add nudity for the sake of nudity, because Neil Marshall provided an anecdote of being outright told by an executive producer that he wanted as much nudity as possible in the brothel scene in "Blackwater". That's the attitude people are complaining about, and scenes that appear to be the result of that attitude.This.Plus, has anyone ever complained about Emilia Clarke (Dany)'s nudity? No, because it makes sense. The scenes with her nudity are scenes that contribute to plot and are not there to provide masturbation material (though I am sure some have been used as such).Contrastingly, Melisandre got naked (she looks gorgeous, that is not my problem) just so she could tie up Gendry? Yeah, that makes sense (read with sarcasm). I get that his excitement means blood pumps faster, but fear gets the heart racing too. Having two guards hold him down and tying him up would have certainly gotten his blood pumping. It was simply an excuse to include nudity, not a reason.Most of us have no problem with nudity and sex. The problem is that we do not watch the show for the nudity and sex - we watch it for the characters and the story. Dany having sex with Drogo was part of building her character. We learned nothing from Mel screwing Gendry, except that Mel loves a nice Baratheon shaft.

513	Billy Rivers	2013-05-20	Much better than last week. The Gendry diversion from the books is interesting but also a shame because it kind of closes off some avenues his story could have gone in my opinion.
Melisandre is gorgeous and perfect in the role, Sam the Slayer was good and needed to be included, agree with people preferring this Daario to the on in the books and I don't see it as a huge loss to not have Ben Plumm and the Storm Crows just necessary trimming of minor characters.
Wedding scenes were much as I expected and I didn't have a problem with them although I do feel it would undermine Cersei to actually have her go through with the marriage to Loras and I don't expect this to happen. Agree that the Hound was too nice but television is a less subtle medium and the viewers need to be pushed toward what I'm assuming will be a redemptive arc for Sandor.
So far the only thing that is really worrying me is how the Jeyne Westerling/Talisa storyline is going to be tied up, why the Blackfish is seemingly going to be at the RW and where the blazes are all the Northmen!
514	Billy Rivers	2013-05-20	The argument about nudity is pretty pointless. I would say that any post watershed tv drama includes sex scenes and people expect it plus the books are not exactly chaste in their content and descriptions. I also thought Gendry's 'Stand by Me' moment with the leech was pretty amusing.
515	Tony Soprano	2013-05-20	Two kings will fall this season, it seems. We have the Red Wedding in the next episode, and from what we've seen in the trailers, Yara's story is continuing in Season 3 - which only makes sense if they plan on Balon biting the dust this season too.

517	Faint	2013-05-20	Three years in and people are still talking about the nudity. At what point is everyone just going to accept that HBO will continue to show copious nudity and accept it or stop watching? This will not change in Season 4 or the season after, and so on.
518	King of the Road	2013-05-20	I can't quite believe it, but I actually liked Daario. In the books he is without a doubt the one character I would gladly hand over to Ramsay Bolton, and yet here his swagger seemed both natural and justified. I'm looking forward to his rivalry with Ser Jorah and maybe even Ser Barristan.Two kings will fall this season, it seems. We have the Red Wedding in the next episode, and from what we've seen in the trailers, Yara's story is continuing in Season 3 - which only makes sense if they plan on Balon biting the dust this season too.Surely that'll be this season. Then by Season 4 it's two kings down, one to go. Should be good!
519	Billy Rivers	2013-05-20	Does anyone think that if we do see Balon Greyjoy's death we will get a culprit? Perhaps Jaquen?
520	Words of Winter	2013-05-20	Explain me why did we need a naked Melisandre to preform leeches ritual, and why of all places his penis was the best place to put one (although Robb`s penis led him to his doom, so that might be some kind of foreshadowing)? I understood when Brienne and Jaime were naked, even with Jon and Ygritte, it was normal for Robb and Talis. This one is simply above me. I don`t see what kind of story her boobs and buttocks are telling, but that`s just me.Maybe she just wanted some.  I thought the nudity scene was too long.  I was like, ok you're naked, awesome, but we got things to do as well.  Stannis looked a little PO'd when his get-it-on woman was getting-in-on with Baratheon 2.0 which made up for it.  you would think  he would say Joffrey's name first, like in the books. In the books, there was some hesitation before throwing the Robb starck voo-doo leach in the fire.  But TV =/= books.  I need to keep telling myself this.
521	7V3N	2013-05-20	Three years in and people are still talking about the nudity. At what point is everyone just going to accept that HBO will continue to show copious nudity and accept it or stop watching? This will not change in Season 4 or the season after, and so on.The argument continues because Ros was a scapegoat. Fans were able to look at her and blame her for HBO's desire to fill every episode with sex and nudity. She was entirely original to the show and took up more screen time than major characters. It was believed that her death meant less forced nudity, but instead it meant the nudity would be more widespread across different characters' stories.People have the right to voice their complaints. Not every show needs nudity. Boardwalk Empire (a great HBO series) had incredibly little nudity in comparison, and when it did it was mostly part of character development. People should not stop complaining. It's called critiquing and some people even get paid to do it! The show is made for us fans, so our opinions of the show do matter. After critics and fans alike were highly critical of last season's diversions (mainly Quarth), we have seen the show treat Dany's story with care, making it incredibly true to the novels. And I think most would agree her storyline has been one of the strongest this season.Never tell fans to stop voicing their opinions, because the show is made for us.

524	Words of Winter	2013-05-20	I think I'm getting in over my head a bit. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />I'm sketchy on the timeline of events, but I think Cersei will probably try to postpone it, though I suppose it is somewhat doubtful she could hold out against Tywin for that long. Was Cersei ever actually engaged to anyone in the books? If not, then the whole situation is unprecedented and I wouldn't doubt they'll go through with it, even if it means Loras won't be on the Kingsguard. I think I was reading speculation on how Loras was going to get on the Kingsguard at all when he wasn't appointed after the Blackwater, but that doesn't strictly need to happen ever.I seem to recall Tywin in the show saying Cersei and Loras will wed after Joffrey's royal wedding so it doesn't take away from that.  We know what happens at that wedding, so maybe Tywin doesn't force the issue or doesn't have time because his own son is accused of killing the king.  Then he gets a really sharp pain in his bowels . . .

He was asking how long people would keep complaining about the same thing. You'd think people either get fed up with something and stop watching, or get used to it. Of course some people seem to take great delight in being negative so that part of course play against that. Critics are different since they get paid and are forced to review a lot of things, which of course means that they have two reasons fans don't have to keep doing it. As for people thinking that Ros was the reason for the nudity, that wasn't particularly bright. There has consistently been plenty of other nudity than her (especially this season where she wasn't nude at all), and while there might be a little more of some nudity nothing is as detailed as it sometimes gets in the books. I think this should have been expected by everyone that thought it through.As for Boardwalk Empire, I haven't seen that but I'd say that the 1920s America was pretty uptight about such things. That's hardly the case of many places in Westeros and Essos, nor was it in Rome, which in turn gave the kind of HBO show named so. It always felt very obvious to me that Rome would be the closest analogy to GoT when it came to TV shows.And to think that our voices about season 2 affected much how Dany was treated in this season seems like wishful thinking. There are quite obvious differences in her storylines in ACoK and ASoS. Season 2 had a lot of changes since they wanted to do something more active than her storyline in ACoK, while ASoS has plenty of action (although few chapters) that translates very well as it is. Still this week's episode had a lot of differences from the novel, so your claim that it's "incredibly true" is weirdly timed.As for your last sentence he didn't tell anyone to stop. And just because people are free to express their opinions as they like doesn't mean that people in turn can't question questionable behavior.
531	rmholt	2013-05-20	I'm glad I'm not the only one who noticed that. He should have said "bloody wedding".... and apart from that, his tone is way too nice. I cannot wait to see how he smashes that axe in Arya's back. I hope they won't cut out such a scene.I am getting a little annoyed at people who complain about deviations from the book and then mention a scene from the book that never happened. This isnt the first and wont be the last.
532	silentwanderer	2013-05-20	It was funny, people in the books actually mistook them for Father and daughter/son. They always seemed like a good team in the books with a lot of underlying emotions that really were never really explored.I remember it too, Arya couldn't kill him after they spent half the Autumn together.She said it was because of  Mycah, but it read like they both knew this wasn't true.I can't wait to see that on the show.

537	Maxthestig	2013-05-20	Here is my review of this weeks episode ! Would be great to get some views of fellow Game of Thrones Lovershttp://squarevision....nd-sons-review/I would give this weeks episode a 7 or 8 out of 10.Much better than last weeks.I'm not happy with everyone hate for Stannis I love him !Daario was decent I thought I wouldn't like the actor.Sam was great although disappointing scene.The wedding lived up to the book !!!
538	MizasterJ	2013-05-20	Can hardly believe how Stannis casted a leech into the fire and stated Balon Greyjoy's name. I know this is the way it was in the book but on the show the Greyjoys have become so irrelevant that it doesn't matter.
Also dislike the way the show in general seems to almost ignore the events of the war instead focusing on the minor events of each character. 
Its very easy for the casual viewer to forget there is a war going on and who or what is being fought over. 
If the show were to include even a little of Asha's exploits possibly the Greyjoys would be relevant but they screwing themselves in future seasons by not including the Greyjoys now.
539	Janicia	2013-05-20	Im thinking the show might use a gendry-Mel smokemonster instead of an FM. In the book it was a "man without a face" but not nec Jaqen.  The source is the old woman at high heart.It would be a strange for Stannis to direct his single-use super assassin at Balon when there are quite a few more relevant and threatening targets.  Balon is a second tier problem for Stannis.  Anyway, Euron's likely involvement in Balon's death is pretty important going forward in the Greyjoy storyline.  That does bring up an interesting point - I wonder who Stannis should assassinate if Melissandre did spawn another super assassin?  Probably Tywin, but killing Margery would also make a huge mess in the capital and probably destroy the Lannister - Tyrell alliance.

I know this is the way it was in the book but on the show the Greyjoys have become so irrelevant that it doesn't matter.It seems like they'll catch us up with Asha and Balon at the end of this season and have more of a Greyjoy focus next season.  I agree it would have been nice to see more of Asha this season, but hasn't she just been hanging onto her captured castle this entire time?  The Greyjoys don't do much of interest until after Balon's death.
541	rmholt	2013-05-20	Can hardly believe how Stannis casted a leech into the fire and stated Balon Greyjoy's name. I know this is the way it was in the book but on the show the Greyjoys have become so irrelevant that it doesn't matter.Also dislike the way the show in general seems to almost ignore the events of the war instead focusing on the minor events of each character.Its very easy for the casual viewer to forget there is a war going on and who or what is being fought over.If the show were to include even a little of Asha's exploits possibly the Greyjoys would be relevant but they screwing themselves in future seasons by not including the Greyjoys now.Yeah I was imagining the audience going "who?" after Balon's leech was burned
542	rmholt	2013-05-20	Actually, judging by the synopsis for the season finale, it looks like all three kings will fall this season.Wow really?? RW AND PW?  Kind of leaves the second half of Book 3 lacking in something to do for next season.  Well, if so I am sure they will come up with something.  Theon still has his toes.
543	7V3N	2013-05-20	I'm sorry if someone else brought this up, but did HBO ever explain why they made the White Walkers look so different from the books?  Martin describes them as almost alien like, graceful, and clad in strange armor.  HBO has them looking like zombies.This is what GRRM told an artist who was depicting GoT as a comic:'The Others are not dead. They are strange, beautiful<U+0080> think, oh<U+0080> the Sidhe made of ice, something like that<U+0080> a different sort of life<U+0080> inhuman, elegant, dangerous.'
544	-Ghost-	2013-05-20	Actually, judging by the synopsis for the season finale, it looks like all three kings will fall this season.What makes you say that from reading this? Unless there's some other one?&ldquo;Mhysa&rdquo; synopsis: 
	Spoiler  Joffrey challenges Tywin. Bran tells a ghost story. In Dragonstone, mercy comes from strange quarters. Dany waits to see if she is a conqueror or a liberator. (Written by David Benioff & D. B. Weiss; directed by David Nutter.)
545	7V3N	2013-05-20	He didn't say that people don't have a right to voice their complaints. He was asking how long people would keep complaining about the same thing. You'd think people either get fed up with something and stop watching, or get used to it. Of course some people seem to take great delight in being negative so that part of course play against that. Critics are different since they get paid and are forced to review a lot of things, which of course means that they have two reasons fans don't have to keep doing it. As for people thinking that Ros was the reason for the nudity, that wasn't particularly bright. There has consistently been plenty of other nudity than her (especially this season where she wasn't nude at all), and while there might be a little more of some nudity nothing is as detailed as it sometimes gets in the books. I think this should have been expected by everyone that thought it through.As for Boardwalk Empire, I haven't seen that but I'd say that the 1920s America was pretty uptight about such things. That's hardly the case of many places in Westeros and Essos, nor was it in Rome, which in turn gave the kind of HBO show named so. It always felt very obvious to me that Rome would be the closest analogy to GoT when it came to TV shows.And to think that our voices about season 2 affected much how Dany was treated in this season seems like wishful thinking. There are quite obvious differences in her storylines in ACoK and ASoS. Season 2 had a lot of changes since they wanted to do something more active than her storyline in ACoK, while ASoS has plenty of action (although few chapters) that translates very well as it is. Still this week's episode had a lot of differences from the novel, so your claim that it's "incredibly true" is weirdly timed.As for your last sentence he didn't tell anyone to stop. And just because people are free to express their opinions as they like doesn't mean that people in turn can't question questionable behavior.Yes, but the changes they made are not changes, they are condensations. It is obvious that they cannot include every detail. Arya being Tywin's cupbearer made sense to condense the story into the given episode/time limit. Combining the mercenary groups is necessary as well. The plot has not changed, the minor details have. Trying to sell me on Second Sons' changes being even remotely similar to the Quarth changes is plain naive.And no, he did not say to stop complaining because he phrased it in a different way. If you want to defend him, become a lawyer because the his statement was clearly critical of viewers who complain about nudity. Critics view the same show as us. Elio and Linda are not necessarily professional critics, yet their critiques of the show are great, in-depth, and insightful. Every viewer is a critic. Getting paid to do so doesn't change that; it simply means that your writing is held to a higher standard and has an audience.If you had read what I said, you would know I said Ros was a scapegoat. She, to many viewers, represented HBO's boob-quota.And you really think that this forum's opinions do not affect the show? Dave and Dan casted Jason Momoa as Khal Drogo because they saw him suggested on this forum.One more thing, Boardwalk Empire takes place during the rise of the flapper movement. A movement completely centered around looking and acting sexy.ETA: People keep missing the point. I (like most, I believe) do NOT have a problem with nudity. We have a problem that HBO can't give us an episode without forcing nudity into a scene. The scenes where nudity occurs naturally are fine (think Dany in season 1). The problem is scenes where it just happens and you're left thinking, "Wait, why did they get naked for that," as was the Mel-Gendry situation. The scene is not the problem, it is that HBO forces the sex and nudity into every scene they can. I am sure they can't wait for Sophie Turner (Sansa) to turn 18.

The entire series might only last seven seasons and they have a lot of material to cover (see here).

547	Ampris	2013-05-20	Why is everybody more disturbed by the nudity than THE GODDAMN LEECH ON GENDRY'S PENIS?Maybe because they didn't actually show it? I'm not sure why he screamed, actually. From what I have heard leeches produce a numbing agent in their saliva, which is why when you're wading through their natural habitat you often don't feel them attaching to you. But I'll have to google to confirm.
548	Stormie	2013-05-20	We will know soon enough, but Oona Chapman's reportedly told GoT boses that she will no longer film topless scenes! Hmm.....I really hope it's because she won't be filming any scenes at all.Here's hoping!
549	rmholt	2013-05-20	Here's hoping!Since Talisa is pregnant and is not involved in any Lannister plot (that I know of) perhaps she will go with Robb to the Twins, sadly to perish at the RW along with Robb and his heir.  Pity.  For the plot - sacrifices must be made
550	Ampris	2013-05-20	I wish all the bitching about the nudity could be taken to the nitpicking thread. Not gonna argue that some of it is gratuitous but there is actually a lot more sex in the books. It's not that difficult to tune out the naked bodies. I hardly notice them anymore.
551	Howie Manderly	2013-05-20	aww. sam the slayer! but what's up with all the crows?They are how coldhands save sam and gilly from th walkers
552	Hoo	2013-05-20	We will know soon enough, but Oona Chapman's reportedly told GoT boses that she will no longer film topless scenes!I quite enjoyed her bottomless scene, will that be affected too?
553	Oakenfist	2013-05-20	I wish all the bitching about the nudity could be taken to the nitpicking thread. Not gonna argue that some of it is gratuitous but there is actually a lot more sex in the books. It's not that difficult to tune out the naked bodies. I hardly notice them anymore.I have no problem with nudity. I honestly think disliking nudity is an American thing, and pretty sure GRRM has a good quote about people who have a problem with nudity but not violence.However, pointless sex scenes I dislike and there weren't any in this last episode.

554	Dead The Poet	2013-05-20	Three years in and people are still talking about the nudity. At what point is everyone just going to accept that HBO will continue to show copious nudity and accept it or stop watching? This will not change in Season 4 or the season after, and so on.Well said.The other point I would make is that HBO is a subscription service is it not? And you know what their style and content is. We used to have a show here on Australian television called "Chances" and that had quite a bit of nudity, probably more then GOT I feel, and that was on free to air television.Personally I think there should be shows with more nudity in them so everyone just gets use to it. I am half joking about that one.

The quote you're talking about is someone's signature, can't remember whose, but I've seen it quite a bit. It is indeed a very good point.
557	CryHavoc!	2013-05-21	Once more, Peter Dinklage is playing his part beyond even an excellent rating. He has no love for his father and even less for his pestilential nephew. Alcohol has  the capacity to bring out the worst in people and it can be seen in this episode. It is good that they had Samwell killing the Cold Walker, but there is one small problem with the timing used. Samwell is a craven coward who is fearful of blood and violence but when he accidentally kills the Cold Walker, he is with some of the Night Watch and thus he earns their respect. It should be amusing how they deal with this faux pas.
558	YourMomsBox	2013-05-21	I've heard discusision of Joffrey putting more emphasis on Lannistor than Baratheon. This fairly true to the books. In FFC it is noted that JOff put a cloak of red and crimson for Lannister upon Margaery yet Tommen attatched a Baratheon style cloak on Margaery.
559	CKPS63	2013-05-21	a king's blood has power but blood from an engorged member is most powerful of all. it is known.I would guess it quickly became very UN-engorged the second the leeches came out.
560	Master Forel's Fro	2013-05-21	I would guess it quickly became very UN-engorged the second the leeches came out.The most talked about penis in westeros, do you think ramsay will come for him next? He's a very jealous boy.
561	jmk51	2013-05-21	If you don't like the nudity,  wait till it comes out on AMC.  Otherwise stop your batching,  it's HBOs MO. 
And Boardwalk Empire doesn't have lots of gratuitous nudity? They have women walking around naked and entertaining men all the time.  Gip got shot being "aphixiated."
562	David Selig	2013-05-21	If you don't like the nudity,  wait till it comes out on AMC.  Otherwise stop your batching,  it's HBOs MO.And Boardwalk Empire doesn't have lots of gratuitous nudity? They have women walking around naked and entertaining men all the time.  Gip got shot being "aphixiated." Yeah, Boardwalk Empire has just as much nudity and random sex scenes as GoT, maybe even more. There's a whole bunch of brothel scenes and showgirls or prostitutes who are just there for the boob quota.
563	Red Hound	2013-05-21	I don't have a problem with nudity unless it gets dragged on a bit too much, in example, sexposition by LF or the Theon scene of last week that was a tad too long.
Maybe I'm just more used to European cinema where nudity is like in real life, everywhere, as it's quite natural.
564	Master Forel's Fro	2013-05-21	I don't have a problem with nudity unless it gets dragged on a bit too much, in example, sexposition by LF or the Theon scene of last week that was a tad too long.Maybe I'm just more used to European cinema where nudity is like in real life, everywhere, as it's quite natural.I only have a problem with nudity when it takes away from the story, there's too many character and stories in GoT that need to be told that everytime they decide to put in unnecessary sex scenes or nudity it takes more away then it gives.
565	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2013-05-21	if people are complaining about how much pointless nudity is in GOT they've never seen Spartacus. for every one pair of boobs in GOT there's like 4 in that show.
566	Kingthlayer the captifth	2013-05-21	I agree about the sexstuff. Takes away too much important time from the storytelling!
One other thing I was kinda bummed about in this episode was the fact that Daario killed the Titans Bastard... Now Barristan the Boss can'ts save Dany from him with a wooden stick - a scene that just shows how fucking badass he is.
Maybe they'll keep it anyway, with just some random assassin from Yunkai or Meereen. I hope so anyway /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />)))
567	Master Forel's Fro	2013-05-21	Is daario leading Jorah n greyworm throughout the sewers? Doesn't that happen in meereen?
568	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2013-05-21	Is daario leading Jorah n greyworm throughout the sewers? Doesn't that happen in meereen?he's leading them into the camp of yunkai i think. the sewers were in mereen.
569	The_Gallows_Knight	2013-05-21	Was I the only one that took Barristan's comment about the unreliability and dishonorable ways of sellswords as a diss towards Jorah, as the latter spent years as one?
570	Rmg1313	2013-05-21	there was NO NEED to distract him.  It's just HBO wasting precious show minutes with sex and nudity.Disagree. Remember the scene earlier with Mel talking to Stannis about "killing lambs without letting the see the knife"? She needs a way to bound him so he can't interfere with the leeches. What other way would u tie him up with out him being alarmed?
571	rmholt	2013-05-21	Is daario leading Jorah n greyworm throughout the sewers? Doesn't that happen in meereen?How do you know it doesnt? They can move pretty far in two weeks <G> I swear people jump to conclusions based on, well, nothing.
572	Mulled Wino	2013-05-21	Not about the show but why do we have the exact same topics all week, it seems.  There's been no new topics for over a day now, just the same ones rehashing.
573	redriver	2013-05-21	The argument continues because Ros was a scapegoat. Fans were able to look at her and blame her for HBO's desire to fill every episode with sex and nudity. She was entirely original to the show and took up more screen time than major characters. It was believed that her death meant less forced nudity, but instead it meant the nudity would be more widespread across different characters' stories.People have the right to voice their complaints. Not every show needs nudity. Boardwalk Empire (a great HBO series) had incredibly little nudity in comparison, and when it did it was mostly part of character development. People should not stop complaining. It's called critiquing and some people even get paid to do it! The show is made for us fans, so our opinions of the show do matter. After critics and fans alike were highly critical of last season's diversions (mainly Quarth), we have seen the show treat Dany's story with care, making it incredibly true to the novels. And I think most would agree her storyline has been one of the strongest this season.Never tell fans to stop voicing their opinions, because the show is made for us.Qarth.
574	Silverx2	2013-05-21	ETA: People keep missing the point. I (like most, I believe) do NOT have a problem with nudity.

The scene is not the problem, it is that HBO forces the sex and nudity into every scene they can. I am sure they can't wait for Sophie Turner (Sansa) to turn 18.You mean Mel, someone notorious for fucking people with kings blood in order to have their power inside of her, wouldn't take the opportunity to "top off the tank" prior to leaching gendry? You might not think it "fits"  but you might also not understand it all either. Stop focusing on the nudity because you are missing story elements.

Book Mel only fucks Stannis to my recollection, and there is no sex angle to the leeches on Edric Storm. I know that it doesn't even "fit" with what the show itself created because if the lamb can't see the knife because it spoils the blood then it logically follows that the leeching too must be done without any fear, so tying him up and then dropping leeches on him while he screams was definitely showing him the knife and ruining the blood.  Logic fail.

577	Gran de Lys	2013-05-21	Perhaps an all-nudity thread is in order. Clothes-optional for the forumites.
578	boojam	2013-05-21	Is daario leading Jorah n greyworm throughout the sewers? Doesn't that happen in meereen?That's Meereen, Season 4, if they can afford it.Tho , the previews seem to show Jorah inside something, when all the battle action happened outside Yunkai.Hope D&D don't do a riff on that story.
579	Ginevra	2013-05-21	I will most likely calm down after I see it a second or third time, I just wonder how they're going to give her wolfness back.I have always disliked Sansa. Perhaps I've misunderstood her because it seems you all adore her. I am an Arya kind of girl, so I disliked the way she treated Arya, how she lied for Joffrey to suit her own selfish needs when lives were at stake, how stupid she used to be about Joffrey, and how stupid she continues to be about Loras. The only time I liked her was with the Hound, and I never thought that was a healthy relationship. I thought, reading the book, that her marriage to Tyrion would finally open her doe eyes, but alas. As to her wolfishness, I thought it was obvious she was more Tully than wolf when she was the first to lose her direwolf. I thought that was the perfect symbol of her lack of all things Stark.
580	juanml82	2013-05-21	Nah, she just isn't a powerful wizard in training like her siblings. As for brains, it looks like Jon is the exception there. Starks are rather dimwitted
581	Ginevra	2013-05-21	I notice a lot of people watch the show with their moms and complain about the sex scenes making them uncomfortable. try watching it alone.I try to watch alone, but my husband occasionally wonders in, seeing as it is his room too and all. I'm all, don't look at the TV! Don't look at the TV!  And I imagine he's all confused and like, why is it that she is the one watching porn?
582	raj34	2013-05-21	This is what GRRM told an artist who was depicting GoT as a comic:'The Others are not dead. They are strange, beautiful&hellip; think, oh&hellip; the Sidhe made of ice, something like that&hellip; a different sort of life&hellip; inhuman, elegant, dangerous.'I am definitely NOT a card carrying member of the nitpick crowd, but I wish in this case D&D had gone with GRRM's vision for the white walkers.
583	mbuehner	2013-05-21	Think how much better this show would be without all the nudity. And drinking. And gambling. And violence.
Fortunately there is this thing called a remote control if you cant handle the sight of a naked human being. Or in a real pinch the two flaps of skin above your eyeballs can be called into use.
584	Tywin's bastard	2013-05-21	Yes, but the changes they made are not changes, they are condensations. It is obvious that they cannot include every detail. Arya being Tywin's cupbearer made sense to condense the story into the given episode/time limit. Combining the mercenary groups is necessary as well. The plot has not changed, the minor details have.

The scene is not the problem, it is that HBO forces the sex and nudity into every scene they can. I am sure they can't wait for Sophie Turner (Sansa) to turn 18.I didn't compare it to the changes in season two, I said that it didn't align itself well with your comment about it being "incredibly true to the novels". Dany's story wasn't the only thing that got changes in the second season either, and several of those have continued the way they did. Robb's changes were more significant since he didn't really suffer from the lack of events that Dany does in that book, although his are of course often off page.He was critical of them, which I already said myself, but that's not even remotely the same thing as claiming that someone doesn't have a right to say something. Being critical to things is a natural part of discussions while claiming that the other person isn't allowed to say anything is diametrically opposed to discussion. And you don't have to be a lawyer to point out that someone said something different, it's basic reading comprehension and good manners to respond to what a person actually says.If you remembered what you wrote you would know that you wrote "it was believed that her death meant less forced nudity" and I said that anyone who thought that didn't analyze it properly since she was in no way the only one displaying nudity and she was in fact not nude whatsoever this season, making the point even heavier.When D&D were starting up the show they directly asked for input from the fans (I've been around here since before that). Now that the show is on the road you don't see that anymore and instead you see them explaining when fans don't really get why things are as they are, or they say that they wanted to do something so they did it. They are being very clear on that the book readers aren't their only viewers. As said there are more obvious explanations as to why Dany is closer to the book in this season, and it's because her arc in ASoS is much more TV friendly.I learned something about the Flapper movement now though, so thank you for that. I'm not too interested in that time period so I've missed things like that, but more knowledge is always good.Your last paragraph shows a lot of the problem. People say that they have no problem with nudity but still such scenes seem to be under different "rules" to be used than everything else. That means that they treat nudity differently and obviously there's a problem there as otherwise it would play under the same rules as everything else. People that react less to a scene with violence than nudity/sex also display a significant problem in our societies. Furthermore you're also flat out wrong when you state that HBO can't give you an episode without forcing nudity into a scene since there's been three episodes this season without any nudity at all. Apparently you don't know what you're talking about and criticism towards the show on such basis becomes pretty hollow.As for the Mel and Gendry scene, if you can't understand why she got naked there I don't know what to say. It's extremely obvious that she seduces him to make him forget his skepticism and paranoia and walk into the trap willingly. You don't have to like it though as that's not the same matter as understanding why something happens. It's not even particularly far fetched that the character that consistently dresses like a sex goddess and so often plays on sex and desire in the books behaves like this. Since Mel just seems to have sex with Stannis once in the show she's actually seemingly more moderate than her book version.
585	Lord Bronn of Sunspear	2013-05-21	The most talked about penis in westeros, do you think ramsay will come for him next? He's a very jealous boy.Har!The nudity was not necessary, but not uncalled for. Would anyone have gotten anything extra out of the scene/episode had she not been naked?That scene managed to tell quite a bit of story. Davos trying to hold back stannis, stannis thinking that hes casting a spell, when really Mel already knows that these 3 will die, but wants stannis to think that its thanks to R'llor (shit, how is that spelled? Lol)Mel seduces. Its how she gets what she wants. It was the best way to keep gendry calm. Guards holding him down would have freaked him out, whereas the way it was done, kinda put the idea in his head "what are you doing...? ...am i going to like this? /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />"That being said, if she wanted him to think we was getting laid, she had to take her clothes off. Who has sex with clothes on?Besides that, even though the scene is not in the books, they want to keep the same feel as the source. And lets face it, in that world, sexy-time is common place.I quite liked the episode. But i havnt had much bad to say about the whole season (theons stuff? All great).    Not how i pictured darrio, thought hed look more like crixus, but thats not worth complaining about. Some hair dye wouldnt have hurt, though.Agreed with what someone said earlier... The game of thrones is played between the lines, so cersei talking ti marg like that was unexpected. But since we dont get the personally thoughts on screen, there had to be someway to get her hatred across.
586	juanml82	2013-05-21	Actually, I think Danny's nipples showing over the water was more gratuitous than Mel-Gendry. While the whole getting laid stuff creates a bit of suspense (is she making another shadow baby? Is she up to something nasty? Something else?), Danny's nipples are just decoration which kind of distract from everything else going on
587	Wunhopkuendo	2013-05-21	Is she notorious for that?  Book Mel only fucks Stannis to my recollection, and there is no sex angle to the leeches on Edric Storm. I know that it doesn't even "fit" with what the show itself created because if the lamb can't see the knife because it spoils the blood then it logically follows that the leeching too must be done without any fear, so tying him up and then dropping leeches on him while he screams was definitely showing him the knife and ruining the blood.  Logic fail.Maybe I was reading too much into this, but I took the scene about the Lamb with Stannis as she intended to kill Gendry.

588	Cas Stark	2013-05-21	Maybe I was reading too much into this, but I took the scene about the Lamb with Stannis as she intended to kill Gendry. In the follow up where she seduces him, she makes a comment to Stannis regarding just using his blood instead to provide proof to Davos. Anyone else get that?What's the difference?  Either fear spoils the blood or it doesn't.If it does, then Gendry screaming in fear while being leeched is a logic fail because it doesn't make much sense that fear only taints the blood when you kill the victim...at least not to me.

In the follow up where she seduces him, she makes a comment to Stannis regarding just using his blood instead to provide proof to Davos. Anyone else get that?Yes she absolutely intended to kill him.  But Davos talked Stannis into not allowing her to do it.The implication of her Davos remark was wait until the 3 kings die... then you'll see; i.e, if a few leeches have THAT much power imagine what we can do if spill all of his blood.
592	Lady Lea	2013-05-21	They could have had her drug the wine, and then have him wake up with the leeches on him, at least it would have been consistent with what they wrote for the scene.Or, since leeches are therapeutic, she could have just made up some excuse about how he would benefit from a leeching. If fear taints the blood I feel like her tying him up and freaking the hell out of Gendry probably defeated the whole purpose.

593	PatrickStormborn	2013-05-21	As to her wolfishness, I thought it was obvious she was more Tully than wolf when she was the first to lose her direwolf. I thought that was the perfect symbol of her lack of all things Stark. I completely disagree with this assessment. As it stands, Arya is the most "Tully" of the Starks, Sansa is the most "Arryn", and Bran is the most "Stark". Just because Sansa acts like a noble lady doesn't mean she's anything like Catelyn; Arya shares most of Catelyn's traits.
594	Weeping Sore	2013-05-21	Actually, I think Danny's nipples showing over the water was more gratuitous than Mel-Gendry. While the whole getting laid stuff creates a bit of suspense (is she making another shadow baby? Is she up to something nasty? Something else?), Danny's nipples are just decoration which kind of distract from everything else going onDany's always been pretty casual about being nude, it didn't seem out of character.  Also, where is Mel from? Lys? Was she a bed-slave before she joined up with the Lord of Light? This might have been Carice Van Houten's best-acted scene to date.Which brings me to my point about the nudity. I have a lot easier time with it when it's a real actor (acting while nude), as in this episode, rather than nudes-for-hire who couldn't act their way out of a paper bag, as in the last one (Ramsay's girls).

601	Zman1863	2013-05-21	Ned acts like Jon Arryn; he does not act like a Stark. Sansa is the most like Ned.I think that's a bit of a stretch. I don't see a lot of Ned in Sansa, and even if I did it would be problematic to secondarily connect it to Jon Arryn. Ned was surely influenced by Jon Arryn, and we know that Brandon was considered to have a wildness that is in many Starks.  But that wildness is not the only Stark trait. There is also the signature coolness of temperament. Additionally, we have very little information about what Jon Arryn was like, and even less about Lord Rickard.

I have a lot easier time with it when it's a real actor (acting while nude), as in this episode, rather than nudes-for-hire who couldn't act their way out of a paper bag, as in the last one (Ramsay's girls).Mel was sold as a slave and trained in Asshai, I don't recall if she was sold in Asshai or taken there for her training. I'm under the impression she was sold as a child, but I'm not 100% sure that's backed by the text.In any event, she doesn't seem to have received prostitute training.As for Stark or Tully traits, I'm under the idea that Westeros Houses aren't Hogwarts Houses. There aren't genetic traits passed to their children, but rather education and how teenage kids take that education. In any event there are details in the snow castle chapter that point to the idea that Sansa is a northerner through and through, most notably how she opens the windows to get dressed while it's snowing inside, just like Ned did in Winterfell right before Luwin brought Catelyn that message from Lysa.
612	Khal Pono	2013-05-21	Try reading this thread if you're struggling to understand my interpretation.Sigh. I have no problem saying that Sansa is like Ned.  But saying that Ned "doesn't act like a Stark' is just silly.  Jon and Robb sure act like Ned in some ways, and they're Starks by blood.We don't *know* any Starks from Ned's generation and earlier except Benjen.  Who knows if being a "Stark" meant you were stern and honorable like Ned or hot-blooded like Lyanna and Brandon.  In the books, when Bran was in the crypts with Osha and company, he said the Stark kings had wide ranges of personalities and behaviors--some of the great, some of them awful.  There's no single set of behaviors that make someone Stark-y.The one thing that all the onscreen Starks seem to share is enormous stubbornness, though the wiser Starks can sometimes be seen to yield in their stubbornness in an attempt to save their own life or the lives of their families.Mel was sold as a slave and trained in Asshai, I don't recall if she was sold in Asshai or taken there for her training. I'm under the impression she was sold as a child, but I'm not 100% sure that's backed by the text.In any event, she doesn't seem to have received prostitute training.It's interesting to speculate about how/why Mel is so good in bed.  Even in the books, she tells Davos that she will rock his world if she lets her in his bedroom one night.   I tend to think it's that she was sexualized at a very early age--and probably abused in the temples.   Victims of sexual abuse can sometimes follow two very common paths (there are of course, many exceptions who don't follow either--especially those who get treatment); one, they can grow up to be frigid and traumatized about sex, or they can grow up to be hyper-sexual and are constantly using their sexuality to manipulate others or to feel better about themselves.

614	Maester Murks	2013-05-21	I'm not sure why he screamed, actually. From what I have heard leeches produce a numbing agent in their saliva, which is why when you're wading through their natural habitat you often don't feel them attaching to you. But I'll have to google to confirm.I can confirm that by personal experience. You don't feel them biting at all. Well, at least that's true, if they bite on your ankles, legs or torso. Can't speak for other, more sensitive areas /uhoh.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':uhoh:' />

617	Ampris	2013-05-21	Nah, she just isn't a powerful wizard in training like her siblings. As for brains, it looks like Jon is the exception there. Starks are rather dimwittedWhat? Putting honor before intelligence doesn't make them dimwitted. Robb quite obviously had a good mind for strategy, winning all his battles against TYWIN. You don't do that by being dimwitted.Ned figured out the truth about Cersei's children. In the show he had a lot of help from LF for that but in the book he dug a lot more on his own. Not to mention his success in supporting one rebellion and defeating another.Arya continuously gets out of messes. Weasel Soup is a good example of her using her brain.Sansa is truly naive, I have no argument against that. But at least by the time she is in the Vale she starts to learn SOMETHING. The show has dumbed her down even more than the books.Benjen wouldn't get to be first ranger by being stupid.Bran and Rickon are for the most part still too young to really make a determination. Though honestly the whole dreaming of Ned in the crypts and therefore knowing he was killed is a complicated deduction to make for a child.

The bit with Theon is harder - Robb trusts Theon, but has no reason to trust Balon, so keeping Theon is still the smart thing to do.Loras Tyrell asked Ned to go after the Mountain, which would have put Tyrells against Lannisters, yet Ned decided against it for rather silly reasons, and send an incredibly small force to deal with the Lannister's armies. Granted, he was in pain and sitting in the less ergonomical chair ever invented, but still.As for Arya, let's take a look at this:Incredibly good wizard assassin who's expensive enough the Small Council doesn't think they can afford to hire: Hey girl, you've saved my life, so I'll give you three free deathsArya: Free? Seriously?Jaquen: YepArya: Great! Tywin Lannister, Joffrey Baratheon and Stannis Baratheon! King of the North FTW!

But there is no reason to think that Cat and Lyanna were much like either.Sansa is probably more like Ned than Arya is, though.Not sure that any of the kids are particularly "Tully-like", based on what we know of the Tullys. And that's probably not suprising. The Stark kids grew up in the North in Winterfell, which has completely diferent sensibilities than the Riverlands. Cat was a fish out of water there, but the kids all are a part of it.None of them are much like Edmure, the Blackfish, Lysa, or Cat

Sansa is NOTHING like Catelyn, apart from the fact that she acts like a Lady.ive read that thread and Arya has traits of Cat over Ned, LyAnna over Cat stc.  She's her own character.  Arya is a survivor over anything and everything.  That is not Cat.  Arya and duty and honor?   I dont fucking think so.  Family yes.
625	Cas Stark	2013-05-21	I didn't think it was very ambiguious that Arya Stark had the same wild 'wolf blood' streak that Lyanna and Brandon Stark had....her father says as much, and then there is her resemblance in termperment and skill set to Lyanna Stark as well.
I know Sansa fans like to think she is a Starky Stark, but that's a reach.
626	silentwanderer	2013-05-21	At least I know now that they're going to have to split the book into two seasons, which is probably for the best, content-wise.Its too long to deal with otherwise.Plus, the story could always be split into "before the wildlings hit Castle Black " and "after the wildlings hit Castle Black".After all, neither Mance nor Stannis are in position for what should be their greatest battle; the first is MIA and the second is still using leeches to bleed out his nephew in this episode.

Cat was a fish out of water there, but the kids all are a part of it.None of them are much like Edmure, the Blackfish, Lysa, or CatYes, Arya is definitely very Starkish since she's so closely compared to Lyanna. I don't think Sansa is much Arryn either. I think she's closer to her mother but also so young and spoiled that she hasn't learned all the good traits yet. If they had kept on living in Winterfell I think she would have been molded into a new Cat (as close as children get, as everyone is of course always their own person). All the things she likes are things that Ned doesn't see too much value in so it seems weird to say that she's mainly taking after him. I think he's a big part of why she's spoiled, while she most likely learns a lot more from Cat, which is how it should be as she's supposed to learn how to be a lady and she is pretty good at that (unlike Arya, who is even more spoiled).
628	juanml82	2013-05-21	I think Sansa got the education we believe her mother wanted for her lady girl, but she certainly didn't get her rashness and character.
I think Ned and Cat molded her into what they believed a proper southron lady should be, but Cat is not a 'proper' southron lady. She doesn't formally greet Tyrion at the Crossroads Inn, nor does any 'ladylike' stuff. Instead, she acts as a Lord Paramount.

632	Ginevra	2013-05-21	I noticed that too, but so far, none of my friends who hasn't read the books has commented about it. They either didn't pay attention or they simply thought it will be stopped at time. As a viewer, it's a bit shocking to find out they simply will kill two of the main protagonists so far, Joffrey and Robb.(maybe, they think that Gendry's blood isn't "good" and it won't work).Yeah, we see red herrings in literature and TV so often, especially with dramas, we have grown immune.  Each and every week, it seems like this might really be it for The Doctor, or for Gaius Baltar, or for Carrie Mathison, but these hardly even phase us because we know they will not be killing off our heroes and their stars.  Those of us who've read the books know that this obviously wasn't the case with GRRM, but I don't think we knew that until after the middle of Book 3, or at least I didn't.  I thought Eddard was some kind of fluke.  After we lose so many at the Red Wedding, and then Joffrey, and then Tywin, it's obvious that GRRM has no qualms in destroying his beautifully drawn characters.
633	Ginevra	2013-05-21	I completely disagree with this assessment. As it stands, Arya is the most "Tully" of the Starks, Sansa is the most "Arryn", and Bran is the most "Stark". Just because Sansa acts like a noble lady doesn't mean she's anything like Catelyn; Arya shares most of Catelyn's traits.Khal Pono brings up a good point about the Arryns, but I've always thought of Jon and Arya as at least looking the most Stark-like and Sansa looking the most Tully-like.  I know looks don't equate to character, but there are other similarities, too, such as Sansa's preferences for warmer weather and being excited to leave the North behind and join the South.With Arya, I've always remembered her being so closely compared to Lyanna Stark, and here are some quotes from the Wiki that support what my impression from the books.Ned refers to [Lyanna], like their brother Brandon, as "wolf-blooded" - headstrong, willful, courageous and hot-tempered. He goes on to compare her to his tomboyish daughter Arya in both appearance and personality, adding that Lyanna probably would have carried a sword if their father had allowed it. She is noted to have been an extremely skilled rider.[2] ...Lyanna rode horses like a northman. Harwin compares her riding skills to those of Arya Stark. [4]--http://awoiaf.wester...hp/Lyanna_Stark
634	Ginevra	2013-05-21	Ned acts like Jon Arryn; he does not act like a Stark. Sansa is the most like Ned.Patrick, I know that Ned and Jon Arryn were friends, but I am extremely curious as to why you would think that 1.) Ned isn't Stark-like, and that 2.) Sansa is more like Ned than any of the others.  I cannot imagine what you will say, but I am curious.  If Ned isn't Stark-like, who is?  And from whom did this person learn to be like a Stark?ETA:  I have read a lot of the Sansa's like Ned and Arya's like Cat debate, and I must say that Cat and Arya do have a lot of similarities.  And yet, I still see Arya as more Stark-like because we are told so much about how she's like Lyanna and because she seems stark enough to survive the North, even being significantly younger than Sansa.  I can also see how Sansa in many ways resembles Ned, but I wouldn't say she resembled her father the most of all the siblings - or anywhere close.  But I am open to hearing discussion.

Granted, he was in pain and sitting in the less ergonomical chair ever invented, but still.As for Arya, let's take a look at this:Incredibly good wizard assassin who's expensive enough the Small Council doesn't think they can afford to hire: Hey girl, you've saved my life, so I'll give you three free deathsArya: Free? Seriously?Jaquen: YepArya: Great! Tywin Lannister, Joffrey Baratheon and Stannis Baratheon! King of the North FTW!Making bad decisions isn't the same as being dimwitted. And seriously, Arya was what, 10 at that point? She was concerned with getting back to her family and surviving. Yeah in hindsight she could have chosen differently, but that doesn't make her dimwitted. As for Robb/Theon - my understanding was that Robb really did think of Theon as a brother. Who really suspects their brother will betray them?

Can't speak for other, more sensitive areas /uhoh.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':uhoh:' />Well leeches may gross people out.  Chett didnt like them.
638	rmholt	2013-05-22	Old, wise, honorable, boring (To Lysa, but can't be entirely for Robert to love him). I guess that's the extent of what we know of him. It's a bit of a reach really to compare people to him.Jon Arryn fostered Robert and Ned so it was more than a friendship. Clearly there was more to him than Lysa saw.

654	7V3N	2013-05-23	snipAs for the Mel and Gendry scene, if you can't understand why she got naked there I don't know what to say. It's extremely obvious that she seduces him to make him forget his skepticism and paranoia and walk into the trap willingly. You don't have to like it though as that's not the same matter as understanding why something happens. It's not even particularly far fetched that the character that consistently dresses like a sex goddess and so often plays on sex and desire in the books behaves like this. Since Mel just seems to have sex with Stannis once in the show she's actually seemingly more moderate than her book version.For the rest, we must agree to disagree. I would have preferred you not make things personal, however.But the Mel-Gendry sex scene was pointless. Mel had NO reason to get naked and hop on his dick. NONE AT ALL. She doesn't want him to "see the blade"? How about tying him up in his sleep? There are plenty of alternate methods that would make more sense. I would love to hear your explanation for why it was necessary for Melisandre to have sex with Gendry.

I would love to hear your explanation for why it was necessary for Melisandre to have sex with Gendry.Jumping in where I probably shouldn't: there could easily have been a reason: make it something like the magic requires the blood of an aroused man, or whatever. That would have been kind of stupid, but at least it would have been consistent.But instead they had to insist that the lamb couldn't see the blade, so she tied him up, and utterly terrified him, which was ... exactly what she earlier said she wanted to avoid. Logically it just makes no sense. Imagine instead: "Look you brave strong man, here's [whispers in the ear] what I'll do for you if you just let these three leeches briefly suck on your blood." Problem solved, and lamb feeling macho rather than terrified (I mean, maybe Westeros has super leeches or something, but come on - leeches?! They're almost painless, albeit a bit disgusting!). At least then the clumsily inserted sex scene would have made sense for the story.
656	Curethan	2013-05-23	Y'know, sexual arousal does cause capillary dillation - perhaps enabling the leechs to get 'hot' blood is important?
She did drop one right onto his penis after all.
Just saying...

658	Maxthestig	2013-05-23	http://squarevision....nd-sons-review/Here is my review.I think it is better on a re-watch. The wedding was great, did the book justice. But the Sam part didn't in my eyes. It was good but not as good as the books !
659	Cruella	2013-05-23	I didn't like this scene because it was nonsensical. Melisandre didn't get his sperm from this because I am pretty sure he hadn't finished. (if she fucked him to get shadowbaby it would be perfectly ok). If she didn't want to scare him, then she acted as stupidly as she possibly could. Leeches are normal medicine practice now and especially back then. If she told him that she knows medicine and he needs a little leeching, he'd shrug and let her, as is, she made sure he'd be as terrified as possible after stating that she wants to achieve exact opposite. Maybe she could fuck him before convincing him to try leeches, that would make some sense at least. And by the time they'll presumably consider burning him alive, no amount of boobies will soothe the lamb anyway.
From non-spoiled comments, other people were confused as well. the show is confusing enough, sometimes in all the wrong ways, without this bizarreness.
660	DaveSnow House Stark	2013-05-23	I have to agree somewhat. There was no need for her to get naked. She could've stayed clothed and still got him aroused and tied up. Now, that said, I REALLY enjoyed her in the scene!!
661	silentwanderer	2013-05-23	Jumping in where I probably shouldn't: there could easily have been a reason: make it something like the magic requires the blood of an aroused man, or whatever.Considering the last time Melisandre produced "a son" for Stannis she had to  arouse him too, I think you have a point.She also made the point her magic couldn't work on Stannis anymore because his fires "burn low".It doesn't seem to work unless the subject is aroused in one way or another.

Sex by someone with neither desire nor reason to do it is just stupid.So is letting people get up close to the Mother of Dragons and not guarding her tent.So is sneaking into her tent at night and threatening her maid when you could just ask to see her.I could go on.

665	silentwanderer	2013-05-23	I think the Mother of Dragons was self explanatory: Daario entered her tent dressed in an Unsullied uniform.
Not only they are eunich, the show established the Unsullied were fiercely loyal to the Khalessi in the scene with Daario's Captains.

667	silentwanderer	2013-05-23	He brought two heads of people he fought side by side with just to prove a point.
As much as I'd want to believe no Unsullied was harmed in the recollection of that uniform, I don't think that was the case.

He is young but he may not have finished however.  So...I dunno.  Anyway, if he is like young men I have known getting him in that situation would have made it pretty easy to tie him up.He brought two heads of people he fought side by side with just to prove a point.As much as I'd want to believe no Unsullied was harmed in the recollection of that uniform, I don't think that was the case.Perhaps there was some in the company steel.  These arent the only unsullied - in fact there are unsullied everywhere - they just arent all the temper of the ones Dany has.  The uniform is included in the price.I'm telling you....Ashton Kuschter would have been a perfect Daario  /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />Um...no.The only thing is though, is how is show Sam "Sam the Slayer" when there was no one but Gilly to witness it?WTH does that mean?  I imagine she could describe it pretty well.It's done as a cliffhanger in the book anyway. Its just a bit more of one.In the book the wights come with the Other - as expected in the typical Other army. However this Other came alone.  Coldhands came to save them from the wights.  There are no wights.  OK there could have been wights AND Coldhands. Or they might do it completely differently.

But yes, it's the sort of thing I'd think Dany should probably have asked about.That's a good scenario, but....In the book, she had asked them (as in the show) to come back with a decision.Daario could have been escorted to her tent as in book , probably by Jorah , Melisande could have been intermediary , Jorah would have objected to seeing Daario alone, but Dany overruled him (she does not mind irritating him), she could have been in her bath. The disguise and threat to Missandei was an awkward dramatic construct.
674	Ran	2013-05-24	This is absolutely true. He could have marched up to purposefully be discovered and brought to her or whatever.
I would explain this away as another example of him showing off, by showing that he had the power to kill Daenerys in his hands, that he's skilled and capable enough to infiltirate her camp and her tent. It seems to fit the character, but on the other hand, obviously it was intended by the writers to create some doubt and uncertainty.
675	Master Forel's Fro	2013-05-24	Plus it's been so long sinse we saw naked Dany, was it the end of season 1? I can't remember, now that I think about it we needed that dose of Dany nude to remember why we watch the show.

It's one thing to look like someone else, but another to actually use the same actor. Viewers would be wondering if he was a twin, or if this was days of our lives.As for sneaking up on Dany, well that was also done for the viewers' benefit. The last scene we see is the three of them discussing who was going to sneak up on the tent and kill her. Then we see him sneaking up on the tent and what appears to be trying to kill her. The audience gets nervous, but then excited that Dany has a new (and good looking) ally as well as what, 8000 soldiers? Yay! Happy television for all.

Look at her dealings with Ned, her heavy-handed interactions with Sansa during Blackwater, and pretty much everything she does in AFFC leading up to her walk of shame. The point I think was being made was that Cersei thinks she is clever and subtle, but she is anything but.

Seeing how the Blackfish is on route to the Red Wedding, do you fellow viewers think they will allow him to be killed? He holds River Run until Jamie convinces him to surrender. He escapes during the night before they enter the castle, which leads me to believe that Martin has more in store for the uncle of Catlyn Stark. Due to the changing of certain story lines I'm wondering if this will alter Martin's original direction, and flip the unfinished books completely.

I think it goes the same with the books. He will not change anything important. He has said that TV!Osha is more interesting than his own (though this season she is a pain) and that he may write more with her (or something along those lines). I don't think it is altering anything in the world (places, characters, events, etc.). Instead, it changes how he writes, not what he writes.

690	DarkWingsDarkWords	2013-05-24	Sorry this is off topic. One thing I noticed that Martin wrote about that hasn't been mentioned is Rob dispatching a force North to prepare for the liberation of the North, pending Walder Freys alliance. Maege Mormont, Glover, and I think two other Lords under his banner. Their whereabouts after the Red Wedding are unknown. Where do you think Martin will go with this sizeable, yet forgotten force? Most of Rob's banner men went with Lord Bolton, however none of the dispatched forces have been mentioned as folding in with the rest. Maybe I have over looked something, please let me know what you all think.
691	morgan1028	2013-05-24	The Blackfish can NOT be killed off.  Just please no.  We will only be left with Edmure, and I do like him, even with his soft heart and head... esp.his soft heart.  UnCat doesn't really count as Tully or Stark.. she is in her own category:  Revenge.  This is just my wish,  he escapes the twins ( w/o Talisa)!  The guy is a strong swimmer and even a blackfish can swim dammit.  Or he never goes and holes up in Riverrun as per books, so he can have his epic put down rolling his eyes and distainful mockery of Jaime.  I like Jaime too, but the Blackfish owned him in that conversation.  Please don't kill him, no Great or Small Jon.  No Dacey...
692	Dio Forel	2013-05-24	Why do a bunch of people think that Sansa noticed Joffrey moving the stool and thus realized Tyrion couldn't reach? As stupid as they've made showSansa, she could have been completely unaware.Because she did notice... she reacted... and the stool was moved audibly.  She noticed... and thats why I keep saying to people it is akin to not kneeling... She knew the stool was moved & he couldnt reach,  heard the laughter... and only acknowledged it reluctantly when Tyrion pleaded for her to kneel.
693	rmholt	2013-05-24	I haven't read through all the threads, so I'm not sure if anybody has posted this question. Seeing how the Blackfish is on route to the Red Wedding, do you fellow viewers think they will allow him to be killed? He holds River Run until Jamie convinces him to surrender. He escapes during the night before they enter the castle, which leads me to believe that Martin has more in store for the uncle of Catlyn Stark. Due to the changing of certain story lines I'm wondering if this will alter Martin's original direction, and flip the unfinished books completely.If Blackfish is killed in the show that is sort of a spoiler for the books. So I predict either we know he survives or we dont know. So far the only effect the show has had on GRRM is for him to see more potential in Osha as a book character
694	Dio Forel	2013-05-24	I'm not 'uncomfortable' with it, I think sex and nudity is fine on screen. The complaints about sex typically aren't about how inappropriate the sex was, they're about how you shouldn't just fill a show with sex that doesn't serve the plot. If a sex scene is completely unnecessary, I would prefer it to be replaced by something that actually advances the plot or comes from the books.The sex scene was necessary in this episode...Gendry is diligent,  intelligent & responsible.  But he is also a bastard that has spent his time making weapons.... on the run & having slight feelings towards Arya.  Obviously a clear way for showMelisandre to put him in a vulnerable position is by means of sexual contact.  This isnt the books,  its HBO.  How is this not expected?

When it's on HBO you get good productive values and good performances ... and sex and nudity whenever possible. I don't care as long as it has a point.  The Gendry scene moved the plot, if marginally. The Theon scene last episode didn't.

Then he could get ransomed or escape in a future season so he can fulfill his Blackfish destiny as laid out in the books.

The Gendry scene moved the plot, if marginally. The Theon scene last episode didn't.I disagree.  Now that Theon has been completely broken (and that last episode was required) we can move on with  him.  The sex scenes in the brothels for instance were not necessary - but the scene with Gendry was IMHO appropriate.

So they cant kill him now in the show or it's a spoiler.
699	7V3N	2013-05-25	"Necessary" is not the right word. I think you mean acceptable. Unless we see a Gendry shadow-baby, it was not necessary. I would say it was necessary if Mel snuck the leaches on after Gendry had the post-climax sleepies. But she contradicted her whole thing about not scaring him. He was clearly freaking out. I enjoyed seeing the actress nude as much as the next guy, but as far as plot significance, it had none and actually contradicted material said earlier in the episode.
700	Noxie	2013-05-25	Regarding the Blackfish, is this the time to point out Martin said D&D are actually killing off more people than the books did?

The Gendry scene moved the plot, if marginally. The Theon scene last episode didn't. I think the Theon sex scene was just to point out the kind of torture the bastard of Bolton put him through. The scene was great at establishing what kind of twisted individual that Ramsay really is.
702	rmholt	2013-05-25	Regarding the Blackfish, is this the time to point out Martin said D&D are actually killing off more people than the books did?They do check with him before killing someone off.  So if they kill a character, eg Blackfish, it isnt vital to the story.  So I guess they could kill him off even if he isnt dead in the books.
703	madprofessah	2013-05-25	The writers also messed up Sansa's age. She's not 14, not in the show, she's got to be at least 16.Remember Sansa is 4 years older than Bran, Bran was 10 (in the show) when the story started, a it's been at least 2 years since season 1 started.  Bran is 12 now and Arya is 14, Sansa should be 16.I was wondering about this... I thought it was pretty bizarre that they had Sansa say she was 14 since the actress playing her doesn't remotely look 14 and it would truly skeeve the majority of non-perv viewers. Even 16 is pretty young to be bedded. How old is Show Margaery and Show Cersei?

(For the audience's benefit.)Why mention her age at all? It's awkward , as noted, in the book, as I read it, no matter her age, he was going to leave her alone and he did.Lord if this show goes 4 more years  the Stark kids, who not longer look like kids, will not only be young adults but look like young adults. Sophie Turner has for a long long time now.

The scene was great at establishing what kind of twisted individual that Ramsay really is.Not to mention, they killed Ros (Theon's emotional attachment on season 1 ) the same episode Ramsay physically mutilates him.The character may never know it, but I can see what the writers did here.

707	The King Breaker	2013-05-26	regarding the blackfish why would they introduce him just to kill him off hes not massively relevant to the plot of the show (at this point) . about the sex scene people say its not necessary because it doesn't bring the plot along are well wrong! it might not be relevant but its entertaining it pushes boundaries and makes the show stand out . i mean in the blackwater episode when that guy gets a rock dropped on his head that didnt develop the plot but it was still fun dont deny it. in my personal view i was enjoying the episode until mel starts to move that last leach and the my thoughts where no... no...no..what are you doing... please dont...no (que shudder)

Anyone surprised/disappointed by this? Season 3 had a lot of hype, and many expected it to be the best season yet. I thought it might be, but overall I was always anxious for season 4. Yes, we will get that very iconic scene in one week's time, however, IMO the second half of a Storm of Swords is better than the first half. Season 4 will have so much: purple wedding, battle at the wall, red viper vs. the mountain, Tyrion's escape/revenge, etc. What do you guys think?

In Season 3 we have had 3 great episodes (S3E03, S3E04, S3E05) which I would probably rate as 10 and 2 very good episodes (S3E06 and S3E08) which I would rate as 9s. I suspect that the last two episodes will be at least 9s, if not both 10s. That would mean half of Season 3 would have been rated 10.Where are the average ratings at ASOIAF for all the episodes and seasons? Anyone do the math yet?I do think it is possible that Season 4 could be the best ever. I do know that one of the most satisfying moments in my reading of the books was the line "It turns out that Tywin Lannister did not indeed shit gold" (or words to that effect). The Purple Wedding is pretty satisfying too. The stuff at the Vale is sorta diffuse, but my memory is not that great--I have only read the books once so I can only really remember the big events right now.

Even 16 is pretty young to be bedded. How old is Show Margaery and Show Cersei?I think at least one year got lost in oblivion by Sansa telling she was fourteen. She started at Winterfell at the age of thirteen. Only a few months between the party at Wnterfell and the wedding?? Tyrion travelling to the Wall and being taken to the Eyrie in the speed of light? All that war, Blackwater, Robb's an Catelyn's trip to Riverrun, Dany's baby must have taken nine months at the first season before the dragons even hatched - and now they are quite big.The timing is wrong!No, I think they made a huge mistake, they aged up all kids, they should not have forgotten Sansa. She looks as if they could have taken an eighteen year old actress from the beginning for her role. Why did they bother with a minor if Sophie Turner looked like eighteen from the first season on? They could easily have found an eighteen year old who looks like fourteen and plays a thirteen year old. What do you think? I would like to know what the HBO, not the book character ages might be.
719	David Selig	2013-05-27	I don't get the big deal with Sansa's age. Far bigger discrepancies between the actor's age and the character's age happen in TV land all the time. So she looks 17 and is supposed to be 14, big deal. We have actors in their late 20s and looking it being cast as teens quite often in other shows. Or in this show too - Richard Madden is way older than 17-18.I think at least one year got lost in oblivion by Sansa telling she was fourteen. She started at Winterfell at the age of thirteen.

If Sansa was 13 years and 1 month back at the start, and is 14 years and 11 months now, it's full 22 months between the two events.

							Edited by David Selig, 27 May 2013 - 10:50 AM.
720	PatrickStormborn	2013-05-27	We can roughly assume that the time period covered by the show so far is 1 year and 9 months (give or take), as Dany said that a year ago she had no dragons, and the first episode took place 9-10 months before the birth of the dragons.
It would therefore be entirely possible for Sansa to have been 13 when Robert arrived at Winterfell and 14 when she marries Tyrion. The timing would also be consistent with the books, as she was 11 when Robert arrived at Winterfell and 12 when she married Tyrion.
721	Woman of War	2013-05-27	Maybe it's Sophie Turner's looks that adds to my doubts. She simply looks like an adult young woman with shoulders that would make her the perfect athlete. (not demeaning, I have been a track and field athlete myself, only not really Sansa imo, she should be more the Venetian Renaissance beauty)
722	ebevan91	2013-05-27	She would have to be almost 15. In fact I bet by next season she will be 15.

Then subtract for the real variability.  Then you'd have to get their personal automatic number etc etc etc.  Probably <G> not worth it.  But there could be more variability in "like" than the numbers show.Nevertheless interesting that the despised episodes werent all that despised.  unless a lot of people give an automatic 7.  I guess there is something in each episode that redeems it.  Blackwater gets a 10 from me every time I see it.  I have already resigned myself to the fact that nothing will beat it, just as I never was stunned by a death the way Lady's and Ned's did me.
726	JMJ	2013-05-27	We all get worked up about Sansa's age in the show, my guess because it's a young girl's role. It's possibly more incredulous that Kit Harington plays a fourteen year old Jon Snow in S1, and similarly 14 year old Robb is played by Madden. The difference I see is that on the show, they have not really made a big deal pointing out Robb and Jon's ages, whilst in S3:E8 they had to bring up Sansa's age due to her marriage to Tyrion, and previously when she first started having menses.
So, my point is, for the show, we're supposed to think that Jon and Robb are 5+ years older than Sansa?
727	Weeping Sore	2013-05-27	She would have to be almost 15. In fact I bet by next season she will be 15.If they were going to have her age explicitly stated, they should have just said 15- slightly more believable, and still too young for Tyrion.

Season 4 will have so much: purple wedding, battle at the wall, red viper vs. the mountain, Tyrion's escape/revenge, etc. What do you guys think?I've gotta say I do still favor the first season. They cut a lot of the history but they hit the culture perfectly (I think). By the end of the season, you understand what everyone's story is about, what each main character (that had been introduced) was like in the first book, and Mark Addy was just exceptional as King Robert. Also, and I know this is a point of contention here, but the nudity was less intrusive -- we usually got it through whores in brothels, or Dany with Drogo. The nudity did not seem to change scenes, where now it seems that they go into the writers room thinking "how could we do this, but with her naked."The second season I hated almost every episode of it because it seemed to lack all the details that GRRM avoided. GRRM commented on how silly it is in LOTR where the heroes wear no helms, and never seem to get hit like the common soldiers. But then they butcher his Blackwater episode by having Stannis literally lead the charge without any sort of protection (via shield or helm). And when he gets to the walls, a rock is dropped on the head of the guy next to him. Remember how Jaime cut through men because he knew if he killed Robb Stark, the Starks lose? Every Lannister soldier would be targetting Stannis. GRRM wrote Stannis commanding the battle from a war tent, and it should have stayed that way. Add in the complete butchery of Dany's story. If it weren't for the great acting for Bran, Theon, and Arya the second season would have been unwatchable for me. Arya's story was kept well, as was Theon's, but both ended poorly and abruptly IMO. Also, Stannis' story was weak but they got a perfect actor for Davos.The third season has been quite good. I like how the adaptations seem to make more sense. I think they went too hard on the torture scenes (these could have been quick openers), and I do not like the forced nudity (as I have said), but the characters seem more true. Stannis and Davos' interactions have been great, and I have finally seen what I saw in Book!Stannis. I think they have done a poor job really explaining Robb's story and I hate that they aren't using Jeyne (the way they did it makes me lose all respect for TV!Robb). Dany's story has been great, and NCW has been amazing as Jaime (as he been since the start, but he has done a great job at revealing what Jaime really is, like in the books), and I feel Brienne has been redeemed this season from her season 2 whatever (killing people slowly, looking like she enjoyed it). Bran's story has been a shame this season. Rather than giving us all the good introduction to warging and greenseer magic, we have Osha bickering about how she doesn't trust the crannogmen. Jon's story only had one good scene (which GRRM wrote). They haven't hit the culture of the wildings right. They just seem like the mountain clans, but colder and in much worse living conditions.All in all, season three has brought back the enjoyment that the show gave me in the first season. I actually consider it an adaptation of my favorite book series. Season two made me consider giving up on the show, and I don't even count it as an adaptation because it was the writers making the series what they thought would be cool. Season three has redeemed my interest and made me look forward to each episode. They crushed my heart (in the bad way) with Blackwater last season. I just hope they made the Red Wedding was heartbreaking (in the sorta good way) as it was when I read it (thought it'll be hard since they made sure I dislike TV!Robb).

729	TheWhiteRabbit	2013-05-27	I agree--season 1 is probably still my favorite. I guess it's a little premature though. Bran's storyline has been butchered. They definitely could have explained the warging/greenseeing more up to this point. They also could have included Meera telling the Knight of the Laughing Tree story. I wasn't too upset about the changes made to the brotherhood without banners because I never cared for them much in the book anyway. However, I will reserve complete judgement and comparison until the season ends. Can't wait for next week! /cool4.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':cool4:' />
730	silentwanderer	2013-05-27	I think this season has been more interesting in terms of switches and changes from the books.
I like what they have done with the new Gendry story as well as Arya & the Hound's old story.
What they are doing with the new Shae and Tyrion story as well as the the old Second Sons story.

731	7V3N	2013-05-27	Ah I forgot to say that my first impression of Daario in the show is more likeable than book Daario. Nothing to do with looks - I just couldn't see why anyone would fall for Book!Daario. TV!Daario has that same arrogance but with more charm.
732	yushkevsh	2013-05-27	I know it would be a big departure from the books but is it possible the climatic scene(s) in the last episode will be Robb, Aeron and Joffrey all dying? Picture the hits in the Godfather II, a montage of events all taking place essentially at the same time - with dramatic music of course. 
After seeing Stannis curse each of them it would seem odd to stretch out their deaths into the next season. People here have been saying over and over that certain events can't happen before others, etc. but that's assuming things play out like the books. And who says Joff has to be poisoned at a wedding, for example? This season we've already seen some big departures from ASoIaF so I'd say anything is possible.
733	boojam	2013-05-27	We all get worked up about Sansa's age in the show, my guess because it's a young girl's role. It's possibly more incredulous that Kit Harington plays a fourteen year old Jon Snow in S1, and similarly 14 year old Robb is played by Madden. The difference I see is that on the show, they have not really made a big deal pointing out Robb and Jon's ages, whilst in S3:E8 they had to bring up Sansa's age due to her marriage to Tyrion, and previously when she first started having menses.So, my point is, for the show, we're supposed to think that Jon and Robb are 5+ years older than Sansa?As has been said , about a 1000 times, George patterned his world , mostly after medieval Europe, tho it could apply to any historical time even into the 20th century (and even now!). It's not something we are used to in the modern world in developed countries (at least legally). No such things as 'teenagers' ... blah, blah, blah....It's obvious , even if you did not know the law, that all the 'kids' had to be aged up...I don't understand why D&D had the question asked even ...A very awkward dialog blunder... they just did not think it through.

At least not Joff. It is too great of a scene/episode to have next season. Plus him dying would have the butterfly effect. I think it would be great to begin next season with Balon's death.

Clearly Jon and Robb are much older on the show. This for book readers adds more disparity than if D+D had just decided to let Sansa be 17 or 18 in the show.
736	David Selig	2013-05-27	Jon and Robb were 17 in the first season of the show.
737	silentwanderer	2013-05-27	Jon and Robb were 17 in the first season of the show.Exactly, Robb just looks older, but he's supposed to be about the same age as Joffrey is on the show.

738	JMJ	2013-05-27	Jon and Robb were 17 in the first season of the show.So they were aged-up 4 years, whilst Sansa was kept more or less at her book age...
739	7V3N	2013-05-27	So they were aged-up 4 years, whilst Sansa was kept more or less at her book age...I think it was simply a mistake. They probably said "We need to emphasize that Sansa is so young compared to Tyrion. Somebody check the wiki for her age." The inattention to detail has always been a problem of the series.
740	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2013-05-27	I think it was simply a mistake. They probably said "We need to emphasize that Sansa is so young compared to Tyrion. Somebody check the wiki for her age." The inattention to detail has always been a problem of the series.They had Tyrion really beating home the idea of her youth to Bronn. I don't even know why they made her a specific age.
741	juanml82	2013-05-27	So people would say "Noooo... she's too young to loose her virginity with a guy she loaths"
Had it been stated earlier in the season, it could have worked as a "ohhhh.... so that's why she's so dumb!"
742	The Boar of Gore	2013-05-27	I've gotta say I do still favor the first season.One of the reasons Season 1 is so great is the same reason that Book 1 is so great. You have a team to get behind and they're in a war, with lots of fighting going on. Sansa gets a lot of hate because she doesn't seem to be doing anything to help the team - in fact, she's a liability. Later on, Cat gets hate for hurting her team, and even Robb gets hate after kiboshing a certain marriage alliance that was important to the team.Season 2 still has a lot of fighting and a lot of Tyrion - who is interesting partly for comic relief value, and partly for the fact that we know him being in power would be a good thing for our team. However, it's not as good as Season 1 because most of the fighting takes place between Stannis and the Lannisters, and no one really supports team Stannis - except insofar as what he does affects our team.Season 3 doesn't have as much fighting and both the war and our team seem to recede into the background, It has a lot more of Daenerys, who was always kind of our second team, and Jon, who is on our team but isn't really in the war - or at least not until the Others start doing something. It still has a lot of characters and intrigue going on and that was always interesting - but that was never really our main concern, again except insofar as it affected our team. By this point, just as in the books, we're moving away from the thrill of feeling as if you have a stake in this war, to the still-interesting but less immediate feeling of reading about war and politics in history. After the RW, Stark loyalists, like myself, read on - and view on - to see how the Greater War between Ice and Fire pans out, and in the hope of vengeance (for our butchered lords, for our murdered princes - vengeance!).

I was speaking specifically about the show.
744	boojam	2013-05-28	It might be interesting to poll how many people give an automatic number just because it's GoT!!  Then subtract for the real variability.  Then you'd have to get their personal automatic number etc etc etc.  Probably <G> not worth it.  But there could be more variability in "like" than the numbers show.It would be interesting to know how many trolls and sour-grapers are represented in those polls.When you have millions who watch the show and never take part of a GOT forum there is going to be a bias that is hard to correct for.

The inattention to detail has always been a problem of the series.As I have expressed many times before, I think D&D need someone else beside Bryan as a script 'nurse' (since George seems, now, to be involved in only in a minimal way (well he does have two novels to write!).D&D have created their own Martin World that 'shadows' GRRM's, that is ok with me, but here and there internal logic fails because of lack of attention to detail, or maybe it's just neglect, since D&D are definitely smart guys.
746	David Selig	2013-05-28	So they were aged-up 4 years, whilst Sansa was kept more or less at her book age...They were aged up 3 years, Sansa was aged up 2 years. So no big deal at all.
747	madprofessah	2013-05-28	I can't believe I just did this. I went through every episode rating thread on this website for seasons 1 and 2, and did the math. I think the math is right but I did this at midnight so there's no guarantees.Rounded to nearest tenth:Season 1:Winter is Coming 8.3The Kingsroad 8.2Lord Snow 7.9Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things 7.7The Wolf and the Lion 8.7A Golden Crown 8.8You Win or You Die 8.1The Pointy End 9.0Baelor 8.7Fire and Blood 9.1Season Average: 8.5Season 2:The North Remembers 7.6The Night Lands 7.1What Is Dead May Never Die 8.6Garden of Bones 7.7The Ghost of Harrenhal 8.3The Old Gods and the New 8.1A Man Without Honor 7.9The Prince of Winterfell 7.1Blackwater 9.5Valar Morghulis 7.6Season Average: 8.0I may do season 3 tomorrow, or wait until all 10 episodes have aired.Thanks so much for doing this! I see that someone else has gone ahead and done Season 3 episodes and through 8 it is averaging 8.05 (just slightly above Season 2) but well below Season 1. There is almost no way that Season 3 could end up averaging better than Season 1 at this point, but it looks like it will end up higher than Season 2.Here are those Season 3 averages so far (I haven't figured out multiquote yet)I got your back bro. No guarantee regarding the math, but I'm guessing it's accurate.Season 3 :Valar Dohaeris 7.6Dark Wings, Dark Words 7.6Walk of Punishment 8.4And Now His Watch Is Ended 9.2Kissed by Fire 8.8The Climb 7.3The Bear and the Maiden Fair 7.1Second Sons 8.4Season Average  : 8.05What's interesting about this data is that even though Season 2 is the lowest, it has the highest rated episode of all time (9.5 for Blackwater, unsurprisingly). From the description of S3E09 I don't think "The Rains of Castermere" is going to approach that level of uniformly positive fan response. Someone early posted about the possibility that Season 4 may actually out-do Season 3 and I think it is a distinct possibility.Another thing that I notice about Season 3 ratings is that they often gibe with how I rate the episodes, also! To me it was clear that S3E03, S3E04, S3E05 and S3E08 are the best episodes of the season with S3E04 ("And Now His Watch Is Ended") being the very best episode of Season 3 so far(although I would probably rate S3E03 "Walk of Punishment" ahead of S3E05 "Kissed by Fire"). I also really liked S3E06 ("The Climb") mainly for one of the best scenes of the series (for me), the dialogue between Lords Varys and Baelish discussing "the realm" at the end. ( I most certainly have rated it higher than the first two episodes.) But there's no question S3E06 ("The Bear and the Miaiden Fair") is simply disappointingly bad.I'm hoping very much that S3E09 is a 10-worthy episode!!

748	JMJ	2013-05-28	Thanks to you guys who did all the stats on this.
Off the cuff, the interesting observation to me is that the higher rated episodes overall seem to be those with more action scenes - fights, dragons, etc. One thing that I've occasionally forgotten watching the show is how the story is as much about the political intrigue as it is about fight scenes and CGI. The flashy stuff always pleases, though.
749	TheWhiteRabbit	2013-05-28	I'm the one who made the bold prediction that season 4 will be better than season 3, and maybe even the best yet. I reviewed the chapter summaries of ASOS after the Red Wedding and here's just a guess of how awesome season 4 could be:
EPISODE 1: Tormund and Co. ambush Castle Black; Tyrion greets the Red Viper (who I would love to see played by Antonio Banderas)
EPISODE 2: Danny arrives in Mereen, Dario defeats Mereen's hero in single combat; Bran &amp; Co. are north of the Wall with Coldhands
EPISODE 3: ****THE PURPLE WEDDING**** ; Danny learns of Jorah's betrayal
EPISODE 4: Sansa escapes King's Landing
EPISODE 5: Danny's rogue force takes Mereen; Jamie returns to KL
EPISODE 6: Sansa meets aunt Lysa; King's Landing Politics; Arya and Hound travel--Basically a bridge episode
EPISODE 7: Tyrion's trial; Danny banishes Jorah
EPISODE 8: Red Viper vs. The Mountain
EPISODE 9: Battle at the Wall; Arya and the Hound have a confrontation in an inn 
EPISODE 10: Littlefinger is revealed; Lady Lysa takes a tumble; Arya leaves the hound for dead; Stannis saves the Nights Watch; Jamie frees Tryion, Tyrion has a disagreement with his father 
That just covers the major events that will happen after the Red Wedding. How could anyone NOT think S4 will be better than S3? It could possibly be better than S1, at least for Stark Loyalist. And there's just SO MUCH AWESOMENESS that happens at the end that it will literally take two episodes, both finales, to end it.

It is only a small thing.
In SoS Quaithe appears , I think, only once, I could never judge if it was important or not.
With 2 episodes to go it looks , as if, she won't be in the season at all.
Alas Laura Pradelska has had only two scenes on the show so far.
She caught my eye season 2, I don't know why.
Alas, we either see her once the last two episodes or not at all, or she went on the cutting room floor.
Have not heard of her being on set for season 3.
759	Scarlet Seastar	2013-05-30	I kinda wish season 3 to end with the purple wedding. I know it doesn't happen immediately after the red wedding, but most viewers of the show that haven't read the books are going to be very pissed that the Stark king is killed, and killing Joffrey at the end would please them[I believe].And anyway, Tallissa is pregnant. I know that the show is not completely cannon, but can we take that fact as a hint that Jeyne Westerling is?

762	boojam	2013-06-01	Just an odd note.
In the Sansa-Tyrion wedding there were a lot of characters in the back , even major ones, who did not have speaking roles....
Poor Julian Glover has been a ghostly image floating in the background.
But , it seems Eugene Simons didn't have a contract for this year?
Lancel Lannister just vanished from being on screen.

From what I read, the actor really enjoyed being a part of GoT so I expect him to return if they want him to. I hope he does because I thought he started doing a swell job with Lancel last season.

I loved that they showed some things I assumed they'd just leave out, like the leeches, Sam the Slayer, and almost a 100% correct wedding. They changed Sansa not kneeling, but let<U+0080><U+0099>s be honest, how could they have shown the inner monolog to explain this properly? I didn<U+0080><U+0099>t mind the King J taking the stool instead. Dany<U+0080><U+0099>s scenes were amazing. She looked great in her Jedi headdress btw. The Second Sons were terrific. And the ending was amazing. It did seem a little rushed, but how cool were the ravens flying out in a swarm to end the show?

It was a good episode to introduce us to the last two episodes of this season.As usual, Daenerys' scenes are of the best of the series.I really didn't like any of the scenes of the wedding, only the conversation between Cersei and Margaery until the last part that she would kill her. But to prepare the non book viewers of what the Rains of Castamere is was a good touch.
779	Sxxman	2013-05-19	Definitely the best one in a while, I don't think there was anything in this episode that I hated, just a few nitpicks, 9/10.
780	Javi Marcos	2013-05-19	Even without Coldhands I loved the dynamics in King's Landing, Dragonstone and Sam-Gilly.
An 8 because nothing amazing happened (and I was really expecting Coldhands)
At least we got leeches.
781	Zman1863	2013-05-19	Back on form from the last two, I think. Loved that Sam's big moment finally made it in.
782	alexislalas	2013-05-19	Also, the leech scene. Pretty good way of adapting it.
783	summer_stark	2013-05-19	Great episode. Much tighter and more focused than that past few. The end was fucking awesome. Though I did wonder why Sam didn't take the dragon glass with him. But I can forgive that (and the fact that no one but gilly saw sam the slayer). Very glad they ditched Theon Robb and bran this episode. Made for a much better episode.
Eta: oh right. Gave it a 9.

784	Darth Pipes	2013-05-19	I'll give it a 9.  While not reaching the levels of Episode 4 and 5, this was better than the last two shows.  The fewer storylines helped the focus I think.  I have to say, I like TV Daario about a 1000 times better than Book Daahrio.

785	Blue eyes Crowlack	2013-05-19	Wonderful! Just a very fine price if work. I wish we could have got a bit more of the titans bastard, that guy was an arse.
786	PoorLollys	2013-05-19	that was awesome on so many levels. a nine.
787	Tewks44	2013-05-19	Very solid episode.  Among my top rated of this season.  I gave it a 9.
788	Grail King	2013-05-19	pissed they made Sansa kneel!
789	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-05-19	Gave it a 9. Pretty much everything worked for me. The final scene was really great with all the ravens. The sounds alone were great.
790	Trebla	2013-05-19	Very good episode. Solid 8. Really liked the Dragonstone scenes  as well as Dany's and the wedding.
791	Hound Dog	2013-05-19	Fantastic!
792	Ran	2013-05-19	Very solid episode, though the efforts to make Tyrion nice makes the character less interesting on the screen, and the absolutely pointless Melisandre nudity shows that they're shamelessly fulfilling their quota. But on the other hand, despite hating the sword-and-sorcery B-movie costuming for the Second Sons (the camp follower, OTOH, looks like she ran away from a John Norman novel), I thought Ed Skrein had just the right swagger for Daario. Maybe a little too much obvious posturing, but his line about always having a choice was... well, quite choice.
Also, end scene was terrific. Nice direction from MacLaren there. Makes up for the underwhelming bear pit sequence.
793	tito5601	2013-05-19	its an 8 for me i wouldve liked at least one scene with robb, we need some bannermen fast
794	FirelordSylar22	2013-05-19	Loved the episode.
Couple of questions
Is Mero that much of a dick in the books?
I saw a lot of people questioning the Daario casting, so how did it hold up to the book character. I personally enjoyed is suave swashbuckling performance.
795	Ran	2013-05-19	I would have liked Daario to be more of a popinjay,  a threadbare fop, and so on. But he did pretty well, I thought. And yes, Mero has a dark reputation in the novels, and acts very rudely.
796	franko99	2013-05-19	A solid 9, almost perfect.
I like the fact that Sansa did kneel, there was no way they show that and people not blaming Sansa (I loved that in the books, but it won't work in TV, specially with all the whitewashing of Tyrion). Drunk Tyrion FTW.
My only complain is a VERY nerd one, the Reyne's didn't rebel against Tywin, it was against Tytos, and Cersei wasn't born or was too young to remember it (and I don't think they were the "second most wealthiest house on the 7K")
797	Blaer Dayle	2013-05-19	9.5/10, so I ranked it a 9. I liked pretty much the whole episode, especially QoT commenting on the future of the family tree and Tyrion's drunken tirades, "I am the God of Tits and Wine! I shall build a shrine to myself" is my new favourite Tyrion line. Joffrey was awful, even as a religious reader of the series this show makes me hate him in all new ways. The walker's death was great, especially after seeing Ross Mullen (who plays the Walker) at Comic Con last week and getting an early tease about it. I only take off a .5 becaue Sansa kneeled, but it didn't ruin the scene by any means since they held it long enough to get the point either way.
798	Garlan Marius	2013-05-19	Great episode other than a certain change to the wedding ceremony.
799	Mark Antony	2013-05-19	its an 8 for me i wouldve liked at least one scene with robb, we need some bannermen fastAgree with this. Not having one Robb/Cat scene this episode kinda pissed me off. Hound and Arya + Stannis and Davos were great. Enjoyed Cersei and Dany. 8
800	BendTheKnee610	2013-05-19	Excellent episode; I gave it a 9.
The Sam the Slayer scene was legitimately suspenseful, and the wedding was pretty much perfect. 
It's about time they explained the meaning behind the Rains of Castamere.
801	Darth Pipes	2013-05-19	I was glad they had Dany's "I'm only a young girl" line.
802	7V3N	2013-05-19	I honestly thought this was the best episode. No awkward transitions, great pace, and all very true to the novels (which is not a necessity, but when the interpretation matches the content, it's always a plus). Really just the best episode of the series to date. I was so impressed.
I was cautious when the Gendry-Mel scene started getting, er, sexy (?) but they wrapped it up nicely. Get a man excited and his heart pumps blood faster. Plus HBO was able to fit in the boob quota.
People may complain about how Cersei threatened Marg, but I think it was the perfect display of Cersei's paranoia, jealousy, and violence. In her eyes, this is her world and if somebody dares to threaten the things she loves and enjoys, they will die regretting it.
I enjoyed Daario, who I cannot stand in the books. He is much more charming. The book Daario always came across as an asshole, the bad boy that girls like. This Daario comes across as a bad boy, but also a charmer and romantic.
No complaints from me, which is rare since I am highly critical. I think not having any Jon and Bran definitely helped, as they have been the weak stories this season.

803	dtones520	2013-05-19	Also, the leech scene. Pretty good way of adapting it.Naked Carise Van Houten doesn't hurt either.
804	WinterWarrior	2013-05-19	Great episode,  I gave it a 9. I thought it all hung together well and was very excited at the end when Sam the Slayer did his thing. I thought it was going to be the Cold Hands event but maybe that will come later.
Daario is FANTASTIC. What a hottie! I really think the Dany arc this season has been the best. Every Dany scene in every episode has been great.
Creepy what Mel did to Gendry. I guess she gets the leeches and the shadowbaby in a matter of minutes. At least our beloved Davos is out of the slammer. I liked the reference to the "battle in the snow".....
and thank goodness there were no Theon torture scenes!
Really fabulous.

And yes, Mero has a dark reputation in the novels, and acts very rudely.In my head I picture him as a Johnny Depp- Jack Sparrow type. Wish they had gone with some blue hair dye at least, but I think he did quite well. Watching with a show only person, the bag of heads was pretty fantastic!
807	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-05-19	I really fucking hate book Daario, but show Daario is actually ok. He doesn't look completely ridiculous and the stuff he says seems almost reasonable as opposed to completely over the top.
808	Ferrum Aeternum	2013-05-19	Fantastic episode, miles ahead of the last two weeks.  10/10.
809	Lady Gwynhyfvar	2013-05-19	Gave it a 9
Sam the Slayer, Daario, the leeches and Davos is free to hustle Gendry away. Love Sandor- Arya scene! Didn't even mind Sansa kneeling, since it clearly had to be done to keep the show storyline consistent. 
And Tyrion threatening Joff the Ass gets a big hurrah.
Eta- Second the thank god a break from Theon.

810	Florina Laufeyson	2013-05-19	8 heads of The Ned out of 10. Two reasons it got knocked, to an otherwise solid 9. Sansa kneeling. That....i just dont like that at all. At all. *sigh*Mel and Gendry. Wasnt kosher with how that went down. Otherwise, it was a great episode. Daario being likable is surprise and kinda nice. Hes still smarmy enough but much less in your face. Ill be interested to see what they do with him. Sam the Slayer. Fuck. Yes.
811	Ser Bronn's Mullet	2013-05-19	Fantastic. Loved pretty much everything. Tyrion/Sansa stuff was HOF worthy.
812	Lothar	2013-05-19	I give it an 8.  I didn't like that the Hound, Tyrion, and Sansa are all so much nicer than their book versions.  Sansa not kneeling is understandable given what a great perfect guy Tyrion is.  I miss the animosity in their wedding, how they both seemed to briefly hate each other.  It's one of those things that made it interesting and made you wonder "Will he consummate his marriage?"  In the show, I feel there was no chance.  I didn't like that there was no Robb and Catelyn.  I didn't like that Arya and the Hound was so short - I think Arya continues to get the shaft by the show.  Milsandre and Gendry went on way too long when we could have had more Arya/Hound or Robb/Catelyn.
I am always stunned by the reactions of the internet as I thought this episode was not nearly as good as the last two episodes (which I had zero complaints with) but it was better than episode 5, which I think I rated a 7.

814	boojam	2013-05-19	A very good episode.
Not much action , we will have to see the unsullied grade.
Amazing cutting the book into two seasons and and still so much to go!
Dany's story has been handled the best.
I just hope Arya's travels with the Hound carry over into next season, because I loved that story.
No Meereen till season 4 , that should work.

817	Pure Guava	2013-05-19	I enjoyed this episode. Gave it a 9.  But the ending I was anticipating seeing ColdhandsI was hoping the opposite! I'm hoping we see him at the end of the season. Last scene. Coldhands and the Black Gate. My ultimate season 3 wish.

821	Sun	2013-05-19	I gave it a 7, rounded up from 6.5. The ep couldn't retain my attention. It felt quite flat and somewhat disjointed in parts, in all but one scene failing to deliver its punches. In short it left very little impression on me and my group of unsullied, with the exception of the Sam the slayer. That scene was well done, despite the blatant directorial echoing of Hitchcock's The Birds, or perhaps because of it.

824	go joff go	2013-05-19	9.5 I actually like Sam the Slayer scene better than Dracarys.   I think one of the most beautifully shot scenes in the whole series.  The crows cawing in the background while he was talking to Gilly was awesome.
825	The Scabbard Of the Morning	2013-05-19	I think this was a great episode, the scenes and storylined actually had time to breathe, and the tension in the Sam the Slayer scene was great.  Probably the best horror moment in the entire show.
826	Ser Farbod	2013-05-19	I gave it a 9.

I LOOOOOOOOVED Tyrion's drunken humor.  Fantastic.

829	Lothar	2013-05-19	When you and others say Tyrion is too nice compared to the book (I guess you mean) , just what exactly do you mean by that?In the show, he actually got her to smile before the wedding.  It went much further the night of the wedding before he told her he couldn't do it.  He actually told her he wanted her.  He told her to get into bed.  He told her not to cover herself with the blanket.  Only then when she was laying there with her eyes closed did he say "Stop, open your eyes, I can't do this."It's just not half as interesting as the way the book did it.  Unlike the last two episodes which perfectly captured the Jaime/Brienne dynamic and did everything great.

My point is, a friend had a cow that lost all of its reproduction organs in birth and they had to shoot it. Point being several people said the meat would be no good because of the cow's adrenaline pumping and somehow making the meat bad. FYI: the meat was just as tasty as the rest I've had, nasty and pointless story I know but I could see a relation so sorry.......

Lots of son talk in the sam scene
834	QueenBeyondtheWeb	2013-05-19	Oops! New here. But ITA with expecting Sam's scene to have Coldhands, but I liked how it played out to give us Slayer Sam and I'm sure we'll see Coldhands soon.
835	mafalda	2013-05-19	9. Minus one point for the drawn out unnecessary sex scene between Mel and Gendry. I'm not a snob, and I like a good sex scene as much as the next person, but if it is warranted! She could have leeched him without riding him, unless she plans on making another assassin baby (which I doubt because who would she kill with it?)
Daario. Can't get him out of my head. The asshole sellsword wasn't bad looking either, minus the fact that he is an asshole.
836	DolorousKim	2013-05-19	A solid episode with an extremely gripping ending, I gave it an 8.What worked for me:A miserable drunken Tyrion raising his glass to a miserable Loras -- this scene and just about everything concerning the wedding feast (particularly the new family tree dynamics explained for you by QoT) gave me a guffaw.  So much misery for such a short ceremony, I loved it.Davos/Stannis - Finally, we check back in with the guys on Dragonstone.  Powerful scene between Liam Cunningham and Stephen Dillane in which Davos finally gets his freedom.  I wished we had gotten to see a bit more of this duo over the course of the season -- ahh well, perhaps in the final episodes, or next year...Daario doesn't suck!! - I was dreading the introduction of this character--needlessly, it turns out.  Show Daario looks to be a vast, vast improvement over book Daario.  Now this guy I could picture Dany falling for.Arya/Hound - The short sequence between them points towards some great character interactions to come.  There seems to be some good chemistry between Maisie Williams and Rory McCann.Sam the Slayer - Glad Sam got his mojo working.  Excellent final scene, it was creepy, spellbinding, and just all-around fantastic.What didn't work for me:Melisandre/Gendry/Stannis - The leech part was cleverly executed, but the naked Mel and Gendry bondage part didn't quite hit the mark for me.  Also, I wished that they didn't picture Stannis as being equally enthusiastic in naming the three "usurpers".  I liked the bit in the book where he hesitated before naming Robb.Cersei/Margaery - I thought that the naked threat on Cersei's part to have Margaery strangled in her sleep a bit too much to swallow.  They should have stopped the scene after she related the story of the Castameres, as that was already blatant enough of a warning.No Robb and Cat - Considering where we are in the season, I think that we really should have had a least one scene featuring Robb and Cat this episode.  At least one nice mother/son moment, perhaps?Oh, and one last very minor quibble, but something that mildly annoyed me nonetheless, when I see Conleth Hill and Jerome Flynn's names in the credits, I anticipate seeing them in at least one actual scene with at least a line of dialogue, not just a fleeting glimpse of them in the crowd at the wedding.

Almost perfect, and certainly one of the most entertaining episodes thanks to Tyrion the Drunk. Also, I couldn't help but applaud to the Sam the Slayer scene. The way the Other broke the steel sword and then himself got shattered by the dagger was amazing. Wish we had Coldhands in there, though. He might still show up otherwise how will Sam find the hidden door in the Wall.
849	cybobbie	2013-05-19	Great episode IMO, minor things bothered me, but I'm fine now with the adaptation of the books, so despite the fact that while watching it I get the impulse to say, why they made Sansa kneel, after the episode ends I get why they did. I just wanted more time in some scenes, like the party after the wedding, it was too short :/ Really liked Tyrion raising his glass to Loras. Loved the crows in the end and I was waiting to Coldhands... well I hope they bring him before the end of the season. Also, I agree with many comments about Daario, I mean I like him much more than book Daario.
850	Michael Stark Thenextwolf	2013-05-19	8. A LOT better than the last two. It was a good episode to introduce us to the last two episodes of this season.As usual, Daenerys' scenes are of the best of the series.I really didn't like any of the scenes of the wedding, only the conversation between Cersei and Margaery until the last part that she would kill her. But to prepare the non book viewers of what the Rains of Castamere is was a good touch.Dany parts are the best of the series.... no
851	wolverine	2013-05-19	Much better than last week.
852	jarl the climber	2013-05-19	Lets see. I did not care for the Cersei/Marge scene. I think they should have pushed this scene to episode 10 and it might have worked a little better. We can not see why Dany would sleep with Dario in the books, not going to be an issue in the show. Barristan and Mormont should be sacked for letting him sneak into camp and getting that close to the Khalessi. They should have had the dragons eat the heads. I thought it would only be the hardcore Sansanistas who would have a problem with the kneel. I thought it was appropiate that she did kneel in terms of what has happened in the show. Tyrion came to her beforehand has been respectful of her and promised not to abuse her. Why should she humiliate him for the amusement of Joffrey who deliberately took his step up? I gave it a 7, which is good score from me.
853	Arrow	2013-05-19	Live-blogging:We open with Arya and the Hound, who apparently in the meantime have become BFF's. Oh, maybe not. He caught her <U+0080><U+0093> good, it would have been ugly to see her smash his noggin with that rock. I hate to admit it but he's pretty sharp for a bona fide monster. Now that she knows her mama and bro are going to be at the Twins, she had a small improvement in her usual dour expression. Careful girl. BAMF's don't allow themselves tiny smiles of anticipation.Ah, the Mother of Dragons is back. What's that sand-colored portable tent she's wearing? Is that for protection in case of a sand storm? Dany, Dany, you were so fashion-forward last week. That drab getup just isn't you. And Barristan looks like he's wearing a pup tent he borrowed from a Boy Scout jamboree. Not to be critical, but the costuming department needs a shake-up. Hmm, it seems the lovely MOD is set on doing some more conquering.Three men to see Dany, or should I say two men and a human billy goat named Mero, and I think that's an insult to billy goats. That guy's just rank <U+0080><U+0093> he's also socially unacceptable, crude beyond disgusting, and a potty-mouth. Grey Worm, Jorah, and Barristan are all champing at the bit for the honor of putting him down like a dog. She stays calm. Good for you, Queenie. Boy, that Mero sure thinks highly of himself. Daario's cute, I must say, and quite the flirt.Aha, we knew it! Melissandre had bad intent toward Gendry. Who can trust a psycho bitch who burns men alive for not agreeing with her religious beliefs?Oh, Davos, the sight of you reading is so touching. You're such a good man, a really decent man. You might be becoming one of my favorite characters. Thank you for knowing Stannis so well, and for trying to talk him out of letting that puta loca with the cheapo-snaky hair extensions kill Gendry. Sigh, this show can really play on my emotions.Back to the bad boys, the Second Sons. Yeah, the one guy Mero is a P-I-G, pig. Oink. Coins from different lands, that's an interesting twist. Ladies and gents, it looks like we have ourselves an assassin.Sansa, you poor thing. What a painfully awkward clusterfuck of a wedding day.So Cersei did get around to making a blood-curdling threat against Margaery. And it really looked like that verbal dart hit the target, didn't it? Is it my imagination or did Margaery momentarily go pale? I sure would have. Kudos to the writers/director for the explanation of <U+0080><U+009C>Rains of Castamere<U+0080><U+009D> - I'd seen that title around the forums and wondered about it.Poor Sansa again. Could they invent more tortures for her to endure? Grrrr... and taking the step-stool away <U+0080><U+0093> what are we, still in middle school? Gah, I hate Joffrey. Sansa's hanging onto her dignity, gotta hand it to her.Poor Gendry, the sincere and innocent young bastard, overwhelmed by all the trappings of wealth <U+0080><U+0093> oh no, the wine trick again. Maybe not. Carice van Houten, the actress who plays Mel, has that strange quality - she looks like she's 30 years old in some light, sometimes like she's 45.Back to Gendry, oh shit tie me up, tie me down, now he's being used as leech food. How degrading. Wait, it's Davos and Stannis, come to see the fruits of her whoring, I mean labors, I mean lechery leechery. And now, oh goody. More black magic. We three kings... or rather we three usurpers... something tells me they're all toast. So now is she done with Gendry? I hope?Back to Sansa's worst nightmare. Loved Olenna's attempt to figure out the family ties <U+0080><U+0093> she almost went into a chorus of that old southern ditty <U+0080><U+009C>I'm My Own Grandpa<U+0080><U+009D>. And of course Cersei would subject Loras to a cold, invalidating remark. Cuz that's just how that bitchwad rolls.Sansa still can't shake that human colostomy bag, Joffrey. He still thinks he has the right to be a complete shit to her. Loved Tyrion's threat to castrate his wonderful nephew. Knew Tywin would get the situation under control again. Thank God he stepped in and stopped Joffrey's perverted version of the bedding ceremony. She's only 14, geez people, have mercy.So THAT's what Daario had in mind. Surprise! Two heads are better than one, as they say. I can almost hear strains of Olivia Neutron Bomb singing <U+0080><U+009C>Hopelessly Devoted to You<U+0080><U+009D> when he kneels and swears fealty to Dany with his <U+0080><U+0093> wow, lookit that curved thing <U+0080><U+0093> is that a sword or a scythe for harvesting grain? Maybe it's multipurpose. Anyway, he's apparently thrown in his lot with her. It's been a while since Dany got to do the horizontal bop with a hot guy. They're both so pretty! Just a thought - put them in swimsuits on a beach in southern California and they'd look like a surfer dude and his beach bunny.Okay, Shea showed her good side by grabbing the non-bloody sheets and spiriting them away so nobody would know that Sansa is still a virgin, or a maid as they say in Westeros. Good thinking, and good for the writers <U+0080><U+0093> hooray, they gave Shea all of four words to say. Less is more, right?Back to Sam and Gilly making their way to Castle Black <U+0080><U+0093> what a sweet scene about naming the baby, boy I hear ya about not choosing either dad's name. Talk about saddling a poor tyke with bad karma. That was downright spooky when the crows started screaming <U+0080><U+0093> wonderful protection for the fleeing couple. The Wight is one nightmarish skell. Wow, Sam! Dude, you came through! Your doppelganger/cousin in fiction, Samwise Gamgee, would be so proud of you. Sam the Slayer, indeed. Oh Gods, don't forget the knife! They forgot the knife.The final scene with the crows flying toward the camera is absolutely epic.This episode rates a solid 10, it absolutely flew by and was wonderful in so many ways.

854	Winterz	2013-05-19	I gave it an 8.They did very well with this episode covering a lot less plots while in the previous episodes it was quite the mix up of a dozen different plots and they also had to force scenes. This episode however, they kept it to only 4-5 plotlines and had enough time to allow scenes to properly develop without being rushed or anything. I do have to say though, I'd have enjoyed more action in the fight against Puddles Shards.I waited for it the entire episode and yet when it happens it's just...Sam attacks Shards, he evades and pushes him away, then Sam comes back and kills Shards. End of story. That scene needed to be more genuine. I'd have liked to see more horror in their faces.

855	Lucifer Lightbringer	2013-05-19	I gave it a 9.
This episode was wonderfully paced. Even where it deviated from the books, there was a sense of purpose and nuance that allowed this episode a greater depth and complexity than some others. It had time to breathe and to really elaborate on characterization. The focus and direction here was just great - truly it stands amongst the most well-crafted episodes on television.
I have to take off .10 of a point because they made the asshole Second Sons captain look exactly like me (only with 20 pounds more muscle). When I saw the previews I was really hoping he would be Daario so that I could have a lookalike on the show, but alas he was a foolish douche that only lasted one episode. I do like the guy the actually cast for Daario, though.
I enjoyed the Dany scenes and they stayed fairly close to the books.
The entire wedding ordeal was beautifully handled, even if it didn't have quite the same tension as there was in the book. All the little details made a great sum; Tyrion raising his glass to Loras, Tywin demanding a grandson, Cersei explaining the Reynes of Castamere, Joffrey being a creepy bastard, Sansa's quiet desperation and Tyrion's drunken frustration all made these scenes very compelling and well paced. Slow enough to get a feel for the situation, but with enough little 'events' to really populate the scenes with life.
I have a really big crush on Melisandre, so I always like to see her. I don't know that it was necessary to have the sex thrown in, but I suppose it shows how much passion she has for her beliefs and how much she is willing to manipulate others to achieve her goals. She sees everyone she slights or even harms as blessed for serving a role in her God's plan, and she praises strength and vitality for the use that she kind find for it. Certainly a little twisted, but I find it oddly attractive.
Finally, the Sam the Slayer scene was excellent. There was a palpable sense of horror and tension as the ravens descended on the abandoned house, and Sam finally got his moment to shine. I really disagree with the visual look of the Others; they were supposed to be like elegant ice-elves with Predator cloaking. Other than that, I feel like this scene was a perfect end to a great episode and it left the audience excited and disturbed.
Overall, really great stuff. Great GoT episode, great adaptation, and great television.

856	Rocketshoes	2013-05-19	Absolute crap.
Unnecessary gratuitous sex scenes from Melisandre given with the most flimsy justification(I need to trick him into having sex with me, to tie him up for sum reesin hur dur).
Tyrion has become vanilla ice cream, whitewashed into oblivion.
Sam vs The Other scene was a total disappointment.
Eliminating Coldhands from the show, another tick in the slow and steadily gaining list of reasons why this show is becoming increasingly less complicated and easy to digest.
Terrible. 4/10
This episode was so bad, it's almost put me off wanting to watch the show altogether.

857	Caryn Stark	2013-05-19	I gave it a 9. I am very happy with this episode.
858	Queen Elsa	2013-05-19	Arya and the Hound. That's it? Hu-huh!Tonight's episode is waaay better than last week. Not 100% perfect but I totally enjoyed watching it. Some things I disagree: like Sansa kneeling, the Hound speaking nicely, and Daario being a hottie. Gendry and Mel just get a rolling eyes from me. That's not necessary, but Stannis burning the gummy bear leech spooks me a little bit. Did Stannis shadowbaby killed Balon? Crackpot! I like the Sam the Slayer scene even though it shown too late. Dany's scenes with the Second Sons is excellent (makes me want to cut that guy's annoying tongue). My concern: how in seven hells Daario gets to sneak in so easily inside Dany's tent? If it isn't him, both ladies are dead. Glad the show made those wanton sword hilts btw. Anyway, I'm glad GOT is back on being awesome. I hope the next episode will top this one. Give the Second Sons a 9/10.

859	a7neu	2013-05-19	I gave it a 4, maybe a bit cruel... the reception was AMAZING. Dinklage was AMAZING. Dany was pretty great as well. Davos was great. Sam was well done. (OK, I take the 4 back lol)I am once again reminded how badly they've done Sandor Clegane in the show... his tone and demeanor in this is just not right at all. And Arya's riding side-saddle across Stranger's neck? Poor horse. Couldn't they have come up with something more realistic than that?? Painful for me, because Sandor/Arya chapters are my favorite part of the books hands-down.Melisandre and Gendry and the leeches was silly. They're just leeches.
860	Maester Hodor	2013-05-19	Great episode! It really made up for last week's episode, which I thought was a rather poor one.
9/10

862	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-19	Gave it a 9.  Just to sy something different,  I actually think Sam and Gilly have fantastic chemistry - the actors both deserve a ton of credit for playing their differing social status so well, and portraying a convincingly awkward/unsure relationship.  Love their scenes.
863	The Knight of Flours	2013-05-20	Solid 8/10.
Kind of thought Joff stealing the step-ladder was a bit cheesy and let out on 'aaaargh' as the Sam scene ended, with nobody bothering to pick up the silver bullet...I mean obsidian dagger..
864	Words of Winter	2013-05-20	I am writing this before reading any comments.I gave it a solid 8.  A good solid hour of TV.  Some low points, some high points, some other points ..., but overall a good solid hour of entertainment.ProsSam the SlayerHound/Arya,WeddingRaynes of Castamere detail (although slightly altered from the books)I even enjoyed TVyrion (TVyrion is the whitewashed TV Tyrion.  I now consider him too different to be Tyrion.)Genealogy Web, not tree.(I'm sorry, but I'm a guy, liked the Dany and Mel scenes.) (Liked the rational for the Mel swooning Gendry to get unsullied ripe blood.  I even like Dany teasing allegiance with her own nakedness)Baby naming - Craster - Sam's Face.  Randall - Sam's response.  In my head I heard him thinking, 'Gee, Gilly, some names are best not taken, like Craster, Randall, Adolf, Pol Pot, Lucifer.'ConsThe Mel nakedness was a little too long.Daario feels kind of smarmy, but I guess that is how I should feel about him.Joffrey was a little overdone (especially his breathing at the knife scene)The Gendry sacrifice seemed anticlimactical or out of position regarding because leeches, not that big of deal.  Did not mention they were going to burn him.Sansa -They should have upped the age or changed the reasoning.  She looks way too old for 14, but I could be wrong.MehChanges Riverrun to Twins - shortening the round about Hound Area journey.Changing up the details of the Raynes of Castamere. (I know the song is Rains of Castamere.  Raynes is the family)At first I was meh about he baby name because it is bad luck to name a child till its 2nd name day, but it became kind of funny.  (See above)Double Pro:Sam the Slayer - He has the best icebreaker around.  Puddles RIP(ieces)FWIW:Ep 1 8+ | Ep 2 - 6 | Ep 3 - 9 | Ep 4 - 9+| Ep 5 -7 | Ep 6 - 4 | Ep 7 - 7 | Ep 8 - 8 |
865	Arrogant Bastard	2013-05-20	I give it a very solid nine. Certainly the best episode since episode 3-5, and possibly even better than those two. Really liked the narrow focus of this episode; I believe if you don't count the opening scene with Arya and the closing one with Sam, the rest of the episode was split between Essos, Dragonstone, and King's Landing. What I likedStannis: Thought he was developed well this episode, and I liked his interactions with Davos. At first I thought he was being set up as a villain again, with his more certain view that Gendry needed to be sacrificed, until Davos revealed that if Stannis felt this way he wouldn't be freeing him. Slight nitpick in that Stannis says Robb's name first instead of last when throwing the leeches on the fire.Yunkai: All done well, and surprisingly I wasn't annoyed by Daario. Tyrion's Wedding: Different than the book, but I really liked how they spent a large amount of time on the wedding and the various interactions. It did not feel rushed at all. Sansa's kneeling makes sense to me from a creative standpoint; without her inner monologue, she would not come off well at all to the audience.Only thing that felt kind of rushed was Arya's scene with the Hound, which I felt would have worked better had they had a previous scene together other than the capture.
866	Mav Of The Canals	2013-05-20	9/10. I thought it was fantastic! Would have rated it a 10 if there were less Dany scenes, though. Heh,
867	Kienn	2013-05-20	7, a few good scenes but a couple of the important scenes were really disappointing.
868	gogorath	2013-05-20	10.  One of the best episodes ever. Almost perfect.
869	Nictarion	2013-05-20	8/10. Really good episode. The pace was great. The hour flew by. I loved Sam the Slayer. Cersei telling Marg off was great. Dany was really good , as she has been all season. Daario was a badass, I am in the minority of people that actually like him in the books. Tyrion was cracking me up being so drunk at the wedding. Really I have no major complaints.
870	Alboin	2013-05-20	my first 9 this season.Not even because of particular scenes (althought some were really great) but overall feeling was of a very dynamic and well-thought-out episode. Sometimes on the show it feels like they have an unachievable deadline for a script and have to rush to write, just not having enough time to really create a  powerfull and yet faithfull adaptation to the books. But not this time (gladly)+ of course final Sam scene, amazing piece of thriller.+ the wedding, with Sansa's frustration and Tyrion's escapism, his threat to Joff and that awkward moment between Cersei and Loras... Loved it. No problems with the Sansa's kneeling for me, although I wished Joff's threat to bed Sansa would be played in the end somehow.+ Daario and Dany sequence was just almost as imagined it from the books.+ Liam  Cunningham is just brilliant... Maybe my favorite actor on the show- Only big complaint I have is Varys being an extra in this episode and overall underusage him this season.

871	amilas	2013-05-20	I voted this episode as an 8. I kind of wish I had voted 7 but it's too late.
If I were to summarize this episode in a word it would be "beautiful". The scenes and the acting were well done and it flowed beautifully. That being said, the changes are getting a bit ridiculous. I've always been one of the few who has accepted the changes because it still kept the heart of the story. Some of these changes (primarily the Gendry/Melisandre bit) were just so gratuitously Hollywood that it really irritated me for the last time. It's been a long time coming, but it finally got to me. I'm still rating it higher than it should be, but really only because I'm giving the directors the benefit of the doubt that they will reign it in a little bit. If not...then I'm just going to have to view this as a parallel world or something to enjoy it.
872	DaveRoid	2013-05-20	9, a very solid episode overall.
Loved the full atmosphere of Tyrion's wedding.

873	wizardface	2013-05-20	NICE cover of the wedding! 
Dario seems kinda bamfish
I liked the first scene with Arya/hound
every single week I love the scenery!
tbh i cant remember much about the gendry scene from the books-seems like a good lead up for later though!
Sam-Gilly scene was good. I liked the naming-the-baby banter. 
For some reason this show becomes like 10x more awesome for me whenever I see a weirwood tree and its red leaves. 
I wonder what non-book readers will think? 
9
874	ohpooratlas	2013-05-20	I voted an 8 but really felt it was an 8.5.
It was an all around solid episode and I don't think I had any major problems with it.  There was just nothing that stood out for me to give it a 9.  Probably because I felt Sansa's sadness/uncomfortableness of the marriage was downplayed (though Tyrion's wasn't).
875	Turin Turambar	2013-05-20	9 for me.
876	Watcher_inthe_Woods	2013-05-20	This was a 9 /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' /> So much better than the last 2 weeks!
877	Master Forel's Fro	2013-05-20	10 I loved everything about this episode, Arya and the hound, margaery's *burn* she thinks she's talking to sansa, loved the wedding, I was worried they'll do a bedding but so glad they didn't 'change' that. Daario polishing his naked lady's. second fav after episode 4.
878	Maria Underfoot	2013-05-20	What we got was great, very solid acting, good writing, everything made sense.
BUT isn't anyone else sad about what we missed?? One episode before the RW, I think that they could have used it to show some more Robb and Cat.. As a last reminder of who they were, and why it is so shocking that they die.
879	TomBadgerlock	2013-05-20	I actually don't have a clue how to rate this one. I gave it a ten just because. No episode could be worse than last week's.
880	Tyrion_the_Oneironaut	2013-05-20	Drunk Tyrion gets a 10.
Daario gets a 10.
Titan's Bastard. 10.
The Dragonstone scenes, however, dragged this one down to a 7 for me.
881	rmholt	2013-05-20	I'm a little sad we might not get to see Barristan clock someone to death with a wooden staff, but other than that, fine
882	The hairy bear	2013-05-20	For me:
Yunkai receives a 9,5
Sam and the other a 9,5
Dragonstone a 7,5
King's Landing a 4
I hated how they made the character of Sansa a collaborator in the marriage. Smiling to Tyrion, kneeling, having her undress herself without even making Tyrion to ask...I didn't like it at all. Also, Cersei was completely out of line with Margaery.

883	kkae	2013-05-20	The worst episode of the entire show. Not really but that is how I feel at the moment. The season is at the point where I'm just fed up with it.
884	Mr Smith	2013-05-20	Ugh, very average episode. 7 at best.
The wedding was handled VERY poorly, but I thought the bedchamber scene between Tyrion and Sansa was good.
Daario was flat, and his dialogue was even flatter.
Stannis/Davos scene was pretty good, and the leeches were also done well.
Sam the Slayer was not at all how I pictured it, and felt quite clumsy.
Very forgettable episode.
But in other news..... Tits!
885	Mr Hodor	2013-05-20	gave it 9..close to perfect
886	Sir Mark of the East	2013-05-20	Gave it an 8. It was an okay episode, definitely better than the last.
887	FlightEcho	2013-05-20	So many differing views on here, ol. They either hate it or live it.
888	Holdfast	2013-05-20	An 8.  A lot better than the last two episodes.  Would have loved more Arya/Hound screen time, but also hoping this just means we'll see their storyline following through to Season 4.  Totally over the number of nude scenes this season.
889	jhodes	2013-05-20	The worst episode of the entire show. Not really but that is how I feel at the moment. The season is at the point where I'm just fed up with it.Exactly how I feel. Far from the worst episode for me, but still, not a good season so far.
890	jhodes	2013-05-20	So many differing views on here, ol. They either hate it or live it.Very true. As I read the comments, many seems to liked the wedding, others hate it.It's impossible to please them all.
891	brAnthelAstgreenseer	2013-05-20	I did not like the last scene.So Puddles was sent by Old Gods .Ravens are bad.What were they trying to tell?
892	StannisandDaeny	2013-05-20	7. It was good but I took some points away for what they did (or rather, are still doing) to Stannis.
893	Pinkie Baelish	2013-05-20	I gave it a 9. A solid improvement from the last 2 weeks.
894	David Selig	2013-05-20	Very good episode overall. 8/10. Daario is awesome.
But Saint Tyrion is really getting tiresome.

895	Juli Cachet	2013-05-20	Gave it a 9. Loved it except for Sansa's kneeling.
The last scene was rather weird. I almost expected Coldhands to show up, but I still liked it. Daario is awesome. Loved Joffers and Cersei at the wedding. And Davos learning to read was adorable.
896	Isy	2013-05-20	Much better episode than the previous two. Really, really enjoyed this one. I gave it 9/10 as I thought the plots meshed well and didn't feel overcrowded (each scene was given time to breathe), the scenes were generally straight from the books and the Marg/Cersei scene was a welcome addition and clever way to explain the Rains of Castamere.
Nitpicks of the week: Sansa bowing to have the cloak put on her shoulders (presumably so the show doesn't make her look like a bitch since they've white-washed Tyrion) and discussing names for Gilly's child when I thought they normally wait a year because of chance of baby dying and Cersei outright threatening Marg (too overt, where is the subtelty!)
I still think I would have preferred the Sansa wedding to have been sprung on her, and her to be more hard to the whole ceremony. She just seemed to willing to go along with it, because she has been given time to think it through and been encouraged by Margarey. I am not sure where they are going with the Cersei/Loras plot, other than dragging it out.
897	King Tyrion I	2013-05-20	Gave it a 9. Loved it except for Sansa's kneeling.The last scene was rather weird. I almost expected Coldhands to show up, but I still liked it. Daario is awesome.

898	Connor Snow	2013-05-20	Was about to rage about how HBO were portraying Stannis the Mannis as a dick all over again, but that Davos line and the viewer realisation that Stannis is going along with it because he's a man of duty and WON'T sacrifice Gendry renewed my hope for his story. Also the 'battle in the snow' line..
899	The Killer Snark	2013-05-20	I gave it 10. Loved the wedding, love the treatment for Daario Nahaaris. Only slight nit is the lack of hesititaion before Stannis throws the leech on the fire to seal the fate of Robb Stark. Brilliant white walker ending. Pitch perfect pace and acting, though I'd rather Sansa wasn't quite so blandly presented. But that's more to do with the fact that series watchers aren't privy to her point of view. And Tyrion and Joffrey are back in fine form. All in all, a few fractions of a millimetre from being absolutely flawless. How disappointing it would be if they bungled the real peak moments around the corner after this.
900	Wankerfell	2013-05-20	How is it that nobody mentioned the atrocious dub job they did with Daario's voice? I hope they clear that up in the future.
901	boojam	2013-05-20	[*]Sansa -They should have upped the age or changed the reasoning.  She looks way too old for 14, but I could be wrong.So far D&D have just left the ages out. It's going to get even more obvious if this show does go for four more years.Lord! Even Maisie Williams is starting to look like a teenager, and if they get to Ep. 7 she will be 19!In the book Tyrion had made the decision not to consummate regardless of her age, so just leave that part out.
902	Queen of Whores	2013-05-20	9/10. I would give it a ten, but I want to save that for the final two episodes.
This was personally my favorite episode since the season 1 finale. Despite a few small nitpicks, I loved everything about this episode. The wedding, the leeches, the Seconds Sons, and Sam the Slayer. All perfect. Plus Dany and Mel showing nearly all definitely didn't hurt. 
Narrowing down the amount of storylines this episode definitely made it superior to every other episode this season, in my opinion, and 3x9 looks like to continue this trend, which is good.
903	boojam	2013-05-20	In the show, he actually got her to smile before the wedding.  It went much further the night of the wedding before he told her he couldn't do it.  He actually told her he wanted her.  He told her to get into bed.  He told her not to cover herself with the blanket.  Only then when she was laying there with her eyes closed did he say "Stop, open your eyes, I can't do this."That's a distinction without a difference.If I have said once I think I have said it a dozen times.The actors playing the book roles are going to bring a different dimension and demeanor to their characters, nothing to be done about it.So far , for me, Charles Dance has brought a just flat dull Tywin (in the book) to life on the show, I think that true of other characters from the books. The actors are better characters than GRRM wrote, in my opinion.It's just not half as interesting as the way the book did it.  That is your take, not mine I disagree.

905	boojam	2013-05-20	How is it that nobody mentioned the atrocious dub job they did with Daario's voice? I hope they clear that up in the future.Hmm,did not notice that.Does that actor have a strong accent? , I have never seen him before.
906	boojam	2013-05-20	Gave it a 9. Loved it except for Sansa's kneeling.The last scene was rather weird. I almost expected Coldhands to show up, but I still liked it. Daario is awesome. Loved Joffers and Cersei at the wedding. And Davos learning to read was adorable.In the novel I don't remember Coldhands showing up till later.
907	Juli Cachet	2013-05-20	In the novel I don't remember Coldhands showing up till later.Sure, but I assumed so because of the many ravens in the tree. It would've been cool if the Bran / Sam encounter would've happened in the finale, so it would've made sense to introduce Coldhands for that.
908	The Fourth Head	2013-05-20	I'm surprised how positive this episode was received. They kept close to the books- fine, but considering the quality of the material, it was the least entertaining hour of TV I have watched yet. I gave it a 6.5, rounded up to 7. Never has an hour of GOT passed by so slowly.Reasons? Something as basic as louder music can really enhance the feel of a scene. There was so little of it. There were far too many long pauses, dead air, followed by flat lines. The quality of the source material guaranteed the wedding would be entertaining, but it fell a little flat emotionally. Where was the sharp contrast between the energy of the music, and the misery of the people? The music was barely audible and nothing like how I imagined it.I was expecting us to hear "rains of castamere" as well but no. A missed opportunity which could have major consequences for unsullied next episode. Without Cat spelling it out- "oh no, not the Rains of Castamere- that's the Lannister song!" the relevance will be totally missed until crossbow quarrels start to fly.I understand the value of longer scenes, but why does so much time need to be devoted to discussing the quality of Dany's Dothraki, unnecessary reminders about Davos' inability to read, or Sam explaining to Gilly what surnames are? Who cares?! It served no purpose in enhancing the overall scene. Why does a Yunkai sellsword company of two thousand men get more time and attention in one episode than Roose Bolton had received in 2 series? They aren't important. Dany would have won the fight without them anyway, and Daario's whole purpose is an irrelevant love distraction- no more. It just doesn't interest me.If episode 9 is to be a proper climax, why are we not getting any build up? Time spent fleshing out the second sons could have been spent reminding us that in westeros there is a war happening, which after 8 episodes this season, look totally forgotten. Why couldn't we see Robb and Roose' reunion prior to entering the twins, discussing the events of the ruby ford- an almighty significant forerunner- his lack of men, Robb could consult with some more northern bannermen about the events in order to flesh out a "Smalljon" or "Manderly" character who demonstrates goodwill towards Robb, or why not spend more time developing Arya and the Hound's relationship? With such a large cast of underserviced characters, I was annoyed that the Titan's Bastard got so much attention and I hope we don't get a squashed and rushed RW as a result. There is a lot of material to get through here.One thing I was delighted about- the final scene. I was relieved not to see Coldhands- yet. There is plenty of time for him to arrive. what is far more important to "The Song of Ice and Fire" is ensuring the inclusion of the Sam the Slayer scene which I was getting pretty anxious about- I was scared they would miss it out all together. The relevance of Dragonglass very important, as is Sam's journey from coward to someone with a degree of bravery and use. After 2.7 seasons playing the fool, it was high time people started caring about him and stopped seeing him as a boring, irritating idiot. It was high time the north received some tension, and we got it. hats off.

909	Mulled Wino	2013-05-20	10 for naked emilia.  Would have been an 8.5, my highest grade for the season.  No robb, jon and cat scenes does wonders for their ratings.
The only thing left I hate is the stannis arc/story and Tyrion.   But I hate book Tyrion anyway so I dont count that against the show.
910	Mulled Wino	2013-05-20	9/10. I would give it a ten, but I want to save that for the final two episodes.This was personally my favorite episode since the season 1 finale. Despite a few small nitpicks, I loved everything about this episode. The wedding, the leeches, the Seconds Sons, and Sam the Slayer. All perfect.

Narrowing down the amount of storylines this episode definitely made it superior to every other episode this season, in my opinion, and 3x9 looks like to continue this trend, which is good.Are you an HBO plant?  You're planning on giving a 10 in the last 2 episodes?  Such an odd sentence.
911	clarkside	2013-05-20	Most of what I like has already been said before in depth - Sam The Slayer, Leeches, Daario, no Cat, no Bran, return of Davos.
One thing I haven't seen mentioned is Shae kept her mouth shut! (thank the gods, old and new) most of the time she annoys the crap out of me but Sibel Kekilli sold those scenes with expressions and dirty looks. A job very well done!
I was hoping for cold hands but I'm happy to wait. This episode was 9/10 for me, I can't complain at that.
912	The Anti-Targ	2013-05-20	Very happy with that episode. At first I was a bit, no! with Sansa kneeling, but then I was, OK because of the whitewashing of Tyrion's character Sansa refusing to kneel would have just made the audience be all pissed off with Sansa.
And YAY! no Theon.
913	boojam	2013-05-20	I'm surprised how positive this episode was received. They kept close to the books- fine, but considering the quality of the material, it was the least entertaining hour of TV I have watched yet. I gave it a 6.5, rounded up to 7. Never has an hour of GOT passed by so slowly.Attention span problems?
914	Jorah the Explorer	2013-05-20	Like 41% of us, I gave the episode a 9.  Much improved from the previous two.  If you are nitpicking this one, I'd have to call you an eternal pessimist.  A very enjoyable episode start to finish.
915	waaimasjien	2013-05-20	This episode was extremely good. The suspense! After the leech-scene my boyfriend kept asking me during the Tyrion-Sansa wedding if something reaaally bad was going to happen.People are seriously nitpicking on Sansa kneeling? There's no way you'd get her not kneeling across on screen without making her look like a total cunt, which really wouldn't be right. On the ravens - I saw that as a warning from Bran (due to the emphasis on the face in the weirwood tree) and I loved the image. Very cinematic.Something as basic as louder music can really enhance the feel of a scene. There was so little of it.I was expecting us to hear "rains of castamere" as well but no. A missed opportunity which could have major consequences for unsullied next episode. Without Cat spelling it out- "oh no, not the Rains of Castamere- that's the Lannister song!" the relevance will be totally missed until crossbow quarrels start to fly.You should probably turn the volume up. The Castamere theme was played again during the Cersei/Marg conversation. It's been used a few other times this season, and Cersei spelled out some of the lyrics. I think the unsullied will be fine. Music in general was great in this episode. I just love the Dragonstone theme.
916	Accursed	2013-05-20	I honestly cant seem where all the love for this episode is coming from, this was easily one of the weakest of this season for sure.
Though I'm not really suprised, as alot of the choices they made did make sense given the constraints, it was still dissapointing.
It's sad that the arya/hound chapters are seemingly going to be essentially skipped, (though I suppose they can try to make up for this next season.)
The hound was far too nice. Quite a few characters were unconvincing this episode, I dont mind the fact that the plot has to be simplified for the show, but when characters have to act so out of character it just comes across of unconvincing.
Even moreso with no rob/cat this episode its clear that Its gonna take one hell of an episode 9 to at least somewhat make up for the damage the show has done to rob and cat's storylines. We'll overall this season has still been really well done, I hope the last two episodes make up for this dissapointment.
917	MisunderstoodFrey	2013-05-20	Good episode. I found Tyrion to be funny for the first time in far too long. Sad what they did to the Titan's Bastard /frown5.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':frown5:' /> And SO GLAD that someone FINALLY acknowledged that poor forgotten Balon is actually one of the damn kings!!!!
918	Conchobar	2013-05-20	A 9. I gave last weeks a 7. This episode was surprisingly satisying. I loved Sam the Slayer, and goosebumps when it broke his sword.
919	rmholt	2013-05-20	I personally get so much out of TV Sansa's facial expressions.  She is really good.  Tyrion and Loras also had a nice silent exchange at the wedding.
920	The Mighty Conch	2013-05-20	Better than last week's.
921	Inceptor	2013-05-20	i gave it 9 , seems fair,  it was good episode and made me watch it 2 times .... its rare for me to watch any series and their episodes 2-3 times....
922	Reposado	2013-05-20	solid i guess, not among the worst of the season, not among the best.
923	Dotini	2013-05-20	I gave it a ten,  because it was the best I've seen. I was particularly moved by the Stannis/Davos dungeon scene. The aesthetics of acting, scenery and music were top-notch in every scene.
924	Gendels Children	2013-05-20	very good, quite satisfying I gave it a 9/10 because it gave me chills and thrills hehe, fantastic ep.. will now watch again
925	Lord of Cheese	2013-05-20	It was ok i guess. I gave it an 8.
Finally get to see Sam the Slayer, but nobody there to see it happen!!!!!!! So i dont think he will get given the name in tv.
Too distracted by Danny and Mel and that random whore.
Daario is a clown. So wrong. All i can see is 'teeth'.
926	DaveSnow House Stark	2013-05-20	Gave it an 8 because there was quite a bit from the books included.
Sam the slayer finally
Daario, and prettied up for the screen
Leeches and acknowledging the three kings
Weirwood tree and ravens
Rains of Castamere explaination, would've been nice to hear it more so when it plays next week people would more easily recognize it
Arya finally looking happy when the Hound told her they were going to the Twins for the wedding, poor kid
927	Queen of Whores	2013-05-20	Are you an HBO plant?  You're planning on giving a 10 in the last 2 episodes?  Such an odd sentence.I can tell you I'm not working for HBO. I don't even live in America. I said that I was saving the 10 rating for the final two episodes because I'm positive they're going to be amazing, and surpass every other episode this season. If I handed out a 10 rating now, there would be no higher rating to give for the episodes with the real 'wow' moments. I also don't see what was so odd about my sentence. I thought it was pretty clear it meant I had high expectations for the final two episodes and want to hold off giving away a 10 rating so that if/when I assign it to one of the final two episodes it will hold more significance than if I handed out 10s all the time. If only I worked for HBO... I'd love to watch these episodes early. The two week wait is gonna be frustrating.
928	Kaitscralt	2013-05-20	I gave it a 10, would have given it an 11 if Melisandre rode on Gendry for 5 more minutes.
929	Robin Of House Hill	2013-05-20	OK, let's see if I can get this in without the board crashing, again.
9/10.
Tyrion stole the show.  Ser Davos and Sandor Clegane were excellent, as well.  Heck, even Cersei was good.
930	Gannicus	2013-05-20	Fantastic
I think they did this episode about as well as it could be done. It doesn't have a ton of action in the material but each scene was still enjoyable as well as meaningful.
931	TheEvilKing	2013-05-20	Gave it an 8 out of 10. Tyrion was great. His wedding was fun, Sansa was pretty good even. Sam stuff was pretty good. Daario... eh. Underwhelming. Dragonstone was pretty decent, although I could have done without the leech dick.
932	A Redeemed Hound	2013-05-20	Gave it a 6.  Very good episode.  Would be nice if any of these episodes were a full hour.  Would have like more Arya/Hound banter.  Would have liked a longer time spent with Sam and Gilly.  Still, everything was spot on.  The wedding was great.  Feel so bad for Tyrion and Sansa.  Enjoyed the Cersie/Margery conversation, as well as the Queen of Thorns.  It was all really good.  But I was really expecting some scenes with Robb as they make their way to the Twins.  I guess I am really worried they aren't going to do Episode 9 justice.  But there were plenty of lines regarding the Rains of Castemere last night so that was fun.  The porn scene was okay since it made some sense.  Although telling Stannis she needs to be subtle so as to not spoil the meat and then just tying Gendry down and pulling out leeches seemed kind of silly.  Not exactly subtle.  Dany continues to rock.  The Titans Bastard was great.  Daario is dreamy so the ladies will like him.  Loved the ravens at the end.  Coldhands must me near.  I can see that as a great season ender with him sitting atop his stag holding out his hands gor Sam and Gilly.
Okay.  I'm going to change my vote to a 7.  But I am massively pissed about the sub-hour episodes and now we have to wait two weeks for the next episode?!?!?!?!?!?  WTF HBO?
933	Gendels Children	2013-05-20	It was ok i guess. I gave it an 8.Finally get to see Sam the Slayer, but nobody there to see it happen!!!!!!! So i dont think he will get given the name in tv.Too distracted by Danny and Mel and that random whore.Daario is a clown. So wrong. All i can see is 'teeth'. yeah that's rather a big pitty... poor Sam

935	poggo	2013-05-20	A very good episode.
Especially after the last two episode, it seems, like finally something happened.
Yes, some scenes could have been made even better, but I would say, that I am really happy with this episode.
936	Ser Graymax	2013-05-20	Thought I was watching the paperback cover model Fabio, ehr, Daario.  How could Dany like someone prettier than she?   He might have worked better for Loras.  Didnt seem like too good an actor either.
Id trade a few leeches for sex with Mel anyday.  Wind up with a few at the Lake anyway and no sexy time reward.  High creep factor on the penis though but no pain except for maybe taking them off that way.
8.5 from me.
I like Sandor, this is the way he came across to me in the books under what he shows to the world.  I feel the same way about Tyrion.  He is softer in the show for the audiences to understand him.
Like show Stannis better also.
As for next week, I recorded the show and am going to watch it again then.

937	The Boar of Gore	2013-05-20	6/10
Disappointed again. It jumped around from scene to scene with no unity. The dialogue was flat, and there was some clumsy exposition. The second sons leaders can't act. And so much seemed unnecessary. Did Melisandre really have to pretend to sleep with Gendry in order to leech him? Stannis seemed to decide to release Davos on a mere whim. Why didn't the Hound tie Arya up when he went to sleep? Why have Dario sneak into the tent as an assassin when he was going over to her side at that point. Why show the 3 picking coins at all? What were the ravens there for? Why did the White Walker not kill Sam (again)? You can't engage emotionally when things don't make sense.
938	Winterfellian	2013-05-20	Wow! A surprised so many people liked it. I changed the channel more than once out of sheer boredom. Oh, and now I absolutely loath show Tyrion. They have stripped the character of basically everything that makes him interesting in the books. I think this will be the last seaon I'll be watching. I give the episode a 5.
					
					
							Edited by Winterfellian, 20 May 2013 - 09:10 AM.
939	Daenerys Must Die	2013-05-20	Thought this was a really well constructed episode - the scenes had a lot of room to breath and the writing was pretty good.
The Titan's Bastard looked like he would be better suited for Spartacus than GoT but he served his purpose - I found myself really liking Daario (not sure that's a good or bad thing since I didn't like him in the book) but on screen he comes off a bit more likable imo.. I actually pictured Daario in my head to be more like Mero (just not as vulgar I guess) which is why I hated him but as the 'play it cool pretty-boy' he's not so bad.
Seems like Coldhands could make a good final scene of the season to me - the ravens were a bit of foreshadowing for him which was cool and Sam slaying the Other was awesome .. loved how all you could see was the Obsidian dagger with the ice around it just as I imagined when reading it (but Sam didn't pick up the dagger before he left - I can't remember whether or not it's mentioned in the book whether or does or not)
Edit: Gave it an 8 (last week was 7, highest rated were 9's (4 & 5). I don't give 10's really)

940	Arkash	2013-05-20	Best episode of the season !
941	Ran	2013-05-20	429 votes in and the episode is rating an 8.40 of 10 so far. Puts it right in the middle of the pack, according to prior votes for the other episodes this season.
942	Daenerys Must Die	2013-05-20	I wonder how many non-reader were expecting something to happen to Joffrey last night - the immediate cut from the burning leeches to Joffrey sitting at the wedding reception immediately made me think of that - it also kind of eases the mind about Robb next week (warning signs that we don't heed) since nothing came of Joff/Tyrion's confrontation.
I thought that was a cool scene and HBO get to toss some sex in (don't mind - I'm a big Mel fan in that respect)
943	Talbot	2013-05-20	8/10
I understand why some people don't like it, but I can't really give this show less than a 6-7 because its just that much better than the rest of TV.
I would also suggest not rating it based on changes between the book and show, because that's stupid, pointless and honestly really petty.
Stannis/Davos had a great scene, I like Dillane's portrayal and how they're adapting Stannis to the screen.
Sansa kneeling is fine, for reasons mentioned earlier. The reception was hilarious in several different fashions.
Marg/Cersei is a fantastic dynamic. I like how Marg is clinging to her with the cheesiest smile on her face while Cersei is talking of executions and strangling her.
No issue with "Meldry". I like boobs, and it goes along with the sheep comparison.
Sam the Slayer was shot fantastically, digging the Randyll reference for later seasons.
Solid episode, not as good as the 3-5 stretch but it held its own with a good focus on key events.
944	Lord of Castamere	2013-05-20	Great episode 9/10. There was lots of interesting things going on in several sub plots.
945	Cheevs	2013-05-20	Great episode! I give it 9/10!Dany scenes were excelent. I found series Daario ten times more interesting than book Daario. It's the first episode of this season I thoroughly enjoyed, I'm very glad.Can't wait to see what coldhands is gonna look like!
946	Ser Drizztos	2013-05-20	8/10
Good episode but nothing that really wowed me. Although the scenes at KL were awesome as usual.
947	TheWhiteRabbit	2013-05-20	After my first watch I thought it was a solid 8. After my second watch I thought it was great. I gave it a 9.

948	Sand11751	2013-05-20	Any episode that starts off with Sandor or Arya is already an A+ for me. I looked forward to their scenes this year almost as much as Sandor's with Sansa. They've toned him down more, made him even palatable; I've gotten used to it and won't beat that dead horse here. But I love the little hints of some sort of honor just below the surface in TV Sandor, which you really have to scratch hard for to find with book Sandor. I'm constantly amazed at how the child actors and newbies hold their own with veterans. Cersei is still one of my favorite characters, even if she's being humanized. But she was on fire last night with, "If you ever call me sister again, I'll have you strangled in your sleep." Boom! Now that's the Cersei I know and love. I've honestly had it up to here with Margaery's two-faced bullshit - I had sympathy for the book version, none for the snake in the grass on TV. She and Cersei are cut from the same cloth. Daario still isn't interesting to me, but I could get used to looking at this one, almost as much as I enjoyed Jaqen - thanks for the eye candy, D&D. I still miss Moon Boy and Butterbumps. Has anyone seen Ser Dontos lately?
949	Usurper's Dog	2013-05-20	Oops! New here. But ITA with expecting Sam's scene to have Coldhands, but I liked how it played out to give us Slayer Sam and I'm sure we'll see Coldhands soon.
950	Nox Irradiata	2013-05-20	Any episode that starts off with Sandor or Arya is already an A+ for me. I looked forward to their scenes this year almost as much as Sandor's with Sansa.

Has anyone seen Ser Dontos lately?Totally agree!  I loved the Arya/Hound interaction and am looking forward to more scenes with them. I know a lot of posters felt Cersei's direct threat was too much, but personally I loved seeing the lioness show us her claws. Suck it, Margaery!
951	PatrickStormborn	2013-05-20	4/10What I liked:CerseiSam's sceneThe music when Daario swore fealty to DaenerysThe rest was awful. The writing was cringeworthy, they cut out some of the best lines, Tyrion is just embarassing to watch (not in the way the writers intended), and once again the female nudity felt forced and sexist.Also Daario is absolutely hideous.
952	SerArthurHeath	2013-05-20	8/10, pretty good
Though either the Gendry sacrifice + rescue won't happen until next season or I have to say I was wrong and the season ends on the PW. Damn
953	Kaethas	2013-05-20	I gave it 8. A small one. Much better than the two previous episodes. It was nice with fewer characters and it has a good and natural flow.
I don't like the new Gendry stuff and a horny Melisandre didn't change that. Again, the nudity is just unnecessary.
And with all the ravens at the end I expected to see Coldhands...
954	Loras	2013-05-20	I gave this episode a 9/10.
I loved the whole sequence on Dragonstone, barring that scene in Episode 3, the Dragonstone storyline has been consistently good for the entire season.  I particularly loved the scene between Stannis and Davos in the dungeon, everything about that scene was masterfully done.  I really like how they are playing Davos as the Jiminy Cricket to Stannis' Pinnochio.
Once again, another fantastic set of scenes featuring Daenerys.  Emilia Clarke is evolving in the role, there is certainly something reptilian about her performance this season that I am really enjoying.  I also liked the toned down version of Daario - though I do wonder whether simplifying this aspect of the story could cause headaches down the line.  I enjoyed the additional scene with Daario and the second sons, but I think the theories here are built around some lazy dialogue (every D+D episode has one particular phrase that gets repeated in different places - or so it seems).
KL was fantastic as usual.  It was nice to see almost all of our regular players down there being featured.  Though this season is seriously lacking Varys.  I really like where they are taking Cersei this season, but I think that due to her reduced screentime, that the casual viewer will not have been paying attention to Cersei's increasing paranoia.
My big problem with this episode is really the choice of scenes to include.  Why not have Sam the Slayer and Osha's monologue in the same episode?  It seems quite tacked on to have included this scene at the end of this episode.
Also where on earth is Catelyn Stark, I really thought that S3 would be 'her' season but so far she has appeared for what... 20 minutes?
955	sastelise	2013-05-20	Finally, a good episode! I gave it a 9. My only compliant is that they didn't spend enough time on the Hound and Arya. But I continue to be impressed with Dany, whom I didn't apreciate as much in the books. Her bathtub scene, along with Brienne's a few episodes ago, are the only  scenes where the nudity doesn't seem gratuitous. Both ladies are portrayed as empowered subjects rather than objects.
956	shiola	2013-05-20	8.5, rounded up to 9 for Peter's masterful acting in the Wedding.

957	Greyjoy67	2013-05-20	4/10What I liked:CerseiSam's sceneThe music when Daario swore fealty to DaenerysThe rest was awful. The writing was cringeworthy, they cut out some of the best lines, Tyrion is just embarassing to watch (not in the way the writers intended), and once again the female nudity felt forced and sexist.Also Daario is absolutely hideous.The writing was cringeworthy? Are people expecting Shakespeare or something?
958	I love Cersei	2013-05-20	Such a nice and clean Hound, with Arya in his lap like he was Old Nan. We need a lot of anger, and better make-up. Just dirty finger nails doesn't do it.  ---
Jorah. +
Dany. Every scene. And her speaking Dothraki. +++
The Titan's Bastard. Genius. Pity that actor wasn't cast as Daario, or could at least live to die another day by Selmy's hand. Anyway, wonderful portrayal. +++
Daario - Not sure. Feels more of a bard than a leader of warriors. I seem to not like him, which may be a good sign given that I never liked him in the books. The way he popped up in Dany's tent just like that felt cheaply executed though. -
Davos reading. +
Gendry. Relax man, it's just leeches! His whole scene with Melisandre was boring and overdramatized. ---
Liked Margaery smiling left and right during Cersei's little chat on the Reynes of Castamere. Those two would be such a nice sister pair, would love to see them mud-wrestling. +
Awkward wedding feeling wasn't bad, even with Joff taking that footstool and Sansa kneeling. +
Drunken Tyrion! Awesome! +++
Shae taking his pillow = Sansa's dress out under his head. Wonderful. +
Portrayal of Sansa and Tyrion's behavior. Tyrion is such a nice guy. One could think Sansa is to fall in love with him right away. Don't. Like. It. ---
Drunken Tyrion again just to add more plusses. +++
Joffrey Cocksure. Wonderful acting. I want him to stay king forever. +++
Gilly and Sam's chemistry, their talk, the raven setup. +++
The White Walker - always thought they look really cheap. The "fight scene" was lame, no sense of fear at all, and when the episode finished without the threat of more Walkers and Coldhands to the rescue, that was a major letdown (even if we should get him next episode). ---
Overall I did like that many scenes weren't so rushed this episode. On the other hand, I didn't like to not see character's I wanted to see. So this seems to be neither plus nor minus. Ultimately though, no Theon was one of the best things this episode. +
Bottom line: Last week's episode was weak, this week's was so even more. While watching I actually thought that I shouldn't waste my time with the series any more and just read the books again. I know the former will never happen though because I'm too curious, and because I like many of the TV characters.
959	Ser Shaft of Hightower	2013-05-20	I can't believe all the up-tight nitpickin!to y'all that voted a 6 or lowerI love you guys and I'm going to sound like a bit of a dick here, my apologies in advance:WHAT ON EARTH do you want? a whole other show? LOLIf this doesn't do it for you then might as well give up on it nowYES - tyrion and stannis and sansa are different than in the books, Lots of things are; because it's not a book nevertheless,  they do 90% of the SAME critical junctures as in the books, ultimately. the plot has to hook up bottom line:GRRM isn't Mr Perfect. Some depictions in the show really are improvements. Some are not, absolutely...and guess what? that's OK!It's OK because the only freaking way this series gets made at all is by HBO - who else can do it better...AT ALL???  YOU???!!! ME??!! LOLOLOL
960	Where Boars Glow	2013-05-20	Loved the episode. 9.5
I thought this TV dario was vastly superior. I actually could beleive why Dany was intrigued by his base cunning and swagger. In the books I always had a hard time understand what Dany was doing with this clown.
Sam the slayer scene was awesome. I was a little bummed they cut the bit about Wildlings not naming children until a year in. Although they did make good use of comparing Randell to Craster.
As for the wedding cloak....i don't think there was a way around it for times sake. The only idea I had was they could have had tyrion fumbling at it...tugging...then cut scene and come back to it to show a period of time took place and she did her small subtile protest left to her. All and all I was fine with the change.
961	Where Boars Glow	2013-05-20	4/10What I liked:CerseiSam's sceneThe music when Daario swore fealty to DaenerysThe rest was awful. The writing was cringeworthy, they cut out some of the best lines, Tyrion is just embarassing to watch (not in the way the writers intended), and once again the female nudity felt forced and sexist.Also Daario is absolutely hideous. Really? You hated the Hound and Arya scene? That was incredible?I had forgotten to mention Cersi too. I thought that scene was well played even with the slight changes to the story of the Reigns of castemere to make it fit
962	sausagekingchi	2013-05-20	Robb's "betrayal" to him is bigger in the show.In the show Stannis knows that Ned was a 100% supporter of his claim ...   Just wondering why you think Robb's betrayal to him is bigger on the show as opposed to the books.
963	Nictarion	2013-05-20	It was ok i guess. I gave it an 8.Finally get to see Sam the Slayer, but nobody there to see it happen!!!!!!! So i dont think he will get given the name in tv.Too distracted by Danny and Mel and that random whore.Daario is a clown. So wrong. All i can see is 'teeth'.Gilly saw it, she can tell people. They completely toned Daario down from the books, if you think his show counterpart was a clown, what is book Daario, with blue hair, forked beard, and gold teeth?
964	Nictarion	2013-05-20	Good episode. I found Tyrion to be funny for the first time in far too long. Sad what they did to the Titan's Bastard /frown5.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':frown5:' /> And SO GLAD that someone FINALLY acknowledged that poor forgotten Balon is actually one of the damn kings!!!!I know, right. Maybe they should have cut one of Theon's 15 torture scenes and gave it to Balon, at this point some show watchers probably forgot all about him.
965	sausagekingchi	2013-05-20	Absolute crap.Unnecessary gratuitous sex scenes from Melisandre given with the most flimsy justification(I need to trick him into having sex with me, to tie him up for sum reesin hur dur).Tyrion has become vanilla ice cream, whitewashed into oblivion.Sam vs The Other scene was a total disappointment.Eliminating Coldhands from the show, another tick in the slow and steadily gaining list of reasons why this show is becoming increasingly less complicated and easy to digest.Terrible. 4/10This episode was so bad, it's almost put me off wanting to watch the show altogether.  Why do you assume they have eliminated Coldhands?  In the books Coldhands doesn't show up until later and then it happens only after Sam and Gilly encounter the wights (who don't die from obsidian) and Coldhands comes in and saves them.  Still plenty of time for that and this scene ultimately allowed Sam to kill an Other, which they skipped earlier in the series.  IN fact, they ended the show with Sam and Gilly running away out of fear, who is to say Coldhands isn't following them and will show up next time we see Sam.  Just a bit premature to say that Coldhands has been eliminated.
966	Talbot	2013-05-20	Why do you assume they have eliminated Coldhands?

967	Dru	2013-05-20	9 for me. Thought it was great. Didn't think the nudity was out of place at all. Went with the plot fine and thought the acting and writing was amazing this episode. Some people should probably just stop watching the show. If they did, then I guess they wouldn't have anything to bitch about and be miserable. So I guess they will continue watching what they don't like.
968	A Redeemed Hound	2013-05-20	Wow.  It was more than obvious Coldhands is coming.  He will be the season ender.  Do not expect to see Sam and Gilly next episode.  They'll be back for episode 10.
My only complaint this season has been the same for every season.  They are having a terrible time with Bran's story, which I found fascinating in the books but simply nonexistent on the show.
This season though is easily the best.
969	Death by Cupcakes	2013-05-20	Ah, the leeches scene:
In the book, Melisandre is possibly hundreds of years old, does not need sustenance, is immune to poisons and extreme temperatures.
In the show she is now forced to trickery/sexual baiting to get royal blood... thats not worthy of her.
The Burning of the Leeches: Not that impressive either. I would have wished a something like the scene where she showed Stannis the vision in the flames; that one was a lot more powerful, erotic even. Honestly, I wish they would have used Gendry in the original Edric Storm role and kept the leeches between Stannis and Melisandre.
Besides, how much blood did they suck, exactly, in those 30 seconds between being applied and removed again?
The Marriage:
The actual ceremony was way too short, Sansa entering the Sept and getting her coat and thats it? Granted, there is no need for the full thing, but at least a short speech of the Septon would have fleshed this out a lot.
And Sansa kneeling actually gave the whole wedding a lot of dignity, probably more than if Tyrion had used the ladder which Joffrey took.
Daario:
I must admit I actually hate him in the book. Every time he opens his mouth it is extremly annoying. I also think he will betray Daenerys. The one in the show is too nice for my taste.
Thats only the negative points, of course, there was a lot awesome things as well.
970	sausagekingchi	2013-05-20	Wow.  It was more than obvious Coldhands is coming.  He will be the season ender.  Do not expect to see Sam and Gilly next episode.  They'll be back for episode 10.My only complaint this season has been the same for every season.  They are having a terrible time with Bran's story, which I found fascinating in the books but simply nonexistent on the show.This season though is easily the best.I agree that the storyline they have cut short the most is Bran (followed by Jon, but they've done a decent job this season of getting his back on track with his relationship with Ygritte).  The problem with Bran's storyline is it would involve a tremendous amount of FX to pull off and make it convincing and that is simply out of their budget.  They'll need to figure out how to get the audience to reconnect with him and his storyline since we all know it will be extremely important.  I'm very curious to see how they handle that.
971	sausagekingchi	2013-05-20	Ah, the leeches scene:In the book, Melisandre is possibly hundreds of years old, does not need sustenance, is immune to poisons and extreme temperatures.In the show she is now forced to trickery/sexual baiting to get royal blood... thats not worthy of her.The Burning of the Leeches: Not that impressive either.

She admits to it during her internal monologue in ADWD.  We all know the sword is BS and that she doesn't really know what she is seeing in her visions the vast majority of times.  Her real powers only really kicked in once she reached the Wall.
972	protar	2013-05-20	Screw it, giving it a 9. Wish there was an 8.5 option though. Great episode overall with few real complaints. Dany great, Dragonstone great, Sam great.
The wedding was very good but I wish they would stop whitewashing Tyrion.
973	Moseh Khayim	2013-05-20	8. Could have been a 9, but the expected Coldhands did not show up. 
+ Tyrion/Sana wedding.
+ Mel naked (better than Dany imo).
+ Boobiehilt.
- No Coldhands.
- No lead up to the RW.
- Daario = Jaqen?
974	KnightsOfDany	2013-05-20	Near perfect 9 all the way
975	johnnysd	2013-05-20	Wow.  It was more than obvious Coldhands is coming.  He will be the season ender.  Do not expect to see Sam and Gilly next episode.

They are having a terrible time with Bran's story, which I found fascinating in the books but simply nonexistent on the show.This season though is easily the best.I think they are about as good as they can with Bran. It would be cool to start using Bran's dreams to fill in some of the exposition that will eventually be needed.
976	kevin1989	2013-05-20	Give it a 9, everything was perfect, but why did Mel put a leech on Gendry's private part? This is not the Mel from the books.
977	The Boar of Gore	2013-05-20	Better on a second viewing...
978	Ashas Globetrotter	2013-05-20	Very strong- give it a 9.
I still don`t get why people react to the nudity scenes- do they forget that the books are filled with sexploitation?
I really hoped it was the Other and not coldhands, because I was afraid they would drop Sam the Slayer. Beauuuuuuutiful scene.
I agree with Rob and Cat - They have been toned down too much and viewers will not be able too care as much about them and their futures as in the book. Same as the indifferent,sloppy treatment of the Bran and Rickon alleged deaths in season 2.  So what could be the most shocking scene in tv history next sunday  sadly won`t be, I fear. (but I am stoked as hell nevertheless, of course ;P)

979	Honourable Ser	2013-05-20	Where do I start... I loved every single minute of it. Even Daario, who I loathed with a violent passion in the books, impressed me hugely. Peter Dinklage and Sophie Turner were brilliant, as were Jack Gleeson and Charles Dance and...well all the actors in King's Landing this week. Special mention to the whole cast on Dragonstone as well, particularly Stephen Dillane and Liam Cunningham.But once again, I find myself stunned by how much Iain Glen and Ian McElhinney managed to steal the show again. Ser Jorah's quips and barely concealed anger were a joy to behold. As for Ser Barristan Selmy, I give you three words that stole the show, and perhaps the whole series (?)!"Gladly Your Grace..."

980	Lord over Seas	2013-05-20	I'd give it a 7.The beginning i found great, but IMO it went quickly down at the middle of the episode, specially in King's Landing scenes.The 2 things i disliked the most:Changes in charachters, making them seem totally void:Cersei openly menacing Margaery makes her just makes her over paranoid, and possibly destroys the whole future secret plots she creates against the Tyrells.Tyrion still is the 'perfect' hero. And Sansa too. All their flaws have been deleted, making this two charachters pretty plain, and mostly whiny.Free nude scene for Mel. Again making the viewer watch unwanted porn just for it's own sake.The whole episode was pretty good though, the last scenes just made it go up again.Except for this moment: Joffrey telling Sansa soon she's going to have a Lannister in her, so it doesn't matter which Lannister f*cks her. (Implying it's going to be him who rapes her)What the f*ck!? That's the worst mistake i could imagine in the whole series... how come he knows that he's a Lannister? Scriptwriters seem to haven't read the books.

981	Ser Luke.	2013-05-20	8.5/10. 
Fantastic writing. Sam the Slayer was great, and all of Daenerys' scenes were pretty good. I'm not sure if I like who they got to play Daario, but he's done okay so far. 
It's too bad Mero died so soon, I think he had a lot of potential. The Tyrion/Sansa wedding was perfect as well, Dinklage gave it his all and it truly paid off.
982	Talbot	2013-05-20	Well his mother is a Lannister, his court is very Lannister. He has gold hair. He's not that bright. He's at a Lannister wedding. 
He also is a Lannister.
983	Lord over Seas	2013-05-20	Well his mother is a Lannister, his court is very Lannister. He has gold hair. He's not that bright. He's at a Lannister wedding.He also is a Lannister.I don't buy it. If Joffrey knows he's a Lannister, he can't believe he's the rightfull king and thus he can't act like he was. And if he sais that because his mother is a Lannister, it still makes no sense, because the child Sansa would have after his rape would be a Baratheon, like he himself believes he is, not a Lannister. It's still a horrible mistake.
984	David Selig	2013-05-20	Except for this moment: Joffrey telling Sansa soon she's going to have a Lannister in her, so it doesn't matter which Lannister f*cks her. (Implying it's going to be him who rapes her)What the f*ck!? That's the worst mistake i could imagine in the whole series... how come he knows that he's a Lannister? Scriptwriters seem to haven't read the books. IIRC Joff learned it in the second season, from the Stannis letters about the twincest, which he seemed to believe.
985	Jafer Flowers	2013-05-20	Great episode. Would've been nice if the Hound actually said 'bloody wedding' at the end of his scene like the book.
986	Lord over Seas	2013-05-20	IIRC Joff learned it in the second season, from the Stannis letters about the twincest, which he seemed to believe.And still he acts and believes he's the rightfull king. It still seems to me as a scriptwriter's fatal mistake.

Many posts are already anticipating the next shows and are doomed to be disappointed proportionately with how bad they want certain events to be portrayed and how.
988	aFeastForDragons	2013-05-20	Great episode! 
Pros:
Stannis and Davos Scene - Amazing!
The wedding
The Hound and Arya
The Second Sons
Only little nitpicking that got me was Cersei openly threatening Margery but we have to remember this isn't the books. They need to ad things like this to keep people's interest in characters.
989	rmholt	2013-05-20	Coldhands I expect will show up. It might even be exactly like in the book - rescuing Sam and Gilly from wights.
I was a little peeved that if I recall Tyrion's scar correctly they are making it bigger and redder - which would be less distracting if they had started it that way.
Just because Mel hasnt burned Gendry <yet> doesnt mean she wont.  JUST AS IN THE BOOK Stannis held her back so she settled for leeches.  For now.  Just because she didnt kill him now doesnt mean she doesnt want to.	I wonder if she is looking to make another shadow baby - if she does and sends it after Balon Greyjoy I will be a little curious about how the FM turn out in the show.  But it would make sense of the action between Mel and Gendry.
This episode was a study in facial expressions and body language.  Tyrion did the wooden prick thing pretty well.
I kinda wish they had given Daario the fancy dyed and sculpted hair and beard - why not?  But they sure gave him the right knives.

990	rmholt	2013-05-20	And still he acts and believes he's the rightfull king. It still seems to me as a scriptwriter's fatal mistake.No, I think he knows there is nothing to prove he isnt a Baratheon so he is the rightful king. Sociopath, remember? Not a Stannis. In fact, legitimizing Robert's rule used some fancy pedigree detective work when actually he won the kingdom by battle and this was legitimized after the fact. So if you have the Iron Throne it seems it doesnt matter by what means.

And then rebelled against him.  Some family.

994	Hoo	2013-05-20	This show is so well acted, It's hard to give anything lower than a 9 week after week.
995	Spilly	2013-05-20	Pretty damn good episode. Covered a lot of things from the book. I gave it a 9 just because I know what's happening next episode and it didn't have as epic of an ending as Dany freeing her Unsullied. Though still an exhilarating ending. Great Episode.
996	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-05-20	This show is so well acted, It's hard to give anything lower than a 9 week after week.I'd have to disagree even though I also gave this episode a 9, because acting can only do so much given the quality of writing. Charles Dance alluded to that in a Thronecast interview. Fortunately this episode was well written and directed but that hasn't always been the case. It's rare but sometimes they have a couple scenes that are a but difficult to get through because the cheese factor seeps through.But yes, this show overall is one of the best cast and acted I've ever seen, especially considering how completely unconventional some of the characters are.

997	Hoo	2013-05-20	But yes, this show overall is one of the best cast and acted I've ever seen, especially considering how completely unconventional some of the characters are.The writing and stories are bizarre, and sometimes a nonsense, but acting is so good and character development that the show is always legit.cersei Loras scene last night, Tyrion, Bron and Square's brothel gift, Bron and the Hound facing off at the pub, cat weaping by the window.  The story is full of bull, but they pull it off.
998	RottenAppleFossoway	2013-05-20	Finally got to watch it. Gave it a solid 9.
One of the better episodes this season for sure.
Dany's scenes were great and not just because she's smoking hot. 
Liked Daario surprisingly, he's much less flamboyant, quite a bit more subtle, but still has the swagger from the books . Loved that they kept his ridiculous naked lady blades accurate. 
 The wedding and "bedding" we're every bit as uncomfortable as I expected them to be. 
 Drunken Tyrion was great. Loved all of his drunken dialogue in the scene from his defiance towards Joffrey to his scene with Sansa. 
 While the leech scene was certainly a huge deviation from the books, I thought it was effective in moving the plot along and I got what they were going for. 
 As both a Stannis and Dillane fan, I loved his scene with Davos. I know show Stan doesn't get a lot of love on these boards, but he hasn't disappointed me in the slightest really. Aside that we don't get to see enough of him. Dillane's portrayal, to me, is not such a chariciture, if that's the right word, as book Stannis is. I can't wait til they get to the battle in the snow that he saw in the flames, and particularly what comes after.
 Arya and the Hound. I love that little Maisie Williams acting so much that if I ever have another daughter, I'm naming her Maisie. True story. The Hound simply isn't his brother. He doesn't seem quite dark enough though, but I suppose he does soften up a bit in the books at times as well. Rory does a great job playing the part though. His is consistently one of my favorites in the show. 
 The ravens/crows and the weirwood and Sam the freakin Slayer was awesome. 1000 eyes and 1. Loved it. I just wish Grenn was there to see it, but who knows, maybe he was and we'll see it in one of the later episodes. 
 I sure hope we get Coldhands before seasons end though. 
 All in all I thought it was terrific. 
Oh and Cersei and Joffrey are assholes. Which is great, cause I hate them equally in the books too.

999	rmholt	2013-05-20	Finally got to watch it. Gave it a solid 9.One of the better episodes this season for sure.The wedding and "bedding" we're every bit as uncomfortable as I expected them to be.Drunken Tyrion was great. Loved all of his drunken dialogue in the scene from his defiance towards Joffrey to his scene with Sansa.http://www.youtube.c...h?v=rdlHUtmnAnAPeter Drunklage
1000	House Balstroko	2013-05-20	A vast improvement over the last two. The wedding scene and reception were perfect. We finally got to see Sam in action and Dany was awesome as usual in her scenes. Even the additions with Melisandre and Gendry were interesting.  A contender for best episode with 4 and 5. I give it a 10. Next week is sure going to be a blast.
1001	PetyrPunkinhead	2013-05-20	Loved it! I've been waiting all season for Sam the Slayer to show up. And I must say, it was a better slaying (contextually) in the TV show than in the book.

1002	Anarchosaurus Rex	2013-05-21	This episode hit all the right notes. It did not cover a lot of arcs, but what it did cover it did right. Since it was centered on Sansa and Tyrion's wedding, Stannis cursing the usurpers, and Dany with the Second Sons, hopefully next week as much time will be devoted to doing the Red Wedding and Queenscrown as superbly.
Even though Robb and Catelyn did not make an appearance, Sandor's explanation of his intentions to Arya and Cersei's diabolical little chat with Margaery both set the stage for what is coming.
1003	Kenyatta	2013-05-21	I gave it an 8.
At first I had a problem with Sansa kneeling at the wedding scene but the tone between the two leading up to that moment was completely different from the books. They both were a lot more angry and bitter at each other as opposed to Tyrion making a joke about wine and Sansa cracking a smile moments before the ceremony. Her not kneeling wouldn't have made much sense here.
I got no complaints about seeing a naked Melisandre. Matter of fact, she should just walk around naked for no other reason than her body is smokin' hot. Cheers to you, pervert-producer-hack!
Question:  If Sam kills a white-walker in the woods and no one is around to see it, is he really The Slayer?
I'm kinda pissed that Sam didn't get a chance to be a badass in front of his boys Grenn and Edd. Nobody in their right mind will believe what just happened. Now he's going to be called "The Slayer" as a joke by non-believers instead of some hard-earned street cred from people who witnessed the awesomeness first hand. Sam deserves better than that.
I'm a bit torn with tv Daario. I really enjoyed the portrayal of the character on screen, but I can't say that I like the white-washing of his physical characteristics. I don't recall Abercrombie & Fitch model as being a description used by George to describe him. But that's a minor nitpick. He may end up being my favorite before too long.
My favorite line of the night has to go to Cersei: "If you ever call me sister again I'll have you strangled in your sleep." Daaaamn. That's real talk there. You can't say you don't know where you stand after hearing that.
All in all it was a very solid episode
ETA: Honorable Mention for best line of the night goes to Tyrion: "I'm the God of Tits and Wine. I shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel I visit."

1004	Talbot	2013-05-21	And still he acts and believes he's the rightfull king. It still seems to me as a scriptwriter's fatal mistake.Because he's a sociopath/psychopath. Do you really think he gives a shit who his real father is? Kid is on the throne, he's going to act like the king. Is it implied anywhere in Joff's characterization that he would let something like this deter him? Cmon man
1005	GeorgeIAF	2013-05-21	I gave it a 9, everything was well tied together, really liked the final scene, didnt dissapoint me one bit. Looking forward to the big one, too bad its 2 weeks away /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />
1006	gordonah	2013-05-21	An 8 from me this week.
There were some very good scenes, particularly the ones in Kings Landing. Of course that's largely due to there being so many great passages in the book(s), but I'm glad that the TV adaptation retains some of favourites.
There weren't any scenes I thought were weak, but there does seem to have been a return of unnecessary nudity. No problem with this per se, but I alway feel that it's included at the expense of better potential content.
1007	Red Hound	2013-05-21	I want to watch it again before I give it a final score, but it's high, very high. Maybe the highest of the season. Having less jumps between plots makes everything run smoother. I loved every single scene, which is not something I believe I have said about any episode so far in the entire saga. 
I think that Dinklage and Sophie Turner were nothing short of spectacular in this episode. 
About Daario...well, I'm a Ser Jorah fan (Show Jorah, book Jorah was kinda meh), so Daario would be an "enemy", but I think I already prefer him over book Daario.
1008	The Killer Snark	2013-05-21	How good was Peter Dinklage in this? It was if Tyrion had wandered in for an appearance straight from the books.
1009	Cadiva	2013-05-21	Nine out of 10 for me, excellent pacing throughout, some great build up to set pieces (Sam the Slayer was perfectly done imho) and the depositing of his fellow captain's heads by Daario in Dany's chambers. Also liked the scene with The Hound and Arya. Just gave her enough doubt about his motivations to make their journey to The Twins interesting. 
The wedding was brilliantly played by all involved. Joffrey stealing Tyrion's stool was a masterpiece in showing what a little shit he is and also giving that awkward moment when Tyrion has to ask her to knee so she can be cloaked. I don't really care at all about the "whitewashing" of him the show's allegedly done, he's still a totally flawed character and Peter Dinklage portrays that perfectly, loved the "And Now My Watch Begins" line.
Great to see Davos and Stannis' relationship again and I thought the scene with Gendry was fine, if a little long, but can understand they're trying to reference back to the whole King's Blood being powerful stuff of the shadow baby. Will be interesting to see where they go with the leeches/power of the Red God when dealing with the fate of the three usurpers Stannis named.
Loved Sam the Slayer, the ravens foreshadowing and the weirwood tree and thought their flight perfectly ended the episode.
1010	Kaitscralt	2013-05-21	4/10What I liked:CerseiSam's sceneThe music when Daario swore fealty to DaenerysThe rest was awful. The writing was cringeworthy, they cut out some of the best lines, Tyrion is just embarassing to watch (not in the way the writers intended), and once again the female nudity felt forced and sexist.Also Daario is absolutely hideous.My favorite thing about the GoT television series each week aside from the episodes is reading what you have to say about them. /rofl2.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':rofl:' />Til next week!

1011	Grandpa House	2013-05-21	Favorite ep of the season so far. I had multiple book-related-nerdgasms (e.g. Daario's sword hilts) but also was genuinely captivated in terms of the TV show itself.
1012	staffred	2013-05-21	The only complaints I see are people being unhappy when the story drifts away ever so little from the books. I think Tyrion is more interesting than in the books. The same goes for Cersei. Both made more flawed and somewhat likeable and less plain evil/selfish.
1013	flinn	2013-05-21	I give it an 8.  I didn't like that the Hound, Tyrion, and Sansa are all so much nicer than their book versions.  Sansa not kneeling is understandable given what a great perfect guy Tyrion is.  I miss the animosity in their wedding, how they both seemed to briefly hate each other.  It's one of those things that made it interesting and made you wonder "Will he consummate his marriage?"  In the show, I feel there was no chance.  I didn't like that there was no Robb and Catelyn.  I didn't like that Arya and the Hound was so short - I think Arya continues to get the shaft by the show.  Milsandre and Gendry went on way too long when we could have had more Arya/Hound or Robb/Catelyn.I am always stunned by the reactions of the internet as I thought this episode was not nearly as good as the last two episodes (which I had zero complaints with) but it was better than episode 5, which I think I rated a 7.I have a hard time seeing how anyone could rate this show as a 9 or 10.A GOT 8 is as good as most series 10s, but this was not one of the best GOT episodes. I don't like the Daario casting. He just doesn't seem to have the charisma. They should have switched the actors of Jaqen and Daario.

1014	Songlian	2013-05-21	9/10
I thought the Sam bit at the end was dull, and the Mel bits kinda awkward.
But the rest was really good. The wedding was hilarious. My favorites were Lena & Finn Jones. "Nobody cares..." 
And I know there are objections to how (understated) Daario looks, but I just find the actor so hot, I really don't care anymore.
1015	Sir Noone Sword Of The Day	2013-05-21	Good episode though the Melisandre f***ing Gendry was just another example of how much the show over-exaggerates the sex in the series, can't say im complaining a huge amount though.

1018	Hear me Meow	2013-05-21	Excellent episode, 9/10.
Yes, they changed Tyrion and Sansa in some substantial ways, but those were still very entertaining scenes and they worked well. Dinklage was great.
Dany's story had been adapted brilliantly as usual.
The stuff I was less sure about were the Mel/Gendry and the Sam/Gilly. The first was just slightly ridiculous but I guess it was done pretty well all the same. Sam was great, as usual, but I just don't like their Others very much. Not scary. 
It is no wonder this episode was good though, as all the story lines they suck at were absent. No Jon Show, hurray.
1019	Anarchosaurus Rex	2013-05-21	Sansa kneeled because viewers are too petty and judgmental to empathize with someone in her position. "She's such a bitch," etc. Personally, I disliked that they did not have Tyrion remove the Stark cloak and wrap her in the Lannister cloak. She leaves her father's protection and comes under her husband's protection. But minor quibbles aside, the wedding was excellent.
Mel's sex scene was a huge waste of time. If D&D had a boob quota, so be it, but there was far too long of a prelude to it. The inclusion of the leeches was a good way to end that diversion.
It was disappointing that there were no scenes with Robb and Catelyn. I had hoped that we would at least be getting some names of Northern bannermen by this point (Greatjon having been written out and no one else save Roose and Rickard introduced), but I guess the Red Wedding will be mostly about the murder of Robb and Cat and not the massacre of the Northern army. It is a shame, because part of the dramatic horror of the Red Wedding is in all the Northerners fighting desperately for their lives and their king - throwing tables on top of Robb, wielding pieces of meat as weapons, etc. Now there will most likely be none of that. Who knows what will happen with Blackfish and Talisa?*

She leaves her father's protection and comes under her husband's protection. But minor quibbles aside, the wedding was excellent.I disagree. Sansa kneeling was the result of three years of poor writing decisions dedicated to make Tyrion into this white and shiny character he simply isn't in the books. Had Tyrion retained his grey and ambivalent nature Sansa could have refused to kneel without running the risk of being labeled a bitch by most of the fandom and the scene would have been more epic because of that. If the audience is petty and judgemental to her position is because they have make Tyrion so perfect in detrimental  to the character (Margaery talking about his good looks and sexual prowess was the worst example of this).
1022	PatrickStormborn	2013-05-21	If they didn't want Sansa to receive hate for it, why not just make Tyrion unsympathetic during the episode? It's a really simple solution. But the problem is that D&D want to continue whitewashing him.
1023	Maizel	2013-05-21	I think I likedthis episode the least so far, Compared to the other episodes,  I'd give this a 7. Though it;s still better TV than most anything out there. 
I just felt like nothing much happened. The whole Mellisandre/Gendry thing annoys the crap out of me. 
I really liked the wedding scene though,  and Daario seems to be decently cast.

Look, I know he's not like that in the books, and your personal opinion may be that you prefer the grey characters (which is absolutely fine), but a lot of people do like a proper 'hero', so to speak, that they can support. Also, I personally thought that Tyrion's threat to Joffrey showed that he is capable of being a real bastard at times. Even if it was to the villain of the show, I loved it for showing us another side to Tyrion, rather than the hilarious and jocular character that he is most of the time.

There are heroes already in the show, though: Daenerys is freeing slaves, Davos refuses to bend to Melisandre's religious fanatacism, Jaime saves Brienne, Brienne refuses to give up her promise to Catelyn Stark, Robb wants to free the North, Jon Snow sacrifices love for honour, Sam rescues Gilly, etc.So I think it's clear that whitewashing Tyrion was very unnecessary.

But the problem is that D&D want to continue whitewashing him.He is Ned Stark 2.0, someone in some authority to show the audience all that's rotten in KL and wishes they could change it. They have no other "star" to drive that particular thread. Nikolaj just began his character's transformation, so they can't put anything on him. I understand the purpose of the whitewashing, while I absolutely hate it because Tyrion's gray areas are what I find compelling. But how do you build up someone as the savior of KL only to say next season, "No, he's really just a fuckup, the pressure of being cast down as Hand has driven him to his drunken whoring self (little of which we saw in season 1 to begin with)." I don't know if the audience would have bought the reversal.

1027	The Monkey	2013-05-21	9/10. Really good episode after the last two week's disappointments.
Save for the first and last scenes, the who episode focused on just three storylines (Dragonstone, King's Landing and Dany's camp), which I thought was a brilliant move. It really gave the storylines time to breathe and develop. Everything about the wedding was perfect imo, such awesome drama. There were more interesting characters in that room than most shows have in their whole ensemble. The Dragonstone bits were good, but the Gendry/Mel sex scene went on for way too long and was ultimately pointless, and the leech scene didn't have the same dramatic impact as it has on me reading the books.
1028	Rabid Grunt	2013-05-21	The writing was cringeworthyI know, they should stop taking it from the books. Martin really isnt up to the caliber of the show writers (as last weeks episode prooved very clearly).
1029	Greywolf2375	2013-05-21	I don't buy it. If Joffrey knows he's a Lannister, he can't believe he's the rightfull king and thus he can't act like he was. And if he sais that because his mother is a Lannister, it still makes no sense, because the child Sansa would have after his rape would be a Baratheon, like he himself believes he is, not a Lannister.It's still a horrible mistake.It's not a horrible mistake - it is arrogance.  Pure and simple.  It has nothing to do with his real parentage - it has to do with how the Lannisters take 2nd place to no one, including in the Kings heraldry.  His stating he is a Lannister makes complete and perfect sense since the main influence in his ear is all about how the Lannisters are better than everyone else. If he were to get Sansa with child the kid would be Stark as well, but would never be referred to as such because of the Lannister blood - anything else is impure.
1030	Hound Dog	2013-05-21	They've completely fucked up Robb and Cat's storyline. So I wasn't even disappointed when they got zero screen time this season, I wasn't surprised at all. They died a long time ago.Ja, the scene of the RW is going to be a celebration in my house. I wish I could say I will care when it happens, because in the book I remember exclaiming my surprise out loud with a shout!It won't be that great of a surprise, I don't think. In TV things have to be more obvious, as in everything happens for a reason (minus the sex scenes, in this case). So for example, when Bran/Rickon/Osha/Hodor came upon the miller's boys, my friend (non-book reader) said right away that the dead burned bodies were those two boys, not Bran and Rickon. In the book, I'd believed for many chapters that Bran was dead!So now it's quite obvious, with the leeches, what will happen. Something. Though a friend did have to ask me: "Who the hell is Balon Greyjoy?" /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' /> And then when I told him, he said: "Ah. So those three are all going to die then?"
1031	Nox Irradiata	2013-05-21	I want to watch it again before I give it a final score, but it's high, very high. Maybe the highest of the season. Having less jumps between plots makes everything run smoother. I loved every single scene, which is not something I believe I have said about any episode so far in the entire saga.I think that Dinklage and Sophie Turner were nothing short of spectacular in this episode.About Daario...well, I'm a Ser Jorah fan (Show Jorah, book Jorah was kinda meh), so Daario would be an "enemy", but I think I already prefer him over book Daario.I agree. With all the awesomeness of the King's Landing, Dragonstone, and Dany scenes, I didn't miss Bran, Jon Snow, or Robb at all.
1032	Rabid Grunt	2013-05-21	I dont really get the whole "Northern plot is rubbish". Yes, it is not very close to the books, and could be seen as inferior, but it has still brought some brilliant emotional scenes, some pretty badass scenes, and on the whole has been, in my opinion, very enjoyable. Robb is still likable, despite a few minor blemishes, Cat is still tragic (and to everyone who says "shes now just a background character:   1. She is in many scenes in the book too, only we get the first person perspective   2: Just watch the character, and her emotions, especially in the Karstark scenes... you dont need words to portray feelings.), and the whole doomed "war in the north" atmosphere has been done very well indeed. The RW should still be superb, in a morbid sort of way.
1033	Nox Irradiata	2013-05-21	For me personally, I don't think the Northern plotline is bad. I just have a harder time "getting into" the scenes featuring Bran's travels, Night's Watch/Wildlings, or Robb (especially Robb/Talisa).
1034	Lady Arwen	2013-05-21	Overall, I thought this was a marvelous episode. The pacing was good and many important scenes were handled appropriately. Obviously, there were some puzzling deviations (Gendry/Mel getting it on), but I can live with those. 
Also, lovely acting all around. Not a bad apple in the bunch. Of note, Emilia continues to impress and I'm so glad she's settled into the character.
1035	Anarchosaurus Rex	2013-05-21	I disagree. Sansa kneeling was the result of three years of poor writing decisions dedicated to make Tyrion into this white and shiny character he simply isn't in the books. Had Tyrion retained his grey and ambivalent nature Sansa could have refused to kneel without running the risk of being labeled a bitch by most of the fandom and the scene would have been more epic because of that. If the audience is petty and judgemental to her position is because they have make Tyrion so perfect in detrimental  to the character (Margaery talking about his good looks and sexual prowess was the worst example of this).I completely agree. One aspect of why viewers would be so unsympathetic towards Sansa's refusal to kneel is because Tyrion has been made so blameless.
1036	Strytos	2013-05-21	I think the episode was one of the best this season. 9/10
And the episode makes me wonder if it wouldn't be better to focus on fewer story lines/characters per episode in general. Most of the time each plot line gets one (at the most two) scenes per week, which draws out everything maybe more than necessary, and which undoubtedly contributes to common criticisms of the show ("moving too slowly", "nothing happens", etc.).
1037	Leto Atreides	2013-05-21	Very strong- give it a 9.I still don`t get why people react to the nudity scenes- do they forget that the books are filled with sexploitation?I really hoped it was the Other and not coldhands, because I was afraid they would drop Sam the Slayer. Beauuuuuuutiful scene.I agree with Rob and Cat - They have been toned down too much and viewers will not be able too care as much about them and their futures as in the book. Same as the indifferent,sloppy treatment of the Bran and Rickon alleged deaths in season 2.  So what could be the most shocking scene in tv history next sunday  sadly won`t be, I fear. (but I am stoked as hell nevertheless, of course ;P)Books and TV/movie are very different mediums. Writers can  can go a lot further because everything is left to the imagination of the reader. There's no "sexploitation" in the Game of Thrones books. Nobody is going to read them just to see the "naughty" bits. The TV show so far has gone out of its way to shoot scenes which aren't in the book for the sake of showing gratuitous nudity (Petyr and his whores, Joffrey and his whores, Podrick at the brothel, Melisandre + Stannis + Gendry). All of this while material is cut from the book because of "time constraints".
1038	The Dragon has three heads	2013-05-21	Drunk tyrion n was very awkward. I was hoping it was all an 'act' following Tywins lead in giving him a way out of a potential bad situation by hamming it up, but then he kept going with it into the room with Sansa, average scene at best...IMHO.

I was hoping it was all an act and he was following Tywins lead in giving him a way out of a potential bad situation by hamming it up, but then he kept going with it into the room with Sansa, average scene at best...IMHO.Uh huh. A little overacted in my opinion.Sometimes I get the feeling when I'm watching Tyrion this season that Peter Dinklage knows how popular his character is, and the writers know it too (hence making him soo perfect), and so he takes some "comical" liberties with his scenes. Don't get me wrong, he's a fantastic actor, but this season I find him to be quite nauseating. Particularly so in the scene you mention, and taking it along into the bedroom.
1040	The Dragon has three heads	2013-05-21	Yeah to me it would have been so much more effective if he drunkenly opened the door and as soon as it closed behind him he strode to pour himself a big drink, sculled it, and let his anger cool down. Shrug.
1041	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-05-21	The point is he was so uncomfortable and out of his element that he got completely smashed as people tend to do to pass by times of unease and discomfort. It may not be how it goes down in the books, but it's perfectly reasonable given the circumstance and the way they've built up Tyrion.
1042	DarkHaunter62	2013-05-21	Not a fan of book Daario; found TV Daario to be more believable, i.e. more believable that Dany would actually fall for this guy.  Loved the scene with Sam and Gilly and the White Walker.  Their dialogue is genuine and touching, and there was real suspense in the confrontation with the Other.  Great way to close the episode.  I predict that Shireen and Davos will free Gendry, much as Edric Storm is freed in the books.  That will allow Gendry to return to the Riverlands and take up where he left off.  Davos will save himself by arguing that the King must first protect the realm, just as he does in the books, thus setting up the whole Stannis-goes-to-the-Wall plotline for next season.

1045	Aerys Blackfyre	2013-05-22	best scenes:
arya and the hound: fuck the queen, fuck joffrey!
stannis burning the leeches and saying the names of his rivals
Sam becoming the Slayer

It was embarrassing to watch. If they made you feel that way than that was great acting.I think this episode was awesome. Gave it 9/10. Deanerys is fantastic this season.
1047	Honourable Ser	2013-05-22	I love the Northern Story. To me, getting to see more of Robb Stark in the TV series has really helped me empathise with his plight. As for Cat, she's been a background figure and despite this Michelle Fairley manges to convey her emotions through some excellent non-verbal acting. Remember, she's a POV character in the books so a lot of what some people are basing their complaints on is the fact that we don't hear her internal thoughts.
Can't wait for the Red Wedding, in a macabre kind of way.
1048	HopeForSpring	2013-05-22	Excellent episode. It revived my hopes for the next one!
1049	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-05-22	Totally, but it was over acted and too bombastically, to the point where my 3 non book reading friends were like, awkward scene, not well shot or executed, regardless of what happens in the book.A little understated behind the eyes work could have made a drastic difference to the quality of this scene.But hey, whatever.It's supposed to be very awkward /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' /> That scene was shot pretty well, besides perhaos the first second of the shot when you're behind Sansa and Joffrey as they walk the aisle. What didn't you like about the shooting?
1050	Paul Blackfyre	2013-05-22	A solid 8.
1051	The Boar of Gore	2013-05-22	If they didn't want Sansa to receive hate for it, why not just make Tyrion unsympathetic during the episode? It's a really simple solution. But the problem is that D&D want to continue whitewashing him.That would make his characterization inconsistent. You can't just make a character do something illogical and inconsistent with their portrayal up to that point for the sake of manipulating the audience reaction. That would be heavyhanded and poor writing.After all those scenes with Tyrion and Margaery trying to reassure her, having Sansa refuse to kneel would have made her look petty.
1052	Red Knight	2013-05-22	8, only because Dario is not Dario at all ( in looks, his attitude is spot on )
1053	Shadow on the Wall	2013-05-22	9/10. I thought the Tyrion-Sansa wedding was fantastic television. Sure, there were book differences which may cause problems down the line, but in the moment I really enjoyed it.
"And now my watch begins". Perfect.
1054	Head of The Ned	2013-05-22	Best episode since episode 4. Only thing not making it a 10 is the lack of Coldhands. I hope they didn't exclude him from the show and he makes an appearance in one of the final two episodes.
1055	Batavian	2013-05-22	What a difference from a week ago. Great episode. I gave e307 a 1. Rated this a 10.

1056	MuchandMore	2013-05-22	Gave it a one.  Some of the changes these two idiots make are so incredibly bad.  There is no reason whatsoever to not have Barriston kill the Titans Bastard.........NONE!  They're still too busy adding ridiculous sex scenes to every f**king episode to care at ALL about the actual story.   Just another in a long line of memorable scenes we get screwed out of.
1057	Creepy Crawl	2013-05-22	I gave it a 9. Even thought there are a few changes from the book I quite enjoy them. If everything was spot on to the books it would make for some too predictable, boring watching.My fav parts were Tyrion punking out king bitch, and the conversation between the Tyrell's about the marriage to	 Cersei and Loras had me LMAO. Tywin's conversation with Tyrion was funny as hell. There were so many great moments to count in this episode. Oh, and I'm liking Daario Naharis!
1058	rocksniffer	2013-05-22	9/10. I thought the Tyrion-Sansa wedding was fantastic television. Sure, there were book differences which may cause problems down the line, but in the moment I really enjoyed it."And now my watch begins". Perfect.gave it a nine if for nothing else this line. I totally agree it was perfect and dare I say better than the book's treatment of this moment...quite frankly my dears the book sounded like a Rhett Butler moment from Gone With The Wind...according to my number one niece who has read said book multiple times... he was giving a commitment that i didn't expect but appreciated nonetheless... /smoking.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':smoking:' />
1059	Anarres	2013-05-23	I quite enjoyed the episode, so a good solid 7 from me. The Hound getting Arya Stark to smile? Who'd have thought! Davos Seaworth at last having a mature conversation with Stannis Baratheon was also nice to see, and his point about the timing of Stannis' act of mercy was quite good. The general awkwardness of the Tyrion Lannister and Sansa Stark wedding was pretty well captured, with nice touches like Tywin 'always critical of his son' Lannister not tolerating any snickers about Tyrion's lacking height and Cersei Lannister threathening to have Margaery Tyrell killed in no uncertain terms. Joffrey Baratheon's threats and schemes are so juvenile that he doesn't become personally threathening in a way people like his grandfather are; it's just annoying now.
I wasn't as fond of the drunken Tyrion scenes, or of Melisandre's antics (What's that about keeping the lamb calm, again? Gendry was screaming like a madman!), but what disappointed me most about this episode was the extremely convenient way the Second Sons confrontation played out for Daenerys Targaryen. I'm curious to see how this story goes on in future episodes, surely the mercenaries will have a few questions about this sudden shift in their organisation?
The focus on a smaller number of characters was quite welcome. I wouldn't mind if they carried this forward into the next season.
1060	Greyjoy67	2013-05-23	What a difference from a week ago. Great episode. I gave e307 a 1. Rated this a 10. /stillsick.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':stillsick:' />

I wouldn't mind if they carried this forward into the next season.The thing about keeping the lamb calm was to convince Stannis that she had no interest in torturing Gendry when she killed him.  She was persuaded not to kill him.  Now, I'm not sure if her analogy with blood was supposed to cross over to Gendry and leeched blood.  Anyway, I think it is a stretch to try to force the sacrifice analogies at all much less with the leeching except she didnt want to terrorize the lad. I cant figure why he was so freaked by the leeches. Perhaps she let him be freaked out so blaming Davos would be more convincing.  But leeches are often used medicinally.  As a denizen of Flea Bottom I cant imagine he hadnt been leeched - as an apprentice who had received double the pay for him unless he had never been sick.  Anyway, he had probably experienced worse. Maybe he was freaked because he was nervous and not exactly sick. Maybe Mel thought the wine and her charm would chill him out.  Who knows?
1063	Duncan Disorderly	2013-05-23	Daenerys in the bath. Best strategically placed nipples EVER!
1064	Valar Morghulis Not Today	2013-05-24	I gave it a solid 8.Really enjoyed the scene with Davos and Stanis, thought that was excellent. Very few faults I could pick with it, disappointed Sansa knelt, but could see why she did.  I think my unsullied friends were expecting it to be the end of Samwell so were pleased when he became Sam the Slayer, but we were all shouting after it that he left the knife behind - which was ridiculous!  Also I had to remind them of the knife and what it was afterwards, would have been better if it was fresher in their minds I think.  Quite a usual gripe that Melisandre didn't need to be naked for her scene, it was almost like filling in the boob quota again. I have to say I really didn't understand Daario's character in the books, but he has been really well cast and I can now see it.  Maybe I should have given the episode a 9, there was so little wrong with it and a lot was done really well.
1065	Conchobar	2013-05-24	Gave it a one.  Some of the changes these two idiots make are so incredibly bad.  There is no reason whatsoever to not have Barriston kill the Titans Bastard.........NONE!  They're still too busy adding ridiculous sex scenes to every f**king episode to care at ALL about the actual story.   Just another in a long line of memorable scenes we get screwed out of.Did you just have a bad day?
1066	Definitely Mayhaps	2013-05-24	9. Out of 10.
Bloody brilliant, every scene felt important to the story, every actor (even Clarke) was on top form. Sandor/Arya was a bit weak but then, I have very high expectations for this pairing and they've still got time.
The wedding was amazing, I absolutely loved it. In the way, the whitewashing of Tyrion mostly paid off here because in the books he was very protective of his new wife. His display of anger towards Joff and his subsequent reaction was also fantastic. Castermere story was wrong but that is a minor complaint. Lack of Ser Dontos was weird in my opinion; it would have made the guests, as well as Joffrey of course, laugh even more and make it even more embarassing for Sansa and Tyrion. They've introduced him, why not utilise him?
Sam the Slayer was great, despite the fact Edd and Grenn weren't there. Strange there wasn't any more wights so to give way to introducing Coldhands but all in all, a very strong finale, same as last weeks.
The Dany storyline is again great. It seems to be going from strength to strength. I find it a fascinating watch. And Daario. WOW, what a phenomenaly good casting! Seriously think D&D can ACTUALLY write a better relationship between Dany and him on TV than George ever could in the books.
As others have said, would've liked a Robb/Cat/Tullys/Talisa scene arriving at the Twins, to set us up for you know what.
Overall, much much better than the Climb, Bear and the Maiden Fair and pretty much every other episode this season. With less filler and more action, as well as being pretty faithful to the books even in the Gendry/Mel scenes, 'Second Sons' was brilliant. Here's hoping 'The Rains...' is even better.
1067	SerArthurHeath	2013-05-24	Gave it a one.  Some of the changes these two idiots make are so incredibly bad.  There is no reason whatsoever to not have Barriston kill the Titans Bastard.........NONE!  They're still too busy adding ridiculous sex scenes to every f**king episode to care at ALL about the actual story.   Just another in a long line of memorable scenes we get screwed out of.This was in no way a histrionic overreaction with basically no rationale and based, apparently, around the omission of a single quite nice but not necessary and frankly not even that memorable scene from the books, was it?The notion of voting something like this show as a 1 is utterly ridiculous. You can say you don't enjoy all the changes but a 1 means, I think on any scale of 1 to 10, that it was literally as bad as it could possibly be with no redeeming features. I can't believe that a real person could actually feel that, especially one that seems to think of themselves as a fan of the book...
1068	rmholt	2013-05-24	I liked they put in some of Mero's banter but I note they put in very little of the backtalk Dany answered with.  Interesting to have her just answer with a patient smile.  Interesting to bring in such a character with a lot of seeming potential only to kill him off right away.
In the book Coldhands rescues Sam and Gilly from wights.  In the book they did think they were in the clear once the Other was dead. So there's room.
People were lamenting the absence of the Death by Dragonglass of the Other prematurely - just because it was a little out of sequence relative to the book.
1069	First of My Name	2013-05-24	Loved it, they aced the wedding and the ending.
1070	gwenyth	2013-05-25	this is one the few episodes that never had a scene where I went "why did they need this". Keep it up, GoT!Second that - why I gave it an 8.  Amazing how much better the pace is when they don't invent pointless cutesy scenes like Margaery's little "joke" with Sansa.   I wasn't bored this episode, which I can't say about most of the others this season.
1071	Count Balerion	2013-05-25	Gave it an 8. Who knows, maybe on the rewatch on DVD I'll jack it up to a 9. Depends on my mood.
I like everything with Daenerys -- although Daario's voice is a little high. I like the wway she keeps her cool when the guy suddenly turns up.
Wedding decent, though yes, drunk Tyrion did seem a bit overdone.
Good final scene. And I'm sure Coldhands will turn up in due course.
I also liked Cersei's not terribly veiled threat to Margaery and Davos psychoanalysing Stannis, not to mention that Stannis is a bit more like Stannis now.
1072	Phaing	2013-05-26	Gave it a 9, and might have made it a 10 if the Sons had not behaved so ridiculously.But hey, there are no tens, eh?Much controversy on YouTube about Dani doing her first nude scene since Season one. I think its cool that she's not leaving that burden entirely to actresses that have not "made it" yet. It also made a contrast to earlier scenes where she was so much... less, than is the case now.She's making the transition from child-bride to Joan of Arc both believable and fun to watch.And damn, isn't it great that the Hound finally admitted that he tried to help Sansa? Funny how Arya thought he was taking her back to Kings Landing, she was the only one in the world who didn't know that was an impossibility from the word go.Sam is stil wandering towards Castle Black, while John, who went the long way, is already past the wall.Funny how that works out, ain't it?
1073	Carey Snow	2013-05-26	Gave it a 9, and might have made it a 10 if the Sons had not behaved so ridiculously.But hey, there are no tens, eh?Much controversy on YouTube about Dani doing her first nude scene since Season one.

1074	awearyman the wanderer	2013-05-26	I really cant rate this season with a good conscience. Its fallen very far below what my expectations were going into this season. I hope they can salvage the mess they made this year with the two episodes they have left.

1077	MockingbirdSpider	2013-05-27	I really cant rate this season with a good conscience. Its fallen very far below what my expectations were going into this season. I hope they can salvage the mess they made this year with the two episodes they have left.I must also say that I'm slightly disappointed with this season so far. It's certainly not been a huge letdown or anything like that and is without a doubt still insanely good and better than 99% of what's on TV these days, but I can't help but feel a bit disappointed now that its almost over and there's so little time to conclude some story archs. The story lines seem to be all over the place, some apparently going nowhere for ages (Theon, Bran...). I just feel like the show's pace has been way too slow this season - especially from episode 5 onwards. After all that's been said prior to its airing ("This is the season we have been hoping to make ever since the show started" etc.) the season failed to live up to the expectations, at least for me. But, as I said, it's still very very good and entertaining.(this is all coming from a non-book reader btw)
1078	oierem	2013-05-27	So, was the scene with Sam written by Martin?
1079	Serr Parker	2013-05-27	After seeing it for a second time I thought an eight, Salvers Bay, Kings Landing and Dragon Stone are easily my favorite areas of this season can't get enough of them, couldn't care less about Jon and Sam their stories don't get good till the end of book three, looking forward to the Red Wedding just because I'm sick to death of Robb Talisa scenes. Did miss Theon and the Bastard this episode but I suppose there's only so much torturing they can show before it loses it's shock value.
1080	Boi	2013-05-27	Gave this episode a 3. Sorry to come on here and rock party. Honestly I thought I would try to get to the source. having my concerns answered. Hoping that maybe the big man can lay down the law. This from when this current episode comes accross this terribly. Forgive me but what a dreadful episode. George RR Martin is probably my favourite fantasy author showing his wonderful world to be beautiful, brutal and without remorse. The hero's are often just ordinary people who are caught within the greater mecahanisms and schemes of design. Who are often faced with the inevitabilities of fight, live, or die being true to nature in it's themes. Not by walking off into the sunset while living happily ever after. I love this both from in the book much more so, and also through this TV adaptation. Which until this current episode has been quite good by comparisons.
My complaints with this episode are:
Davos Seaworth being thrown into Dragonstone Keep dungeon. This was quite pointless, an excerise in wr'eading he can now do his A,B,C's, a result. Why was he put in there showing Stannis Baratheon as nothing more then a whimsy?
Daenery's bless her, will slay evil slavers, but not very vulgar men because she is seeking allegiances?
Daario is a super ninja. Evading Unsullied, Bloodriders and Knights so viewers can sneak a peak. Giving head or getting a'head dunno can't quite work that one out? How was she so easily approached?
Unforgiveably the show is now a song of Fire. Desciption. We know how scary the dragons are, we have seen R'hllor make baby shadows, and also resurrect the mortally wounded. Where is the Ice? Whitewalkers are nothing more then craven slayed zombies. These Whitewalkers have no skill or any intelligence. The zombie didn't pursue the threat the sword wielder, the only interest it had was in the baby. One can assume if Gilly gave her baby to the evil zombie, it would simply walk away. Comes from Castor forgetting to pay his due's, but being as brainless as shown. How would it have know? The Whitewalker had no weapon to speak of, was alone, and was about as frightening as your average cartoon. The CGI shown was entirely masked in FX, look at all the snowflalkes magically disappear. Although importantly missing the very aspects of that horror.This from being a walking nightmare. Why are the words? Winter is coming, The Night Is Dark and Full Of Terrors. Tales passed down for generations as warning. With 600ft high icewalls made to keep those monster out, or was that wall built for the grumpkins and snarks? Now lads, a craven can easily stab one in the back and watch it explode? Your average brainless zombie, requiring possibly that fabled dragonglass or silver bullets whatever load ballista they are quite harmless. Excuse my skepticism, but I am dumbfounded at this episodes conclusion
The episode had moments of great TV. I really enjoy when the history and lore of Game of Thrones is brought into the TV. The dialogue of the song of rains castamere was absolutely great. Overall sadly as an episode was seen as terrible despite it's few moments

1081	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-05-27	Davos was imprisoned by Stannis in the books. He is also freed later for no other reason than being loyal and giving honest advice.
Dany doesn't kill Mero and the other two because their allegiance will mean taking Yunkai much easier. This is exactly how it works in the books except the Stormcrows don't exist.
Daario does basically the same thing in the books except he doesn't sneak into her tent so easily. The end result is just the same. I like how Daario can't be a ninja but we can live within a world where faceless men exist.
We've seen the white walkers be more strategic and intelligent than ever in the books. Always the artists. Don't know wtf you're talking about here. We don't know anything about the white walkers from the books really. It's all a mystery. We know way more about R'hllor.
So in the same post you praise GRRM for being excellent (which he is) you also argue that everything he's done is bad on the show.
I love show criticism as long as it actually makes sense and doesn't show an unreasonably illogical adaptation bias.

He will now sit on the iron throne I'm so sureDany doesn't kill them because they weren't so vulgar.Daario which we aren't discussing as a character. Is as bad a casting as Jojen and Myra almost the opposite of descriptions. No in the books he doesn't evade Dany's entire army using super ninja skills. He kills his capitans with his dual wielded swords beheading them, yes. If he can sneek through her camp, why has nobody else? This content a 12 year old won't question being roused from the peek. Full awards for that logicNo we haven't seen enough of the WhiteWalkers. Though admittedly if a 600 ft high icewall is made with plenty of warning and words passed down for generations.You would expect that creature to be more scary then some feebled pedo hermit. Having no intellegence while showing its ass so it gets ripped a new one, shattering. Craven Sam knows the backstab. Hey lads, Westeros is now trembling at the Horror of CGI. We know enough of WhiteWalkers from the tales of Gran to Bran. Since when is a Facelessman = Ice, now your giving me demons.I critise what doesn't make sense, those sceens didn't make any senseI praise GRRM for making every single detail, thread together like a tapestry when read, making clear and perfect sense. While formulating a wonderful and epic read. Not some butchered smut tv show, which some sceens like the above barely play out to any coherence

1083	Ran	2013-05-29	With votes tapering off, this episode ends up at a 8.35 with 714 votes in.
Season average to date is 8.06 after 8 eight episodes. At the same point, season 1 rated an average of 8.37 while season 2 rated 7.8. So it's almost exactly in between those two seasons.
I am actually considering a Season 1 Rewatch thread and related polls for the summer, to get people to go back and watch the first season in light of the following seasons, and re-evaluate their scoring. I'd be interested to see whether opinions during the first season were less critical due to the novelty and excitement, or more so.
1084	Wintermute1010	2013-05-29	Davos was imprisoned by Stannis in the books. He is also freed later for no other reason than being loyal and giving honest advice.It was Melisandre that imprisoned Davos after she saw him coming to kill her in the flames. Stannis doesn't see Davos until about half way through the book.

1085	The Lord of Cinder	2013-05-30	9/10
One of the best episodes so far together with episode 4 and 5, though I hope the next one will be better than any before it. I don't really have anything big to complain about, the only thing I felt a bit bugged about was the scene where Melisandre seduced Gendry. It wasn't necessary for any other reason than to have another nude scene with Carice. I thought she was going to drug him, which would have worked, considering she didn't die of the poison in the first episode of season 2 (correct me if there's something I've forgotten about Melisandre's poison resistance).
Everything else was really great. I have no complaints about the opening scene with Arya and the Hound, and they included a lot of small things from the books (Arya trying to kill the Hound with a rock, the Mountain being way worse than the Hound, and the Red Fork part).
I liked all Daenerys scenes (especially the bathtub one, heh), and Daario seemed well cast. I didn't mind the changes from the books, since it's understandable that the series has to simplify some minor plots due to time and money. And is it just me, or are they spending more time on details this season, because they actually remembered to include Daario's naked-woman sword and arakh.
The conversation between Stannis and Davos was great, and as some interviewer on the internet said: the way the scene is filmed makes it look like Stannis is trapped, a prisoner of his duty. Also a good scene to make the unsullied understand that Stannis is not a manic zealot who is willing to do anything to get the throne, at least not without speaking with good ol' Davos first. I also like swapping Edric Storm with Gendry, makes the viewers more invested than if it was someone we didn't care about.
My favorite part had to be the wedding scenes in King's Landing, which surprised me, considering I didn't care that much for Tyrion and Sansa's wedding in the books. I guess it is more interesting to watch awkward weddings than to read about them (don't kill me). Every scene was great. We didn't get the entire "well, this is awkward" scene in episode 6, but we did get a whole bunch of awkward, uncomfortable and comical scenes in this one. "I am the god of tits and wine" and "now my watch begins" made me laugh, hard. Sansa kneeling, I can understand the change, after all we don't get to peer into Sansa's mind in the show, and Tyrion is pretty whitewashed (which should make his change in character in the next seasons have a bigger impact), so many TV-viewers would get mad at her. Joffrey is back again, creepier than ever. Olenna trying to figure who's what was priceless, and Loras trying to break the ice with Cersei made me feel a bit sorry for him.
And finally, Sam the Slayer. No Coldhands bugged me at first, but I guess we'll see him next episode (just to have another big moment to trick the unsullied into believing nothing more will happen). I didn't think the White Walkers at the end of season 2 looked close to as creepy and menacing as they could have, but in this scene the TV-adaptation Walker looked perfect! The entire scene had a chilling atmosphere, first with the ravens quorking, then suddenly becoming silent, only to hear the ghastly crackling noise from a White Walker. And Samwell confronting the Walker reminded a lot about Samwise facing Shelob in LotR, which is awesome!
All in all, great episode, and my expectations for the next one may be too high ...
1086	Mladen	2013-05-30	I am actually considering a Season 1 Rewatch thread and related polls for the summer, to get people to go back and watch the first season in light of the following seasons, and re-evaluate their scoring. I'd be interested to see whether opinions during the first season were less critical due to the novelty and excitement, or more so.I also considered Rewatching Sansa thread with book spoilers, but I renounced that idea, when I was realized it wouldn`t serve the purpose of re-evaluating the character and seeing it where did it all go wrong. But, if you open rewatch thread, I think it`ll be interesting...

I'd be interested to see whether opinions during the first season were less critical due to the novelty and excitement, or more so.That's a great idea, Ran. For what it's worth, I always believed the first several S1 episodes were overrated around here. Episode 2 especially has unreasonably high marks, while in my opinion it's one of the worst episodes of the entire TV show. Not from the tired purist/non-purist perspective, but simply as an hour of TV.

This topic should open automatically around the start of airing.
1091	theJoker501	2013-05-19	I think that was a pretty badass episode. Tyrion threatening Joffrey was awesome
Sam finally stepped up a little bit, but why the hell did he not pick the dragonglass dagger back up?
Cersei being a sourpuss is hilarious
Side Note: on the sneak peek for next episode I feel like it done some for-shadowing about the whole Robb and Talissa deal. Which I don't know what happens but I think that she is no good.
Great episode though in my opinion.

1097	Tony Soprano	2013-05-20	I thought the wedding was perfect! Just as awkward as it should be. Peter Dinklage did a great job of playing a drunk Tyrion, I loved his constant drunken babbling. When he said that he'd vomited on a girl once... /lol.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lol:' /> 
Sophie Turner was great as well. Even though Sansa didn't have as many lines as Tyrion, we could see how uncomfortable she was just through her facial expressions and body language. She was great. 
I loved the scenes on Dragonstone, especially Stannis' talk with Davos in the dungeons. I had started to lose hope for Stannis after the last couple of episodes, but I think the scene with Davos redeemed him in the eyes of the viewers. He knew killing Gendry was wrong. That's why he went to Davos - so he can be his voice of reason. Also, Stephane Dillane and Liam Cunnigham are just perfect together! I hope we'll see them together again soon.

1104	Arrow	2013-05-21	Speaking as a lagging-behind book reader, I'm almost to the end of the second book and thoroughly enjoying the more complex and deeper characters and story lines - I don't mind a few spoilers showing up here, because the books are so rich in description and complexity of personas that a few spoilers here and there are not going to ruin things for me.
My perception of the story is being back-filled in slowly, and the TV episodes are still full of surprises, and I really kind of like it that way. I have noticed the character of Tyrion has some notable differences in the two versions and I have to wonder where the TV show is going to take him now that they've changed him so much. Intriguing.
It's a shame we have to wait two weeks for the next episode on TV, but that will give me a great chance to catch up in book 3, so it's okay. I guess there's a bit of an advantage to having not read the books before HBO started showing the series.

1106	Duncan Disorderly	2013-05-23	I have a question. At the end when Sam stabs the white walker in the back, was it an obsidian blade? I couldn't make out if it was. I assume it was because they found the obsidian under an old stone marker last season. This led me to think that you need obsidian to kill the white walkers.
Edit to correct typo.

1110	lilbowwow	2013-05-29	Just reposted this from a book spoiler thread I guess so nothing gets spoiled for me.... Anyway....
I have a few questions about Walder Frey and Lord Bolton not particularly relevant to the latest episode, but something I have been thinking about and actually more relevant to "The Bear and Maiden Fair" Episode.
What happened to Frey's men that Stark took in Season 1? Supposedly Robb received about 2000 or so I believe and 400 stayed at The Twins in Season 1. I guess his men left for the Twins after Robb married Talisa in Season 2. And now he is going back for more as supposedly he has a great number? Will that make that much of a difference in attacking Casterly Rock if Walder supposedly has that many men. I guess we may find out next episode the numbers.
Secondly, why would Lord Bolton release Jaime so easily? Bolton released Jaime only if he told Tywin that it was not him who cut his hand off? Sounds like Bolton is scared of Tywin? Is he trying to back out, does he not agree with Robb's tactics lately? Robb surely won't like this if he finds out and I am skeptical how this will play out. I don't see Bolton, the man who flays his captives, as someone who would release Jaime so easily? What the hell?
1111	The Mighty Conch	2013-05-20	So this episode we see the Tyrion-Sansa wedding and of course everyone expects Tyrion to consummate the marriage, which he doesn't. Shae is of course upset at Tyrion for getting married and having sex with a "little girl" and not staying faithful to her (I guess).
BUT THEN when Shae goes to change the sheets and realizes that Tyrion has not had sex with her she seems proud of him and does not seem to bear any bad will to him. SO HOW IN THE WORLD WILL: 
	Spoiler  Shae betray Tyrion by witnessing against him in the trial and sleeping with Tywin? 

Let me know how you guys think this will play out.
1112	Faceless Sam	2013-05-20	she's playing him for the lifestyle.  her facial expression is actually one of triumph and not relief. works for me.
1113	SeventySeven	2013-05-20	Shae is deluded; she actually thinks she has a chance of a life with Tyrion. At first it was cute and understandable, now he's married it's beginning to look pathetic tbh.she's playing him for the lifestyle.  her facial expression is actually one of triumph and not relief. works for me.I didn't interpret it that way. She seemed genuinely surprised and relieved, and then looked at Tyrion and smiled at him. She's in love. I don't have a huge problem with her being in love, but I have a problem with the fact she actually thinks she could be anything more than a girl on the side for Tyrion. It makes her appear stupid, and maybe that's how she's supposed to come across. Still, it's hard to feel for stupid characters.
1114	ServantOnIce	2013-05-20	In the books Shae only did what she did because she was selfish. She wanted something for herself. In the TV show I don't know where they will go with less unless she thinks Sansa and Tyrion are falling in love or they actually copulate.
1115	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-20	In the books Shae only did what she did because she was selfish. She wanted something for herself. In the TV show I don't know where they will go with less unless she thinks Sansa and Tyrion are falling in love or they actually copulate.Book Shae had no real problem betraying Tyrion even though he never consummated the marriage, so I don't see any reason HBO Shae would either.
1116	SilentSense	2013-05-20	HBO Shae is different person though. I was expecting the show to make it obvious Tywin is forcing her to talk at the trial and for Tywin to end up killing her...until Tyrion got her that gold chain.

she would be a noble, Tyrion couldn't do it for her even with all Casterly Rock's gold

1118	The Mighty Conch	2013-05-20	Book Shae had no real problem betraying Tyrion even though he never consummated the marriage, so I don't see any reason HBO Shae would either.That's the thing though, I dont think they have done a good job of making it seem that Shae is very selfish. A post earlier stated it made her seem in love, which I agree with, and that brings into question how or even why she would betray tyrion.I mean, I feel like we have to completely divorce book Shae from what is being portrayed. I think they are too different. I feel like that making Shae genuinely in love with Tyrion is the straw that broke the proverbial camel's back for me.Maybe I am wrong, and they will do an about-face...
1119	Kienn	2013-05-20	I don't get how people presume to know so much about Shae in the books, we never get her PoV and there's lots of reasons for her to do what she did... I just leave it for what it is, a toss-up until we somehow get more info.
1120	YTDN	2013-05-20	Well, when Shae betrays Tyrion it will be after he's been arrested and Sansa's fled, so Shae will be left up the creek without a paddle. Cersei will probably figure out that Shae is Tyrion's 'whore', and Shae will be left with a dilemma: get killed for the sake of a man who (in her mind) wouldn't do the same for her, or sell him out for survival.

1122	mrunderhill	2013-05-20	I didn't interpret it that way. She seemed genuinely surprised and relieved, and then looked at Tyrion and smiled at him. She's in love.

It makes her appear stupid, and maybe that's how she's supposed to come across. Still, it's hard to feel for stupid characters.Book Shae was not in love, but she was far more naive that the Show. Book Shae really seems to believe that Tyrion can marry her and make his lady.
1123	YTDN	2013-05-20	I agree partialyin the books she ended up in Lord Tywin's bed? why?if it was just a way of surviving, why bedding Lord Tywin?Maybe when Tywin speaks to her she tries seducing him so he won't kill her. Or something. It's never explained in the books.
1124	A Man Is A Man	2013-05-20	I've always interpreted Shae as being someone that was maybe hired by Tywin to spy/betray Tyrion from the very beginning (and that's one of the reasons why she's sharing Tywin's bed in the end). I've always interpreted her "love" for Tyrion as just being a role that she is playing and there's no reason to think Show-Shae is any different. She reveals her true colors in the end, and Tyrion kills her for it.
1125	JMJ	2013-05-20	Show Shae is getting more and more annoying. I am sick of those wounded/angry looks she keeps giving Tyrion. Makes me look forward to the scene in Tywin's bed at the end of ASOS. Man, I hope they keep that scene...
1126	lostinwesteros	2013-05-20	she's playing him for the lifestyle.  her facial expression is actually one of triumph and not relief. works for me.My take on it exactly.  For one who was pretty ballsy to start with, she's getting even bolder.  She wouldn't leave Sansa's room when Tyrion came to break the marriage news last episode, stormed right in their room pretty furiously in this episode, and the look I read on her face was definitely one of smug satisfaction.  She had become fairly delusional and come to count on a relatively 'pie in the sky' position, but the events of the last couple of episodes have punctured a huge hole in that.  She's had to face the reality of things a bit more, and she is royally, ahem, pissed.   HBO Shae has been presented in such a golden, ahem, light that I was wondering how they would ever turn her around to show the betrayer she turns out to be.  I was afraid HBO would leave out that part (in which case I was going to be livid), but maybe this is just how they're going to engineer the change in Shae.

1127	Greywolf2375	2013-05-20	I agree partialyin the books she ended up in Lord Tywin's bed? why?if it was just a way of surviving, why bedding Lord Tywin?There's two main theories:1) Tywin is a hypocrite and has been making use of prostitutes on his own (the Hand who had the tunnel to the brothel built).  If Shae has a chance of surviving, aligning herself to the most powerful person in the realm isn't a bad way of doing it.2) Shae is set up by Varys and planted in the bed to make Tyrion even more angry and resentful.How the show will end up handling it?  Who knows.
1128	Janicia	2013-05-20	It is really hard to imagine Tywin and Shae in bed together.  I can imagine this Shae betraying Tyrion at the trial and making a mockery of him, but sleeping with Tywin?  And Tywin sleeping with her?
1129	brandino	2013-05-20	Am I the only one who thinks that Shae is already sleeping with Tywin?  Thus her 'jealousy' is her trying to push Tyrion away so he won't be so upset whenever he finds out?
1130	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-20	No. The way the show is handling this is a 'love story' whereas in the books I never trusted Shae, I always knew she would betray Tyrion at some point. Her character is much different in the show.
1131	HouseHarrison	2013-05-20	They still have a whole season to build up Shae's betrayal. They're going to go a very different route with her then the TV show, but I'm fairly sure will get to the same result.
1132	mrs_serpounce	2013-05-20	Am I the only one who thinks that Shae is already sleeping with Tywin?  Thus her 'jealousy' is her trying to push Tyrion away so he won't be so upset whenever he finds out?You're definitely not the only one who smells something rotten in Denmark with Shae. I always thought Book!Shae's motivations were wholly straightforward. Show!Shae is a lot more wily, and I haven't trusted her from Day 1 (and didn't she tell Tyrion as much?)I do also see some parallels with Shae and Ros and the whole concept of the ladder. Women who were whores who are using their positions to climb out of said status. That said, I definitely think Shae is letting it go to her head a bit more than some, and I think that, just like Ros, it's going to cause her downfall in the end. Play multiple players, and you'll wind up getting caught, eventually. (...and a nice little tieback to the book plot...)
1133	David Selig	2013-05-20	I am starting to think Tyrion won't kill Shae at all. Or if he does, it would be a clear case of self-defence or to save Sansa's life, something to make him look like the hero again.

I don't even know how we're seeing such different things. I sure can. I don't think she's going to go down 'crazy psycho jealous bitch' either. I think there's a side to her we haven't seen yet, where she's playing the long game. There has *got* to be a reason that D&D made her such a different character than Vapid!Book!Shae. And methinks it doesn't bode very well for Tyrion.
1138	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-20	Well, let us see what happens. I'm just saying that AT THE MOMENT I just can't see it. I cant tell the future so I don't know what they will do with the characters,, but at the moment the two characters are 'in love' but I suppose they have a season to change this. We'll see. 
Right now Tyrion, as he is, wouldn't do this. So big things have got to happen.
1139	mrs_serpounce	2013-05-20	I think it's really insulting to reduce someone to x character hater.I think that the fact is, there are a lot of people out here today that are trying very hard to make a point that the show is making a non-hero a hero, and who are exasperated, and for some, quite disgusted with that concept.I'm not reducing anyone to anything, and everyone has a perfect right to like some characters and dislike others /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' /> That's why everyone has an opinion. I just would like to see some middle-ground discussion instead of all the "OMG D&D think Tyrion is a hero and nobody sees how really bad he is!"
1140	David Selig	2013-05-20	I love Tyrion as a character in the books. Not as a person, mind, but as a character he's awesome (until ADWD at least when he bored me to tears most of the time). That's exactly why I hate how they've turned him into a borderline saint in the show and made him so much more boring.

1142	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-20	That's quite rude, I felt I wasn't just 'OMG' and had some genuine opinions on his character in comparison to the book. But perhaps this is not the thread for a Tyrion discussion.
1143	mrs_serpounce	2013-05-20	Well, let us see what happens. I'm just saying that AT THE MOMENT I just can't see it. I cant tell the future so I don't know what they will do with the characters,, but at the moment the two characters are 'in love' but I suppose they have a season to change this. We'll see.Right now Tyrion, as he is, wouldn't do this. So big things have got to happen.Again, I don't agree. I don't think the characters are "in love," per se. I see something a lot more sinister in Shae than I guess a lot of people do. And while Tyrion is "in love," Book!Tyrion was also "in love" with Shae (as best he could be, anyway), and it was what made her betrayal at his trial, and in Tywin's bed, all the more shocking to him - he never saw it coming. I think that whatever Show!Shae is up to, Show!Tyrion won't see it coming, either.Also, Show!Tyrion's "I like living!" speech may be a couple seasons off, but I don't think his character has evolved past it. I think that the show might be focusing on some of his more positive aspects (at the detriment of some others), but at this point in the books, he didn't do anything majorly horrible that's been left out (other than the omission of his participation in Tysha's gang rape, which I did think was a pretty glaring omission). There's a looooooong way to go for his character, and I'm sure that Shae will have a hand in it.I could be completely wrong, but that's why we debate these things. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />

1146	mrs_serpounce	2013-05-20	I love Tyrion as a character in the books. Not as a person, mind, but as a character he's awesome (until ADWD at least when he bored me to tears most of the time). That's exactly why I hate how they've turned him into a borderline saint in the show and made him so much more boring.I agree with you about ADWD. Getting Tyrion back and then having to slog through his chapters there were just... woof. But ADWD, IMO, was Martin's most aimless book out of the five, and I think that really reflected in many characters' arcs (Dany's being another...)As far as Show!Tyrion goes, I guess I just don't see it the same way. I've never thought he was "a borderline saint." (Does a "borderline saint" say things like, "Those are brave men knocking at our door. Let's go kill them!" I can't see that.) I think he might be a little more good than true neutral, but we really haven't gotten into the parts of the book where he really descends yet. How the show handles that will have significant impact upon how I view the show character.
1147	Young Nan	2013-05-20	I think that show Shae is a 100% different person that book Shae.   Show Shae and Tyrion are clearly in love, she is acting jealous and demanding, and Tyrion is reinforcing it, having conversations with her where he apologizes about Sansa, promises Shae he "only has eyes for her" and only thinks of Sansa as pretty from a purely aesthetic standpoint, etc.
They are both acting as if they have a "real" relationship.  So, I interpreted Shae as genuinely jealous of their wedding and genuinely relieved that he didn't bed Sansa.
1148	mrs_serpounce	2013-05-20	he actually has done quite a lot of horrible things in the books at this point, but i won't reiterate them all now as theyve been covered countless times in other threads.We'll have to disagree on our concept of "majorly horrible," then. He's done some bad things, yup, in the context of familal war... But we're not even at Singer's Stew yet (which is where I really see it starting).
1149	JonCon's Red Beard	2013-05-20	Maybe Shae is genuinely worried about Sansa, who after all, is a innocent child, and glad Tyrion did the right thing by not sleeping with her.
1150	Woman of War	2013-05-20	She seemed genuinely surprised and relieved, and then looked at Tyrion and smiled at him. She's in love. I don't have a huge problem with her being in love, but I have a problem with the fact she actually thinks she could be anything more than a girl on the side for Tyrion. It makes her appear stupid, and maybe that's how she's supposed to come across. Still, it's hard to feel for stupid characters.Well, in the books it's Tyrion who has some delusions about Shae's feelings and he is not stupid at all, he is exactly, delusional.And that is what makes the story interesting: A highly intelligent character, who due to his own cruel history, is craving for love and recognition so badly that at times he loses touch with reality and can fool himself into believing that book Shae loves him because he wants it so much.Shouldn't we grant HBO Shae a similiar illusion? Shae for sure is a strong selfmadewoman, not stupid at all who does not realize the reality of the game because she is from another social background. She has delusions about her possibilities, being partially blind just like book Tyrion. Delusions can go very well together with being clever.

1151	SeventySeven	2013-05-20	I see nothing sinister in show!Shae. In the books yes, you could tell she was trying to gain something for herself and just flatter Tyrion to get what she wanted. But in the show she's in love, and also seems mentally challenged or incredibly naive, I can't tell. She actually expects Tyrion not to sleep with his wife, while the whole point of a marriage is to produce heirs. She's ridiculous. I mean, I'm fine with her expressing hurt, I'm put off by the fact that a prostitute actually has the sort of expectations Shae has. ETA:Well, in the books it's Tyrion who has some delusions about Shae's feelings and he is not stupid at all, he is exactly, delusional.I didn't read it like that. I thought Tyrion knew it couldn't be, and was willing to fool himself anyway. Shae gets angry as she actually expects it, which is quite different.Shouldn't we grant HBO Shae a similiar illusion?

She has delusions about her possibilities, being partially blind just like book Tyrion. Delusions can go very well together with being clever.I'm not sure I agree. The sort of life she had would suggest she should be way more grounded than a character like Tyrion, who despite having had hard time did not become a prostitute and he's very rich too. Pampered, even. Different characters suit different expectations, and a prostitute truly believing and expecting what Shae does is laughable to me.

1152	jotabe1789	2013-05-20	The only unreasonable thing is for an apparently low-born whore to think that she can order around one of the richest nobles in Westeros and expect to marry him and be made noble herself. It's absolutely ridiculous in terms of the setting.Wait. Isn't that exactlly what Tytos's mistress did?
1153	David Selig	2013-05-20	Wait. Isn't that exactlly what Tytos's mistress did?No, she didn't expect to marry him IIRC.

I also find her expectations absurd; still, Shae has shown outwardly only mild tolerance for political maneuverings. Note I said tolerance, rather than aptitude... her initial introduction seems to imply she's a lot more than she says she is.
1155	Newstar	2013-05-20	Maybe Shae is genuinely worried about Sansa, who after all, is a innocent child, and glad Tyrion did the right thing by not sleeping with her.Eh, I'd buy that if in the runup to the wedding Shae had made one comment implying she was outraged on Sansa's behalf and not merely her own, but she didn't. She was jealous and threatened, but she was unconcerned with Sansa's fate of being an innocent child sold off into marriage except to the extent that she would herself be affected by it. Shae's anger was about her situation and only her situation..somewhat bizarrely, since in 3x02 she was all protective of Sansa's virtue when it came to Littlefinger and whatnot.Her glee over the non-consummation does seem a bit delusional, since Tyrion's decision to refuse to consummate the marriage had absolutely nothing to do with Shae or some desire to remain faithful to her, not to mention that Tyrion's refusal to consummate the marriage risks putting him on Tywin's bad side (which will threaten Tyrion's position and by extension Shae's), something Shae seems smart enough to grasp, but whatever.I had thought before 3x08 that the hook for Shae's betrayal on the show would be jealousy and resentment over the marriage, but 3x08 seems to be saying that Shae has been mollified somewhat with respect to the marriage, so we're back to square one, I guess.I am starting to think Tyrion won't kill Shae at all. Or if he does, it would be a clear case of self-defence or to save Sansa's life, something to make him look like the hero again.There does almost seem to be an unspoken rule in the writers' room that Tyrion can't be allowed to do anything that makes him look unheroic, ever. Whatever happens to Shae, I am assuming at this point that either 1) Tyrion will have nothing to do with it, 2) Shae will be written to look so spiteful and so villainous that Tyrion will look like a saint for putting her down. Option Number Two is looking really unlikely at this stage of the game--although the writing for Shae tends to veer all over the place, so it's hard to predict how things will shake out--so I guess we're back to Option Number One: someone else killing or otherwise disposing of Shae.

1156	The Mighty Conch	2013-05-20	I think that show Shae is a 100% different person that book Shae.   Show Shae and Tyrion are clearly in love, she is acting jealous and demanding, and Tyrion is reinforcing it, having conversations with her where he apologizes about Sansa, promises Shae he "only has eyes for her" and only thinks of Sansa as pretty from a purely aesthetic standpoint, etc.They are both acting as if they have a "real" relationship.  So, I interpreted Shae as genuinely jealous of their wedding and genuinely relieved that he didn't bed Sansa.This.It is pretty hard to discuss Shae without mentioning Tyrion and how he acts. Maybe I should have named this thread: Shae & Tyrion's "Relationship"You're definitely not the only one who smells something rotten in Denmark with Shae. I always thought Book!Shae's motivations were wholly straightforward. Show!Shae is a lot more wily, and I haven't trusted her from Day 1 (and didn't she tell Tyrion as much?)I do also see some parallels with Shae and Ros and the whole concept of the ladder. Women who were whores who are using their positions to climb out of said status. That said, I definitely think Shae is letting it go to her head a bit more than some, and I think that, just like Ros, it's going to cause her downfall in the end. Play multiple players, and you'll wind up getting caught, eventually. (...and a nice little tieback to the book plot...)That would be very...deceptive of D&D, as I feel that the normal viewer has no idea that Shae is anything but in love with Tyrion. But I wouldn't know as well as somebody who doesn't know the outcome. Anybody watching with an unsullied that thinks anything to the opposite.And to the "hero" discussion of Tyrion- I think he is easily the most likable Lannister in the show which means in every Kings Landing scene you are rooting for him. He hasn't murdered any babies, tossed a kid from a tower, ordered the destruction of a House, or even been unfaithful to Shae. He isn't Ned 2.0, but Ned has been dead for awhile...
1157	Where Boars Glow	2013-05-20	It is really hard to imagine Tywin and Shae in bed together.  I can imagine this Shae betraying Tyrion at the trial and making a mockery of him, but sleeping with Tywin?  And Tywin sleeping with her?Maybe it won't be Tywin on the show.....maybe it will be Bronn.I think the way the show has set up the relationship with those 2 (Buddy film) it would be even more brutal then Tywin.He finishes his dad.....is running back through the walls......goes to find Bronn to accompany him on his epic escape....and finds only Shea in his bed.

It took no time for her to say something like "she's just a child who doesn't care, while I am a woman who really loves you" or something like that.Now, personally, I'm ok with tyrion being portrayed as almost a saint IF that means that they won't change him killing them both Shae and Tywin. I'm sure many would be more than shocked, "but, he was the ONLY DECENT guy in the show!". I really hope that's what DD are trying to achieve.
1159	Newstar	2013-05-20	Now, personally, I'm ok with tyrion being portrayed as almost a saint IF that means that they won't change him killing them both Shae and Tywin. I'm sure many would be more than shocked, "but, he was the ONLY DECENT guy in the show!". I really hope that's what DD are trying to achieve.Good point. The introduction of the golden chain in 3x07 seemed like a wink and a nod to book readers that the show was going to eventually have Tyrion murdering Shae just as he did in the books, but again, there seems to be an unspoken rule about Tyrion not doing anything unheroic, and TV Shae's characterization hasn't hinted at her being anything other than a smart but politically unsophisticated woman in love, and 3x08 seemed to rule out jealousy/resentment as a reason for Shae to betray Tyrion going forward, so I don't know where that leaves us, exactly.At this point, it seems that if the writers are going to make the TV outcome of Tyrion and Shae's relationship match the books' outcome, they have to write face heel turns for Shae and Tyrion, so that betraying Tyrion and giving false testimony against him at the trial/murdering Shae in a fit of rage don't seem wildly out of character. At the same time, it seems to me that while the writers change the "how" of any given character's arc, the "what" or the outcome is likely going to be the same. Tyrion and Shae's genuinely loving relationship in the show and Shae's kinder, more loving character in the show are likely nothing more than detours to the same end result: Shae betraying Tyrion and being murdered by Tyrion. I guess the problem is that I don't see how they get to that outcome from where they're at now, especially with the writers' refusal to depict Tyrion doing anything unheroic and with Book Shae's kinder character.

The fact that Bronn would do anything for money has been highlighted plenty of times.As for Tyrion killing Shae... I don't know.

Arming the Vale Clans (despite knowing that however innocent he was, his Brother had tried to kill Bran).3. Thinking Mash Heddle's murder was quite funny.4. Poisoning Cersei5. Kidnapping and threatening to Rape Tommen6. Issuing threats about how Sansa would be treated in front of the entire Court when she was being beaten daily as it was (that scene on the show would have gone a long way to explaining why Sansa wouldn't trust him). 7.

This was interestingly mentioned in a scene otherwise devoted to spelling out how sweetly naive Sansa can be (asking Shae if her family will be able to come to her wedding to Loras). It also seemed like a wink and a nod to the viewer that Shae is going to turn on Sansa at some point.

Now she has found that security somewhere else.Book Shae, sure, but TV Shae, who has begged Tyrion to run away with her to Essos--pretty much the opposite of a secure, pampered existence, given that they'd be cut off from Lannister resources--not once, but twice?One way I might see it working out is if Tyrion and Shae are happy and whatnot up until the Purple Wedding. Once Tyrion's arrested and Sansa has disappeared, Shae is either located by Tywin or Cersei and coerced into testifying, or she independently decides that Tyrion is going to die no matter what she does and there's nothing she can do to save him, so she may as well take proactive steps (approaching Cersei with the promise of damning evidence) to avoid getting taken down with him. Still not as mercenary and self-interested as Shae was in the books, but it's in keeping with her characterization as a survivor.

1168	WhatIsDeadMayNeverLive	2013-05-20	Shae doesn't want Tyrion to consumate his marriage because she wants him to keep paying her. Simple as that.
1169	Damar	2013-05-20	'The next whore I find in your bed, I'll hang'.
If Tywin finds out that Tyrion is being faithful to his whore rather than putting a babe in Sansa, there's no doubt he would do it, especially if done after Joffrey dies.
1170	SeventySeven	2013-05-20	I'm surprised at the amount of people who actually believe Shae isn't genuinely in love with Tyrion. It's blatantly and ridiculously sappy, because it's meant to be lurve. I know most relationships on screen can be open to interpretation in their dynamics, but this one is quite simple.
1171	Damar	2013-05-20	1. Breaking Marillion's FingersYou mean the guy who played his harp to prevent anyone from hearing Sansa's pleas for help when Lysa was about to push her out of the Moon Door?
1172	JonCon's Red Beard	2013-05-20	Shae doesn't want Tyrion to consumate his marriage because she wants him to keep paying her. Simple as that.So? Are you saying that married lords don't sleep with whores? Or have mistresses? Surely it must be a few. And considering how terrible and forced this marriage is, it would make all the sense.Tyrion does offer Shae a chance to be his mistress, not only his whore: he offered him a house, protection, even children (in books I think he wants to find her a husband), but Shae refused because that would mean her to leave and be away from him. She also suggested them both leave, twice, and Tyrion refused as well. The true is that Tyrion doesn't want to stop being a Lord, and Shae doesn't want to be Tyrion's second option. Both are being stupid.

1173	Newstar	2013-05-20	Shae doesn't want Tyrion to consumate his marriage because she wants him to keep paying her. Simple as that.There have been several suggestions in the show that Shae has genuine feelings for Tyrion above and beyond wanting to keep him as a paying client: begging Tyrion to escape to Essos with her (twice) even though that would likely result in a big downgrade in living for her, her refusal to barricade herself with Sansa in her room in 2x09 because she needs to say goodbye to someone, and so on.There's been nothing to indicate that Shae is currently manipulating Tyrion into believing that she loves him or that her feelings are not genuine. There have been hints that Shae will sell out Sansa and Tyrion when the chips are down (mostly Sansa, whom she warned not to trust anyone and who sweetly stated that she trusted Shae even though Shae had warned her against it), but that's not the same thing as claiming that she doesn't love Tyrion and never loved Tyrion, which isn't the case in the show. I cannot see the show pulling a "Mwahaha I never loved you, you poor sap," because that isn't in keeping with the way TV Shae has been characterized. It makes her different from Book Shae, but a lot of characters are different from their book selves (Tyrion, for one).

1174	baxter	2013-05-20	I always assumed once Tyrion is in the stockades that Tywin swoops in and basically takes her into his charge and threatens her to betray Tyrion.  I haven't done a re-read though so that's a thought from 3 years ago.
1175	Ororo727 Jon Snow Fangirl	2013-05-20	I've always interpreted Shae as being someone that was maybe hired by Tywin to spy/betray Tyrion from the very beginning (and that's one of the reasons why she's sharing Tywin's bed in the end). I've always interpreted her "love" for Tyrion as just being a role that she is playing and there's no reason to think Show-Shae is any different. She reveals her true colors in the end, and Tyrion kills her for it.I agree with that.  In the books she never hesitated to tell Tyrion that she was whore, he was the only one surprised by her actions.  TV is a bit more sympathetic, however, I still do not trust her. A jealous whore is simply ridiculous to me.
1176	baxter	2013-05-20	Nah, Bronn and Tyrion are going to split up over money and status, like in the books. The fact that Bronn would do anything for money has been highlighted plenty of times.As for Tyrion killing Shae... I don't know. It's easier to send a good character on the dark side than the other way round, I'm not sure they'll miss the opportunity.I mean, Shae basically lies to get Tyrion killed by his trial, so I see no reason that they'll make Tyrion forgive her.  They already showed us the chain a few episodes back.  I think everyone in the audience is going to want to see her go down in flames.   Not to mention the scene between Tywin and Tyrion in the privvy will be amazing just from the dialogue, and when Tyrion kills Tywin everyone will rejoice.
1177	WiDMNDBAMMD	2013-05-20	So this episode we see the Tyrion-Sansa wedding and of course everyone expects Tyrion to consummate the marriage, which he doesn't. Shae is of course upset at Tyrion for getting married and having sex with a "little girl" and not staying faithful to her (I guess).BUT THEN when Shae goes to change the sheets and realizes that Tyrion has not had sex with her she seems proud of him and does not seem to bear any bad will to him. SO HOW IN THE WORLD WILL: 
	Spoiler  Shae betray Tyrion by witnessing against him in the trial and sleeping with Tywin? 
Let me know how you guys think this will play out.I think that this allows for Shae and Tyrion to continue their relationship for the time being. Which I figured it would. Shae knows that Tyrion is not sleeping with Sansa even though his father ordered him to. Tyrion defied his father once again for her(took her to KL and now is not sleeping with Sansa because Shae pointed out "your father does not rule the world" )But down the road it doesn't change anything. If Tyrion is accused of murder he will lose the ability to "protect" Shae which was their original agreement. Shae will be questioned extensively about Sansa's disappearance and Cersei will discover the truth about being Tyrion's whore. She already started to figure it out when they were held up with all the other High Born Ladies in Maegor's holdfast.Cersei will make certain promises to Shae so that she'll testify against Tyrion, Cersei will back out of those promises accusing her of knowing where Sansa Stark is. Shae will turn to Tywin to try and get her "golden chains" that Tyrion gave her back.... do we see where this is heading now?If Shae decides to become a Eddard Stark and die for Tyrion instead of lying it just doesn't make any sense.

1178	mrs_serpounce	2013-05-20	1. Breaking Marillion's Fingers2. Arming the Vale Clans (despite knowing that however innocent he was, his Brother had tried to kill Bran).3. Thinking Mash Heddle's murder was quite funny.4. Poisoning Cersei5. Kidnapping and threatening to Rape Tommen6. Issuing threats about how Sansa would be treated in front of the entire Court when she was being beaten daily as it was (that scene on the show would have gone a long way to explaining why Sansa wouldn't trust him).7. Giving the Antler Men to Joff to play with.8. Letting his Wildlings run riot in KL.9. Slapping Shae10. His women issues11. Dismissing the NW and Alister Thorne.Etc etc.Again, we'll have to agree to disagree on "majorly horrible." Note I said majorly, not just "bad things."The things I will agree are "bad things":Slapping Shae, letting the Clans run riot (Show!Tyrion did that too), breaking Marillon's fingers. Possibly the worst: giving the Antler Men to Joff, if he actually fully understood the ramifications of what that meant.The rest of that, I would call greeeeeey. "Women issues?" Sure, they're there, but that's a psychological makeup issue rather than an outright "bad thing." (We won't get into the morality of whoring, because Show!Tyrion does that frequently.) Tommen was used as a pawn, yes. Did he harm him? No, and he himself even says in the novel that he's not sure he could do it, if it came to that. Arming the Vale clans? Act of war. (Show!Tyrion did that, too, BTW.) Poisoning his sister... depends on what you think of his sister. (Me? Not much.) Dismissing Aliser Thorne... depends on what you think of Thorne. (Me? Not much. Also, another Show!Tyrion move.)Issuing threats? *Thinking* a murder is funny? You call both those "majorly horrible"? (PS: Show!Tyrion also issues threats and finds killing funny.)Like I said, "Singer Stew" is what starts it pushing much further toward the black side of things. There are certain justifications that can be thrown out there, but they're still terrible actions. Up to this point: Yes. bad things. But he hasn't really begun a real descent yet.

1179	mrs_serpounce	2013-05-20	You mean the guy who played his harp to prevent anyone from hearing Sansa's pleas for help when Lysa was about to push her out of the Moon Door?That. Also, Alliser Thorne was SUCH an upstanding guy amirite?
1180	David Selig	2013-05-20	You mean the guy who played his harp to prevent anyone from hearing Sansa's pleas for help when Lysa was about to push her out of the Moon Door?What's this got to do with anything? It's not like Tyrion was punishing Marillion for something he'd do a year later....

1181	wizardface	2013-05-20	There is a lot of time before the trial. Im guessing that season 4 will have some build up to Shae's betrayal.

I hope that might foreshadow Simon Silvertongue or the fact that people in flea bottom die and get put into stew.
1183	Lord Paolo Stark	2013-05-20	Show shae has feelings for Tyrion, but I think she'll betray him because she will feel abandoned after his marriage with Sansa
1184	mbuehner	2013-05-20	What if Shae seduced Tywin to try to convince him to save Tyrions life. Oops!
1185	Head of The Ned	2013-05-20	Shae needs to die already. Too bad we have to put up with another season of her.
1186	franko99	2013-05-20	Eh, I'd buy that if in the runup to the wedding Shae had made one comment implying she was outraged on Sansa's behalf and not merely her own, but she didn't. She was jealous and threatened, but she was unconcerned with Sansa's fate of being an innocent child sold off into marriage except to the extent that she would herself be affected by it. Shae's anger was about her situation and only her situation..somewhat bizarrely, since in 3x02 she was all protective of Sansa's virtue when it came to Littlefinger and whatnot.Her glee over the non-consummation does seem a bit delusional, since Tyrion's decision to refuse to consummate the marriage had absolutely nothing to do with Shae or some desire to remain faithful to her, not to mention that Tyrion's refusal to consummate the marriage risks putting him on Tywin's bad side (which will threaten Tyrion's position and by extension Shae's), something Shae seems smart enough to grasp, but whatever.I had thought before 3x08 that the hook for Shae's betrayal on the show would be jealousy and resentment over the marriage, but 3x08 seems to be saying that Shae has been mollified somewhat with respect to the marriage, so we're back to square one, I guess.There does almost seem to be an unspoken rule in the writers' room that Tyrion can't be allowed to do anything that makes him look unheroic, ever. Whatever happens to Shae, I am assuming at this point that either 1) Tyrion will have nothing to do with it, 2) Shae will be written to look so spiteful and so villainous that Tyrion will look like a saint for putting her down. Option Number Two is looking really unlikely at this stage of the game--although the writing for Shae tends to veer all over the place, so it's hard to predict how things will shake out--so I guess we're back to Option Number One: someone else killing or otherwise disposing of Shae. /agree.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':agree:' />Duh, because she is a survivor, and a survivor does whatever it takes to survive, whatever it takes. One of the first things she told Sansa was not to trust anybody life is easier that way.If that's so, she wouldn't have gone to Tywins bed, going to Pentos as she said several times in TV would have been a lot smarter (even if that means going back to be a common whore)ETA: Book Shae, sure, but TV Shae, who has begged Tyrion to run away with her to Essos--pretty much the opposite of a secure, pampered existence, given that they'd be cut off from Lannister resources--not once, but twice?One way I might see it working out is if Tyrion and Shae are happy and whatnot up until the Purple Wedding. Once Tyrion's arrested and Sansa has disappeared, Shae is either located by Tywin or Cersei and coerced into testifying, or she independently decides that Tyrion is going to die no matter what she does and there's nothing she can do to save him, so she may as well take proactive steps (approaching Cersei with the promise of damning evidence) to avoid getting taken down with him. Still not as mercenary and self-interested as Shae was in the books, but it's in keeping with her characterization as a survivor.Yeah that may work, I guess

1187	Where Boars Glow	2013-05-20	Did you notice that Gendry made a reference to flea bottom's "bowl of brown" ? Saying they knew the meat wasn't chicken? I hope that might foreshadow Simon Silvertongue or the fact that people in flea bottom die and get put into stew.I took this more as "Bowls of brown" are made up of whatever is around...cat, rat, dog ect ect
1188	go joff go	2013-05-20	I think they are going to set the murders (and yes tyrion will do it-they introduced the weapon for goodness sakes) up to be more tragic.  That Shae is somehow caught in a web she can't get out of and damned either way.  The show has already implied that Shae is working for someone in the Blackwater episode when she said that she had to meet someone.  Who that person is we don't know but it almost certainly wasn't tyrion.  I don't know how but they will give her a justifiable reason for testifying only Tyrion won't know.  Also I love the theory I saw that Tywin and and Shae were drugged by Varys to set them "sleeping together".  If that went down on the show it would be awesome
1189	jarl the climber	2013-05-20	HBO Shae is different person though. I was expecting the show to make it obvious Tywin is forcing her to talk at the trial and for Tywin to end up killing her...until Tyrion got her that gold chain.I'm curious, did she actually except this gift? He also offered her a mansion with servants, guards, etc. and he has not delivered on any of that either at least not yet. Another problem I have with her being a gold digger is that she has stated that she would have no problem going to Essos with Tyrion even if that cost him all his wealth and power. I would have more of a problem with Tyrion killing her in the show. Also I really think she would kick his ass if he tried to kill her, I just can't see him taking her.
1190	Arjuous	2013-05-20	Lots of fine points have been made in this thread, I'd like to add just a few more.
1) Re: Tyrion the Permanent Hero - While annoying and (at least to book readers) downright blasphemous at times, I can certainly see them setting up Tyrion's anti-hero arch in Essos.  He's always been flawed, but as many have pointed out many of those flaws have been whitewashed.  That does not prevent his eventual descent into a drunken exile, however, and for tv purposes may serve to enhance it, as the disparity will be that much greater.  I prefer the nuances of the book, but I think we still may get the darker side to the Tyrion/Shae ending, if only because it is so vital to setting up his depressed arch in Essos.
2) Re: TV Shae - In anticipation of the deluge of negative comments this might attract, let me preface this by saying this is only criticism of the story we are being entertained by, and my opinions on Shae the character shouldn't be read to reveal any moral declarations.  Obviously, for anyone (whether character or actual person) to be stuck in such an economic and sociopolitical sand trap that their only viable escape is to sell themselves, is a tragic and depressing set of circumstances - one cannot help but wish these realities were different.  Obviously, in a perfect world, we should not have to accommodate the moral-relativism I'm about to embark upon.  But obviously, this is fiction, fantasy at that, and as such we should be allowed to dive into the world and discuss it freely.  
Lengthy disclaimer aside, Seven Hells do I hate TV Shae.  In the most shallow sense, Shae is poorly acted.  It was pointed out on the podcast recently, but it's not her accent, it's her actual performance.  However, the far more unfortunate part is that TV Shae is poorly written, and is a severely diminished character as compared to the books.  While we never get a POV chapter from her, she at the very least plays the cards she is dealt rather well.  She offers Tyrion an escape from all his doubts, and in return she is provided for.  Tyrion is dealing with ingratitude and deception at every turn, yet she is constantly there for him.  She is what he Needs.  She's as close to a fantasy as he could get.  Whether genuine or not, Tyrion wants to believe its real so badly that he falls in love with her, which makes her betrayal all the more painful.  
More importantly, I feel, Book Shae has at least a basic understanding and respect for her position in all of this, which TV Shae completely lacks.  Case in point, whereas Book Shae reacts with support when she learns of the marriage, TV Shae is outraged.  Anyone alive in that world, at that time, would know for a certainty that a whore, or even a hand-maiden, could never marry a Lord, let alone a Lannister.  Yet here TV Shae is, making Tyrion's life even more miserable by petitioning him for something everyone in the Seven Kingdoms knows cannot happen.  What's more, should she be discovered, she would - without question - be executed by Tywin.  While in the real world her position is far from enviable, given the realities of the world she lives in and her situation preceding her relationship with Tyrion, Tyrion has actually given her a pretty good life in the spectrum of things.  She is taken care of economically, and because of this she no longer has to whore herself out for money, which I assume everyone admits is a better situation than she was in befor meeting Tyrion. (note: in the books, she is obviously still Tyrion's whore, and even proudly refers to herself as such, however the TV show has deliberately turned her into Tyrion's girlfriend, so the TV version cannot argue that she is still paid for sex.  Their relationship has been painted as a love story, and more importantly she has abandoned the pretense of being a whore, unless she is attempting to guilt-trip Tyrion, in which case that statement is only done to prod him to say the contrary; that she's not a whore.). 
In the show, she appreciates none of this.  She spends nearly every scene bemoaning her situation and chastising Tyrion for realities outside of his control.  She also seems to have no appreciation for peril she would be in should she be discovered, and on a few occasions she has risked discovery out of spite.  As many have pointed out before, I don't know why either of them like each other in the show.  In the books, she was his escape, his fantasy; she was almost Tysha reborn.  In the show... Well...  I just don't understand.  
It seems they tried to bolt on a real love story to a situation that was a dozen times more complex, and insodoing robbed the original story of its impact.
1191	stiff_pirates	2013-05-20	Shae will be offered a marriage to a landed knight, it's way more to be Tyrion's mistressshe would be a noble, Tyrion couldn't do it for her even with all Casterly Rock's goldimagine if it was Bronn, since Lollys hasnt been in the show. /eek.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':eek:' />
1192	PetyrPunkinhead	2013-05-20	Am I the only one who thinks that Shae is already sleeping with Tywin?  Thus her 'jealousy' is her trying to push Tyrion away so he won't be so upset whenever he finds out?Shut.Your.Mouth.That is reading a lot in to it. A whole lot. In the books Shae wasn't really given much choice. She made the best of a bad situation. She's a survivor. Well, until the end there.  I'm looking forward to Tyrions revenge in the Tower of the Hand more than Joff's wedding really.
1193	Prince of Dragonstone	2013-05-20	The REAL question is...how will the TV audience take Tyrion strangling Shae to death and then putting an arrow through his father's bowels, presumably all in the same episode? Tyrion is D&D and the audience's golden boy. I wonder what people's opinions will be of him. Will they cheer him on? (most likely) or will they turn against him? I feel like it's important to Tyrion's character that he has this ambiguity. He is very much a person to root for, but he also has done some rotten things. Shae and Tywin did him wrong but Tyrion murdering them was unnecessary, IMO.

It will be a bold step imo, but one the producers have to include lest they go off in a completely different direction from the source material.

Thus her 'jealousy' is her trying to push Tyrion away so he won't be so upset whenever he finds out?I'm with you on this.I think Shae was checking on the sheets and reporting back to Tywin.  Tywin is too smart and too observant to have not picked up on her being one of Tyrion's whores.

Finding a whore in his bed would have been believable and would have showed the hypocrisy. Finding Tyrion's whore in his bed was so far over the top it wasn't believable to me.

1208	Versiroth	2013-05-21	Book Shae didn't care if Tyrion was getting married or not.  She just wanted him to keep providing for her.  So, when given the chance to switch to Tywin after Tyrion was imprisoned, she took it easily and had no problems betraying him.  
With that said, for the show, they seem to be making Shae a little different.  She seems to actually love Tyrion.   And if that's the case, it will be interesting to know why she ends up betraying him, sleeping with Tywin.   If they do make it seem like she only does it because her life is threatened, Tyrion killing her will seem a lot more brutal.

No chance would a person like that follow Tyrion. No chance at all.Totally agree with this. As presented thus far in the novels, it doesn't make sense: I hope it'll later be explained as part of a conspiracy. Sure, it's a twist, but having it suddenly revealed that Joffrey has just been pretending to be evil all along because of some misguided way of winning Loras's love would also be a twist. Doesn't make it a good thing.Like others, I'm curious about what Shae's doing with the sheets. In the books isn't it common knowledge that the marriage is never consummated? I didn't read her look to Tyrion as gratified love at all, but rather as smug gloating - but of course that's open to different interpretations. Hence my dilemma with Show!Shae: her character just doesn't make sense to me. I have absolutely no idea what she wants.

I don't get the impression that she loves him any more than I did from the books really. From the show I think its clear that Tyrion loves Shae but it's never truly reciprocated.
1212	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-21	All I know is they should have gotten a better actress than Sibel Kekilli .I think she's fine for the character, she's won awards for acting, so it's not like she can be that bad. Jaquen was from Lorath too, and had a German accent. Well, the actors are both German anyway and the characters are from lorath, so nice touch.
1213	ChromeWeasel	2013-05-21	So? Are you saying that married lords don't sleep with whores? Or have mistresses? Surely it must be a few. And considering how terrible and forced this marriage is, it would make all the sense.Tyrion does offer Shae a chance to be his mistress, not only his whore: he offered him a house, protection, even children (in books I think he wants to find her a husband), but Shae refused because that would mean her to leave and be away from him. She also suggested them both leave, twice, and Tyrion refused as well. The true is that Tyrion doesn't want to stop being a Lord, and Shae doesn't want to be Tyrion's second option. Both are being stupid.Good point.
1214	JonCon's Red Beard	2013-05-21	I don't get the impression that she loves him any more than I did from the books really. From the show I think its clear that Tyrion loves Shae but it's never truly reciprocated.Then why asking him twice to leave and go to the Free Cities? Unless Shae is naive enough to think that he would take all of his family money with him, it's going to be a hard life for them there. Tyrion had a point, he wouldn't get a real job out of Westeros because he's what he is due to his family name and influence. If she's just there for the money, why risk the fact that she can provide her with money by suggesting them to abandon his position and his family, the only reason he has money in first place?
1215	ChromeWeasel	2013-05-21	1. Breaking Marillion's Fingers2. Arming the Vale Clans (despite knowing that however innocent he was, his Brother had tried to kill Bran).3. Thinking Mash Heddle's murder was quite funny.4. Poisoning Cersei5. Kidnapping and threatening to Rape Tommen6. Issuing threats about how Sansa would be treated in front of the entire Court when she was being beaten daily as it was (that scene on the show would have gone a long way to explaining why Sansa wouldn't trust him).7. Giving the Antler Men to Joff to play with.8. Letting his Wildlings run riot in KL.9. Slapping Shae10. His women issues11. Dismissing the NW and Alister Thorne.Etc etc.Was this supposed to be a list of the worst things that Tyrion has done? Because it's not a very damning list.1) Marillion got his fingers broken by the mountain clans according to the wiki.2) Arming the Vale clans was actually a brilliant act by Tyrion. It brought them into the war under his command, and it helped to keep the Vale occupied rather than side with his enemies.3) Thinking something is funny is not the kind of behavior I'll hold against someone. People think violent thoughts all the time. The only ones I care about are those that act on them.4) Tyrion drugged Cersei to keep her out of the small council. Calling this a poisoning suggests that Tyrion tried to murder her. Are you talking about this scene, or something else?5) Tommen wasn't kidnapped by anyone's definition other than Cersei's. Children get betrothed as part of normal family business. Tyrion doesn't bear any ill will to Tommen and remarks about what a good boy he is. His threats to him are also hollow, made in hopes of sparing an innocent whore from being tortured by Cersei.6) Tyrion spared Sansa from Joffrey's and Cersei's abuse, at the cost of his own safety. You're suggesting that his treatment of her was grievous? It seems to largely be the opposite, at great person risk to himself. 7) I don't recall the Antler Men, someone would have to explain this.8) This is typical warfare. Not something to be admired, but also not something to hold over Tyrion specifically. I believe that Barriston remarks about how there is a beast in every man, and the atrocities that he's seen in war.9) I'd like to read the scenes where Tyrion strikes Shae again. I don't remember what provoked that, or if Tyrion was just abusive.10) What women issues? The reality that he is an ugly dwarf that people look down upon? Tyrion has a lot of baggage to deal with in that sense. I don't hold 'women issues' against anyone until that person starts abusing women. And Tyrion doesn't strike me as an abuser of women in particular. He's an all-around jerk and bully to everyone. He insults people regularly unless he takes a liking to someone that's already being bullied. And then he bullies the bully. Most people find that part of Tyrion endearing.11) Dismissing the Night's Watch is a bit harsh. He did talk to his father about helping them. Tyrion put some effort into getting them resources, donated some cash personally, and made more of an argument in their behalf than anyone else does in the whole story. The only other people I recall helping out the Watch at all are Ned Stark and Stannis. And Ned does no more for the watch than Tyrion.Overall, that's a pretty sad list of things that make Tyrion a villain. I will readily admit that Tyrion is a jerk and a bully. But he is a likable character who tends to be on the right side of things. He's had some debatable scenes, like when he killed Tywin and choked Shae to death. I hold more contempt of Tyrion for shooting Tywin than for anything else. Everything that was listed above adds up to morally ambiguous at best.
1216	ImpBeyondTheWall	2013-05-21	Book Shae had no real problem betraying Tyrion even though he never consummated the marriage, so I don't see any reason HBO Shae would either.True
1217	'96Buck	2013-05-21	Was this supposed to be a list of the worst things that Tyrion has done? Because it's not a very damning list.1) Marillion got his fingers broken by the mountain clans according to the wiki.2) Arming the Vale clans was actually a brilliant act by Tyrion. It brought them into the war under his command, and it helped to keep the Vale occupied rather than side with his enemies.3) Thinking something is funny is not the kind of behavior I'll hold against someone. People think violent thoughts all the time. The only ones I care about are those that act on them.4) Tyrion drugged Cersei to keep her out of the small council.

The Antler Men were the KLers, mainly merchants IIRC, conspiring against (or at least speaking against) Joff (antlers/ stags/ supporting true Baretheons).  As Hand, "letting" the king deal with traitors as he will is his duty.  Should he betray the King to defend traitors?  So many oaths....
1218	Woman of War	2013-05-21	I agree with you, ChomeWeasel
And even if I did not agree with any single point it would be totally unimportant to go into detail since no poster who likes the character Tyrion has ever called him flawless, his complexity is what makes him interesting.
And  all those attempts to "blackwash" Tyrion are therefore totally pointless and not more that old news that won't suddenly turn the character boring due to newlyfound wisdom. Sigh.

1220	ChromeWeasel	2013-05-21	The wiki is wrong.Could you remind me what actually happened? I don't recall the situation. All I do remember is that Marillion was a charming low-life ladies-man type. He made it to Lysa's and then scored with all the maids, and attempted to sexually assault Sansa. Whatever Tyrion did would have come first, but I don't have a good opinion of Marillion to go from.
1221	The Mighty Conch	2013-05-21	I think you guys should remember that book!Tyrion is not the same as show!Tyrion, and his transgressions in the book (if they weren't in the show) shouldn't be counted when answering a question pertaining to what will or has happened in the show.11) Dismissing the Night's Watch is a bit harsh.

Ned ends up dead, Tyrion ends up exiled. Both had character flaws that made them interesting, sympathetic, and frustrating characters all at the same time.Ned's honor got him killed in the same way that Tyrion's did. If Tyrion was a total dirtbag he could easily have gone along with all his family's schemes, sucked up to Joffrey, bedded Sansa, and lived happily ever after as a spoiled dirtbag. Tyrion has enough honor to stop some of the crueler treachery around him at the cost of his own inheritance. Of course, a lot of that is also wrapped up in Tyrion's self-loathing and self-pity. If he had less of those things he'd better be able to navigate politics. But that's the stuff that makes him more interesting as well. I can empathize a lot more with Tyrion's self-pity than I can with Cersei's, for example. Yet both character end up in a nest of trouble that's largely of their own making.

1231	HouseHarrison	2013-05-21	I don't get the impression that she loves him any more than I did from the books really. From the show I think its clear that Tyrion loves Shae but it's never truly reciprocated.Honestly I think it's pretty clear she's at least a little in love with him in the show. She certainly is jealous of other women, which book Shae wouldn't have been beyond being threatened that they would take her place (which Shae is smart enough to know would never have been the case with Sansa)Or it's simply show-Shae is better at hiding her true intents and is better at manipulating Tyrion, and this whole thing is just an act. I would like that twist, it would make Tyrion's fall later on all the more tragic.In any regard, the show writers have most of next season to build up the betrayal. So still plenty of time....
1232	Versiroth	2013-05-21	Yeah, theyve played up the love story in this show, so that's probably the angle they'll take, which will just seem sooo contrived.Or they're trying to make their relationship seem sincere before shocking the unsullied with her testifying, bedding Tywin and then being murdered by Tyrion.  If she was the same brainless girl in the books that obviously only wanted the lifestyle, then those things mentioned would be expected.This way, they use the character to add some more drama in.  When Tyrion is on trial, his beloved Shae will be the last person the unsullied expect to testify against him.

There are no subtle signs with TV Shae, which is why I've never understood why they turned her into to a super nice character.PS...Book Shae wasn't brainless since she had Tyrion Lannister wrapped around her little finger, believing she cared about him when she never did.

When Tyrion finds Shae in Tywin's bed, they could go with any number of reasons for Shae to try to explain to Tyrion why she did what she did.   Whether it be because she was threatened or because she felt that Tyrion only ever saw her as a Whore.  Whatever the reason is, explaining it after will work just as good or better than them shoving it in your face to foreshadow it.Honestly, to me, it will be more interesting to see how they work in the fact that Tyrion murders her.

If they make Shae another 'irrational' woman so she can be jealous and then betray Tyrion I will think that is cliche and contrived that they boil the character down to 'jealous bitch' cliche, i will not like that at all. especially as they have made her more complex in the show.Yes it is irrational to be jealous, but aren't we all from time to time? It is human, it the material tragedies are made of. And can't complex people have their irrational moments, reacting dark and revengeful instead of "separation in mutual agreement"Don't get me wrong, it is immoral to foreswear in a situation like this and to add that bit of nastiness "giant of Lannister" but I could explain though not condone it in a situation where Shae was really in love with Tyrion and feels dumped. While in a mere business relationship the idea of "what do you want she is whore" is a highly discriminatory approach, as if a prostitute would be a somewhat morally lesser being. Sex workers are not more entitled to perjury than any citizen. There are hairdressers who have to lie to their clients from time to time, psychologists or doctors, to name some jobs with close client contact.  And yet they have no right to perjury at the expense of their clients only because they might lie to them  during their worktime.So I could better understand  HBO Shae's revenge trip if she is more emotionally involved with Tyrion than book Shae lying so cruelly in court.

Poor Doreah was ordered specifically to seduce Xaro Xhoan Daxos, and we don't even know if and how she betrayed Danerys. She was thrown into an empty cage to starve to death.If HBO can have the very sympathetic Dany do that, then Tyrion can strangle the two-timing whore that plots against him, condemns him to death in trial, and sleeps with his father while he rots in jail.I really don't see how anyone's going to have an issue with Tyrion killing Shae. The only issue is making the actual betrayal realistic.

I don't remember what provoked that, or if Tyrion was just abusive.10) What women issues? The reality that he is an ugly dwarf that people look down upon? Tyrion has a lot of baggage to deal with in that sense. I don't hold 'women issues' against anyone until that person starts abusing women. And Tyrion doesn't strike me as an abuser of women in particular. He's an all-around jerk and bully to everyone. He insults people regularly unless he takes a liking to someone that's already being bullied. And then he bullies the bully. Most people find that part of Tyrion endearing.11) Dismissing the Night's Watch is a bit harsh. He did talk to his father about helping them. Tyrion put some effort into getting them resources, donated some cash personally, and made more of an argument in their behalf than anyone else does in the whole story. The only other people I recall helping out the Watch at all are Ned Stark and Stannis. And Ned does no more for the watch than Tyrion.Overall, that's a pretty sad list of things that make Tyrion a villain. I will readily admit that Tyrion is a jerk and a bully. But he is a likable character who tends to be on the right side of things. He's had some debatable scenes, like when he killed Tywin and choked Shae to death. I hold more contempt of Tyrion for shooting Tywin than for anything else. Everything that was listed above adds up to morally ambiguous at best.I think most of the readers thinks that Tyrion is evil from the first book impression, where Catelyn starts it.Basically, when we could call Ned as Lawful Good and  Tyrion is Chaotic Good (at least till his escape, yet the deed was clearly manipulated by Varys).Excluding breaking singer's fingers, everything he does is usually for greater good, but he is not afraid to break the law (as Ned).Also almost everything backfires"Joffrey is so good, but the evil hand is making all the misery".For example Antler man.They were traitors and they would die. Yet by giving them to Joffrey he had him occupied (not allowing for stupid orders) and giving morale to people. Cersei in the end recall Jofrey which almost ends the siege, and Tyrion goes out to boost morale.11. Night watch and Tyrion.He did everything he could for them at this point, given his power.He ridiculed him in front of the court, because it was the only way he could help them given circumstances (war and everybody else thinks it is fairy tells).You can easily say that excluding the north he was the most active player in the watch business
1252	ugashep	2013-05-21	So this episode we see the Tyrion-Sansa wedding and of course everyone expects Tyrion to consummate the marriage, which he doesn't. Shae is of course upset at Tyrion for getting married and having sex with a "little girl" and not staying faithful to her (I guess).BUT THEN when Shae goes to change the sheets and realizes that Tyrion has not had sex with her she seems proud of him and does not seem to bear any bad will to him. SO HOW IN THE WORLD WILL: 
	Spoiler  Shae betray Tyrion by witnessing against him in the trial and sleeping with Tywin? 
Let me know how you guys think this will play out. Shae is actually a faceless man who used to be Syrio Forel, she did not die, she will reemerge in the next book when she learns that she is a secret Targaryen.
1253	JonCon's Red Beard	2013-05-21	We don't know what's on bookShae's mind, to be honest. Just because she didn't love Tyrion in the same way he loved her doesn't mean she went' straight to Cersei and told her "Yes, I was Tyrion's whore, I'll testify against him if you give me gold". If she never actually cared about Tyrion, she probably only wanted to get out of there before Tywin or Cersei found her and kill her (didn't she knew that they didn't want Tyrion to keep her there?) and take her money and gifts with her. Yet, when they did find her (they knew Tyrion had one and probably more whores), the made her speak against him. Again, not loving someone doesn't make you a bad person, and it was her job to make Tyrion believe she loved him, she's not a sympathetic character but she's not a villain either.
showShae does seem to care for Tyrion, unless she's that much a good actress and manipulative. Why would she ask Tyrion to leave Westeros if all of his money (and consequently, her money) came from Tyrion's father and name? She just said it to pretend she cares knowing that he would say no? She's not THAT smart and even if she is, that would risk her incomes in case he says yes and she's never going to find another patron like him. So, Shae in the show is less a neutral character and she honestly loves Tyrion. Her problem is that she's growing resentful (rather than jealous) because of their doomed romance. He's never going to marry her nor be her husband, and she seemed to not understand that Tyrion can't say no to his father because without him, his name and money, Tyrion can't survive by himself. Maybe she deluded herself into thinking that because Tyrion was a dwarf and an outcast, he would never marry a noble woman so he would choose her instead: if she did, she had a point until Tywin ordered his son to marry Sansa, who was more a prisoner with only a name but not power by herself. I don't see Shae becoming "jealous", but betrayed, thinking that Tyrion didn't fight enough for her, even when he had no position to do it. He did defend her and protect her and in both book and show he tried to help her even after he got married, find her a husband in the book, and a house in the show. Shae said not because she felt she was nothing but his whore and the reality is that while they lived in Westeros and under Tywin's rules, she couldn't be more than that.
1254	Blushingfae	2013-05-22	I've always interpreted Shae as being someone that was maybe hired by Tywin to spy/betray Tyrion from the very beginning (and that's one of the reasons why she's sharing Tywin's bed in the end). I've always interpreted her "love" for Tyrion as just being a role that she is playing and there's no reason to think Show-Shae is any different. She reveals her true colors in the end, and Tyrion kills her for it.I've always interpreted Shae as being someone that was maybe hired by Tywin to spy/betray Tyrion from the very beginning (and that's one of the reasons why she's sharing Tywin's bed in the end).

She reveals her true colors in the end, and Tyrion kills her for it.I totally agree. We saw her meet with Varys a while back, and there is one glaring thing that has always bothered me about Tywin, he insists Tyrion does not bring his whore to Kings Landing. Every parent knows the one way to get your stubborn kid to do something is to tell him NO.
1255	WiDMNDBAMMD	2013-05-22	imagine if it was Bronn, since Lollys hasnt been in the show. /eek.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':eek:' />Shae is not marriageable material. Bronn points this out last episode. Also Bronn is offered a wife that gives him a chance at having a son that would be a lord of a small castle. Meaning he could become a lord protector if things work out correct for him. Which they do because Cersei is a moron.Yeah, they're gonna play the psycho jealous bitch card with her, aren't they /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />I guess they already had the Ros trying to play her cards to move up in the world and we see how that turned out.I don't know how it's going to play out, I mean if she still tries to be jealous after Tyrion doesn't sleep with Sansa then I think people will want her to die.I'll be mad if that's her reason for a betrayal...I liked it much more when she loved Tyrion and cared for Sansa, and was against the marriage mostly for Sansa's well being, but recognising that Tyrion can't do much.Trying to have Shae/Tyrion love deal is just stupid. Tyrion is suppose to be a smart man. He knows that he cannot keep Shae a secret in KL forever. His father will kill her when she is discovered or worse give her to all his soldiers and parade her naked through the streets. Tyrion's idea in the book of finding her a hedge knight for her to marry or something and live in the city happily ever after was a good idea.but with Shae being genuinely in love with Tyrion for who he is just makes it impossible for him to give her a happy ending.Danerys killed Doreah for less, and did so in a more gruesome way. Poor Doreah was ordered specifically to seduce Xaro Xhoan Daxos, and we don't even know if and how she betrayed Danerys. She was thrown into an empty cage to starve to death.There was a horrible deleted scene with Doreah being the one that steals Dany's dragons and kills her handmaiden Irri. IDK if a deleted scene counts as canon or not. If they kept it in then everyone would be happy that Doreah got put in that vault, instead of confused.but the "monologue" is horrible, just simply horrible.here's the linkIf HBO can have the very sympathetic Dany do that, then Tyrion can strangle the two-timing whore that plots against him, condemns him to death in trial, and sleeps with his father while he rots in jail.I really don't see how anyone's going to have an issue with Tyrion killing Shae. The only issue is making the actual betrayal realistic.It makes the betrayal less realistic. Shae doesn't care about gold or money or anyone else, she wants to sail off to Pentos with Tyrion. When she did care about money, gold, jewels and getting a handsome knight for a husband with a keep for herself in the city, the betrayal makes more sense.Now I seem to think that somehow Varys will hide Shae from Cersei and Shae will go with Tyrion to Pentos like she has wanted to do for the last two seasons. Also I expect Bronn to possibly go as well. Let's just keep the whole group together why don't we?In the books I didn't think that Shae actually betrayed Tyrion. She lied about their relationship and her background, but Tyrion was doomed when she testified against him, it was just Cersei twisting the knife. After Cersei doesn't give her the things she promised Shae, she turns to someone or something else which makes her then ends up in Tywin's bed naked.Bronn's betrayal is a bit more harsh because Bronn actually has a chance to save Tyrion's life, all be it a pretty mountainous task for a reward that is less than what Cersei offers him.I think it's hugely important that Bronn doesn't fight for Tyrion. It shows that there's a limit to what a sellsword will do for the person that they're in service to and that there's a reason there's no old bold sellswords.I think there's a lot more grey things that Dany is starting to do that people are starting to think that she's getting too arrogant.My unsullied brother believes that Dany is going to "not win" because she's getting too corrupted by power.We don't know what's on bookShae's mind, to be honest. Just because she didn't love Tyrion in the same way he loved her doesn't mean she went' straight to Cersei and told her "Yes, I was Tyrion's whore, I'll testify against him if you give me gold".Shae was detained because she was Sansa's handmaiden and Cersei believed that she knew where Sansa Stark had disappeared to. Basically all I'm trying to say is, the queen came to her, questioning her, so she found out the truth. How easily Shae ratted her out would probably change how some people feel about her, if she holds out for awhile compared to folding quickly. We know from Cersei's POV that Cersei made "certain promises" which she didn't really care about keeping to a whore and Shae was depending on some of those things to get out of the situation in decent shape with her life.The trial does start a few days after the PW and Shae's testimony is on the last day of the three or four day trial, so it does take less than a week for Shae to turn on Tyrion.  If she never actually cared about Tyrion, she probably only wanted to get out of there before Tywin or Cersei found her and killed her (didn't she know that they didn't want Tyrion to keep her there?) and take her money and gifts with her. Yet, when they did find her (they knew Tyrion had one and probably more whores), the made her speak against him. Again, not loving someone doesn't make you a bad person, and it was her job to make Tyrion believe she loved him, she's not a sympathetic character but she's not a villain either. /agree.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':agree:' />showShae does seem to care for Tyrion, unless she's that much a good actress and manipulative. Why would she ask Tyrion to leave Westeros if all of his money (and consequently, her money) came from Tyrion's father and name? She just said it to pretend she cares knowing that he would say no? She's not THAT smart and even if she is, that would risk her incomes in case he says yes and she's never going to find another patron like him.That's the funny thing isn't it? Shae can find work anywhere, though if she keeps her agreement with Tyrion to "not take another man into her bed" then how does she work as a whore? She can't. Tyrion would not be able to find a job across the narrow sea either. His money, power, influence come from his name. The only thing he has to offer once you take his name away is his "knowledge and wisdom".So, Shae in the show is less a neutral character and she honestly loves Tyrion. Her problem is that she's growing resentful (rather than jealous) because of their doomed romance. He's never going to marry her nor be her husband,Is it somehow possible that she believes he is going to love her, since the only woman that he ever loved was a whore that was payed to love him? I mean this act that she's pulling of trying to be in love with him, etc. is exhausting but is it all an act? From what I remember Tyrion cannot get a read on her. He doesn't even know where she's from.and she seemed to not understand that Tyrion can't say no to his father because without him, his name and money, Tyrion can't survive by himself. Maybe she deluded herself into thinking that because Tyrion was a dwarf and an outcast, he would never marry a noble woman so he would choose her instead: if she did, she had a point until Tywin ordered his son to marry Sansa, who was more a prisoner with only a name but not power by herself.I think the only thing that she might possibly know is that Tyrion doesn't have self confidence with girls because he's a dwarf and the only woman that ever loved him he believes is a whore who was payed to love him.Tyrion points out that Sansa is going to have many suitors because of her name alone, the fact that she's a beautiful young girl just is icing on the cake.The same fact cannot be said for Tyrion though, even though by rights he should be heir to Castley Rock since Jaime is Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. Even Margaery Tyrell points this out. My question is why is no one else tried to offer one of their daughters for Castley Rock?I don't see Shae becoming "jealous", but betrayed, thinking that Tyrion didn't fight enough for her, even when he had no position to do it. He did defend her and protect her and in both book and show he tried to help her even after he got married, find her a husband in the book, and a house in the show. Shae said not because she felt she was nothing but his whore and the reality is that while they lived in Westeros and under Tywin's rules, she couldn't be more than that.but I don't understand her position. It just doesn't make sense to me. She wants to leave Westeros, why doesn't she? She's in love with a man that she can never marry, she doesn't want to have children with either. Are we going to assume that Tyrion is a better lover than Podrick? Is that the answer we have to go with? Shae has to realize that there's no future that ends well for her. Does Shae just not believe she can find someone out there that will be as happy with her as Tyrion is?That is possible. Tyrion is one of the few people that will love a whore for who she is, because he doesn't believe that there's any woman that could love him for who he is.  Shae is trying to be that girl for him. Someone that doesn't care if he's rich or a juggler but it seems a little bit unrealistic if Shae truly is in love with Tyrion. Not because Tyrion's a dwarf but because Shae is "da funny whore"

Bronn is rewarded for his actions, Shae is killed.It's pretty funny that the readers generally react in a similar manner to Westeros society: At best, Bronn is considering a badass for "betraying" his "friend" to better his situation, at worst, people are indifferent. Shae on the other hand is a dirty cocksucking whore who deserved to die for doing the exact same thing.I'm willing to bet my Nimbus 2000 that the show is going to play up the Crazy Jealous Scorned Woman trope with Shae and make Tyrion's murder look completely justified. The scene will be scripted/shot in a way that will make the audience feel sorry for Tyrion for falling for such a despicable whore.

Bronn likes Tyrion but does not owe him any loyalty, nor has he said he is loyal to Tyrion. How can it be a betrayal then?I think my point is that Bronn doing nothing is not betrayal. Just like Shae is not betraying Tryion either. The situation is a bit different but as far as Tyrion's concerned Bronn has a chance to save him, where Shae does not.That is what I meant, from Tyrion's point of view, losing Bronn was his best chance to win his trial.Shae cannot condemn him nor save him. Both have a level of frustration as Tyrion cannot possibly give Bronn a legitimate reason to champion him, besides "promises" of if and when and maybe. After he's arrested he cannot protect Shae either and realizes the error in keeping her around.
1262	Stark Outlook	2013-05-22	i always assumed that book shae was fooling tyrion all along, he wanted her to love him so she played that role and made him happy as a whore in her position should do.  after tyrions fall from grace she took another oppertunity to gain stature with tywin and as she never liked him it was an easy betrayal
it seems theyre trying to give the impression that tv shae actually cares for tyrion but again that may just be for the audience and she could be faking it too. i wouldnt be surprised if they changed her story completely, but if they dont i think it would still work
1263	house of husky	2013-05-22	I agree partialyin the books she ended up in Lord Tywin's bed? why?if it was just a way of surviving, why bedding Lord Tywin?I always wondered about that. Tywin didnt really seem to be up for any rumpy pumpy. I never saw him as having needs other than being controlling and all powerfull
1264	Woman of War	2013-05-22	You are making me say things I really didn't say at all.

She didn't. Or at least not any more than Bronn did. And therein lies the double-standard.Of course Shae did not deserve to be murdered, it was wrong to do so. No one deserves to be murdered or to be executed. But Book Shae did far more than to lie because she was forced: she was spiteful with that bit of giant fo Lannister and she falsely  accused Sansa as well who was a child and for sure would have been executed alongside with Tyrion, Sansa had certainly not wronged Shae. So Shae did for sure far more than someone caught between a rock and a hard place. i like her character as streetwise woman but this was inexcusable.And this cannot be compared to Bronn. He refused to do a dangerous action while Shae actively did the wrong thing. Just as Tyrion was not entitled to murder her she was not entitled to put a nail into Tyrion's coffin.Even if Tyrion had mistreated her, he slapped her ONCE, she was not entitled to be part in murder. " the implication that she owed Tyrion any sort of loyalty...."And there is for sure no right that you can wrong everone to whom you do not owe any sort of loyalty.A working contract of society is precisely based on the rule that even people who do not know each other, who are not friends, who are not part of the same in-society group are yet bound by the same laws and owe each other correct behaviour. A lawful society is created on the fact that you are not entitled to wrong ANYONE. You owe a behaviour according to laws to ANY member of society, not only to those "you owe anything" otherwise society would collapse. If we apply modern morality exactly this counts for Shae concerning Sansa and Tyrion, "no loyalty" is not an excuse for telling damning lies.

Shae was part of the conspiracy that gets Tyrion convicted of murder. Bronn was not.Bronn also never pretended to be in love with Tyrion, and never misled him as to his motives.  Told him to his face that he liked him, but that he couldn't fight the Mountain as Tyrion's champion.  And given what was happening, it really didn't affect Tyrion at all whether Bronn got a lordship or not.  There was no betrayal.Shae actively DID betray Tyrion by lying in court. Bronn did nothing at all to help or hinder the process. That's not even remotely the same thing. You have to have some really bizarre prejudices to think that Shae and Bronn betrayed Tyrion equally.

Lying to facilitate giving an innocent man the death penalty, and an innocent girl as well, is no different morally from murder itself in my book.
1269	sausagekingchi	2013-05-22	Umm, in the books Shae talks to Tyrion about leaving King's Landing as well, but that still didn't stop her from fucking his father.  In the books she absolutely is just using him and trying to manipulate him (my giant of Lannister - c'mon, she's totally playing him and why it was the exact wrong thing to say to Tyrion when he found her in his fathers room - it was absolute proof to him that everything she said/did was bs and it hurt him badly).  Hell, Tyrion keeps reminding himself in the book to not trust her becuase she's just a whore, and the nice things she says are most likely lies.  He's just so desparate to have someone love him he allows himself to buy into her lies.  Shae's a scumbag whore and screws people for money, end of story.  If they don't have her betray him on the show like they did in the books I'll be very disappointed.
1270	The Monkey	2013-05-22	I hate show-Shae so damn much. That actress can't deliver a single line that isn't cringe-worthy. As great as the scene of Tyrion killing Shae was in the book, I really wouldn't mind if she died in the next episode.
1271	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-22	Shae's a scumbag whore and screws people for money, end of story.  I don't think being a whore who screws people for money makes you a scumbag.  It's a way to support yourself without starving. It's what she did after his capture that made her a scumbag.

1277	mediterraneo	2013-05-22	Well, it is well established that Littlefinger is bad, and has whores that bed the important people in Westeros for info (Loras). Also someone pointed out it was difficult for Bronn to find "one like this" in Tywinn's camp kitchens before Tyrion's first battle.
And Ros did it slip that she was not faithful to Littlefinger with just one person of her profession.
Maybe it was a bad idea, to try to protect Sansa.

1278	Lord Joker Of FunLand	2013-05-22	Shae is just like in the books, a prostitute trying to make her way in the world, by being a Lord's whore.
Her jealousy, to me, is her showing she's afraid she'll be cast aside and not have all the gold and clothes she wants. Out of anger/jealousy/fear she'll be a poor whore again, she turns to Cersei with the deal that she'll talk about Tyrion during the trial, for a marriage with a Knight.
Honestly, some of you like to complain just for the sake of complaining.
1279	Lord Joker Of FunLand	2013-05-22	yeh buut how villain? how would they do that now? because up until this point she's been 'the lovable whore'Yes, the lovable whore that will betray the fan favorite character, who everyone will pity.Pretty easy to turn her into a villain.

And that its not like she has done anything big to put her in the good graces of viewers. Protecting Sansa was a while ago...
1281	Sniraga	2013-05-22	The book Shae made a living/survived by telling people what they wanted to hear and acting the way they wanted. Tyrion wanted words of love and admiration, so Shae provided them for him. Cersei wanted her to condemn and maybe ridicule Tyrion in the court, so Shae said what was expected of her. She was a shallow and greedy girl, but she didn't have a chance against the Lannisters either.
The show Shae seems to be entirely different and so are her dynamics with Tyrion. She argues with Tyrion and he lets her to speak her mind and basically treats her like an equal. She seems to genuinely care for him and all the bling-bling and other luxuries are less of an importance to her.
I really can't see how D&D can make the betrayal storyline work without some major adjustments (perhaps they'll have Ramsay to torture Shae for a few episodes in order to squeeze a testimony out of her), but then again, D&D might want both Shae and Tyrion to go a total 180 degree turn with their behaviour for the greater shock impact. But even in that case, there should be some little signs beforehand, and I'm not sure if I've seen any so far.
1282	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-22	Then why would she repeatedly insist on them running away? What do you think she'd do if Tyrion just said ''lol all right then''

1284	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-22	Then why would she repeatedly insist on them running away? What do you think she'd do if Tyrion just said ''lol all right then''I think she's smart enough to know that her time as Tyrion's mistress will end once her looks go, perhaps because she worries that Sansa may come to actually appreciate him.  So, staying in Westeros when he's married to Sansa is not a very good long term option for her. At the same time, she may well think that even if he flees, he can bring a bunch of Lannister gold with him, and/or believe that he is liekly smart enough to make a fortune overseas anyway. IOW, she's doesn't want to flee "the good life" in Westeros just to be with Tyrion the person.  She's willing to flee because she thinks Tyrion will be able to do quite well for himself overseas anyway, AND she'll be able to actually marry him.
1285	Ghost from Winterfell	2013-05-22	6. Issuing threats about how Sansa would be treated in front of the entire Court when she was being beaten daily as it was (that scene on the show would have gone a long way to explaining why Sansa wouldn't trust him).He does that? Can you quote? I'm not doubting you I just don't remember that.

1286	Newstar	2013-05-22	It seems pretty apparent at this point that they're playing up the jealousy angle.I dunno. It seemed like the little smile Shae and Tyrion exchanged at the end of 3x08 resolved the little "Shae is jealous/resentful" subplot. Something else could happen after 3x08, I guess, but once Sansa learns about the RW, she'll be even more alienated from Tyrion, which should ease any jealousy Shae might have left, not exacerbate it. So I'm not convinced that Shae's going to go into a psychotic jealous rage, since it looks like Sansa and Tyrion's marriage on the show will be as strained and miserable as it was in the books. What will Shae have to be jealous about?D&D have no idea how to write female characters and are desperate to make Tyrion come out as a hero so I'd be surprised if this plot line ends up making any sort of sense.Someone mentioned the show's treatment of Doreah upthread (and a mercifully deleted scene where she goes full-out psycho on poor Irri), so the writers aren't above such insta-villainy shenanigans, but I would hope, Shae being a more central character than Doreah, that her actions on the show--whatever they are--would get better writing and that the writers won't just throw up their hands and have her turn from Tyrion's loving, devoted mistress to a vengeful harpy gleefully bent on his destruction.If we sort of estimate based on how TV Tyrion has been written to date, and how TV Shae has been written to date, and if we assume that they will continue to be written more or less the same way in Season 4 without some extreme characterization changes, then I think the only option left is Tywin and/or Cersei forcing Shae to give false testimony against Tyrion on pain of death, Tywin having her killed (hanged, maybe?) once she's served her purpose, Tyrion finding out and murdering Tywin in revenge.

1287	shiola	2013-05-22	Tyrion murdering Tywin as revenge for killing Shae suuuuucks and I'd hate to see it.  It just cheapens so much to me and changes all that was good in Tyrion's ADWD story.  BUT, I acknowledge that TV-only viewers would enjoy it just fine.  I would be very surprised if they end up going any other route, really.  Pleasing book readers has never been the goal with this show, so I think it makes sense for Shae's death via Tywin to be what really fucks Tyrion up.  She can be his Tysha in the show (even though he has already talked about Tysha in the show, which I think is weird to include but whatever).I don't really know my point.  I don't like the idea of Tywin kills Shae--> Tyrion kills Tywin, but I think it makes sense for TV.
1288	Newstar	2013-05-22	I think it makes sense for Shae's death via Tywin to be what really fucks Tyrion up.  She can be his Tysha in the show (even though he has already talked about Tysha in the show, which I think is weird to include but whatever).I imagine that in this scenario, TV Tyrion would be less "Shae never loved me/Tysha loved me/Tysha's the only one who ever loved me/I have to find Tysha" and more "Tysha truly loved me and was victimized by Tywin, and I couldn't do anything to help her/Shae truly loved me and was victimized by Tywin, and I couldn't do anything to help her/I failed both of them, I couldn't protect either of them from Tywin, etc. etc./I have to find Tysha and make amends because I can't do anything for Shae." Or something, I'm just spitballing here. In this scenario, Tysha loses her special status as The Only One Who Loved Tyrion to become The Only One Who Loved Tyrion Whom Tyrion Has a Chance of Helping (or similar). It might work: Tyrion's anguish would be over the similar fates of Tysha and Shae (innocents victimized by Tywin as a result of Tyrion's relationship with them), as opposed to Tysha's unmasking as the only woman who truly loved him, but the end result would be the same. Shae's death will compound the impact on Tyrion of the shattering truth about Tysha truly loving him, since Shae's fate will play like Tysha 2.0 for Tyrion. Tyrion not only losing Shae, but losing her in similar fashion to the way he lost Tysha, for similar reasons (her relationship with Tyrion), would mess him up pretty hardcore. This change might also explain how TV Tyrion, pretty saintly in comparison to his book self, would be pushed to the point of murdering Tywin: not only would he have learned the truth about Tysha, he would also know that Tywin was responsible for having Shae killed.It would be a motivation change for sure, but the show has changed characters' motivations (Robb marrying Talisa for love as opposed to marrying Jeyne to preserve her honour) without changing the end result, and this could fit into that. Tyrion's motivations would be different, but the end result would be the same: Shae's still dead, Tywin's still dead by Tyrion's hand (murdered in a blind rage over what Tywin did to the woman/women who truly loved him), and Tyrion's obsessed with finding Tysha.It would explain a lot about the show's characterization of Shae if they're setting her up to be Saintly Dead Tysha 2.0, come to think of it.I don't really know my point.  I don't like the idea of Tywin kills Shae--> Tyrion kills Tywin, but I think it makes sense for TV.Well, that's it. In this scenario (Tywin murders an innocent Shae, Tyrion murders Tywin), TV viewers would care about Tyrion's grief over the fate of Shae in the show, since the audience has come to see their loving relationship and root for the character of Shae and the couple. Tyrion obsessed with finding Tysha, a character the audience has never met, and having murdered Shae, a woman the audience had seen him in a loving, devoted relationship with for three-odd seasons, on the other hand...The change would also leave Tyrion and Shae's characterization to date on the show intact. And yeah, that means some pretty serious continued whitewashing of both Tyrion and Shae, but we're three seasons in and short of some crazy changes in characterization, I think we're pretty much stuck with whitewashed versions of both characters in the show.

1289	Sniraga	2013-05-23	Newstar, I think you're probably right with your scenario. I was also toying with the idea of Tywin killing Shae and Tyrion killing Tywin for that, but the part with Shae giving a false testimony against Tyrion seemed somewhat problematic to me. I don't see how TV Shae could ridicule Tyrion like her book counterpart, but I also can't see how D&D would skip that kind of opportunity to make the audience feel even more sorry for Tyrion...But perhaps the testimony part isn't as important as making Shae a Tysha 2.0. and re-enacting a tale of star-crossed lovers. After all, this is a TV series and the "show, not tell" -principle demands more romance for Tyrion than just few words about Tysha in S1.
1290	SeventySeven	2013-05-23	I don't mind her as an actress, her performance doesn't scream "bad actress" to me, she's kind of limited and gets WAY too much screen time, but the actress herself doesn't bother me, as compared to you know who and her ass.I think people underestimate how difficult it is to act in a language that isn't your own. You're not as fluent, and words don't sound as charged in a second language so it takes lots of practice and familiarity with the language. I think the actress is doing a decent job overall.It's the characterisation of Shae in the show that's all over the place.
1291	Lord Freypie	2013-05-23	I hope they won't sacrifice Tyrion evolution and greyness too much, and so will find a way to make him kill Shae (should be even stronger if they avoid making Shae a totally bad character).
Now I suspect/fear, if Tysha is to be found in the books (something show authors know) they may have decided to make Shae replace Tysha as the lost love Tyrion will search.
Tywin may force her to testimony then send her to an unknown place for Tyrion to find her some seasons later. In a TV perspective it makes more sense to make Tyrion search a character the viewer has seen and liked than an unknown figure of his past. Tysha may also replace Shae as the dead love (Tywin may tell he hanged Tysha and Tyrion kill him because of that).

(Plus since TV Tyrion is like 35-40 yo, it would be kinda weird if he started looking for an ex-gf after 20-25 years or so.) But I don't think Tywin would let Shae go, maybe she manages to escape on her own? Like the sassy girl she is!

Like the sassy girl she is!Hehe, this is getting quite soap-operaesque /pimp.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':pimp:' />Correct me if I'm wrong with the ages at the beginning of the series, not the book ages.In Blackwater Cersei said that she was four when Tyrion was born and their mother died. So Tyrion is four years younger than Cersei and Jaime.Joffrey is seventeen to eighteen?And Robert and Cersei married after the rebellion. In the books Cersei was sixteen or so when she married.Makes sixteen + nineteen at least = 35Tyrion four years younger means that he is 31 to 32 at the beginnning of the series. The actor is over forty as far as I know but well preserved.In s1 Tyrion said that he was sixteen at the Tysha catastrophe. This is, btw the reason why the showmakers could not make him having "gone last" since he was, at sixteen, a young adult and not an abused child anymore, a different degree  of guilt and a kind of "blackwashing".So there, at the beginning of the series, fifteen to sixteen years would have been passed since the rape and disappearance of Tysha who would, just like Tyrion, be around 32 to 33 by now. This I have counted from Sansa's age, fourteen, since she was thirteen at the beginning of the series. But there must have passed more than one year since then, so maybe Sansa's age was an error and she should rather be fifteen, in line with her looks.This means that Tysha would have been lost for around 16 years. Or am I wrong?Anyways, I would like to know the character, not the actors', ages in the series. Any ideas?

1297	Sniraga	2013-05-23	I'm not sure with the show ages, so when I said TV Tyrion was 35-40, it was purely an estimation. I know the actor is over forty, but the character is clearly somewhat younger. Making him under 35 would seem a bit of strech, imo, so that's where I drew a line. But I'm happy to be corrected if I'm wrong.
I actually didn't remember that TV Tyrion had his encounter with Tysha when he was sixteen, so you should definitely take my musings with a big grain of salt.
So I may be wrong, but I think it was said that Cersei married Robert when she was 19 or 20 (???), and that would make her age something like 38 or 39 at the beginning, right? Being four years younger, Tyrion was perhaps 34 or 35. So Tysha have been lost ~ 20 years by now. My original -25 years estimation seems to be a bit too long.

That would be SO LAME.
1299	Newstar	2013-05-23	Tysha may also replace Shae as the dead love (Tywin may tell he hanged Tysha and Tyrion kill him because of that).It's true that Shae could completely replace Tysha by being the living Tyrion love sent away, with TV Tysha being the dead one. However, there can't be two living "Tyshas," so either Shae dies or Tysha is confirmed to have died. It's not like Tyrion is going to be knocking on brothel doors asking about two lost loves: it's going to be either Tysha or Shae whom he's trying to find.I tend to think the "live" one will be Tysha and the dead one will be Shae, just to erase any doubt in the viewer's mind that Tywin isn't lying about Tysha being dead, just as Tywin forced Jaime to lie to Tyrion about Tysha being a whore. Better to have a "confirmed" kill of Shae rather than Shae escaping along with a story about Tysha's fate from someone who has already deceived Tyrion about Tysha already. It works better, I think.I'm not sure with the show ages, so when I said TV Tyrion was 35-40, it was purely an estimation. I know the actor is over forty, but the character is clearly somewhat younger. Making him under 35 would seem a bit of strech, imo, so that's where I drew a line. But I'm happy to be corrected if I'm wrong.While I wouldn't put too much weight on what the show has said about characters' ages when X, Y, and Z took place and the number of years since X, Y, and Z took place, we do know that 1) Cersei is four years older than Tyrion, and 2) Cersei is according to Tywin "still fertile" (which can't put her any older than 40), so I think 36 is probably the absolute maximum for TV Tyrion's age, until we get confirmation otherwise, and he could well be younger.

1300	JonCon's Red Beard	2013-05-23	7) I don't recall the Antler Men, someone would have to explain this.8) This is typical warfare. Not something to be admired, but also not something to hold over Tyrion specifically. I believe that Barriston remarks about how there is a beast in every man, and the atrocities that he's seen in war.We forget often that the game of thrones not only is a game of power, it's also a game of how we display such power.In book 5, Jon makes the decision to kill a man* by himself after such man rebelled against him. He could have, at the end, simply made an empty threat and sent him to his duties. But he couldn't. Jon had to kill him to show the others he won't allow more disrespects because he's now their leader and to let them know what fate would have those who opposed him and still see him as a child. The kings of the story or the pretenders to the IT do pretty much the same, they can't only win battles, they have to win them by being merciless, something that would either discourage enemies or win loyalists.(*You know who I'm talking about and even when there is "spoilers" on the title... just in case)Bronn's betrayal is a bit more harsh because Bronn actually has a chance to save Tyrion's life, all be it a pretty mountainous task for a reward that is less than what Cersei offers him.Actually, for me, Bronn's situations isn't that bad, although sad because Bronn is a nice chap. I don't remember where the subject of "friendship" was brought (books or show. Or none), but it was always clear in both that Bronn worked for Tyrion and Tyrion paid it. Their scene during "Bear and M. Fair" pretty much implies it: "you pay me to kill your enemies, and the sassyness is free", something like "yes, I like to chat with you, to hang around, but we still have an employer/employee relationship and I won't kill people for you for free". Again, Tyrion saw Bronn as a friend, when at the end, Bronn was nothing but a close employee of him, someone trustable but still, paid by him. When Tyrion asked Bronn to be his champion, Bronn told him he's not his brother, which pretty much means "I won't die for you". That doesn't mean that he wasn't worried, though. He pretty much seemed to be concerned about Tyrions.Is it somehow possible that she believes he is going to love her, since the only woman that he ever loved was a whore that was payed to love him? I mean this act that she's pulling of trying to be in love with him, etc. is exhausting but is it all an act? From what I remember Tyrion cannot get a read on her. He doesn't even know where she's from.Shae wouldn't be the first whore who thought his patron loved her. Actually, there is another example in the books, that young girl who had the misfortune to have sex with Robert Baratheon and have a bastard of his. As Ned pointed out, the girl was in love and was naive enough to think he would return for her. And I'm sure there are way more cases than those two around. I don't think showShae was silly enough to fall in love with the men that hired her, but in this case, she probably realised that there wouldn't be any danger on loving Tyrion: he was never meant to be married to a highborn lady, and he would always have her around to provide him with sex and some tenderness and at some point, they might even leave Westeros and live as husband and wife. But the idea of a real wife, someone who might give him love and care would freak her out as she knew one of the reasons he kept her was that no one else would give him that for free. Shae was replacing the wife he was never meant to have, and yet, his father got her a pretty nice and innocent wife. I would be scared to be sent away too. bookShae is a different scenario: she didn't care about Tyrion, nor his marriage, not even his life. And even if she did care a bit, there was nothing she could do. Testify in his benefit? They would kill her.The same fact cannot be said for Tyrion though, even though by rights he should be heir to Castley Rock since Jaime is Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. Even Margaery Tyrell points this out. My question is why is no one else tried to offer one of their daughters for Castley Rock?Many reasons. One of them, they probably want their "better" daughters for better suitors, and not a dwarf that might not even be capable of produce children or hurt their girls. And offering the Lannisters a second or third daughter would really offend them.but I don't understand her position. It just doesn't make sense to me. She wants to leave Westeros, why doesn't she? She's in love with a man that she can never marry, she doesn't want to have children with either. Are we going to assume that Tyrion is a better lover than Podrick? Is that the answer we have to go with? Shae has to realize that there's no future that ends well for her. Does Shae just not believe she can find someone out there that will be as happy with her as Tyrion is?Well, the only way they could get marry is if they leave Westeros. But we know he doesn't want to because he wouldn't be half (n.p.i. i swear) the important man he is under his father's protection. She probably thinks that they would have the same life they have in KL if they travel to any of the Free Cities and she's wrong: Tywin Lannister would disinherit him as soon as he finds out he married a whore. Or she thinks he could find a job there: wrong again, they both would be taken prisoners, and she would be whoring again while he's sent to entertain some lord.
1301	Woman of War	2013-05-24	Great analysis, gammaerys
1302	ChromeWeasel	2013-05-24	Exactly, I saw the chain as foreshadowing what he would do /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' /> I HOPE Tywin doesn't kill her and Tyrion kills him out of revenge. That would be SO LAME.That would be a pretty important change. GRR Martin has a lot of clout on the show. The real question is whether that's the kind of change that he'd accept. The whole segment of Tyrion lying to Jamie about Joffrey, strangling Shae, and finally shooting Tywin is a very dark period for Tyrion. If you take Tysha out of it, all that's left is anger at Tywin. That doesn't have the same character development. And I expect that Tyrion's lie about Joffrey will play out in the final books. It just seems like a pretty big change for Martin to be ok with.
1303	BurningCandle	2013-05-24	I agree OP, I've long thought that this is a really weird way for them to interpret Shae. In the books we see her as a manipulative, uncaring woman who is clearly using Tyrion for everything she can get, then throws him out like garbage when she is given a better offer.
Tyrion is admittedly paying for her services but he does actually fall in love with her, and she knows it and plays off it, which makes her pretty despicable. The the betrayal of Tyrion knowing it will kill him just makes her moreso.
When he kills her, I feel it is justified though still horrifying because he said he loved her.
With Shae in the show, Tyrion is in the wrong every step of the way. He is taking care of her, but she made it clear she doesn't care about the money and asks him to run off with her before the wedding, knowing it will make their lives very difficult. Tyrion instead chose the easy way and married Sansa.
So in the show Shae is the sympathetic character. If Tyrion does kill her he will go from sympathetic to monster. I'm very confused as to why they wrote her this way if they want Tyrion to be a hero.
As for the actress, I love her portrayal.

1304	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-24	I don't see Shae's portrayal to date as precluding the chance that she's really a golddigger.  Yes, she wants to run off with Tyrion.  She also knows that Tyrion is an incredibly bright guy, and likely would do very well for himself even if he didn't manage to sneak off with a bunch of Lannister gold.  She also knows that as long as they are in KL, the relationship must be kept secret, and that it is over if it is ever discovered.  Staying with Tyrion in Westeros is no guarantee that the gravy train will keep flowing.
So, a calculating Shae may well decide that running off with Tyrion is a better long-term plan than staying in Westeros.  Tyrion, of course, doesn't want to leave because whatever he thinks about his father, he likes the other privileges that come with being a Lannister.

Not only because Shae was manipulative, but also because Tyrion didn't really try to get to know her. Theirs wasn't a relationship of equals. Tyrion paid her to fulfill his wishes, to be there for him, to do/talk about things Tyrion wanted and when he wanted... and then he sort of forgot their deal and started to think his "dream girl" as a real person. He was in love with his fantasy.And I also never thought the murder of Shae as justified. Tyrion would have been so much bigger a person if he had just left without harming anyone for revenge. I thought the killing of Shae was horrible and cruel (he strangled her), but in the same time it was awesome storytelling, because Martin had the guts to turn one of his main protagonists into such a dark character. Tywin's fate felt almost lame after that.

Yes it would have cost him everything, and that's why he went through with marrying Sansa.

But it's clearly stated that she's bought off by Cersei.You're right that the relationship was never really equal. However it goes both ways imo, you are right, Tyrion was paying for a virtual girl and never stopped to think what the real Shae was like. However, Shae knew why he was doing it, it was plain to see that he didn't value himself and thought himself beneath notice and incapable of being loved by anyone. She saw it and she played it up for all she was worth. And Tyrion was taken in by it, at least on some level, because otherwise he wouldn't have reacted with such rage and craziness when she betrayed him.I still think Shae's death was justified, but not the manner in which it happened. She sold him out knowing he would die, and as far as I'm concerned if he had been killed the blood would have been on her hands as much as Cersei's, so I don't think Tyrion wanting her dead is unusual in terms of Westeros justice. That doesn't mean that she deserved to be slowly strangled while gold hands dug into her flesh. If he'd had her beheaded later or something, I think that would have been better. A quick clean death.And yes, I absolutely agree Tyrion would have been a bigger, better person if he'd walked away. But then I don't think he'd really be a Lannister.

1308	JonCon's Red Beard	2013-05-24	When I say easy, I don't mean like "this is Tyrion being lazy", I mean more like he chose the path of least resistance. He could have stood up to his father - we see that from Edmure, rattling on about how Blackfish can't make him marry.

But, the choice was still there, he could have bolted with Shae and gone to Bravos or something and tried to make a living there. A very hard choice that could have resulted in both of them dying.Tyrion isn't Edmure. First, the Tullys love Edmure. Two, even if they don't, Edmure is the heir of the RIverlands, they won't simply turn his backs at him. Edmure HAD to accept the marriage because it was war time and someone had to clean Robb's mess, the less he asked was a pretty girl. In a different time, he could have refused her or some other girl he didn't like until he finds someone he really wants. And, even in the worst circumstances, Edmure is Edmure: he's still his father's son, a noble man and people would follow him or support him.The Lannister, otoh, don't love Tyrion, they don't care about him. Tywin can't kill him not get ride of him, but I'm surely he was just waiting for a good chance to do it, which eventually did happen. Also, Tyrion has no one that would willingly support him if he ever decides to try anything by himself: no one would follow Tyrion based on... what? honour? bravery?: Tyrion HAS to pay people to follow him and fight on his name. One could say that he even pays Bronn to be his friend besides his bodyguard.So, it looks like he did, but he had no choice. His situation was very much like Sansa's, she was given the choice to walk to the altar or being dragged, but she would go either way; Tywin wanted him married to Sansa: if he didn't he would offend his father even more than his own existence offends him.

And yes, Shae herself wasn't a wronged saint in her and Tyrion's relationship. I think we mostly agree about the nature of their affair.I just can't make myself accept the killing of Shae as justified since I'm personally against the death penalty, but sure, by the Westerosi standards there wouldn't have been any problems with executing Shae for giving a false testimony. Wanting Shae dead didn't turn Tyrion into a black hearted villain, imo, but the fact he chose a slow and painful way to do it and did it himself. I've always thought strangling as one of the most atrocious and cold-blooded ways to kill. One simply cannot do it without being some kind of monster (...well, maybe as a self-defence it could be acceptable).Tyrion is a great character, but I'm also really glad he's only fictional /thumbsup.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':thumbsup:' />

I'd like to think not, but I just don't know.If he does not "consummate" the marriage i.e. rape her because she is a child then he would hardly kill the same child now or later in a rage for something she might have done  back then when she still was was a child. They may see each other only a few years after the purple wedding.No at, the trial Tyrion did explicitely not blame Sansa when asked, but denied any guilt from hers. After all he had heard the lies Shae told about Sansa as well,  knowing that he and Sansa had never plotted together.Killing Shae was in no way justified but this was an emotionally extreme situation. No, I do not think this is the same like coldly slaughter a person who may have wronged him back when she still was a child even if he believes she was part of the murder plot. Tyrion even feels responsible for Sansa, guilty because he failed to protect her.No, really. Actually I guess it may be Sansa who tells Jaime that Tyrion had no part in killing Joffrey.I guess the idea of Tyrion murdering Sansa will make the Tyrion haters surface who always thought that Tyrion is Sansa's main antagonist in the story and this thread might get ugly after it has been nice for so long.
1312	Lothar	2013-05-25	I hope they won't sacrifice Tyrion evolution and greyness too much, and so will find a way to make him kill Shae (should be even stronger if they avoid making Shae a totally bad character).Now I suspect/fear, if Tysha is to be found in the books (something show authors know) they may have decided to make Shae replace Tysha as the lost love Tyrion will search.Tywin may force her to testimony then send her to an unknown place for Tyrion to find her some seasons later. In a TV perspective it makes more sense to make Tyrion search a character the viewer has seen and liked than an unknown figure of his past. Tysha may also replace Shae as the dead love (Tywin may tell he hanged Tysha and Tyrion kill him because of that).I hope so much that they change it to this in the show because Tyrion killing Shae made me instantly stop caring about his character in the books.  No, murdering a woman because she lied is not okay.  I don't think it makes him a gray character.  I think it just made him a cruel murderer. Even ignoring the fact that he had no way of knowing whether or not Shae was forced or threatened into giving the testimony.  That's what I assumed happened all the way until I read AFOC.If she had instead defended Tyrion in her testimony, it would have changed nothing.  It would still have been everyone at King's Landing against her.  Everyone believed he did it.  All defending him would amount to is likely Cersei killing her.  It's not like they were going to go "Oh, his whore says he's innocent.  Well then, he must not have done it.  Let him free."

1313	Newstar	2013-05-25	Honestly, it makes me worry about Sansa. He's thought about her a couple times and it always seems that he's thinking she betrayed him.I dunno. He's not "always" thinking she betrayed him. He lumps her in with Shae and with other "false" women the one time in ADWD, but his reaction to Sansa fleeing her marriage in ASOS is "What did you expect?" In ADWD, he seems pretty unconcerned about her. He calls her "false" the one time, as I said, but he also compares Penny "with all her pretty dreams" to Sansa late in ADWD, whom he describes as "the child bride he wed and lost" and not, say, as "that conniving, heartless bitch who framed me for murder." Whatever negative or resentful feelings he does hold towards Sansa as of ADWD--and he really doesn't seem to think much about her one way or the other--seem pretty mild for someone who has every reason to believe she murdered Joffrey and left him to take the blame for it. Honestly, he seems more pissed off in ASOS about her refusal to kneel at the wedding than anything else, and in ADWD, he can't even be bothered to think about that.I'm worried that if they do meet up again he might try to exact the same kind of revenge. I'd like to think not, but I just don't know.It might sound strange, but I don't think Tyrion loves or hates Sansa enough to try to exact any revenge on her, even if their paths were to cross again (I don't get the sense he would actively pursue her in order to get revenge). He doesn't think about her unprompted. He doesn't care about where she is, either to worry for her safety, or to wonder how he can track her down to get revenge. He leaves her out of his revenge fantasies. He can't be bothered to hate her overmuch, probably because hating Tywin, Cersei, etc. etc. takes too much emotional energy. He's spent so much hating other people, and dreaming up revenge on other people, that I don't think there's much left over to take out on Sansa, who's pretty much a non-entity for him in terms of his feelings about her. Whatever her "betrayal" was, because he never really loved her or cared about her and never believed that she loved him, it didn't sting the way Jaime and Shae's actions did, and therefore would be unlikely to provoke the same type of reaction should he get the opportunity to confront her about what she did. Again, my sense is that he really can't be bothered about her one way or the other, even if their paths were to somehow cross miraculously in the future.Some big murderous revenge scenario between Tyrion and Sansa in the event of their next meeting would require some level of toxic hatred--as with Tyrion and Cersei--or some perceived deep betrayal, as with Tyrion and Jaime, and that level of feeling vis-a-vis Sansa just isn't there for Tyrion.

1314	tmug	2013-05-25	I have always interpreted TV Shae as a real potential match for TV Tyrion. Scenes we've seen at the end of season 2 paralleled the Robb/Talisa marriage. It gave a imagery that Shae/Tyrion are paired even if it is not a true marriage of sorts, in Westerosi terms. That was given to the viewers perspective. 
Now if they want to make Tyrion go out as a hero as many people begrudgingly feel that he has become, they simply make due with the foreshadowing of Tywin threating to 'kill any whore he finds'. (i hate this scenario)
Joffery is poisoned, Sansa flees, Tyrion arrested, Shae is taken. Cersei already suspects this girl from the Blackwater ep. Ros is already dead and probably all sussed out. Varys knows everything about Shae and knowing how Varys spills everything on Tyrion at the trial, offering her up to Tywin would only earn Varys a little more trust on the council. 
It is really hard for me to envision Lord Tywin in bed with Tyrion's whore. They have portrayed him to be so vile and black that I even have a hard time of believing Tywin could consumate with anyone really. 
I can see Tywin torturing Shae for more information on Tyrion and Tyrion mercy kills Shae then avenges her death by killing Tywin. Yay! Tyrion = Hero, end Season 4. I dont prefer this ending but that is the feeling I get when i watch this series.
OR
They could be throwing us a curveball with all of this Shae/Tyrion lovey crap. Make us think that they might have a chance and then we see the real side of Shae and Tyrion and make them more human. Shae sees Tyrion arrested and then she jumps ship and finds another lion to ride.

It gave a imagery that Shae/Tyrion are paired even if it is not a true marriage of sorts, in Westerosi terms. That was given to the viewers perspective.I honestly don't see that.   Robb is a noble, idealistic guy, trying to do the right thing to help people. He falls for Talisa because she kind of sees things the same way in terms of doing what is right. Bingo -- it's a match.But I don't see the build-up for TV Shae loving Tyrion.  Tyrion loving her is easy to understand -- he's very desperate to be loved, and so is willing to believe that she loves him.  But Shae....did they ever show scenes explaining why she loved Tyrion?  I don't recall her ever talking about how good he is to her, or how smart he is, or how he's not appreciated by other people, or anything like that.  Never any real vulnerability, only that kind of temper under the surface.So I don't buy it.  Didn't buy it in the books, and I don't buy it here.  And, I don't think it makes sense for his character.  Tyrion is ugly as hell, wants to be loved for that anyway, yet also expects beautiful women to love him just for who he is without regard to looks.  It's his shallowness, or maybe his defense mechanism of throwing money at women so he really doesn't ever get judged for himself.  In any case, I think have Shae really love him is a bit to close to a reverse Pretty Woman scenario for me to like it.
1316	ugashep	2013-05-26	Tyrion murdering Tywin as revenge for killing Shae suuuuucks and I'd hate to see it.  It just cheapens so much to me and changes all that was good in Tyrion's ADWD story.  BUT, I acknowledge that TV-only viewers would enjoy it just fine.  I would be very surprised if they end up going any other route, really.  Pleasing book readers has never been the goal with this show, so I think it makes sense for Shae's death via Tywin to be what really fucks Tyrion up.  She can be his Tysha in the show (even though he has already talked about Tysha in the show, which I think is weird to include but whatever).I don't really know my point.  I don't like the idea of Tywin kills Shae--> Tyrion kills Tywin, but I think it makes sense for TV.I would really be pissed at the show if that happens, she needs to betray Tyrion and have Tyrion strangle her with the hand chain, it is key. Tyrion is Martin's favorite character, surely he would not let that happen.

Heavy hint!.....I mean will Joffrey really die from poisoning and not from gelding by guess whom.......The Imp has it in him, you'll see........after all, he is said to be the showmakers' favorite..........he'll get ALL the good killings.

But maybe they're foreshadowing Shae's death, not Sansa's. I'm hoping Sansa will be the Stark in Winterfell when all is said and done. I like her, in the books and the show.
1321	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-27	Shae refused a house, personal guards and as many items for their unborn children as Tyrion could buy just because she would rather not to see their children killed in their sleep by their grandfather.Doesn't sound like an ambitious woman to me.I think Shae was rightly worried about how long those promises would last once he was married and in Winterfell.
1322	Newstar	2013-05-27	"astonishingly long neck....."Cannot. Unsee.No, seriously, I think the "astonishingly long neck" bit was just the writers having a bit of fun with writing Tyrion as super awkward and nervous with Sansa, just as they were in the non-book scene where he's babbling on nervously about marriage to him being a type of prison. It was a bit of a change from the books, actually, because all his scenes with Sansa in the book were awkward, he wasn't particularly awkward, if that makes any sense. In the books, whatever he was feeling, he seemed fairly calm, not spewing out stream of consciousness word vomit like an idiot. In the book version of the pre-wedding scene (where he tells her he isn't Joffrey, etc. etc.), he seemed pretty collected; there was a bit of that towards the end of the TV scene, where he held Sansa's hand and managed a joke, but the scene was mostly played for laughs (marriage to him being a kind of prison). Between the writing in the 3x06 scene where Tyrion tells Sansa about the wedding, and the 3x08 Tyrion/Sansa scenes, it seemed like in the show the writers glommed on to the idea of Tyrion being horrifically awkward and completely discombobulated when he has to interact with Sansa one on one and ran with it.I honestly would laugh my ass off if Tyrion strangled Sansa.  I think the board would completely melt down.Oh, me too. And yes, yes it would.

So we'll see.

1325	ExBruinsFan	2013-05-27	I would really be pissed at the show if that happens, she needs to betray Tyrion and have Tyrion strangle her with the hand chain, it is key. Tyrion is Martin's favorite character, surely he would not let that happen.He can't stop it.
1326	BurningCandle	2013-05-28	My prediction is that Shae will NOT betray Tyrion, and Tywin will have her killed.That would totally suck. I would be furious if that were the case. Shae needs to betray him to kick off his downward spiral, otherwise all he's got powering him is righteous anger.
1327	Newstar	2013-05-28	That would totally suck. I would be furious if that were the case. Shae needs to betray him to kick off his downward spiral, otherwise all he's got powering him is righteous anger.Well, assuming it does play out with Shae not betraying Tyrion and Tywin having her killed coupled with Tyrion learning the truth about Tysha, it could trigger a downward spiral in a different sense: Tyrion realizing that Tysha truly loved him and she was victimized by Tywin, that Shae, a person he believed truly loved him, was victimized by Tywin in similar fashion, that they were victimized because of his relationship with them, and that he was powerless to prevent it both times. He failed Tysha by being unable to protect her from Tywin, and he failed Shae by being unable to protect her from Tywin. It would be less "righteous anger," and more crippling guilt at the fact that two women who loved him suffered for it and he was helpless to prevent it. It would be less "Everyone has betrayed me" as in the books and more "My family has betrayed me."Again, that's assuming it plays out as some are predicting it will (Shae remaining an innocent woman who loves Tyrion, brutally murdered by Tywin or his goons). We'll see. I expect the end result will be the same at any rate: Shae dead, Tywin murdered by Tyrion, and Tyrion fleeing to Essos.

1328	Woman of War	2013-05-28	Omygod, yes, there has been heavy foreshadowing: "astonishingly long neck.....", the showmakers must know why they introduced that line.And did you realize the shape of those leeches?? Heavy hint!.....I mean will Joffrey really die from poisoning and not from gelding by guess whom.......The Imp has it in him, you'll see........after all, he is said to be the showmakers' favorite..........he'll get ALL the good killings. And his Frey Pies are best, after all Jamie Oliver is his brother.Actually, now that I think about it that line is freaking weird. But maybe they're foreshadowing Shae's death, not Sansa's. I'm hoping Sansa will be the Stark in Winterfell when all is said and done. I like her, in the books and the show.BurningCandle, Darling, THIS.WAS.A.JOKE /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />Though ahem, you are just wishing death to Bran and Rickon. Actually I want little Rickon to be Chekhov's heir to Winterfell since Bran and Jon may have other purposes in the story.That would totally suck. I would be furious if that were the case. Shae needs to betray him to kick off his downward spiral, otherwise all he's got powering him is righteous anger.i think the show, just like the books needs that "downward spiral" of Tyrion. Apart from the great acting we would get from Dinklage Martin needs to have his character Tyrion down in the mud, a depressed alcoholic, to construct his way not to his old but to a better, stronger identity in impressive literature. After the death of his father AND SHAE the books will be a belated coming of age story for Tyrion (like they are for some other characters) with turning upside down all his priorities in the end. So he just has to be rock bottom in between, and HBO Tyrion should not be spared this.

1330	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-28	No at, the trial Tyrion did explicitely not blame Sansa when asked, but denied any guilt from hers. After all he had heard the lies Shae told about Sansa as well,  knowing that he and Sansa had never plotted together.I guess the idea of Tyrion murdering Sansa will make the Tyrion haters surface who always thought that Tyrion is Sansa's main antagonist in the story and this thread might get ugly after it has been nice for so long.To the extent Tyrion has negative thoughts about Sansa, I think that's just overflow from his general anger at everything that happened to him post PW.  As he regains his moral compass, I suspect his thought towards Sansa will be more along the lines of feeling sorry for her for all the things that happened to her.  Especially when (presumably not if) Littlefinger's role in all this has been made clear.

While I don't discount the possibility that Tyrion will be brought back to a setting and characters where past events like the PW are relevant,  I also think there is a possibility that such a revisiting never occurs. To take an example, I don't recall (and I may be wrong) that Catelyn ever learned that LF had tricked her regarding the dagger. Sometimes a character's story can conclude with aspects unresolved.

So we'll see.I also think this is how this season's progression has pointed for Shae. The Sansa/Tyrion story arc has served to begin to introduce tension between Shae and Tyrion and get to the same ultimate result. The tension comes from a different place than in the books, but it still serves to push Shae toward a place where she will look out for her own interests and get to a place where her emotional bond to Tyrion is just as much of a front as book Shae's is. There have been several scenes that begin to lay this down. By contrast, we have one threat from Tywin in the first episode about hanging the next whore who he discovers in Tyrion's bed.

But you're right, there is no guarantee.  I just think that so many major character arcs are linked to the PW that they'll likely get resolved at some point.  There's the whole issue of what happens to Littlefinger, Jaime's relationship with Tyrion, and the fact that both Tyrion and Sansa are currently blamed for Joffery's murder.  I'd find it hard to fathom that the series would end with them still being considered the culprits, but, you never know.I also think this is how this season's progression has pointed for Shae.

1336	Woman of War	2013-05-28	I'm not sure either but Tyrion will not stay THAT Tyrion in Martin's writing. He will be a most prominent character in the endgame and I guess we will see him change considerably. And I want to see that fascinating character in all his complexity.

1338	Newstar	2013-05-28	What about Tyrion giving Shae that chain a couple of episodes ago? You guys (gender neutral) don't think that was a little foreshadowing?It might very well be. On the other hand, it could be GRRM (or D&D, I think they tell him what scenes to write in his episodes and he writes them) winking at the book readers a little, just as the writers did with the rumours about Tyrion losing his nose in 3x01: showing a golden chain as a nod to the storyline in the books, in an entirely different context, in a way that seemed as if the chain wouldn't be incorporated into future storylines. Shae rejected the gift, remember.

1340	ugashep	2013-05-29	I think money is the main thing that drives changes between the show and the book. Maybe I'm not thinking of everything but it seems to me that the vast majority of the big changes from the book have been delaying the appearance of characters for a season so they wouldn't have to hire another actor, or like with Tyrion's nose, just giving him a scar that could be put on with make up rather than having to CGI part of his face for every episode from here on out. You also have some "changes" which are necessary for TV, keeping tabs on Robb or Joffrey even though they are not POV in the book, like the money situation, that's just practical.  D & D are cost conscious for real life reasons and then its HBO so they gotta have sexposition so we get some things cast against the background of sexual situations that weren't in the book. Changing Shae to being killed by Tywin and Tyrion killing Tywin out of revenge however is unnecessary for money reasons, and it deals with a major character's arc, I would be surprised if they went there.  They may of course, but my money is on them keeping it the way it was in the book, we'll see.

1341	JMJ	2013-05-29	ugashep,
I think you are spot on with that. There are for better or worse real-life constraints on what the show can portray, and most of those are budgetary. I think when this show was greenlighted, it must have been understood by all that there would be limited special effects and limits on the huge epic scenes. The appeal of this story for a TV series is that so much of the story is political intrigue, with a sprinkling of magic and fantasy.
1342	silentwanderer	2013-05-29	What about Tyrion giving Shae that chain a couple of episodes ago?I see it as the same kind of teasing as Joffrey drinking a cup of wine right after Stannis threw the leech with his name in the fire.We're led to believe Tyrion'd use the chain to kill Shae the way we read it on the books and then throw a last minute change - like Tywin killing Shae as he promised - on the show.

I'll be surprised and disappointed if he lets the show change Tyrion's arc that dramatically.Tyrion in the books was a rude and offensive, but generally decent guy up until Joffrey's death. At that point he takes a notable swing downward. Lying to Jamie about Joffrey was dark and cruel. So are the slaying of Shae and Tywin, although they are debatably more justified. Tyrion has been cruel before, but not to that level. That's three significant acts of revenge that should haunt Tyrion in the later novels. If they don't happen in the show, then it suggests that there's no significant impact for anything in the books that we haven't read yet. That would stink.

If it wasn't nice for Tyrion to lie about having poisoned Joffrey (a lie that didn't actually cause any harm to anyone), what must it have been like for Tyrion to hear for the first time that his brother had been lying to him for all these years, that Tysha was not a whore but a crofter's daughter, and to realize that he was complicit to some extent to what happened to her?  It was that revelation that made him snap, and it's not hard to see why.  All the shit he's just been through, wrongly condemned to death, and now he finds out that the event that dominated his outlook on life was much worse than he had ever known?  And that Jaime was complicit in lying to Tyrion about her?To me, Tyrion's lie about Joffrey is a bump on a gnat's ass compared to Jaime's lie to Tyrion.

The shock coming from the fact we are expecting something completely different if we read the books.Tysha was a "whore" in the books until Jaime tells us otherwise, which may or may not happen, but my guess is it will. The point is that Shae in the books has a surprising betrayal because she actually says fuck it I just want to be with you. On the show, if Shae is sulky and pissed for every episode we're going to think, well that was sort of expected if she does betray him. Thus less shocking.

They established their belief that Tysha was a whore, which is necessarily based on what Tyrion told them. That's the whole point, and why the reveal from Jaime that she was not a whore is still completely possible.I really hope they don't omit that, because it helps explain whey Tyrion could snap the way he did.  Simply being released by Jaime, and then going upstairs and killing Tywin and Shae) would not make sense to me.But Jamie telling Tyrion?  I envision that scene as Jaime saying "She wasn't a whore, Tyrion, she really was a crofter's daughter, and she really did love you.", and that Tyrion recoiling in horror and self-loathing with "Don't you understand?  He made me do it too!  I raped my own wife and tossed her a fucking gold coin!", and then, *snap*.

1356	silentwanderer	2013-05-30	Season 1, Baelor episode.
Its how Bronn and Shae figured out Tysha was a whore; no woman who actually went through what Brienne of Tarth went through this season would've had sex with a Lannister brother two hours later (Brienne didn't, Tysha did). 
And they weren't Tywin's soldiers, they were men Jaime hired to pretend Tysha was almost raped.

He was a person the commoner girl Tysha had never before met: witty, kind, caring, interesting and first of all: not threatening. Vanilla kind of sexy. He was so different from the violent guys on the road that he may have been hugely interesting to the inexperienced girl Tysha who may have seen broad shouldered tall guys as nothing but threatening. I guess little Tyrion was charming, cute , curious and imaginative. The right mixture for first sex at thirteen when sex should always be a little " vanilla".
1358	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-30	Season 1, Baelor episode.Its how Bronn and Shae figured out Tysha was a whore; no woman who actually went through what Brienne of Tarth went through this season would've had sex with a Lannister brother two hours later (Brienne didn't, Tysha did).And they weren't Tywin's soldiers, they were men Jaime hired to pretend Tysha was almost raped.Wait a minute.  Are you talking about when Tysha was saved by Tyrion, or when she was being punished by Tywin?  In terms of the initial saving, I never got the sense that the rape was actually consummated.  I thought that it was interrupted by Tyrion, and in that sense, in that much more brutal world, I don't see it as completely implausible that she did sleep with him afterwards.

Are you talking about when Tysha was saved by Tyrion, or when she was being punished by Tywin?  I'm talking about what happened in Game of Thrones the show. Not the A Song of Ice and Fire  books.
1361	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-31	I'm talking about what happened in Game of Thrones the show. Not the A Song of Ice and Fire  books.So am I, but no matter.The disagreement is on whether a woman in Westeros whose assault was interrupted by another man might conceivably sleep with the rescuer a few hours later.  Actually, I suppose the actual disagreement is whether GRRM/D&D believe that is conceivable, since what we're really debating is whether or not they believe that precludes her from not being a whore.
1362	King's Ruin	2013-06-06	As the saying goes, Tyrion is 'trying to turn a ho into a housewife...' Shae is just a greedy bitch. When it looks like Tyrion is sinking she jumps ship without thinking twice about it BECAUSE GRRM IS FEARLESS WHEN IT COMES TO PEOPLE MAKING BOLD OUTRAGEOUS MOVES in 'the game'
1363	Wolf of Winterfell	2014-01-30	It is really hard to imagine Tywin and Shae in bed together. I can imagine this Shae betraying Tyrion at the trial and making a mockery of him, but sleeping with Tywin? And Tywin sleeping with her?


I'm having the same problem, the very idea of it makes me shudder. Shae...I almost kind of like her in the show, I keep hoping she won't betray him on the show but something tells me she will.
1364	Charles Phipps	2014-02-02	I think this is a fairly easy puzzle to fill in the missing pieces too.

Shae is very very angry at the fact Tyrion is choosing his life in King's Landing over her and she's feeling all of the social constraints of being just a whore when he's saying she's his mistress. Either it's a romance or its a business transaction and Tyrion is giving her mixed signals. In the end, though, the series is about people making bad choices for good reasons. When Tyrion is condemned, Shae will probably choose between being executed or being freed.
Even without any bad feelings to him, she'd probably choose being freed. Then Tywin will use her like a whore and Tyrion, not in the best state of mind, will kill her.

How very human.

1366	TimeforTravel	2014-03-26	Hello!

While rewatching Game of Thrones season 3 I noticed something peculiar at the end of the episode "Second Sons" and I can't find anything on the web about it. But when Sam runs away with Gilly they are being followed by a pack of ravens and at the far end a blue flame is burning. It burns all the time and it's visible for like five seconds. Any theories on what it is?

Some pictures:

Ah well, I'm not allowed to post images. Look it up for yourself then. A bright blue flame, as blue as wight's eyes burns in between the trees in the last shot of Gilly, Sam and the ravens.

Two different frames of the light/flame. I'm not sure if it moves or if it's just the ravens that fly before it but I'm pretty sure it does move when you watch it in animation.

1375	amilas	2013-05-20	I'm a little nervous to actually start this thread myself, but here goes!
What does everyone think about the Tyrion/Sansa dynamic going on? Clearly this continues Tyrion's "whitewashing" but I, personally, find this a bit enjoyable. We got to see Tyrion's lush side for the first time in ages, and it reminds us that he is NOT perfect. It also reinforces that he is not willing to hurt or use Sansa and that he is afraid of his father.
There was so much going on during the wedding scene. I think it was brilliantly done, even if it didn't adhere completely to canon.
1376	Grandpa House	2013-05-20	First of all, I understand the Tyrion "whitewashing" because book-Tyrion is waaay too grey of a character for a TV audience to like/connect with him. They needed a (for the most part) "good guy" leading role after Ned died. His flaws are still there, but they are presented as a lot more forgivable.
And more importantly regarding the wedding scene, who else heard them playing "The Bear and the Maiden Fair"?! It was just an instrumental and in the background, but I was all like 'that sounds familiar' and quickly realized it was the same tune the Bolton bannermen had been singing in the other eps.
Also hearing the show-composer's version of the song played on actual instruments had me a lot more "sold" on it, until then I hadn't been a fan of his take just by how it sounded with dudes singing it.

1377	Tony Soprano	2013-05-20	I thought the whole wedding was great. Both Peter Dinklage and Sophie Turner did a great job, they really made the wedding as awkward as I imagined it was in the books. 
I like what they're doing with Tyrion. They're showing viewers that even he has flaws, even he has a dark side, but they're not taking it too far. I liked how he was kind and respectufl to Sansa. Like the poster above me said, Tyrion is the leading " good guy " right now.
1378	David Selig	2013-05-20	First of all, I understand the Tyrion "whitewashing" because book-Tyrion is waaay too grey of a character for a TV audience to like/connect with him.No, he's not. There's been plenty of main characters just as bad or worse as book Tyrion who are loved by TV audiences. Nucky Thompson or Tony Soprano for example.

They needed a (for the most part) "good guy" leading role after Ned died. His flaws are still there, but they are presented as a lot more forgivable.I agree in how that is why Mad Men, Breaking Bad, The Sopranos, Deadwood and Dexter all do so terribly in how TV watchers just won't watch a show with grey or dark characters.Also, might I ask what flaws?edit: Moreover, it seems like many TV fans have been able to enjoy Theon and Jaime both characters that commit violent crimes against children on the show.Also, maybe they can focus on Robb, Catelyn, Jon, Dany, Davos, Brienne, Sansa, and Bran if they need lighter characters for fans to root for and connect with like in the books.

1380	Effie	2013-05-20	I liked the wedding with everything that was going on, including Joffrey being Joffrey and Cersei explaining the song, which of course will be very important next week.
So many people still dislike Sansa because she's not speaking up and acting 'stupid' and 'dull', but especially with her mentioning that she's only 14, this puts all that criticism in perspective. I think Sophie does a remarkable job at playing Sansa. 
With Tyrion now being the overall good guy though, I feel most people forget that it's still a horrid thing for Sansa to be married to him, which was a lot clearer in the books.
1381	The Knight of Flours	2013-05-20	I liked that Sansa told the TV audience she was 14.  Next week I look forward to Dany doing the same.
1382	Minsc	2013-05-20	I liked that Sansa told the TV audience she was 14.  Next week I look forward to Dany doing the same.I think Dany is eighteen because how RR was 18 years in the past, moreover she actually has sex scenes they had to show thus she has to be of age.
1383	Newstar	2013-05-20	You know, despite all the whitewashing, the various book-show changes, and the wedding night being toned down considerably and whatnot, I don't think the dynamic between the two by the end of 3x08 was very different from where it was in the books, as suggested by the end of the wedding night scene and the morning scene. Sansa is awkward and miserable; Tyrion is awkward and miserable (except for his small smile at Shae); and a grim, strained silence hangs over the proceedings. It seems like their vibe is about what it was pre-Red Wedding.

i think joffery already started believing himself as a pure lannister and not baratheon.

Just to give her some emotion other than being clueless and manipulated by others at all times.

I especially liked the addition of Joffrey removing the stool to be a complete douchebag to Tyrion. I thought Tyrion played the drunk scene well though I'll admit I expected him to get back to their room and be completely stone sober to show it was an act to protect both himself as well as Sansa.One line they left in which always struck me as so pointed in the book was when Sansa said "What if I never want to?" when Tyrion gave her his word he would not bed her until she wanted it. The actors did such a good job of that scene. Tyrion's obvious pain at being reminded of his ugly dwarfism (as well as being a hated Lannister even though he's hated by his own family) was palpable and well done.And I really hope this thread does not break down into more "whitewashing of Tyrion" crying because that noise has gotten really stale in past weeks. Let it go already.

1388	Mulled Wino	2013-05-20	Twas probably my favorite tyrion scene so far this season.  Loved oleana laughing at the chaos and tywin publicly dressing him and being a dick.
Good thing the producers were reading my complainy posts about the lannisters last 2 weeks and made the proper adjustments
1389	Greywolf2375	2013-05-20	Glad I'm not the only one who noticed that strange line ... he said that and I was thinking "hmm... he's not really supposed to outwardly be a Lannister ... slip of the tongue?" or maybe they did that on purpose to remind viewers of the incest facts just so they'll not forget why Joffrey's claim to the throne is a complete sham.It's not really that strange - the Lannisters have always been shown to have an extreme amount of arrogance.  Quartering the kings colors with their own in the heraldry is a perfect example of it.  It's not that he doesn't think he is a Baratheon, he doesn't care because of the importance put on by being a Lannister.I felt the wedding scene was done to perfection. I especially liked the addition of Joffrey removing the stool to be a complete douchebag to Tyrion.I didn't like it.  A lot of the awkwardness was there, but I did very much dislike her kneeling - that was one last public show of defiance to the people who killed her father.  Having her walk out arm in arm with a small smile on her face and then this really did take away from abhorrence to her situation she has.
1390	Mulled Wino	2013-05-20	I agree, I think it's a dynamic fairly similar to the books.However, I wouldn't mind for Sansa to be somewhat conflicted by the fact that while she hates the Lannisters and wants to get away from them, her Lannister's husband isn't actually that bad.

1391	KoishNoish	2013-05-20	I think the wedding was really well done. The music was great and the acting just as good. Honestly Jack Gleeson if I didn't know you were acting as Joffrey... I know some people will be upset Sansa knelt but to me I don't think they could have had her remain standing without her appearing to be a total dick. I mean Tyrion is the fan favorite for the TV show, which is fine, but they couldn't exactly have Sansa do what we could easily understand in the books and transfer it to screen without it looking like simply being a dick. I think the scenes were really well done, just as awkward as I thought it should be (Olenna with Marg and Cersei with Loras didn't exactly help much there) and I couldn't stop laughing after Tyrion just stumbled over and passed out. Excellently done.
Also just as an add-on, some people are upset and think Sansa's character is descending into a bottomless pit of despair and I get where your coming from but if you want 'your' Sansa go read the books again. The TV show is changing some events and characters and I personally have decided to regard the TV show and the books as their own separate works of art. I can still enjoy the TV Show without it having to keep word to word with the books. Whenever I want to go back to the book characters I go back to the books themselves. I just find it an easier mentality. /cool4.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':cool4:' />
1392	Mother of Mini Dragons	2013-05-20	I thought it was done really well. I was worried about the Tyrion whitewashing affecting Sansa's emotional arc, but it was still hit both with her mentioning her age and Tyrion get outright drunk and making her already humiliating wedding day even more humiliating.
I wanted to punch Joffrey in the face as soon as he walked up to Sansa in the sept to walk her down. That smug little look on his face!  They are also doing a great job of setting up the animosity between Joffrey and Tyrion.
1393	SeventySeven	2013-05-20	id prefer her to be unyielding and loathe everything about all of the lannisters militantly.Yeah, but in the show it will never happen. So I'd rather they showed her conflicted than consistently lost at all times.

I guess my real question is, at what point did he change from believing Robert was his father to totally embracing the fact he's a product of incest?And I guess I shouldn't have said the scene was 'perfection' since yes they did in fact go ahead and have her kneel anyways. I'm thinking this was done to make Tyrion look even more the hero since Joffrey took his stool. I'm sure many will continue gnashing their teeth over this 'whitewashing' theme but I don't really care anymore, I like Tyrion the way they've changed him in the show just fine... much moreso than the way they've changed many other characters like Stannis, Catelyn, etc.
1395	Quiet Sister	2013-05-20	I guess my real question is, at what point did he change from believing Robert was his father to totally embracing the fact he's a product of incest?Hi,are we sure indeed he's embraced his true parentage or that he knows about it at all? Him saying he's a Lannister is perfectly understandable thing. Why should he identify with his dead father who never been truly fatherly towards him, his dead uncle-traitor and usurper, and another uncle - also traitor and usurper? He's got Lannister's looks, his strength and family ties are with Lannisters. Although his name is Barathreon, for him it's a name only of almost extinct family of people he generally hates. He may be Barathreon by birth  /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' /> but in his heart he's a Lannister like his grandfather, mother and uncle Jaime.My first /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />

That said I think they did alter the timeline to make her 18.Hi,are we sure indeed he's embraced his true parentage or that he knows about it at all?He at least knows of it, as he confronted cersei about it last season. Whether he's accepted it or not is a different question altogether.

1397	Warhawk137	2013-05-20	Y'know, with all the people complaining about how the show's portrayal of Tyrion makes Sansa look bad, I think there's actually a big opportunity here to conduct some character development if the show handles it properly.  So, maybe viewers are critical of Sansa for not being nicer to Tyrion, because Tyrion is a pretty decent bloke on the show.  Well, how about if in the next few episodes, pre-Purple Wedding, Sansa starts changing her mind on Tyrion, by way of comparison with Joffrey in particular - moreso than she did in the books.  They could do a good job contrasting how the news of the Red Wedding affects her by showing how Joffrey treats her in the wake of that news versus how Tyrion does.  Maybe things are just starting to look up when the PW happens, and she ends up "escaping" with Littlefinger (she certainly has good reason to even if in the show she ends up liking Tyrion more than in the books, for fear of Cersei).  That would add a nice element of tragedy to what will otherwise be a rather exuberant response to the PW - Sansa gets to grow as a character and then just as she's getting to a place where we think she might be able to find at least a certain amount of contentedness in her situation, events conspire to take that away from her again.

Is it awful to be married to your enemy's family? Totally, but at the beginning of the books Sansa was *all* up ons to be married to Joff, before she found out what he really was, and even if he were a Baratheon and not a product of incest, he's still part-Lannister at the end of the day. Truthfully, I think that if she's gotta be married to a Lannister, having one that's not going to force her into sex, even when Daddy puts pressure on him? Not so bad.However, I wouldn't mind for Sansa to be somewhat conflicted by the fact that while she hates the Lannisters and wants to get away from them, her Lannister's husband isn't actually that bad. Just to give her some emotion other than being clueless and manipulated by others at all times.Agreed. This this this. I'm hoping that somewhere in there she actually starts thinking about the fact that Tyrion has protected her a time or six.I will never say that Tyrion is Ned, but my issue with all the "whitewashing" critics is the idea that in the novels, Tyrion does indeed do some good things and protect some of the weak: thus, a true neutral.I'm sure many will continue gnashing their teeth over this 'whitewashing' theme but I don't really care anymore, I like Tyrion the way they've changed him in the show just fine... much moreso than the way they've changed many other characters like Stannis, Catelyn, etc.This.

1400	Queen Elsa	2013-05-20	I read a tv review from the internet the writer hoping Sansa will see the goodness in Tyrion, just like how Shae sees it in him.  I rolled my eyes. Well, the guy just swears he won<U+0080><U+0099>t hurt her.  The words sound familiar, btw.

Who killed her father. And mother. And brother. If Sansa realised that this union could actually be a happy one for her, in a world where she's to be given away only for her status and value as a "thing", it would make it even more tragic. The one happiness she could have, is also the one she can't allow herself to have. And then she loses it all, anyway. I hope they're going down this road.

And the biggest "whitewashing" was done to Sandor here when he, correctly, emphazised that he had saved Sansa from getting raped.

And this so-called whitewashing in fact was an enrichment.And I think that Sansa kneeled not only in order not to humiliate Tyrion but as well in order to defy Joffrey, since she that way she could spoil his joke. After all she had spoken up with some courage before Joffrey led her to the altar, she showed pride and did not do Joffrey the favor to tremble and cry.In general I liked the more adult and stronger Sansa better than book Sansa, she was determined to get over with the bedding, like a painful but necessary visit to the dentist, but spoke her mind clearly, not like a trembling mouse when it came to telling her dislike.
1403	Ser Pounce FTW	2013-05-20	id prefer her to be unyielding and loathe everything about all of the lannisters militantly.But that didn't even happen in the books. Sansa acknowledged that Tyrion wasn't bad to her when questioned by Lysa in the Eryie.The actor needs to be of age, not the character they are portraying. That said I think they did alter the timeline to make her 18.No, the actors need to play a character of age if that character engages in sexual acts. Martin confirmed all of this before season 1 began to explain why the actors were aged up.

1405	Warhawk137	2013-05-20	Many likes to you, Envie.That "whitewashing Tyrion" gets boring. And the biggest "whitewashing" was done to Sandor here when he, correctly, emphazised that he had saved Sansa from getting raped. Only the show never showed him threatening her with precisly that like in the books. And this so-called whitewashing in fact was an enrichment.I like how they handle Sandor in the show.  He's clearly a deeply troubled man, but in some ways he seems like one of the only sane people in Westeros, because he has what so many people lack - perspective.  Seriously like half his screentime is spent pointing out to various people how stupid they're acting, and I enjoy every bit of it.I would pay money if D&D would insert a line in Episode 10, post RW, where Sandor basically just says "Seven hells, is everyone on this continent a fucking idiot?"
1406	Kasrith	2013-05-20	No, he's not. There's been plenty of main characters just as bad or worse as book Tyrion who are loved by TV audiences. Nucky Thompson or Tony Soprano for example.It's different when they are the main characters of the show, and who's story you are following throught. Hell you even 'watch' the show from their POV. This isn't the case with Tyrion, or any single character of GoT
1407	bobbybuilderton	2013-05-20	I think they might make Sansa and Tyrion mirror Catelyn and Jon.
In the way that Catelyn could deep down tell that Jon didn't do anything but exist but still couldn't bring herself to love him, I think we might see Sansa acknowledge that he's respecting her and defending her but still be unable to bring herself to love him. I think I would like it if they have Sansa mirroring her mother for two reasons.
1)Her mother is soon to be dead. We see that Ned lives on in his kids, and it'd be nice to see a bit of Catelyn surviving
2)It makes LF's weird obsession with her make even more sense. She not only looks like Catelyn but she also acts like her.
1408	julyleo	2013-05-20	I think what the show is trying to do is make what tyrion will eventually do to both his father and shae more of a slap in the face for tv audiences. I don't look at it as him being whitewashed at all. Honestly I prefer it,ultimately it will make him much more grey in the end.
1409	KSims1868	2013-05-20	Tyrion played the drunk scene well though I'll admit I expected him to get back to their room and be completely stone sober to show it was an act to protect both himself as well as Sansa.Yes - I totally expected this as well.  Surprised it didn't go that way.
1410	Warhawk137	2013-05-20	Agree 100%.  I'd also point out that book Sansa actually was ashamed of having humiliated Tyrion, which is an emotion that would have been lost without that internal monologue when translated to the screen.  Not having her commit an action (refusing to knee) that she quickly regretted is actually more consistent with her book character than showing a refusal to kneel without the internal monologue of shame/regret.SHould also point out that immediately prior to the ceremony, Sansa herself tells Tyrion "you were kind to me."  All those folks arguing that Sansa should be carrying all this rage against Tyrion are overlooking the fact that even bookd Sansa did not.Yeah, I think where Sansa is at this point in the story is that she's grown enough and been through enough to realize, at least on reflection, that she's been wrong about a great many things, and that many of her preconceptions of what the world is like were just illusions, but not quite enough to have the willpower to let go of some of those illusions and change her actions as a result.  So, in that sense, her actions often reflect the way in which she used to think of the world, even if deep down she doesn't believe some of those things anymore.Apparent on the show too.  Remember, in episode 6 or 7 (forget which), when she asked Shae if her family would be invited to the wedding?  I don't think she really believed, in her mind, that it was a realistic question, but she asks it anyway because she's using those illusions to try to essentially stay sane in the face an extremely stressful situations.  She may be clinging to the person she used to be, even after seeing what the world is really like, because she's afraid that if she stops doing that, she won't be able to find meaning in the world.  Her entire worldview was constructed around this concept of a fairy tale kind of chivalry - for her to completely succumb to realism would be very damaging to her psyche, so she constructs a facade to pretend that what she used to believe might still hold true.

1411	silentwanderer	2013-05-20	What does everyone think about the Tyrion/Sansa dynamic going on? Personally, I think he's a good husband and Shae seems to agree. However, Sansa is no Daenerys so I don't see how could she give this a chance.Fortunately, by the terms Tyrion established, that doesn't have to be problem for him or Shae.
1412	Kasporio	2013-05-20	Peter dinklage is fuck..g great! But i have a doubt since season about "Shae ain't staying with Tyrion for money but the genuinely love him".
Loved the books Shae. Then i wondered "why would she betray him? jealousy for Sansa?" It's taking this way, which is highly predictable and boring. Well, w8 and see.
1413	Newstar	2013-05-20	Then i wondered "why would she betray him? jealousy for Sansa?"It's taking this way, which is highly predictable and boring. Well, w8 and see.I thought that, too, but 3x08 seems to have resolved that, judging by the smile between Shae and Tyrion. I think they'll be pretty functional as a couple again until the PW, at which point Shae will likely betray Tyrion to save herself.I'm more curious about how the escape plot will be reintroduced. Unlike in the books, where there was only one escape plan since ACOK and Sansa could just revert to the default when her marriage to Loras fell through and she was married off to Tyrion instead, there are two escape plans in the show: Littlefinger's first plan to take Sansa away with him when he departed for the Vale (which fell through), and the second plan, which we don't know anything about yet.Since there is a second escape plan, it will have to be introduced at some point (I'm thinking 3x10, since it looks like Sansa and the rest of the KL crew sit out 3x09), by someone. (The "someone" is a bit tricky, since Littlefinger's still in the Vale, Dontos has been MIA since Season 2, Ros is dead, and Shae is an unlikely ally for Littlefinger since she trusts him about as far as she can throw him, but it will have to be someone.) So I'm guessing Sansa will be approached by someone in 3x10 with the new plan to get her out of KL.

ETA: Sansa is doing nothing wrong her.  She's not 'not being nice to him.'  She is 14 and doesn't want to sleep with him, for perfectly good reasons.  She doesn't categorically state that she never will.. she just asks 'what if?'
Both of them are being as nice as is to be expected.  Tyrion could be a little less drunk, but can you blame him?

1415	Wouter	2013-05-20	Allthough I'm 100% on Sansa's side in regards to the wedding in the books, I have no problems with the way they showed it on the TV series.The circumstances are different.-Tyrion told her about the marriage almost as soon as he knew, he didn't wait until 5 minutes before (and in the show he also didn't bother to make it appear she "had a choice" by mentioning Lancel as an option, allthough the other Lannisters would not have accepted that at the point he made the "offer)-Tyrion asked her to kneel instead of tugging at her skirt; not only is this more polite, it also makes it harder for Sansa to do as if she didn't notice or understood. Book Sansa would have done as asked, too, if she had been asked (or commanded). It should also be noted that Sansa did see that Joffrey took the stool away, and she didn't kneel of her own volition - that's why I think Tyrion asking  her was important.-In the show, a footstool was already present but Joffrey took it away deliberately. Sansa has little reason to indulge, more than necessary, in Joffrey's sadism. Sansa may not have shown strength by not kneeling, but then it would have been inappropriate under those (different from the book) circumstances. That she had to be prompted to kneel is enough already. She did show strength, again, in how graceful and controlled she was, unlike Cersei who lost her shit once more. Sansa is well suited to the role of queen or lady of a great castle, way better than Cersei is.I also liked it that Tyrion was unable to drape the cloak around her shoulders until she actually agreed to kneel. Showing that his "protection" is a sham until she actually willingly accepts it - which may or may not happen in the future (not necessarily in marriage). The wedding was also sufficiently awkward for both. Having Tyrion so drunk was an extra reason for Sansa to be embarrassed and unhappy, so I'm glad they did that, as the audience may relate to her more. Also liked little touches like Tywin being annoyed at people laughing at a Lannister - not explicitly shown in the equivalent book chapter but so very much in-character. The "one heart, one flesh, one soul, now and forever" sounded rather definite. I wonder if one possible reason for the softening of the marriage is that it may not be quite over yet.
1416	gash	2013-05-20	i thought it was a great scene with little difference to the book. i know tyrion's detractors were desperate for this scene to be a "whitewash" but it was not at all.
1417	Newstar	2013-05-20	The "one heart, one flesh, one soul, now and forever" sounded rather definite. I wonder if one possible reason for the softening of the marriage is that it may not be quite over yet.Anything's possible, I guess. I did notice that in the scenes after the wedding, Sansa was sporting a wedding ring on her ring finger (she didn't have a wedding ring in the books). She's also wearing it in the HBO still from 3x10. If she ditches that ring when she escapes King's Landing (or before), that will probably a strong hint from the writers that the marriage will be annulled and/or that Sansa and Tyrion will never meet again.

So Sansa already has the ring by the end of 3x08.

I was so shocked with the handling of the wedding scene that I didn't even notice.I thought the previous episode's scene with Margery and Sansa felt forced, and would have loved if they had some close-ups of Sansa's reactions during the wedding.  Seeing everything from the male gaze makes me think D&D don't really understand some of the nuances that make the book series great.The wedding does highlight one of my great disappointments in the TV series; with the exception of R'hllor, most of the religious context that Westeros is set in has vanished.  I really felt that the religions and the religious conflict was one of the more interesting aspects of the book series, and definitely helped understand some characters' motivations and POV better.
1422	WiDMNDBAMMD	2013-05-20	I agree, the Lannisters are definitely arrogant enough and Joffrey just insane enough to flaunt his parentage even if just in a private threat to Sansa. I guess my real question is, at what point did he change from believing Robert was his father to totally embracing the fact he's a product of incest?I don't think he does. He has a suspicion. Joffrey is heralded as Joffrey of Houses Baratheon and Lannister. His sigil is a stag and lion facing eachother. Joffrey puts his mother's house as equal to his father's house. This is pointed out in the books very clearly. In the show not so much.Sansa views Joffrey as a Lannister as well, she points it out to Arya and Ned season one, and to Margaery last episode.Since there is a second escape plan, it will have to be introduced at some point (I'm thinking 3x10, since it looks like Sansa and the rest of the KL crew sit out 3x09), by someone. (The "someone" is a bit tricky, since Littlefinger's still in the Vale, Dontos has been MIA since Season 2, Ros is dead, and Shae is an unlikely ally for Littlefinger since she trusts him about as far as she can throw him, but it will have to be someone.) So I'm guessing Sansa will be approached by someone in 3x10 with the new plan to get her out of KL.What if she just finds the note that says "come to the Godswood tonight alone if you wish to escape Kingslanding" ?That works without having to introduce anyone to the story.
1423	silentwanderer	2013-05-20	i thought it was a great scene with little difference to the book.The key difference to me is that Tyrion's relationship with Shae prevents him from any attachment to Sansa.And Sansa has no idea her husband isn't attracted to her.
1424	Wouter	2013-05-20	That's what I thought before 3x08, since the 3x10 still showed Cersei with what looked like an open jewelry box, but in the wedding feast and wedding night scenes, Sansa is already wearing the ring, meaning she acquired it as part of the wedding ceremony. So Sansa already has the ring by the end of 3x08.I missed that. Still, she will ditch the ring, she can't wear it after events in (early) S4. And it's not like it has sentimental value to keep, either. Arianne Flint; we also got a hearttree in this episode. I'm positive the Seven and the Old Gods will be further explored, in due time.
1425	WiDMNDBAMMD	2013-05-20	Anything's possible, I guess. I did notice that in the scenes after the wedding, Sansa was sporting a wedding ring on her ring finger (she didn't have a wedding ring in the books).

If she ditches that ring when she escapes King's Landing (or before), that will probably a strong hint from the writers that the marriage will be annulled and/or that Sansa and Tyrion will never meet again.I think they'll probably use the ring like they did the doll that Ned Stark gave her as a present season one(that she still has /crying.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':crying:' /> )Meaning when she looks at the ring she'll be wondering about Tyrion, she obviously can't wear the ring once she goes into hiding with a different identity.
1426	Wouter	2013-05-20	The key difference to me is that Tyrion's relationship with Shae prevents him from any attachment to Sansa.And Sansa has no idea her husband isn't attracted to her.I actually think he is. In the show, he was still hurt when Sansa said "what if ... never?". Much like in the books, only in the books Shae doesn't care. But her character is very different on the show, where she seems to generally love Tyrion and want to marry him.Shae noticed the sheets were clean. Would that mean Tywin won't hear immediately, or is there a chance Shae is putting on a really good act and actually spying for Tywin?
1427	Newstar	2013-05-20	I missed that. Still, she will ditch the ring, she can't wear it after events in (early) S4. And it's not like it has sentimental value to keep, either.Maybe she leaves it behind at the PW feast and that's how Tyrion in the aftermath of Joffrey's death realizes she's gone? That could work.And Sansa has no idea her husband isn't attracted to her.TV Tyrion is attracted to Sansa to some extent, although he feels guilty about it (David Benioff said as much on the most recent Inside the Episode segment), which is why he makes a big show of insisting Sansa's a child, claiming he has no desire for her, etc. etc. Loyalty to Shae had nothing to do with his decision to refuse to consummate the marriage.

1428	Wouter	2013-05-20	What if she just finds the note that says "come to the Godswood tonight alone if you wish to escape Kingslanding" ?That works without having to introduce anyone to the story.The show runners have alluded to the return of Ser Dontos (presumably to pick-up his original role from the books, the parts that still matter at least). But that may also be postponed to next season, I suppose; this season's finale could also work.
1429	Buckwheat	2013-05-20	I think Tyrion told himself that he wants Sansa. He told Shae he thinks her pretty and he said to Sansa he would do it.I actually think he is. In the show, he was still hurt when Sansa said "what if ... never?". Much like in the books, only in the books Shae doesn't care. But her character is very different on the show, where she seems to generally love Tyrion and want to marry him.Shae noticed the sheets were clean. Would that mean Tywin won't hear immediately, or is there a chance Shae is putting on a really good act and actually spying for Tywin?I do not think she is putting on an act and will go tell Tywin about the sheets now. Their relationship was proved so many times. And Shae even threatened to another maid in s2 in order to protect Sansa, so she even cares for her.
1430	Arianne Flint	2013-05-20	Wouter - we've seen heart trees before, but I highly doubt they'll ever deeply explore any of it (old gods or the new).  Very similar to how they mention maester's chains but never what it really represents to the maester.  To the non-reader, it doesn't mean much of anything.  I think the religions are different enough and don't really have much analogy to current religions that they would have been worth exploring in season 1, but now that we're in season 3 and it doesn't get discussed except for some created scenes between Melisandre and Thoros, I don't think we're going to get much of anything that will be very satisfying.
Buckwheat - I agree.  TV Shae seems extremely devoted to Sansa's wellbeing, which is something I didn't quite get from her in the books.

1431	Newstar	2013-05-20	I think Tyrion told himself that he wants Sansa. He told Shae he thinks her pretty and he said to Sansa he would do it.He said "I can't" and then quickly corrected that to "I could, but I won't." I'm guessing he wanted to clarify that he was physically capable of doing it (despite being really drunk) and not impotent or anything, but that he wasn't going to.The distinction seems to be an important one, since in the books when Lysa asks whether Tyrion failed to consummate the marriage because he was incapable, Sansa is quick to deny it.Shae noticed the sheets were clean. Would that mean Tywin won't hear immediatelyThis is a good question. In the books, Tyrion believed everyone had found out about the marriage not being consummated through Sansa blabbing to her handmaidens (Cersei's spies). In the show, absent Tyrion or Sansa running off at the mouth, it seems like Shae is the one who would have the power to communicate this information or not. In the post-RW conversation with Tywin in the books, Tywin reminds Tyrion he needs to consummate his marriage. In the show, though, unless Tyrion, Sansa, or Shae spills the beans about the wedding night resulting in non-consummation, how would he know that they hadn't? Even knowing that they were sleeping in separate beds wouldn't necessarily mean anything, as they still could have theoretically consummated the marriage the night of the wedding and continued to sleep apart.I'll be very curious to see if Tywin brings the non-consummation up in 3x10 as something he learned about without Tyrion telling him. (They could deviate the books and have Tywin straight-up ask Tyrion point blank whether or not he's consummated the marriage yet, of course.)And Shae even threatened to another maid in s2 in order to protect Sansa, so she even cares for her.Eh, there are limits to her caring. She knew Loras was gay and didn't say anything. She didn't express one word of outrage or anger to Tyrion on Sansa's behalf in relation to the engagement; it was all about her. And we were reminded in 3x06 that Shae warned Sansa not to trust her.

Or even easier - adding a mention that he took part in Tysha's rape. Etc.That's definitely true of the Tysha story and of Marillion's fingers (although the efficacy of that one in giving an accurate view of Tyrion's dark side is dubious IMO). But the other big instance of Tyrion's morally objectionable acts, the Tommen side plot in ACOK, was likely cut in order to simplify the plot. That whole series of events couldn't be conveyed without a lot more dialogue and time.

He doesn't stop her before she is even undressed. Some of his phrasing in the bedroom may have been a little bit cruder but he was not coarse with her.  I still thought the scene was very good on the show, but IMO Tyrion's "whitewashing" has continued.

1439	Cas Stark	2013-05-20	I thought they did a good job with the wedding scenes, but to say the bedroom wasn't whitewashed is ridiculous.
In the books she takes ALL of her clothes off, he takes ALL of his clothes off, they both get on the bed, its only at the last minute that he changes his mind.
1440	Ser Pounce FTW	2013-05-20	The "one heart, one flesh, one soul, now and forever" sounded rather definite. I wonder if one possible reason for the softening of the marriage is that it may not be quite over yet.I've been thinking the whole way Sansa-Tyrion has been portrayed in the series means that this will be the end game for the two. They may not (ok, probably won't) be a love match but this marriage appears to be permanant.
1441	King Tyrion I	2013-05-20	I thought the whole wedding was great. Both Peter Dinklage and Sophie Turner did a great job, they really made the wedding as awkward as I imagined it was in the books.I like what they're doing with Tyrion. They're showing viewers that even he has flaws, even he has a dark side, but they're not taking it too far. I liked how he was kind and respectufl to Sansa. Like the poster above me said, Tyrion is the leading " good guy " right now./agree.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':agree:' />My thoughts exactly.
1442	wolverine	2013-05-20	I thought they did a good job with the wedding scenes, but to say the bedroom wasn't whitewashed is ridiculous.In the books she takes ALL of her clothes off, he takes ALL of his clothes off, they both get on the bed, its only at the last minute that he changes his mind.With a raging boner and hand on her 12 year old breast.
1443	Minsc	2013-05-20	I've been thinking the whole way Sansa-Tyrion has been portrayed in the series means that this will be the end game for the two. They may not (ok, probably won't) be a love match but this marriage appears to be permanant.I really hope not, as I rather not Sansa be punished by being forced to be stuck in an unhappy marriage with Tyrion.  Moreover, if GRRM attempts to make it "happy" then both that and the take on the Dany/Drogo marriage will make me uncomfortable about how he portrays forced marriages.
1444	wolverine	2013-05-20	Went back to read the book scene and now I only have Dinklage in my head for Tyrion, when he really looks very little like him.  It is weird hearing about his waddle, twisted form, massive scar, and miscolored eyes when my mind says Tyrion looks like Dinklage.
Now I suppose show Tyrion will mess with my head and make me like book Tyrion too.

And if your answer is yes, how much more egregious will her crimes be and will he strangle her?I say no, his father will strangle Shae.  I can't imagine what they could have her do that would really be bad enough for Tyrion Dinklage to be justified in murdering the hooker with the heart of gold who just wants to go to Essos with him and leave the game of thrones and bad people behind.
1448	Minsc	2013-05-20	Like the portrayal pisses you off and that is why or because book Tyrion looks even more like an ass due to show Tyrion being such a shining knight?Generally, the former through the latter might slip in also.Quite frankly, I now fear that Ser Pounce might be right and Sansa might be stuck as only being a reward for Tyrion at the end of the books.
1449	Cybvep	2013-05-20	Or even easier - adding a mention that he took part in Tysha's rape. Etc.I've been wondering whether they will mention that in season 4. For example, during the Tywin-Tyrion confrontation, in order to make it even more dramatic. When you think about it, it's easy to come up with a reason why Tyrion wouldn't want to mention that part of Tysha's story...I agree that Tyrion is a better person in the show, but IMO he was also a very likeable character in the book. The mere fact that he is witty, funny and hilarious makes him very popular. He is one of the fan favourites, after all... Anyway, I think that the writers want Tyrion to cross the moral event horizon during his escape. IMO that this moment may be a nasty shocker for many viewers and may polarize the audience.

And if your answer is yes, how much more egregious will her crimes be and will he strangle her?I thought they were going to make Shae into Fatal Attraction, but it now seems unlikely. Also they are going to have to spark a break in Tyrion and Shae's relationship soon as the next two episodes are RW and fallout and them perhaps a maximum of 4 episodes until Joff's Wedding. They could go for the tragic and show Shae being forced to testify, but Tyrion not knowing that and killing her thinking she's betrayed him, but that just seems too dark, even for BookTyrion.

In contrast, they might be justified in toning down Cersei's darkness in how she has no actual positives that make her likable and sympathetic thus their efforts actually make her a richer character.

I like show Tyrion, but I like book Tyrion even more, because he is more complex /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />.Oh, and BTW, I think that show Cersei is MUCH more interesting than book Cersei. In the books, she resembles a Disney villain. In the show, she is more nuanced. The vast majority of the viewers still hate her, so no problem in that department...

Show Tyrion makes you see what Tyrion could have been! the way they have described him so far, he'll probably *accidentally* trip over the chain he gave her, which will strangle her to death because Tywin put it on to tight, *whoups*

1456	Wouter	2013-05-20	They could go for the tragic and show Shae being forced to testify, but Tyrion not knowing that and killing her thinking she's betrayed him, but that just seems too dark, even for BookTyrion.It would justify a very bitter and dark Tyrion in S5, though. Allthough I guess it's still possible Tywin kills Shae, in spite of the chain gifted by Tyrion last episode.
1457	Cybvep	2013-05-20	Allthough I guess it's still possible Tywin kills Shae, in spite of the chain gifted by Tyrion last episode.That would suxx. I don't mind many of the changes and added scenes, but this is sth which I would never forgive. It's too important for Tyrion's character development.
1458	The Knight of Grasses	2013-05-20	It would be silly to argue against the show making Tyrion more likeable and less complex in the show.  They have, and I can understand why - they want someone in each situation who you can root for.  Tyrion is that guy in King's Landing.  They don't want to risk making him more of a morally questionable character.
Although, to be honest, by this point in the books I really liked Tyrion as well.  I started off disliking him, mostly for being a dick.  But he became much more sympathetic as the books went along.  By the time ASoS rolled around, I was definitely rooting for Tyrion.  In that general sense, I don't see that big of a difference between the show and the books.
As for the relationship between Sansa and Tyrion, I thought they handled it well.  The wedding was awkward enough.  Sansa not kneeling would have come across as pettiness instead of defiance.  We saw a bit of her defiance and displeasure once they got to the bedroom and she asked, "What if I never want to?"  I don't think the character development is quite what it is in the books, but I think that's impossible.  A lot of what began to develop Sansa's character was her inner monologue as she wandered about her "prison."  She didn't really have many people to truly confide in, other than Dontos, who hasn't been a presence in the show the last couple of seasons.  It would be really difficult to bring that across on TV.  I think her character development will catch up once she leaves KL.

It's the only reason I can think of as to why Robb and Cat's storyline has been neglected this entire season.  (On the other hand, I've had quite enough of Talisa. At least book!Jeyne had the decency to stay out of sight most of the time)

He only cares about his happiness?  He's been pretty much the same guy in the show as he was in the books - a kid who is in over his head but is doing the right thing and then makes an enormously critical mistake by letting his hormones take over.  I haven't see anything douchy about him at all, much less complete douchiness.  He's still trying to win a war.I agree that Catelyn has been an after-thought, which is unfortunate, especially since they've spent too much time on needless stuff like Theon torture scenes.  Jon hasn't been written all that well, but I don't think he was written all that well in the books, either.

1466	bobbybuilderton	2013-05-20	I'm more certain than ever Tywin is going to kill Shae when he finds out Tyrion didn't consumate the marriage.Naw man I think Shae is going to show him the sheets. She'll think that she was so clever because it means they can still run away together. Because she shows him, she will escape Tywin's notice. Then she will try to "console" him after Joffrey dies (but really just making sure she is taken care of in case Tyrion dies) and Tyrion will come in after the trial and "IT'S NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE" but choke her out anyway. Welllll maybe not so much those last few sentences. But I do think she will show him the sheets, thinking she is giving Tyrion an out.
1467	silentwanderer	2013-05-20	That's not who Shae is on the show.
She already sees Tywin as the grandfather of her children with Tyrion.
Granted, the grandfather who would murder them in their sleep if he ever finds out about their existance, but grandfather nonetheless.
The calculating social climber we met on the books doesn't exist in the TV show IMO.

Not that much, he gave some traitors to Joff for his "justice" and Book Tyrion was obsessed with getting revenge on Lysa Arryn for his imprisonment, but my opinion is that he really darkens with his marriage to Sansa.
1470	white wolfpack	2013-05-20	Loved how they handled the wedding.  Personally, I don't think Tyrion or Sansa is being portrayed that differently from the books (other than Tyrion's appearance).  They're both a little simplified for TV, but my macro-opinion of both is about the same.
  I hope Tyrion does kill Shae.  To me, that whole storyline in the books was all about how Tyrion is usually a pretty rational adult except when being ordered around by his evil father. When he just basically snapped, I thought it was pretty compelling reading.  I'd love to see them stay close to it. 
My favorite line of the night was Tyrion's, "And now my watch begins."

The whole point of the RW is its huge shock value, hitting people who obviously didn't deserve it. Show Robb's such an idiot many non-readers in various forums are already supsecting he'll be offed or captured by treacherous Freys - of course, they still don't suspect the extent of the massacre of the Northern army.

They say he drinks too much but he only appears drunk at his wedding from what I can remember.  Prostitution hardly seems like a moral dilemma on the show/book/world either.If he wasn't doing the "behind the back scheming" he would be Ned.  It is kind of part of his job when he goes to KL as the hand.I still don't understand why it would be "silly to argue against the show making Tyrion more likable and less complex" though.  It seems like one of the most beloved features of the books is the characters complexity.EDIT:  Those things are a bit morally questionable, but even those items seem very toned down from the book.

1474	Minsc	2013-05-20	Apart from killing Symon what has book!Tyrion done at this point that show!Tyrion hasn't?  I can't remember what exactly makes him so much darker in the books.him admitting his desire to see his family burn in AGOT,how his advice to Jon in AGOT was absolutely terrible and almost got Jon killed,his breaking Marrilion's finger in AGOT,his pleasure in seeing Masha Heddle dead in AGOT,his arming of the Vale Wildmen so they can pillage the Vale in AGOT,dropping his active participation in the Tysha affair,his poisoning of Cersei in ACOK,his burning of smallfolks' homes in ACOK,his declaring he will approve mistreatment of Sansa if Jaime is harmed in ACOKhis handing over the Antler Men to Joffrey in ACOK,his threatening to rape and beat Tommen in ACOK,his actually holding a desire for Sansa and Winterfell when the match is proposed in ASOS,his waiting to the last minute to tell her of the Wedding in ASOS,him making fun of Lollys (a gang rape victim)and in all three books he is pretty abusive to ShaeThat is all stuff that happens before the Wedding.
1475	Zman1863	2013-05-20	Apart from having his child bride fully disrobe and groping her with a hard on before deciding not to have sex with her, you mean?  Not that much, he gave some traitors to Joff for his "justice" and Book Tyrion was obsessed with getting revenge on Lysa Arryn for his imprisonment, but my opinion is that he really darkens with his marriage to Sansa.The Antler Men was a perfectly understandable cut from the show, an unnecessary detail. And anyway, they were guilty of treason, and from what I recall about history, folks in the middle ages weren't particular about the manner of executions. They showed enough of Tyrion's ruthlessness in the Blackwater with the wildfire. It was the equivalent of "going nuclear" or using chemical weapons. He fought dirty. Wanting revenge on Lysa and any of his other captors is pretty understandable considering the charges leveled at him were completely false. Additionally, all that is shown through internal dialogue, which is difficult or impossible to show on screen depending on what thought of the character they are trying to translate. The show had its hands tied to a degree on what they could show in the wedding night scene with Sansa due to the laws of some countries where the show airs. I would have preferred that they had retained more of the dialogue, but I think the essentials about that scene are still there, if not presented as well as possible. He lets her strip to her shift and stops her. That's about as far as they can go with an underage character in some countries I think. I would have preferred him to be less overtly drunk and more clearly tempted. An earlier scene this season with Shae and especially the scene with Bronn in the previous episode built on the idea that Tyrion wants Sansa sexually, but they seemed to have wasted those scenes by making him seem even more reluctant than he was when he blushingly denied to the attraction in the other scenes. gang raped his first loveI do agree that Tyrion's participation in the Tysha rape should not have been cut. It would have been so easy to include a line about how he went last and gave her a gold coin. It shows so many of Tyrion's weaknesses in an instant; that he lusts for women regardless of clear morality issues in play, that he has never been able to refuse his father's commands when it comes down to it, and related to this, that he clings to his material position in the world and as a result has to cling to the vile people he hates most for support. The other major moment that ended up cut was the Tommen Abduction Side Plot from ACOK. That whole charade showed a lot about how Tyrion is at once very much like his father in his ruthlessness but also very conflicted about it, a theme which runs throughout the series in Tyrion's chapters. But those moments would have been much more difficult and time consuming to show, and would have complicated the plot. So I understand why it was cut.
1476	QueenJeyneApproximately	2013-05-20	It would be more poignant if she does see the goodness in Tyrion, but she's still unable to let herself be happy because he's a Lannister, and the Lannisters are basically her captors. Who killed her father. And mother. And brother. If Sansa realised that this union could actually be a happy one for her, in a world where she's to be given away only for her status and value as a "thing", it would make it even more tragic. The one happiness she could have, is also the one she can't allow herself to have. And then she loses it all, anyway. I hope they're going down this road.I think that's how it's portrayed in the book, and it seems to be how they're going to try to do it on the show. In the book, so many of Sansa's more nuanced realizations come after the fact. (For instance, she sees the depth of the Hound's feelings for her, and his potential to be her ally, only after he's gone.) Same with Tyrion. She does come to appreciate him in time, but really only when she's at the Eyrie. In the book, I was rooting for her to see Tyrion's worth---or at least realize he could be a powerful ally---while also knowing that such a realization would be tragic, a great betrayal of the family she's come to value after they are lost. (Again, typical Sansa.) The show can't be as subtle and interior, but I think they will show that Sansa is conflicted, that in one sense she realizes that Tyrion is the best of the lot and that at the same time, she's truly lost if she becomes a Lannister. All in all, I think the show gets at the same feelings, though by different means and at a different pace.
1477	QueenJeyneApproximately	2013-05-20	It would be silly to argue against the show making Tyrion more likeable and less complex in the show.

It would be really difficult to bring that across on TV.  I think her character development will catch up once she leaves KL.I agree. In both the books and the show, he starts off as an amusing but amoral hedonist, then becomes something more complex, then emerges as a hero. A complicated hero, but clearly someone we should root for. THEN the PW and its aftermath, which gives us a darker Tyrion.  (Then he becomes winy, self-pitying, lush Tyrion. Thank god we have a few seasons before that.) Right now, we're riding the crest of sympathetic/underappreciated Tyrion, which seems pretty true at this point in the book as well.

And if your answer is yes, how much more egregious will her crimes be and will he strangle her?I think it will go largely as it went in the books.  She'll testify falsely against him at his trial for murder, probably including a few mocking comments.  And he'll strangle her.I think that's always been an interesting event because in my mind, there is some justice in killing someone who lies to get you sentenced to death.  Yet whether it is justice or not, him doing it to a woman, and to one he loved, is still going to make him look much "darker".  I hope and expect they'll keep it.

1483	Mendoza	2013-05-21	Like the portrayal pisses you off and that is why or because book Tyrion looks even more like an ass due to show Tyrion being such a shining knight?EDIT:  How many people actually think Tyrion will murder Shae on the show?  And if your answer is yes, how much more egregious will her crimes be and will he strangle her?I'm sticking with my theory, no murder of Shae at all, she becomes fake Arya.
1484	Silverin	2013-05-21	The Antler Men was a perfectly understandable cut from the show, an unnecessary detail. And anyway, they were guilty of treason, and from what I recall about history, folks in the middle ages weren't particular about the manner of executions. They showed enough of Tyrion's ruthlessness in the Blackwater with the wildfire. It was the equivalent of "going nuclear" or using chemical weapons. He fought dirty.The Antler Men didn't commit treason by the way. Varys told tyrion that they support Stannis, and tyrion withouth ANY evidence gave them to Joffrey to be ruthlessly executed. Later he learns these men owned huge debt toward the iron Throne that after they death cannot be collected.tyrion was compeletly played by Varys there.It is also worth to mention that tyrion's justice is far worse than he ever recieved from his family during the trial yet he never ever thinks about that he didn't even gave half the chance to these people that he receieved.

1485	Rapsie	2013-05-21	Wanting revenge on Lysa and any of his other captors is pretty understandable considering the charges leveled at him were completely false.  Not completely false, as he was well aware that his brother had tried to kill Bran, hence being an accessory in covering up a crime. He was innocent of involvement, but he did know the truth behind it and also that the Queen was committing high treason.
1486	Mendoza	2013-05-21	I will point out, all these great reminders of the things Tyrion has done in the books "white washed" away, I don't think this one note cornball performance is going to win Peter anymore Emmys. The quality of writing in Kings Landing just isn't here this season. Its just bad filler and pale imitations of the Lannisters. Can you imagine the Emmys playing that scene where he's introducing Pod to the whores? Or the "What's in the Box" scene with the Spider? It'd be a joke. I do think the show went off the rails this season. They thought book 3 was about Tyrion and his man pain over his father, not the tragedy that befell Robb, Cat, and the North. I'm worrying that the Red Wedding is going to be played as some kind of triumph. I wouldn't put it past this show.
1487	Minsc	2013-05-21	I'm sticking with my theory, no murder of Shae at all, she becomes fake Arya.How does Shae pass off as Arya, and how does Theon connect with her?
1488	David Selig	2013-05-21	I'm sticking with my theory, no murder of Shae at all, she becomes fake Arya.Sure, why not, it'd be very easy for her to pass for a 13 years old, she's only about 20 years older, no biggie.

1489	Lemon_Cake	2013-05-21	It is gross in their society also, saying how Viserys criticizes Drogo as being unusual with his desire for 13 year old Dany, who was older then Sansa when she got married.Thus, if Viserys is able to see something as being wrong it is likely the rest of society sees it as being wrong.I agree with this, and actually  we have this quote from GRRM when he says that many husbands would wait for the bride to  turne sixteen or fifteen before having sex , so to me it seems that  13 woud be considerated  by many in Westeros kind of gross.http://www.westeros..../Month/1999/10/
1490	Mendoza	2013-05-21	Sure, why not, it'd be very easy for her to pass for a 13 years old, she's only about 20 years older, no biggie.I never said it'd be a good adaption idea. I just think it's very possible and it gives the show an out to protect Tyrion from murdering her.She'll just be played as an obvious fake no one at the wedding will dare speak out against to the Boltons.
1491	David Selig	2013-05-21	But why the hell the Boltons would choose Shae of all people for this role? Why would Ramsay want to marry a 30+ years prostitute? Why would they pretend she's Arya when absolutely nobody no matter how dim or loyal to them would believe it?
1492	Mendoza	2013-05-21	But why the hell the Boltons would choose Shae of all people for this role? Why would Ramsay want to marry a 30+ years prostitute? Why would they pretend she's Arya when absolutely nobody no matter how dim or loyal to them would believe it?Ok, we're going down the bad fan fic rabbit hole and I certainly don't want to try to adapt this scenario in my head and type it up. There's just apart of me that thinks this show wants Tyrion to remain 'pure', so him murdering her is out of the question. We'll see how it plays out in season 4 and I hope I'm wrong.
1493	HouseLark	2013-05-21	I agree in how that is why Mad Men, Breaking Bad, The Sopranos, Deadwood and Dexter all do so terribly in how TV watchers just won't watch a show with grey or dark characters.Also, might I ask what flaws?edit: Moreover, it seems like many TV fans have been able to enjoy Theon and Jaime both characters that commit violent crimes against children on the show.There's "morally complex" and then there's "borderline paedophile". The Tyrion of the books has feelings for Sansa that, by all conventional definitions, can be interpreted as paedophilic. Now you don't need to start up with "people married young in medieval times, etc, etc", I get all of that and that isn't the point. The point is that there are certain moral lines that we, as members of modern advanced societies, just see as completely repugnant, entirely unable to forgive and understand and taking sexual advantage of children is one of those things. We seem to be able top sympathise with murderers and other criminals but I can't think of a single paedophile in popular culture that is even remotely sympathetic. And that's why the show has chosen to water down Tyrion's feelings for Sansa.Furthermore, there is a huge difference between putting this stuff in a book and on a mass media platform like film or TV. It's the very reason why Lolita is more or less unfilmable in its purest form; as Natalie Portman said when it emerged she turned down the role of Lolita: there doesn't need to be a film (or TV show) out there in which someone has sex with a child. Tyrion doesn't get that far in the books but he's runs it close enough to be extremely uncomfortable. Put that on screen and a lot of people would struggle to ever have any sympathy with Tyrion. Plus, how does a director begin to ask Dinklage and Turner to act that?
1494	Master Forel's Fro	2013-05-21	It's funny people talk more about 13 year old sansa that ALMOST got fucked by tyrion then about Dany married at 13 to a savage that was harsh and Impregnates her at 13. Come on people you're so obsessed with a character that you even get pissed of things that ALMOST happen to them.
1495	Janicia	2013-05-21	The books have a lot of extremes - despicable acts, outlandish costumes (particularly relevant to the Dario discussion), complicated character motivations, unreliable narrator, prophesy, direwolves, ect. 
The show rounds out a lot of those extremes, doesn't go into a lot of those corners.  Beyond budget concerns, I think there is a storytelling aspect to that rounding out.  For one thing, the show doesn't have the kind of time that the book does to rationalize / work through the questionable actions of the various grey characters.  Things (like Dario's hair, Sansa's wedding rebellion, much of LF's machinations) that are tasty seasoning in the books - these things wouldn't have the same flavor in a 10 hour TV series because there wouldn't be any normalcy to dilute them.  
And then there is the aspect of not wanting to put things on TV that are too easily mockable.  Even many book fans, a self selected bunch, find some characters absurd, annoying, or painful to be in their head because they're so evil.  The show is rounding off a lot of those rough edges to end up with a set of people that is more pleasant to spend time with, while still being deeply flawed.
1496	Rapsie	2013-05-21	It's funny people talk more about 13 year old sansa that ALMOST got fucked by tyrion then about Dany married at 13 to a savage that was harsh and Impregnates her at 13. Come on people you're so obsessed with a character that you even get pissed of things that ALMOST happen to them.Most folk are not happy about Drogo / Dany either, but I don't see anyone trying to say Drogo was a 'hero' or a good guy. He was a slaver, murdering, rapist monster and is now dead. If he was still alive and married to Dany, I think it would be a different issue.
1497	MarieAntoinette	2013-05-21	Since this is mainstream TV and not some independent movie I don't think that they had the choice to film Tyrion making sexual advances towards Sansa, especially after she said that line about being fourteen years old. Tyrion could have been interpreted as being a paedophile and I can see why they don't want to go there with one of their main protagonists.
1498	Minsc	2013-05-21	It's funny people talk more about 13 year old sansa that ALMOST got fucked by tyrion then about Dany married at 13 to a savage that was harsh and Impregnates her at 13. Come on people you're so obsessed with a character that you even get pissed of things that ALMOST happen to them.I cheered when Drogo died and I find it extremely creepy that GRRM describes that as a principle love story.
1499	MarieAntoinette	2013-05-21	I thought Dany / Drogon was creepy in the books. I watched the show first and a 13-year old actress paired with the actor of Khal Drogo would have been even more creepy than reading about it.
1500	Master Forel's Fro	2013-05-21	Most folk are not happy about Drogo / Dany either, but I don't see anyone trying to say Drogo was a 'hero' or a good guy. He was a slaver, murdering, rapist monster and is now dead.

1501	Minsc	2013-05-21	I have yet to see any fuss made over Dany as ppl do sansa.Drogo is dead, nor is he ever portrayed as a hero.Tyrion is alive, and is commonly portrayed as a hero.
1502	Rapsie	2013-05-21	I have yet to see any fuss made over Dany as ppl do sansa.It's mainly in the General threads. Also Dany (wrongly IMHO) gets a lot of hate.Drogo is dead, nor is he ever portrayed as a hero.Tyrion is alive, and is commonly portrayed as a hero.Also completely agree.

1503	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2013-05-21	I rewatched the whole wedding and reception over again. I donj't mind sansa not kneeling. In the book she's not giving any warning about it and iirc tyrion and her never have any conversation before the wedding.  in the show she's givin plenty of heads up and her kneeling was kind of a act against joffrey since he took tyrions stool, her not kneeling would have made her look like a dick.
Also don't have a problem with the bedding scene being changed, thinking about it, they probably couldn't have gone through with tyrion getting a hard on and grabbing her boob. Sansa is played by a 17 year old playing a 14 year old and tyrions like 40, so either they would have had to rewrite the scene like they did or get body doubles. and is it just me or was tyrion oogeling a bit when she said she was 14 and when she was undressing?
1504	SeventySeven	2013-05-21	I think that's how it's portrayed in the book, and it seems to be how they're going to try to do it on the show. In the book, so many of Sansa's more nuanced realizations come after the fact. (For instance, she sees the depth of the Hound's feelings for her, and his potential to be her ally, only after he's gone.) Same with Tyrion. She does come to appreciate him in time, but really only when she's at the Eyrie. In the book, I was rooting for her to see Tyrion's worth---or at least realize he could be a powerful ally---while also knowing that such a realization would be tragic, a great betrayal of the family she's come to value after they are lost. (Again, typical Sansa.) The show can't be as subtle and interior, but I think they will show that Sansa is conflicted, that in one sense she realizes that Tyrion is the best of the lot and that at the same time, she's truly lost if she becomes a Lannister. All in all, I think the show gets at the same feelings, though by different means and at a different pace.Yes, mostly that's how it works in the books too, to a degree. I think the show gets this, for the most part.Also don't have a problem with the bedding scene being changed, thinking about it, they probably couldn't have gone through with tyrion getting a hard on and grabbing her boob. Sansa is played by a 17 year old playing a 14 year old and tyrions like 40, so either they would have had to rewrite the scene like they did or get body doubles. and is it just me or was tyrion oogeling a bit when she said she was 14 and when she was undressing?Yes, he let her undressed and she was nearly done and then he stopped her. I think it came across exactly as it should have, only as a tv appropriate version of it. But they made the exact point that was made in the books i.e. Tyrion is attracted to Sansa. I hope that we will see him hoping the marriage would work in time as well.
1505	Runaway Penguin	2013-05-21	I liked the "and so my watch begins" self-mockery. Fitted well.
And the totally drunk Tyrion is probably a nod to things to come... Where wine plays a large part.
1506	Winter's Knight	2013-05-21	Like this blog post about the wedding:http://feministficti...does-not-kneel/But she has one moment of defiance, one moment where she gets to stand up for herself, in an almost insignificant way, and say, <U+0093>I do not consent to this. I will not be part of this.<U+0094> She cannot stop the wedding, but she can refuse to make it easier for anybody. She can be dignified and detached and refuse to participate. And that strength and non-consent was taken away from her. To make her nicer. To make her kinder to Tyrion, and to smooth things over so that we see them both as victims, in this together, with Tyrion<U+0092>s kindness there to save her.To be fair, Tyrion is bold when he defies his father. It<U+0092>s not something that the Lannister siblings do often. It shows decency, both in more-messed-up book Tyrion, and in the nobler, kinder show Tyrion. But why should Sansa need to care about his kindness or his decency? They are both being told to do something that they would rather not do, but Sansa is truly the one in a horrible situation. She is being forced to marry into the family of her enemies. The Lannisters murdered her father, her septa, and everyone from the North in Kings Landing. They have kept her prisoner, away from her family, and threatened her. They are actively trying to kill the little family she has left, and now they are forcing her to become one of them. She may have dreamed of escape, but now she can never escape, because she has become a Lannister. They have completely taken over her identity.And Tyrion may seem kind and promise not to hurt her, but she<U+0092>s heard those words from Lannisters before. She heard them from Cersei, and she heard them from Joffrey, and she learned the hard way that Lannisters lie. Their apparent kindness cannot be trusted. And even if she could trust that Tyrion is genuinely kind (which she cannot), that doesn<U+0092>t change the fact that her marriage is a new kind of prison, and a permanent one at that. It is something that she does not consent to, and she never has to consent to it, no matter how kind Tyrion might be.Her only way to express that, her only moment of clear strength in this story arc, was her refusal to kneel. And in the show, she knelt. She was strong in other ways, in her politeness and her courage and her quiet, terrified dignity, but her one way to fight back was taken away and blurred into niceness.

1507	HouseLark	2013-05-21	I have yet to see any fuss made over Dany as ppl do sansa.Plenty of people have made a fuss over it. I personally hate it and I believe it is badly-written male fantasy wish fulfilment but these arguments have been rehashed over and over in the book sections of the forum and on various websites.Dany has been aged up in the TV show which made her relationship with Drogo slightly more palatable and it was made clear that Drogo raped Dany in the show, which in my view was more realistic than George's "oh, she doesn't want to, but now she likes it, she can't help herself, she's all wet" crap from the books. Still, this caused a lot of controversy in the fandom, many of whom objected to the change in Dany from the reluctant but ultimately willing participant of the books to the victim in the show.Again, read through the book forums and there's plenty of objection to Dany and Drogo.
1508	Ser Pounce FTW	2013-05-21	Since so many feel Sansa was short changed in this scene, this entry by an unsullied might help the situation and show that they get it and things are on track for the character:I kinda loved Sansa this ep. Such guts! Such grace under pressure! She was as strong as Margery - I found her entirely admirable. This is the first time I've realised how much she's growing up. The Sansa we first met was petulant and blurted things out. The Sansa in this episode was kinda amazing.Since Sansa's public stance is that she's a loyal subject while the rest of her family are traitors, she's a ward of the crown and it's as if all her relatives were dead. So, unfortunately, Tywin and Joffrey do have the right to arrange her marriage even though they are also her family's enemies.This is the downside of absolute rule. That's why I gotta love democracy.
1509	eyeheartsansa	2013-05-21	What?  They have added lots of scenes of him being a better guy.  IMO he is far more likeable on the show.  I couldn't stand him in the books, on the show, I don't know how you could dislike him.Umm...in the books he was fondling her naked breasts hard as a rock with her trembling in horror before he realizes it is too awkward (IIRC).  He doesn't stop her before she is even undressed. Some of his phrasing in the bedroom may have been a little bit cruder but he was not coarse with her.  I still thought the scene was very good on the show, but IMO Tyrion's "whitewashing" has continued.Some things are simply not filmable even for HBO.  They are not going to show Sansa stripping for him while he looks down on his sad purple boner.  Maybe they are 'whitewashing' some of the action, but the emotional content is pretty much the same. IMO the things that make Tyrion less likeable happen later in the series.
1510	Ghost of Snow	2013-05-21	Personally, I find the chances HBo made reasonable. First of all, let's talk about the bedding scene. Sansa is played by a 17 years old girl and she's supposed to be 14 in the show canon. I'm not sure if the law allows a minor to be naked on scene, but it would be awkard to see a teenage girl in an almost sex scene with a 40+ man.. Moving on, I also find reasonable that they make her to kneel. In the books, Sansa was informed about her wedding the same day she was about to be married and this. That was a big shock for her who was imagining to go and live in Highgarden away from the Lannisters. But Lannisters had to smash her dream and on top of that make her wed one of their kin. Of course, she wouldn't try to make the wedding easier for Tyrion (or any Lannister in general). However, on the show she already knows about it a while now. She recieved Margaery's advice on the subject and she had the time to deal with this wedding. Furthermore, Tyrion was the one who assured her that he wouldn't harmed her and he even made her smile on the actual day of her wedding. I don't see why she should be mean to be in the show. By having her not kneeling would make her a big meanie and also supportive of Joffrey's bad joke and that's not the message the book gave. Instead of worrying about the actual act of  Sansa  kneeling I think that we should complain about the series of events that lead to it (Margaery's out of -book- character advice, Sansa knowing about her wedding days ago etc..)
1511	Dark_Sister	2013-05-21	^^ It is completely illegal to film a nude scene with a minor, and I think it's also illegal to film a nude scene with an underage character even if the actor/actress is of age, I always assumed they were going to do exactly what they did, and honestly I prefer it. The scene managed to transmit how they both felt, that's what matters.
Personally, I think their relationship will be like in the books, it's obvious they don't have anything in common, and after the RW I think Sansa will be really depressed and it will kill any chance they have of getting along.

1512	mrs_serpounce	2013-05-21	Apart from having his child bride fully disrobe and groping her with a hard on before deciding not to have sex with her, you mean? There are actually nudity laws for broadcast regarding underage actors (Sophie is 17, so she still qualifies) and regarding erect male genetalia (you can show it flaccid, but not erect, don't ask me why). Thus, why you have a "whitewashed" bedroom scene.

Add in the whole "no raging hard-ons allowed because X-RATED yanno" and you have why the scene was edited.. /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />
1514	Lady Sansa Stark	2013-05-21	I was very much looking forward to this wedding, and I was afraid ''they'' wouldn't do it ''the right way'' since Sansa is my favourite character and I have a tendency to dislike ''big'' changes from the books. Emphasize the ''''.  And I have to say, I'm pretty happy with how they dealt with it. One could easily see Sansa didn't want it, and one cannot but feel sorry for her while watching the episode. Well, I couldn't. Her pain was visible, the awkwardness was visible, the whole sham that the wedding was, was portrayed really well. Especially with drunk Tyrion, humiliating Sansa in the process.
Joffrey's threat served as a reminder that she was still very much a prisoner, which was also pointed out by Tyrion himself. The kneeling, well, I'd rather have that they handled the scene a bit different, since her not kneeling was quite important in the books, but after he asked her to kneel, she couldn't do anything else; and the awkwardness was already made clear, as well as her refusal of accepting the marriage. 
Now, I really don't want the show going all ''Sansa accepts and likes Tyrion and being all conflicted about it, ''because Tyrion is nice to her''. What I got from the books (and this is different for everyone of course), she accepted that Tyrion was kind to her on multiple occasions, but that was about it. She did not accept the marriage as a whole, she did not accept Tyrion as her husband, and completely shuts him out, as well as any other. She does not really like him for being kind to her. He's a Lannister, he's the ugliest guy she could imagine and she would be stuck with him forever. He'd protect her as good as he could, yes, but Joffrey was still King and she knew it.
And then the things I read yesterday, about how Sansa was a shallow little girl (and worse things) for not liking Tyrion Lannister (more like Peter Dinklage I think) ... No matter his "good personality" or the fact that she "shouldn't mind" his dwarfism or ugliness because he was kind to her, it just shouldn't be criteria for her to like him or even love him. The fact that some people do think these are good criteria for loving him and wanting him in her bed... I mean, really? As if I should feel happy as a 13-year-old when Tyrion Lannister is going to be my husband because he is "kind" while others are not. Doesn't mean I should instantly, or eventually like/love him and be rejoiced. Love cannot be forced, and "kindness" should not be used as a reason for Sansa wanting him in her bed.  Please. I've read this so many times (yesterday included after people saw the episode), and every time it still astonishes me.
1515	wandering	2013-05-21	What's this whitewashing nonsense people are going on about? Tyrion is grey in the show FFS. Did you not hear the connotation in his voice when he tells Sansa that his father "has demanded" he bed her? He clearly wanted Sansa in that moment.

I don't think the wedding scene portrayed him as a "hero" at all, or Sansa as a "bitch." I think it was portrayed in the spirit of the book - awkward and painful for all involved in many, many ways.

I've seen so many posts calling sansa a bitch on tumblr now I don't even know why I bother to search the ASOIAF tags on that website.As with the books. Many readers like Tyrion. Many viewers like Tyrion. Many readers think Sansa was spiteful toward Tyrion. Not nearly as many viewers thing she was. While Tyrion has definitely been "freed" from some of his evil deeds, so has Sansa and I believe it was in an attempt to make both more likeable. In the end, the wedding and bedding scene was done well for the medium. Without the benefit of Sansa's thoughts, her actions would have been viewed very negatively.
1523	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-21	I'm utterly bemused that some people think, no matter how a whole bunch of us are still saying that we don't consider Show!Tyrion a hero or anything *but* a grey character, that we're being "smug".Please point out posts here to me that find him "more endearing," because personally, I think that the entire wedding was a good shadow of his book counterpart, from him being the "god of tits and wine" to stabbing the table and threatening Joff to staggering into their bedroom to the reluctance in his tone as he told her to stop.Amazing how the "whitewashing" posts forget these things. I don't think the wedding scene portrayed him as a "hero" at all, or Sansa as a "bitch." I think it was portrayed in the spirit of the book - awkward and painful for all involved in many, many ways.ok /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />All taken from tumblr I<U+0080><U+0099>m watching Second Sons and its making me so sad because Tyrion is trying his best to be kind and Sansa<U+0080><U+0099>s not being tactful or thoughtful at all T^TSANSA! as much as i love you you little darling, if you could just get over yourself a little bit, you and tyrion would MAKE A GREAT FUCKING TEAM!Awww Tyrion Lannister is so cute when he<U+0080><U+0099>s drunk. I just wanna hold the lil fellaWow, if it wasn<U+0080><U+0099>t already high enough, my respect for Tyrion only grew during this latest episode of <U+0080>Game of Thrones<U+0080><U+0099>. He tried to make the most out of his situation with Sansa. He even tried to make her feel better by laughing, even though he wanted to be with someone else himself. Oh, and the fact that he didn<U+0080><U+0099>t rape her also set off my feels for him.I<U+0080><U+0099>m sorry but the way Tyrion<U+0080><U+0099>s face just falls when Sansa says that she might never want him. it's all poor tyrion and inconsiderate sansaI KNOW that you and a lot of people who have read the books still see Tyrion as grey, my point is, the way he is on the show, he is made to be endearing and poor tyrion and wow isn't he nice and a lot of people who haven't read the books are viewing him like this. he IS whitewashed, regardless of whether your opinion on tyrion has changed or not.
1524	silentwanderer	2013-05-21	But why the hell the Boltons would choose Shae of all people for this role? Why would Ramsay want to marry a 30+ years prostitute? Why would they pretend she's Arya when absolutely nobody no matter how dim or loyal to them would believe it?My theory is that  Bolton & Ramsay will use the real Arya because of the timeline set by the show,.Seems pretty easy to caught a faceless-girl-in-training if she loses focus in her own home. Since the Bolton are supposed to take Winterfell a few seasons from now, Arya could end up about to marry the bastard for real this time.Arya could still spend a few seasons in Braavos until then and Ramsay a few seasons turturing Theon.

Robb and Jon could have fit the role, but the both are making big mistakes so far: Robb screwed up his alliances because of a woman and Jon  broke his vows (also, his role hasn't been that important this season). TV shows work like this, they need a "main character" people could relate to and Tyrion fits the role. We know Robb will be gone very soon too, so Tyrion is the one left for the next season, even after he's accused of murder, people will support him because that's how I guess D/D want the audience to see the character. Until the moment when he breaks down and commits a double murder. That will come as a real shock, considering that he has been protected from gray situations, and he went straight to black.ETA: Tumblr is a good way to measure extreme and radical fans. They either love or hate something or someone, but they aren't objective.

1530	Raksha the Demon	2013-05-21	I was very much looking forward to this wedding, and I was afraid ''they'' wouldn't do it ''the right way'' since Sansa is my favourite character and I have a tendency to dislike ''big'' changes from the books. Emphasize the ''''.  And I have to say, I'm pretty happy with how they dealt with it. One could easily see Sansa didn't want it, and one cannot but feel sorry for her while watching the episode. Well, I couldn't. Her pain was visible, the awkwardness was visible, the whole sham that the wedding was, was portrayed really well. Especially with drunk Tyrion, humiliating Sansa in the process.Joffrey's threat served as a reminder that she was still very much a prisoner, which was also pointed out by Tyrion himself. The kneeling, well, I'd rather have that they handled the scene a bit different, since her not kneeling was quite important in the books, but after he asked her to kneel, she couldn't do anything else; and the awkwardness was already made clear, as well as her refusal of accepting the marriage.Now, I really don't want the show going all ''Sansa accepts and likes Tyrion and being all conflicted about it, ''because Tyrion is nice to her''. What I got from the books (and this is different for everyone of course), she accepted that Tyrion was kind to her on multiple occasions, but that was about it. She did not accept the marriage as a whole, she did not accept Tyrion as her husband, and completely shuts him out, as well as any other. She does not really like him for being kind to her. He's a Lannister, he's the ugliest guy she could imagine and she would be stuck with him forever. He'd protect her as good as he could, yes, but Joffrey was still King and she knew it.And then the things I read yesterday, about how Sansa was a shallow little girl (and worse things) for not liking Tyrion Lannister (more like Peter Dinklage I think) ... No matter his "good personality" or the fact that she "shouldn't mind" his dwarfism or ugliness because he was kind to her, it just shouldn't be criteria for her to like him or even love him. The fact that some people do think these are good criteria for loving him and wanting him in her bed... I mean, really? As if I should feel happy as a 13-year-old when Tyrion Lannister is going to be my husband because he is "kind" while others are not. Doesn't mean I should instantly, or eventually like/love him and be rejoiced. Love cannot be forced, and "kindness" should not be used as a reason for Sansa wanting him in her bed.  Please. I've read this so many times (yesterday included after people saw the episode), and every time it still astonishes me.I thought the wedding/bedroom scene could have, on the whole, been far worse.  I half expected Tyrion to be whitewashed far more and behave like a real 'parfit gentil knight', rather than putting his foot in his mouth with his nervous bride-to-be by telling her he knows how she feels (i.e. thinking that because he was ordered to marry her as she was ordered to marry him, they're suffering equally, when he still has a father and siblings, he is not a captive of the family that destroyed his own and is not now facing the obliteration of his own family identity by forced marriage) and then getting repulsively drunk during the wedding feast.  And I thought that smile of Tyrion's, after Sansa asks 'and what if I never want you to...?', was perfect book-Tyrion, accepting, but with a savage sarcasm showing, however brief.  TV-Sansa showed her nervousness and misery with small gestures and posture.  She looked like a sacrificial offering on her way to her death rather than a bride walking towards her groom when she entered the sept in her finery.  She threw out a few nervous half-smiles at the court, because it was expected of her and people were actually smiling at her; but she looked vulnerable and unhappy.  (of course, that rather ugly wedding dress and horrible hairdo didn't help) And Sansa's behavior in the bedroom, when Tyrion tells her that his father has ordered him to consummate the marriage; from her standing there twisting her hands awkwardly to her then mechanically and joylessly starting to strip, was in character for the TV version.  The biggest obstacle in the way of Sansa ever becoming anything close to a loving, or even content wife of Tyrion Lannister is not, in my opinion, his dwarfism.  It's the lack of trust.  Sansa has been hurt so badly by Tyrion's family that she cannot bring herself to trust him, even when he is kind to her.  I seem to recall (don't have the book handy) in ACOK, when Tyrion rescued her from the beating and had her brought to his tower and treated and he talked to her, that Sansa was almost tempted to let down her courtesy armor with him, but reminded herself that Joffrey and Cersei had once been kind to her as well, or something like that.  Sansa made a huge mistake in trusting the Lannisters more than once in GOT, and she cannot forget it; and she is hugely wary of anyone in that family, even the best of them.  (of course, it's not easy to tell, when one is 11-14, who is trustworthy and who isn't; and even Sansa's own father made a fatal mistake in trusting Littlefinger, and he was old enough to know better)

1534	Harnisfechten	2013-05-21	I hate the whitewashing of Tyrion. The show has turned him into a heroic protagonist (rather than a more grey protagonist like Jaime). The fact that people feel bad for him and think Sansa is wrong for not wanting him is proof that the show got it wrong.

They're "obsessions" about show, books or movies are mostly their own projection on the characters ("Draco in Leather pants" is a trope that fits what I'm saying) or a projection of their own ideas and conflicts.

1539	Lady Lea	2013-05-21	I have stated in other places that I'm fairly certain Podrick Payne:Sex God is an attempt to make him chasing after Tyrion more believable. They wanted to build that relationship that they have more. That's how I get past it anyway. Dunno how true it is.That was probably just a product of the writers' brilliant minds who realised that if you change the R in Podrick you get PRO DICK.If this sounds like something a 12 year boy thought of, then it sounds like something the GOT writers would think of and laugh hysterically at.
1540	Maizel	2013-05-21	I think the whitewashing is to get a starker contrast with the post SOS Tyrion.
The wedding scene was great. Best scene of the episode imo. .

1545	I'll pay the iron price	2013-05-21	As much as I love Tyrion and hate Joffrey, I had to chuckle when Joff knicked the stool provided for Tyrion to put the cloak on Sansa
1546	NedStark2013	2013-05-21	His comment to Joffrey about his Wooden Parts was one of the best lines in the histroy that was Game Of Thrones.
1547	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-21	I'm utterly bemused that some people think, no matter how a whole bunch of us are still saying that we don't consider Show!Tyrion a hero or anything *but* a grey character, that we're being "smug".The context has just been completely lost.  Tyrion is not a paragon of virtue because he's a product of his society. Westeros is a pretty brutal place, where things that would be intolerable here are fairly well accepted there.  Cruelty during war, swift justice/revenge for perceived slights, etc..  There are a great many ways in which Tyrion does not rise above this setting.  The common listing of his sins -- Marillion's fingers, etc. -- don't seem to many to be outside the norm of what other Westerosi would see as something to be expected in those particular circumstancesHowever, I think most fans accept those cultural norms as the baseline for judging characters.  We praise characters who rise above them, and condemn those who are even worse.  Tyrion has most of the flaws common to Westerosi nobility, so those flaws are unremarkable.  Literally -- it's not really worthy of remarking on them because that's understood as the baseline of the world the author created.  So it's not that Tyrion is perfect.  It's that his flaws are unremarkable in the context of the setting.Tyrion deservedly gets sympathy right off the bat because of the abuse heaped on him simply because of what he is -- a dwarf.  He gets treated like the only black guy in a world full of racists.  Sure, his money can buy him temporary friends and pleasures, but he is prejudged virtually everywhere he goes, and has been considered defective and twisted from birth, openly mocked in social settings, simply because of an accident of birth.  People who don't even know him hate him, and deride him as "the Imp".  And that's completely overlooking the abuse at the hands of his father and sister, and the twisted Lannister morality in which he was raised that devalued everyone who wasn't a Lannister.Given that treatment, from virtually all of his peers, the fact that he has retained his humanity and, in many instances, risen above the standards of the day, is remarkable.  The fact that he has retained a sense of humor is remarkable.  Fans like him because of his positive qualities that have been listed previously, in particular his demonstrated concern for people to whom he owes nothing.  Bran, Jon, etc..  When no other member of Westerosi nobility would stand up for Sansa, Tyrion did, though he had absolutely nothing to gain by it.   When he had every legal right to take Sansa's maidenhead, secure the marriage, and set himself up as a future Lord of Winterfell, and when his peers expected him to do exactly that -- he didn't.  Even though he actually had physical urges to do that, he resisted them and stopped.  Simply because he thought it was a wrong thing to do to her, regardless of what the rest of the Court thought.That does not make him anything close to perfect.  But it does make him someone with some very admirable qualities.

I hope that if I ever make it to the numerous number of posts you have under your belt, I'll be half as such /thumbsup.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':thumbsup:' />
1549	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-21	Since this is mainstream TV and not some independent movie I don't think that they had the choice to film Tyrion making sexual advances towards Sansa, especially after she said that line about being fourteen years old. Tyrion could have been interpreted as being a paedophile and I can see why they don't want to go there with one of their main protagonists.Sansa's reaction when she had her first period demonstrates that she understood perfectly the Westerosi norms regarding the age for bedding.  Whatever our lines are, they are simply not the same in either Westeros or Essos.But it is much easier to immerse yourself in a culture in a book than it is in a show that you only watch for one hour each week.  Portraying visually a 12 or 14 year old being groped, or having sex, is not something even many fans would like to see.  Nor is it the type of headline the showrunners wanted to have, because viewers and potential viewers who had not read the books, and who were not well-versed in historical precedent for marrying young, could have been very alienated/offended.That's why D&D made changes to every relationship involving minors and sex.  Danys is made much older.  Robb and Jane/Talisa are made much older, etc..  Not showing Tyrion groping a 14 year old wasn't whitewashing Tyrion -- it was part of a uniformly-applied decision not to show sexual activities with characters presented as minors.  For what should be quite understandable reasons.ETA:  I should point out that the author himself freely admits that Tyrion is his favorite character.  He is written to be imperfect, which flaws and a level of cruelty common to the time.  But I don't think, by any stretch, that he would consider Tyrion's actions towards Sansa to be on the level of creepy paedophilia, something which I'm sure he loathes.  He knows his history, and knows that brides were occassionally married/bedded that young, without the husbands being viewed the way we would view such actions in present times.

I hope that if I ever make it to the numerous number of posts you have under your belt, I'll be half as such /thumbsup.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':thumbsup:' />Oh hell, don't sell yourself short -- you've been doing quite fine on your own.
1551	Minsc	2013-05-21	-snip-Hey, another post about how Tyrion is great when we look at him by the standards of Westeros thus his negative actions are not actually negative. Yet, for some reason it talk about Tyrion suffering abuse when by Westeros standards he hasn't been treated overly negative instead he is treated much better then the average dwarf.Either we judge him for his following the negatives of his society or we don't feel sorry for him as he suffers the negatives of his society.Especially, one has to love how this standard only seems to be fitted on Tyrion in how no one argues Tywin and Cersei were justified in hating the deformed dwarf that killed their beloved wife/mother because that would be a reasonable stance with Westeros.With Ned Stark gone, there is no "hero" left in the show. Robb and Jon could have fit the role, but the both are making big mistakes so far: Robb screwed up his alliances because of a woman and Jon  broke his vows (also, his role hasn't been that important this season). TV shows work like this, they need a "main character" people could relate to and Tyrion fits the role. We know Robb will be gone very soon too, so Tyrion is the one left for the next season, even after he's accused of murder, people will support him because that's how I guess D/D want the audience to see the character. Until the moment when he breaks down and commits a double murder. That will come as a real shock, considering that he has been protected from gray situations, and he went straight to black.When their whitewashing negatively influences another character's story the excuse they need a hero doesn't fly.  Especially, when they feel the need to make many of the more light grey characters look worse(Robb, Blackfish) or if they just decide to just ignore them entirely (Catelyn, Jon).Moreover, if they were so worried about the need for unambiguously good hero for their series they shouldn't agree to adapt a series known for its grey characters.

1552	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-21	Hey, another post about how Tyrion is great when we look at him by the standards of Westeros thus his negative actions are not actually negative.Well, when discussing George Washington, how necessary is it to repeatedly mention that he owned slaves?  We get it, just as we get that breaking someone's fingers is not nice.Yet, for some reason it talk about Tyrion suffering abuse when by Westeros standards he hasn't been treated overly negative instead he is treated much better then the average dwarf.This is nonsensical.  To go back to George Washington owning slaves, just because we might judge Washington in the context of his times regarding slavery doesn't mean it sucked any less to be a slave.Either we judge him for his following the negatives of his society or we don't feel sorry for him as he suffers the negatives of his society.How commonly accepted something is has absolutely nothing to do with the suffering felt by the victim.

1554	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-21	Oh, and as to Sansa....Sansa is subject to criticisms that are incredibly mild given what else is going on.  Yes, she's naive, self-centered, and early on, a pretty nasty little bitch.On the other hand, those flaws aren't even on the same scale as the other things we talk about in Westeros.  Sansa is, in many ways, no different from a naive, self-centered, sometimes bitchy 13 year old girl in our own times.  She is not a murderer, torturer, rapist, or anything like the level of horrible we see from so many other characters.  Her "sins" are normal 13 year old girl sins, and the criticisms are the same ones we might utter about a girl in our own times.  There's no sense, ever, that she would ever be deliberately cruel regarding anything of significance to any other person.  Maybe she'd develop into such a person, but she's not one now.For some reason, though, many folks who seem to take criticism of Sansa so very personally for some unfathomable reasons, object even to these mild criticisms of her personality, as if she is somehow being truly demonized.  It is bizarre.
1555	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-21	And yet you diminish the sufferings that Tyrion inflicts on his victims because well his actions fit with the times.No, I don't.  You are remarkably consistent at lacking comprehension, so you've got that going for you.The sufferings are not diminished.   It is the guilt that we attach to them that changes.

It is the guilt that we attach to them that changes.Arguing that we shouldn't judge him negatively for his actions diminish them, just like saying Tywin was pretty good father to Tyrion in comparison to the standards of Westeros diminishes Tyrion's suffering by him.

I mean we're still talking about the guy that had his one of his sons tell his other son that his wife was a whore, then had said wife gang raped by a bunch of soldiers, before forcing his son to join in. Even by Westerosi standards Tywin's not quite deserving of a "best dad in Westeros" mug or anything.
1558	HouseHarrison	2013-05-21	I think the whitewashing is to get a starker contrast with the post SOS Tyrion.The wedding scene was great. Best scene of the episode imo. .This imo. The writers get the overall ASOIF story, plus right now Dinklage is their frontrunner. Post-ASOS they'll likely abandon the whitewashing.I honestly find a starker contrast more tragic for the character. Tyrion already being a bit of a sleezeball into a little worse of a sleezeball isn't proportionate with his whining and inner monologues about being dead inside or etc..
1559	aedalia	2013-05-21	I've only watched it once, but I think they covered off Sansa's initial refusal to kneel quite well- on her way up the stairs, she saw the stool, I don't think she saw Joff carry it away.
I mean, I like her little act of defiance in the book, but it wouldn't work with the changes on screen, so it's a good compromise.

Thus, by looking at it through Westeros standards Tywin's actions aren't that terrible.  Moreover, Tywin not killing Tyrion at birth is just as noble as Tyrion not raping Sansa on their wedding night. Thus, if we excuse Tyrion for his actions because of Westeros standards then once must do the same for Tywin.

And Tywin's rant about how he despises Tyrion, right to his face, is going to be insulting in any culture.In any case, Tywin's ill deeds go quite beyond his fatherhood skills.  Sacking KL, for example, was treachery.  How the Targaryen family was treated, even if politically prudent, was beyond what was necessary.  (book only...the Brave Companions are seen as beyond what's appropriate, even in war, and that bites Tywin via Jamie) The Mountain, generally, is beyond what is acceptable.  I would argue his "letters" accrue some worse-than-acceptable guilt to him too in how he winds down the Northern rebellion.I'm not sure that a Westerosi father has an inherent legal right to kill his children at birth, is that written?  It clearly does not continue, as Randyll Tarly's threat to Sam is "off the books."
1562	juanml82	2013-05-21	Gang raping commoners in peace time doesn't seem to be standard procedure for Westerosi nobles. Not that they are kind to the small folk - most aren't. But even their loose morals are just a bit higher than that.
1563	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-21	Arguing that we shouldn't judge him negatively for his actions diminish them....First, I've never said he shouldn't be judged negatively.  It's a mitigating factor that lessens guilt, not necessarily eliminating it.  Although it might depending upon the specific conduct at issue.Second, you apparently believe there is a binding correlation between the moral guilt of the actor, and the level of suffering of the victim.  I don't believe that, and honestly think it is a ridiculous argument.  So we really don't have a basis for further discussion on that point....just like saying Tywin was pretty good father to Tyrion in comparison to the standards of Westeros....Please quit assigning to me statements I never made.  I do not believe, remotely, that Tywin was a good father to Tyrion under the standards of Westeros.  In fact, I think he was a shitty father.  WIthout getting too far off on this tangent, I do not believe that Tywin's hatred of Tyrion was primarily due to Tyrion being a dwarf.  It was due primarily to Tywin's completely unjustified blaming of an innocent baby for the death of his wife in childbirth.  Nor do I believe that most other Westerosi nobility would have displayed the same level of wanton cruelty to a deformed son that Tywin did.ETA:  I should add this.  While I do believe that we should judge those who commit wrong acts in the context of their time, that does not delegitimize the actions of those who seek to resist those wrong acts.  I hate slavery, but I don't think Washington was a horrible guy just because he owned slaves.  On the other hand, I would not judge a slave who rebelled and killed him as committing a wrongful act.

Thus, by looking at it through Westeros standards Tywin's actions aren't that terrible. Says you.  I do not think that a lot of Westerosi nobility would have treated the commoner the way Tywin did.Moreover, Tywin not killing Tyrion at birth is just as noble as Tyrion not raping Sansa on their wedding night.Again, I disagree, as I've stated before.

And Tywin's rant about how he despises Tyrion, right to his face, is going to be insulting in any culture.No one seems to challenge Tywin's actions, nor are they different then what Balon did when he choose Asha to be his heir rather then Theon and decided to bad mouth Theon to his face which wasn't faced with reproach by either Vic or Damphair.  Thus, that hardly seems like something that horribly terrible in Westeros society.I'm not sure that a Westerosi father has an inherent legal right to kill his children at birth, is that written?  It clearly does not continue, as Randyll Tarly's threat to Sam is "off the books."Tywin could have just abandoned baby Tyrion in the same manner that many Westeros parents do to their dwarf children, moreover he could have refused to support or provide any substance to the older Tyrion.  In yet, Tyrion never suffered from a want of gold or a position in society with Tywin providing him numerous positions at the Rock or KL.Please quit assigning to me statements I never made.  I do not believe, remotely, that Tywin was a good father to Tyrion under the standards of Westeros.  In fact, I think he was a shitty father.

In how, quite frankly despite his hatred for Tyrion and his drastic punishments when he stepped out of the respectable line Tywin always provided and protected Tyrion much like a father in Westeros is obligated to do.

It isn't personal, just a character with flaws like the hundreds of others Martin created.But Tywin has NO grounds by Westerosi law to bar Tyrion from inheriting Casterly Rock.  This is correct and Martin has stated that Tywin was deluding himself to think that he could do so.

1569	Mendoza	2013-05-21	As long as they don't make something stupid like Sansa falling in love with Tyrion, and then at the Vale thinking romantically about him...blegh!Sophie Turner did an interview after this episode and said she thought the only way Sansa could fall in love with Tyrion would be a false love.The show was overplayed Littlefinger to keep him in the mix as force, sometimes resulting in mustache twirling, but at least that gives me hope the focus at the Vale in season 5 will be on his schemes and not bad Disney musical montages of Sansa longing for her heroic husband. Barf.

And yet she didn't kneel spontaneously, allthough she did. You pretty much have to freeze the frame to see Sansa noticing what Joffrey is doing.
1573	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-21	No one seems to challenge Tywin's actions...Gee, I wonder why that would be?In any case, the question of who actually inherits Casterly Rock would only be answered after Twyin has died, so in legal terms, Tywin's statement that Tyrion would never inherit the Rock was not "ripe" to be challenged at that time anyway.Tywin could have just abandoned baby Tyrion in the same manner that many Westeros parents do to their dwarf children....No, he couldn't have, because he wasn't in the same position as average Westerosi parents.   There's no evidence at all that noble-born dwarfs are abandoned, and Tyrion is thankful he was born into the nobility, not that he was born particularly to the kind-hearted Tywin.  So the way I see it, it's likely an economic decision to abandon dwarf children, not some kind of "kill the monster" morality.Commoners who live hand-to-mouth, and can barely afford the children they have, may decide they simply cannot afford to feed/house/clothe a child who is likely never going to be able to contribute meaningfully on farm, and may be a burden his/her entire life.  They are abandoned because the family cannot afford the burden.What would be Tywin's justification?  He's got unlimited funds, so there's no possible reason he can't afford to raise a dwarf child.   Nor I don't see Tywin's motives as being anything worthy of praise either.  Tywin obsesses over the family name.  Not because he loves his relatives, but because the power of the Lannister name is his power as well.  If you wrong a Lannister, or show a lack of respect, it weakens the House, and that is something Tywin will not tolerate.  Tossing out a Lannister baby, as if you were unable to support it, would undo all that emphasis on what it means to be a Lannister, because he'll have just shown that some Lannisters really aren't worthy of protection.So no.  I give Tywin zero points for not abandoning Tyrion, or for funding his adulthood, because neither has anything to do with a praiseworthy sense of morality or compassion.  It's really just another example of human beings having no value to him unless their name matches his.I am not saying that "you" have said that I saying an objective look at your statements says that.Really?  Please find me such statements.  Please.  I have actually previously made a statement rejecting the exact implication you are abscribing to me here, by pointing out that there does not seem to be any evidence that the nobility ever treat dwarf children the same as some commoners might.

In yet, Tyrion never suffered from a want of gold or a position in society with Tywin providing him numerous positions at the Rock or KL.Where is it established that Westerosi abandon their dwarf children to die? That's not even a medieval thing. That's a Spartan cultural thing. In medieval times, dwarfs were considered to be relatively lucky. They were silly and ridiculous, but they didnt have to struggle to survive. They always had a role as a fool or jester and a symbol of wealth and luck. That's relatively fortunate for the times. Where are you getting that they were typically put to death?Tywin wouldn't want to have a silly or foolish son, so that much falls within typical european dwarf history. Tywin also went through a life-changing loss of his wife through childbirth. That doesn't mean that he puts his son to death. What it does is somewhat justify Tywin's contempt of his son.Have you made any reasonable explanation as to what you're talking about? So far I just see you ranting and raving about one thing after another, and it just seems ridiculous.

1576	wolverine	2013-05-21	Quick PS: I watch GoT with four Unsullied. They view Tyrion on the same gray level I do; while they are endeared to him because he's witty and entertaining, it's definitely not "wow, isn't he nice." They think he's pretty dangerous.I'd actually love to see a poll of Unsullied to see where that skews.I watch with two non-book readers, a husband and wife about 36, they both think Tyrion is a hero and completely great guy.  They don't think Sansa should want to be with him, but they do not see him as grey at all.EDIT:  As far as whitewashing, I think there have been plenty of book scenes (which have already been pointed out) that have been altered/added to the show, for whatever reason, making Tyrion look like a "better guy." Where as, I have not seen any examples of a scene being altered to make Tyrion look like a "worse guy."Many of the changes are very small, but when they are all added up his fundamental character is changed IMO.  One such scene I have not seen mentioned yet, is that Tyrion gets to be the one giving vital advice to Jon on how to make friends when he first gets to the wall instead of the blacksmith.I really liked the wedding scene as done on the show, but that doesn't change my opinion that the whole sequence of scenes made Tyrion look like a better guy.

1579	chris999	2013-05-21	I'm a little nervous to actually start this thread myself, but here goes!What does everyone think about the Tyrion/Sansa dynamic going on? Clearly this continues Tyrion's "whitewashing" but I, personally, find this a bit enjoyable. We got to see Tyrion's lush side for the first time in ages, and it reminds us that he is NOT perfect. It also reinforces that he is not willing to hurt or use Sansa and that he is afraid of his father.There was so much going on during the wedding scene. I think it was brilliantly done, even if it didn't adhere completely to canon.I think the scene was pretty good too, but as much as I hate to say it, I saw Sansa smiling and enoying herself for most of the night, when my memory of the books is that she was terrified all night long.I didnt feel the painful emotions from either character that I sensed from the books. But I am nitpicking, and the scene was good anyway.
1580	Raksha the Demon	2013-05-21	I'm pretty sure Sansa did see that Joffrey carried it away - she turned her head and watched with what seemed to be a somewhat puzzled expression. And yet she didn't kneel spontaneously, allthough she did. You pretty much have to freeze the frame to see Sansa noticing what Joffrey is doing.Watching TV-Sansa during the wedding ceremony and afterwards gave me the impression of a girl trying not to collapse in a state of mingled shock and despair.  She looks like she's fighting to keep, metaphorically, her head above water.  I wasn't sure whether she was even aware the chair had been pulled, or even clearly understanding the septon's words indicating that it was time for Tyrion to put the cloak of his protection over her.  I know that when I have been in certain situations that, while not unpleasant or anywhere near the level of misery and reluctance that Sansa experienced during the wedding ceremony, were stressful and involved something I was not very good at (and knew it), I mentally seemed to tune out a lot that was going on around me.  TV-Sansa seemed to be fogged like that, at least for a few moments before the Septon; rather than making a deliberate decision to defy the Lannisters by refusing to kneel; as opposed to Sansa in the books. It was a good, well-acted, and tragic scene.
1581	Raksha the Demon	2013-05-21	Facebook, then? YouTube? I mean, no one is objective, and neither are Tumblr fans, but no one can deny that there are a lot of people who praise Tyrion for what he did and didn't do, while being angry with Sansa for what she did and didn't do. And others cannot understand that /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />http://25.media.tumb...m91uno1_500.jpgThis is a great picture (referencing it from other posts, but hadn't included the URL) - Sansa is like, OMG, I've married a Lannister dwarf, she's in shock, and Tyrion is drunk and seems to be admiring his scar.

Yeah, people can zone out at weddings when they're getting married under the best of circumstances, because like a lot of public ceremonies performed in front of large groups of people, weddings can be stressful and intimidating for the participants. So it's no surprise to me that at Sansa's nightmarish wedding in the show, she seemed a little out of it to the point where she probably didn't even realize what Joffrey stealing the stool meant or exactly what the septon was saying.

I'm not sure that book-Sansa has it in her (as of AFFC) to fall in love with anyone either in the future; but not because she can only fall in love with an idea; but because she's got huge trust issues regarding suitors and marriage and probably Love in general - thanks to Joffrey, Tyrion, Sandor and Littlefinger.
1584	WinterWarrior	2013-05-21	I thought the wedding was done well and if there is any whitewashing going on it has been with Cersei until she finally showed her claws with Margaery and Loras at the wedding. Cersei being Cersei is reassuring, I cant stand it when people start feeling sympathetic towards her, she is a loathsome toad.
I felt Sophie did a great job as Sansa with the whole wedding story....and Tyrion overdid the drunkedness. I don't remember him being so drunk in the book. Anyway, it was as if Sansa was the adult and Tyrion the inmature child.

The "marriage" video that's been posted has George himself pointing out that marriages among the nobility are based in politics, not love.  Part of the price you pay for living in nicer places, eating better good, and wearing better clothes than the rabble.  The only marriage we've seen that was based on love, Robb and Talisa's, ends in disaster.
1587	David Selig	2013-05-22	I see people all over the Internet saying how Tyrion is "as good of a guy as you get in Westeros" and how Sansa should fall in love with him if she knows what's good for her. Here for example - http://forums.televi...7#entry15750609

1589	Lord Freypie	2013-05-22	I think that Unsullied quote explain well why they had to make the change :As mentioned earlier in this thread, Sansa knew that she would have had to kneel for Tyrion and waited until he asked to do it as a moment of rebellion. She clearly knew that he could nnot reach her and I believe she knew that he footstool was taken. So, how was he going to put the protection cloak around her??? She made him ask because she wasn't going to do it if she wasn't asked to. I consider that rude. Although there are times where Sansa irks me, I generally don't have an issue with her, but I did in this episode.Showing even more resistance from Sansa without thoughts to explain her view would have been just a disaster for her character image (although they may have found a way to make her resist in a popular way, ie force the guards to carry her to the ceremony or something like that ; in the books she runs and the Lannisters have to threaten her to make her obey, for me it's a more important omission than not kneeling).Now I don't agree about the white washing of Tyrion in this particular episode. Not insisting on his desire for Sansa, and not making Sansa humiliate him in the ceremony, rather reduce his merit his my mind (he looks like he only resist Tywin wish instead of his own desire and eventual temptation to make her pay for the ceremony incident).The list of discuttable things he did before has been trimmed a lot in the show, but in this episode they avoided to make him look even better like they could have done Sansa refusing to kneel.
1590	Sansa in the North	2013-05-22	^^ That unsullied makes me angry. I mean, "as a moment of rebellion" and "I consider that rude". So Sansa rebelling against the people who are forcing her into a marriage she doesn't want is rude? That, of all things, is apparently what irks the OP. Oh well, it probably is for the best that she knelt if reactions are such already. /ack.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':ack:' /> I wish there was a button ''Punch them in the face''.This! /agree.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':agree:' />
1591	Woman of War	2013-05-22	But the  posters here who are especially interested in Sansa (someone in the PTP - thread called it the "Sansaverse", I looooove that expression) or even we posters here in general are not the target audience of HBO. Their main audience are the interested but not  dedicated readers, who simply enjoy and, of course, the "unsullied" , we forumites should not flatter ourselves here to be overly important, we , especially sub-groups of dedicated fandom, are only a very remote part of HBO followers. The more respect I have for the showmakers if they manage to transport the message in a condensed manner so that the book meaning does not get lost. And I think they succeeded in characterizing Sansa's and Tyrion's situation while having to make certain changes due to the medium: no inner monologues, no naked bodies of minors etc.
Only why  was Tyrion sooo very drunk after the two were alone in the room? In the book he sobered up and could at least speak coherently. Would he have been too nice and reasonable if he, in clear mind, had started a lengthy  speech about Sansa being too young for sex and, Milady, make no mistake, you very beautiful but I know the laws against child abuse..... No, they could not make him talk too reasonably since he was not standing there with a boner, he would have come over like the caring daddy replacement, some dirt, drunkenness and ogling  behind Sansa's back had to stay in the scene. Otherwise Tyrion would not have been Tyrion but turned into wise old Uncle Tyrion.
1592	Mladen	2013-05-22	http://25.media.tumb...m91uno1_500.jpgThis is a great picture (referencing it from other posts, but hadn't included the URL) - Sansa is like, OMG, I've married a Lannister dwarf, she's in shock, and Tyrion is drunk and seems to be admiring his scar.  The one picture that says it all. I wish that scenes had that sentiment.I see people all over the Internet saying how Tyrion is "as good of a guy as you get in Westeros" and how Sansa should fall in love with him if she knows what's good for her. Here for example - http://forums.televi...7#entry15750609Not whitewashed at all, right? /bang.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bang:' />I have seen those too. And I even see blaming Sansa for not seeing `how good he is`. And when the video about marriages came out, Dinklage sealed it when he said that `Tyrion tries to protect her`. I mean, wtf?But the  posters here who are especially interested in Sansa (someone in the PTP - thread called it the "Sansaverse", I looooove that expression) or even we posters here in general are not the target audience of HBO.And I loooooove how PTP thread doesn`t drop from your mouth... So sad...
1593	Lady Sansa Stark	2013-05-22	The one picture that says it all. I wish that scenes had that sentiment.Well, as you say, that one picture says it all. The scenes had that sentiment as well, Sansa's misery was clear in every scene. Except for the smile she gave to Tyrion about the wine, but I won't start about that. The awkwardness of the whole wedding was again shown when drunk Tyrion stumbled to the bedroom while saying stupid and humiliating things, after which Sansa followed, clearly feeling miserable.
1594	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-22	And when the video about marriages came out, Dinklage sealed it when he said that `Tyrion tries to protect her`. I mean, wtf? Are you saying that Tyrion did not try -- and in some cases succeed -- in protecting Sansa?

1595	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-22	^^ That unsullied makes me angry. I mean, "as a moment of rebellion" and "I consider that rude". So Sansa rebelling against the people who are forcing her into a marriage she doesn't want is rude?Well, Sansa apparantly considered it rude as well, so that unsullied is in good company.She felt another tug at her skirt, more insistant.  I won't.  Why should I spare his feelings, when no one cares about mine!The dwarf tugged at her for a third time. Stubbornly she pressed her lips togetehr and pretended not to notice.  Someone behind them tittered.  The queen, she thought, but it doesn't matter.  They were all laughing by then, Joffrey the loudest.  'Dontos, down on your hands and knees", the king commanded. "My uncle needs a boost to climb his bride."And so it was that her lord husband cloaked her up in the colors of House Lannister whilst standing on the back of a fool.When Sansa turned, the little man was gazing up at her, his mouth tight, his face red as her cload.  Suddenly she was ashamed of her stubborness.I simply do not understand people believing that this was one of Sansa's finest moments, when Sansa was ashamed of her own actions.  It is a complete misreading of the scene.  Had Sansa refused to walk down the aisle and had to be pushed or carried, or busted loose with a "you have no right to marry me off against my will after murdering my father", or some such line, that would have been a different story because it would then clearly have been opposing the entire wedding on principle. As the scene actually played out, the only statement she made was against Tyrion personally.  Everyone else, especially Joffrey, was laughing and enjoying Tyrion's embarassment.  Nobody there apparently took it as principled opposition.  They thought it funny.  And when Sansa realized that, she was ashamed of her actions.  How does showing that scene on-screen, necessarily without Sansa's internal acknowledgement of wrongdoing, help the perception of her character?  If she's doing something of which she is ashamed, wouldn't the audience be right in considering that action rude?

They thought it rude she didn't kneel right away for their Lord Tyrion Lannister.Though, in the books, I'm on the camp where I really liked the scene, including her stubbornness and her being ashamed of it. To me, it is indeed one of her finest moments. Her stubbornness reveals she is willing to oppose the Lannister family in any way she can, and her being ashamed of it shows that, though she has been through a lot, she has not lost her kindness and still cares for the wellbeing of people, even if they are from an ''enemy family'' for example.
1597	Maia	2013-05-22	In any case, the question of who actually inherits Casterly Rock would only be answered after Twyin has died, so in legal terms, Tywin's statement that Tyrion would never inherit the Rock was not "ripe" to be challenged at that time anyway.Well, in the books there are allusions by several characters that lords do have legal power to desinherit their children, it is just somewhat difficult to make it stick, particularly in case of a son. IMHO, that's why Tywin was careful never to give Tyrion any position of responsibility until he had his back against the wall in late AGOT and condoned public mocking of Tyrion by his bannermen. Which ensured that Tyrion would have had precious little support in the West, if he ever tried to fight for his inheritance - the Western lords clearly didn't see him as a prospective heir and knew that he'd have reasons to hold grudges against them.I also think that Tywin's intention not to let Tyrion inherit would have been widely understood and supported.Anyway, it was never clear to me how the practice of killing/abandoning dwarf children could be reconciled with the kinslaying tabu. Not to mention - I am not an expert, but is dwarfism usually even noticeable during early infancy?And I do think that in the books it was the kinslaying tabu that spared Tyrion's life early on, not any other consideration on Tywin's part.So no.  I give Tywin zero points for not abandoning Tyrion, or for funding his adulthood, because neither has anything to do with a praiseworthy sense of morality or compassion.Well, I never understood why Tywin didn't make Tyrion a septon or a maester. That would have resolved most of his succesion issues in a socially acceptable way, gotten the hated and irritating Tyrion out of his hair and likely would have let the family benefit from Tyrion's talents in the process, earlier and without all the drama. And again, everybody in the realms would have understood why he was doing this and agreed with him.  I really, really hope that we'd get some insight on this issue eventually,  because it it seems so nonsensical from Tywin's PoV not to do this. Particularly since he must have known from the maesters that there was a decent possibility that some of Tyrion's children would be dwarfs too.I do completely disagree with the assertion that Sansa knew that she was weddable and beddable as soon as she flowered in the books, because generally speaking that isn't the case in their society, as confirmed by GRRM.  She was at least a couple of years too young for that. But Joff made a specific threat about bedding her as soon as she flowered, which is why she flipped out so badly when she did. And Tyrion was entirely right to think of her as a child and feel guilty for desiring her.
1598	Mladen	2013-05-22	Are you saying that Tyrion did not try -- and in some cases succeed -- in protecting Sansa?No, I am saying that that notion didn`t exist at the time of wedding. Tyrion have protected her later, but his sentiment weren`t about protecting her.
1599	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-22	Though, in the books, I'm on the camp where I really liked the scene, including her stubbornness and her being ashamed of it. To me, it is indeed one of her finest moments. Her stubbornness reveals she is willing to oppose the Lannister family in any way she can,That's the part I don't see.  Opposing the Lannister family "in any way she can" would have been demonstrated by stating lodly right at the outset.  "You have no right to force me to marry into your family after killing my father", or some such.  And/or refusing to walk down the aisle and having to be more guided/dragged.  But we got none of that defiance again the wedding on principle.  She appears willing to go along with the whole thing except when it comes to Tyrion himself.The evidence is that neither the Lannisters nor the guests appeared to view her refusal to kneel as standing up to the Lannister family.   If they had, Cersei, Joffrey, and everyone else wouldn't have been laughing.  They would have been pissed.  But they weren't.  And that's clearly when it dawned on Sansa that her barb was misplaced, and was only hurting the one Lannister whom to whom she said "you have been kind to me", and amusing all the ones she hated.  She was ashamed because her anger was directed at the wrong person.and her being ashamed of it shows that, though she has been through a lot, she has not lost her kindness and still cares for the wellbeing of people, even if they are from an ''enemy family'' for example.We actually agree here, but the problem is that the shame that demonstrates her compassion only exists in her own head within the books, and is not something that would be apparent if you just showed the scene as written.  Had they shown that scene, the viewers would only have seen Sansa act in a way of which even she was ashamed, but without knowing that Sansa herself felt ashamed of it.  It would have made her look worse.I don't know -- maybe it's just different visual interpretations of the same scene, but Sansa realizing on her own that humiliating Tyrion (and amusing all the other Lannisters) was not right, and kneeling, actually struck me as a sign of maturity for which I admired her.  She correctly identified the true villians in that scene, and decided that depriving them of their amusement was the right course of action.  Good for her, I say.
1600	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-22	No, I am saying that that notion didn`t exist at the time of wedding. Tyrion have protected her later, but his sentiment weren`t about protecting her.I'd agree he didn't say that at the time, but he in fact did protect her before, during, and after the wedding, and even thought later that he would now be better able to protect her.  I think it's a distinction pretty much without a difference.
1601	Zman1863	2013-05-22	The Unsullied there were talking about the show, where Sansa didn't do it on purpose, apparently.

I see it as a benchmark of her growth from the childish self-centeredness that marked her throughout AGOT. I  also never really saw her refusal to kneel as being about opposition to the Lannisters- she doesn't do it because she is a Stark. It was more a personal act about about how the marriage was the opposite of all her fantasies. She was making a selfish, and completely justified act of defiance on which the barb fell on only one person and in a way that was cruel, and she recognized that and rectified it. As for the Unsullied, if they are getting on Sansa for how they portrayed the scene in the show, they would be screeching for Ser Illyn to snick off her head if they had portrayed the scene to the letter of the text. I also think that many Sansa fans would be calling D&D's heads if they had gone all out. They couldn't win on this scene; either they do it as in the book and get skewered for making Sansa look unsympathetic or they temper it and get accused of diminishing a big character moment.
1602	silentwanderer	2013-05-22	Tyrion is "as good of a guy as you get in Westeros"I agree Tyrion is as good of a guy as you get among the high borns in Westeros.If I've learned anything from Hodor, Podrick, Grey Worm, Davos or Gendry is that the good guys  on Westeros aren't exactly born noble.

I think it's a distinction pretty much without a difference.At the time of the wedding, he wasn`t thinking about protecting her, he was thinking about his own crappy situation. Even before the wedding, when Tywin ordered the wedding, the sentiment of protecting Sansa by marrying her didn`t exist. He did protect her when Joffrey wanted to show her her brother`s head and made her kiss it, but mostly Tyrion was preoccupied with his own trouble - Shae and the fact Sansa dispise him.I agree Tyrion is as good of a guy as you get among the high borns in Westeros.Really? The only think why he is so `good`, is because his father tortured him his entire life, and even then, he is capable of various attrocities. There are better men than him

Good for her, I say.With the ''in any way she can'' I meant ''in any way she can without getting beaten, abused and whatnot.'' Imagine what would have happened if she actually did this in the books. Meryn Trant approaching, taking out his sword, Joffrey getting some sadistic thoughts, Tywin being Tywin. They would actively (meaning abusing her and stuff) force her to marry Tyrion. And indeed, her not kneeling didn't hurt the Lannister family, I agree with you there, but it was merely some rash decision of her, an attempt to defy them which didn't work out. Still counts for me as a finest moment. And I didn't say I wanted the scene to be exactly as the books. I wrote a post some pages earlier how I liked the scene, as it could be far more horrible done than it was handled now. When Tyrion asked her to kneel, there was no way she would not kneel anymore, as he outright asked it and the people were already laughing. To me it seemed as she didn't do it on purpose, so ... Last point we agree again; as I already mentioned, it showed she hasn't lost her kindness and care for the well-being of people (you could also call it maturity, yes), in this case Tyrion Lannister.

And I have little pity with Edmure who  was not the least little bit disturbed by his bride crying during "consummation". Nobility brat like most of them.
1612	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-22	Anyway, it was never clear to me how the practice of killing/abandoning dwarf children could be reconciled with the kinslaying tabu. Not to mention - I am not an expert, but is dwarfism usually even noticeable during early infancy?I think there's a difference between abandoning and actually killing, at least in terms of that society.  If you have a malformed child that you cannot support, and "leave it to the Gods", that might be excusable.  Of course, not in the case of wealthy nobility, but otherwise, it may have a certain moral justification in a society where many people are barely surviving.  But affirmatively killing a child would be kinslaying, I think.Well, I never understood why Tywin didn't make Tyrion a septon or a maester.I know this discussion has been had previously, and I guess the answer was that Septon or Maester is too "low" a position for a Lannister, though it still seems like a weak explanation to me.  Honestly, I think this one is just explained by GRRM wanting him to be an active player rather than internal logic.  Uh, as you'll see from the way my post ends, I'm having a bit of deja vu right now, but I seem to remember George being asked this specific question back at Philcon, and essentially giving that answer about Tywin not thinkin it appropriate for a Lannister, and then Tyrion obviously not being the same character if that was the case.I do completely disagree with the assertion that Sansa knew that she was weddable and beddable as soon as she flowered in the books, because generally speaking that isn't the case in their society, as confirmed by GRRM.  Well, this turned out to be more interesting than I anticipated....So I decided to look this up on the various wikis to see what I could find on Westerosi marriage customes.  Finally found something that talked about it, which led to a "So Spake Martin" entry.  The entry -- which is a verbatim email from GRRM himself -- says essentially that there are two dividing lines -- "girlhood" to "maidenhood", which occurs at flowering, and then adulthood, which occurs at 16.  Marriages during girlhood are rare, and bedding would be considered perverse:....In the "general Westerosi view," well, girls may well be wed before their first flowerings, for political reasons, but it would considered perverse to bed them. And such early weddings, even without sex, remain rare. Generally weddings are postponed until the bride has passed from girlhood to maidenhood.  Maidens may be wedded and bedded... however, even there, many husbands will wait until the bride is fifteen or sixteen before sleeping with them. Very young mothers tend to have significantly higher rates of death in childbirth, which the maesters will have noted.As in the real Middle Ages, highborn girls tend to flower significantly earlier than those of lower birth. Probably a matter of nutrition. As a result, they also tend to marry earlier, and to bear children earlier.http://www.westeros....SSM/Entry/1050/Okay, so my reading of that is that it is not considered wrong to marry (and therefore consummate/bed) a maid who has flowered, but that after the consummation, the husband may not routinely sleep with his wife until she is older.  I think there is some specific textual support for that but I can't recall exactly where.  Sansa, also, is described as looking tall and womanly for her age, so I don't think Tyrion being attracted to her would be viewed as perverse in Westeros.The So Spake Martin entry was submitted based on an email a fan sent to George back in 1999, when you could still do that routinely and he'd respond, and you'd then forward them to whomever was administering the Board at the time. Funny that this exact same argument was going on 14 years ago!And here's the weird part -- that fan email question and response was submitted by me.  Forgot completely about that until I read it.  Ain't that some shit?  Cripe, you'd think I'd move on from regurgitating the same stuff....

1614	'96Buck	2013-05-22	Well, in the books there are allusions by several characters that lords do have legal power to desinherit their children, it is just somewhat difficult to make it stick, particularly in case of a son. IMHO, that's why Tywin was careful never to give Tyrion any position of responsibility until he had his back against the wall in late AGOT and condoned public mocking of Tyrion by his bannermen. Which ensured that Tyrion would have had precious little support in the West, if he ever tried to fight for his inheritance - the Western lords clearly didn't see him as a prospective heir and knew that he'd have reasons to hold grudges against them.I also think that Tywin's intention not to let Tyrion inherit would have been widely understood and supported.Anyway, it was never clear to me how the practice of killing/abandoning dwarf children could be reconciled with the kinslaying tabu. Not to mention - I am not an expert, but is dwarfism usually even noticeable during early infancy?And I do think that in the books it was the kinslaying tabu that spared Tyrion's life early on, not any other consideration on Tywin's part.Well, I never understood why Tywin didn't make Tyrion a septon or a maester. That would have resolved most of his succesion issues in a socially acceptable way, gotten the hated and irritating Tyrion out of his hair and likely would have let the family benefit from Tyrion's talents in the process, earlier and without all the drama. And again, everybody in the realms would have understood why he was doing this and agreed with him.  I really, really hope that we'd get some insight on this issue eventually,  because it it seems so nonsensical from Tywin's PoV not to do this. Particularly since he must have known from the maesters that there was a decent possibility that some of Tyrion's children would be dwarfs too.I do completely disagree with the assertion that Sansa knew that she was weddable and beddable as soon as she flowered in the books, because generally speaking that isn't the case in their society, as confirmed by GRRM.  She was at least a couple of years too young for that. But Joff made a specific threat about bedding her as soon as she flowered, which is why she flipped out so badly when she did. And Tyrion was entirely right to think of her as a child and feel guilty for desiring her.I suspect Tywin viewed becoming a septon or maester similar to how Randyll Tarly does...unworthy of his house.  Hard to imagine anyone being MORE obsessed with the status of his house than Tywin.  He goes to war over it, for Tyrion, who he'd personally rather see killed anyway.She certainly knew, that's why she tried to hide the sheets.
1615	'96Buck	2013-05-22	That's the part I don't see.  Opposing the Lannister family "in any way she can" would have been demonstrated by stating lodly right at the outset.  "You have no right to force me to marry into your family after killing my father", or some such.  And/or refusing to walk down the aisle and having to be more guided/dragged.  But we got none of that defiance again the wedding on principle.  She appears willing to go along with the whole thing except when it comes to Tyrion himself.That is stuff Arya would have done.  Sansa is going to comport herself "as a Lady."  She's prided herself on that throughout, it's the essence of her self-image.
1616	'96Buck	2013-05-22	I agree Tyrion is as good of a guy as you get among the high borns in Westeros.If I've learned anything from Hodor, Podrick, Grey Worm, Davos or Gendry is that the good guys  on Westeros aren't exactly born noble.And Vargo, Raff, Rorge, Chett, the Tickler, (arguably) Ramsay are born common.  Neither class has ANY monopoly on good OR evil.  It's just more impactful when someone powerful is also evil.
1617	'96Buck	2013-05-22	I think there's a difference between abandoning and actually killing, at least in terms of that society.  If you have a malformed child that you cannot support, and "leave it to the Gods", that might be excusable.  Of course, not in the case of wealthy nobility, but otherwise, it may have a certain moral justification in a society where many people are barely surviving.  But affirmatively killing a child would be kinslaying, I think.There might be a LEGAL difference, but there is no moral difference between killing an infant by abandoning him or by smothering (or whatever else) him.  How the gods might view it for purposes of the kinslayer being cursed, we have little evidence, but it seems more likely to me that intent, not method, would be of relevance to a celestial judge.
1618	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-22	That is stuff Arya would have done.  Sansa is going to comport herself "as a Lady."  She's prided herself on that throughout, it's the essence of her self-image.Well, I know, which is part of the reason so many people like Arya better.  ff Sansa is going to comport herself "like a lady", then she is not "opposing them in any way she can", but rather is restraining her opposition because she believes being lady-like is more important than standing up for what is right.
1619	Sniraga	2013-05-22	I thought the wedding scene worked pretty well. Joffrey was appropriately smug, Sansa hold to her dignity and Tyrion went through with the ceremony. I was glad D&D omitted the scene in which Tyrion told Sansa that if she wished, she could marry some other Lannister in his stead, because it would've been a bit too much in the show's context.
It has been pretty clear that the show Tyrion wouldn't try to bed Sansa as eagerly as his book counterpart, so no real surprises/disappointments there. They did manage to convey the awkwardness of the situation and that's what matters the most, I think. And kudos for reminding the audience of Sansa's age.
I wasn't a fan of Tyrion's comic relief behavior at the wedding banquet though and making the morning after about Tyrion/Shae romance went a bit amiss imo as well.
1620	'96Buck	2013-05-22	Well, I know, which is part of the reason so many people like Arya better.  ff Sansa is going to comport herself "like a lady", then she is not "opposing them in any way she can", but rather is restraining her opposition because she believes being lady-like is more important than standing up for what is right.But throwing a temper tantrum isn't meaningful opposition.  I tell my kids they might as well not bother since it won't change outcomes.  She's not required to be irrational...though normally she is anyway.
1621	silentwanderer	2013-05-22	And Vargo, Raff, Rorge, Chett, the Tickler, (arguably) Ramsay are born common.   Neither of them are marriage material, not like Hodor, Podrick, Grey Worm, Davos or Gendry seem to be. There are two classes of commoners in the books: those who enjoy the slaughter - like Vargo, Raff, Rorge, Chett and Ramsay -  and those who fight for their Lords only to go back to be brothers, fathers, husbands and sons by the end of the war.

Or said another way, there are 2 kinds of people, those who divide things into 2 types, and those who don't.
1626	silentwanderer	2013-05-22	To me, the nobles don't have that luxury because they are always at odds with each other.
I see it like the Hound does: some high borns may enjoy killing a little bit more than others, but they all enjoy killing.

1627	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-22	Regrett less? She would be beaten. She can't act like Arya would, or she wouldn't survive five minutes. Just as Sansa wouldn't survive five minutes is Aray's situation, Arya wouldn't survive in Sansa's.You think they'd beat her in open court, on the day she's going to be married, with the Tyrells and everyone else present?  I don't.  I think someone would just speak to her and make her go out there.  The important part isn't going through it, but to state your objections publcly before you do.  But the point would be made.  It would just take a more assertive personality than she has.  And, suppose she does get smacked.  Not the end of the world if you're pissed at what they've done to your family.In any case, that is certainly an option that she didn't choose, so the claim that she did "whatever she could" to oppose the marriage is simply false.  All she accomplished in the book by not kneeling was 1) embarassing Tyrion, and 2) amusing the rest of the Lannisters.  Not exactly a statement of which she should be (or was) proud.Just because she keeps her dignity doesn't mean she isn't opposing them. You can be lady-like and still be strong and stand up for what is right. That's the whole point of Sansa's character.Except she didn't.  She went along with the whole thing, didn't do anything to suggest opposition other than to embarass the only Lannister who was "kind to her" (her words prior to the wedding, not mine), and to amuse the rest of them.
1628	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-22	Being dragged to the altar screaming = temper tantrum.Yeah, except I didn't say anything about screaming.  She's standing there before it starts, makes a statement that everyone can hear, then walks down the aisle glaring at the Lannisters.  No screaming, no tantrum, no immaturity.  Just telling it like it is so her opposition in on the record.
1629	Sansa in the North	2013-05-22	You think they'd beat her in open court, on the day she's going to be married, with the Tyrells and everyone else present?  I don't.

In any case, not wanting to get hit doesn't mean that you don't have an assertive personality. Avoiding getting beaten is just common sense.
1630	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-22	I thought Joffrey did beat her in open court in ACOK.Agreed, but that would be different from beating her on her wedding day, in front of the Tyrells and everyone else.  Just for starters, that would abort the wedding, which is something the Lannisters very much did not want.  In fact, that was her best opportunity to actually get out a zinger or two and avoid repercussions.In any case, not wanting to get hit doesn't mean that you don't have an assertive personality. Avoiding getting beaten is just common sense.I think that very much depends on what you're giving up to avoid the beating.  The coward's course isn't always the best.But look, the bottom line is one you haven't addressed.  The action you characterize as admirable defiance did not work out that way.  The Lannisters and their guests simply laughed when Sansa didn't kneel, because it was at Tyrion's expense rather than theirs.  Even if her intent was to defy "the Lannisters" in some statement of principle (which I don't think was her intent anyway), it inarguably failed to do that.  Instead, the only thing it accomplished was to embarassed the one guy who had been kind to her, and make her ashamed of herself for doing in the first place.  That's not my interpretation -- that's what the actual text says.

That's not my interpretation -- that's what the actual text says.Agreed, she didn't embarrass the rest of the Lannisters, only Tyrion. But it was never her intention to embarrass anyone, I think. That's why, when she saw how humiliated Tyrion was, she felt shame and knelt to kiss him (because Sansa is just amazing like that, she still hasn't lost her compassion). Her intent, as I see it, was to show that she was doing this under duress. They could make her marry (legally, she was a ward of the crown) but they couldn't make her kneel. And her gesture made this clear. She was showing her defiance against the marriage itself. She wasn't trying to embarrass anyone. And this would not have been accomplished better by refusing to walk to the altar or saying something that would get her beaten, because not wanting to get beaten just shows that you have a healthy self preservation instinct. Sansa acted dignified throughout the ceremony and I admire her for it.
1632	juanml82	2013-05-22	People, if Sansa said "No law of men or gods can force me to marry him if I don't want to, and I don't want to", she would be quietly carried off the sept while someone says the ceremony isn't done yet. Then, she'll be quietly hit in all ways and places that won't leave visible bruising until she accepts to get married.
She was previously hit with an armoured gauntlet several times. I think it's fair to assume book Sansa left King's Landing with a few less teeth than the amount she had when she first reached the capitol.
1633	Wouter	2013-05-22	I noted that tywin actually looked rather annoyed in the show; when a couple behind him laughed quite loudly,tywin gave them "the death stare" and they quickly calmed down. I don't remember how it was described in the books (tywin's reaction), but it would have been perfectly in character to act as in the show. Cersei may laugh, but tywin always hated it when lannisters were made a laughing matter.
I thought it was rather symbolic that it was the presence of joffrey that stopped tyrion from "draping his protection" over sansa, just as his protection was a sham while he was keeping her in joffrey's power. Only after she accepts it by kneeling can hid protection mean anything.

1635	Woman of War	2013-05-22	.....Just because she keeps her dignity doesn't mean she isn't opposing them. You can be lady-like and still be strong and stand up for what is right. That's the whole point of Sansa's character.Sansa has internalized her septa's lesson: it is paramount to keep up appearances no matter what happens and what this might cost you.I do not think this is cowardice, it is a special kind of bravery, a very limited idea of dignity that may take a certain kind of determination and self denial. Other women - or men - may see dignity in having the courage to do and to speak what has to be done and said even if those who disagree see you as embarrassing and ridiculous. This would be the worst shame for Sansa: being embarrassing. But that courtesy comes at  a price: you will not be listened to when it really counts. And you will not get the pride from having forced others to listen to you even if you may lose in the end.Yes, Sansa might have been pushed  to the altar in the end. But before they could have stopped her she could have made her dislike clear for every witness to hear, and not against her equally miserable bridegroom but against the really guilty ones.Now you can say that open resistance is not Sansa's style, she is no Rosa Parks. She does not want the satisfaction of having proudly spoken up for all to hear, she prefers undercover action. But what should be her action then? Being clever in evaluating her situation and looking out for allies behind everyone's back. The first adress for clever alliance for survival against Joffrey would have been Tyrion. Dontos in the books is sheer coinidence given to her by a great schemer and a big betrayal in the end. She had taken what fell into her lap instead of actively seeking for options.We do not know what HBO Sansa will do. Maybe she will be forced to go with LF since otherwise she would be put on trial as well. Maybe she will start to make common cause for self preservation with Tyrion before the Purple wedding. But then HBO Sansa is two years older than book Sansa and we can expect more initiative from her.

It shows your anger, but also that you've hit the wrong target.She was showing her defiance against the marriage itself.That's not what she was thinking at the time, as shown by those quotes.  She wanted puppies and a strong, handsome prince, so she wasn't going to kneel for this dwarf who was too short to put the marriage cloak on her.

But as I've said, if you show that scene as written, but without the audience being privy to Sansa's internal self-critique, that would have been an unfair portrayal.  So rather than showing her making a mistake, and not showing her regret, they filmed it without her making the mistake.

But since nobody is advocating that she refuse to be married, but instead only make a statement prior to (or perhaps during) the ceremony, that's irrelevant.  And in fact, I'm not even advocating that.  I'm simply offering that as one thing she could have done, in response to someone who claimed that she did "everything she could" to resist.

The fact that she doesn't want this marriage is exactly what I meant.

Say you are a prisoner in guantanamo or somewhere like that. You don't want to get tortured, obviously, so you don't provoke the guards. Does that make you a coward? It really doesn't, imo, and Sansa's situation isn't all that different.Morover saying something like "screw all Lannisters!" that would only get her beaten wouldn't be bravery. It would be stupidity.------But what should be her action then? Being clever in evaluating her situation and looking out for allies behind everyone's back.

We, the readers can see inside his head, but Sansa can't. Tyrion is a Lannister, actively working against her family. And I am not convinced that Tyrion would ever have chosen Sansa over his family. I don't expect him to. And he didn't. He married her, because his family wanted it.

She was thinking of the things she could've gotten and what the Lannisters took away from her. And then she thinks ''Yeah, screw you Lannisters, I won't kneel for you anyway.'' Depends on how you read it. Could be petulance, but to me that's an act of defiance. And why wouldn't she be petulant? The Lannisters had taken away everything for her, forced a marriage upon her with the ugliest dwarf you could possibly imagine, when all she dreamed of was the things she thought just before the wedding ceremony. Heck, I would be angry as anyone could be after being mortified by a wedding like that. We all have our dreams, even, or perhaps especially, when everything is taken away from us. I would try to defy them, at least in some way. And then there is this quote right before the cloaking. ''Thankfully no one seemed to notice that she was crying as she stood there, wrapped in her father<U+0080><U+0099>s colors''.Right before the cloaking, she did everything that was required of her. And then there's the cloaking itself, where she is molested by Joffrey himself. I just can't blame her for not kneeling, I can't call it anything other than a little moment of defiance.But. I really came here to post this quote. Sums up the love for Tyrion by Unsullied:''While I feel bad for Sansa, I feel worse for Tyrion. Forcibly married to a shallow 14 year old who will never learn to appreciate what he has to offer.

Tyrion is a Lannister, actively working against her family......Agree, there is some truth in it. But then Sansa never even tried to find out about Tyrion's situation and a possible common interest. She could have started with superficially unimportant topics, testing him with yet harmless comments, presenting herself as curious child and thus evaluating his position without giving too much of herself, gradually forming a common ground and making use of it. I guess she was too young for that kind of subtle cleverness.But. I really came here to post this quote.

And she is showing her defiance angainst THIS marriage in principle, not Tyrion specifically.THIS marriage is Tyrion specifically.And being disappointed that you have to marry a Lannister dwarf instead of the husband you dreamed of isn't petulance, it's quite normal and human.That's true.  But it's also no statement of principle or defiance, and in fact, would have been no different from sulking because it was a marriage arranged by your parents that you didn't like.  That's the trade-off for being a noble.  You get beautiful dresses, handmaidens, never want for food, or shelter, don't have to work, etc..  In exchange, you're going to marry for political convenience rather than love, just as Edmure had to marry a Frey.  That's the deal.Morover saying something like "screw all Lannisters!" that would only get her beaten wouldn't be bravery. It would be stupidity.Again, nobody is saying she should say that.No, Tyrion is not the natural ally for her, from her point of view. We, the readers can see inside his head, but Sansa can't. Tyrion is a Lannister, actively working against her family. And I am not convinced that Tyrion would ever have chosen Sansa over his family. I don't expect him to. And he didn't. He married her, because his family wanted it.He's the best ally she's going to get in the situation she's currently in with respect to Joffrey, though.  Whatever readers may think of Tyrion, Sansa herself has seen Tyrion stand up for her, and noted to him "you were kind to me".  Given her recognition of that fact, choosing to embarass him in particular is just not very bright.
1642	Lady Sansa Stark	2013-05-22	Lady Sansa Stark,but then please be aware that the same "unsullied" will only shake her or his head over your postsI know and I am aware of that, which is what worries me the most. /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />Really, I have seen many posts about Tyrion and Sansa, but that one particularly baffled me.
1643	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-22	Why wouldn't it amount to defiance? She was thinking of the things she could've gotten and what the Lannisters took away from her.Puppies.  This is what bugs people about Sansa.  There are all these very terrible things going on around her, with horrible suffering, and she's thinking about puppies.And then she thinks ''Yeah, screw you Lannisters, I won't kneel for you anyway.'' Depends on how you read it.Well, the text very clearly does not say what you just imputed to her.  The quotes I gave are direct.Could be petulance, but to me that's an act of defiance. And why wouldn't she be petulant? The Lannisters had taken away everything for her, forced a marriage upon her with the ugliest dwarf you could possibly imagine, when all she dreamed of was the things she thought just before the wedding ceremony.Again, that's part of the point.  Leaving the Lannisters completely out of this, marriage in Westeros is not fairy tales, but politics.  George himself says that.  Sansa's insistence on that fairy tale is sheer immaturity.Heck, I would be angry as anyone could be after being mortified by a wedding like that. We all have our dreams, even, or perhaps especially, when everything is taken away from us. I would try to defy them, at least in some way.Do you understand that putting yourself into that position is not the same as Sansa being in that position?  She is a highly privileged member of the nobility, and knows that marriages are arranged for political reasons.  She just chooses to block that out.I just can't blame her for not kneeling.I think I'd rather go with Sansa's own characterization of her actions.  Something of which she was ashamed.  You apparently think she's wrong to feel that way, and that's fine.  But surely at that point, it starts looking more like you're reading the scene as you wish rather than how it was actually written and perceived by the characters.''While I feel bad for Sansa, I feel worse for Tyrion. Forcibly married to a shallow 14 year old who will never learn to appreciate what he has to offer. He may not be gorgeous (he is still good looking!), but there is a lot more to love than looks.''  Really, I had to read that thing twice.Well, noting that the reader does actually feel badly for Sansa as well, I think it is a perfectly valid perspective.  I'm married, and the thought of being married to "Future Dance Mom of Westeros" Sansa is pretty abhorrent.  But I think such things are a matter of taste/POV, about which reasonable people may differ.  As long as there is a recognition that Sansa has a right to not be happy about this marriage, I don't see the basis for complaint about relative levels of misery.

As long as there is a recognition that Sansa has a right to not be happy about this marriage, I don't see the basis for complaint about relative levels of misery.Alright, apparently you think that what you say is the only valid thing, but reading a book is all a matter of interpretation. Hence why we all have our different favourite characters, because we have different interpretations of what characters do, say and think. There is not one good way of looking at it. Doesn't work for the Bible, doesn't work for a Song of Ice and Fire. So while you interpret it as petulance and shallow dreaming, I interpret the action itself as defiance, keeping in mind what she thought before the wedding. And there a discussion is born. I don't really think Sansa was brought up with the idea that arranged marriages are always horrible and that you need to do your duty, even if it's the enemy you're marrying. She was brought up with stories and dreams, and lived a sheltered life as a happy eleven-year-old highborn girl, and she never lost that dream. She was even promised the same fairytale if she would've married Willas. She remembers what she wanted her wedding to be and what she could have had, which is completely normal right before you marry into an enemy family. Calling that sheer immaturity is fine with me. Again, Sansa perhaps knew that a marriage would be arranged for her later on, but that is about it. Unless you really think her parents filled her head with horrible stories and situations like the one she was in at that moment, but I assume you don't. She was not prepared for this, no one would be prepared for this.  This wasn't even an arranged marriage, she was told 10 minutes before the wedding she was going to marry, under threats of abuse and whatnot. That is still a forced marriage in my books. I'd like to quote something i said earlier here: '' I'm on the camp where I really liked the scene, including her stubbornness and her being ashamed of it.'' So, including her being ashamed; I don't deny she felt that way, I even highlight the fact that I liked that part. I won't even start about the watcher's (not reader's) quote. No. I won't.

She was brought up with stories and dreams, and lived a sheltered life as a happy eleven-year-old highborn girl, and she never lost that dream.Well, but Arya was brought up in the same household and didn't see things that way, and Ned (I think it was him) actually had a talk with her telling her that life wasn't fairy tales (there may have been a conversation with Catelyn to the same effect), and even Sandor sniffed out that Sansa was more cuaght up in fairy tales than the average girl.  Not every noble-born girl lived those fairy tales the was Sansa did.I'd like to quote something i said earlier here: '' I'm on the camp where I really liked the scene, including her stubbornness and her being ashamed of it.'' So, including her being ashamed; I don't deny she felt that way, I even highlight the fact that I liked that part.Actually, so did I.  I liked her in the book during that scene (though the puppies and tall strong lord stuff still bugged me), and I liked her on the show.  I would not have liked her as much if the show would have included the refusal to kneel, then necessarily excluded her subsequent regret and shame.  And that's why I think those who are upset that she didn't refuse to kneel in the show have missed the point -- absent the internal monologue of being ashamed, viewers would have gotten an entirely different, and incorrect, reading of Sansa.

And what if she is more caught up in fairy tales and dreams and stuff? Apparently, no one has told her that life in King's Landing isn't like what she expected it to be, (and I don't really assume Catelyn or Ned told her to). She said so in the show. It's a shame that Ned didn't have some conversations with her, really. Yet, how could anyone ever prepare her for this? While Arya obviously has a different personality than Sansa and is more like Lyanna and doesn't like all those fairy tales, Sansa does. If that makes her immature, so be it. Doesn't mean she should let it all just go, and should have known that life doesn't always go the way you want. She dreamed of her wedding when she was young, she knew how she wanted it to be, and I don't blame her for that.ETA:Have a nice evening, everyone. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />

1647	Mulled Wino	2013-05-22	Sansa has internalized her septa's lesson: it is paramount to keep up appearances no matter what happens and what this might cost you.I do not think this is cowardice, it is a special kind of bravery, a very limited idea of dignity that may take a certain kind of determination and self denial. Other women - or men - may see dignity in having the courage to do and to speak what has to be done and said even if those who disagree see you as embarrassing and ridiculous. This would be the worst shame for Sansa: being embarrassing. But that courtesy comes at  a price: you will not be listened to when it really counts. And you will not get the pride from having forced others to listen to you even if you may lose in the end.Yes, Sansa might have been pushed  to the altar in the end. But before they could have stopped her she could have made her dislike clear for every witness to hear, and not against her equally miserable bridegroom but against the really guilty ones.Now you can say that open resistance is not Sansa's style, she is no Rosa Parks. She does not want the satisfaction of having proudly spoken up for all to hear, she prefers undercover action. But what should be her action then? Being clever in evaluating her situation and looking out for allies behind everyone's back. The first adress for clever alliance for survival against Joffrey would have been Tyrion. Dontos in the books is sheer coinidence given to her by a great schemer and a big betrayal in the end. She had taken what fell into her lap instead of actively seeking for options.We do not know what HBO Sansa will do. Maybe she will be forced to go with LF since otherwise she would be put on trial as well. Maybe she will start to make common cause for self preservation with Tyrion before the Purple wedding. But then HBO Sansa is two years older than book Sansa and we can expect more initiative from her.her bridegroom is nowhere near being close to as equally miserable.  Thats the problem.  Its not even in the same galaxy

Because he's ugly, and she's not?Tyrion is a highly intelligent, worldly man, desperate to be loved for who he is despite his looks.  He's now been bound, for life, with a maid who doesn't seem to be the brightest bulb on the tree, who is fascinated by fairy tales about incredibly handsome lords, beautiful ladies, etc..  In short, the absolute last type of person who may ever give him what he wants.  He's more mature than she is, and more used to disappointment, so he may not be as acutely depressed at the heading as she is.  But long term, I don't think his situation is objectively any more enviable than hers, which is why opinions as to who is getting the worse deal may differ.

All of the posts from the last few pages are a waste because the argument stops at "he's a lannister".Not wanting to marry a Lannister is mentionned first but one time in all Sansa thoughts of this chapter, and only to think 2 lines after that Lannister or Tyrell it's the same as they want her for the claim.I hardly see how her arguements can stop at "he's a Lannister" when all her thoughts about Tyrion aren't about "he's a Lannister", but more things like "he is ugly" or "but he was nice" or worries about what she should do to be a good lady.Of course t's possible to argue that she finds Tyrion ugly because he is a Lannister, but it's not even finding Tyrion ugly the problem.Her most important feeling for him is not the fear or hate she should have for Lannisters, it's pity, first after the kneeling incident, then after he makes his speech about wanting to be good for her and she realise he is as afraid as her ("All she felt was pity, and pity was death to desire", even showing that she may have desired Tyrion would he have been confident enough to ease her).I know it's terribly disturbing, but it's how it's written in the text.

No Lannisters is the most important, it excludes Jamie, who would be everything she wanted. If she ever said, "if only it could be jamie", there would actually be an argument there, The rest of what she thinks is just musings of a young girl trying to make the best of her situation and letting her mind wander.Sansa shows plenty of hatred for the lannisters throughout her chapters.  Im pretty sure this isnt something we need additional mention of.regarding the tyrells wanting her claim, she was open to willas the cripple

1663	Sansa in the North	2013-05-23	I agree with the posters who are saying that Sansa doesn't want any Lannister and that's the most important thing. But also, yes, she doesn't want him because he is a dwarf. So what. Who would want to marry a noseless dwarf? And what the hell is so wrong with her dreaming about handsome lords? Tyrion himself fantasies about beautiful women all the time and has little time for ugly women such as Lollys, whom he mocks. At least Sansa doesn't mock Tyrion with statements such as "I'd rather feed it to the goats". In fact, she tries very hard to find the beauty in him, like her septa taught her. I doubt Tyrion would do the same for Lollys. Why is he allowed to dream and she isn't? Why is he allowed to want a beautiful woman but she isn't allowed to want a handsome man?

1665	Jacob17	2013-05-23	The context has just been completely lost.  Tyrion is not a paragon of virtue because he's a product of his society. Westeros is a pretty brutal place, where things that would be intolerable here are fairly well accepted there.  Cruelty during war, swift justice/revenge for perceived slights, etc..  There are a great many ways in which Tyrion does not rise above this setting.  The common listing of his sins -- Marillion's fingers, etc. -- don't seem to many to be outside the norm of what other Westerosi would see as something to be expected in those particular circumstancesHowever, I think most fans accept those cultural norms as the baseline for judging characters.  We praise characters who rise above them, and condemn those who are even worse.  Tyrion has most of the flaws common to Westerosi nobility, so those flaws are unremarkable.  Literally -- it's not really worthy of remarking on them because that's understood as the baseline of the world the author created.  So it's not that Tyrion is perfect.  It's that his flaws are unremarkable in the context of the setting.Tyrion deservedly gets sympathy right off the bat because of the abuse heaped on him simply because of what he is -- a dwarf.  He gets treated like the only black guy in a world full of racists.  Sure, his money can buy him temporary friends and pleasures, but he is prejudged virtually everywhere he goes, and has been considered defective and twisted from birth, openly mocked in social settings, simply because of an accident of birth.  People who don't even know him hate him, and deride him as "the Imp".  And that's completely overlooking the abuse at the hands of his father and sister, and the twisted Lannister morality in which he was raised that devalued everyone who wasn't a Lannister.Given that treatment, from virtually all of his peers, the fact that he has retained his humanity and, in many instances, risen above the standards of the day, is remarkable.  The fact that he has retained a sense of humor is remarkable.  Fans like him because of his positive qualities that have been listed previously, in particular his demonstrated concern for people to whom he owes nothing.  Bran, Jon, etc..  When no other member of Westerosi nobility would stand up for Sansa, Tyrion did, though he had absolutely nothing to gain by it.   When he had every legal right to take Sansa's maidenhead, secure the marriage, and set himself up as a future Lord of Winterfell, and when his peers expected him to do exactly that -- he didn't.  Even though he actually had physical urges to do that, he resisted them and stopped.  Simply because he thought it was a wrong thing to do to her, regardless of what the rest of the Court thought.That does not make him anything close to perfect.  But it does make him someone with some very admirable qualities.You nailed it!

1666	Jacob17	2013-05-23	Tyrion is the most important of the "cripples bastards and broker things" that are the heroes of the story.  Most of the bad things he has done are him struggling to deal with a world that shits on him because he is a little person.  His ability to survive the constant hatred and make the sound moral choices he makes is truly heroic.  To put it more accurately, his sound moral compass is a RESULT of his challenging experience.  Because he has been despised all of this life for no other reason than because he is a dwarf, he is more sympathetic to the plights of Sansa, Bran, Jon, and Varys.
I was actually think that Sansa was "whitewashed" in the show.  In the book she doesn't kneel because she is so disapointed that she is marrying a short guy.  Her refusal was a petty and vain act that harkened back to her betrayal of Arya at the Darry castle.  To give Sansa credit, even  she immediately realized how cruel it was.  I don't see where people got that her refusal to kneel was an act of defiance.  There is nothing defiant going on in her inner monolouge during the ceremony at all.  
I don't really blame Sansa because she is so young, but I have a hard time sympathising with her.  Time and time again she chose the Lannisters over her own family.  She failed to support Arya, then she ran and told the Cersei that Ned was going to take her away.  I'm pretty sure she was the last person in all of Westeros to realize that Joffrey was a creep.  20 minutes before the wedding she is all excited about marrying a Lannister ally, but the minute her bridegroom is a dwarf she starts singing a different tune.  Hopefully her judgement improves over time, and she is able to make some true allies in the Vale.  It will make for a nice redemption story to parallel Jaime's redemption arc. 
They both started out as good looking favored sons and daughters who didn't face sufficient challenges in life to develop a moral compass.  In other words, they are two of the "anti- cripples, bastards, and broken things." Now they both have had their world turned upside down.  We'll see where they go from there. 
Maybe Sansa's ultimate act of redemption will be reuniting and embracing  Nymeria, the direwolf she betrayed.  I think she needs to get in touch with her inner wolf to get back on track.
1667	David Selig	2013-05-23	I agree with the posters who are saying that Sansa doesn't want any Lannister and that's the most important thing. But also, yes, she doesn't want him because he is a dwarf. So what. Who would want to marry a noseless dwarf? And what the hell is so wrong with her dreaming about handsome lords? Tyrion himself fantasies about beautiful women all the time and has little time for ugly women such as Lollys, whom he mocks. At least Sansa doesn't mock Tyrion with statements such as "I'd rather feed it to the goats". In fact, she tries very hard to find the beauty in him, like her septa taught her. I doubt Tyrion would do the same for Lollys. Why is he allowed to dream and she isn't? Why is he allowed to want a beautiful woman but she isn't allowed to want a handsome man?This. All of us would rather marry a good looking spouse than a hideous looking one (everything else being equal), that's human nature. Nothing shallow about it.Besides, not only Tyrion is super ugly, but he is a major scumbag too. I wouldn't wish him for a husband on my worst enemy.

1668	Rapsie	2013-05-23	Tyrion is the most important of the "cripples bastards and broker things" that are the heroes of the story.  Most of the bad things he has done are him struggling to deal with a world that shits on him because he is a little person.Tyrion is one of the most privileged men in Westeros. Apart from his father and sister we are shown that the rest of his family like him and care for him. He is penalised because of his disability which is horrific, but that does not give him the right to attack others in return. Having a disability, does not mean you get to do random acts of violence.His ability to survive the constant hatred and make the sound moral choices he makes is truly heroic.What sound moral choices? Tyrion has acts of kindness but makes very few sound moral choices, and even then some are less than altruistic. He makes the saddle for BranHas Allar Deem and Janos Slynt punishedHelps PennySave JorahAnyway please explain how being discriminated against means it's okay for him to do the following:Break Marillion's FingersBe amused at his father murdering Masha HeddleWanting the entire Vale to burn because of Lysa and Cat, when he knows that his sister and brother were behind Bran's attempted murder.Slapping ShaeGiving the Antler Men to JoffLetting his Wildlings loose to rape and kill in KLPoisoning CerseiKidnapping Tommen and being prepared to rape him if necessaryHis views on Lollys StockworthBeing part of the forced marriage to SansaKilling ShaeThreatening and possibly raping the indentured servant in PentosRaping the slave in SelhorysSlapping PennyAlso Tyrion has a POV that is self-pitying. He takes things for insults that aren't. For instance Benjen offers him a cloak and Tyrion takes it for a slight, rather than what it is or when Bywater tells him the people hate him because they are starving and his Wildlings are rampaging through the city and Tyrion ignores these reason and thinks it is because he is a dwarf. I was actually think that Sansa was "whitewashed" in the show.  In the book she doesn't kneel because she is so disapointed that she is marrying a short guy.What? She doesn't want to marry ANY Lannister but does think he is better than Lancel. She has been dragged to the alter being told this man beside her will wed her and rape her despite what she wants. She is crying through the ceremony and she knows Tyrion wasn't dragged there by guards and knew about it in advance. He has been involved in this as much as Cersei and Joff. The whole room doesn't care about her loss of happiness and possible freedom and being forced to marry one of her jailors who belongs to the family that have murdered hers at the age of 12! It is hardly petty to think why should I make it easier or my jailor and save his feelings when no one cares about hers. The fact that she feels sorry for him when people laugh, is a testament to how bloody nice she is. If it had been me, I'd have been screaming the whole time, laughed along with the congregation and pushed him off Dontos's back as soon as I had the chance. Then again maybe if I was a twelve year old who had seen my father beheaded in front of me and been beaten almost daily for a year anytime I said he wrong thing, I wouldn't. Time and time again she chose the Lannisters over her own family.  She failed to support Arya, then she ran and told the Cersei that Ned was going to take her away.She said "I don't remember" because she was terrified. If Arya hadn't immediately attacked her, Ned might have got her to tell her story. She sided with neither Arya or Joff.If Ned had told Sansa the same speech he gave to Arya, then maybe she would not have gone to Cersei. She was a teenage girl who thought she was in love, asking to stay was disobedient but not picking the Lannisters over her family.I'm pretty sure she was the last person in all of Westeros to realize that Joffrey was a creep.Sadly very true.20 minutes before the wedding she is all excited about marrying a Lannister ally, but the minute her bridegroom is a dwarf she starts singing a different tune.Not quite. 20 minutes before she is accepting that she will marry a cripple that will at least protect her and get her out of KL before being told she will forcibly be married to one of her Jailors.It will make for a nice redemption story to parallel Jaime's redemption arc.Sansa has done nothing she needs redemption or.Maybe Sansa's ultimate act of redemption will be reuniting and embracing  Nymeria, the direwolf she betrayed. How on earth did she betray Nymeria?
1669	David Selig	2013-05-23	Tyrion's "sound moral compass"...that's the funniest thing I've read all day. How many murders and rapes did he commit again?
He spent most of the series trying his hardest to keep a sadistic illegitimate psychopath on the Throne. His moral compass was pointing firmly at Casterly Rock.

In the book she doesn't kneel because she is so disapointed that she is marrying a short guy.Ignoring how that wasn't the reason, maybe she would have knelt in the books if Tyrion actually acted like an adult thus either asked her or made other preparations where neither would have to be embarrassed only for that to be taken away by Joffrey like what happened in the show.Instead, book:Tyrion just expected her to further humiliate herself rather do anything to prepare for a part of the ceremony that he knew was going to happen that would have taken him an ounce of effort.  And that is only after he cowardly refused to warn her about the wedding until the absolute last second and even then he was too late in his talking to her.Wait, sorry here I am expecting an adult to be the mature one instead of the abused and terrified young girl.

You forgot the singer stew.But there is no point in reinterpreting. Tyrion is meant to be a morally diversified, a so-called grey character. That's the point in his character: He is not the noble and helpless martyr, the victim easy to root for because we can wholeheartedly pity him., He is no Uncle Tom, he bites back, he tries to keep his head high despite the worst of humiliations. He refuses the role of passive victim. No, he is not meant to make it easy for us readers, the poor downtrodden politically correct vertically challenged handicapped, an abstract idea of victimhood. No,Tyrion is a hugely compelling character, a very much complete person, more "alive" than nearly all other characters in the books, who happens to be handicapped but is for sure not reduced to that as defining trait.A challenge meant for readers who don't need easy answers.Also Tyrion has a POV that is self-pitying. He takes things for insults that aren't. For instance Benjen offers him a cloak and Tyrion takes it for a slight, rather than what it is or when Bywater tells him the people hate him because they are starving and his Wildlings are rampaging through the city and Tyrion ignores these reason and thinks it is because he is a dwarf.there is some truth in it. He has experienced the superstitions against him all his lifetime so his first reaction is to see dislike where it usually comes from and not for why it might be justified. After a lifetime of despice experiences he in general has not sufficiently learned to distinguish genuine emotions from fake ones and prejudices.What? She doesn't want to marry ANY Lannister but does think he is better than Lancel. She has been dragged to the alter being told this man beside her will wed her and rape her despite what she wants. She is crying through the ceremony and she knows Tyrion wasn't dragged there by guards and knew about it in advance. He has been involved in this as much as Cersei and Joff.This is just not true. Sansa can know that it was Tyrion who protected her when Joffrey tortured her and everyone else around did nothing but watching.Of course she did not want to be wed that way but after that she could have tried to use the situation to her advantage, especially after she knew thatTyrion would not rape her.The whole room doesn't care about her loss of happiness and possible freedomexactly. People may have been grossed out because she was so young but on principle the same fate, being fucked by someone they did not choose, had awaited most of the women present and most of the men had raped their young wives. People laughing were not all sadists, they were children of their timesetting, just like those who laughed at Tyrion after Shae's testimony.The fact that she feels sorry for him when people laugh, is a testament to how bloody nice she is. If it had been me, I'd have been screaming the whole time, laughed along with the congregation and pushed him off Dontos's back as soon as I had the chance.

My own courage has not yet been tested in a situation like that. And seeing a parent murdered like that is the worst imaginable that can happen to a child, any of Sansa's other experiences pale compared to that. Sansa has done nothing she needs redemption or.Being or staying the holy saint of the story would make her thoroughly boring Of course Tyrion has made some heroic choices. He is the deconstruction of a hero in the books, with all his sins, flaws and crimes. And none of the other potentially "heroic" characters will be the perfectly recontructed heroic character in the end. (people often choose to call it "redeemed", I do not like the religious connotation of it and apart from that, no dead child will live, stand up and walk because the hero has "redeemed" himself)All characters will stay flawed, no matter what deeds they will have done to save mankind, they are human and Tyrion is one of the most human with about the biggest presence itn the books.And, yes I want to see the dark sides of Tyrion in the series. They have a great actor in Dinklage and should make extensive use of his abilities.

Basically, they just detail what Tyrion did.Also, about Sansa not need a redemption arc doesn't mean she is the holy saint of the story, in how Ned, Davos, Brienne, Bran, Catelyn, Jon, Sam, and Barristan all don't really need one either.  Moreover, even through she is the darkest Stark I would question if Arya needs one either. Quite frankly, the only people needing redemption arcs are probably Jaime, Theon, and Tyrion.

1677	Woman of War	2013-05-23	I have no wish to deny those, sometimes really minor, sins but of course they are taken out of context. As I said, they are necessary events for Martin  to define the character Tyrion and do not the least little bit diminish my being interested in the character, so why should I play your game and give lengthy reinterpretations from my point ov view? This has been done in x threads, waste of space. And "rape definition posts" are disliked by mods. But  of course you are entitled to dislike the literary character Tyrion and to evaluate events in a different manner than I do.
I do not need to fight for any "moral improvement" for the character Tyrion in order to allow myself to be interested. I root for Tyrion to have a compelling, fascinating story. Not for redemption, since no redeption will wake up Shae - or the Miller's boys murdered by Theon or the murdered cousin of Jaime (definitely "blackwashing" here by the show). I want a reconstruction of characters, I want Martin to make their story "whole", rounded, not necessarily fulfiiling the moral expectations an unknown amount of posters may have in them since the author is not in the wish fulfilling business, but he writes a story with edges and thorns.
 And, coming back to the topic of this thread: None of these events had any influence on Sansa's outlook on Tyrion since some of those things have not yet happened at that point of the story or Sansa simply cannot know about them.

And remember tyrion is just as shallow if not more.At least she is not a  jerk about her taste like tyrion.Honestly after I read tyrions lines about Lollys I never fealt sorry for him that beautiful women don't want him and don't look past his appearance. After all neither does he.

Moreover, the thing that I find most interesting about Tyrion is his greyness in how he is Tywin's son thus open to evil but he still tries to good most of the time. Thus, he demonstrates a strong duel dynamic of balancing good and evil within him where sometimes he is mini-Tywin and other times he is perfectly honorable.However, the fact that show has stripped that away so he is only honorable just bores me now and moreover I find it frustrating that they repeatedly go out of their way to make him even more of a hero so we will supposedly like him more.  Especially, as this has had some negative repercussions on how other characters are seen by some fans.Finally, an equal number of events that people praise Tyrion for Sansa cannot have any idea about either thus they cannot influence her outlook on him anymore then those negative acts.

Why is he allowed to want a beautiful woman but she isn't allowed to want a handsome man?the purpose of my arguments about him being a lannister is only to dispel the ridiculous notion that somehow this marriage is just as miserable for tyrion as it is for Sansa.  That's just inarguable.  She certainly has other reasons, and Tyrion has reasons to loathe this marriage as well, some shallow,some not.  Tyrion hasreasons, some shallow, some not.  Point being, they should never garner similar sympathy nor should anyone expect Sansa to "come around".  It's not realistic.If tyrion says something along the lines of, "Lets take a bkat full of my fathers gold and sail the the Jade sea and never se a Lannister again, I want to love you and blah blah" perhaps I could see an argument as to how she might come around, but he offers to bring her to Casterly Rock.  I feel for Tyrion, forced to marry someone that will hate him forever, but I feel much worse for Sansa for being forced to marry her into the family that slaughters hers and holds her captive.  If tyrion ever inherited the north, csn you imagine what northerners would think of Sansa?   She'd eclipse Theon as the greatest traitor the north has ever known.  Tyrion can  still whatever he wants as a man in a married relationship in westeros seems to he able to do.

Because that just shows how much tyrion keeps promises.I cannot fault Sansa for not be able to trust tyrion especially since if tyrion would have know she wants to get away I am not sure he would have done the things you write there. Or rather I am pretty sure tyrion wouldn't have helped Sansa like that. After all tyrion wanted Winterfell. If Sansa gets away he can't have it. Him not consimating the marriage doesn't mean he gave up, he just postponed it.

1686	Ser Pounce FTW	2013-05-23	is it really possible that you quoted all those posts of mine and happened to miss that in 3 posts its confirmed that THE FIRST thing she says before the paragraph you selected to quote is that SHE THINKS "ANYONE BUT A LANNISTER".  thats the first and most important thing she thinks of.  This invalidates your entire argument. That feeds into my jamie lannister point that I made ajd you said its contradictory, which it isnt. Id appreciate if you'd read the entirety of my posts and what they are responding to and maybe respond there.Of course I read all of your post. Why wouldn't I? It is specifically to your statement of She thinks anyone but a Lannister that I commented on, so how can you claim I didn't read it? And of course my argument isn't invalidated by that statement. Let's review the scene and put it in the context the author used, shall we?My lady, this is no way to bring you to your wedding. I am sorry for that. And for making this sosudden, and so secret. My lord father felt it necessary, for reasons of state. Else I would have cometo you sooner, as I wished." He waddled closer. "You did not ask for this marriage, I know. No morethan I did. If I had refused you, however, they would have wed you to my cousin Lancel. Perhaps youwould prefer that. He is nearer your age, and fairer to look upon. If that is your wish, say so, andI will end this farce."I don't want any Lannister, she wanted to say. I want Willas, I want Highgarden and the puppies andthe barge, and sons named Eddard and Bran and Rickon. But then she remembered what Dontos had toldher in the godswood. Tyrell or Lannister, it makes no matter, it's not me they want, only my claim. "You are kind, my lord," she said, defeated. "I am a ward of the throne and my duty is to marry asthe king commands." He studied her with his mismatched eyes. "I know I am not the sort of husbandyoung girls dream of, Sansa," he said softly, "but neither am I Joffrey." "No," she said. "You werekind to me. I remember."Sansa is given a choice of Lannisters but says she doesn't want either man. She wants Willas. Again, she doesn't think abut what the Lannisters have done to her but of the idyllic lifestyle the Tyrells used to convince her to agree to the marriage. No one blames Sansa for this decision. Who wouldn't choose the fantasy of Highgarden over the reality of King's Landing, especially given the version of it that Sansa has experienced? But she isn't thinking I hate the Lannisters and I don't want anything to do with them. She's thinking I want the fantasy of Highgarden and again, it is logical for her to want that.When we look at the kneeling moment:His uncle's part went less well. The bride's cloak he held was huge and heavy, crimson velvet richlyworked with lions and bordered with gold satin and rubies. No one had thought to bring a stool,however, and Tyrion stood a foot and a half shorter than his bride. As he moved behind her, Sansafelt a sharp tug on her skirt. He wants me to kneel, she realized, blushing. She was mortified. Itwas not supposed to be this way. She had dreamed of her wedding a thousand times, and always she hadpictured how her betrothed would stand behind her tall and strong, sweep the cloak of his protectionover her shoulders, and tenderly kiss her cheek as he leaned forward to fasten the clasp. She feltanother tug at her skirt, more insistent. I won't. Why should I spare his feelings, when no one caresabout mine? The dwarf tugged at her a third time. Stubbornly she pressed her lips together andpretended not to notice. This is all about Tyrion. Sansa is distraught and lashes out at the only person she can and she understands fully that this is a message about her anger and despair but it is directed at Tyrion for not being what she wanted and hoped for. It is a fuck you to Tyrion, who she tells twice that he has been kind to her just moments before this happens. It is not defiance but it is a petulant protest and is viewed that way by all in attendance as they begin to laugh. Most importantly, it is a fuck you to Tyrion, not the Lannisters. This is just a literal summary of the text, not an interpretation infused with what I might want from the scene.

And this still doesnt show that my jamke argumejt is contradictory.
1688	Winter's Knight	2013-05-23	And what's wrong with her making it about her groom? Seriously.
1689	Darth Zyroth	2013-05-23	Sansa is given a choice of Lannisters but says she doesn't want either man. She wants Willas.

But she isn't thinking I hate the Lannisters and I don't want anything to do with them. She's thinking I want the fantasy of Highgarden and again, it is logical for her to want that.I disagree. She says she doesn't want ANY Lannister. But why not want them? Well, because of the way they have treated her, and how they killed her family, and are still trying to kill the little family she has left. She hates them, and that has been stated many times before. She doesn't need to mention the reasons why she doesn't like the Lannisters every time she thinks about them, she clearly knows the reasons. And she doesn't have to be telling us those reasons all the time, we already know them. Any Lannister is terrible for her. Lannisters in general are terrible for her. She prefers Willas and Highgarden because they are not the ones who killed her family, because they have treated her nicely, and because they are offering an scape from her suffering. But then she remembers what Dontos told her. She sees that Tyrells just like Lannisters. Tyrells will just care about her claim, not about her. That means that they will be lying to her just like Lannisters did at the begining, and that they won't care about her well-being, just about what they can gain from her. She sees that it would be just another prison of a different sort. So she accepts the only thing she can do. And she chooses Tyrion over Lancel because at least he has done something for her. Tyrion (the nicer) would be the better choice for her, not Lancel (the prettier).This is all about Tyrion. Sansa is distraught and lashes out at the only person she can and she understands fully that this is a message about her anger and despair but it is directed at Tyrion for not being what she wanted and hoped for. It is a fuck you to Tyrion, who she tells twice that he has been kind to her just moments before this happens. It is not defiance but it is a petulant protest and is viewed that way by all in attendance as they begin to laugh. Most importantly, it is a fuck you to Tyrion, not the Lannisters. This is just a literal summary of the text, not an interpretation infused with what I might want from the scene.Yes, but you are ignoring one part:His uncle's part went less well. The bride's cloak he held was huge and heavy, crimson velvet richlyworked with lions and bordered with gold satin and rubies. No one had thought to bring a stool,however, and Tyrion stood a foot and a half shorter than his bride. As he moved behind her, Sansafelt a sharp tug on her skirt.

Stubbornly she pressed her lips together andpretended not to notice."no one cares about mine". Nobody cares about her. So she is not going to care about anybody, either. And since her groom is the only person she has near and she has to care at the moment, then she is definitely not going to do it. She is mean to him since is the only person she can be mean at the moment. It's not personally at Tyrion for being her future husband, it's because she has decided to not care about anybody. Not kneeling is the way she shows everyone that she is not going to care about anybody, just like no one cares about her.

1690	Zman1863	2013-05-23	And what's wrong with her making it about her groom? Seriously.I don't think the argument is that there is anything wrong with what she did; she was justified in making things as uncomfortable as possible for everyone involved.  It's that her action is being falsely characterized as some sort of calculated act of political protest.
1691	Winter's Knight	2013-05-23	I don't think the argument is that there is anything wrong with what she did; she was justified in making things as uncomfortable as possible for everyone involved.  It's that her action is being falsely characterized as some sort of calculated act of political protest.It wasn't calculated but it was an act of protest. :/
1692	silentwanderer	2013-05-23	Tyrion is the most important of the "cripples bastards and broker things" that are the heroes of the story.I just don't see any reason to demonize Tyrion in order to make Sansa look "better". She doesn't love him, that's it for me.Tyrion could be a saint or a demon and his wife would never love him any more than he loves her.

It's that her action is being falsely characterized as some sort of calculated act of political protest.That's the thing though. She's making things as uncomfortable as possible for Tyrion. Not everyone involved. It wasn't a political protest is was a petulant act. Look at the wording:Stubbornly she pressed her lips together and pretended not to notice.That's not political or house allegiance or anything else. But she does realize this herself:When Sansa turned, the little man was gazing up at her, his mouth tight, his face as red as her cloak. Suddenly she was ashamed of her stubbornness.
1694	SerMixalot	2013-05-23	How is Slapping Shae, Giving the Antler Men to Joff, His views on Lollys Stockworth,Threatening and possibly raping the indentured servant in Pentos, Raping the slave in Selhorys, and Slapping Penny written the worse possible way?  Basically, they just detail what Tyrion did.Also, about Sansa not need a redemption arc doesn't mean she is the holy saint of the story, in how Ned, Davos, Brienne, Bran, Catelyn, Jon, Sam, and Barristan all don't really need one either.  Moreover, even through she is the darkest Stark I would question if Arya needs one either. Quite frankly, the only people needing redemption arcs are probably Jaime, Theon, and Tyrion. The very fact that there are so widely different interpretations of Book Tyrion is sort of the definition of a gray character.
1695	Lady Lea	2013-05-23	That's the thing though. She's making things as uncomfortable as possible for Tyrion. Not everyone involved. It wasn't a political protest is was a petulant act.

But she does realize this herself:When Sansa turned, the little man was gazing up at her, his mouth tight,his face as red as her cloak. Suddenly she was ashamed of her stubbornness.She wants to make it difficult for Tyrion because she was crying through the whole wedding and everyone pretended not to notice. If he has trouble putting a Lannister cloak on her shoulders, I think she's entirely justified in pretending not to notice, or don't you agree? It's her way of saying 'fuck you' in that situation, and even then she kind of feels bad for him later.
1696	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-23	The very fact that there are so widely different interpretations of Book Tyrion is sort of the definition of a gray character.Exactly.  Complaining that HBO Tyrion is a different character than book Tyrion is dependent upon how each of us viewed the character of book Tyrion.	I have a higher opinon of book Tyrion than do some others, so I don't see the HBO portrayal as being any different than I'd imagined.  That's largely based on subjective views that really can't be proven one way or the other.

It's her way of saying 'fuck you' in that situation, and even then she kind of feels bad for him later.It's possible to engage in an act that you know is right, while still feeling badly that someone got hurt in the process.  But you wouldn't be ashamed for having engaged in that right action.Sansa didn't just feel bad for him later.  Sansa was ashamed at her own actions right as she was still up there.  The action that so many people see as "right" is something that Sansa herself sees as wrong.

1698	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-23	"no one cares about mine". Nobody cares about her. So she is not going to care about anybody, either. And since her groom is the only person she has near and she has to care at the moment, then she is definitely not going to do it. She is mean to him since is the only person she can be mean at the moment. It's not personally at Tyrion for being her future husband, it's because she has decided to not care about anybody. Not kneeling is the way she shows everyone that she is not going to care about anybody, just like no one cares about her.That's being nasty to your children or spouse because your boss was mean to you.  It's not admirable, it's not justified, and its something about which decent folk are ashamed when they've realized what they've done.As Sansa was.
1699	Lady Lea	2013-05-23	Exactly.  Complaining that HBO Tyrion is a different character than book Tyrion is dependent upon how each of us viewed the character of book Tyrion.	I have a higher opinon of book Tyrion than do some others, so I don't see the HBO portrayal as being any different than I'd imagined.  That's largely based on subjective views that really can't be proven one way or the other.Well, you see, the thing is that in the books Tyrion did good things and bad things, and everyone could weigh that for themselves and decide what they thought of Tyrion. When you take out all the bad he has ever done so far and you leave only the good (sometimes even changing the bad for more good), then you do have a different character, but interpretations imo will not be conditioned on how one viewed him in the book, because now he is basically all-white, and it's like half his character and personality are missing.
1700	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-23	Honestly after I read tyrions lines about Lollys I never fealt sorry for him that beautiful women don't want him and don't look past his appearance. After all neither does he.That's true.  It's one of the things that makes him not a paragon of virtue.  However, I think it's worthwhile noting that Tyrion did not say that to her face, and did nothing to hurt Lolly's feelings.  Nor do I belief that he would have ever been cruel to her face, which is the positive side of his personality.
1701	Lady Lea	2013-05-23	That's being nasty to your children or spouse because your boss was mean to you.  It's not admirable, it's not justified, and its something about which decent folk are ashamed when they've realized what they've done.As Sansa was.I disagree. Tyrion was one of the people who put her in that situation, he doesn't care about how she feels or that she's crying (he probably thinks it's alllll because he's a dwarf). She has every right to lash out against him.
1702	Darth Zyroth	2013-05-23	That's being nasty to your children or spouse because your boss was mean to you.  It's not admirable, it's not justified, and its something about which decent folk are ashamed when they've realized what they've done.As Sansa was.Yes, and she was ashamed after. But Tyrion did play a part, too. He wasn't being nice to her, and didn't care about her feelings, either. He didn't even ask her nicely to kneel, he just tugged her dress. He is included in all those who didn't care about her. He is part of that "no one". Therefore she is not going to care about him. She is not going to care about anybody, just like no one (including Tyrion) cares about her.

1703	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-23	I feel for Tyrion, forced to marry someone that will hate him forever, but I feel much worse for Sansa for being forced to marry her into the family that slaughters hers and holds her captive.	I don't think being married to someone who hates you is objectively worse than being married to someone you hate.If tyrion ever inherited the north, csn you imagine what northerners would think of Sansa? She'd eclipse Theon as the greatest traitor the north has ever known.Funny -- I see this completely reversed.  I think Northerners would feel tremendous pity for the poor Stark girl who saw her family murdered and was forced to marry the Imp at age 12.  I can't fathom anyone blaming her for that.  And I think Tyrion would be hated with a passion by the North for being part of that family, and for daring to think he could ever be the "Lord of Winterfell."  He'd likely find himself friendless and hated in a frozen land completely foreign to him, and likely on guard against assassins /rebellions 24/7.I also think that his ability to keep a whore out in "town" (which barely exists in Winterfell) would be nearly impossible as well.  It's the type of thing where any girl he patronized might find herself given the old "collaborator" treatment by the rest of the people.Still, I can understand why some folks might feel more sorry for Sansa, and others for Tyrion.  What I really can't fathom is the dogmatism that rejects absolutely even the possibility that Tyrion has gotten it worse.

1704	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-23	Not to mention, when Sansa doesn't kneel Tyrion is just tugging at her dress like she's beneath him
He doesn't automatically politely ask her ''could you please kneel for me'' no he's fucking tugging at her damn dress, at her forced wedding, why the hell should she kneel down for him, I liked this act of defiance.
however, it just wouldn't have worked in this scene due to the way they have handled both characters, perhaps if he, in the show, had just tugged on her dress it would have worked, but because so much of sansa's chapters of internal monologue rather than actions, this specific action would have looked quite jarring to the majority of viewers who haven't read the books to have the kinder, nicer tyrion politely ask sansa to kneel only for her to just stand stock still ignoring him.
also joffrey taking away the stool was the act of cruelty towards tyrion here, even more so taking away this moment from sansa.
i hate how they have to make her character 'nicer' because although she's nice in the books, she's still a wolf.
1705	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-23	Yes, and she was ashamed after. But Tyrion did play a part, too. He wasn't being nice to her, and didn't care about her feelings, either.That's not my reading of the chapter.  Read it again, and read his conversation with her prior to the ceremony. He didn't even ask her nicely to kneel, he just tugged her dress.Because it is the middle of the ceremony and he's not supposed to be saying something out loud that would be overheard.  He tries the tug as gentle reminder to her that he needs help.  I can see the argument that he should have spoken instead, but I don't think him trying to keep it low key is a black mark on him.  Sorry.He is included in all those who didn't care about her. He is part of that "no one". Therefore she is not going to care about him. She is not going to care about anybody, just like no one (including Tyrion) cares about her.Except that's not what she was thinking.  That's the entire point:"You did not ask for this marriage, I know.  No more than I did.  If I had refused you, however, they would have married you to my cousin Lancel.  Perhaps you would prefer that.  He is nearer to your own age, and fairer to look upon.  If that is your wish, say so, and I will end this farce........He studied her with mismatched eyes.  "I know I am not the sort of husband young girls dream of, Sansa," he said softly. "But neither am I Joffrey.""No," she said, "You were kind to me.  I remember."That's what she is thinking immediately before walking down the isle, so she does know that Tyrion cares about her feelings.  Then she gets up at the alter, gets petulant, and takes it out on the one person she knows was kind to her.  Then it's like the laughter wakes her up, and she realized that what she is doing is hurting the wrong person and amusing her true enemies.  So she feels ashamed of that, and then kneels.It's a good moment for her precisely because she recognizes the immaturity of her act.

1707	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-05-23	Sansa should've channeled her Arthur Dayne and replied "My knees do not bend easily." Or was that Doran Martell (GOUT JOKES).
1708	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-23	You may like it, but Sansa herself was ashamed of it.That doesn't matter. She is a young girl that's been brought up to put politeness as one of the most important things in life. The act itself, at the time is important, because her reaction to it later is also important. It shows she can be defiant, show defiance, but she is also compassionate.
1709	Ser Pounce FTW	2013-05-23	The act itself, at the time is important, because her reaction to it later is also important.It shows she can be defiant, show defiance, but she is also compassionate.Stubbornly she pressed her lips together and pretended not to notice. That isn't defiant. This is defiant:  Stubbornly she pressed her lips together and stared him in the eye.
1710	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-23	Well, you see, the thing is that in the books Tyrion did good things and bad things, and everyone could weigh that for themselves and decide what they thought of Tyrion. When you take out all the bad he has ever done so far and you leave only the good (sometimes even changing the bad for more good), then you do have a different characterYou're right that removing some actions changing the ability of the audience to weigh all that themselves.  But I don't think they've taken out all the bad he's ever done, and further, I think we might well disagree quite strongly as to how "bad" some of those actions really were.  Some of the "bad" that has been listed really doesn't bother me at all.Rather, I think they've taken out stuff that really wouldn't have changed my personal opinion anyway.  So he's not a different character to me, though I can't really say those who feel he is different are wrong.  It all depends on how you saw him in the first place.
1711	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-23	That doesn't matter. She is a young girl that's been brought up to put politeness as one of the most important things in life. The act itself, at the time is important, because her reaction to it later is also important.It shows she can be defiant, show defiance, but she is also compassionate.The text doesn't say she felt sorry for Tyrion.  The text says she felt ashamed of her own actions.  Those are not the same things at all, because a person who does the right thing that has a side effect of hurting the wrong person might feel compassion for that person, but they're not going to feel ashamed of the act.
1712	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-23	Stubbornly she pressed her lips together and pretended not to notice. That isn't defiant. This is defiant:  Stubbornly she pressed her lips together and stared him in the eye.Well, you're wrong. It is an act of defiance TO SANSA. at the time. The text doesn't say she felt sorry for Tyrion.  The text says she felt ashamed of her own actions.  Those are not the same things at all, because a person who does the right thing that has a side effect of hurting the wrong person might feel compassion for that person, but they're not going to feel ashamed of the act.But she is a young girl who is confused and brought up into a world where politeness and courtesy is very important, so in this case, even though she felt ashamed of the action herself, I don't think that's enough evidence to just say the action was wholly wrong.

They don't need or have to, but that doesn't mean they can't. I don't remember the part in the books where such thing is stated. He could perfectly have asked nicely and treat her as his equal, as his bride, instead of tugging at her dress an treating her like if she was inferior. You are just making up rules and excuses. Sorry.Except that's not what she was thinking.  That's the entire point:"You did not ask for this marriage, I know.  No more than I did.

So she feels ashamed of that, and then kneels.She says "You were kind to me". "were". During an specific moment, not that he is always kind to her or that he is being kind to her now. And don't forget that now Sansa has trusting issues, especially when it comes to Lannisters. Whenever Tyrion did something nice to her, she thought "Is he really being nice to me? or is he mocking me? is he just acting? The Queen and Joffrey used to be nice to me too" (or something along those lines). She doesn't truly believe herself that he is nice to her just for being nice. She even questions it, and kind of finally accepts it in the Eyrie. And besides, during the ceremony, while she's crying, Tyrion doesn't do anything that shows he is being nice to her or cares about her. It's a good moment for her precisely because she recognizes the immaturity of her act.She realizes it. But it also shows that she is stubborn, wild, a wolf, and a Stark. And it shows that she is not going to care or make things easily for those who don't care about her.
1714	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-05-23	Lyanna Stark is stubborn, wild, and wolf like. Sansa is just a victim who's fed up of being shit on. There's a huge difference there. All humans have some defiance in them. Please stop with the whole Sansa = Wolf thing.

All humans have some defiance in them. Please stop with the whole Sansa = Wolf thing.Why should we stop? Everytime Sansa tries to be strong she thinks "I'm a Stark of Winterfell" and "I must be strong, like Robb" She is trying to be strong, keep her pride, and act like a Stark. And she gets her strengh from thinking about her family, House, and name. Those Sansa moments of stubborness and strengh are very "Wolf thing".

1717	Ser Pounce FTW	2013-05-23	Well, you're wrong. It is an act of defiance TO SANSA. at the time.But she is a young girl who is confused and brought up into a world where politeness and courtesy is very important, so in this case, even though she felt ashamed of the action herself, I don't think that's enough evidence to just say the action was wholly wrong.I'm wrong? And you're right? And then you go on to say there not enough evident that the action was wholly wrong? Just partially wrong?Any evidence of this? Because the text says she was stubborn and then she was ashamed. Who is ashamed of being defiant? The whole point of defiance is to say "No!" Who is ashamed of that? But pressing one's lips together and saying "I can't see you" that's not defiant. It's easy to be ashamed of that.It would seem you are angry at Sansa's situation as well you should be. But that doesn't mean you can rewrite what's actually written.

1718	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-23	No, you're wrong to rewrite a sentence an to say that the books version is wrong and your version is right for defiance. It only matters if it was to sansa the character and her act, at the time, was an act of defiance on her behalf.

But that doesn't mean you can rewrite what's actually written.But for Sansa, a girl who's been always taught to obey, and do what is asked from her, not obeying is an act of defiance. She is still a hostage, and was just recently threatened of being beaten if she refuses or argues. She cannot say "NO!" or start screaming. So she is being defiant and stubborn in the little way she can. Just ignoring him, and not kneeling, not doing what is asked or expected of her is an act of defiance TO Sansa. It may not seem like defiance to you, but IT IS TO HER.edit:spelling

1720	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-23	That's not my reading on the chapter. Read it again.I quoted the part of the text where she specifically acknowledged that he was nice to her.  If you want to quote text from that Chapter saying he was never nice to her, please feel free.What? How do you know they are not supposed to say anything?Because the ceremony calls for the husband to put the cloak around the wife, and I don't think "please kneel down because I can't reach" is part of the wedding script any more than tugging on her dress is.  Six of one, half dozen of the other.They don't need or have to, but that doesn't mean they can't. I don't remember the part in the books where such thing is stated. He could perfectly have asked nicely and treat her as his equal, as his bride, instead of tugging at her dress an treating her like if she was inferior.Well, you see tugging on her dress as evidence of superiority, and I don't.  I've been in weddings and similar events where people are supposed to do certain things, and if people aren't lined up correctly, the communication to correct that may just as often be non-verbal as not.   Depending on circusmtances, one may be less intrusive/obvious to onlookers.You are just making up rules and excuses. Sorry.I'm saying there is no evidence that the non-verbal communication of tugging on the dress is any worse than verbal communication telling her to kneel.   Neither is part of the wedding script, so I'd cut spur of the moment decisions some slack.She doesn't truly believe herself that he is nice to her just for being nice.I'm not sure how you can know that given she actually states that he was being nice.And besides, during the ceremony, while she's crying, Tyrion doesn't do anything that shows he is being nice to her or cares about her.Doesn't say that he noticed or was even in a position to notice.  Anyway, I personally think the way he spoke to her before the ceremony was kind, so if you read it differently, I don't suppose that's a difference of opinion that can be resolved.Whenever Tyrion did something nice to her, she thought "Is he really being nice to me? or is he mocking me? is he just acting? The Queen and Joffrey used to be nice to me too" (or something along those lines).Not true.  For example, in that same chapter, she specifically recalls one of her beatings and thinks:It had been the Imp who had saved her from a beating that day, the same man who was waiting for her now.  He is not so bad as the rest of them, she told herself.  "I'll go."And when she remembers that he was kind to her, it is not accompanied by her thinking "is he really being nice to me".  She was legitimately grateful for it.

1723	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-05-23	Why should we stop? Everytime Sansa tries to be strong she thinks "I'm a Stark of Winterfell" and "I must be strong, like Robb" She is trying to be strong, keep her pride, and act like a Stark. And she gets her strengh from thinking about her family, House, and name. Those Sansa moments of stubborness and strengh are very "Wolf thing".She wants to be strong, sure, and her idea of strength comes from her older brother and father. That is a characteristic any younger child has, at least one that respects their parents. It has nothing to do with being a wolf, it's just about maturing and not pitying one's self. Lyanna Stark wouldn't need to remind herself "I must be like Brandon and be brave" because she's a fucking wolf. It is her wild instinct that defines her nature. Sansa does not possess this at all.Why? She herself often associates herself with Winterfell and her family. What matters if one is to say she's a wolf, meaning, she's still a Stark. And they're an old and proud house.Because every house is old and proud to some extent. Of course she associates herself with Winterfell, but she doesn't exhibit any characteristics that are unique to the wild-wolf, defiant type. Every noble lady is proud. Aren't you the same people who were all talking about how Sansa is so much like Ned who is so unlike Brandon and Lyanna?

1724	Jacob17	2013-05-23	Break Marillion's FingersBe amused at his father murdering Masha HeddleWanting the entire Vale to burn because of Lysa and Cat, when he knows that his sister and brother were behind Bran's attempted murder.Slapping ShaeGiving the Antler Men to JoffLetting his Wildlings loose to rape and kill in KLPoisoning CerseiKidnapping Tommen and being prepared to rape him if necessaryHis views on Lollys StockworthBeing part of the forced marriage to SansaKilling ShaeThreatening and possibly raping the indentured servant in PentosRaping the slave in SelhorysSlapping PennyThank you for this list, this is really helpful for my understanding of the story.  I had to reread several of these incidents.  My interpretation of many of them is different than yours. Marrillion:  Tyrion stepped on and broke a few fingers moments after saving the guy's (and his own) life.  He was lashing out at someone who had taken up with his captors and had been harrassing him.  Tyrion also told the guy to STFU which probably saved his life again.Burning the Vale:  Lysa was trying to frame him for her own murder.  Cat bought LF's story hook line and sinker largely because it is so easy to believe that an "Imp" would do such a thing.  I can understand him wanting to get back at them.  Of course, he doesn't actually burn the Vale.Poisoning Cercei: LaxativeTommen: He kidnapped him to protect him and was never going to rape him.  He made a convincing bluff to protect Shae. Shae:  Damn if he didn't love her, risk everything for her, and do everything he could do to protect her.  Tyrion is one of the few romantics in the story.  Shea betrayed him in such a cruel way that I have a hard time feeling sorry for her.  She was conspiring with Cercei and Tywin to have Tyrion murdered.  The whole trial was such a farce.  Actually, both of his trials were complete farces. I'm trying to think, has anyone else in the story been forced to stand trial for a murder he didn't commit?  Off the top of my head I can't think of anyone.  He killed someone he once loved who had betrayed him and was helping having him killed.  Not quite self defense, since Shae was asleep and had likely been compelled to testify to some extent, but its close.  This is a tough one.  I'm sure it will haunt Tyrion for the rest of his life.  He could have just as easily sucked it up, left her there, and hoped she wouldn't have been able to harm him any further. Bad Shit That Someone In His Family Actually Did: I don't think its fair to judge Tyrion by the acts of Tywin, Jamie, Cersei and Joffrey.  You can't control who your family is.  Tyrion is the only person who stands up to them.  Its unreasonable to expect him to stand up to them every single time they do something cruel.  This also cuts to the heart of the major dillema facing Tyrion throughout the series.  His family is cruel, but if he was not born into this family he would likely be an early victim of infanticide, best case scenario he gets to be a travelling mummer. We see him struggle with this.  He tries to guide his family to the light at times, tries to stand up to them at times, and other times he shuts his mouth deciding to pick his battles.  When all of this fails he finally gives up deciding that even slavery and mummery is better.  I don't recall Masha at all, but I'm sure that whatever Tywin did to her was awful and cruel and that Tyrion would have been a more just person if he had scolded his father instead of being amused. Lollys:  The joke to his father about prefering his cock being fed to goats was not a nice thing to say.  He should have defended and protected a fellow Cripple, Bastard, and Broken thing like he did for Jon, Bran, Varys, Sansa, and Penny.  The fact that we are even considering that he should have said something nice about Lollys speaks volumes as to Tyrion's decency.   Penny:  Hitting her was awful. The next time revisit Dance I will take another look at the incidents in Pentos and Selhorys.  I seem to remember the threat in Pentos being a bluff to get her disdainful eyes away from him.  I don't remember a rape in Selhorys at all.  Shame on me. I think you have missed the boat on the Darry Castle incident in Game completely.  Sansa's silence was a complete betrayal of Arya and Nymeria.  She was young, but so was Arya.  She should have been protecting Arya instead of calling her horseface and helping condemn her.  Thats why Lady died.  My gut tells me that Sansa will come around and embrace her inner wolf, but her behavior at the wedding clearly shows she is not there at that point.
1725	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-05-23	I don't remember a rape in Selhorys at all.  Shame on me.I believe people are referring to the whore that was bought for Viserys who Tyrion notices regards him with disgust so he tells her something like keep your mouth shut and your legs spread and we'll get along just fine.
1726	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-23	I believe people are referring to the whore that was bought for Viserys who Tyrion notices regards him with disgust so he tells her something like keep your mouth shut and your legs spread and we'll get along just fine.There's a sex slave he rapes, vomits all over and then rapes again. She isn't a whore, she's a slave. Tyrion sees all the whipping scars on her skin, realises what he has done, realises it's wrong and then continues to vomit all over her and rape her again. That's why people bring it up because it really is one of the worst things tyrion does.

I think it really is his absolute low point.  But I actually think they might skip it because it was a really repulsive scene, and he'll already be pretty damn dark after the PW.  By the time he gets to Selhorys, I think he's mentally unhinged, and that rape scene is just over the top.
1729	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-05-23	For some reason I don't remember that, but yeah, no way they show that on TV.
1730	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-23	For some reason I don't remember that, but yeah, no way they show that on TV.I actually had forgotten about it too until a few weeks ago.  I think what happened for me is that Tyrion's turn after the PW was so dark that it all kind of ran together, and I truly considered him mentally unbalanced at the time.  He really was a completely different character at that point.  I also thought his treatment of Penny was detestable, but I hope they keep at least some of that in there.
1731	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-23	Definitely.  I think it really is his absolute low point.

Maybe the vomit and 'taking her' again, but someone's worst acts need to be shown. However, it's not exactly a scene that would afford me any pleasure in watching, so it's not like it would really offend me if they didn't include it. However, I'd expect them to believably show his downward spiral through more than him just crying and drinking, because then people would just feel sorry for him again, where I think at this point in the series we're supposed to feel both sympathy AND absolute disgust at what he's become. I actually had forgotten about it too until a few weeks ago.  I think what happened for me is that Tyrion's turn after the PW was so dark that it all kind of ran together, and I truly considered him mentally unbalanced at the time.  He really was a completely different character at that point.  I also thought his treatment of Penny was detestable, but I hope they keep at least some of that in there.I agree that he was mentally unbalanced, I don't think it's right to just say ''ahh that makes him a different character'' it doesn't. He's still Tyrion, that's why it's so horrific, he's a broken, depressed Tyrion, but it shows what he is capable of in his darkest moments, which is what makes his character so interesting, he can be disgusting, repulsive, and commit acts that I consider pretty evil, but he is also the man that made a saddle for the little cripple boy so he could ride a horse again. He's very complex, to eliminate any or most of his disgusting acts, or to just blame it on him being soooo depressed that he's a different character kind of diminishes that. BTW, depression doesn't turn someone into a completely different character, it's just their lowest, lowest points.
1732	mrs_serpounce	2013-05-23	Not to mention, when Sansa doesn't kneel Tyrion is just tugging at her dress like she's beneath himHe doesn't automatically politely ask her ''could you please kneel for me'' no he's fucking tugging at her damn dress, at her forced wedding, why the hell should she kneel down for him, I liked this act of defiance.however, it just wouldn't have worked in this scene due to the way they have handled both characters, perhaps if he, in the show, had just tugged on her dress it would have worked, but because so much of sansa's chapters of internal monologue rather than actions, this specific action would have looked quite jarring to the majority of viewers who haven't read the books to have the kinder, nicer tyrion politely ask sansa to kneel only for her to just stand stock still ignoring him.also joffrey taking away the stool was the act of cruelty towards tyrion here, even more so taking away this moment from sansa.i hate how they have to make her character 'nicer' because although she's nice in the books, she's still a wolf..... wow. Vehemence. Actually, there's a different way to read that: Tyrion could be tugging at her dress because he doesn't want to ask out loud in front of everyone and make it a bigger embarrassment for the both of them. There's this thing in upper-echelon society (especially medieval upper classes) that is about not speaking such things aloud, so it may be that he thought by just quietly and surreptitiously tugging on her dress (because it's Sansa's POV, we don't see if his hand is hidden or not to do so, we just know she feels it) so that it can save them both some embarrassment. It's not about "automatically asking politely," that's a construct of *our* time. And men back when wouldn't have "automatically asked politely," they would've ordered their women to do something if they were really jerks, and the women would've obeyed.... so there's that.Just a different idea of a read.Well, you're wrong. It is an act of defiance TO SANSA. at the time.This is the part I'm not getting with all of these discussions. Instead of saying, "I'm sorry, I disagree, I don't see it that way," it's "Well, you're wrong" or "That doesn't matter" when someone brings up something straight out of a text read. How is it when the text is black and white there, that someone is wrong, or that it can be dismissed straight out of hand? It's the *text.* Interpreting text involves taking into account everything that's said, not just dismissing the parts you don't like.Not all the Sansa defenders are like this, but I'm seeing a lot more of it in them than those who are attempting to paint Tyrion in even a *neutral* light. People are being dismissed out of hand, no matter how well-reasoned and well-thought-out the argument; fact is, it seems that no statement that doesn't wholly defend Sansa is ever going to even get a "well, we're going to have to agree to disagree."Kudos to those who actually debate. I'm sorry to those who despise Tyrion and don't think he's worth even calling gray. As Former Lord said, we all have our interpretations of the characters. I'm sorry that we can't all discuss it without resorting to cursing and huffing at those who disagree.
1733	mrs_serpounce	2013-05-23	What? How do you know they are not supposed to say anything? They don't need or have to, but that doesn't mean they can't. I don't remember the part in the books where such thing is stated. He could perfectly have asked nicely and treat her as his equal, as his bride, instead of tugging at her dress an treating her like if she was inferior. You are just making up rules and excuses. Sorry.Please read up on the time that GRRM is basing ASoIaF on. I've done a wide bit of reading on both the Wars of the Roses and the Tudors, and sorry (and as a woman, boy does it make me sorry to know this) women were *not* equals; not even remotely so. This scene can be read, as I pointed out in a recent post, as them saving embarrassment in a forum where it was not societally acceptable to do so. IMNSHO, even having Tyrion ask in the TV show is an anachronistic product of our more feminist times. A more likely scenario, in that instance: a husband could be a total dick and just order his wife to kneel. (Joff would've.) Tyrion didn't do that. You can read that as he was trying to be quieter about it to save some face for both of them.But you know. Tyrion's awful'n'stuff and Sansa is the Princess of Westeros. /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />
1734	mrs_serpounce	2013-05-23	No, you're wrong to rewrite a sentence an to say that the books version is wrong and your version is right for defiance. It only matters if it was to sansa the character and her act, at the time, was an act of defiance on her behalf.He quoted the passage exactly as-is. I don't see how that's a rewrite. If you interpret it differently, obviously, that's your interpretation. But it's your interpretation of what's going on in Sansa's head, while others read it differently.
1735	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-23	I don't think it would be over the top to show him with the dead-in-the-eyes sex slave, and to show all her whipping scars.

That really pissed me off, personally, because unlike some one-time, drunken molesting of a slave that could be explained as singular reality break, it's a conscious, deliberate bit of cruelty over an extended period of time.I agree that he was mentally unbalanced, I don't think it's right to just say ''ahh that makes him a different character'' it doesn't. He's still Tyrion, that's why it's so horrific, he's a broken, depressed Tyrion, but it shows what he is capable of in his darkest moments,I guess we disagree there.  I see Tyrion as not just revealing a darker facet of his personality, but actually snapping.  He still is the same physical person, obviously, but I think the break is sharp enough that's its not just a matter of personality.  At least, for a period of time after he leaves Westeros, probably cumulating in the rape.  He's still a nasty bastard after that, but he's no longer off his rocker.

1736	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-23	snipI'm not a 'sansa defender' don't reduce me and attach me to one character. I'm a fan of a lot of the characters. I only said ''you are wrong'' because they said it was not an act of defiance, which it was, to sansa. i don't know what your problem is, a few times now you have replied to my posts in threads insinuating im some sort of hysterical fan or just really patronised me, which i don't appreciate. i might not agree with everything FLOW says but at least i don't get the impression he's deliberately patronising whilst exasperatedly rolling his eyes. Why?I guess I just see it as important that if you are going to show a morally ambiguous character's best and kindest deeds then it's also important to show his most hideous. I think they can get there with him killing Shae and Tywin, being far more debauched than usual (perhaps throwing up on whores rather than beaten slaves), and by being nasty to Penny, who will likely garner a lot of sympathy.  That really pissed me off, personally, because unlike some one-time, drunken molesting of a slave that could be explained as singular reality break, it's a conscious, deliberate bit of cruelty over an extended period of time.Yeah, I kinda agree with a lot here actually, they can get away with him just throwing up on whores and genuinely acting pretty disgusting. I also hated his attitude towards Penny too, it's very important they capture this relationship like it is in the books, when the show eventually catches up, because it's a good reflection of how Tyrion views another dwarf. But not only that, a young girl who is very naive, very lovely and very innocent, and he's actually quite cruel to her at times, even though he also feels ashamed of this.I guess we disagree there.  I see Tyrion as not just revealing a darker facet of his personality, but actually snapping.  He still is the same physical person, obviously, but I think the break is sharp enough that's its not just a matter of personality.  At least, for a period of time after he leaves Westeros, probably cumulating in the rape.  He's still a nasty bastard after that, but he's no longer off his rocker.Well, I don't necessarily disagree, I also think he has snapped, it's just important to say he is the same character, but he has snapped, otherwise it sounds like blaming some horrible acts all on his mental state, removing all blame from him when he does commit these acts. I do, however think he did completely snap, but he's also aware after the slave incident of what he does, he realises it's wrong, and so should we.
1737	HopeForSpring	2013-05-23	.... wow. Vehemence.

1738	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-23	I guess I just see it as important that if you are going to show a morally ambiguous character's best and kindest deeds then it's also important to show his most hideous.Well, my point is that in an adaptation, a lot of stuff necessarily needs to be cut.  You might not address every nuance of a character, but you do want to be sure the main points get across.  And you have to be careful that the visual adaptation actually translates with the same impact as it does in writing.  Essos is full of even worse abuses than Westeros -- slavery in particular, but D&D can't paint that context as well as GRRM does in the books.  And sometimes seeing things is a lot worse than just reading about them.  So, I think that scene would actually have a disproportionate impact when shown as opposed to when written, and that might actually distort perceptions of the character.To give an example, I read and saw "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo."  And though I read the book just fine, I had to walk out of the theater during the rape scene.  I just couldn't handle it.  I could read what Tyrion did, but I know I couldn't watch it.  And that means it's a different impact.  So anyway, I just hope they show his moral collapse without that particular scene.Well, I don't necessarily disagree, I also think he has snapped, it's just important to say he is the same character, but he has snapped, otherwise it sounds like blaming some horrible acts all on his mental state, removing all blame from him when he does commit these acts. I do, however think he did completely snap, but he's also aware after the slave incident of what he does, he realises it's wrong, and so should we.No, I still think he gets blamed, or punished.  But I'll admit -- I do not judge him for that slave rape the same as I would if what happened to him after the PW hadn't happened.  It's still wrong, and still evil, but I also think what has happened to him is relevant to the degree of guilt I assign.

1739	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-23	I swear I've repeated, on many occasions, that I never intend to demonize Tyrion and always, always accepted and even made mention of his good deeds aswell as the bad, so I don't appreciate being labelled a 'sansa defender' which I'm not, and then a 'Tyrion hater' which I don't think is necessarily true. 
The importance is how characters feel,  Sansa when she is at her forced wedding getting her dress tugged by the man shes being forced to marry is NOT thinking ''well poor him hes only doing this because he doesnt want to be embarrased and he cant reach me'' she's miserable, she's probably not even feeling much at this point emotionally, she doesn't need to feel for him. But she does feel ashamed of what she does, which shows she is compassionate.
1740	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-23	Well, my point is that in an adaptation, a lot of stuff necessarily needs to be cut.  You might not address every nuance of a character, but you do want to be sure the main points get across.  And you have to be careful that the visual adaptation actually translates with the same impact as it does in writing.  Essos is full of even worse abuses than Westeros -- slavery in particular, but D&D can't paint that context as well as GRRM does in the books.  And sometimes seeing things is a lot worse than just reading about them.  So, I think that scene would actually have a disproportionate impact when shown as opposed to when written, and that might actually distort perceptions of the character.To give an example, I read and saw "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo."  And though I read the book just fine, I had to walk out of the theater during the rape scene.  I just couldn't handle it.  I could read what Tyrion did, but I know I couldn't watch it.  And that means it's a different impact.  So anyway, I just hope they show his moral collapse without that particular scene.I'm fine with them not showing that scene as long as they show him acting at his lowest, like you suggested, maybe throwing up over a whore instead. He has to be shown at his most pathetic state, and they can achieve this without putting that scene in out of no where. I agree there needs to be a descent. No, I still think he gets blamed, or punished.  But I'll admit -- I do not judge him for that slave rape the same as I would if what happened to him after the PW hadn't happened.  It's still wrong, and still evil, but I also think what has happened to him is relevant to the degree of guilt I assign.I agree then. What happens to him is relevant, I don't think he ever would have committed this act had he not been in that mental state.
1741	Wouter	2013-05-23	I disagree. Tyrion was one of the people who put her in that situation, he doesn't care about how she feels or that she's crying (he probably thinks it's alllll because he's a dwarf). She has every right to lash out against him.Indeed. In the books, tyrion is participating willingly, does not even tell sansa in advance that she has to marry him (a terribly unkind thing to do to your future bride) and he is going into the marriage planning to rape her. In the show however, tyrion is more clearly ordered himself (instead of being persuaded), he has the grace to personally tell sansa herself (showing respect) and he stops the bedding way earlier. So, i like show tyrion's actions way better here and i like it that they also changed sansa's attitude somewhat to reflect that.I don't mind a whitewashed tyrion; it makes it easier to root for the character. Allthough i generally like book tyrion, he acted cruel to sansa until the moment he decided not to go ahead with consommation. That sansa was cold to him was well deserved, after he had ambushed her along with the rest of the lannisters.
1742	Minsc	2013-05-23	Regarding the whole cloaking issue within the books as compared to the show, there is a subtle action in the show that demonstrates book:Tyrion lack awareness to her feelings in the led up to the cloaking ceremony.  Simply, why didn't book:Tyrion as someone who knew about the wedding beforehand and likely knows what happens at weddings make any neutral preparations for the cloaking ceremony?
Simply, book:Tyrion could have equally as show:Tyrion brought with him a stepping chair to the ceremony beforehand thus having that ready to stand on so he could perform the cloaking ceremony.  Thus, saving Sansa the humiliation of having to kneel and him the humiliation of having to stand on someone's back therefore being a neutral unoffensive option for both parties.
Yet, for someone reason he decided to negate thinking ahead thus forcing her and him in a stand off where one would have to relent to further humiliation.  Only bad luck for him, Sansa decided she wasn't going to have any of that thus forcing the humiliation onto Tyrion rather then passively accepting it for herself.
Simply, if he ,as a mature adult, took any responsible precaution then none of that mess would have happened.  Instead, he seems to have just expected that she would passively accept further humiliation rather be defiant to his desires.

1743	Zman1863	2013-05-23	Wouldn't you think it would be just as likely that the idea to have a footstool present would have simply slipped his mind?
1744	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-23	Indeed. In the books, tyrion is participating willingly, does not even tell sansa in advance that she has to marry him (a terribly unkind thing to do to your future bride) and he is going into the marriage planning to rape her.Tyrion argued against the marriage, and knew that if he didn't marry her, she'd be forced to marry someone else.  He is forbidden by his father from telling her ahead of time, and since she's under guard 24/7, he doesn't have much choice.  Under Westerosi law and custom, it's not rape.Allthough i generally like book tyrion, he acted cruel to sansa until the moment he decided not to go ahead with consommation. That sansa was cold to him was well deserved, after he had ambushed her along with the rest of the lannisters.   The exact text of all the stuff he told her prior to the wedding already has been posted, so perhaps you'd like to copy those conversations and explain what in them you believe to be "cruel".Oh, and after the ceremony, King Joffrey orders Sansa to be stripped prior to the bedding so everyone can see her naked, and the men all present cheer.  Tyrion then risks his own life by threatening to cut off Joffrey's cock if he strips off her clothes.  Risking his life to prevent Sansa's humiliation is just more cruelty by Tyrion, I suppose.The actual bedding has been covered exhaustively, so I'm not going to bother.  But the idea that Tyrion was "cruel to her" prior to the bedding is, IMHO, completely unsupported by the text.
1745	Wouter	2013-05-23	Tyrion argued against the marriage, and knew that if he didn't marry her, she'd be forced to marry someone else.  He is forbidden by his father from telling her ahead of time, and since she's under guard 24/7, he doesn't have much choice.Tyrion is also forbidden by his father to take Shae to KL, and he does it anyway. Sansa being under guard didn't stop her making wedding arrangements with the Tyrells (and giving info on Joffrey's true character) and making escape arrangements with Dontos, all under the Lannisters noses. Surely someone as capable as Tyrion could have found a way to warn her, even if he wouldn't dare go against his family directly by openly telling her.Tyrion argued against the marriage - and then let himself be persuased by Tywin and Kevan to do it anyway, apparently because Winterfell+Sansa didn't look like a bad proposal even if it made him slightly uneasy. If he really didn't want to take part, he could have left with Shae to the free cities (as show-Shae proposed) or have called Tywin's bluff on using Lancel instead. Ironically, the outcome with - bedridden and guiltridden - Lancel would likely have been much the same as he didn't bed his bride either, in the end. Anyway, telling Tywin to find someone else to do his dirty work (have sex with a 12-year old against her will and against the express wishes of her family, after he had promised "not to savage her") would have absolved Tyrion from guilt, but he got persuaded. The exact text of all the stuff he told her prior to the wedding already has been posted, so perhaps you'd like to copy those conversations and explain what in them you believe to be "cruel".The cruel part is that he promised not to savage her, only to then be part of the Lannister-team (side-by-side with Cersei, Joffrey, Tywin, Kevan, Ser Meryn and other such illustrious company) that ambushed Sansa to get her out of her Tyrell wedding (which she had agreed to after the Tyrells asked it) and into a wedding at swordpoint. The cruel part is that he was fully planning to consummate the marriage and went as far as to have her strip completely. The cruel part is that he took advantage of the explicit and implicit threats made to Sansa by Cersei and Joffrey (being beaten, being dragged screaming to the altar etc.). The cruel part is that he took part in a marriage that cemented Sansa's status as a Lannister captive for the rest of her life (note that Sansa still couldn't move freely after the marriage; she still had to sneak out via hidden exit, to be able to escape).Given this context, I think his disappointment about Sansa not kneeling is silly. The whole marriage was based on the idea that Sansa has no agency and that she would be made to obey, so if he wanted her to kneel he should have ordered her and have her beaten if she did not comply. That was the way the marriage was supposed to work, it was never about consent of Sansa, it was about forcing her. His disappointment that she didn't trust him or did not really want to talk to him, as his wife, is similarly silly after the stunt(s) the Lannisters had pulled on Sansa. It's a pity for Tyrion he participated in that last stunt, the marriage-by-ambush.Oh, and after the ceremony, King Joffrey orders Sansa to be stripped prior to the bedding so everyone can see her naked, and the men all present cheer.  Tyrion then risks his own life by threatening to cut off Joffrey's cock if he strips off her clothes.  Risking his life to prevent Sansa's humiliation is just more cruelty by Tyrion, I suppose.No. It's one of the reasons I generally like book-Tyrion anyway, root for him (to prosper A!nd to be a better man than he sometimes is) and don't mind this more clearly sympathetic version of him in the show. OK, a villain as main character to be rooted for worked in The Sopranos, but I in the setting of a mafia story I think this is more acceptable than in a show that used to have Ned Stark as the main character.
1746	mrs_serpounce	2013-05-23	I'm not a 'sansa defender' don't reduce me and attach me to one character.I'm a fan of a lot of the characters.I only said ''you are wrong'' because they said it was not an act of defiance, which it was, to sansa.i don't know what your problem is, a few times now you have replied to my posts in threads insinuating im some sort of hysterical fan or just really patronised me, which i don't appreciate.i might not agree with everything FLOW says but at least i don't get the impression he's deliberately patronising whilst exasperatedly rolling his eyes.You spend a whole lot of time being offended at your perception of my perception of you instead of reading the rest of what I write. I could ask you the same question - "I don't know what your problem is" - but then I would consider that patronizing."Fucking tugging at her damn dress" is vehemence. If you had said "he's repeatedly tugging at her dress, and I consider that demeaning," that's not vehemence. You cursed, twice, in the same sentence, and you've been repeatedly defensive when someone doesn't agree with you. I haven't painted you as hysterical, that's your own perception; however, since the first time you've posted, I've always considered your posts to hold a highly impassioned tone. If you don't want to leave that impression, you might want to consider how you phrase things, just as I'm considering how I phrase them now.Also, as to "you are wrong": he is wrong, in your perception of the text. That is your interpretation of what Sansa feels. Others have a different interpretation, and have elucidated it repeatedly. It may seem like simple semantics to you, but it's not semantics when being considerate of the feelings of others.You've read a very negative tone in many of my posts since the very first one I made (in which I asked you to not engage in capslocking - which was interpreted, again, as me patronizing, rather than asking you for common Internet courtesy), and called me rude more than once. You've ignored or outright dismissed the wide majority of arguments that have been made (while also posting a lulz pic that was meant as sarcasm), and again, instead of agreeing that our interpretations are different, you fall back on "I am right, and you are wrong."I'm sorry if you feel that's me being patronizing. I'm just calling it like I see it. I certainly don't feel morally superior; I'm just asking that it be brought back to what it is, a discussion of opinions, rather than it being about who's correct or incorrect. The only person that's correct on any of this, IMNSHO, is GRRM. The rest of us are all just trying to figure it out. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />

1747	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-23	Tyrion is also forbidden by his father to take Shae to KL, and he does it anyway. Sansa being under guard didn't stop her making wedding arrangements with the Tyrells (and giving info on Joffrey's true character) and making escape arrangements with Dontos, all under the Lannisters noses. Surely someone as capable as Tyrion could have found a way to warn her, even if he wouldn't dare go against his family directly by openly telling her.Not sure that's the kind of thing you'd tell through a messenger.  And, we really don't know how long between Tywin ordering the marriage and the actual marriage is.Tyrion argued against the marriage - and then let himself be persuased by Tywin and Kevan to do it anyway, apparently because Winterfell+Sansa didn't look like a bad proposal even if it made him slightly uneasy. If he really didn't want to take part, he could have left with Shae to the free cities (as show-Shae proposed) or have called Tywin's bluff on using Lancel instead.The point was that Tyrion could not save Sansa from being married involuntarily no matter what, and in the end, Sansa didn't want Lancel because she recalled that Tyrion had been the one who protected her from a beating.  It was making the best of a bad situation not of his own making.The cruel part is that he promised not to savage her, only to then be part of the Lannister-team (side-by-side with Cersei, Joffrey, Tywin, Kevan, Ser Meryn and other such illustrious company) that ambushed Sansa to get her out of her Tyrell wedding (which she had agreed to after the Tyrells asked it) and into a wedding at swordpoint.I don't think that fits the definition of "cruelty" at all on Tyrion's part.  It's not his fault that Tywin is a controlling prick.  It was not his idea to stop the Tyrell wedding, he argued to his father against it, and in the end, agreed because there really wasn't a better alternative for either himself or Sansa.  The only thing he could have done for Sansa was refuse in favor of Lancel, and in fact, rather than making that decision himself, he left that choice to Sansa.  Who chose him.The cruel part is that he was fully planning to consummate the marriage and went as far as to have her strip completely.Sorry, I don't see that as cruel either.  It was entirely in accordance with the customs of the time, and even Sansa knew that.  I previously linked the email from GRRM himself where he explained that whole issue, including the age that bedding maidens (girls who had flowered) was not considered wrong or perverse, and that noble girls in particular tended to be bedded at younger ages.  You can call that rape or savaging or whatever you want, but that is applying 21st century standards to a place where they absolutely do not belong.  In the best analogy you get -- the middle ages -- the church recognized the age of marriage/consummation under canon law as 12 for females.the explicit and implicit threats made to Sansa by Cersei and Joffrey (being beaten, being dragged screaming to the altar etc.).This is just ridiculous -- you're now accusing Tyrion of cruelty for acts committed by his hated sister and nephew, for which he wasn't even present.  Pointless to continue.

1748	Wouter	2013-05-23	Tyrion let Cersei and Joffrey make the threats that made Sansa go along - Sansa would not have married him without the threats and the physical restraint (she was running when Cersei's maid catched her). That's taking advantage of their actions. Tyrion was planning to bed a girl who didn't want him, whose family didn't approve of the marriage at all and she wasn't even told about it until she was dragged to the altar at swordpoint. That's no more OK, even by Westerosi standards, then the "marriage" between Ramsay Bolton and lady Hornwood, or the "marriage" between "Arya" and again Ramsay. Catelyn and Robb very firmly did not find it "OK". Sansa did not find it "OK". Even Tyrion did not think it "OK" when it came time to actually do it. As for Lancel, Sansa didn't want Lancel but she didn't want Tyrion either. And his "choice" was a false one; he supposedly gave her the "choice" after the wedding guests were already assembled and certainly after Joffrey and Cersei had ordered and threatened her that she would marry Tyrion, or else.Joffrey and Cersei said "we command you to marry the loathsome imp!", they did not qualify by "or you may choose to marry another Lannister of your choosing, even though we have told all the waiting guests already that it is Tyrion". Tyrion had no authority to give her a choice, the King had decided and so had Tywin who organised the whole thing. What would he have done if Sansa said Lancel, call the entire thing off while Lancel gets well enough to rise from his sickbed?
1749	Ser Pounce FTW	2013-05-23	Well, you're wrong. It is an act of defiance TO SANSA. at the time.Could you quote the text that shows that it is defiance to Sansa?No, you're wrong to rewrite a sentence an to say that the books version is wrong and your version is right for defiance.Where did I say I was saying the book version is wrong? It is precisely the book version I've been referring to: She is stubborn and then ashamed. She does not defy Tyrion and she does not defy the Lannisters. If I am incorrect please point out where the text states this.Also, where did I say this is my definition of defiance? The Merriam Webster definition of defiance:1 the act or an instance of defying: Challenge2 willingness to contend or fightMeaning of defying:1 to challenge to do something considered impossible: Dare2 to confront with assured power of resistancePlease note the verbs: challenge, fight, challenge, dare confront. Sansa is none of these things during her wedding but she has shown these traits with Joffrey so Sansa understands defiance very well: "Maybe my brother will give me your head." There is no way this sentence can be seen as anything other than defiance and she is challenging and fighting with her words and look. And she wasn't ashamed after she said it. Rather, she considered pushing Joffrey off the walk to his death. She wasn't ashamed of that thought either.It only matters if it was to sansa the character and her act, at the time, was an act of defiance on her behalf.Could you please show me where Sansa shows she has a different definition of this word? I know you want her to be defiant and she is sometimes but she wasn't here.This is the part I'm not getting with all of these discussions. Instead of saying, "I'm sorry, I disagree, I don't see it that way," it's "Well, you're wrong" or "That doesn't matter" when someone brings up something straight out of a text read. How is it when the text is black and white there, that someone is wrong, or that it can be dismissed straight out of hand? It's the *text.* Interpreting text involves taking into account everything that's said, not just dismissing the parts you don't like.Thanks for the defense mrs_serpounce but I'm used to it when it comes to Sansa fans.
1750	Lady Lea	2013-05-23	Indeed. In the books, tyrion is participating willingly, does not even tell sansa in advance that she has to marry him (a terribly unkind thing to do to your future bride) and he is going into the marriage planning to rape her.In the show however, tyrion is more clearly ordered himself (instead of being persuaded), he has the grace to personally tell sansa herself (showing respect) and he stops the bedding way earlier. So, i like show tyrion's actions way better here and i like it that they also changed sansa's attitude somewhat to reflect that.Yes you are quite right - they did change the scene in many different ways, and Sansa also wasn't crying (although she did look quite stunned) and Tyrion had the decency to bring a stool with him (even if Joffrey did take it away) and iirc he asked her to kneel instead of pulling on her cloak like she was a dog. I'm glad they at least let the "and if I never want you?" line though.
1751	JonCon's Red Beard	2013-05-23	This is just not true. Sansa can know that it was Tyrion who protected her when Joffrey tortured her and everyone else around did nothing but watching.Sansa, by the time she's about to get married, still believed on fairy tails. She was sure she would have her dreamy happy ending, marrying a Tyrell, having kids with him, living in Highgarden, being a lady and many other stuff. She didn't get that the Lannisters would never let her go so easily. And then, she realises they are humiliating her once more by marrying him to the dwarf everybody hates because of her name and rights.IICR, a few times Sansa has remembered herself that Tyrion helped her and she probably wouldn't have a problem with him in the everyday life. But marrying him is way different because in his mind, he's a Lannister and all of them are Lannisters, the family that killed his father, mother and brother. She doesn't know the relationship he has with his father and sister, nor she cares. They all could be confabulating against her as fas as she knew.So, of course she resented that marriage, despite how much of a "good guy" Tyrion tried to be with her, he's the one that made her return to reality, not her fantasy world.
1752	Raksha the Demon	2013-05-23	Tyrion let Cersei and Joffrey make the threats that made Sansa go along - Sansa would not have married him without the threats and the physical restraint (she was running when Cersei's maid catched her).

What would he have done if Sansa said Lancel, call the entire thing off while Lancel gets well enough to rise from his sickbed? /agree.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':agree:' />Book-Sansa was given only the choice of being dragged to the altar or walking to marry a member of the family that killed her father and was warring against her mother and brothers while holding her captive.  Book-Tyrion was given the choice of marrying Sansa and siring the heir to Winterfell on her and becoming Winterfell's lord through her or marrying a much less attractive female.  Tyrion could have chosen not to be a party to Sansa's continued abuse and told his father to draft another Lannister to grab Winterfell through a 12-year-old girl.  But he didn't.  I understand that Tywin is the head of House Lannister and Tyrion feared him and also owed him allegiance; but it's unlikely that he would have been thrown out in the streets to starve if he had refused to marry Sansa.  Book-Tyrion wanted Winterfell through marriage to a pretty young girl; it was too tempting an offer to refuse.  So I don't feel sorry for the character of Tyrion.  I do feel sorry for the character of Sansa, who was forced to marry a Lannister, and then had to face a husband who allowed her to strip naked on their wedding night and told her he desired her even though she was a child.As for book-Sansa's refusal to kneel, I think the debate about whether or not it was defiance is pretty much splitting hairs.  She wanted to show that she was not acquiescing; and whether her motive was revulsion at being forcibly married to a dwarf or to a Lannister, or both, book-Sansa was conveying, by the refusal to kneel, her reluctance and lack of agreement.  She had been warned that the marriage would happen even if she was dragged to the altar.  One could call her refusal to kneel the only protest she believed she could make.The TV version of Tyrion & Sansa's wedding took a different tack.  I don't think that showing Sansa's refusal to kneel would have worked well, given that she had at least a few days' notice rather than a few minutes; and I think the directors wanted her to embody nervousness, shock and numb misery rather than protest.  We should probably be glad that they let TV-Sansa summon up some nerve at the end and ask 'and if I never want you?'...
1753	JonCon's Red Beard	2013-05-24	One could call her refusal to kneel the only protest she believed she could make.Indeed, BUT neither in books or show, people know her pov about it, so, any of the guest of the wedding, or Joffrey or Cersei could probably interpret it as she's so stupid that she doesn't know that she's supposed to kneel instead of some act of "defiance".
1754	Woman of War	2013-05-24	Sansa, by the time she's about to get married, still believed on fairy tails. She was sure she would have her dreamy happy ending, marrying a Tyrell, having kids with him, living in Highgarden, being a lady and many other stuff.

Of course she resented the marriage, I would never expect her to come to terms with it after five minutes of disdain and be happy, for sure not.she realises they are humiliating her once more by marrying him to the dwarf everybody hates because of her name and rights.This is certainly part of Tywin's plan: Humiliation, not because of herself, Tywin does not care about Sansa as person, but he wants to humiliate the whole Stark family by giving their daughter or sister to that despised cripple. Joffrey, on the other hand clearly enjoyed the humiliation of both Tyrion and Sansa.She doesn't know the relationship he has with his father and sister, nor she cares. They all could be confabulating against her as fas as she knew.there is some truth in it and she is terrified and does not know anymore whom to believe. But it shows a slight lack of self confidence from Sansa's side that she does not probe by seemingly harmless, childlike innocent questions how far Tyrion's loyalty to his family might reach - well, after the wedding, when she had seen that he won't rape her. Youth is not always a disadvantage in the game, it can be cleverly used to one's favor. But then, as you wrote, she is brutally shocked by having been pushed out of her fantasies and emotionally and mentally rolls into fetal position.So, of course she resented that marriage, despite how much of a "good guy" Tyrion tried to be with her, he's the one that made her return to reality, not her fantasy world.i absolutely agree

1756	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-24	Tyrion let Cersei and Joffrey make the threats that made Sansa go along...Tyrion wasn't in a position to "let" Cersei or Joffrey say anything.   They said what they bloody well wanted regardless of Tyrion's wishes.  And in fact, in the scenes where Cersei threatened Sansa, and then when Joffrey did the same, Tyrion wasn't even present.  Your bias doesn't even let you see that.The one time Tyrion was present when Joffrey threatened Sansa with respect to the wedding -- when he ordered her stripped publicly --  Tyrion drew his dagger and threatened to cut off Joffrey's cock.At this point, you're not even arguing the text -- you're just arguing your feelings and making shit up.

1757	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-24	One could call her refusal to kneel the only protest she believed she could make.Well, not exactly. There was speculation previously that if Sansa had made a scene or some kind of statement, she'd have been taken away, beaten severely, and then forced to go through with the wedding anyway.  But that's not what the text says.  According to the text -- which is Sansa's POV -- the only consequence of her refusing to go through with the wedding was not a beating -- it was just that she was going to be married and bedded even if she decided to "struggle and scream and make a spectacle."  That's the only threat that was made to her, and there is no textual basis in her own chapter supporting the assertion that she thought she'd be beaten if she made any kind of protest.Which means that if she'd have, at any time, spoken up/screamed in protest during the ceremony to state her opposition to the wedding, to condemn them for killing her father, or whatever, there's no suggestion she'd have been beaten.  They'd simply have continued the ceremony anyway despite her screaming and making a spectacle of herself.  That's the exact threat made to her, nothing more.   And in fact, when she did talk back to Joffrey by saying "you''re not, you'll never be" when he claimed to be her father prior to walking her down the aisle, no beating again.  And obviously, she wasn't beaten and there were no repercussions from her refusal to kneel (if you take that as defiance) either.Now, maybe Sansa's personality was such that she didn't want to make a spectable of herself, but that's her choice to say nothing and place being ladylike over speaking her mind or protesting.  The claim that the "only" protest she believed she could possibly make is not kneeling, is not supported by the text.  It's just that it is the only protest she chose to make.Also, there isn't any textual support for the claim that Sansa didn't or couldn't distinguish between Lannisters, such that there really wasn't any difference between Joffrey, Cersei, and Tyrion.  In that chapter, she specifically acknowledges twice, just in that one POV chapter, that she does recognize the difference.  First, right after being told she will marry him, and before even seeing him, without any prompting, she recalls being saved by him from a beating and thinks  "He is not so bad as the rest of them".  And then later, when he tells her he knows he is not a dream husband, and that she does not want this wedding, he says "but neither am I Joffrey", and she responds, No, you were kind to me.  I remember."  The claim that Sansa had no reason not to lump them all together is belied by Sansa herself.  Nor is there the slightest hint in her own POV that she disbelieved Tyrion's claim that he didn't want the marriage either, or that she believed he was secretly in cahoots with his sister and the King.  If Sansa's doesn't think that in her own POV chapter, then what is the textual basis for saying she actually believed that?What I really can't fathom about this discussion is why those who so love Sansa want to ignore all that.  It is a sign of maturity on Sansa's part that she doesn't lump all the Lannisters together.  That's what an immature kid might do.  Her being able to separate out Tyrion's past kindness towards her, and not lump him together with all of them, speaks well of her growing maturity.  All the claims that "for all she knew he was in cahoots with them, etc..", have no textual support, and diminish her accurate perception of the situation.That's not to say she should be happy about marrying him.  She shouldn't be, and Tyrion tells her as much.  But the Chapter does suggest that Sansa, at least, understands who the real villains are here.

1758	brashcandy	2013-05-24	Sansa, by the time she's about to get married, still believed on fairy tails. She was sure she would have her dreamy happy ending, marrying a Tyrell, having kids with him, living in Highgarden, being a lady and many other stuff. She didn't get that the Lannisters would never let her go so easily. And then, she realises they are humiliating her once more by marrying him to the dwarf everybody hates because of her name and rights.So being determined to make a good life with your future husband despite the less than favourable circumstances leading up to the marriage means that she still believes in fairytales? Because she pictures puppies in her lap? I guess good marriages don't exist anywhere in Westeros huh? Sansa would not have seen her parents in love, or known of any other happy couple. The pregnant woman and her husband that Tyrion sees at Joffrey's wedding were just a mirage.IICR, a few times Sansa has remembered herself that Tyrion helped her and she probably wouldn't have a problem with him in the everyday life. But marrying him is way different because in his mind, he's a Lannister and all of them are Lannisters, the family that killed his father, mother and brother. She doesn't know the relationship he has with his father and sister, nor she cares. They all could be confabulating against her as fas as she knew.Of course it's way different in her mind. She knows that Tyrion is a Lannister who worked tirelessly up to the Blackwater battle to keep his despot nephew in power. Why should she care what relationship Tyrion has with Cersei and Tywin? It doesn't prevent him from going along with Tywin's schemes; it doesn't stop Cersei from coming to threaten her on the day of the wedding. So, of course she resented that marriage, despite how much of a "good guy" Tyrion tried to be with her, he's the one that made her return to reality, not her fantasy world.Oh this is rich. Wasn't Tyrion the one claiming he could be the Knight of Flowers in bed? If there's anyone who wanted Sansa to have a fantasy view of their marriage and his role as her husband, it was Tyrion Lannister.
1759	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-24	So being determined to make a good life with your future husband despite the less than favourable circumstances leading up to the marriage means that she still believes in fairytales? Because she pictures puppies in her lap?Yes.  The puppies thing is a bit ham-fisted on GRRM's part, but the point is pretty clear about her still thinking in terms of fairy tales prior to the wedding.  Shit, she doesn't even want to go back to Winterfell.  She actually hopes her husband will forget Winterfell.  She wants to go to beautiful, warm, sunny Highgarden instead, with the puppies and the barge.  Really, the beginning of that POV Chapter is almost a flashback to AGOT Sansa, including her "giggling" about her wedding dress.  So yeah, fairy tale.  Or at least that's what is seems like to some folks.  Others disagree, and I don't think that's a dispute for which any objective resolution is possible.To her credit, at least IMHO, she recovers pretty quickly after she learns of the switcheroo.  And the key moment is when she suddenly recalls what Dontos told her about there really being no difference between the Lannisters and Tyrells, and she realizes that Highgarden, the puppies and the barge really are just a fairy tale.  It's when she finally snaps out of the fairy tale mindset, however pleasant that might be, and understands the reality in which she is stuck.  Until she did that, and was willing to deal with her situation as it is rather than as she wanted it to be, I think her growth as a person/character was really limited.

1761	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-24	Yes, this is something I ask myself too.

Why is that latter opinion incompatible  with loving Sansa? Why could it be a "negative" approach towards the literary character Sansa to see both sides of the coin? What does it take away from the character Sansa if Tyrion is not seen as her antagonist?As if you could only defend one character at the expense of the other! Is this really a zero sum game in quantification of suffering?Here's what I think is going on.  As soon as you start to defend Tyrion -- or point out that Sansa herself seems to recognize his positive qualities -- her defenders infer that you are also saying that she should be please to marry Tyrion.  Now, the thing is that some people here and elsewhere on the internet are making that argument -- that Sansa is shallow for not appreciating Tyrion's positive qualities, and should be pleased to marry him if only she wasn't an immature twit.  I think that's what those folks hear when some of us defend Tyrion.What is getting missed is that people like you, me, and others here are not saying that.   We're saying --  if I may speak for "our" side -- that Tyrion is a decent guy at this point, that Sansa recognizes this, but that she is nevertheless justified in not wanting to marry him, just as Tyrion is justified in not wanting to marry her.  I mean, of course she doesn't want to marry him.  He's perhaps twice her age and ugly as hell.  Even if he was the nicest guy in the world, she'd still prefer to marry a guy closer to her age, better looking, who also would be a nice guy.  And there's not a damn thing wrong with that.But at the same time, Tyrion legitimately didn't want this marriage, tried to talk his father out of it, and accepted it only when he realized his refusal wouldn't benefit either of them.  Tyrion's story is incredibly sad to me because despite his wealth, all he really ever wanted -- and still wants -- is the poor little crofter's daughter who he thought, for a bit, loved him for who he was.  Not a fairy tale -- just someone poor to love him for himself.  And then Tywin did that.  It's just heartbreaking, and I think that event essentially defined who he was moving forward for the rest of his life.So now Tyrion is presented with this situation.  He's noble enough and considerate enough to argue against it -- he's fully considering Sansa's feelings here.  In fact, her feelings are the very basis for why he speaks against it, on both ends. He knows she doesn't love him and won't want htis marriage, and he doesn't want to be married to someone who feels that way about him.Then he's told that no matter what he does, she's going to be married off against her will to someone of Tywin's choosing, and Tyrion will marry Lollys.  It's that fact that determined Tyrion's acceptance.  So Tyrion thinks to himself that he is not a bad guy.  That he can protect her, that he will be good to her, and that she'll perhaps actually come to see him for who he is someday.  We know this because it is one of the first thing he says to her, "I'm not Joffrey" at the ceremony.  And perhaps there is some truth in that, but it is still a sadly romantic bit of optimism.  He'll be Lord of Winterfell, so he'll have something too, and maybe they can actually have a decent life in timeBut as soon as folks start to defend Tyrion like that, those who are fans of Sansa just hear "she should want to marry him because he's such a great guy", and that simply isn't the case.  You can see things from his perspective, even see things objectively, and still acknowledge that there is not a damn thing wrong with her not wanting to marry him.

I think that's what those folks hear when some of us defend Tyrion.I agree. I think there is a tendency in some to inflate the prevalence of the extreme anti Sansa view of the marriage. That view exists, but it's far from overwhelming. I only know a few unsullied but none of them came away thinking that Sansa should have been happy.
1765	David Selig	2013-05-24	Yes.  The puppies thing is a bit ham-fisted on GRRM's part, but the point is pretty clear about her still thinking in terms of fairy tales prior to the wedding.  Shit, she doesn't even want to go back to Winterfell.  She actually hopes her husband will forget Winterfell.Wait a second - the point of the "he will forget Winterfell when he sees me, I<U+0080><U+0099>ll see that he does." is not that Sansa doesn't want to go back to Winterfell ever, it's that she's hoping Willas would love her for herself and won't just see her as a way to gain the North. It's very clear if you read the end of her previous chapter and her meeting with Dontos.Besides, if she marries Willas, given the situation at the time, the only way to get back at Winterfell is if her family loses the war and control of Winterfell. And Sansa doesn't want that.
1766	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-24	Wait a second - the point of the "he will forget Winterfell when he sees me, I<U+0080><U+0099>ll see that he does." is not that Sansa doesn't want to go back to Winterfell ever, it's that she's hoping Willas would love her for herself and won't just see her as a way to gain the North. It's very clear if you read the end of her previous chapter and her meeting with Dontos.It's both, and she can't have the one without the other.  The only way her husband could ever forget Winterfell is if she never mentioned it, and never went back.  When she dreams of her ideal scenario, she thinks:I don't want any Lannister, she wanted to say, I want Willas, I want Highgarden and the puppies and the barge..."  There's no mention of Winterfell.Besides, if she marries Willas, given the situation at the time, the only way to get back at Winterfell is if her family loses the war and control of Winterfell. And Sansa doesn't want that.Nor does the text show that's she's thinking that geopolitically.  She's just thinking about how wonderfully Highgarden is.  There's no "I just wish I was in Winterfell safe with my family."	She's giggling about how happy she is at the beginning of that chapter.But then, after thinking that and finding out about Tyrion, she recalls Dontos' words about there being no difference between Lannisters and Tyrells.  And as I said, that's when the light bulb goes on, and the fairy tale ends.  So I'm not sure that we really disagree all that much.  I see her as stuck in a fairy tale at the beginning of the chapter, then coming to the realization mid-chapter that is not the case.  She then relapses a bit at the altar, then is ashamed at that behavior.In that chapter, she took some big steps towards growing up.

Of course not. Winterfell was a burned ruin at this point, and there was no chance of her getting there anyway since the Lannisters won't allow it. She wants the more realistic option - the Willas marriage. How is that a sign of fairytale thinking? It could've easily happened.And why wouldn't she be happy when she expect to get out of the KL nightmare, Joff and the other Lannisters?

She's immature.Again, this is right back to a point I made awhile ago.  Any criticism of Sansa seems to be taken as condemnation of her character.  It's not -- it's just a criticism, and a relatively mild one at that.

1771	Sniraga	2013-05-24	May I just say that this debate has been a very interesting read! /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />Here's my $0.02:I have always felt pity for Sansa and Tyrion both, but Sansa's position has seemed more miserable to me, because of her age and her status as a girl in Westeros and as a hostage.Tyrion did behave quite decently (there are many who would have been far more cruel and nonchalant), but he has his limitations too. I got the impression he was somewhat ashamed of his role in the marriage and didn't really want to think it. That was probably the main reason he didn't dare to warn Sansa beforehand, it was easier not to. I get that Tyrion was afraid of his father, but since that didn't stop him eg with Shae, I don't buy that as a reason not to talk with Sansa. To keep the marriage in secret from the bride because it was a matter of state seems like a flimsy cop-out for me. I tend to think he just wanted to apologize and resorted to some excuse that sounded, you know, neutral and harmless.Tyrion clearly understood he wasn't by any means a dream husband to Sansa - because he was a dwarf and a Lannister - but as he also understood the marriage was quite a good deal for him (as far as arranged marriages go) and he wouldn't mind the union as much as Sansa would.He also thought about his ability and willingness to protect Sansa and that too weighed in his decision making. And it's admirable. But one of Tyrion's problems is actually his intelligence. He's a lot cleverer than most of people and this has made him somewhat arrogant. To Tyrion the young and naive Sansa must have seemed to be... well, merely a girl, and someone he could and perhaps even should patronize (in a more positive sense of the word, I guess). So, while he himself did quickly think the marriage through and tried to take Sansa's feelings and hopes in consideration, he didn't deem it important enough to actually discuss the matter with her.I guess this disregard of Sansa the person and Tyrion's own issues with the marriage affected his behavior. He was totally unprepared for the cloak exchange and sort of expected Sansa to just follow through the marriage ceremony like a good, dutiful and polite little girl despite the fact her future plans had just been turned upside down. I can't fault Sansa for lashing out at Tyrion with her refusal to kneel even though the end result was misfired. I can understand the need to get even the smallest of victory and to protest by being stubborn and impolite for a moment. And I admire Sansa for realizing that she was only making Tyrion a laughing stock and feeling ashamed of it. I must also say that Tyrion reacted fairly well (I can't say whether his tugging was impolite or not), but he didn't make himself a jerk by complaining later that Sansa made a fool of him.
1772	Woman of War	2013-05-24	Puppies, yes. She is twelve years old at this point. Twelve- and so she tries to paint as bright a picture as possible. Willa's breeds dogs, so she adds puppies to her mental image.When Sansa thinks of marriage, may it be to Joffrey, Loras or Willas she thinks of parties, picnics, of meeting beautiful people and of nice dresses, a husband who tenderly kisses her cheek. She is not aware at all that marriage is messy, dirty, maybe painful sex, she has no idea about sex, not even vanilla sex, not to speak of the misery - or possible lust - that may go on in Westerosi marriage beds. When she thinks of children she  does not even remotely think of pregnancy and childbirth and the dangers coming with it.The first time she is confronted with this is when she really has to consider the possibility that her marriage might actually be "consummated". This is the first time she realizes that being married is not puppies and parties for women.And, Sniraga, your analysis is great. You have wonderfully pointed out how Tyrion's high intelligence combined with little experience in communication with simply average but socially more functioning people makes him clumsy and insecure in social interaction on an emotional level.

His choices were Lollys or Sansa, and hers were Tyrion or Lancel.  Each was the others better option out of two they were given.

1775	Silverin	2013-05-24	How the hell are puppies immature, fairy tale like?
I am sorry my cousin breads dogs, and there are a lot of puppies there.
You know dogs fuck, because they want to fuck and then puppies are born.
There is nothing unrealistic about them. It is like saying that babies and children are unrealistic and fairytale like.
Guess what, withouth babies there are no adults.
Just like that where are adult dogs you will find puppies as well. And every dog is a puppy at first.
Life isn't just a hell of a dark place, where everything is horrible yada yada. Sansa might be naive, but thinking that everything is dark and there is no happinnes, not even worth dreaming about it doesn'T make someone realist or mature it makes someone pessimist. It is just the other end of the spectrum, it is just as blind of a way to see the world.
EDIT:
when tyrion was a kid he wanted a dragon....
I say asking for puppies is way more realistic and way less naive.
Btw. puppies are not rare or luxury items. Even poor people have dogs, even poor people with horrible living situation have puppies.
Seriously it is like you critises Sansa that she dares to not want to be miserable for he rest of her life...

1776	JonCon's Red Beard	2013-05-24	When Sansa thinks of marriage, may it be to Joffrey, Loras or Willas she thinks of parties, picnics, of meeting beautiful people and of nice dresses, a husband who tenderly kisses her cheek. She is not aware at all that marriage is messy, dirty, maybe painful sex, she has no idea about sex, not even vanilla sex, not to speak of the misery - or possible lust - that may go on in Westerosi marriage beds.When she thinks of children she  does not even remotely think of pregnancy and childbirth and the dangers coming with it.The first time she is confronted with this is when she really has to consider the possibility that her marriage might actually be "consummated". This is the first time she realizes that being married is not puppies and parties for women.In further Sansa's povs she admits that she wouldn't mind to go through the bedding ceremony in another circumstances, being with people who love her and the man she loves. I think that's kinda the point made about her wedding, she was marrying a man she didn't like nor she wanted to marry in front of people who hated her and want to send his brother a message by torturing as much as they could. Also, while the bedding ceremony consist on taking the bride and groom their clothes, the other time when she was through something similar was when Joffrey ordered to get her undress and beat her. If the bedding had gone as ordered by Joffrey, they would take the chance to, once again, make fun of her and his husband, because let's be honest, the image of Tyrion being naked in front of the court is something they definitely would laugh about. So, in her mind, the bedding, when is made by your family and friends is something to enjoy; but for her, surrounded by strangers, was a reminder of how the Lannisters had make her live a living hell, mentally and physically.
1777	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-24	So just to make sure I have this all straight, Sansa isn't immature.  Unless one happens to be arguing against the marriage, in which case she's a "child" who is far too young to be married.I guess that makes her a mature child, or something.
1778	Darth Zyroth	2013-05-24	I quoted the part of the text where she specifically acknowledged that he was nice to her.  If you want to quote text from that Chapter saying he was never nice to her, please feel free.I didn<U+0080><U+0099>t say that he was never nice to her. He was. But he wasn<U+0080><U+0099>t particularly nice or nicer than everybody else during the ceremony (ceremony, I<U+0080><U+0099>m not talking about the feast or bedding). Sansa says that no one noticed her tears, or just didn<U+0080><U+0099>t care. I<U+0080><U+0099>m pretty sure Tyrion should have seen her crying. But he didn<U+0080><U+0099>t do anything to comfort her. Later on, she says that he wasn<U+0080><U+0099>t smiling at all during the whole wedding, he seemed grim and bitter. Tyrion participated in her marriage; he was one of the people who put her in that horrible situation. He didn<U+0080><U+0099>t even really try to tell her, and gave her a choice where both options seemed bad (Tyrion or Lancel) to her. And he gave her the choice after Joffrey and Cersei had told her that she would marry whoever they commanded. That was not truly a real choice.Because the ceremony calls for the husband to put the cloak around the wife, and I don't think "please kneel down because I can't reach" is part of the wedding script any more than tugging on her dress is.  Six of one, half dozen of the other.Neither is <U+0080><U+009C>the bride should kneel for her future Lord husband in case he can<U+0080><U+0099>t reach<U+0080><U+009D>. Sansa mentions that nobody had thought of bringing a stool. This means it was fine to use a stool. Why didn<U+0080><U+0099>t Tyrion think about that knowing his height problem? And if he went out of the <U+0080><U+009C>rules<U+0080><U+009D> to tug her dress, then why not simply ask?Well, you see tugging on her dress as evidence of superiority, and I don't.We<U+0080><U+0099>ll just have to disagree here, I guess. I see it like that because he expected her to kneel for him, during her own wedding.I've been in weddings and similar events where people are supposed to do certain things, and if people aren't lined up correctly, the communication to correct that may just as often be non-verbal as not.   Depending on circusmtances, one may be less intrusive/obvious to onlookers. Well, yes. But just the fact of kneeling is not an usual part of the ceremony. Just the fact that she has to kneel will be obvious. So why not go ahead and ask instead of tugging her dress and expecting her to do it?I'm saying there is no evidence that the non-verbal communication of tugging on the dress is any worse than verbal communication telling her to kneel.   Neither is part of the wedding script, so I'd cut spur of the moment decisions some slack.Sure, there<U+0080><U+0099>s no evidence. But again kneeling is not part of the wedding script either. So IMO asking would be nicer. I<U+0080><U+0099>ve always been told that calling someone is more polite or nicer than pocking that person.I'm not sure how you can know that given she actually states that he was being nice.Yes, she admits he was nice to her in a couple of occasions. But what I mean is that she doesn<U+0080><U+0099>t really understand the reason behind his actions. Sometimes, especially while those acts of kindness were happening, she thinks he is not kind to her just for being nice.Doesn't say that he noticed or was even in a position to notice.He was very close to her during the ceremony. I<U+0080><U+0099>m pretty sure he noticed.Anyway, I personally think the way he spoke to her before the ceremony was kind, so if you read it differently, I don't suppose that's a difference of opinion that can be resolved.I agree that going to talk to her before the ceremony started is nicer than just waiting for her in the wedding. But going to her some days before the wedding would have been nicer. And the conversation itself wasn<U+0080><U+0099>t really that nice. He basically told her with in a better way, and with better words what Cersei and Joffrey had already told her: that she would have to marry a Lannister, no matter what.Not true.  For example, in that same chapter, she specifically recalls one of her beatings and thinks:It had been the Imp who had saved her from a beating that day, the same man who was waiting for her now.  He is not so bad as the rest of them, she told herself.  "I'll go."And when she remembers that he was kind to her, it is not accompanied by her thinking "is he really being nice to me".  She was legitimately grateful for it.What I meant was when some of those acts were happening. For example:Tyrion turned to Sansa. "My lady, I am sorry for your losses. Truly, the gods are cruel."Sansa could not think of a word to say to him. How could he be sorry for her losses? Was he mocking her? It wasn't the gods who'd been cruel, it was Joffrey.Lannister reached out and took her hand, and gave it a squeeze. "I am only a little lion, child, and I vow, I shall not savage you." Bowing, he said "But now you must excuse me. I have urgent business with queen and council."Sansa watched him walk off, his body swaying heavily from side to side with every step, like something from a grotesquerie. He speaks more gently than Joffrey, she thought, but the queen spoke to me gently too. He's still a Lannister, her brother and Joff's uncle, and no friend. Once she had loved Prince Joffrey with all her heart, and admired and trusted his mother, the queen. They had repaid that love and trust with her father's head. Sansa would never make that mistake again.When Joffrey the King<U+0080><U+0099>s guard to strip Sansa naked, and Tyrion appeared she was grateful, but later when Tyrion took her to the Tower of the Hand to rest:The door opened, and Tyrion Lannister stepped inside. "My lady. I trust I am not disturbing you?""Am I your prisoner?""My guest.""You grow very quiet," Tyrion Lannister observed. "Is this what you want? An end to your betrothal?""I . . . " Sansa did not know what to say. Is it a trick? Will he punish me if I tell the truth? She stared at the dwarf's brutal bulging brow, the hard black eye and the shrewd green one, the crooked teeth and wiry beard. "I only want to be loyal."And even in the Eyrie she thinks <U+0080><U+009C>Kind?<U+0080><U+009D>. With an <U+0080><U+009C>?<U+0080><U+009D>. Like if she couldn<U+0080><U+0099>t believe herself.

1779	aedalia	2013-05-24	I'm very interested to see how their dynamic in the show will play out after the RW. In the books she cries in private and IIRC we don't get to see Tyron say it, just the aftermath. I would like to see Sophie act that scene out- there wouldn't be a dry eye anywhere, methinks.
1780	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-24	I didn<U+0080><U+0099>t say that he was never nice to her. He was. But he wasn<U+0080><U+0099>t particularly nice or nicer than everybody else during the ceremony (ceremony, I<U+0080><U+0099>m not talking about the feast or bedding). Sansa says that no one noticed her tears, or just didn<U+0080><U+0099>t care. I<U+0080><U+0099>m pretty sure Tyrion should have seen her crying. But he didn<U+0080><U+0099>t do anything to comfort her. Later on, she says that he wasn<U+0080><U+0099>t smiling at all during the whole wedding, he seemed grim and bitter. Tyrion participated in her marriage; he was one of the people who put her in that horrible situation. He didn<U+0080><U+0099>t even really try to tell her, and gave her a choice where both options seemed bad (Tyrion or Lancel) to her. And he gave her the choice after Joffrey and Cersei had told her that she would marry whoever they commanded. That was not truly a real choice.You have no idea whether he noticed her tears or not, so blaming him for that is just speculative.   And Tyrion wasn't smiling because he didn't want the marriage either.  He was being forced to either marry Sansa, or a catatonic half-wit, so I'm not really blaming him for choosing Sansa, or for feeling miserable at the wedding.  He was entitled to his misery just as much as she was, although he did stand up to protect her feelings when it really counted.  He was as nice to her as circumstances permitted when it began, stood up for her when she was about to be humiliated, and was otherwise in his cups.  Can't say I blame him, and it's not like there's much he could have done to comfort Sansa.  She was getting married, understandably didn't want to, and not much was going to change that.And then in terms of the choices she was given -- yeah, so what?  That's not Tyrion's fault, and his choice wasn't much of one either.  Nobody is saying she didn't have the right to be unhappy, but it sounds as if you're saying he doesn't.  I say they're both entitled to be miserable at a wedding neither of them wanted.

1781	Woman of War	2013-05-24	In further Sansa's povs she admits that she wouldn't mind to go through the bedding ceremony in another circumstances, being with people who love her and the man she loves. I think that's kinda the point made about her wedding, she was marrying a man she didn't like nor she wanted to marry in front of people who hated her and want to send his brother a message by torturing as much as they could. Also, while the bedding ceremony consist on taking the bride and groom their clothes, the other time when she was through something similar was when Joffrey ordered to get her undress and beat her. If the bedding had gone as ordered by Joffrey, they would take the chance to, once again, make fun of her and his husband, because let's be honest, the image of Tyrion being naked in front of the court is something they definitely would laugh about. So, in her mind, the bedding, when is made by your family and friends is something to enjoy; but for her, surrounded by strangers, was a reminder of how the Lannisters had make her live a living hell, mentally and physically.Yes, I remember, this was when she may have been a participant  of the bedding ceremony as wedding guest in Winterfell when she was a child. Although I recall  that she remembered the bedding ceremony as "wonderfully wicked" I doubt that cildren had been allowed to see bride or bridegroom naked, so I think she had never been actually in the room. At least she had never seen a penis erect. And few children will have linked the "fun" (sorry, but for me this bedding ceremony is hugely humiliating and no fun at all, no matter under which circumstances it may happen, a sign that sex in marriage is for sure not about love in Westeros but institutionalized) of the adults with actual penetration, i.e. "consummation".So Sansa did not think about herself going through it, she saw it as outsider, as party guest, not really realizing that one day she would be part not only of a little fun but of that what follows: sex with a relative stranger she may not even particularly like.

1782	Blind Beth the Cat Lady	2013-05-24	Y'know, with all the people complaining about how the show's portrayal of Tyrion makes Sansa look bad, I think there's actually a big opportunity here to conduct some character development if the show handles it properly.  So, maybe viewers are critical of Sansa for not being nicer to Tyrion, because Tyrion is a pretty decent bloke on the show.  Well, how about if in the next few episodes, pre-Purple Wedding, Sansa starts changing her mind on Tyrion, by way of comparison with Joffrey in particular - moreso than she did in the books.  They could do a good job contrasting how the news of the Red Wedding affects her by showing how Joffrey treats her in the wake of that news versus how Tyrion does.  Maybe things are just starting to look up when the PW happens, and she ends up "escaping" with Littlefinger (she certainly has good reason to even if in the show she ends up liking Tyrion more than in the books, for fear of Cersei).  That would add a nice element of tragedy to what will otherwise be a rather exuberant response to the PW - Sansa gets to grow as a character and then just as she's getting to a place where we think she might be able to find at least a certain amount of contentedness in her situation, events conspire to take that away from her again.I hadn't thought about this possibility before, but I like it.  Hope it goes this way.
1783	Darth Zyroth	2013-05-24	You have no idea whether he noticed her tears or not, so blaming him for that is just speculative.OK.And Tyrion wasn't smiling because he didn't want the marriage either.  He was being forced to either marry Sansa, or a catatonic half-wit, so I'm not really blaming him for choosing Sansa, or for feeling miserable at the wedding.He was entitled to his misery just as much as she was, although he did stand up to protect her feelings when it really counted.I don't blame Tyrion for choosing Sansa or wanting to marry her. But he wasn't forced. He was convinced. I don't blame him either for feeling miserable during the wedding. He was in all his rights, just like Sansa because that wedding and marriage was miserable for both of them. And I<U+0080><U+0099>m not denying he protected her before the marriage, during the bedding, and even after when they were married. He did. I'm just saying that that attitude didn't seem exactly "nice" to Sansa. He wasn't being particulary nice to Sansa during the ceremony. So she didn't feel like being nice to him by kneeling, either.And then in terms of the choices she was given -- yeah, so what?  That's not Tyrion's fault, and his choice wasn't much of one either.It<U+0080><U+0099>s not Tyrion<U+0080><U+0099>s fault. I just mean that those choices didn<U+0080><U+0099>t seem very nice to Sansa, so it<U+0080><U+0099>s another reason why she wouldn<U+0080><U+0099>t feel like kneeling.Nobody is saying she didn't have the right to be unhappy, but it sounds as if you're saying he doesn't.Wait, what? I don<U+0080><U+0099>t think that way, and I never meant it to sound that way. You<U+0080><U+0099>re just assuming incorrectly. All I<U+0080><U+0099>m saying is that he didn<U+0080><U+0099>t seem or acted particularly nice to Sansa during the ceremony. Thus why she wouldn<U+0080><U+0099>t feel like kneeling. I<U+0080><U+0099>m just giving you the reasons why Sansa wouldn<U+0080><U+0099>t want to be nice to him and just kneel. I<U+0080><U+0099>m just explaining why Sansa was entitled not to kneel for him. Wasn<U+0080><U+0099>t that what our discussion was about in the first place?I say they're both entitled to be miserable.Exactly. Let me get this straight because I think you are not getting my point and I feel like at some moments you're even judging me . You said that you don<U+0080><U+0099>t understand why Sansa fans have to make Tyrion look bad. But I think sometimes you<U+0080><U+0099>re just assuming that. Many people in this thread (not directly referring to you) think that all Sansa fans hate Tyrion and think he's the worst person ever. But that's not true. In fact I<U+0080><U+0099>m a very big Tyrion fan, more than a Sansa fan. But I like Sansa a lot, too. I personally think Sansa had it worse than Tyrion. That's why I tend to defend Sansa more during this marriage. But both of them had it pretty bad and the marriage was a very miserable one for both of them, and I saw the misery of both characters during that wedding and marriage. I love the moments of strength they both had during that wedding.  I loved how Tyrion spoke up to Joffrey and defended Sansa during the beding, how he decided not to have sex with her, and how later during their marriage he tried to protect her, and saw it as his duty. I love how Sansa accepted marrying Tyrion, chose him over Lancel and thought that he wasn<U+0080><U+0099>t that bad, and I love that she did not kneel at the beginning. All I<U+0080><U+0099>ve been saying and arguing about in this thread is why I defend and admire Sansa<U+0080><U+0099>s decision of not kneeling, and why is a great moment of strength to her.  That<U+0080><U+0099>s it.

1784	Wouter	2013-05-24	Tyrion wasn't in a position to "let" Cersei or Joffrey say anything.   They said what they bloody well wanted regardless of Tyrion's wishes.If Tyrion hadn't agreed to the marriage, Joffrey nor Cersei would have ordered Sansa to marry him. They might have said she was to marry Lancel, instead, but not "the imp". Tyrion also lost a chance to tell Sansa himself. I'm sure that came over very well with Sansa, that it was Cersei who mockingly told her while her husband-to-be still hadn't. Tyrion said he couldn't come to her earlier for "reasons of state", but then those "reasons of state" happened to be that Sansa must not known so she couldn't attempt to do anything about it. In other words, Tyrion blatantly sided with Tywin and Kevan and Cersei against his wife. No wonder she didn't kneel to him, and barely talked to him later. She, too, had "reasons of state" not to trust a member of the enemy family, especially given her earlier experiences with trusting Cersei and given Tyrion proved to be on his family's side by being a loyal Lannister puppet in regards to her own wedding.I think Sansa and Tyrion could work. But not in those circumstances, Lannister and Starks are enemies and this wedding was in itself a hostile act meant to punish, humiliate and ridicule the Starks in general and Sansa in particular. Tywin must have been amused.At this point, you're not even arguing the text -- you're just arguing your feelings and making shit up.If anyone is "arguing feelings" here, it's you.
1785	Darth Zyroth	2013-05-24	She wants to be strong, sure, and her idea of strength comes from her older brother and father. That is a characteristic any younger child has, at least one that respects their parents. It has nothing to do with being a wolf, it's just about maturing and not pitying one's self.I'ts about trying to act like a Stark, and therefore a wolf. She even mentions this during her wedding:Ser Meryn Trant gave her a look that made her cringe, but Kettleblack touched her almost gently and said, "Do as you're told, sweetling, it won't be so bad. Wolves are supposed to be brave, aren't they?"Brave. Sansa took a deep breath. I am a Stark, yes, I can be brave.Lyanna Stark wouldn't need to remind herself "I must be like Brandon and be brave" because she's a fucking wolf.Well, we wouldn't know for sure since we never had a Lyanna POV.It is her wild instinct that defines her nature. Sansa does not possess this at all.It is not Sansa's nature. She believes more in "courtesy is a Lady's armor", and she tries to live her life by that stament. But she does posses that instinc, it's just not very promiment. We see it in a couple of occasions especially when she talks back and speaks up to Joffrey. For example when she tries to push Joffrey, when she says to Joffrey "Maybe he'll bring me your head". When she says "No!" in defence of Dontos. When she does not kneel. And there are more examples that right know escape me.
1786	Wouter	2013-05-24	Of course not. Winterfell was a burned ruin at this point, and there was no chance of her getting there anyway since the Lannisters won't allow it. She wants the more realistic option - the Willas marriage. How is that a sign of fairytale thinking? It could've easily happened.And why wouldn't she be happy when she expect to get out of the KL nightmare, Joff and the other Lannisters?Exactly. Considering Willas was crippled and she had never seen him, it was actually a sign of growing up that she could think so positively about it, partially because she could see the upsides you mention.
1787	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-24	But he wasn't forced. He was convinced.Marry Sansa or marry Lollys.  Yes, he was convinced given those options.I'm just saying that that attitude didn't seem exactly "nice" to Sansa. He wasn't being particulary nice to Sansa during the ceremony. So she didn't feel like being nice to him by kneeling, either.Okay, exactly what "attitude" are you describing here, because the author described no "attitude" at all.  If he wanted to make the point that Tyrion could see her crying but was deliberately ignoring it, he could have done so.  He didn't.  He describes a ceremony with words and singing, and never mentioned that Tyrion saw her face or tears.  Nor can I think of anything Tyrion could possibly have done during that ceremony even if he had noticed.  She was crying because she was getting married when she didn't want to.  Nothing Tyrion could have said during that ceremony would have changed that.  That's not failing to be "nice".  It's just standing there when there isn't anything else you can do about a shitty situation.It<U+0080><U+0099>s not Tyrion<U+0080><U+0099>s fault. I just mean that those choices didn<U+0080><U+0099>t seem very nice to Sansa, so it<U+0080><U+0099>s another reason why she wouldn<U+0080><U+0099>t feel like kneeling.I'm not sure what you're even arguing.  Are you saying that she was right not to kneel?  Again, rather than repeating arguments, I'll simply state that her being ashamed of not kneeling confirms to me that even Sansa knew that wasn't right.  Feel free to think differently, though.I<U+0080><U+0099>m just giving you the reasons why Sansa wouldn<U+0080><U+0099>t want to be nice to him and just kneel. I<U+0080><U+0099>m just explaining why Sansa was entitled not to kneel for him. Wasn<U+0080><U+0099>t that what our discussion was about in the first place?I thought that discussion was about 5 pages ago, but whatever.  Okay, I'll repeat my points.  I think Tyrion was as kind to her as circumstances permitted when they got married.  I think the text confirms that Sansa knew he was better than other Lannisters, and had been kind to her.  It's why, when presented with her limited option, she dedicded to stick with Tyrion rather than Lancel.I think there's no evidence that she disbelieved his claim that he didn't want the marriage either.  I understand why she was upset on that day, but I think the particular manifestation of her unhappiness, the refusal to kneel, ultimately pleased the people she really hated, and hurt the one she knew had been kind to her.   It backfired, which is why she was ashamed of it.  Nothing you say is going to convince me that it was right, that she believed it was right, or that it was a positive bit of character development for Sansa.  That's how I read the scene, and her being ashamed of her own action seals that interpretation for me.  Feel free to disagree.On the other hand, I don't condemn her for that.  She was upset, and it was understandable even if it wasn't right.  I think Tyrion understood that, which is why he bore no resentment towards her for embarassing him.   I do applaud her for being mature enough to recognize her mistake, feel badly about it, and kneel to finish the ceremony.And just to round it all off, given that it would be impossible to show her internal regret of that incident, the show took the appropriate route by removing her refusal to kneel entirely, rather than showing the refusal but not her being ashamed of it.

1788	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-24	If Tyrion hadn't agreed to the marriage, Joffrey nor Cersei would have ordered Sansa to marry him. They might have said she was to marry Lancel, instead, but not "the imp".So what?  Her only choice was marrying Tyrion or Lancel.  Instead of Tyrion making that choice for her by refusing the marriage, he let her make that choice by giving her the option prior to the wedding. I don't fault him for that.Tyrion also lost a chance to tell Sansa himself. I'm sure that came over very well with Sansa, that it was Cersei who mockingly told her while her husband-to-be still hadn't. Tyrion said he couldn't come to her earlier for "reasons of state", but then those "reasons of state" happened to be that Sansa must not known so she couldn't attempt to do anything about it. In other words, Tyrion blatantly sided with Tywin and Kevan and Cersei against his wife.No, he sided with them against the Tyrells.  And actually, Tyrion said he couldn't because his father forbade it for reasons of state, not because Tyrion himself made that call.   Had he told her, it would have leaked out.  Tywin likely still would have insisted on it the wedding to Tyrion or Lancel, but it would have made for a more awkward conversation with the Tyrells.  The result for Sansa would have been unchanged.  At least, that's how I think Tywin would have responded.  There was no way he was going to let Sansa marry a Tyrell.
1789	Mendoza	2013-05-24	The Lollys option worked out well for Bronn and even makes a fool out of the crown in the process.
1790	Wouter	2013-05-24	So what?  Her only choice was marrying Tyrion or Lancel.  Instead of Tyrion making that choice for her by refusing the marriage, he let her make that choice by giving her the option prior to the wedding.Sansa never really had that choice- arguably Tyrion made that choice when he accepted Tywin's proposal and he didn't take up the Lancel escape-route that Kevan and Tywin were cooking up (all a show for his benefit, as Tyrion himself thought, but he chose not to call their bluff on that one). Even if he could  still have come back on that (after he said to Tywin he accepted, which makes it somewhat doubtful as Tywin would not have been pleased), waiting until right before the wedding was too late.As I wrote earlier, the Lannisters had arranged everything and the wedding guests - those at the actual ceremony- were already waiting for the Tyrion-Sansa wedding. Sansa was in her wedding attire, Joffrey had given a clear order, Cersei had made her threats. Lancel, OTOH, was still recovering in his bed and not capable of going to the ceremony. No way that the Lannisters would make a switch just because Sansa would tell Tyrion she preferred Lancel. Cersei and Joffrey would simply go through with their threats (probably having Trant administer a good beating) while Tywin would make clear to Tyrion that he would have to do his "duty". No, he sided with them against the Tyrells.Which were to be Sansa's family-in-law, and that because she chose them freely. In fact, arguably Sansa negotiated her own political marriage with them, chosing to ally to the Tyrells in hope of getting protection and to be able to help her family later (as her in-laws would have reasons not to hurt her family too much). By siding with the rest of his family, Tyrion schemed against Sansa and against the Tyrells. She certainly didn't appreciate it. She got off much worse than the Tyrells did, too. They merely lost a juicy wedding prospect, while ,Sansa got what amounted to a life sentence.And actually, Tyrion said he couldn't because his father forbade it for reasons of state, not because Tyrion himself made that call.   Had he told her, it would have leaked out.  Tywin forbade Tyrion many things, but he didn't always listen, chiefly regarding Shae. Sure, crossing Tywin is dangerous, but when it was about his pleasure with Shae Tyrion risked it. Maybe his future wife would have been worth the risk, too?The marriage was apparently semi-public knowledge even before Sansa learned about it, as Shae knew about it. It would have been far from impossible, from an experienced "player" of Tyrion's calibre, to arrange a rumour to reach Sansa's ears without being the obvious person to blame. As it was, it seems there were plenty of leaks not started by Tyrion and it would only take a servant gossiping in the wrong (Tyrell?) ears to get a message through.And sure, there was no way the Willas/Sansa marriage was going to continue once Tywin learned about the plot. Still bugs me that Tyrion decided to take part in Tywin's counter-plot, quite willingly in the books (much less so in the show), making no attempt to warn Sansa. Show-Tyrion comes over much better here, because Tywin never gave him a choice and the whole thing was brought out in the open so Tyrion told her himself. That doesn't mean I think book-Tyrion is horrible, far from it. Only that Sansa's refusal to kneel - and to trust him even one inch after that - was very understandable considering what Tyrion's family did to her and to what extent Tyrion played along with them. Now that Tyrion has broken with his family, Sansa and Tyrion could probably come to a more or less cordial relationship.
1791	Silverin	2013-05-24	Marry Sansa or marry Lollys.  Yes, he was convinced given those options.1. That wasn't the only options. Tywin told him that if he doesn't want Lollys and now doesn't want Sansa he will find someone else.2. the fact that tyrion rather married a girl who very likely is compeletly against marrying him and hates his family in an attemt to humiliate her family and steal her inheritence since she is pretty, rather than a girl whose family mutually would benefit from the marriage speaks why tyrion is an accomplice and not a simple victim.3. If tyrin wouldn't have married Sansa, Sansa wouldn't have raped or anything. They would have marry Sansa to Lancel who was seriously injured and couldn't have consumated the marriage. Marrying her to tyrion didn't give her bigger protection than marrying to Lancel (I write this because I saw many saying that tyrion marryed her to protect her, LOL he was fully willing to consumate the marryiage till the very last moment, meaning rape her till the very very last moment.).4. By this time Joff friggin hates tyrion. tyrion with his "badass" Joffrey slaps basically painted a nice big target on to his back, if anything Sansa being his wife just made Sansa even more of a target of Joffs cruelty since he can strike two birds with one stone hurting her.5. At the PW even tyrion realises that he has to fear Joff because in the moment he becames adult he will go after tyrion. Those slaps are not that cool anymore.
1792	Ser Pounce FTW	2013-05-24	In further Sansa's povs she admits that she wouldn't mind to go through the bedding ceremony in another circumstances, being with people who love her and the man she loves.I don't know of any noble who married the "one they love" with the exception of Robb. Sansa was being na&iuml;ve here but most likely had never been exposed to this part of the reality of marriage. Her parents and Septa worked endlessly to keep her in the dark about life's difficulties and encouraged this sort of thinking.Tyrion said he couldn't come to her earlier for "reasons of state", but then those "reasons of state" happened to be that Sansa must not known so she couldn't attempt to do anything about it. In other words, Tyrion blatantly sided with Tywin and Kevan and Cersei against his wife. No wonder she didn't kneel to him, and barely talked to him later. She, too, had "reasons of state" not to trust a member of the enemy family, especially given her earlier experiences with trusting Cersei At this point of the story, Sansa has shown she is a safety risk when she has any important information. She has shared critical data twice now and both times it allows people to act. Ironically those actions are never in her favor. I cannot blame the Lannisters for not wanting her to know about the wedding any sooner given the clear clandestine planning on the part of the Tyrells. Tyrion could have risked it but he most likely would have been burned and he's not that type of self sacrificing character. His action is completely logical however, it sadly places Sansa in a position of disadvantage.and this wedding was in itself a hostile act meant to punish, humiliate and ridicule the Starks in general and Sansa in particular. Tywin must have been amused.Actually this marriage was about Tywin seizing more territory and had nothing to do with personal humiliation or ridicule or amusement. No where does the text give any reason to imply Tywin was amused about any of it and instead he continued to pressure Tyrion to consummate as quickly as possible and eventually get her pregnant to finalize the situation. He wasn't thinking about the Starks at all.
1793	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-24	1. That wasn't the only options. Tywin told him that if he doesn't want Lollys and now doesn't want Sansa he will find someone else.Tywin runs down an extensive list of noble familes who have turned down marriages to Tyrion, including a minor noble whose daughter had already been deflowered, says perhaps some minor lordling would agree, and then mentions Lollys.Marriages in Westeros among nobility are political, and everyone knows that.  GRRM says exactly that.  Being married to someone for political reasons, even if that someone is not fond of the bride/groom, is not out of bounds in Westeros.  For Tyrion to turn down a marriage that objectively was a good match for him genuinely surprised his father.  That's just not a normal thing in Westeros for noble men to turn down a great marriage just because they think the bride may not like them.As I wrote earlier, the Lannisters had arranged everything and the wedding guests - those at the actual ceremony- were already waiting for the Tyrion-Sansa wedding. Sansa was in her wedding attire, Joffrey had given a clear order, Cersei had made her threats. Lancel, OTOH, was still recovering in his bed and not capable of going to the ceremony. No way that the Lannisters would make a switch just because Sansa would tell Tyrion she preferred Lancel.Tyrion said that he'd put an end to "this farce", and if Tyrion said "No, I'm not going through with this", it would have stopped the wedding.  The bride can be dragged, but not the groom.  Now, maybe you don't think he'd have followed through on that, but that would be adding something that's not in the text.By siding with the rest of his family, Tyrion schemed against Sansa and against the Tyrells. She certainly didn't appreciate it.I disagree with both ends of that.  Tywin was not going to let Sansa marry a Tyrell, period, no matter what Tyrion did.  And I see absolutely no sign in the text that Sansa truly believed that Tyrion wanted that marriage either.  He denied wanting it, and her POV showed know skepticism or doubt of that statement.  She even noticed that he was frightened as well in the wedding chamber.  And again, this is just debating the same point about kneeling.  I think the argument-ender is her feeling ashamed for doing it, and you don't.  That's fine as far as I'm concerned.

1794	Blind Beth the Cat Lady	2013-05-24	In regards to Sansa kneeling in the show vs. not kneeling in the books, I don't think it's actually any change in her character or Tyrion's character portrayal.  It IS a dramatic change in situation.  In the book the wedding is sprung on her out of the blue, so she has more knee-jerk reactive feelings that she has no outlet for other than refusing to kneel.  Plus there's no time for Tyrion to come talk to her and break the news and sort of get on her good side because he can't talk to her about it because it's a secret.
In the show, on the other hand, she has days or weeks to mull over her bad fortune, Tyrion comes and talks to her about it--giving a better impression of himself--and she has a chance to vent and discuss the situation with Margery.  So by the time the wedding rolls around she's not any happier about the situation than she is in the books, she's just had time to resign herself to it.  Not kneeling for Tyrion makes sense for Sansa's character in the book situation, and kneeling makes sense for her character in the show situation.
Kind of wish people would calm down about this book --> show change.

1795	Q the Cat	2013-05-24	Did anyone notice how lovely the wedding decorations were?
The tablecloth embroidery was very nice and the food laid out looked delicious.

I never notice that kind of stuff.  Even at my own wedding.  HehBut I'll rewatch to try to pay attention this time.
1797	JonCon's Red Beard	2013-05-24	How the hell are puppies immature, fairy tale like?(...)Seriously it is like you critises Sansa that she dares to not want to be miserable for he rest of her life...When it was stated that pointing out that Sansa is a child that daydreams about an impossible life is criticising her? She's a child, it's normal for her, specially in her situation, to try to desperate cling onto her dreams and fantasies instead of the reality of her awful situation.And yes, anything that it hasn't happen in your real life it's fantasies and has few chances to happen, it's a fairy tale. Many girls dream that a prince would marry them: fairy tale. Many women have hope the man that ignore them would suddenly change their hearts, and love them and be happily ever after. Another fairy tale that won't happen for many people. Dreaming with a perfect scenario is not a bad thing, either.Sansa, despite everything wrong that happened to her, still believed that she would be saved by people who care about her, and provided her with a good man to be her husband, and she would be happy with it, with children, a lovely home, puppies, cats, hamsters and a lovely parakeet. She actually believed that the Tyrells had a chance to help her despite her situation as a hostage and Joffrey's favourite toy to torture. At the end, the Tyrells weren't her friends, they didn't care. And the Lannisters would marry her to a rapist if that benefit them in any way. There was no chance she would have the wedding of her dreams at all.I don't know of any noble who married the "one they love" with the exception of Robb. Sansa was being na&iuml;ve here but most likely had never been exposed to this part of the reality of marriage. Her parents and Septa worked endlessly to keep her in the dark about life's difficulties and encouraged this sort of thinking.Point taken. I'll rephrase it to "the man she could have accept to love". In normal circumstances, not war time, I'm sure Ned and Cat would have provided her with a noble husband that would fit more her ideas of knighthood and nobility.
1798	Silverin	2013-05-25	I don't know of any noble who married the "one they love" with the exception of Robb. Sansa was being na&iuml;ve here but most likely had never been exposed to this part of the reality of marriage. Her parents and Septa worked endlessly to keep her in the dark about life's difficulties and encouraged this sort of thinking.Sansa knows that. What do you think the Willas betrothal was? He obviously wasn't the one true love, so no, Sansa by this time is not really that naive.She didn't think Wyllas will be some one true love. But she was hoping they will end up liking each other and that she will be far away from KL.Honestly tyrion is far more delluded thinking that this marriage could ever work. When he wasn't the one bethrothed to Sansa he himself admitted no marriage between Starks and Lannisters can work because the situation grew so ugly. Yet when he is the groom he suddenly forgetts his very own statment.
1799	Woman of War	2013-05-25	Yes, and subconsciously Tyrion may have dreamt of finding the same innocent love he once had with Tysha - in his most delusional moments. But we know that he was a victim of child abuse, sexual and emotional. (disclaimer: yes, I know that the worse horror was on Tysha's side) A victim that had even more be victimized by having been made part of the guilt by his abuser, a very calculated move to make sure that the victim cannot perceive himself as victim, thus creating a weird dependency of his abuser by being "accomplice".
I agree that in RL there might be persons who are able without psychological help to overcome issues like that, the most resilient ones, those who are lucky to find back to a stable life afterwards, so many wars and progroms have taught that. But in RL nowadays children with traumata alike (hopefully) receive all kinds of qualified help and maybe then they will be functioning adults.
Those who are "compliant" on the surface may later crack with horrible PTSD or are permanently handicapped in their social interactions or emotional life. So is Tyrion. 
And his weird seeking to repeat the Tysha situation is an expression of being damaged. The child was not taken out of his disfunctional family in time, he did not get the therapy needed and the recognition for his abilities he deserved like anyone else, this is Westeros.
Read the Rereading Tyrion threads in the reread forum, they are controversial yet hugely interesting.

Well, they did have a chance to help her (Tywin himself said that he couldn't refuse them since they needed their support too much), so I am at a loss why you insist it was a fairy tale dream. And Willas being a good man who'd come to love Sansa was hardly that unlikely as you make it sound.

They had no compunctions to deliver her to the headsman for poisoning Joffrey. If they could make her believe she would be happy in Highgarden their plan would go more smoothly since Sansa would come willingly. Willas, puppies and picnics were the cheese in the Tyrell trap while the Lannister trap came without cheese. Big difference for the mouse in the end!If Willas is a good man or Bluebeard - there is no hint at all  in the text.
1802	Sansa in the North	2013-05-25	Well, we know Willas doesn't hold a grudge based on the fact that he was on great terms with the man who crippled him. We also know he loves reading so he is likely to be educated. And someone here said, he breeds dogs, yes? He sounds decent.
And yes, the Tyrells wanted Sansa's claim as much as the Lannisters. But they are more decent people overall. They wanted Sansa to marry Willas, so they ASKED her and she gave her consent. You can read them offering her Highgarden as "cheese in the trap", but the fact is that to Sansa it represented her escape from King's Landing, so there was something in it for her. Sansa knew the Tyrells were after her claim and that she was to marry a cripple she'd never met before, but she was determined to love him and make him love her, because he would have been her ticket out of King's Landing. She would have gained something. And to me, getting her out of King's Landing constitutes as helping her. Because there's no evidence that the Tyrells would have abused Sansa. She would have been treated with dignity as the future lady of Highgarden and she would not have had to endure beatings and live in fear of Joffrey. So yes, the Tyrells thought of themselves first in this scheme, but they weren't completly insincere. They also thought of Sansa, which is more than the Lannisters (and that includes Tyrion) ever did. But that's just my opinion, of course.
ETA: I think the Sansa/Willas match might be more like what the traditional arranged marriage in Westeros is like, as opposed to the Tyrion/Sansa marriage.

1804	Woman of War	2013-05-25	I think it is quite abusive to implicate a child with murder.
But the whole debate is pointless since Tywin, neither in the series nor in the books, would have left Sansa and her claim to any Tyrell.
Don't get me wrong, I loooooove the characters of Margaery and Olenna, especially the HBO versions, only what they did to Sansa was mean. She was collateral damage to them.

I guess she simply was not yet meant to be lost in oblivion by the author.

1807	Wouter	2013-05-25	At this point of the story, Sansa has shown she is a safety risk when she has any important information. She has shared critical data twice now and both times it allows people to act. Ironically those actions are never in her favor. I cannot blame the Lannisters for not wanting her to know about the wedding any sooner given the clear clandestine planning on the part of the Tyrells.I can and do blame the Lannisters for dragging a child bride, whose family there are at war with, to a forced wedding. And Sansa supposedly not being able to keep important information to herself (as Tyrion admittedly though, but then he never suspected she was about to escape nor knew anyone that she had a kind of secret alliance with the Hound) is neither here nor there in this case, as the Lannisters very much did not want Sansa herself knowing about it. Exactly because she would act (attempt to escape sooner, run to the Tyrells, kill herself,...). But that's what I was pointing out: if Tyrion did not want to take Sansa against her will (but was pressured by Tywin to do it), allowing herself to act to avoid it should suit Tyrion just fine, especially if the "leak" could not be traced back to him. As it happened, it does not seem like Tyrion wanted Sansa to find out beforehand, as Tyrion was unusually willing to respect Tywin's command and no go behind his back.Tyrion could have risked it but he most likely would have been burned and he's not that type of self sacrificing character.At that time he wasn't, no. Which is why Sansa had little reason to be kind to him. Later on though, Tyrion showed that he can be self sacrificing when he rode the pig (or was it the dog?) just to please Penny, even though he hated doing it.Actually this marriage was about Tywin seizing more territory and had nothing to do with personal humiliation or ridicule or amusement. No where does the text give any reason to imply Tywin was amused about any of it and instead he continued to pressure Tyrion to consummate as quickly as possible and eventually get her pregnant to finalize the situation. He wasn't thinking about the Starks at all.Of course he was thinking about the Starks, he wanted their territory in the north. The text stipulates that Tywin couldn't bear the thought of Tyrion the lecherous Imp "defiling" Casterly Rock with whores and wild orgies, but he obviously didn't mind handing Winterfell to him, and Ned starks' daughter to boot, after pointing out to Tyrion no family of any standing whatsover wanted to give the hand of their daughter to Tyrion.
1808	juanml82	2013-05-25	Well, we know Willas doesn't hold a grudge based on the fact that he was on great terms with the man who crippled him. We also know he loves reading so he is likely to be educated. And someone here said, he breeds dogs, yes? He sounds decent.And yes, the Tyrells wanted Sansa's claim as much as the Lannisters.

Things might have been different if Sansa had a reason to refuse them.And educated and dog breeder doesn't necessarily imply Willas is a decent sort. Even being in good terms with the Red Viper might not imply he'll be decent to Sansa, because he might treat fellow knights different than young girls. They do paint him like a decent guy and we probably won't get to know much about him anyway, but he might be cruel and abusive with those people below his station, and might feel women are below his station.
1809	Wouter	2013-05-25	Tyrion said that he'd put an end to "this farce", and if Tyrion said "No, I'm not going through with this", it would have stopped the wedding.  The bride can be dragged, but not the groom.  Now, maybe you don't think he'd have followed through on that, but that would be adding something that's not in the text.Isn't it you that has been saying Tyrion was ordered/forced by Tywin go through with this marriage? Why would he be able to resist Tywin suddenly after he had agreed to it and everything had been prepared (when calling it off would have meant a massive loss of face for the Lannisters) and not beforehand when he apparently didn't even dare to defy Tywin by talking to her? Why did he wait to give his offer until after Joffrey had commanded her to marry himself? Maybe it was a belated moment of courage for Tyrion, a spur of the moment thing. Still, I think this "choice" does not mean one can now say that Sansa accepted the marriage freely. Not only had she been intimidated into accepting it already, the choice given was like choosing between the pest and the cholera. I suspect Tyrion may have read way too much into her answer. I disagree with both ends of that.  Tywin was not going to let Sansa marry a Tyrell, period, no matter what Tyrion did.  And I see absolutely no sign in the text that Sansa truly believed that Tyrion wanted that marriage either.  He denied wanting it, and her POV showed know skepticism or doubt of that statement.  Sansa shows a lot of scepticism to Tyrion by lumping him in with the rest of his family as far as trust goes. She reminded herself that she had trusted Cersei, once, and what it had cost her. And she does let Tyrion feel that, by giving him "a wall of sullen courtesy as icy as the wall". Sansa didn't even confide her tears about her mother and her brother to Tyrion, even though he was the one to tell her and he liked to present himself as someone who did not want to hurt her. But Sansa gave him the cold shoulder, and given Tyrion's cooperation with his family, particularly in springing the wedding surprise on her, that was not wholly undeserved. After all, most of the Lannisters were jumping with joy over the Red Wedding and showing sorrow over the death of traitors is treason.If Tyrion had proven to be on her side by warning her beforehand, I think that would have been a very different relationship. The actions and treasons of the Lannisters always stood between them.
1810	Wouter	2013-05-25	The Tyrells never intended to help Sansa, they wanted her claim just as much as the Lannisters. They had no compunctions to deliver her to the headsman for poisoning Joffrey. If they could make her believe she would be happy in Highgarden their plan would go more smoothly since Sansa would come willingly. I disagree. I think the Tyrells had every intention to marry Willas to Sansa (which would have been good for both parties, and would have helped Sansa with her KL situation, given that the Tyrells were powerful enough the Lannisters could not just wring their arm). It's only after the Lannisters put an end to that plan that Sansa became expendable. There is also no reason to suspect Sansa would not have been happy in Highgarden, which is not KL and has no Lannisters in it.Even so, we don't know what agreement was made between LF and the Tyrells. Did they know LF would hire the dwarfs to provoke Tyrion? Did they know he would spirit Sansa away? To say that they delivered Sansa to the headsman is an oversimplification. We still don't know what they would have done if Sansa had not managed to get away, or if she had been caught afterwards.
1811	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-25	Isn't it you that has been saying Tyrion was ordered/forced by Tywin go through with this marriage?No, I said Tyrion was going to be forced to go forward with a marriage, but he did have the right to turn this marriage down.  I simply do not fault him for not doing so.Why would he be able to resist Tywin suddenly after he had agreed to it and everything had been prepared (when calling it off would have meant a massive loss of face for the Lannisters)He had the legal right to refuse, and said he'd put an end to it if Sansa wanted him to.  If Tyrion says "I am not going through with this", that's it.  So I don't understand your point about how he'd be able to resist.  He'd be able to resist by saying "No".   But Sansa said she'd go ahead with it, so Tyrion didn't call an end to the "farce".  If you want to say that you just don't believe Tyrion there, that he was lying, that's fine.  I don't think Sansa's POV reflects that doubt, and I rather think that was Tyrion's honest conscience coming through.  But it's unproveable either way, of course.and not beforehand when he apparently didn't even dare to defy Tywin by talking to her? Why did he wait to give his offer until after Joffrey had commanded her to marry himself?Because that was the first time he talked to her since Tywin's command.Sansa shows a lot of scepticism to Tyrion by lumping him in with the rest of his family as far as trust goes.

After all, most of the Lannisters were jumping with joy over the Red Wedding and showing sorrow over the death of traitors is treason.In the wedding Chapter, Sansa specifically distinguishes Tyrion from others in his family.  But again, I don't understand your point here.  Exactly what are you arguing?  Is this just another try at the "not kneeling" debate?If Tyrion had proven to be on her side by warning her beforehand, I think that would have been a very different relationship. The actions and treasons of the Lannisters always stood between them.Tyrion was on Tyrion's side, just as Sansa was on her own side as well.  I do not fault either of them for that, and in particular, I don't fault Tyrion for not falling on his sword to protect Sansa's wedding prospects.  My reading of Sansa's character is that she wouldn't have given two shits about anything that happened to Tyrion, and objectively, Tyrion had no obligation to give two shits about her fate either.  That's not the way Westerosi marriages work.  If a male noble gets an arranged marriage with a young, attractive bride from a powerful family, they generally don't first check with her feelings to see how she views it.  They view themselves as fortunate for having negotiated a good match for themselves with the parents.What makes Tyrion different is that, on a number of occasions, Tyrion does stand up for the interests of this person to whom he owes no obligation, at risk to himself, simply because he has empathy, a sense of justice, and some consideration for her feelings.  I do not fault him for not putting her fate above his own, though.  Maybe a perfect paragon of virtue would have considered only her fate, and not his own, but that's not Tyrion.  I see him as still a good guy at this point in the story, but not a perfect, selfless one.Hope that clears things up.

We still don't know what they would have done if Sansa had not managed to get away, or if she had been caught afterwards.They would obviously have known that Tyrion would be provoked.  Otherwise, who did they think the fall-guy was going to be?
1813	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-25	I'm fine with them not showing that scene as long as they show him acting at his lowest, like you suggested, maybe throwing up over a whore instead. He has to be shown at his most pathetic state, and they can achieve this without putting that scene in out of no where. I agree there needs to be a descent.Just caught something.  After Tyrion threatens Joffrey during the reception, and then starts talking drunk so as to not let the whole thing get out of control, Tyrion mentions that he once threw up on a girl "in the middle of the act."  That reference is not in the text.  I realize that's not something that happens in Essos after the PW, but you have to wonder where they got that idea from.  That suggests to me they may not include that scene when Tyrion gets to Essos.That reception scene, on rewatching, is just fantastic.  Tyrion's outburst at the mention of the bedding, and Joffrey's shocked snarl when he realizes what was just said, are perfect.  And in the background, you can see Sansa's face, and it's perfect as well.  She's knows exactly what just happened, and she actually looks very nervous for Tyrion as everyone is waiting to see how Joffrey reacts.  She crosses her arms protectively over her midriff at the mention of being stropped, and then when they're finally walking out, she's still holding her midriff as if scared of getting stripped, and watches Joffrey sideways.On rewatching, I also get the sense that Tywin actually sympathizes with Tyrion here.  I wouldn't go so far as to say he respects what Tyrion did, but there doesn't seem to be any anger at Tyrion for creating that crisis.  The way he handled that almost made me like the (metaphorical) bastard.  Another reminder that Charles Dance is Tywin Lannister.Just a fantastic scene from the book, translated to screen superbly.http://www.youtube.c...h?v=099RncoNNSM

1814	Wouter	2013-05-25	They would obviously have known that Tyrion would be provoked.  Otherwise, who did they think the fall-guy was going to be?Oberyn. The waiter(s). The cook. Stannis and Melisandre. Joffrey merely choking by accident. Or Tyrion anyway, given the level of animosity that pre-existed. Still, we don't know the extent of their arrangement with LF. By betraying the plot to marry Sansa to Willas, LF did doublecross the Tyrells. They weren't that close as allies (logically, it's LF after all, the most untrustworthy man in Westeros and Essos combined). He had the legal right to refuse, and said he'd put an end to it if Sansa wanted him to.  If Tyrion says "I am not going through with this", that's it.  So I don't understand your point about how he'd be able to resist.  He'd be able to resist by saying "No".Technically, Sansa could have said "no" too. I just don't see that working out well in practice, certainly not for Sansa but probably not for Tyrion at that point (right before the wedding!) also. Tywin would have been furious as he would have been made a mockery by his dwarf son.Because that was the first time he talked to her since Tywin's command.Tywin's command was given because Sansa must not be warned until the marriage trap can be sprung on her. By definition, it would be too late for her to choose then. I don't understand Tyrion went along with all the preparations and then, when things were too far along for a change in scenario, he suddenly gave her a choice that wasn't really a choice. What did he expect Sansa's answer meant, did he feel this meant she married him willingly?In the wedding Chapter, Sansa specifically distinguishes Tyrion from others in his family.  But again, I don't understand your point here.  Exactly what are you arguing?  Is this just another try at the "not kneeling" debate?Sansa has always realised Tyrion is relatively kind to her. She also knows he is still one of her jailors (both points were illustrated well enough when Tyrion halted that particularly savage beating and then had her locked in the tower of the Hand). The point is, since Tyrion acted as part of his family, including in the matter of the wedding (also as Hand though), he couldn't very well expect that Sansa would come to her with her sorrows and her joys, as he wanted.My reading of Sansa's character is that she wouldn't have given two shits about anything that happened to Tyrion, and objectively, Tyrion had no obligation to give two shits about her fate either. That's not the way Westerosi marriages work.  If a male noble gets an arranged marriage with a young, attractive bride from a powerful family, they generally don't first check with her feelings to see how she views it.  They view themselves as fortunate for having negotiated a good match for themselves with the parents.My reading of Sansa is that she is often caring about people most wouldn't give two shits about, like drunk Dontos (about to be executed) or wounded Lancel (whom she didn't have reason to like even a bit). In the Vale, Sansa seems uneasy at the prospect of Tyrion getting shortened by a head. The Tyrion-Sansa marriage was not negotiated obviously, it was little more than legalised rape and organised theft (of lands and castles) by force of arms.
1815	Wouter	2013-05-25	Just a fantastic scene from the book, translated to screen superbly.On that one, I agree. The adaptation has its faults, but the adaptation of the entire wedding and bedding scene was done masterfully IMO. I don't mind the changes, they made sense in the situation layed out by the show.
1816	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-25	Technically, Sansa could have said "no" too.I don't think that's true.  We're told a man can't be forced to marry, but nobody says anything about a girl, and Cersei tells her -- convincingly, IMHO, that she'll be married no matter how much she objects and screams.  Frankly, i suppose Westeros likely has seen a few such screaming scenes by strong-willed brides who objected to the match.  They're dragged and married anyway.  Call it what you like, but that's the norm/expectation in the society in which they live.  I don't think that's true for women who have reached their majority, like Lady Hornwood or Cersei, but it is true for maids like Sansa.ETA: You may be right in this particular instance, but only because Tyrion gave her an opportunity to say "no", which would then lead to him saying "no" as a proxy of sorts.  But there isn't any indication that her "no" alone would stop anything.  Quite the opposite, in fact.The point is, since Tyrion acted as part of his family, including in the matter of the wedding (also as Hand though), he couldn't very well expect that Sansa would come to her with her sorrows and her joys, as he wanted.Well, yes.  I don't think anyone here is disputing that Sansa has no obligation to love Tyrion, and him expecting that is naive.  Especially given the reality that such marriages aren't about love, but about politics.  A reality that adult Westerosi understand.

1817	Shebara	2013-05-26	I actually think he is. In the show, he was still hurt when Sansa said "what if ... never?". Much like in the books, only in the books Shae doesn't care. But her character is very different on the show, where she seems to generally love Tyrion and want to marry him.Shae noticed the sheets were clean. Would that mean Tywin won't hear immediately, or is there a chance Shae is putting on a really good act and actually spying for Tywin?If the story is to go along with the book there will be need that Shae will go against Tyrion in the future...in the books Shae is just a whore who milks Tyrion as he has to notice in the future...in the series it seems she will betray him out of jealousy and wounded love.
1818	silentwanderer	2013-05-26	In the books, Shae only cared about money.
On the show, Shae only cares about Tyrion.
It makes her all the more richer and complex as a character to me.
1819	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-26	In the books, Shae only cared about money.On the show, Shae only cares about Tyrion.Personally, I dont think show Shae cares about him either, except as a meal ticket.
1820	The Killer Snark	2013-05-26	I personally thought the bedroom scene was very tastefully handled, but since they've physically raised the ages of most of the younger actors and actresses, I thought it was absurd for Sansa to say she was 14, because the actress playing her clearly isn't. She is 16-18 at a day. This is like TV Catelyn claiming to be in her early 30s. Folks, it is just silly. They should have raised the character's age and it still would not have made any difference to Tyrion's moral decision not to sleep with her.

1821	Woman of War	2013-05-27	I think at least one year got lost in oblivion by Sansa telling she was fourteen. She started at Winterfell at the age of thirteen. Only a few months between the party at Wnterfell and the wedding?? Tyrion travelling to the Wall and being taken to the Eyrie in the speed of light? All that war, Blackwater, Robb's an Catelyn's trip to Riverrun, Dany's baby must have taken nine months at the first season before the dragons even hatched - and now they are quite big.
The timing is wrong!
No, I think they made a huge mistake, they aged up all kids, they should not have forgotten Sansa. She looks as if they could have taken an eighteen year old actress from the beginning for her role. Why did they bother with a minor if Sophie Turner looked like eighteen from the first season on? They could easily have found an eighteen year old who looks like fourteen and plays a thirteen year old.

That's the only difference).Approximately 1 year and six month have passed since the beginning one can guess. Robert in Winterfell (May 298), T/S wedding (November 299).

Ok, but still Sophie Turner looks too old for the role. Fourteen - never! If they had taken an eighteen year old looking younger they might have less trouble with minors on set and more professional acting.

1825	The Killer Snark	2013-05-27	Since they decided to make a lot of the characters physically older than they are in the novels, it is a question of the logic of the series for the ages of the TV characters to correspond.
1826	Joyful Union	2013-05-27	I like how Sansa was calm and dignified, despite the horror of the event and the way it crushed her dreams, while Tyrion was a complete disgrace. His vomiting story in particular, extremely thoughtless given the circumstances. I think they did get that dynamic right.
1827	The Killer Snark	2013-05-27	Tyrion behaved in the most gentlemanly manner possible. He got drunk because he hated the forced marriage, which in fact made a direct mockery of any efforts he'd made at an honourable bargain with Catelyn. In the novel, he gets humiliated at the wedding more than he does in the episode; Sansa shows no gratitude for how he's helped her in the past against Joffrey but he still protects her against humiliation by Joffrey and then decides not to sleep with her as a point of honour. You can cut the guy some slack for being depressed enough that he got drunk.
1828	Woman of War	2013-05-27	You are right, Killer Snark. But what I did not like that in the books Tyrion partly only played drunk while in the series he did not suddenly sober up when Sansa and him were alone. Well, he acted reasonably while being so drunk, so maybe the difference is of no importance.
1829	StannisEndGame	2013-05-27	Stop blackwashing BookTyrion! He wasn't that bad, do people here get turned on discussing how evil he is? Besides, making a character more sympathetic does not automatically make him/her less complex. He is still playing for the "wrong" team and quite actively so.

No, I thought it a good thing that book Tyrion was more in control.  If HBO Tyrion had at least a little sobered up after that notorious vomiting phrase the situation in the bedroom might have been even more intense.
And in the books Tyrion embarrassed Sansa on purpose in order to deflect Joffrey's agressions while in the series he overdid his poor manners because he was so drunk.

1831	Rapsie	2013-05-27	And in the books Tyrion embarrassed Sansa on purpose in order to deflect Joffrey's agressions while in the series he overdid his poor manners because he was so drunk.Well that's a matter of interpretation. In the books it seemed like he embrassessed her because he was in a foul mood and had already rebuked her when she asked him to dance. He had no reason with the portcullis remark to deflect anything as Tywin had already overruled Joff. He was just doing his usual say something witty regardless if it hurts or terrifies someone.
1832	Rapsie	2013-05-27	Besides, making a character more sympathetic does not automatically make him/her less complex.

I enjoyed every embarrassing moment.I thought that the "smash your porticullus" in the books and the vomiting story in the show were for the purpose of Tyrion thoroughly establishing that he is drunk so the comments he made to Joff don't come back at him later. But, he did certainly seem more than tipsy so maybe it was just an accidental slip of the tongue.
1835	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-27	I took his behavior in both show and books as taking the out Tywin gave him about being drunk.  He was drunk, yes, but prior to that, he was quietly drunk.  He was running at the mouth in case Joffrey had second thoughts.  And all the portcullis stuff was a way of saying the bedding wasn't necessary because he was about to do his duty anyway.

Personally, I see the fact that he sides with his family as the heart of his greyness as a character up until the end of ASOS. To me, things like breaking poor Marillion's fingers or reluctantly threatening to have Tommen buggered pale in comparison to the fact that he expends all his efforts in defending Joffrey's claim to the throne, a claim he knows to be non existent and even if successful, ruinous to the realm since he knows what Joffrey is.

Deliver KL to the enemy to be sacked? He could never have made that decision openly. Poison his nephew in time? Tommen would have been king, his birthright is not better or worse than Joffrey's. Secretly leave and live as mummer or slave in Essos? Without Daddy's name behind the dwarf would just be a plaything for slavers. And why should any commoner's fate improve because the king has the "correct" birthright? Starting a war over "mummy's baby, daddy's maybe" is the most immoral and egoistic thing to do. Joffrey turned out as nightmare and you can argue that Tyrion should have had him killed (it's childkilling no matter if the boy is evil or not) but Tommen's claim is not better. Should Tyrion have invited Stannis to behead his whole family?

1838	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-28	Starting a war over "mummy's baby, daddy's maybe" is the most immoral and egoistic thing to do.That's an intereseting argument, though i don't agree.The whole concept of the right to rulership is a tough one in a non-democratic system, but the rules of inheritance and legitimacy are the core of the social contract they have.  It's what is supposed to prevent succession, at all levels, from becoming a free for all.Ned was clearly willing to start a war over the false paternity though he had nothing to gain from it personally.   And he certainly didn't do it for selfish reasons.  The false Kingship of Joffrey was a violation of the social contract.ETA:just to be clear, I think the wisdom and morality of Ned's position is debatable, but it's not "the most immoral and egoistic" thing to do.

Insisting on his birthright at all costs, the immoral action, this is what Stannis does. But it is hard to see who started the evil thing of delivering cause for war, was it maybe Baelish with the dagger lie or....
Whoever - no one of all those Lords cared the least little bit about the inhabitants of the kingdom and their welfare.
It's like the times of Cold War in our world: it's pointless who started it, what counts is who might be able to end it.

Now you can argue that he was not after war but after the murderer of Jon Aryn. But he did not consider the implications of what he did.I think he did.  He knew exactly what Robert would do if he found out about the incest, but was resolved to reveal it anyway.  To Ned, it was simply wrong.Insisting on his birthright at all costs, the immoral action, this is what Stannis does.But it was Ned who sent the bird to Stannis telling him that he was the rightful King, and if Ned could push Stannis' claim for reasons of principle, why couldn't Stannis?  Heck I always read Stannis as essentially seeing this situation the same as Ned -- a matter of principle.  Not as a selfish desire for power.ETA:  I suppose it also should be pointed out that Stannis (rightly) believed that the Lannisters had murdered the rightful King, his brother.  If the conduct of the Lannisters is going to be tolerated simply because it's too messy to clean it up, then you've basically tossed both the law and the social contract out of the window.But it is hard to see who started the evil thing of delivering cause for war, was it maybe Baelish with the dagger lie or...Well, if I'm putting blame anywhere, it's first on Jaime and Cersei, who knew the possible results of their incest, and what it would mean for the kingdom if discovered, but placed passion over the fate of the realm.  I think that is a truly despicable and utterly selfish act.   And Renly is just about as bad.  He's got no valid claim at all, and declares himself King just because he thinks he can get away with it.  Had Renly stayed loyal to Stannis, there's no way the Tyrells would have sided with the Lannisters, and the war likely would have been ended with the family that caused the whole situation, the Lannisters, defeated.But to bring this all around to the topic, I don't really fault Tyrion for siding with his family despite the above, though I don't give him credit for any particular nobility in that respect either.  He attempted to be as decent as he could under the circumstances, sort of playing the Rommel role.Personally, I see the fact that he sides with his family as the heart of his greyness as a character up until the end of ASOS. To me, things like breaking poor Marillion's fingers or reluctantly threatening to have Tommen buggered pale in comparison to the fact that he expends all his efforts in defending Joffrey's claim to the throne, a claim he knows to be non existent and even if successful, ruinous to the realm since he knows what Joffrey is.Though I don't blame him for siding with his family, I do agree that his being aligned with the "bad guys" is what makes him grey in most readers' minds from AGOT forward.  I wanted the Lannisters to lose the War of the Five Kings, and that included losing the battles in which Tyrion participated.  But of course, I also hoped he'd survive.  And I completely agree with your comments about Marillion's fingers, the threat to Tommen (which I don't believe he'd have carried out and that didn't affect Tommen one bit), etc. really are par for the course in Westeros, and don't mark him as a bad guy.

1841	Batman	2013-05-28	First of all, I understand the Tyrion "whitewashing" because book-Tyrion is waaay too grey of a character for a TV audience to like/connect with him. They needed a (for the most part) "good guy" leading role after Ned died. His flaws are still there, but they are presented as a lot more forgivable.Why does it work in the novels? I think you are right but I just dont know why. Are TV audiences stupider than book readers? Are they worried about media backlash.Look at Batman, how much they sanitized him for film. In the books it was clear he was all about vengance, whereas Nolan tried to sell Batman's message as hope. He wanted to "inspire" people in the films. Superman is about hope and Batman is about vengance.And Robin, look what they did to Robin. In the Schumacher movies the actor was like 25, hardly a "boy wonder". Then Nolan mangled the character beyond recognition. They cant have Batman train a 12 year old boy to face Joker, Two-Face, mobsters and rapists on film because it shows how crazy Batman is. And Batman is just as crazy as the Joker, but for some reason its a harder sell in the films than the books.Sorry for the rant. Everything relates back to Batman/Superman.
1842	Colonel Green	2013-05-28	And Batman is just as crazy as the JokerThat's only one interpretation of Batman.
1843	Batman	2013-05-28	That's only one interpretation of Batman.A few interpretations. Alan Moore, Grant Morrison and Frank Miller being the most prominent. Most interpretations of Batman are crazy, some less than the Joker but still crazy. Nolan cleaned him up for film.

Yeah, I think there's a pretty good chance that Tyrion was just thinking how completely fucked up the entire situation was.  He makes a comment later when his father his pressing him to get Sansa pregnant to the effect of "when do you think she'll be at her most fertile -- before or after I tell her that her brother and mother have been murdered?"
1846	Zorpack	2013-05-28	I thought that, too, but 3x08 seems to have resolved that, judging by the smile between Shae and Tyrion. I think they'll be pretty functional as a couple again until the PW, at which point Shae will likely betray Tyrion to save herself.I'm more curious about how the escape plot will be reintroduced. Unlike in the books, where there was only one escape plan since ACOK and Sansa could just revert to the default when her marriage to Loras fell through and she was married off to Tyrion instead, there are two escape plans in the show: Littlefinger's first plan to take Sansa away with him when he departed for the Vale (which fell through), and the second plan, which we don't know anything about yet.Since there is a second escape plan, it will have to be introduced at some point (I'm thinking 3x10, since it looks like Sansa and the rest of the KL crew sit out 3x09), by someone. (The "someone" is a bit tricky, since Littlefinger's still in the Vale, Dontos has been MIA since Season 2, Ros is dead, and Shae is an unlikely ally for Littlefinger since she trusts him about as far as she can throw him, but it will have to be someone.) So I'm guessing Sansa will be approached by someone in 3x10 with the new plan to get her out of KL.In the books, doesn't Littlefinger leave out to somewhere and then upon his return and help of Dontos retrieve Sansa for escape? I'm currently re-reading so Ill know soon but I believe I remembering thinking "Whoa, that's so good I would've never thought of Littlefinger" being as though he wasn't in KL.

And a sixteen year old young adult bears far more guilt than a thirteen year old child, so this would be kind of "blackwashing".Though the scenario that Tyrion talks about his participation after Jaime's revelation, for the tv audience to hear - these two confessions in one plotline would have an enormous impact.

As others said I find it selfish as well when other characters just because they have the "blood" feel they have the right to pay the price, which is the blood of others who never agreed to pay it to begin. that said lets not pretend tyrion did it for the good of the realm. He did it for the Lannister family.Btw people saying Willas is an abusive jerk. For one thing we know he is not vindictive and petty, after all he is best friends with the guy who crippled him.tyrion broke a guys finger just because he mocked him, he threatend the slave girl at Illyrios house just because she didn't want to sleep with him...You know if the only way you can paint someone as decent is by making everyone else the biggest douche ever it is a fail in writing. Just like if the only way you can make someone seem smart is make every one of their enemies stupid is again fail. Neither does make the guy decent or smart. Reminds me of this clip, just like the guy beating the kids doesn't mean he is strong at all:http://www.youtube.c...h?v=4yG0QE9ce3UThis Willas is a jerk thing reminds me of those lame soap operas where if a new love rival appears then you can be sure she/he will turn into a jerk, and everyone sais it the moment they appear even if they seem nice and kind. And of course they end up right... Gotta make sure main girl/guy is the super bestest out of all...Though I think Willas is not a jerk.For one thing in the world of GRRM jerks have a very distinctive characteristic, that they are handsome and quite lively. Everytime someone who is handsome and not a moopy male appears you can tell he will turn out to be a bigger jerk than the less dashing gloomy "nice guys".Thus since Willas is crippled in the contex of the story he can very much be a decent guy.

1854	Newstar	2013-05-28	Btw people saying Willas is an abusive jerk.Wait, what? I can't find a single instance in the books where anyone has anything negative to say about him. I mean, Willas could be a jerk, for all we know, since we've never "met" him in the books--and may never meet him--but there's no evidence to suggest that he is.I'm not sure that Sansa's marriage to Willas would have been as ideal as some imagine it would have been, since I'm pretty certain Highgarden is going to get sacked by the Ironborn in the not-too-distant future--Highgarden's too pretty and idyllic for it not to get razed to the ground, since GRRM seems to love destroying pretty things in ASOIAF (which sort of makes me wonder what else he has planned for Sansa, but leaving that aside for the moment)--and I'm therefore extremely grateful Sansa's nowhere near that place. There's nothing, however, to suggest Willas himself is a bad guy.

1859	Lord Freypie	2013-05-29	Are people really defending the idea Tyrion should have married Lollys ?
The proposal was just made to insult him (or show him he had no serious other option), matching the son of one of the seven families to a low nobility second daughter (would not even have been heir to Stokeworth, without Bronn and Cersei) also considered feeble, and pregnant from lowborns (look how patriarcal societies consider such victims even today) also being far over usual Westerosi wedding age and ugly. In addition to losing his political influence based on keeping good relations to his father (and Tyrion wanted to remain part of the game, he had developped a taste for politics being Hand), he would have completely ridiculed himself, definitively losing any hope to see his claim supported, accepting such misunion. Saying he didn't married her just because she was ugly is stating like 2% of the reasons he had for refusing her.

Saying he didn't married her just because she was ugly is stating like 2% of the reasons he had for refusing her.Yes, but you could also ask "are people really defending the idea that Sansa should be happy to be married to Tyrion". He is, after all a second son and not heir to Casterly Rock, considered feeble because of his dwarfism and has probably impregnated a score of low borns. He may have even caught a few nasty diseases in the process. He is also over traditional Westerosi wedding age and ugly. And Sansa will lose her "political influence" by marrying him, because her only worth at court is that she is heir to Winterfell and once she's married it will be gone to the Lannisters. She also kind of lost good relations with her family, because Robb disinherited her because of the marriage, and lost any hope of seeing her claim supported. She was completly ridiculed during the wedding. Yet there are a lot of people (not talking about this thread, but the internet in general) who think the only reason Sansa didn't want Tyrion is that he is ugly.Look, I'm not saying that Tyrion should WANT to marry Lollys. I'm on record saying that we all want an attractive mate and there's nothing wrong with that. But I do have a problem with Tyrion's mean-spirited remarks at her expense. I previously pointed out that at least Sansa doesn't do anything like that and that she tried hard to find the beauty in Tyrion. So no, I don't think Tyrion should want to marry Lollys. But I don't think "Eeew, thye would have married me to Lollys (and her lack of inheritance)!" is a good enough excuse for participating in the forced marriage of a minor.
1861	Sansa in the North	2013-05-29	It is not in the book. It is the people who sais that marrying Tyrion is better to Sansa because they theories Willas could be a jerk etc...

Primarily, as I guessing the majority of readers will actually read it as being more of a punishment for Sansa in connection to her crimes of being "shallow" and what not.But this, too! I'm not sure who I agree with here... /dunno.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':dunno:' />
1862	Woman of War	2013-05-29	Actually i think Sansa would have a better  life if she weren't standing out to be seen as beautiful. This is of course about a  fictional character, there is no real Sansa that could be hurt. Just as I did not want Jaime to lose his hand, Tyrion his nose, Myrcella and Brienne half their face I would not want Sansa to be mutilated. But Martin will hardly ask us, he will do what the plot demands.
1863	Silverin	2013-05-29	I rather an innocent child not be mutilated just so Tyrion can receive some ironic punishment for refusing an ugly wife.  Primarily, as I guessing the majority of readers will actually read it as being more of a punishment for Sansa in connection to her crimes of being "shallow" and what not.I wouldn'T want to see Sansa mutilited.And I don't agree with you that people would see ike that.The thing is if her beauty fades yet she is comfortable and happy in her skin they cannot see that as a punishment, since it doesn't make her miserable.The sam reason while people say the Willas bethrothal was fairytale like. Because it didn't make her miserable.If she would be unhappy all over the fact that she has to marry a thirty something (how old is WIllas?) cripple, who might be ugly and she wants to marry Lorras etc no one would say it was a fairy tale arrangment.But since she tried to see the best in the situation, since she didn't end up miserable people say it is fairytale like. Since she didn't focused on the fact that she will marry an old cripple possibly not goodlookking guy, who she doesn'T even know but she focused on the possibly positive things that might give her joy, like for example she will out of KL, and that is not a fairytale, if the marriage would have happened she would have been out of KL, or that she would be able to play with puppies which again is not fairytale, Willas breeds dogs and that means there are lot of puppies there.Seriously neither is a naive dream. If the marriage would have happened unless Willas is a ridiculuosly sadist bastard she could have both. Of course she doesn't think about the sex life in the marriage but she is a kid for gods sakes.These physical flaws, weigh, scar etc do not neccesserily mean you will be miserable. As long as you don't let it get to you, you feel comfortable in your own skin etc.

1864	Lord Freypie	2013-05-29	Yes, but you could also ask "are people really defending the idea that Sansa should be happy to be married to Tyrion".Never said that.Now I don't think Tyrion or anyone need excuses for being part of a marriage serving his interests and supported by his family autority in a society like Westeros. He would have had merit to refuse, it's a different thing.I wouldn't have found credible for him to refuse, not even according to his personnality but to what I know of human nature tendancy to indulge themselves in doing bad things when supported / asked for by an autority. Not consummating the marriage he showed he is probably not in the 62% of humans who would have delivered the maximum voltage in Milgram's experience (more likely he is in the 30% or so stopping when they have to establish physical contact with the victim out of autority presence), which is already good enough in my mind for a realistic character. If he was in the 5% able to completely refuse to take part in autority supported torture, he would have abandonned his family far before that marriage. Making him refuse at the proposal stage wouldn't have looked realistic for me.
1865	silentwanderer	2013-05-29	The first season did such a good job to establish that a woman who was almost raped would never do what Tysha did,  Shae made it as obvious to audience as it was for her that Tyrion's first marriage was a fraud.Hm, i don't know, Jaime and Tyrion were there in time to prevent the worst, so the grim reality of her situation may ot have been so obvious to thirteen year old Tysha.If the almost raped part was even half as bad as Brienne's was, Tysha would've never even invited a man to her tub 2 days later (much less to her bed two hours later).Then again, book Tysha was a real peasant that really fell in love with Tyrion.Show Tysha, on the other hand, was a real whore who really faked the whole thing and Shae & Bronn were just street wise enough to catch it.

I never said that you said Sansa should be happy, just that people do say that. Lots of people. And lots of people ignore Tyrion's faults.
1867	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-29	Primarily, as I guessing the majority of readers will actually read it as being more of a punishment for Sansa in connection to her crimes of being "shallow" and what not.I don't think anyone has said that being shallow is a crime.  It's just being shallow.The thing is if her beauty fades yet she is comfortable and happy in her skin they cannot see that as a punishment, since it doesn't make her miserable.The same reason while people say the Willas bethrothal was fairytale like. Because it didn't make her miserable.It's not a question of misery.  At least, not to me.  It's a question of her immature expectations. The nobility in Westeros are enormously privileged compared to the mass of people who struggle to find food, live in fear of bandits, predatory nobility, etc..  Sansa does not appear to have any real recognition of that, or appreciation for how privileged she truly is.  She has expectations of enjoying all the privileges of nobility, but does not seem to have much of a clue about the obligations, or the sufferings of other people.   This stands in contrast to the other Starks, who all have a good idea of what the underbelly of Westeros really looks like.  Catelyn knows this -- even as a noblewoman, there are some hard, dirty aspects to life, and some unpleasant realities.  She had to marry dour Ned, and move to the frozen North and leave Riverrun behind.  But she got that it was part of the tradeoff for not living the brutal existence of the smallfolk.  It's part of the obligation of being in the nobility.  Sandor sees the same thing -- a girl who simply isn't aware of the reality around her, and still sort of thinks the world revolves around her dreams.Someone made the point above that what has happened to Sansa is "chump change", and that is true in many respects.  Is she the only girl in Westeros to have lost a father?  Compare her situation to the children of Flea Bottom, or all the orphans of the war, or what happened to Mycah and the thousands of other Mycahs who are victims of the war.  We read all the other POV's, and see the conditions in which those characters live, or what is happening to the smallfolk generally, Bran and Rickon running for their lives, and then read Sansa giggling over her new dress and dreaming of puppies and flowers.So it is not a question of wanting Sansa to be miserable.  It is wanting her to get a clue that being noble born isn't just a lifelong ticket to living much, much better than everyone else.  It is wanting her to mature, start valuing things beyond just those that fit her dreams, and understanding the obligations that go with her privileged birth station. This is not to say that she should be happy about marrying Tyrion. But her basis for objecting to the marriage should be of more substance than just wanting the dream of Highgarden.

That is not naivety, neither is childishnes.It is exactly wanting her to be miserable because you basically want her not to feel happy or joy for those small things. My gretgrandma had a life so hard most of the people even if westeros couldn't compare yet she can feel increadibly happy if we bring her choclate. She is past 100 year old and she can feel happy about a single choclate.
1872	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-29	By that time Sansa outgrown her clothes her breast were hardly held in them, she was happy that she finally got a new dress that fits her.Really?  That's all it was? That's not how I read it:Cersei herself arrived with the seamstress, and watched as they dressed Sansa in her new clothes.  The smallclothes were all silk, but the gown itself was ivory samnite and cloth-of-silver, and lived with silvery satin.  The points of the long dagged sleeves almost touched the ground when she lowered her arms.  And it was a woman's gown, not a little girl's, there was no doubt of that.  The bodice was slashed in front almost to her belly, the deep vee covered over with a pattern of ornate Myrish lace in dove-grey.  The skirts were long and full, the waist so tight that Sansa had to hold her breath as they laced her into it.  They brought her new shoes as well, slippers of soft drey doeskin that hugged her feet like lovers.  "You are very beautiful, my lady", the seamstress said when she was dressed."I am, aren't I?" Sansa giggled, and spun, her skirts swirling around her.  "Oh, I am."So it's just that poor little Sansa had to dress in ill-fitting rags before that, eh?  That's not how I read her POV on this, but I suppose we just differ on that.It is exactly wanting her to be miserable because you basically want her not to feel happy or joy for those small things.At the present time, there are slightly bigger things going on in the world and within her own family that should lead her not to be giggly about this.  Her father has been murdered, her sister is missing, her brother is at war, she doesn't know where her mother is, and she's being married without their consent and without any of them being there.  And she's positively giddy.My gretgrandma had a life so hard most of the people even if westeros couldn't compare yet she can feel increadibly happy if we bring her choclate. She is past 100 year old and she can feel happy about a single choclate.Somehow, your description of her does not bring to mind Sansa's situation.

But I am sure that at some point of the books she will learn.And it is not true that anyone wants her to be miserable for the sake of miserable.  But I want her to broaden her horizon just like so many other characters, to see that life despite all odds is full of possibilities if you actively and cleverly  grab them. You need the willingness to take risks, confidence in yourself and optimism for it.

Even his "fans" want to see him grow and move on from where he is, and a necessary part of that is recognizing that he has flaws and imperfections. But that's the perplexing part for me with respect to Sansa.  You can't be rooting for and expecting a character to grow and mature unless you acknowledge that the character is currently at a point where they need to grow and mature.  And that means recognizing and admitting where that character's current shortcomings lie.  Yet, the Sansaverse generally takes great exception to any criticism of Sansa, as if she is already wise, mature, and fully-developed.  If it is truly the case that she is beyond criticism, then she cannot possibly grow, because she's already perfect.

If a fourteen year old were already perfectly complete,  had no issues to work on, no imperfections and flaws, if she already were what she might become one day  - that would be a truly sad thing! Being old before even having grown up.

Even his "fans" want to see him grow and move on from where he is, and a necessary part of that is recognizing that he has flaws and imperfections.I would hardly argue that is complete and accurate picture, instead I have found many more Tyrion fans who will equally whitewash his flaws with them repeatedly arguing that his dark actions are justified or not that wrong and that he is actually a swell guy.  Quite frankly, the only reason many people turned against him in ADWD seem to come more from how he wasn't particularly witty anymore then his actions.  Yet, even then you have people justify his rapes of sex slaves and so forth.Thus, simply I would argue more people do what you complain about Sansa-fans doing for Tyrion then is ever done for Sansa.  Especially, in there are numerous fans that wish to deny any growth or positives about Sansa and instead make her one of the most hated characters in the series.
1877	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-29	I would hardly argue that is complete and accurate picture, instead I have found many more Tyrion fans who will equally whitewash his flaws with them repeatedly arguing that his dark actions are justified or not that wrong and that he is actually a swell guy.There may be disagreements about his flaws, and whether or not some of his actions are wrong or not justifiable, but I don't think I've ever run into anyone who says he has no flaws.   But in any case, rather than talking about the opinions of unnnamed other people, I rattled off a bunch of his flaws in my post.  Can you give us a list of Sansa's flaws, as you see them?Quite frankly, the only reason many people turned against him in ADWD seem to come more from how he wasn't particularly witty anymore then his actions.  Yet, even then you have people justify his rapes of sex slaves and so forth.None of which has anything to do with whether or not Sansa has any flaws, and your post didn't even touch on any of them.  All you addressed was Tyrion, which is a nice illustration of the reluctance to discuss Sansa's flaws.Thus, simply I would argue more people do what you complain about Sansa-fans doing for Tyrion then is ever done for Sansa.Is it possible for you to discuss whatever flaws Sansa may have without reference to Tyrion?Especially, in there are numerous fans that wish to deny any growth or positives about Sansa and instead make her one of the most hated characters in the series.I think there needs to be some clarification here.  People can discuss whether or not a particular character is "good", or "noble", or "evil" or whatever moral judgement they'd like to make about that character. I think the number of people who find Sansa to be a morally repugnant character is likely quite low.Then there is the second sense of whether you find a character to be interesting, amusing, entertaining, annoying, boring, etc..  That's not really moral judgment at all.  For example, I personally like Catelyn in both senses, and though I despise what Cersei does morally, I still find her to be an interesting character.  Same with Jaime and Tywin.  On the other hand, while I think Danys is a morally admirable character, I can't stand her as a character from pretty much the Unsullied/Dracarys scene forward.  Not really a fan of Jon's character either even though he's a "good guy".I think some folks hate Sansa as a character, in this latter sense, because they find her annoying, not very interesting, etc..  It's not saying that she's evil -- just saying that they don't find her to be interesting or fun.  So they'll say "I hate Sansa", and some folks seem to get genuinely offended by that, and that's a reaction I don't think I've seen with respect to any other character.

1878	Silverin	2013-05-29	At the present time, there are slightly bigger things going on in the world and within her own family that should lead her not to be giggly about this.  Her father has been murdered, her sister is missing, her brother is at war, she doesn't know where her mother is, and she's being married without their consent and without any of them being there.  And she's positively giddy.Oh I guess I should inform every single person with a hard life, that hey didn't you know you shouldn't feel happy and enjoy anything because you should spend all your time worrying about the horrible situations you experienced, you experience, you will experience.I guess i should inform them, that according to you that is maturity.Well I diisagree, people like that are the people who are broken. Life broke them and they can no longer enjoy the simple things, they just constantly worry and live a miserable life. But you know what? That is the easy thing. When horrible things happen concentrating only on them and not being able to enjoy life is a weakness.Why do you think some people reach the point where they have no more strength and give up they life. Seeing things so dark that they feel there is no escape?People who lost the ability to enjoy the small things like a new dress, puppies, a good meal etc are sad. If anything Sansa still being able to enjoy these are actually showing how they didn't break her yet, though it cannot be said anymore after AFfC, I don't really remember her being happy or exited after ASoS.I know nowdays the brooding joyless melancholic heros are oh so popular that doesn't make them strong, neither does all the darkness make them more mature, or smart.Btw there is a really famouse story about books of an author (I don't think his books are translated into other languages, but he is one of the most popular author in my country). They are light funny adventure novels, nothing deep or anything just fun. Yet more people told that when they were in the gulags these nonesense lightnovels kept the spirit in them. Not some higher purpous, not some distant memory, some heavy philosophing, but the ability that even in the worst of the worst situation they didn't lost their abilty to enjoy those meaningless things.

1879	Minsc	2013-05-29	Is it possible for you to discuss whatever flaws Sansa may have without reference to Tyrion?Can you do the opposite seeing how your response to someone pointing out how your statement regarding Tyrion and his fans is wrong seems to have been "Sansa has flaws, Sansa has flaws" despite that not being what was addressed.  Instead, my whole argument relates to how quite a number of Tyrion fans act like he is the purest definition of "good, brave, and strong."Thus, disputing your claim about how Tyrion fans accept he has flaws while supposedly all Sansa fans are the only ones to pretend their favorite character is perfect.  Therefore, there was no reason for me to address Sansa's flaws in how I was attacking your absolute bullshit statement of how all Tyrion fans are objective of his flaws.So I can equally ask you can you actually address Tyrion truthfully without trying to turn the discussion into one attacking Sansa and her fans?However, in an attempt to humor you as how you will probably just ignore my actual argument and crow off again on "What about Sansa? What about Sansa?" I will list some of her flaws.Simply, at the beginning of the series yes she does show herself to be naive on the reality of the world, she in the beginning is somewhat spoiled (through that is true of all of the Winterfell kids), she is generally passive, and she does seem to have stubborn belief of holding onto an innocent view of the world thus she is sometimes blind to the treachery that surrounds her.

I even know some who forget the slave he raped in ADwD, that is how much they acknowledge his flaws...Simply, at the beginning of the series yes she does show herself to be naive on the reality of the world, she in the beginning is somewhat spoiled (through that is true of all of the Winterfell kids), she is generally passive, and she does seem to have stubborn belief of holding onto an innocent view of the world thus she is sometimes blind to the treachery that surrounds her.I think Sansa at the beginning is also mean and selfish she mainly thinks about herslef but you can say that about a lot of person.I think she is kinda slow, but she isn't hopelessly stupid as some think, but neither do I think she is some mastermind, or will ever be a mastermind.She is snobby, especially at the beginning. But that seems to change in AFfC.

Why do you think some people reach the point where they have no more strength and give up they life. Seeing things so dark that they feel there is no escape?You apparently only see two options -- either surrender and crawl mentally into a hole, or escape via fantasy/whatever to get whatever small joys you can.  I personally see a third -- fight back, either physically, emotionally, verbally, or whatever.  Hold your anger at your situation, and plan to improve it.  Take the Arya route, or the Tyrion route, or the Sam route, though god knows it took him awhile to end his nauseating pity-party.  That Sam, the original one, I couldn't stand.  Yeah, daddy was mean to you.  Tough shit.  Grow a pair.  And lo and behold, he did. Now, this is exactly why the example of an very old woman is such a crappy example.  There really isn't a future for such a person, so getting the small pleasures that you can out of life makes sense.  But when you're young?  Fight the fuck back, externally if you can, internally if you must.I know nowdays the brooding joyless melancholic heros are oh so popular that doesn't make them strong, neither does all the darkness make them more mature, or smart.I'm not talking about sliding into depression because you're giving up.  If you've got targets, as in people who've screwed you and continue to screw you, then get through by a determination to get them back someday.Anyway, can you identify any of Sansa's flaws as of, say, prior to her leaving KL?

And lo and behold, he did.tyrion is a miserable shit in AdwD, I am glad she didn't take that route.Sansa doesn't hold grudges though so what you write there is not her. The fact that she helped Lancel when he was wounded, that she felt bad when Joff died shows that. She isn't one to recite a list in her head.Enjoying life is not an escape, not a fantasy, that is LIVING it. Being obsessed with all the shit that happens doesn't make you though.And enjoying life doesn't stop you from trying to improve it, or to get through. If anything the pity party is what usually stops people in real life from acomplishing their goals.Now, this is exactly why the example of an very old woman is such a crappy example.  There really isn't a future for such a person, so getting the small pleasures that you can out of life makes sense.  But when you're young?  Fight the fuck back, externally if you can, internally if you must.Why would be that a crappy example? Do you think for years she couldn't enjoy anything then out of the blue she can again? She is a tough woman, but she never lost the ability to enjoy life. And enjoying life is a way to fight back, it sais that you can throw all the shit at someone you still won't be able to break them. If you let other people bitter you then in a way you let them win. Not letting them destroy your personality your enjoyment of things is a way to fight back.I'm not talking about sliding into depression because you're giving up.  If you've got targets, as in people who've screwed you and continue to screw you, then get through by a determination to get them back someday.Lol that just means they defeated her. Since she gives up her own life and own goals in order to concentrate on revenge. It is not some admirable thing. Revenge doesn't worth a thing. Living life being obsessed with revenge is being miserable.Anyway, can you identify any of Sansa's flaws as of, say, prior to her leaving KL?Read my post above.weren't you one of the tyrions fans who admitted didn't even remeber that tyrion raped someone in ADwD?

1883	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-29	....in how I was attacking your absolute bullshit statement of how all Tyrion fans are objective of his flaws.Please quote and bold my post where I said that all Tyrion fans are objective regarding his flaws.  In fact, didn't I specifically say that there was disagreement, even among fans of his character, regarding the morality of many of his actions?Simply, at the beginning of the series yes she does show herself to be naive on the reality of the world, she in the beginning is somewhat spoiled (through that is true of all of the Winterfell kids), she is generally passive, and she does seem to have stubborn belief of holding onto an innocent view of the world thus she is sometimes blind to the treachery that surrounds her.Okay, great.  So if someone said "I can't stand Sansa because she's naive, spoiled, passive, and stubbornly holds on to an innocent view of the world and is blind to the treachery around her", you'd agree that opinion would have a basis in fact?  Because I have to tell you, I've had plenty of people rather hotly dispute criticisms of Sansa on those exact grounds.
1884	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-29	tyrion is a miserable shit in AdwD, I am glad she didn't take that route.Sansa doesn't hold grudges though so what you write there is not her.Okay, full stop right there.  I'd agree with you.  Sansa doesn't seem to hold much with grudges.  But a great many people think that this is a situation in which grudges should be held. That you shouldn't forget those who have wronged you or your family, and that you should want to fight back and get revenge.   So stating that it "is not her" helps explain why those people won't like her character.  And for such people, Sansa's failure to do so is irritating as hell.  I'm not sure why that is objectively not a valid reason to dislike a character.Of course, since this is a work of epic fiction that we read to be entertained, I rather think the character that does want revenge is a lot more interesting than the one who salves those memories by thinking of how pretty she looks in a new dress.  Opinions may vary on that, of course, because those are subjective evaluations.Lol that just means they defeated her. Since she gives up her own life and own goals in order to concentrate on revenge. It is not some admirable thing. Revenge doesn't worth a thing. Living life being obsessed with revenge is being miserable.And not really caring if the people who murdered your father get away with is...odd.  Personally, I'm a bigger fan of this guy:http://www.youtube.c...h?v=i3W5GDkgf2wGiggling over a dress and puppies doesn't have quite the same impact, does it?  More importantly, I don't think it makes nearly as enterntaining or interesting a character.weren't you one of the tyrions fans who admitted didn't even remeber that tyrion raped someone in ADwD?It wasn't the thread that reminded me, but a reread, but yes.  But then, I also stated that remembered ver yclearly how horrible he was to Penny, and that it was all part of his descent into a very dark place.  So it's not exactly like I had whitewashed him mentally.ETA:I think she is kinda slow, but she isn't hopelessly stupid as some think, but neither do I think she is some mastermind, or will ever be a mastermind.  She is snobby, especially at the beginning. But that seems to change in AFfC.So as of ASOS, in addition to the descriptors above regarding her being "naive", etc.., I can add "kinda slow" and "snobby" to the list.Yup, Sansa Stark, kinda slow, snobby, naive, spoiled, and passive, at least through ASOS.Honestly, have there really been that many other crticisms of Sansa that go beyond those?

Thus, basically repeating the same statement before of where Tyrion fans are so great with their objective insight into his flaws through with few disagreements.

1887	Cas Stark	2013-05-29	Can't the same be said for fans of any character--that they downplay the flaws and exaggerate the good points?  Whether its Sansa or Tyrion or Dany or whomever.
1888	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-29	I all ready quoted your exact statement where you were praising Tyrion fans on the back for how they acknowledge that see he has flaws, while criticizing Sansa fans for refusing to see that she has flaws.What?!  Now you're changing what you said.  Here's the reminder of your statement:....in how I was attacking your absolute bullshit statement of how all Tyrion fans are objective of his flaws.I have never stated that "all" Tyrion fans are "objective" of his flaws.  That's simply a flat-out lie, and the post you quoted says nothing about "all" Tyrion fans, nor does it say anything about them "all" (or otherwise) viewing him "objectively".  You've deliberately exaggerated what I did say do it would be easier to condemn.  Again, please link the statement where I said what you quoted above.There is a lot of disagreement among those who like Tyrion as a character as to exactly how "grey" he is.  Some support actions that others condemn.  That disagreement exists, and I expressly acknowledged it in the post that you did quote.  I personally have not read any opinions on here -- though I suppose they may exist somewhere -- of people saying he had no flaws whatsoever. Never read any of his fans getting upset because someone said he was a whoremonger.  At the least, his drinking and whoring are acknowledged to be vices by the vast majority of fans.  And I don't know of anyone who defends morally all his actions in Essos.  If such a person exists, well, good luck to them, because that's an indefensible position in my opinion.But hey, I'm happy I finally now have a listing of acceptable criticisms of Sansa, so I don't bring down the wrath of her fans if I happen to mention one of those flaws.

1889	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-29	I for example would seriously hold it against the character Tyrion if he were the jolly good fellow after having murdered his father and his lover, if he still saw the bright side of life everywhere. He would be thoroughly unbelievable then, cold, heartless, an outright sociopath.Me too.  I still think the killing of Tywin and Shae were justified, though him personally killing Shae in that manner is indicative of someone not right in the head, either due to malevolence, extreme passion, or whatever.  What makes his arc so interesting to me is how I think those actions pushed him further down into doing other things in Essos that he would never have done in Westeros.  It's almost like he's snapped, and given up the fight to keep a moral compass that likely he's likely been fighting every day since Tysha.
1890	Sansa in the North	2013-05-29	I guess fans of every character downplay their favourite's flaws. But how can you say that Tyrion fans acknowledge his flaws when you yourself said:Or they don't consider those things to be faults at all. I don't consider Tyrion's agreement to marry Sansa as being even the tiniest bit blameworthy, and actually praiseworthy when he offered her the Lancel option.Objectively, participating in the forced marriage of a 13 year old IS blameworthy.Another slightly related thing about favourite characters: I didn't care that much about Sansa when I first read the books, but then I saw the insane sexist vitriol directed at her on the internet. I've now spent so much time defending her and it's helped me to understand her better, so she is now one of my favourite characters. So, I think that fans are so defensive of their favourites partly because they are "fighting back" when these favourites get unjustified hate.
1891	Silverin	2013-05-29	Okay, full stop right there.  I'd agree with you.  Sansa doesn't seem to hold much with grudges.  But a great many people think that this is a situation in which grudges should be held. That you shouldn't forget those who have wronged you or your family, and that you should want to fight back and get revenge.   So stating that it "is not her" helps explain why those people won't like her character.  And for such people, Sansa's failure to do so is irritating as hell.  I'm not sure why that is objectively not a valid reason to dislike a character.Well then you have different priority.Sansa wants some revenge, like she wants the Freys to suffer, but she won't destroy her own life for it. It doesn'T worth that much. If you do that you basically let the one who wronged you win twice. One for doing wathever he/she did, and two for sacrificing the truly important things in your life.Of course, since this is a work of epic fiction that we read to be entertained, I rather think the character that does want revenge is a lot more interesting than the one who salves those memories by thinking of how pretty she looks in a new dress.  Opinions may vary on that, of course, because those are subjective evaluations.Aren'T in fiction characters always want to get revenge? And again being able to enjoy life isn't escaping from the hardships. So she isn't slaving her memories by letting herself enjoy damn dress.On the other hand tyrion being constantly drunk in ADwD is slaving his memories.And not really caring if the people who murdered your father get away with is...odd.  Personally, I'm a bigger fan of this guy:Again she does care but she doesn't want to sacrifice her own life to get the revenge done. And she still can feel compassion. I didn't watch the video as I said I think revenge is worthless.Giggling over a dress and puppies doesn't have quite the same impact, does it?  More importantly, I don't think it makes nearly as enterntaining or interesting a character.I disagree, fictions are full of people who want revenge, they are everywhere. Characters who are not that hang up on it are far less. I am tired of selfabsorbed revenge-seeking selfappointed judges.I actually find Sansa's character really refreshing compared to other typical fantasy characters, with all of her immaturity and childshness. Btw yes I think Sansa is childish since she is a child, but it isn't the being able to enjoy a dress or wanting a dog that shows that.It wasn't the thread that reminded me, but a reread, but yes.  But then, I also stated that remembered ver yclearly how horrible he was to Penny, and that it was all part of his descent into a very dark place.  So it's not exactly like I had whitewashed him mentally.At least you admit it.So as of ASOS, in addition to the descriptors above regarding her being "naive", etc.., I can add "kinda slow" and "snobby" to the list.Yup, Sansa Stark, kinda slow, snobby, naive, spoiled, and passive, at least through ASOS.Honestly, have there really been that many other crticisms of Sansa that go beyond those?Oh there are many.Like she should be trigger happy marrying Tyrion, some even go as far as she should give him pity sex.She killed Ned. She killed Lady.Btw you critisis her because she can (at least in ASoS) still be happy for a friggin dress, jeez girl was beaten constantly and after a year of horror one good thing happens and she dares to be happy about it, what a child...That is among the most ridiculuos critisms.I for example would seriously hold it against the character Tyrion if he were the jolly good fellow after having murdered his father and his lover, if he still saw the bright side of life everywhere. He would be thoroughly unbelievable then, cold, heartless, an outright sociopath.She didn't killed anyone either. The poster said she should have fight back like tyrion.I am happy that she didn't choose that route as a fight back method.

His family destroyed her family, publicly humiliated and abused her, murdered her father, she is given no choice in the matter, I'm not even sure if suicide would have been an option for Book Sansa since the wedding was taking place 'right now'.  Tyrion deserves blame for participating in further emotional torture and manipulation of Sansa Stark by marrying her against her will and legally tying her to the Lannisters forever.

1894	TNine	2013-05-29	While Tyrion fans are certainly (very, very) guilty of whitewashing his behavior, i see a lot of...blackwashing of his behavior, especially by Sansa fans who seem to want to demonize him as much as possible.  And perhaps that is the point of Tyrion's character--to be the grayest of the gray, with divisive opinion.
Look at how he acts in regards with Tysha and Sansa with the rape incidents.  Saying "he freely raped Tysha", or that he shouldn't get credit because "he didn't rape Sansa" is a vast oversimplification of the situation.  In both situation, he is faced with serious incentive to carry through with the action (including not having to face social stigma), and serious threats if he does not carry through.  I mean, look at Tysha's situation.  A thirteen-year-old, faced with his father staring him down, and a battalion of guards around, with the orders of "do it or pay the consequences" from a man who once eviscerated two entire houses?  And coupled with that was the fact that he believed Tysha was nothing more than a whore in for the money?  Could you have said no?  I doubt i would have that kind of strength.  And again, with Sansa, he faced serious ridicule and pressure from his family and society itself, while receiving almost nothing from Sansa.  And yet he stops himself from following through with the action, since he believes in doing the right thing.
Does that make him a great character, on par with Ned Stark?  No.  Is it ludicrous to use those actions as evidence to frame Tyrion in as dark a way as possible?  Yes.  He deserves credit for what he does right and criticism for what he does wrong, but he's pretty firmly in the middle ground.
Keep in mind that i like Sansa far more than i like Tyrion.  But you can't cherrypick incidents and use that as proof for what a character really is like.
1895	Aleenys	2013-05-29	I'm not a Sansa fan, and I have found some of the defenses of her alleged intellectual growth, her agency or lack of same to be extremely tortured, but how can you say that Tyrion should not be blamed for marrying Sansa come on?His family destroyed her family, publicly humiliated and abused her, murdered her father, she is given no choice in the matter, I'm not even sure if suicide would have been an option for Book Sansa since the wedding was taking place 'right now'.  Tyrion deserves blame for participating in further emotional torture and manipulation of Sansa Stark by marrying her against her will and legally tying her to the Lannisters forever.Exactly. There is no subjectivity in this. Not even a chance.And I call BS on people who put forward the idea that he married to protect her, or even help protect her from his family. There is no support for this in the text. He wanted Winterfell, and he wanted Sansa too. I'm sure if she had done a better job of hiding her disgust from him he would have gladly consummated the marriage, but he didn't want to have a wife who hated him, and hoped that being kind to her led to her wanting him eventually. Tyrion would have gotten "good guy" cookies from me only if he had sat her next to him in their wedding night and told her that he would never harm her and she shouldn't worry about the consummation at all. He was too much of a coward to do that, and perversed enough to desire her. Instead, chapters and chapters we listen to his whining about his bitterness at Sansa even refusing to look at him. Too bad your forced child bride doesn't want anything to do with you, dude.
1896	Woman of War	2013-05-29	Aleenys, you are doing exactly this what Cas Stark was critising: Cherrypicking of events to support your argument
1897	Blind Beth the Cat Lady	2013-05-29	The more people fight about who was terrible to whom in the marriage and which character is more flawed/sympathetic/terrible/awesome, the more I ship for Sansa and Tyrion to end up as a shockingly happy power couple, each content that the other has a beloved paramour on the side, ruling some unburned corner of Westeros with wit and poise.
When in reality Tyrion will probably get eaten by a dragon and Sansa will go totally Stockholm Syndome with Littlefinger.
1898	Aleenys	2013-05-29	While Tyrion fans are certainly (very, very) guilty of whitewashing his behavior, i see a lot of...blackwashing of his behavior, especially by Sansa fans who seem to want to demonize him as much as possible.  And perhaps that is the point of Tyrion's character--to be the grayest of the gray, with divisive opinion.Depends on the way you look at it, I guess.I myself am very critical of his behaviour in this marriage because I felt betrayed by Tyrion's character. Like many people, I had thought Tyrion was a morally good guy and glossed over his misdeeds up until that point. I remember reading Sansa's first ACOK chapter and was quite happy with his attitude towards Sansa, I thought he would probably be one of the few people who truly sympathized with her situation without wanting any benefit out of it. I never thought he would look at Sansa that way, though I know now that I should have known better. So his attitude during this whole marriage stuck out to me like a sore thumb. Weirdly enough, it wasn't Tywin or Shae's murder that made me lose respect for Tyrion first, many people cite this event or the rapes for their wake-up call about Tyrion. For me it was this marriage. I guess what I'm saying is, Tyrion wasn't someone I thought he was, so this whole marriage situation made me extremely pissed off at him because I didn't expect him to act this way. Some people might have thought he was a gray character by then, and actually give credit to him for not meaning Sansa any harm or raping her. That's not the side I'm looking at him from, so I'm very critical against him. Hooray for opinions.
1899	Woman of War	2013-05-30	Tyrion wasn't someone I thought he was, so this whole marriage situation made me extremely pissed off at him because I didn't expect him to act this wayYour post sounds a little like disappointed love. And it is never indifference that creates the strongest negative emotions but disappointment, in RL as well.But isn't this what makes good writing: the characters do the unexpected, they may act irrationally, make mistakes, do not consider all circumstances, act spontaneously under uncertainty - and yes, sometimes they surprise us readers with moves we would never have expected from them and do not like. Should we then withdraw our favour like a sulking kid, taking this as personal betrayal of our fan loyalty? No, I think it is the quality of Martin's writing is the characters are not cardboard cuts of good and evil but that they are complete human beings. If a character is interesting he or she stays  interesting, we should stay with them through thick and thin. Will you start hating Sansa if she has a part in Sweetrobin's or anyone else's murder? Will you lose interst or will you see this as necessary part of her story arc in order to become the character the author has in mind?The author has plans with his characters, they have to do what they do and Martin cannot care about the different tastes of fandom since they will always differ. The story of the characters and the book in general is paramount. Good books are no fan service, they are literature and the poor wronged girl is nothing but a tool in the story to promote important events. Martin will have his reasons to link Sansa and Tyrion in one storyline. I for example think that making Sansa and Tyrion marry was a great literary trick in order to create foggy frontlines, not only for the characters inside but as well for the readers as analysing observers behind the moral microscope. Ironcast morally cleansed rules for whom we are supposed to root as readers are for lazy thinkers and can never make good literature.The biggest sin a literary character can commit is being boring.

1900	Rapsie	2013-05-30	I myself am very critical of his behaviour in this marriage because I felt betrayed by Tyrion's character. Like many people, I had thought Tyrion was a morally good guy and glossed over his misdeeds up until that point. Agree completely. I was certain he would tell her as soon as they got o the bedroom that he was there to protect her and instead we got the awful "knight of flowers" and attempted rape. But isn't this what makes good writing: the characters do the unexpected, they may act irrationally, make mistakes, do not consider all circumstances, act spontaneously under uncertainty - and yes, sometimes they surprise us readers with moves we would never have expected from them and do not like. Should we then withdraw our favour like a sulking kid, taking this as personal betrayal of our fan loyalty? No one is denying Tyrion is a well written or engaging character, it is those that continually whitewash him because they can't stand liking a villainous / antihero or grey character that are the problem. You can still like a character but admit they are on a dark path. It's when you have a character like Tyrion, that some people like so much, that they over emphasis their favour and like someone supporting a freedom fighter who has become a tyrant, fail to acknowledge any possibility that their favourite is no longer the amazing hero they thoughts they were and instead make excuses for every action they make to explain how it's not their fault.Being part of the forced marriage made him start to dislike Tyrion, but I still enjoyed his chapters, even his ADWD ones. It was only on a re-read and the Tyrion re-read where it became clear that he had been a bitter, mead spirited, self-pitying person from the start of the series, but that had been hidden as his nicer traits, had been emphasised and on the first read through you take everything he says as gospel and do not realise he is an unreliable narrator. He is still a funny character though.It's fine to like Tyrion. I like Victarion, but I'm not going to justify him killing his wife to whitewash him or to suggest that Stannis burning people alive is okay. It puts Stannis on to a severely anti-hero category and for some people that makes him a villain (along with Renly's death). The biggest sin a literary character can commit is being boring.Well the Damphair wins that award IMHO, but TV's Whitewashed Tyrion is certainly winning it for the series as he has become even less flawed than Ned! On unsullied forums he is being referred to as a true hero, with all the attributes of one. To be honest given the characterisation so far,I think they are going to struggle to make him believably kill Shae, unless they go out of their way to make everyone else look so bad that he is justified in his actions. Although given they have changed the plot and mangled characters to do that this season (as they have had to do with everyone surrounding Robb because of the Talisa change) they may well continue, and next season we will find out Shae will be torturing kittens for fun with her new bf Joff.The more people fight about who was terrible to whom in the marriage and which character is more flawed/sympathetic/terrible/awesome, the more I ship for Sansa and Tyrion to end up as a shockingly happy power couple, each content that the other has a beloved paramour on the side, ruling some unburned corner of Westeros with wit and poise.Sadly I think you are right. Sansa deserves a happy ending, but sadly she will not get it, instead she will no doubt be made into the loving trophy wife of Tyrion, of the titanium plot armour.

1901	Lord Freypie	2013-05-30	Do you realise the show is written by people knowing the ending of the story and having first hand access to Martin's analysis of his own characters ?
Either Tyrion whitewashing is there to make his fall into darkness even more shocking, either it's done to fix something as Martin tried to make him a character readers understand and continue to root for despite a darker passage and failed to anticipate some readers extreme reactions (to the point some even rate him as "beyond redemption" in a recent thread, in lists not even including other PoVs).
Tyrion is not a secundary character but one of the main protagonists, likely to have a future in the story. They certainly aren't whitewashing him for no reason.

1904	Woman of War	2013-05-30	Of course they are doing for a reason - higher ratings and more DVD sales. That's their main goal, not accuracy to the books or Martin's future plans for the characters. They think they need a heroic and conventionally likeable main character for viewers to root for.I think the showmakers want to and will be true to the intended endgame by Martin, they will not fundamentally change the fate of main characters but they may choose different paths to get there - due to the medium.And their changes ar not always "whitewashing". I for example was annoyed by making Jaime kill his relative because I think this is not in line with his Lannister character. But the wonderful acting of Coster Waldau makes up for it.I loved though the so-called whitewashing of Cersei, she is far more subtle in the series than in the books, a real improvement.Margaery has for sure not been whitewashed, she is clever and cunning, just great and potentially capable of everything.Sansa did not betray her father in the same manner as she did in the books - whitewashing that does no harm.Tyrion did not "go last" with Tysha, since he was sixteen in HBO and not his book age of thirteen the impact would have been a serious "blackwashing"Arya did not kill. Tywin started as being quite reasonable, Jorah is not grumpybut attractive and responsible - three incredible actors.And a big whitewashing has been done to the character Sandor since he never had a knife at Sansa's throat and never considered rape.And Littlefinger has been washed to the point of fade out.Shae has her own thread, read there.The showmakers add their own accents and this is in most cases fine with me.Either Tyrion whitewashing is there to make his fall into darkness even more shocking, either it's done to fix something as Martin tried to make him a character readers understand and continue to root for despite a darker passage and failed to anticipate some readers extreme reactions (to the point some even rate him as "beyond redemption" in a recent thread, in lists not even including other PoVs).Tyrion is not a secundary character but one of the main protagonists, likely to have a future in the story.

They certainly aren't whitewashing him for no reason.Or, its done because despite the fact that its HBO, they are still not willing to have a series where so many of the main characters are SO dark, so they made Cersei a little less bad because she's going to be around for a long time, same with Tyrion.  They're whitewashing him because he's too dark for TV.
1906	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-30	but how can you say that Tyrion should not be blamed for marrying Sansa come on?I've explained that innumerable times on this very thread, so asking "how can you say that" just confirms to me that you're not actually reading things other people are writing.  Obviously, I can say it for all the reasons I've articulated previously.If you want to discuss those specific reasons in detail, fine.  My starting point is that I'm judging how blameworthy Tyrion is based on the morality and ethics of his own time, not ours.  If you aren't, then right off the back, that explains why we see it differently, and there's not really any point in moving forward.  But assuming you're using that same standard, here are my three reasons, in short.   Please pick whichever one you want to discuss first so we can stay focused1) Her age is not an issue to me because under Westerosi standards, she was old enough to be wedded and bedded.  So, no blame to Tyrion.2) Betrothals and marriages are commonly arranged in Westeros without seeking the permission of the children (in the case of betrothals) or maids (in the case of weddings), beforehand.  The bedding/consummation of a marriage on the wedding night is also expected and accepted in that culture. So, no blame to Tyrion.3) To the extent Tyrion varied from his cultural norms, he did it in a positive direction.  He protested initially against the marriage, which I believe very few Westerosi nobles would have done if presented with such a favorable match.  The fact of Sansa being married is something he was powerless to change, yet he nevertheless offered her the only choice he could -- marry Lancel instead of me, and he actually told her why Lancel might be a better choice.  Then, despite consummation of the marriage being something fully within cultural norms, he refused his father's orders to do so.  And, he went much further than that by also promising that he would never touch her unless she wanted him to.  To me, that seems far beyond the bounds of what anyone would expect in Westeros.So, pick one, and we'll start.Exactly. There is no subjectivity in this. Not even a chance.Do you not know the meaning of "subjective" versus "objective"?  Someone else's morality may be completely fucked up, but that doesn't render that morality any less subjective.

1907	mrs_serpounce	2013-05-30	And here we go again with whitewashing.
It amazes me to this day how divisive Tyrion is as a character. I'm a Tyrion fan precisely because he *is* an antihero. I'm a massive fan of antiheroes. Phantom of the Opera, Quasimodo, Morgan LeFay, Elphaba, Jack Sparrow - just to name a few - all characters that walk the grey line and do some pretty awful things... but somehow have a moral compass buried in there somewhere that they actually consult from time to time. Not someone I'd want to be friends with IRL, but is a whole lot of fun to watch or read.
(ETA: You want to see a true whitewash? Read "Wicked" and then go *watch* the Wicked Broadway play. Elphaba goes from true grey character to misunderstood nerdy girl. As a misunderstood nerdy girl myself, I adore the Broadway play, but for wholly different reasons than I love the book.)
Truthfully, Tyrion's loop of self-pity-party in ADwD bored the heck out of me, and I was completely turned off by his behavior toward Penny. I absolutely understood *why* it was happening, but I liked it better when he had both flaws and good traits; him being 95% flaw in ADwD was just... boring reading to me. As WoW mentioned, it's the biggest sin a literary character can commit.
Cas Stark, thank you for the Tyrion-fan defense. I'm also of the opinion that apparently, defending a character automatically paints you into a corner with fans who don't care for said character. I think FLoW has done an amazing job of balancing out a defense of Tyrion and an admission of Tyrion's flaws, as well as a defense of Sansa while admitting Sansa's flaws... and yet the Sansa fans keep coming. I'm really beginning to believe that no matter how you phrase it, any defense of Tyrion's point of view (and note that I say "point of view" and not "actions") that doesn't jive with "poor Sansa" is never going to make it as an argument, no matter how well-thought out.
Now I want to see how many people quote that last paragraph and skip over the first few to get on me about how I whitewash Tyrion.

1909	mrs_serpounce	2013-05-30	Agree completely. I was certain he would tell her as soon as they got o the bedroom that he was there to protect her and instead we got the awful "knight of flowers" and attempted rape.If you're speaking of the fact that Tyrion touched her while she was naked (we won't even start on our-time-versus-their-time ethics, because I have a feeling that battle's already fallen on the 'our time' side in your head), the term for that would be "sexual assault," not "attempted rape." Attempted rape is actually attempting penetration - which he never did, with any part of his body. Semantics, but please keep them separate.No one is denying Tyrion is a well written or engaging character, it is those that continually whitewash him because they can't stand liking a villainous / antihero or grey character that are the problem. You can still like a character but admit they are on a dark path. It's when you have a character like Tyrion, that some people like so much, that they over emphasis their favour and like someone supporting a freedom fighter who has become a tyrant, fail to acknowledge any possibility that their favourite is no longer the amazing hero they thoughts they were and instead make excuses for every action they make to explain how it's not their fault.More semantics time /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' /> Antihero and villain are two completely different concepts. And thinking someone is an "amazing hero" is a completely separate concept in itself. You can't see someone as an antihero and yet see them as an amazing hero; and you especially can't see a villain as such.Still, in semantics, I think that's where we all fall on one side of the fence or another: some people see Tyrion as an antihero; some people see Tyrion as a villain. People who squarely put him in the "villain" camp (IMO) overemphasize his dark traits. People who see him as an antihero defend the fact that he has moral leanings at times, but the people who feel he's a villain (a cruelly malicious person who is involved in or devoted to wickedness or crime; scoundrel) don't want to hear about "moral leanings" because they don't see it as such. Thus, the debate.
1910	mrs_serpounce	2013-05-30	3) He was by no means "powerless" to change Sansa's fate, he is the son Tywin Lannister, Hand of the King and uncle of the King, if he had WANTED to, he could have gotten her out of the city, back to her own family, but that would have meant going against the hand that had fed, clothed and kept him in wine and whores all of his life...and so instead of freeing her, he married her and then proceeding to his pity party because she wasn't attracted to him.Not just fed, clothed, and given him money, but someone who had actively destroyed entire houses and was in the process of destroying another at that point. And who had made that specific point to him at the tender age of 13, with his first wife - and I'm one of the people who think that a 13-year-old *is* a victim of an adult at that point. So, while I can't say Tyrion marrying her was noble (it wasn't), I can't say that it's *blameworthy*. This, to me, is part of the grayscale nature of his character, and why he isn't heroic. He made a comple minorly noble choices: he noted that he could potentially protect her - as far as his selfish nature would take, that is - and he didn't force himself on her - which, sorry, in comparison to what he was allowed to do, that is a moral choice; not the heroic action of completely going against his father, but moral.This is the difference between moral, noble, and heroic. I'm defending that he made some moral/minorly noble choices. Not heroic. Heroic would be to fight his dad, as you note. He's on the grayer end of that scale; he's Tyrion.
1911	Cas Stark	2013-05-30	Yeah, I don't say its villanous that he married Sansa, only that I don't agree it is not "blameworthy" because he's not powerless at the time and she is completely powerless.  He does what his father wants, as he has done his entire life because his only source of power has always been the Lannister name and the power that comes with it, which emanates directly from his father, this is why I blame him more than most for murdering his father.  He could easily have sent her to the Tyrells as well and let her marry Willas as she wanted to.  He didn't.  He did what he had done his entire life, again, what was good for the Lannisters, regardless of who else it hurt.
He certainly gets credit for not having sex with her and for initially refusing the marriage, and for his attempts to break through to her and for his kindnesses to her.  Some credit.
1912	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-30	Here are the reasons his decision to marry her is blameworthy:1) It's a match her family didn't approve, her mother and brother were still alive at the time, thus their approval or disapproval of the match would be an important factor in whether it was ethical or not.2) It was not an arranged marriage, where the families arranged the marriage for political/dynastic reasons (see point 1), but a forced marriage at the proverbial sword point.Okay, you asked me to give my reasons, I gave them, and you ignored them and decided to list your own.  Fine.  I assume that since you didn't mention her age, that's now off the table.  So I'll address your three points since that's apparently the framework you prefer for this discussion.  The first two points both focus on the same issue --  her family not agreeing to the marriage.  Before I hit that one, I'm going to skip to the third point because the resolution of that point materially affects the discussion of the other two.3) He was by no means "powerless" to change Sansa's fate, he is the son Tywin Lannister, Hand of the King and uncle of the Kin....,We're talking about the wedding, right?  I mean, that's what the issue is supposed to be, and we're trying to stay focused.  And at the time he was first told by his father about the wedding, he was no longer the Hand of the King.  His father was, and no matter how you slice it, Tyrion being Tywin's son doesn't mean shit If his father, the Hand, and his nephew, the King, both want something he doesn't.  The Lannister guardsmen, Gold Cloaks, the Kingsguard, and the entire rest of the City take their orders from Tywin and Joffrey, not from Tyrion.  Or is it your contention that after being told of this wedding, Tyrion had the authority to order Sansa's release, and send her to HIghgarden?Tywin was resolved that Sansa was to be married.  He told Tyrion that, and Tyrion did not have the power to change that.  Had he refused, Tywin would have married her to Lancel or to someone else.

He did what he had done his entire life, again, what was good for the Lannisters, regardless of who else it hurt.Yup. TBH, Tyrion's true nature is a selfish one. He's spent his entire life watching out for himself because nobody else really has - the best he's ever been given, at most, is indifference, rather than true protection - so the lesson he's learned is that Tyrion is for Tyrion. (To quote one of my other favorite books, The Last Battle: "The Dwarfs are for the Dwarfs!") He does have unselfish impulses from time to time, usually attached to "cripples, bastards and broken things" - and Sansa qualifies as a "broken thing," considering how much she's been through, thus, I think, why he does the unselfish thing by not forcing a consummation - but in the end, it cycles back to Tyrion watching out for Tyrion. And having the Lannister name is part of how he watches out for himself. I don't think I can ever see him abandoning it.While I was certainly surprised at Tyrion's murder of his father, I can't say I was wholly *upset*. I think that's actually part of where a divisive line lies - how can you be troubled by the fact that Tyrion actually murdered one of the villains of the story (whose death you totally wanted to happen)? It's a tough line to walk. While I was cheering at the fact that it *happened*, I was genuinely troubled by the fact that Tyrion had done such a thing - because it wasn't for a heroic reason; it was due to him basically having a psychotic break, due to what had happened with Shae.Soo... do I think Tywin and Shae deserved to die? Yes, most certainly. In such a way? Not really. At Tyrion's hands, it was not a moral choice; it was revenge and hardcore hatred, pure and simple. And, again, self-motivated; he was wounded to his core, and acted out on it, instead of thinking about it - and thinking is, IMNSHO, Tyrion's true strength, and the only thing that saves him from being a dark character.He certainly gets credit for not having sex with her and for initially refusing the marriage, and for his attempts to break through to her and for his kindnesses to her.  Some credit. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' /> I think we're in the same place here. It doesn't make him heroic... just is a nod to the fact that yeah, Tyrion can do somewhat the right thing sometimes. /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />

1915	Cas Stark	2013-05-30	I don't accept that the son of Tywin Lannister could not have gotten Sansa out of King's Landing in the hands of either the Tyrells or her own family if he had wanted to, he is presented as one of the smartest people in the series, he has resources and allies and money.
But, he doesn't even try to actually HELP SANSA, he only throws up some objections to salve his conscience before he agrees to the marriage.

And at the time of the wedding, he was not the Hand of the King.  His father was, and no matter how you slice it, Tyrion being Tywin's son doesn't mean shit If his father, the Hand, and his nephew, the King, both want something he doesn't.  The Lannister guardsmen, Gold Cloaks, the Kingsguard, and the entire rest of the City take their orders from Tywin and Joffrey, not from Tyrion.  Or is it your contention that after being told of this wedding, Tyrion had the authority to order Sansa's release?Tywin was resolved that Sansa was to be married.  He told Tyrion that, and Tyrion did not have the power to change that.  Had he refused, Tywin would have married her to Lancel or to someone else.Sometimes I think that people don't really understand that one of the core themes - if not THE core theme - of ASoIaF is the nature of power and how people can and cannot realistically wield it. How do you laud GRRM for the truth - if you don't play the game correctly, if you try to be a noble hero, chances are, you're gonna get yourself killed, rather than win the day - and then demonize a character for not playing by GRRM's rules?
1917	Cas Stark	2013-05-30	Yup. TBH, Tyrion's true nature is a selfish one. He's spent his entire life watching out for himself because nobody else really has - the best he's ever been given, at most, is indifference, rather than true protection - so the lesson he's learned is that Tyrion is for Tyrion. (To quote one of my other favorite books, The Last Battle: "The Dwarfs are for the Dwarfs!") He does have unselfish impulses from time to time, usually attached to "cripples, bastards and broken things" - and Sansa qualifies as a "broken thing," considering how much she's been through, thus, I think, why he does the unselfish thing by not forcing a consummation - but in the end, it cycles back to Tyrion watching out for Tyrion. And having the Lannister name is part of how he watches out for himself. I don't think I can ever see him abandoning it.While I was certainly surprised at Tyrion's murder of his father, I can't say I was wholly *upset*. I think that's actually part of where a divisive line lies - how can you be troubled by the fact that Tyrion actually murdered one of the villains of the story (whose death you totally wanted to happen)? It's a tough line to walk. While I was cheering at the fact that it *happened*, I was genuinely troubled by the fact that Tyrion had done such a thing - because it wasn't for a heroic reason; it was due to him basically having a psychotic break, due to what had happened with Shae.Soo... do I think Tywin and Shae deserved to die? Yes, most certainly. In such a way? Not really. At Tyrion's hands, it was not a moral choice; it was revenge and hardcore hatred, pure and simple. And, again, self-motivated; he was wounded to his core, and acted out on it, instead of thinking about it - and thinking is, IMNSHO, Tyrion's true strength, and the only thing that saves him from being a dark character. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' /> I think we're in the same place here. It doesn't make him heroic... just is a nod to the fact that yeah, Tyrion can do somewhat the right thing sometimes. /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />Yes very close to the same place.Tywin Lannister definitely deserved death, but not at the hands of his son, and not in that circumstance, for such a random 'in the moment' reason.  The same goes for Book Shae, she was a POS, no morals, cared for no one but herself, but Tyrion doesn't really kill her for those reasons in my opinion, nor does he really kill her because she betrayed him in the trial, but because he snaps at the full realization that she never cared for him one bit, ever at all, and that is not a reason to kill someone, no matter what kind of worthless POS they are.  But, many disagree on that.
1918	mrs_serpounce	2013-05-30	I don't accept that the son of Tywin Lannister could not have gotten Sansa out of King's Landing in the hands of either the Tyrells or her own family if he had wanted to, he is presented as one of the smartest people in the series, he has resources and allies and money.But, he doesn't even try to actually HELP SANSA, he only throws up some objections to salve his conscience before he agrees to the marriage.He tries to help Sansa within the bounds of the power he feels he has, and within the boundary of his character. He is not a heroic character. A heroic character would've gotten her out of KL no matter what the cost....and then probably would've wound up dead, just like Ned.And since Tyrion likes living, I don't think that's in his thought path. /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' /> An antihero makes grayer moves.I also think there are limits to him trading on the Lannister name; it's not like it's won him tons of friends. Actually, I think the only power the Lannister name has given him is one of fear enough that people can get over their revulsion of "the Imp" enough to do what he pays them to do. And money has its limits (Look at Bronn's end path!) and Tyrion's funds have limits. If he had still been the Hand of the King, he might've had the ability to smuggle her out. But his power in KL is on the wane at this point, and it limits his options further.

But his power in KL is on the wane at this point, and it limits his options further.I agree, he's not heroic.  I don't think if he had gotten Sansa out he would have wound up dead though, as much as his father despised him, he still started a veritable war while Robert Baratheon was still alive on his behalf because he was a Lannister and despite Tyrion being convicted of regicide and kinslaying he was still going to spare his life and send him to the wall.But, it would have been a monumental sacrifice on Tyrion's part, to put her welfare ahead of his own, because while he wouldn't have ended up dead, he would have been REALLY restricted in terms of power and access, and he wasn't willing to do that, because as you say, he's a selfish guy.  He will try to minimize harm when he can, but only if the cost to himself is also minimal and when push comes to shove we have not seen him put himself on the line for anything other than Tyrion and the Lannister family.
1920	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-30	I don't accept that the son of Tywin Lannister could not have gotten Sansa out of King's Landing in the hands of either the Tyrells or her own family if he had wanted to, he is presented as one of the smartest people in the series, he has resources and allies and money.So I assume you've now dropped the "Hand of the King" stuff, and agree that at the time Tyrion learned of the marriage, he didn't have that authority.  And that we're now talking about the timeframe from that point forward.If you choose to read into the text that the guards in KL, Varys, Littlefinger, and Tywin all would have been oblivious to Tyrion's attempts, and that this girl who was constantly guarded by Lannister guardsmen could have been successfully snuck out of the KL by Tyrion, well, I can't disprove that.  In my opinion, Tyrion does not have nearly the resources, allies, or intelligence network that Varys or Littlefinger has, and he knows it.  The chance of such a plan succeeding would have been tiny, IMHO, and the repercussions for Tyrion when it failed would not have been good.  I don't blame him for not doing that, though apparently you do.What we don't see in the books is what happened immediately after that meeting between Tywin, Cersei and Tyrion regarding the marriages.  But we do know this -- the result of this meeting was something that was going to foil Tyrell plans, and that Tywin believed it very important to make the arrangements quickly before the Tyrells acted.  Further, we know that the Tyrells knew, also before Sansa, that she would be marrying Tyrion, because there is no evidence of shock or surprise on their part at the wedding.  Yet, the Tyrells themselves didn't tell Sansa either, which shows they knew the jig was up at that point as well because there was nothing to be gained by telling her.  In other words, the the possibility of a marriage to a Tyrell was already dead.  That suggests to me that Tywin likely announced those marriage plans to the Tyrells almost immediately after that meeting with Cersei and Tyrion.  So, for that completely independent reason, I think there was zero chance of Sansa making it to Highgarden to marry Willas.

I don't think he could have gotten her out anyway, but it would have been a highly heroic act if he did.  On the other hand, I don't blame him for not rising to the level of an exceptional, selfless hero, because he's not.  Although I do think his wooden cock threat to Joffrey to protect the feelings of Sansa was pretty damn heroic in context.

There were other comments in the text that bandits, murderers, and cutthroats were all over the area, and the nature of the escape means that he could not have sent her with any kind of a substantial, trustworthy guard force.  The odds on her not making it safely to wherever he'd send her would not have been high even if he had managed to get her out of KL.

I don't think it would've worked, whatever way it was presented. Heck, I don't think anyone could've pulled her out at that moment. The only reason it worked in the PW is that she slipped out amongst a host of confusion, where everyone was focusing somewhere else. At this point, the focus is on *her* (and on Tyrion); it's nigh on impossible that she'd get away (even Littlefinger doesn't attempt it, and one can argue that either he or Varys would have the highest chance of success, no matter what point the story's at).

If he didn't care about that he could have gotten her out probably at any time, but then he would have paid the price, same with Varys.

There is no reason to believe he couldn't have gotten her out earlier if he had wanted to...but he didn't want to save her or send her back to her family, he wants her for himself.

1925	Zman1863	2013-05-30	Or, its done because despite the fact that its HBO, they are still not willing to have a series where so many of the main characters are SO dark, so they made Cersei a little less bad because she's going to be around for a long time, same with Tyrion.  They're whitewashing him because he's too dark for TV.I don't think its that they deem him too dark for TV- there are plenty of TV characters out there who are marked by their moral ambiguities like Don Draper, Tony Soprano or House. I think that its more to do with the fact that Tyrion as a character and Dinklage's performance stood out for the unsullied most about the show in its debut season and perhaps they wanted to capitalize on that for the sake of the show's popularity by maintaining as much as possible the perception of Tyrion from Season 1 which is more clearly positive than any of the later volumes.You misread my post, he is the son of Tywin Lannister, who is Hand of the King at the time of the marriage, I never intended to convey that he was acting hand at the time.

Getting Sansa out would have meant giving up the only insurance for Jaime's life that the Lannisters had. And Tyrion at the time had no knowledge that Catelyn had already agreed to his exchange proposal and freed Jaime.
1926	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-30	So, no I don't believe that he was powerless to get Sansa out of KL.That's just a statement of belief, not an argument.  You didn't address how he'd have to evade detection from both Varys and LF, the redcloaks guarding her 24/7, and even if he got her out of KL, getting her somewhere safe, safely.  In the middle of a country at war, with bandits and brigands everywhere. It's not like Sansa has demonstrated the escape and evasion, street-smart abilities of her sister.But, we know from his POV that he never tried, never even thought about it, never weighed the option.Well, GRRM also didn't write that Tyrion thought about raising a massive army of mountain clansmen and conquering Westeros for his own.  Because some options are so impossible at the outset that it's not worth the time.  But in any event, I think the risk of ultimate success was so tiny, and the repercussions to Tyrion himself so bad, that I don't assign him any moral blame for not doing that.  You do.You wanted my reasons for why him marrying Sansa was blameworthy and I gave them to you.  If you don't agree, then that's fine, we can agree to disagree.Actually, you were the one who said to me "how can you possibly say he isn't blameworthy", and I gave you my reasons.  The whole issue here has been that some people accuse others of unreasonably "whitewashing" Tyrion's character, by refusing to admit to flaws that are "objectively" obvious.  That doesn't leave room for reasonable disagreements on textual interpretation, or moral judgments.In any case, if one were to conclude that Tyrion did not have the practical ability to prevent Sansa's marriage, then the first two points you listed based on the lack of parental consent were something that was going to happen anyway, because it was Tywin's decision that Sansa would be married, necessarily without consulting her mother, brother, or arranging for their consent.  Had Tyrion refused, Tywin would have married her to Lancel, against her will and without her consent.  That was something Tyrion could not change.Tyrion knew this, and could not reasonably be expected to be able to prevent that from happening other than in the "escape" hypothetical..  So at that point, the choices open to him were 1) refuse to marry Sansa and see her married to Lancel without her parents' consent, agree to marry her himself without her parents' consent, or 3) agree to marry her but give her the option to chose Lancel instead, either of which would be a marriage without her parents' consent.  I do not think chosing option 3 is objectively that worse than the other two.

I don't think anyone is (as sad as that is for Sansa). My point was, who would be the most likely to succeed at smuggling her out of KL at this point in the story. Answer: Varys and Littlefinger, although I doubt anyone would actually be successful at it.I also disagree that Tyrion is as protected as you think he is. He may be insulated to a certain point, but I don't think that if he proved such a traitor to his House, his father would be so merciful. Remember, to Tywin, House is *all*.I don't think its that they deem him too dark for TV- there are plenty of TV characters out there who are marked by their moral ambiguities like Don Draper, Tony Soprano or House. I think that its more to do with the fact that Tyrion as a character and Dinklage's performance stood out for the unsullied most about the show in its debut season and perhaps they wanted to capitalize on that for the sake of the show's popularity by maintaining as much as possible the perception of Tyrion from Season 1 which is more clearly positive than any of the later volumes.I'm going to be unpopular here and keep reminding people that this is not 100% of Unsullied's opinion. Because if you spoke to every Unsullied I know personally, they see Tyrion as an antihero, not a hero; he's not Ned 2.0 to them. Unsullied mileage may vary. (UMMV?)True he probably could have come up with a scheme to help her escape, but it would be a bit much to expect him to contemplate something so altruistic, with no benefit and perhaps some detriment to his interests. Getting Sansa out would have meant giving up the only insurance for Jaime's life that the Lannisters had. And Tyrion at the time had no knowledge that Catelyn had already agreed to his exchange proposal and freed Jaime.This. I don't get people expecting a gray character to be so altruistic - even more, people considering that *being* that altruistic as a *requirement* for considering him gray, which is antithetical to the definition of an antihero. Can't have it both ways.
1928	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-30	The difference is that LF and Varys are not protected in the same way that Tyrion would have been.  LF gets her out only when he can do it and have no fingerprints that connect him to it.  If he didn't care about that he could have gotten her out probably at any time, but then he would have paid the price, same with Varys.  They're alive because they're useful, they wield their power quietly, otherwise Tywin or Robert or someone else would have their heads off, and no one is going to rise to go to war in protest.That's true.  I think the repercussions for Varys or LF in aiding or concealing Sansa's escape would have been worse.  And that really is the core of the problem with Tyrion arranging the escape.  Tyrion knows that both of those guys have far more contacts, ears, and eyes, in KL and the castle than he does.  The only real loyalists he has are Bron, Pod, and perhaps Shae, and none of them have anything close to the familiarity or reach of LF or Varys.   Even if he can come up with a scheme to separate red cloaks (who take their orders from Tywin, not Tyrion) from Sansa, there still is everything else, and he's really got nobody to trust.  The chances of him putting together a plot that Varys or LF would sniff out seems vanishingly small to me.  And again, I think it is sort of taken as a given that everything outside of KL is simply not safe.  Tyrion has no trusted contacts in nearby ports, no connections in Essos or the Free Cities, and just really doesn't have anywhere to send her.  It's a nonstarter.
1929	Cas Stark	2013-05-30	Well, his father was going to spare his life after he was convicted of kiling Joff, so I can't see he would have had him killed or thrown in prison for getting Sansa out of KL.
But, that level of risk is not something I would expect Tyrion to take, he hasn't taken that kind of risk for anyone other than himself, my main point was that he deserves a level of blame for marrying Sansa against her will, against the will of her family and that in my opinion he would have had a good chance to get her out of KL.
But, then I also place blame on Sansa herself for sitting around in KL all that time and doing nothing to try and help herself, never trying to find an ally or figure out HERSELF if she could escape.  Her fans will tell you it was pointless and she knew it, but it was pointless for Arya to try and get away from the Hound but she does it anyway.  Sansa never tries anything, never does anything on her own to even gauge her chances of escape.
1930	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-30	I also disagree that Tyrion is as protected as you think he is. He may be insulated to a certain point, but I don't think that if he proved such a traitor to his House, his father would be so merciful. Remember, to Tywin, House is *all*.It would have been a horrible embarassment to House Lannister for Tyrion to be complicit in a plot to smuggle Sansa out of KL after Tywin had planned a marriage. The Tyrells would have gloated to no end.  I'm not sure what Tywin would have done, though I expect death would not have been the result, but anything less would have been open for consideration because he could legitimately be accounted a traitor in sending her to her family.
1931	Zman1863	2013-05-30	I'm going to be unpopular here and keep reminding people that this is not 100% of Unsullied's opinion. Because if you spoke to every Unsullied I know personally, they see Tyrion as an antihero, not a hero; he's not Ned 2.0 to them. Unsullied mileage may vary. (UMMV?)Definitely agree that there is a greater diversity of opinion among unsullied than many believe. I was speaking more in the general sense that Dinklage as Tyrion was the what a lot of the buzz around the show focused on and winning the emmy etc.

1932	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-30	But, then I also place blame on Sansa herself for sitting around in KL all that time and doing nothing to try and help herself, never trying to find an ally or figure out HERSELF if she could escape.  Her fans will tell you it was pointless and she knew it, but it was pointless for Arya to try and get away from the Hound but she does it anyway.  Sansa never tries anything, never does anything on her own to even gauge her chances of escape.That's an interesting point, because I'm not sure I'd fault or blame her for not taking a more aggressive approach to trying to escape.  I don't think many girls in her situation would have done that (Arya obviously being exceptional).  I mean, wasn't hostage taking/keeping a pretty common occurence in both Westeros and the medieval world?  Did girls of that age routinely plot escapes?But at the same time, reading about the boring life and coping fantasies of a girl held hostage isn't all that interesting to me either.  I don't really care how much she likes her dresses or any of that other stuff.  And given some of her rather selfish, naive actions in AGOT, that had the effect (though obviously not intentionally) of screwing over her own family, she entered that whole hostage phase with some reader antipathy.  I really don't have much interest in reading about her unless she's going to do something exceptional, particularly when some of her naivete and fantasy is reminiscent of the same type of naivete and fantasy that led her to do some pretty stupid things in AGOT.The real problem with Sansa, I think, is that while her "sins" are minor, her "virtues" don't seem all that major either.  Kinda...bleh.Well, his father was going to spare his life after he was convicted of kiling Joff, so I can't see he would have had him killed or thrown in prison for getting Sansa out of KL.Don't forget that at this point, Jaime was still believed a prisoner, and Sansa a hostage to his security.  Tywin may well have interpreted freeing Sansa as equivalent to giving the Starks the ability to kill Jaime.  And Tywin was going to spare Tyrion's life for poisoning Joffrey-- by making him take the black.  So I don't quite fault Tyrion for not wanting to try a plan that has minimal chance of success, while perhaps resulting in him taking the black.

1933	mrs_serpounce	2013-05-30	Well, his father was going to spare his life after he was convicted of kiling Joff, so I can't see he would have had him killed or thrown in prison for getting Sansa out of KL.True, but a flip of perspective:1) Tyrion maintains his innocence in killing Joff, convicted in trial by combat or no. I think there's enough doubt included in there that Tywin wouldn't off his kid for that. (ETA: kinda like the fact that Tywin doubts Tyrion is his son, but can't prove it, so - highly reluctantly - treats him as a Lannister.)2) More importantly, killing Joff, kinslaying though it may be, is not a direct affront on House Lannister (he's a Baratheon in name, despite his true parentage) and does no damage to the Lannister power structure whatsoever. If you think about it, Joff's death actually strengthens Tywin's power. Tywin didn't much care for Joff; he couldn't control him. Tommen is the one put on the throne in his brother's place, and Tommen is *much* more malleable.I think that it would've been a bit more of a bloodbath if Tyrion directly undermined his father and family's power by giving away the "Key to the North" to another family. That's a direct attack on House Lannister.

1934	greensleeves	2013-05-30	I haven't been posting because I didn't see these past two episodes until just recently.  Anyways, in regards to the longer thread tl;dr.... but checking the most recent direction of the thread I'll just say this:
Remember that Tyrion himself thinks about taking Sansa to Casterly Rock or Bravos (this is in response to a perceived threat to his own life) and doesn't seem to think it's a big deal.  Thus, presumably, it wouldn't have been too hard for him to take Sansa out of King's Landing at anytime after their wedding.  As her husband, he is her guardian and jailer.
1935	Woman of War	2013-05-30	Yes, exactly, as her husband he is her guardian and it is guaranteed that she cannot be used anymore by another house for grabbing the North, so maybe, maybe Tywin would have let them go. But Tywin would never have forgiven Tyrion to wring Sansa out of Lannister Power. Apart from that nobody at KL knew that Jaime had been freed and Sansa was in theory still the guarantee for his safety though by being married and destined to make babies she had become quite untouchable as hostage. There was no way anymore for Tywin to kill her off as hostage - only the Starks may not have been aware of it. And for Tyrion Jaime's safety had always been of huge importance. So slipping Sansa out, not knowing what this meant for Jaime....?
And Sansa is not the person who can travel light, clad as commoner, wrapped up as young man, riding all day long, looking after herself with maybe two plain unremarkable guards. She would need a huge staff for amenities and protection, the preparation would draw attention and make the smuggling out a high risk enterprise, even if Sansa could have kept her mouth shut. And where to take her? A high maintenance girl right through the war?

1936	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-30	Remember that Tyrion himself thinks about taking Sansa to Casterly Rock or Bravos (this is in response to a perceived threat to his own life) and doesn't seem to think it's a big deal.  Thus, presumably, it wouldn't have been too hard for him to take Sansa out of King's Landing at anytime after their wedding.  As her husband, he is her guardian and jailer.Yes, Tyrion could have taken Sansa out of King's Landing after the wedding.  So what?  Where could they have reasonably gone that would have been better than KL, and a suitable destination for the two of them that improves on things?  If they go to Casterly Rock, then she's still stuck married to Tyrion.  About the only other place ot which travel would be safe would perhaps be a trip to the Free Cities, but what good does that really do them?  Tyrion would have no job, and no income, and Sansa is stuck in a foreign land.Anyway, this is all speculative, but I imagine that if Tyrion did not feel he could protect Sansa in KL, he'd probably have taken her to Casterly Rock at some point.  But I'm not sure what any of that has to do with actions prior to the wedding.
1937	Cas Stark	2013-05-30	To take this back to the show, my objection to the show depiction of the wedding issue isn't really the whitewashing of Tyrion, I understand why they did it, don't particularly object to it, don't find it has been to an egregious degree, and Dinklage is so good anyway....what my objection is, that at the same time they've made Tyrion nicer they made Sansa [as hard as it is for me to believe] more shallow and less sympathetic.
The show portrayal of the wedding, where she has a lot of notice, where she gets a pep talk from Marg and her most serious objection is that Tyrion is a dwarf whose not as hot as Loras makes her out to be fairly unsympathetic in a situation where 99% of the sympathy belongs w/her.  When non book readers are saying that Sansa is wrong to reject Tyrion and criticizing her reaction to the marriage, thats a sign that the show erred in how they portrayed things.  To me, anyway, again, I restate, no fan of Sansa Stark.

The Sansa debate has been going on for a very long time on these boards, long before the show, in part because even readers had widely varying opinions of her.	And I know there are book readers who also think it was wrong for her to treat Tyrion that way.  I personally had a more negative reaction to book Sansa than to show Sansa. Show Sansa seemed kinder and more mature to me than did book Sansa.And ultimately, that's a problem in an adaptation.  As you adapt, you try to keep characters generally consistent with their portrayal in the book, but that is difficult when portrayals of characters are not so clear cut.

Even I thought that was a raw deal for her and she is by far my least favorite Stark.
1940	Lord Freypie	2013-05-30	I think making Sansa worried about Tyrion dwarfism was just a way to replace all Sansa thoughts about him being ugly in the book, which don't really make her better, that wouldn't have been credible to make her find Peter Dinklage ugly.
Worrying about her childs eventually being dwarves do make show Sansa a good daughter of Cat "let's look at the hips of Edmure/Robb wife", it was not a that bad choice of objection.

I think she had legitimate reasons to be pissed.  What turned me off was my perception of the manner/basis for her objections.  The giddiness to be marrying Willas, when to me at least, she should have been opposed to anything given the current situation involving her family.  The whole puppies/dress stuff had me thinking "doesn't she have a fucking clue as to what else is going on?  Doesn't she care that the family into which she is marrying is trying to kill her brother?"I'd have loved it if, before walking out, or even up at the altar, she'd have just busted out with "I don't think you people have any right to do this to me without my family's permission, and after murdering my father.  But the Queen told me I'd be dragged up here kicking and screaming anyway, so I guess I have no choice."  I'd have been high-fiving myself over that. Had she added "Even though Tyrion is the only one who stood up for me when the King and his guards stripped and beat me in public, this still isn't right", it would have been doubly fun just to think of all of them cringing. So that's the basis for my dislike -- not that she should have been thrilled to marry Tyrion.  Is all that realistic?  No, particularly coming from a doormat like her.

And I am sure they would have been nice to Sansa as long as it suits them. But if it doesn't any longer - too bad she was such a nice girl but we would not want to be the ones to blame .....  They are not unreasonably cruel, that would be poor taste.

Sansa is being used to strengthen one of the two families at war with her own, trying to kill her brother, and she's perfectly content with that at the beginning of that chapter.  She's positively giddy about the prospect.   Sansa seems to be thinking "hey, as long as I'm safe in Highgarden with Willas, the puppies, and the barge, and can name my kids after members of my family, it's all great."No, it isn't.  Wake the fuck up.Argh, now I'm getting pissed off at book Sansa again.

She'd have let them have it, though they probably would have had to drag her up there....Remember what ADWD Theon thought of "Arya" at her wedding? He thought that the real Arya would have spat in Ramsay's face (and the last time he saw Arya was in AGOT, before she turned into, well, what she is now). I can't imagine what ASOS!Arya would have done in that situation, but I can say it would not have been pretty. Didn't Val, who's nowhere near Arya's level of fierce, threaten or imply that if she was married to a certain guy against her will, she would murder him on the wedding night? I tend to think something similar would have happened to Arya's husband, assuming they somehow managed to get her to go through with the ceremony.One thing that struck me about Sansa's attitude in the show towards marrying Loras and marrying Tyrion is that there's no indication that she's unhappy about being married off for her claim, when that seemed to me to be very central to her mindset in the books. (She got psyched about the Willas match for other reasons, but she hated being married off for her claim and only comforted herself with the idea that Willas would eventually love her.) My impression in AFFC was that Alayne/Sansa was officially over political marriages and hated the idea, which might be relevant given that Littlefinger seems to be gearing up to shuffle her off into another political marriage. I guess the writers could throw in a line or two of dialogue later on to emphasize that Sansa hated being married for her claim, but it seems like a curious omission to me given that it was my understanding at least that Sansa's attitude towards political marriages, as shaped by her experience with marriage, was going to be important in the books going forward.

1947	The Knight of Flours	2013-05-30	The whole puppies/dress stuff had me thinking "doesn't she have a fucking clue as to what else is going on?  I don't think people give Sansa enough credit.  She's kept under house arrest, mistreated and if she IS given information about what's happening to her family etc in the outside, it's usually only to torment her.She hates all the Lannisters (though admits Tyrion has treated her with some respect and likes the children) and I'm not surprised that after all her mental and physical torture, she grasps at her only chance to escape KL and the Lannisters.And we all know what happened when she did stand up to Joff and say 'maybe he'll bring me your head" when talking about Robb.ETA and I'm not sure (as someone did above) that i'd call Sansa high-maintenance.  She seemed to adapt to the Alayne role fairly easily and seems to be doing a good job as temporary-Lady of the Eyrie.

She seemed to adapt to the Alayne role fairly easily and seems to be doing a good job as temporary-Lady of the Eyrie."Alayne" is the daughter of the noble ruling the Eyrie.  As you say the "temporary Lady" of the Eyrie.  That is not a commoner role, but rather one that remains within the pampered nobility.
1949	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-31	One thing that struck me about Sansa's attitude in the show towards marrying Loras and marrying Tyrion is that there's no indication that she's unhappy about being married off for her claim, when that seemed to me to be very central to her mindset in the books. (She got psyched about the Willas match for other reasons, but she hated being married off for her claim and only comforted herself with the idea that Willas would eventually love her.)She kind of flip-flops on that.  When Dontos tells here that they all just want her for her claim, she seems to listen.  But at the beginning of the wedding chapter, she's right back to fantasies again.  Then after it is revealed that she's going to marry Tyrion, the light bulb goes off again in that very same chapter and she remembers what Dontos told her.The thing is that the whole Dontos speech should have been completely unnecessary, because it should be blindingly obvious to her long before then that marriages are political.  After all, did she think she'd be wed to Joffrey if her last name was Snow?  If she did, then that's part of the naivete and fantasizing that lead her to be disliked by some readers.My impression in AFFC was that Alayne/Sansa was officially over political marriages and hated the idea, which might be relevant given that Littlefinger seems to be gearing up to shuffle her off into another political marriage.

I know we all hope that she's going to figure LF out and start working against him, but I don't think that's been established clearly as of AFFC, where her chapters were pretty minimal.
1950	Lord Bronn Stokeworth	2013-05-31	I hate this scene with a fiery passion. I fucking knew they would have Sansa kneel for Tyrion. I fucking knew it. Sansa's biggest badass "Fuck you I will not bow to to my captors" scene is stripped from her. Her act of defiance is taken away to protect Tyrion's feelings. Because every abused 14 year old prisoner should be concerned about the feelings of her captors. Her own feelings meaningless. Nevermind that Margery pretty much told her this marriage will ensure that no mercy will be shown her brother. He will die so her children can rule the North. Most important thing is poor little Tyrion not get his feelings hurt. After all, his embarrassment is somehow much worse than Sansa's feelings of facing slavery for life to one the men who helped murder her family.
But not to fucking worry. They made sure to add a scene to show Sansa's only concern is looks. Because there is no fucking possible reason for her to not want to marry one of her jailors. I mean who wouldn't want a life of imprisonment? I mean Tyrion just such a nice guy, why would she ever care that he is supporting the cause of people who will murder her family to ensure his sons take their lands and titles. Really, it is only the looks from totally hopping on the guy that offers a life of misery and paranoia knowing that once she has a son, she can be killed at will.
Somehow, I feel that this post lacks the amount of obscenities it deserves. To be fair to myself, the whitewashing of Tyrion and removing Sansa's act of defiance while painting her as a frivolous little girl concerned only about looks is pretty fucking obscene in own right, nothing any amount of fucks can ever match.
1951	Woman of War	2013-05-31	Sigh! In this whole long thread all the points you presented with that regrettabe lack of obscenities have  already been  discussed, fortunately without obscenities. Just read it.
1952	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-31	Eh, why not?Nobody at the wedding, including the Lannisters, took it as a "fuck you" act of defiance against being married.  They just took it as her humiliating Tyrion, and they all laughed.  Her refusal to kneel actually made the wedding more enjoyable for all those people.After realizing the actual effect of her refusal to kneel, Sansa herself was "ashamed" of that action.That's not a "whitewashing" of Tyrion, nor is it a statement that Sansa didn't have a right to be pissed, or that she wasn't justified in not wanting to marry Tyrion.  It actually has nothing to do with Tyrion at all.  It is just a statement as to the actual effect of the particular action she took, as described by the author.  Everyone laughed, and Sansa was ashamed of it.That may be different from how some readers wanted it to be perceived, but there isn't any evidence that any of the characters, including Sansa, actually viewed that act in the way those readers do.

I assumed my complaints would have been voiced by others and debated by others still.It's not like this is particularly new stuff. I am sure it has all been said over and over on various Tyrion/Sansa Threads in the book section I generally hang out. Feel free to ignore me. I just felt like raging for a bit because it was rather disgusting.Eh, why not?Nobody at the wedding, including the Lannisters, took it as a fuck you against being married.  They just took it as her humiliating Tyrion, and they all laughed.  That active the wedding more enjoyable for all those people.After realizing the actual effect of her refusal to kneel, Sansa herself was "ashamed" of that action.Partially, what this scene means to me. Her not bowing made me realize how fucking strong Sansa really is. Most people would have been broken and been all Stockholm Syndrome by this time. But not Sansa. This scene, the act of refusing to bow for the Lannisters is what her go from being OK to being one of my top characters. This of course ruins it for me.And yeah, she later regret the reaction she got. But it still has meaning in what it was. Not forgetting who she is. Standing up to (literally!) the Lannisters in whatever way she can.I know that 29 pages of thread is a whole heck of a lot to read through, but you could've saved yourself a few obscenities by reading even a handful of said pages (either front few or back few).

As I said, I knew the arguments before even posting. I just needed to get off my vehement displeasure off my chest. Most people I know are show watchers and don't want to hear anything book related as I can get careless and accidentally spoil stuff.2. Don't worry. I have plenty of obscenities in reserve. I also find "fuck" as a silly obscenity. There are bad words. They are words created to inflict pain on people. Derogatory slurs have no place in civil society. Of course, fuck is not one of those. Of course, normal words like pig can be used to hurt and attack people. That should not be done (especially pig, because pigs are actually pretty cute and adorable, they are also very clean and smart, really being called a pig should be a compliment, but I digress). Again, I did not do this. Though I am obviously not pleased with D&D's route, I did not insult them. I believe my words were within the bounds of civil society if a bit on the crude side.Like pigs, fuck has an unfortunate bias against it when it is really an truly a great thing.3. Thank you for the summary. Sorry, I was a bit slow to post it's unnecessity.4. Actually, I don't mind Tyrion's whitewashing too much. Peter Dinklage is awesome and keeps it entertaining. That's all I want. It becomes a problem when other characters are made worse to make Tyrion look better.

1955	Mendoza	2013-05-31	For me, the dirty little secret about season 3 is how bad the King's Landing stuff has been. Pod w/whores, what's in the box, Tywin having a conversation about homosexuality, now the show's choice to butcher Sansa's storyline.
The sooner Sansa is away from Tyrion, the better. On the tv show, she's just a means to advance Tyrion as a gary stu and show his issues with his father.
She's just a plot device here.
The interplay between Cersei and Sansa in season two was much better and even handed.

Loving it.Willow (with Warwick Davis). There are probably others, but that's the only one that jumps to mind.Peter Dinklage was the lead in The Station Agent, but I don't know that that would qualify as a major motion picture. Great film, though.I forgot one thing. What does TL:DR mean?Too long; didn't read.For me, the dirty little secret about season 3 is how bad the King's Landing stuff has been. Pod w/whores, what's in the box, Tywin having a conversation about homosexuality, now the show's choice to butcher Sansa's storyline.I haven't minded it, really. The KL storylines for the first few eps smacked of filler and setup, but I pretty much expected that would happen with the decision to push Sansa and Tyrion's wedding back to 3x08, when it happens much sooner in the books. As for why the writers pushed it back so far, now that it seems all but confirmed that the Purple Wedding won't be in this season, the writers wanted the Sansa/Tyrion wedding to be the climax, fancypants set piece of the Season 3 King's Landing arc.

1959	TNine	2013-06-01	One of the things that i thought about was--would book!Sansa have actually acted differently?  If Tyrion had come to her ahead of time to tell her of the marriage, and promised to be kind?  If she had seen Joff take away the stool (i can't imagine Sansa willingly showing solidarity with one of Joff's cruelties)?  I mean, i don't like how weak of a character Sansa has been shown to be this season, but how much of this is changing her character, and how much is changing the situation she is in?Also, Sansa fans tend to seriously underestimate how naive Sansa really is.  As late as the PW we see:His words made Tyrion feel absurdly grateful, and helped to mollify him as Galyeon sang endless verses about the valor of the boy king and his mother, the golden queen."She never did that," Sansa blurted out suddenly."Never believe anything you hear in a song, my lady." Tyrion summoned a serving man to refill their wine cups.In things that she hasn't seen to be actually quite awful, Sansa remains painfully naive.  Things like her line to Marge of "did your grandmother tell you this" is entirely in character.

Great film, though.Two films I have not heard of. The one with Peter Dinklage looks promising. Wasn't he also in Death at a Funeral? Oh, and I just saw he will be in an upcoming X-Man film...Soooo off topic right now.
1961	Clariana	2013-06-01	I think his film debut may have been "Living in Oblivion", great film I seem to recall, where he played an antsy actor hired to play a dwarf in a dream scene... http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113677/

1962	Woman of War	2013-06-01	The Station agent is a wonderful small but intense movie and there are two versions of Death At a Funeral, the British and the US version, both with Dinklage. I've only seen the British one and it is an elegant comedy where no one ever laughs in it - great.

1964	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-06-01	but how much of this is changing her character, and how much is changing the situation she is in?Yes yes yes yes yes.In the book'we're privy to Sansa's internal thoughts, which include (after the giggling giddiness of her new dress) a recognition that they all just want her for her claim.  We're also privy to her feeling ashamed after refusing to kneel.  But inherently, the show cannot portray those internal thoughts.If they show the giggling without the internal realization regarding her claim, it would make her look more shallow.   If they show her not kneeling but without the internal shame, while all the Lannisters laugh, that also distorts her portrayal.So they omitted both the giggling and the refusal to kneel because they could not show the internal thoughts that placed those actions in their right context.   I think that was much more fair to her characterization than showing those actions without the context provided by her POV.It's all in the eye of the beholder, but I personally thought the show Sansa portrayal was more sympathetic to her character, because she clearly displayed by her demeanor and expressions that she was not happy about the wedding, but also had no desire to single out Tyrion with her ire.
1965	Newstar	2013-06-02	One of the things that i thought about was--would book!Sansa have actually acted differently?

As late as the PW we see:In things that she hasn't seen to be actually quite awful, Sansa remains painfully naive.  Things like her line to Marge of "did your grandmother tell you this" is entirely in character.That's the thing. A lot of Sansa fans complained about Sansa being "dumbed down" in that scene in 3x06 where she innocently asks Shae if her family will be able to come to the wedding and is cheerfully rambling about the superior dressmakers in Highgarden. However, I think that that scene is the show version of the book scene where Sansa is giggling about her dress and how beautiful she looks in it without any regard to the Tyrells' interest in her claim (and hope of claiming Winterfell over Robb's dead body), since in both scenes, she's happily thinking of her intended and of her dress, and in both scenes a Lannister sibling (Cersei in the books, Tyrion in the show) comes in to tell her that she's not to marry the man she wishes to marry--Willas/Loras Tyrell--but marry Tyrion instead. So it's not so much "dumbed down" Sansa; it's just Book Sansa under a different set of circumstances. Book Sansa may never have specifically asked about whether her family could come to her wedding to Willas, but she was just as dreamy-eyed about looking snazzy and her imagined life with her intended without any regard to the reality of her situation (TV Sansa blithely ignored Shae's "I'm sure he does" crack in reaction to Sansa mentioning Loras loving brocade).I think if we put Book Sansa under TV Sansa's circumstances in relation to the wedding, which were very different from Book Sansa's, she would react just as TV Sansa did. Same character, different circumstances.

1968	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-06-02	But he two scenes aren't even in the same galaxy in terms of how silly and naive they make Sansa look.I think that's a pretty subjective determination either way.  They've also omitted the whole Florian/Jonquil fantasy that makes her look naive and immature.  Again, it's subjective, but I personally think the overall show portrayal is very fair, perhaps leaning towards more favorable to Sansa.
1969	Master Forel's Fro	2013-06-02	I think that's a pretty subjective determination either way.  They've also omitted the whole Florian/Jonquil fantasy that makes her look naive and immature.  Again, it's subjective, but I personally think the overall show portrayal is very fair, perhaps leaning towards more favorable to Sansa.Im not a Sansa fan but every time I'm reading her pov I have to keep reminding myself she is a kid and not compare her to Arya. That said  I don't think the show portrays just how naive sansa really is, she is just a kid so maybe her focusing on the pretty dress and imagining her life in highgarden is her way of protecting herself against thinking about the fact her her brother has to die for her claim to winterfell. Even D&D said they didn't want her to be hated so they cut some scenes and I think that's bull, you can't expect views to love every character I think it had more to do with hate directed at her outside the show since she's young and idiots can't tell real life from TV. But what you gonna do, I personally wanted her to have her Lil moment of not kneeling I think they took away from her and Tyrion.
1970	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-06-02	I'm not sure the "just a kid" excuse is completely valid.  Children in Westeros are expected to grow up more quickly than in the RL. Remember Ned talking about Rickon needing to act older because "he's nearly four"?  They get responsibility sooner, they learn adult roles sooner, they fight and have children sooner, etc.. 
She's not yet an adult (that's 16 in Westeros), but I don't think "a kid" quite describes the expectations for someone her age.  Which actually includes being married.
1971	Newstar	2013-06-02	But the two scenes aren't even in the same galaxy in terms of how silly and naive they make Sansa look.In your opinion. I'd say they're about roughly the same in how they make Sansa look. Book Sansa had no notion the Tyrells were interested in her for her claim until someone else pointed it out to her, and even then she pretty much put it--and the implication that the Tyrells were hoping to claim Winterfell over her brother's dead body--out of her mind in favour of fantasies about puppies and barges and how Willas would love her when he saw her in her pretty dress until Cersei's revelation that she was to marry Tyrion snapped her out of it. Book Sansa thinking the Tyrells were interested in her hand in marriage for non-political reasons (until someone tells her otherwise) was about on par with TV Sansa innocently wondering if her family would be invited to the wedding, in my opinion, in terms of making Sansa look extremely silly and naive, caught up in romantic fantasies and ignorant of political realities.  Is a Sansa who hopes that her family might be permitted to attend a Highgarden wedding any different from a Sansa who has absolutely no notion that the Tyrells are only interested in marrying her for political reasons until someone tells her otherwise and who wonders "What would Willas want with Winterfell when he has Highgarden"? I don't think so. Different scenes, same Sansa.maybe her focusing on the pretty dress and imagining her life in highgarden is her way of protecting herself against thinking about the fact her her brother has to die for her claim to winterfellThat's just fanwanking or headcanon, though. There's nothing in the show to suggest that TV Sansa has any problem with a political marriage or with Loras and Tyrion's families counting on Robb dying to access her claim. She's thrilled at marrying Loras, after all. She objects to the marriage to Tyrion first and foremost because, as she tells Margaery in 3x07, Tyrion's a Lannister, but when Margaery mentions what her child from the marriage might be able to claim, Sansa's disgust is not at the Lannisters accessing the North, but at having to have sex with Tyrion to produce a child. It would have been very easy for the writers to include a line here or there to make it absolutely clear that Sansa was reluctant to be married off for her claim, as she was in the books (even if she was willing to marry Willas for other reasons). They did not.I personally think the overall show portrayal is very fair, perhaps leaning towards more favorable to Sansa.TV Sansa actually showed one instance of being smarter than her book self, under similar circumstances. Book Sansa told Dontos all about the plan to marry Willas (which is of course what tipped off Littlefinger), and then thinks that she'd told Dontos but "he didn't count" (ugh, Sansa, sometimes I swear to God...) When TV Sansa told Littlefinger that she wished to remain in KL, on the other hand, as opposed to going with him, she made up a reason why and refused to disclose the true reason (the marriage to Loras). Very, very smart. Of course, Littlefinger already knew the truth because Loras was a blabbermouth, and it's possible he chose to blow the whistle on the Loras match not only to satisfy Cersei but also out of spite that she had refused his offer of escape in favour of marriage to another guy, but that was impressive. You might also say that TV Sansa seems to understand and accept the idea that she'll have to enter into a political marriage (she has a non-reaction to Margaery talking about the political benefits of her marriage to Tyrion, except to get upset at the idea of having sex with Tyrion), whereas Book Sansa didn't seem to grasp that until it was pointed out to her, so that shows a level of maturity and understanding about the nature of marriage that Book Sansa doesn't have at this stage.In general, though, I think that the TV series doesn't dumb down Sansa; rather, it highlights how silly and naive Book Sansa is at this juncture. If TV Sansa doesn't grow a brain when we get into the post-Lysa Vale storyline and fails to make any deductions of her own while hanging on Littlefinger's every word, then fair enough, but I think she's just about where she needs to be in the show in terms of savvy.

1975	Newstar	2013-06-02	That "naive and immature" fantasy involved her being active in trying to escape much earlier than the book version, the result being that she's been rendered almost totally passive in the narrative.Well, the only reason she was trying to escape much earlier in the book version is that the opportunity was presented to her much earlier in ACOK. In the show, she only got her first offer of escape in 2x09--which she quite sensibly declined--and her first offer of escape from Littlefinger in 2x10. It's a time delay, nothing more. And remember that in 3x01, Sansa was the one who reminded Littlefinger of his previous promise to aid her. She wasn't just trotting off to the godswood on a mysterious note and following instructions; she's independently on her own initiative broaching a treasonous subject with Littlefinger, with her handmaiden and Littlefinger's assistant barely out of earshot. I suppose if she were being really "active," she would have sought out Littlefinger in the show without waiting for him to come to her, but if anything, it's even more active than in the books. Really, though, as I've said, if you took Book Sansa and put her in TV Sansa's circumstances, you'd probably get the same actions.

1976	nirolo	2013-06-05	It's amazing how eerily quite this entire forum got after the Red Wedding.
1977	CerseiLannister04	2013-08-12	I loved the wedding of Tyrion and Sansa honestly, because I had not the book before seeing this wedding. Now I know that she does not kneel for Tyrion that's the only thing that made me mad but other then that I really enjoyed that scene of the show.
1978	espec22	2013-05-19	My family couldn't believe that Sam was helpful for once and thgat Tyrion actually married Sansa.
My sister wanted to see the death of the Titan's bastard.
...................
1979	Young Nan	2013-05-20	My husband thinks Daario is a faceless man.
1980	A Winters Summer	2013-05-20	My brother thinks Rob will head to Kings Landing after the wedding. He also thought Daario was a cool guy and character, I was very dissapointed about that.
1981	Ahri Adaran	2013-05-20	Am happy that Daario seems to going over well mostly. I was afraid that people would dismiss him as Fabio helping Dany just because she's pretty so everything is too easy for Dany. A bit of that in the threads I've read but mostly positive.
1982	ohpooratlas	2013-05-20	My boyfriend is definitely predicting that Dario and Dany will hook up. 
He also thinks Arya will be reunited with Robb and Cat.
I was proud of my poker face.
He doesn't feel at all sorry for Sansa.  He feels sorry for Tyrion.
1983	TheGreenBell	2013-05-20	Most of them all thought Daario was hot, other than that, none. I'm starting to dislike the fact that some of my friends do not pay attention to the other character's storyline (Sam, Bran, Arya), they only pay attention to who's hot. Hopefully the next episode will make them pay attention.
1984	Christy_McKenna	2013-05-20	My friend thinks that Dany will be in Westeros by the end of this season and also, my favorite, that Shireen is part dragon.
1985	BendTheKnee610	2013-05-20	My parents seemed to find the Gendry/Mel scene to be gratuitous (at least until she tied him to the bed and took his blood).

Every non reader I know was completely confused what the point of the leeches were.

1987	waaimasjien	2013-05-20	My boyfriend found this episode extremely exciting. He was sure something extremely bad was going to happen during the Sansa/Tyrion wedding. He predicted Joff was going to drop dead, ironically.
He also thinks Daario and Dany will be together.
He absolutely loved the Queen of Thorns "grandfather/brother/father-in-law" and Cersei's "Nobody cares what your father said"
1988	Demandred	2013-05-20	My boyfriend is definitely predicting that Dario and Dany will hook up. My dad thought the same thing as soon as Daario made his intro in the beginning. I was actually a bit surprised, lol. He's also excited for Arya getting closer to her mother. That's going be hard to watch...
1989	Weirwoodwhisper	2013-05-20	Thoughts: They dislike Sansa because she was "cruel" to Tyrion, something I cannot see. They also think Stannis is a fanatic of R'hollor and that he will have Gendry killed. The "Battle in the snow" wasn't noticed by them.
Predictions: Joffrey will rape Sansa, Arya will be reunited with her family and for some reason Jaquen, Samwell and Gilly will be attacked by Others and saved by Ghost, Dany and Daario will become lovers, there will be a lot of scenes with Robb and Cat but they don't think they will die anytime soon.
1990	JackinAcar	2013-05-20	Friend thought Dany will do Naharis and that Joff would follow through on his threat to Sansa.
He was pissed at Sansa when she didn't kneel. He also thinks that Shae still loves Tyrion.

Such is the result of what they have made Tyrion on the show. Combined with people who don't read generally wanting uncomplicated fluff where the good guy prevails and true love conquers all etc etc.My friend has no predictions. I was satisfied seeing her surprise that the wedding actually happened.
1994	Dru	2013-05-20	Wife loved Daario, felt bad for Tyrion, still wants Joffrey and Cersie dead,  loved the Sam scene and wanted more Arya/The Hound. She is also pissed that we have to wait 2 weeks for the next episode.
Also add Shae to who she wants dead.

2000	YTDN	2013-05-20	I just realized this. Why would they do such a vile thing? Frak me /eek.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':eek:' />It's because this sunday is Memorial Day, and last year they had a huge drop in ratings for that episode (even though it was Blackwater). There's also the problem of spoilers- if a lot of people don't see the RW on the first showing, the surprise will be lost, which is a shame considering how much they're trying to hide it.
2001	Penguin king	2013-05-20	Every time I see that a non-reader thought Sansa was cruel and that they felt sorry for Tyrion a little part of me dies inside.I'm a book reader, and while I don't blame Sansa, I do feel bad for Tyrion. He really shouldn't have expected much more than cold courtesy from her but that doesn't make his sense of rejection any less painful. Even Sansa admits to feeling pity for him.

Every episode he says that. Without fail.
2003	Arkash	2013-05-20	I was glad they reminded us Sansa is 14 in the show ! I hope it will make people understand her position ! A part of everyone of us dies when an Unsuillied talks trash on Sansa !
2004	mrs_serpounce	2013-05-20	Nonsense, its not because of the show. Many bookreaders have been hating Sansa over the wedding incidents for years.This. So much this. While they've made Tyrion more on the "good" side of neutral for the show, as a book reader, I do not understand why other book readers see Tyrion's treatment of Sansa post-wedding - including not taking advantage of his "rights as a husband" (note I put that in quotes) and instead caring a few whits about what Sansa feels and thinks - as anything other than what it is: him actually showing a conscience. Because if he didn't have a conscience he would've consummated the marriage right away... like so many other arranged marriages did back in medieval times. It's one of the things that endeared me to his character.I don't get the outright ire at Tyrion's "whitewashing." Maybe it's because, while he's pretty damn selfish and ruthless in the novel, he has quite a few more pricks of conscience than a whole lot of other characters (who have less of a comeuppance) do.
2005	Queen Elsa	2013-05-20	About Mel and Gendry: My friend says Mel doesn't show the "lamb" the knife, only her beebs. Also, Gendry thinks he gonna gets some, but the leeches got some instead.
"Joffrey and Draco Malfoy will get along if they meet."
"The WW looks a little bit like Tywin."

A part of everyone of us dies when an Unsuillied talks trash on Sansa !I know she is only 14 in the books but I was hoping they would age her a little and say she was 15 or 16 now. No one knows how much time has passed between seasons, and she was 13 in Season 1, it would be perfectly acceptable to have her 15 or 16 now, she does not look 14 that's for sure. Arya and Bran don't look 10 and 11 either, I would believe 12 and 13.
2007	Mother of Mini Dragons	2013-05-20	My hubby's only comments were that he feel terrible for Sansa and that the poor girl can't catch a break and horrible things continuing to happen to her. He was also really upset at Joffrey's comments and really wanted Sansa to rat him out to Tyrion. I had to calm him about this one because he was certain Joffrey was going to rape her.
His other comments were about Sam and that he can't do anything and even when he killed the white walker, he was yelling b/c he left behind the knife.
My hubby also thinks the actress playing Mel is not sexy at all and that she need to stop trying b/c it ain't workin. He just got quiet during Dany's scenes and didn't utter a peep though. /dry.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt='<_<' />

2008	Mother of Mini Dragons	2013-05-20	I know she is only 14 in the books but I was hoping they would age her a little and say she was 15 or 16 now. No one knows how much time has passed between seasons, and she was 13 in Season 1, it would be perfectly acceptable to have her 15 or 16 now, she does not look 14 that's for sure. Arya and Bran don't look 10 and 11 either, I would believe 12 and 13.I just spent Friday at my daughter's field day and was shocked at what 5th graders look like now and they are about 10-11ish. So I think these actors can pass the ages they are claiming. I saw many 5th graders that are as tall and taller than me.
2009	Arkash	2013-05-20	Reading the episode threads at TwoP is gold ! Quite all the posters there are Unsullied !
And I shall watch the episode with my Unsullied friends tonight, so I'll come back here afterwards.
2010	Kaitscralt	2013-05-20	My hubby's only comments were that he feel terrible for Sansa and that the poor girl can't catch a break and horrible things continuing to happen to her. He was also really upset at Joffrey's comments and really wanted Sansa to rat him out to Tyrion. I had to calm him about this one because he was certain Joffrey was going to rape her.His other comments were about Sam and that he can't do anything and even when he killed the white walker, he was yelling b/c he left behind the knife.My hubby also thinks the actress playing Mel is not sexy at all and that she need to stop trying b/c it ain't workin. He just got quiet during Dany's scenes and didn't utter a peep though. /dry.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt='<_<' />I haven't had a full convo with my Dad yet, but he thinks Arya and the Hound will be friends now. lolI disagree with your husband about Carice, that's for sure... lucky Gendry.
2011	Bastard Walder	2013-05-20	I haven't had a full convo with my Dad yet, but he thinks Arya and the Hound will be friends now. lolWell they kind of are, in a horrible, awful, way.
2012	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-20	Every time I see that a non-reader thought Sansa was cruel and that they felt sorry for Tyrion a little part of me dies inside.Me too...it kind of makes me partly angry, partly sad and partly sick.
2013	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-20	Nonsense, its not because of the show. Many bookreaders have been hating Sansa over the wedding incidents for years.Hating a girl who has been forced to marry a man who is a family member of those that destroyed her family? Are you kidding me? Then the people hating her are fools.
2014	Young Nan	2013-05-20	My friend thinks that Dany will be in Westeros by the end of this season and also, my favorite, that Shireen is part dragon.LOL!  My husband was like "whats up with the lizard girl".  I had to explain about Greyscale.
2015	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-20	LOL!  My husband was like "whats up with the lizard girl".  I had to explain about Greyscale.LIZARD GIRL. Haha, awww; poor little Shireen.
2016	Jonsblock	2013-05-20	Every time I see that a non-reader thought Sansa was cruel and that they felt sorry for Tyrion a little part of me dies inside.I hear ya. It's not like he's a member of the family that has kidnapped her, paralyzed her brother, killed her father and has had her beaten and nearly raped. But he's the nice Lannister.
2017	bobbybuilderton	2013-05-20	Does anyone think their unsullied pals will blame Stannis/Mel for Robb? Mel talks about not seeing the blade and Stannis burned the leech...IDK man
2018	Queen Elsa	2013-05-20	I forgot to mention: "Dany and Daario - Love at first sight?"
2019	Kaitscralt	2013-05-20	My lady friend at work thought the episode sucked because Jaime wasn't in it... she must not remember that a few episodes ago she vowed that there was no redemption for Jaime and she wouldn't forgive him.
2020	Colonel Green	2013-05-20	No one knows how much time has passed between seasonsActually, we have pretty good measures for the passage of time between both seasons.  In season 2, Arya and Tyrion's plots both pick up at most a few days after season 1 ended; in season 3, Sam and to a lesser extent Davos both follow pretty hard on where season 2 ended.If you try to figure out how years could have passed in this world by looking closely at the timing of events, you'll go mad pretty quickly.
2021	Kasrith	2013-05-20	Shireen is part dragon.I really like that one. It's such an easy assumption to jump to since she lives on Dragonstone and everything too /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
2022	gibbles545	2013-05-20	My housemate posted this on my Facebook wall after watching the episode,'This is the most fucked up, dysfunctional wedding I've ever seen. Eastenders couldnt make this shit up!'.
Oh sweet summer child...
2023	SeventySeven	2013-05-20	My housemate posted this on my Facebook wall after watching the episode,'This is the most fucked up, dysfunctional wedding I've ever seen. Eastenders couldnt make this shit up!'.Oh sweet summer child...I beg to differ. I think Eastenders might have done worse /laugh.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':laugh:' />
2024	vectner	2013-05-20	If you try to figure out how years could have passed in this world by looking closely at the timing of events, you'll go mad pretty quickly.That was actually my point, from a TV viewers standpoint, one season eaquals 1 year. In the books its even more complicated, but after 5 books it's only been three and half years, they kids are growing super fast, even now there is no way Arya could be mistaken for a boy.
2025	Kasrith	2013-05-20	He's also excited for Arya getting closer to her mother. That's going be hard to watch..."If you think this is going to have a happy ending...."
2026	Kasrith	2013-05-20	Also, most bookreaders still think in terms of black/white as well.  As in Jaime is a "good" guy.Many people confuse liking a character with labeling said character as good (or bad perhaps) which eliminates the grey areas of ASOIAF.
2027	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-20	I beg to differ. I think Eastenders might have done worse /laugh.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':laugh:' />LOL.
2028	bobbybuilderton	2013-05-20	This isn't a reaction, but i's a bit weird that some unsullied refuse to see Tyrion in a bad light in any way. I understand Joffrey is a little shit but he's also Tyrion's nephew. A threat (that was clearly sincere) to cut off his junk is pretty dark if you think about it. Yet because we hate Joffrey people kind of miss it. Not that Joffrey doesn't deserve it but the threat and the fact that he was serious and that Joffrey is still his family (viewers hate Stannis for what happened to Renly) should indicate Tyrion is not an angel and is at least capable of some dark shit. Not to mention that he directly caused several people to burn to death and drown.
Just an amusing observation.
2029	Where Boars Glow	2013-05-20	I disagree with your husband about Carice, that's for sure... lucky Gendry.yes she is dropdead gorgeous ?
2030	Nezzer	2013-05-20	I really, really love how the Unsullied watchers, not only at TWOP, but also at NeoGAF and WiC, and even professional Unsullied reviewers are all calling Tyrion and Sansa's wedding "the worst wedding ever". They have no idea /lmao.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lmao:' />
2031	mrs_serpounce	2013-05-20	I understand Joffrey is a little shit but he's also Tyrion's nephew. A threat (that was clearly sincere) to cut off his junk is pretty dark if you think about it.

Not to mention that he directly caused several people to burn to death and drown.Just an amusing observation.Great point. Hey Tyrion "whitewashing" peeps, take notice.
2032	protar	2013-05-20	Unrelated to this episode really but my mum on Theon tonight:
"Is that guy being tortured at Baratheon?"
Wut.
2033	Plume	2013-05-20	So I watched the two latest episodes with my BF. He thinks that the one torturing Theon is the bastard of Lord Bolton. He also thinks that poor lord Bolton doesn't know this. He hopes Robb won't be as just as Stannis and punish lord Bolton for the torture of Theon...
He loves the hound and Davos /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' /> He pitied Tyrion so much during the wedding and didn't care about Sansa until she reminds us that she's 14.
He also thinks that Ygritte's going to die for some reason. Said Sam was such an idiot for leaving the obsidian knife behind and he thought the ravens were evil.
He predicts that Cersei will kill Margaery, that Rickon will die because he's useless and for the sake of the quota of shit happening to the Starks.
He also thinks that Daario is going to be a turncloack for sure given how easy it was for him to give his alliegeance to Dany.
2034	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-05-20	I'd like to see how most people would react after killing an undead Zombie thing in the middle of the night in a forest away from civilization surrounded by the sound of ten thousand creepy ravens quorking relentlessly with no idea what or who else could be out there. Far too many people commenting that Sam is some kind of moron where basically the average person would shit their pants and die, not necessarily in that order.

2036	firepoet	2013-05-20	Does anyone think their unsullied pals will blame Stannis/Mel for Robb? Mel talks about not seeing the blade and Stannis burned the leech...IDK manProbably, but that's ok because a lot of book readers think that too.
2037	bobbybuilderton	2013-05-20	Probably, but that's ok because a lot of book readers think that too.Really? But the plans for the RW were in motion before they burned the leeches. Or so I thought. So it seems weird to me to blame them for that. Ah well. We must make sure that this is one of the FIRST threads opened for next episode hahaha. RECORD YOUR FRIENDS REACTIONS if you can
2038	Vovea	2013-05-20	My friends think that Daario is a faceless man and the other captains were too and their not really dead they just took their faces (heads?) off to infiltrate Dany's gang... It's my own fault for trying to explain to them how a faceless man can change appearances. 
Most of them feel more sorry for Sansa during her wedding which is awesome, though it took them a while to remember the King's Landing riot and the Hound saving Sansa from rape. They were saying that they thought the Hound was lying to get Arya's trust and to betray her... somehow? I think my group of particular friends just really the idea of some getting betrayed, yet funnily enough they didn't mention Shae at all.
2039	hollowcrown	2013-05-20	My girlfriend was cute.
"Tyrion shouldn't marry Sansa because he loves Shae, and Sansa shouldn't have to marry Tyrion. Same with the Queen and the gay Knight. No one should have to marry anyone they don't want to!!"
She's a cutie. Also she was pissed off Sam didn't pick up the dagger, and she thinks Arya is safe and something finally has gone right for her!

But he's the nice Lannister.In fairness to Tyrion, she's a member of the family that blamed him for a crime he didn't commit,  kidnapped him,  and shoved him in the moon cells.

After seeing it kill the monster in the woods, any normal person would have picked it up and treated it like their most valued possession.
2049	shiola	2013-05-20	My friend thinks Daario is so hot and went on, at length, very obnoxiously, about it.
My brother thought that maybe the Tyrion/Sansa wedding would be the RW...  He thought Tyrion might stab Joffrey.  The whole scene made him uncomfortable and he thought something bad was going to happen.  But he's been convinced since episode probably 2 of the season that the RW has to be the Royal Wedding and it will be in episode 9.  So he's like, "I can't believe I have to wait to weeks to see Joffrey die."  He said, "Make sure you post on that board saying that I called this shit.  The Red Wedding is next and Joffrey will die and maybe Margaery.  Probably Loras."
Sweet summer child.

He was like, "I'm sad for Tyrion, of course, but I feel more bad for Sansa.  This is what she thought would be the most beautiful day of her life because she loves those stories...  and she's marrying him, and Joffrey's there, and her family is dead, and SHE'S ONLY FUCKING 14????!!!  This is horrible.  I can't believe you're telling me people hate her."
2056	shiola	2013-05-20	Update:  Just got a text from my brother:
"I've been thinking about Dany's bathtub scene...  Why doesn't she have a dragon with her at ALL fucking times to ensure that shit doesn't happen?  I mean Daario could have been a legit assassin.  COME ON, Dany."
2057	Queen Elsa	2013-05-20	I'm getting a lot of reactions why in seven hells Sam left that damn dragonglass on the snow. There could be more "older gentlemen" out there yah know.
2058	A Man Is A Man	2013-05-21	My friend:
1) hates that Sam didn't pick up the dagger
2) "expected more drama" from the wedding, like someone dying or something (heh! Just wait)
3) She loves "the Dragon Lady" and Jon Snow and wants them to hook up. I told her that hasn't happened in the books yet but who knows?
2059	JonCon's Red Beard	2013-05-21	I love how people call Tyrion/sansa's wedding the WORST WEDDING ever.
They'll see the RW and say, "no, this is the worst wedding ever!"
Then, they'll say the same about Joffrey's wedding. And then, once more for Ramsay/fArya's.
2060	Christy_McKenna	2013-05-21	LOL!  My husband was like "whats up with the lizard girl".  I had to explain about Greyscale.I know! I explained greyscale to her but she didn't really believe me. She probably thinks I am trying to keep a spoiler from her /laugh.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':laugh:' />I really like that one. It's such an easy assumption to jump to since she lives on Dragonstone and everything too /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />Another reason why she thinks she is right! She thinks shireen is locked up because she might randomly turn into a dragon /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
2061	Pinkie Baelish	2013-05-21	Funny story: At uni today, I asked my friend whether he'd seen the new episode, and the girl next to me asks "I didn't watch it, but was the Red Wedding in last night's episode?" I give her the biggest glare(since my friend hasn't read the books) and tell my friend that the Red Wedding is Sansa's wedding because she was on her period at the time /lol.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lol:' /> Obviously he didn't buy it, as I wasn't trying to be serious either, but let's hope he doesn't put two and two together.
2062	Mendoza	2013-05-21	My poor brother is losing track of things. He thought The Hound was wasting his time going to the Twins, as that alliance ended when Robb married the nurse. I had to explain to him that Robb's uncle is taking his place. Yikes.
2063	jotabe1789	2013-05-21	I need to get some unsullieds for myself. It's way too much fun /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />
2064	Runaway Penguin	2013-05-21	My friend thinks that after the Cersei-Marge dialogue and its ending, it will definitely play out the other way around.
He also thinks Cersei will try to kill Tywin for forcing her into marriage.
He correctly assumes Hound hates everyone but has a soft spot for Stark girls.
He thinks Tyrion will have to keep his watch for a looong time.
And is confused int he difference between wights and White Walkers.
EDIT: And hates Sam for not picking up the spearhead, but then he recalled Sam found more so maybe he still has some Dragonglass with him.

2066	Woel	2013-05-21	Most of them all thought Daario was hot, other than that, none. I'm starting to dislike the fact that some of my friends do not pay attention to the other character's storyline (Sam, Bran, Arya), they only pay attention to who's hot. Hopefully the next episode will make them pay attention.LOL. Seems like your friends should start reconsidering how they view the show...
2067	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2013-05-21	sister was creeped out by the ending, she doesn't really watch the show but when the WW showed up she was like "whoa" and the weirwood tree creeped her out when they showed it before sam and gilly got in the hut.
2068	The Mondrian Oak	2013-05-21	And is confused int he difference between wights and White Walkers.This is a common problem, though I don't understand why. The show has made very clear that the two are different entities, ever since season 1. Is it that "Wight" sounds like "White"?
2069	PatrickStormborn	2013-05-21	My sister thinks this season is the "worst one yet" because "nothing's happened". And... she's right. Everything is building up to the next two episodes and next season. Robb's story must look very strange to her, considering that he hasn't done anything of note all season. The same is true with other characters though: nothing happened in King's Landing until this episode, Stannis has only just started doing things, Theon hasn't done anything since episode 4, Bran hasn't done anything since episode 2, Jon hasn't done anything since episode 6, and Catelyn has had hardly any screentime whatsoever. I can't help but think that spreading ASoS over two seasons was a huge mistake. Personally I would have had the RW in episode 7, PW in episode 9 and Jaime's return to KL in episode 10, but it's too late for that I guess.
She seemed to enjoy this episode though, because there weren't any Robb, Jon or Theon scenes.

Funny, my friends seems to like it even though that much happens in every episode.
2071	i-sawr-the-ghost-of-harren	2013-05-21	My sister was worried about Joffrey's threat of rape to Sansa. She was waiting for him to barge in the couple's chambers with his Kingsguards after Tyrion collapsed on the couch thing.
She also thought Daario was still planning on killing Dany even after he swore the oath. She was waiting for him to swing that arakh up and injure her.
She was also quite distraught (as well as I was) when we realized Sam actually left the obsidian with Puddles. We were both waiting for him to turn back and grab it, but no, that didn't happen.
Edit: my sister also got weirded out by the weirwood tree (I had to remind her what it was coz she was anxious it might speak, LOL) and got quite confused why there were so many crows/ravens in its branches later on.

I mean,real stuff happens in jaime/Brienne's story: He gest his sword hand chopped off, evolves as a human being and saves her from a bear!Arya's story: the fight between the Hound and Beric, Dondarrion coming back from death, Melisandre kidnapping GendrySam's story: the Night's watch mutiny on Craster's Keep, Craster and Commander Mormont Killed.Dany's story: saved from a mantichore by ser Barristan, Drogon burning the Masters and the Unsullied sacking Astapor, a battle in Yunkai coming...I think you and your sister saying "nothing happens" is an exaggeration. Yes, I deliberately left out the storylines where the plot was advanced, because I was listing the storylines where nothing had happened... And yes, "nothing's happened" was certainly an exaggeration, but generally there has been far less plot advancement than in the past two seasons. Dany, Arya and Jaime's scenes have been praised by me, and my sister seems to have found these scenes the best. Sam's scene in the last episode was good, but overall his story has been handled terribly this year.But the problem with Dany/Arya/Jaime's scenes is that they're all disconnected from the main plot: the war. Nothing is happening on that front, which is why the season feels so slow and uneventful, and just feels like a build-up to next season.
2075	Joyful Union	2013-05-21	My sister thinks this season is the "worst one yet" because "nothing's happened". And... she's right. Everything is building up to the next two episodes and next season. Robb's story must look very strange to her, considering that he hasn't done anything of note all season. The same is true with other characters though: nothing happened in King's Landing until this episode, Stannis has only just started doing things, Theon hasn't done anything since episode 4, Bran hasn't done anything since episode 2, Jon hasn't done anything since episode 6, and Catelyn has had hardly any screentime whatsoever. I can't help but think that spreading ASoS over two seasons was a huge mistake. Personally I would have had the RW in episode 7, PW in episode 9 and Jaime's return to KL in episode 10, but it's too late for that I guess.She seemed to enjoy this episode though, because there weren't any Robb, Jon or Theon scenes.This just seems like a thinly veiled excuse to express your frustration with the show. Odd how your "sister" has the exact same complaints as you!

2082	Versiroth	2013-05-21	This. So much this. While they've made Tyrion more on the "good" side of neutral for the show, as a book reader, I do not understand why other book readers see Tyrion's treatment of Sansa post-wedding - including not taking advantage of his "rights as a husband" (note I put that in quotes) and instead caring a few whits about what Sansa feels and thinks - as anything other than what it is: him actually showing a conscience. Because if he didn't have a conscience he would've consummated the marriage right away... like so many other arranged marriages did back in medieval times. It's one of the things that endeared me to his character.I don't get the outright ire at Tyrion's "whitewashing." Maybe it's because, while he's pretty damn selfish and ruthless in the novel, he has quite a few more pricks of conscience than a whole lot of other characters (who have less of a comeuppance) do.I've read all five books, twice, and I never saw Tyrion as Selfish and ruthless.   I saw him as a guy who generally wants to do the right thing and had a strong sense of family (until he was wrongly accused of Joffreys death).	He has a very strong sense of self preservation, as anyone would.  Some times that might lead him to plot against someone he sees as an enemy, but I always saw him as a goodish gray character from start to finish.

2093	Rohanne	2013-05-21	- They liked Arya and the Hound. "He seems nicer to the Stark girls, don't you think?" 
- Some liked the Mel and Gendry scene, others didn't. All think she is evil and believe she has more power than other gods. 
- None of them have liked Sansa and in a way felt bad for Tyrion in their marriage deal. I was surprised how most people thought she was very mature (they were expecting her to be crying) in this episode and if anyone had cause to get drunk it was her, not Tyrion. Interesting discussion about whether people thought he stopped Joffrey from the bedding for his own sake (him being embarrassed about being naked in front of everyone) or for Sansa's. Even though she doesn't look her age, everyone felt more sympathetic for her once she said her age (that and remembering that Joffrey posed a threat to her, they were nervous he was going to follow through since Tyrion passed out).
- Of course, as most other's have said, everyone was annoyed that Sam didn't grab the dragonglass. 
- Most really liked this episode and are excited for the next wedding. /frown5.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':frown5:' />
- They seem to think something might happen to Robb, like he will lose the war. I don't think anyone believes he will die, at least not right now. That will be quite shocking, especially since Catelyn shares the same fate.

2096	Maizel	2013-05-21	My cousin isn't a book reader but a week ago he predicted Arya to meet up with her Mother and brother.
Than he watched some fanfest stream for a MMO called Eve,  where some corporation (guild) named their bases for event and characters in the book.
So the RW got spoiled for my cousin, and for alot of other as well, probably.
I would have slapped those people so hard.

2098	Lord_Baelish	2013-05-21	My colleague enjoyed the episode a lot, particularly the Sam an Dany scenes.
But when I mentioned that the preview for the next ep showed it would be focusing on Jon and Robb, she wasn't happy. She says Robb's story is the most boring in the show (and so far, she's right). Boy, is she in for a surprise next time.
I haven't talked to my boss about this ep yet, but she is convinced that Theon is being tortured by Lannisters.

2108	aedalia	2013-05-21	My coworker is very happy that the Hound is taking Arya back to her family... cue mother of all poker faces.
He thoguht Joff is a horrible little prick but that the wedding scene was funny when he took away the stool.
He also thought "Dany's right hand man" (Mormont) will be very jealous that Daario has shown up since Mormont is clearly in love with Dany and Dany is clearly going to get it on with Daario.
Overall, he liked the episode, even though there was a lack of Robb... cue father of all poker faces. I said, "Well, the wedding took up so much time, they'd have to cut out someone this episode."
2109	Rohanne	2013-05-21	Forgot to mention someone said, "Well, sucks Sansa doesn't get to be with Robb and his mom but at least Arya will.

"Uh, you know I don't really know their timeline of events, so I guess we'll see..." (Poor response, I know, but they NEVER ask me anything about what happens in the books, of course they do for this. I was a little flustered. Also, not a good liar, my cheeks get bright red when I do.)
2110	Ser Milady Wolf	2013-05-21	My colorful unsullied friend:
"Just when I thought we'd never see Danerys naked again, boomb there it all is. What a glorious day. And the red head too? It's like they're apologizing for all the blatant man ass. I do like how the fat loser finally has some purpose on the show now that he's killing the zombies.  Though I don't know how you can have him in the world and not have him be the first to die. I did think that new mercenary dumping out those dude's heads was rad too. If not fairly obvious. I did look the guy up and this is basically his first real acting job. Hell of a way to start. haha oh god. I about fell out of my chair watching Joffrey be a &%^*. You could see how much fun that actor was having."
2111	Zizou	2013-05-21	It's because this sunday is Memorial Day, and last year they had a huge drop in ratings for that episode (even though it was Blackwater). There's also the problem of spoilers- if a lot of people don't see the RW on the first showing, the surprise will be lost, which is a shame considering how much they're trying to hide it.Well, that explains it! Cheers
2112	Mikado	2013-05-21	Sadly there are no Unsullied I could watch the show with. I imagine it would be funny to see their reactions. Sadly none of my friends have Sky Atlantic included in their TV so they won't watch the series until... spring 2014.
At least my father asks me each week if Joff is finally dead.
2113	Kasrith	2013-05-21	I give her the biggest glare(since my friend hasn't read the books) and tell my friend that the Red Wedding is Sansa's wedding because she was on her period at the time /lol.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lol:' />Or simply cause she's marrying into the crimson Lannister clan?

My sister really, really doesn't care about neiter Robb or Jon. She does understand Jon is important because he's in the north and zombies are coming, but doesn't care about the character himself. And she think Robb is a waste of time, those minutes should be better used with Dany or Arya. She also think Sansa is an idiot (and she was really surprised when I told her she was one of my favorites). Appart from Arya the show didn't handle the Stark's storylines very well, and even then, she's not s good as book Arya IMOETA: chating with someone in FB who read the books, actually told me "I can't wait for the RW, no more Robb/Talisa and their time will be given to Roose Bolton". Is hard to admit it, but I agree, I will glady take more Roose and less TVRobb and Talisa

2126	kevin1989	2013-05-21	My sister thinks this season is the "worst one yet" because "nothing's happened". And... she's right. Everything is building up to the next two episodes and next season. Robb's story must look very strange to her, considering that he hasn't done anything of note all season. The same is true with other characters though: nothing happened in King's Landing until this episode, Stannis has only just started doing things, Theon hasn't done anything since episode 4, Bran hasn't done anything since episode 2, Jon hasn't done anything since episode 6, and Catelyn has had hardly any screentime whatsoever. I can't help but think that spreading ASoS over two seasons was a huge mistake. Personally I would have had the RW in episode 7, PW in episode 9 and Jaime's return to KL in episode 10, but it's too late for that I guess.She seemed to enjoy this episode though, because there weren't any Robb, Jon or Theon scenes.Strange my friends like this season the most, because much more interesting things happen this season and it isn't scene-after-scene like season 2. It's not about what happen, it's about how it happen. This season handle things much better than the last 2 seasons (at least with season 2 because that was scene after scene and after every episode it was, nothing happen per character at all only one scene). This season takes it time, therefore scenes like the bear-pit-scene stays with us. Season 2 was more mainstream than season 1 and 3, because of the pacing.
2127	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-21	I think so too. My sister really, really doesn't care about neiter Robb or Jon. She does understand Jon is important because he's in the north and zombies are coming, but doesn't care about the character himself. And she think Robb is a waste of time, those minutes should be better used with Dany or Arya. She also think Sansa is an idiot (and she was really surprised when I told her she was one of my favorites). Appart from Arya the show didn't handle the Stark's storylines very well, and even then, she's not s good as book Arya IMOETA: chating with someone in FB who read the books, actually told me "I can't wait for the RW, no more Robb/Talisa and their time will be given to Roose Bolton". Is hard to admit it, but I agree, I will glady take more Roose and less TVRobb and Talisalol I love Roose Bolton. But yeh, it's sad that the tragedy will be lost on a lot of people. /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />

Self-preservation or not, my only point is that it indicates there is some capacity for darkness there. I just don't consider killing someone in self defense, by whatever means dark.
2129	RottenAppleFossoway	2013-05-21	My friends mom is just sooooo happy that Arya is headed to the Twins to finally get back to her mother and brother.
Bum bum ba bum whaaaaaaaaa

Self-preservation or not, my only point is that it indicates there is some capacity for darkness there.I agree.Even if doing it to save himself and the city, the method of death is a horrid one. Necessary for his purposes? Yes. But don't tell me someone that actively thinks about unleashing wildfire on an army so they burn to death or drown doesn't have a capability for dark thought.

But don't tell me someone that actively thinks about unleashing wildfire on an army so they burn to death or drown doesn't have a capability for dark thought. I'm not saying that Tyrion does not have the capacity for a dark thought, everyone does, I just don't think killing anyone in self defense is dark.
2132	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-21	I'm not saying that Tyrion does not have the capacity for a dark thought, everyone does, I just don't think killing anyone in self defense is dark.Murder and death is always dark, it is a sad and horrible thing. There is nothing 'light' about death. All war is 'dark' whereas, the soldiers just doing as they are told are just that, they are fighting in a war because they have to. It is those devising the battles that at least must have some darkness to them knowing, even in war, their strategies are simply to kill as much of their enemies as they can. There's nothing 'nice' about that. It's not evil it's just war, but it's not a nice business.im probs not making much sense now, it's early morning and im tired, lol
2133	bobbybuilderton	2013-05-21	I'm not saying that Tyrion does not have the capacity for a dark thought, everyone does, I just don't think killing anyone in self defense is dark.My argument isn't what he did is dark. The argument is that willingness to go through with it, regardless of if it was justified, should be a clue in to non-readers that his heart is not as pure as they think. There are things that people would not do, even if their life was in danger. If someone comes at you with a knife and you have one too, you would stab them and be justified. But because not everyone would be able to bring themselves to do it, it is an indicator of the type of person you are deep down.

2134	bobbybuilderton	2013-05-21	I suppose in a way it boils down to if you think people are inherently good, inherently evil, or blank slates. I am in the inherently evil camp and that we have to be taught to restrain/cover up the aggression and selfishness in us. So I see the willingness to put people through death by fire and drowning when the chips are down to be a sort of gauge of how capable a person is of atrocities. How bad do things have to get before you start showing that ultimately selfish nature? And when things do get that bad, how far are you willing to go? In my previous example, maybe everyone would be able to stab the mugger, but how many people would stab the mugger and twist to make sure he stays down and doesn't come after them?
Everyone will show the self-preserving nature when it gets to the point that King's Landing was, but not everyone will be willing to go to the length of burning people alive/drowning them in the pursuit of that self-preservation. And because Tyrion would, it should (in my opinion) indicate that he's not so squeaky clean as I've seen many Unsullied believe. Because I have seen people believe he is good to the core and a saint who would never hurt a fly and sits in his chambers looking out the window sighing longingly.
2135	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-21	Whilst I don't agree humans are inherently evil from birth, I agree it takes a certain sort of person that would think of the wildfire and let alone actually use it. You're right in saying it should show people he's not exactly 'squeaky clean' as you say.

2137	Oakenfist	2013-05-21	You guys who are saying the show is missing the mark with certain characters are talking to the wrong show watchers.
It seems most of you hang out with folks who need to be spoon fed details and can't figure out main character names by season 3. That isn't the shows fault.
2138	greywindsrage	2013-05-21	My friend doesn't trust Daario. He feels that Dany is going to stay in Yunkai before she goes to Westeros.
2139	Bastard Walder	2013-05-21	When your friends who have been watching the show since the beginning don't know who Davos is, don't blame D&D. Blame your friends' mothers for smoking during the pregnancy, because there is no way someone can be that dumb otherwise.
2140	greywindsrage	2013-05-22	My sister thinks this season is the "worst one yet" because "nothing's happened". And... she's right. Everything is building up to the next two episodes and next season. Robb's story must look very strange to her, considering that he hasn't done anything of note all season. The same is true with other characters though: nothing happened in King's Landing until this episode, Stannis has only just started doing things, Theon hasn't done anything since episode 4, Bran hasn't done anything since episode 2, Jon hasn't done anything since episode 6, and Catelyn has had hardly any screentime whatsoever. I can't help but think that spreading ASoS over two seasons was a huge mistake. Personally I would have had the RW in episode 7, PW in episode 9 and Jaime's return to KL in episode 10, but it's too late for that I guess.She seemed to enjoy this episode though, because there weren't any Robb, Jon or Theon scenes.They had to spread ASOS into two seasons because they can't have one whole season of AFFC. The Red Viper vs The Mountain will be next season(a big treat for non-readers). Tyrion escaping, Sansa's rescue and The Willdings raid will all be next season. Non - readers are not going to enjoy 1 whole season of AFFC alone. The producers are definitely going to merge AFFC and ADWD.

This... isn't really responding to my post.I said that ASoS should not have been spread over 20 episodes because there simply isn't enough material. I made no mention of AFfC. However, I do think that season 4 should have been the last bits of ASoS (Jon at the Wall, Tyrion's trial and escape, Sansa in the Vale) and the first half of AFfC/ADwD.

However, I do think that season 4 should have been the last bits of ASoS (Jon at the Wall, Tyrion's trial and escape, Sansa in the Vale) and the first half of AFfC/ADwD.Nothing has happened? We had at least the Dracarys scene, Jaime being maimed, LC Mormont being killed, the climb of the wall, the bear fight, and the GW. We are still 2 episodes away from the final and we know that there will be at least three big moments for Jon, Daenerys, and Robb. These events, alone, are equivalent to what happened in season 2. We have plenty of new characters that forced them to dedicate two episodes presenting them. For the next season, we will need a few more. So no, I do not agree with you.

This season has included some of the best scenes of the series. But some episodes have featured a heavy amount of filler scenes (episodes 6 and 7 particularly). And there's certainly not enough material for next season. In King's Landing and at the Wall perhaps, but nowhere else.

Nothing else major would be left in ASOS at the end of this season. I don't see them stretching the last quarter of ASOS over a whole season.
2146	PatrickStormborn	2013-05-22	Isn't this what's going to happen anyway? Nothing else major would be left in ASOS at the end of this season. I don't see them stretching the last quarter of ASOS over a whole season. That's what I thought, but in interviews they keep repeating that it's "one book over two seasons". Bran's ADwD material will certainly be pushed forward. I thought Dany's would be too, but she can't leave Slaver's Bay until all the other characters have arrived.
2147	The Pain Yak	2013-05-22	That's rich, it's not like those people were just minding their own business, they were violently assaulting the city, would have put Tyrion's head on a spike, and raped and killed thousands for sport.Keep in mind, though, that he does this to his own men as well. The show kept it simple by having a single empty ship, but Book Tyrion sends his own men out as bait for Stannis's fleet, who knows how many of whom burn and drown and die because of it.
2148	King Zee	2013-05-22	Isn't this what's going to happen anyway? Nothing else major would be left in ASOS at the end of this season. I don't see them stretching the last quarter of ASOS over a whole season.for certain characters they can.example the remaining Kings Landing arc from ASOS can comfortably stretch over the entire seasonthe Wall is trickier but they will have to stretch so that Stannis arrives a the end of Season 4.the Meeren conquest flashbacks from ADWD  get put into Season 4.the Greyjoy Kingsmoot from AFFC gets into season 4and I believe that Reek  at Moat Cailen will be in season 4.

2149	shiola	2013-05-22	Text from Unsullied Brother.  Expands on some of my previous posts and has some new details.
" GoT thoughts...
- next ep is so the red wedding and it's so joffrey's/margaery's.  I don't think Margaery would die BUT it would make sense with the song story last week and that line about being the most popular dead person in town.  I'll say joffrey dies, and granny tyrell.  i don't know how tho, maybe a big-ass mob that pretends to love the queen?  i'll say that.  i think that's been foreshadowed.
- if i don't find out in the next two episodes who has theon and why, i will rage.
- how the fuck is robb's war going?  we kind of didn't hear about that.
- maybe the red wedding will be the one with the frey's daughter and robb would die.  only because you hinted at robb dying when you said that if talisa is pregnant, bad things will probably happen. otherwise i wouldn't think it.  and i still don't think it's this one because joff's wedding has been set up better AND  because you said the rw is a game changer and if robb dies it's not a game changer, it's a lannisters-don't-have-as-much-opposition-anymore-er.  and a stark death is just filling the status quo.
- if the red wedding happens because of those leeches, i'll be disappointed.
- i don't think arya will reunite with cat as planned by the hound
- have i made a joke yet about bran seeing the future through a raven and That's So Raven?  because now i have
- tywin's gonna RAAAAGEEEE at tyrion
- i am still interested in jon and sam's stories but have nothing to say or predict
And if anyone calls me a "sweet summer child" tell them i say don't hate me because you ain't me."

2151	bobbybuilderton	2013-05-22	How is Robb dying at the wedding not a game changer? Unless he thinks only Robb will die. I've seen that a lot and it excites me. So many people are not expecting the entire north rebellion to be crushed. And I bet you're kicking yourself for that Talisa comment.
2152	shiola	2013-05-22	You guys who are saying the show is missing the mark with certain characters are talking to the wrong show watchers.It seems most of you hang out with folks who need to be spoon fed details and can't figure out main character names by season 3. That isn't the shows fault.Don't judge who we watch the show with by the few sentences a week you hear about them.  Some people are bad with names.  I am bad with names too.  I wouldn't know half of them if I didn't read the books.  And a lot of them are weird sounding names to English speakers.  Cool it with your self-righteously toned judgement.
2153	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-05-22	I guess people don't feel Robb has any shot of winning anything since the last time Tywin Lannister seemed at all worried was mid season 2. Another reason they should've stuck to the "Let's go back and recapture the North" story but oh well.

So many people are not expecting the entire north rebellion to be crushed. And I bet you're kicking yourself for that Talisa comment.He thinks only Robb.  And I'm not kicking myself too much because whenever someone's happy on the show, I immediately get nervous for them and let it show even though I've read the books.  I told him, "No matter who was pregnant, I would have said that.  Like when Dany was pregnant and both of us were like oh haaaale no.  Same thing."  So I mean, I regret saying it a bit, because I have a habit of not SHUTTING THE FUCK UP even though I never outright spoil.  But, at the same time, it's such a small comment and such an obvious thing in GoT world that I don't think it's a huuuuuge deal.  Maybe I'm just trying to save myself some anger hahaBut yeah, only Robb.  Cat dying will send him into a fucking rage.  I'll be surprised if he watches the finale right away.  He might need to wait a little while.  He loves her.

2166	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-22	BABY-NOT-RANDALL SOUNDS SO SASSY AHAHAHA
2167	bobbybuilderton	2013-05-22	poking around various boards and comments, many unsullied seem to think Jaime's injury means he will be kicked out of the kingsguard for some reason.
2168	Lord O' Bones	2013-05-22	Weird. He already proved he can still fight. Not so well perhaps, but regular meals and some new training and he'll be alright.
2169	ugashep	2013-05-22	Theda and BobbyBuilderton, I had to dip out on our discussion last night to put in a long day at work. Essentially we have a philosophical difference, no big deal. I don't think that a person has any moral culpability for killing if it is in defense of themselves or others. That's the way the law has come down historically also, I get the sense that at least Bobby thinks that someone who lets himself be killed or let's someone else be killed when he/she has the ability to stop it is somehow morally superior to someone who chooses to kill in defense of himself or that other person. I just disagree with that view that's all. Enjoyed the discussion.

2170	A Bear covered in Fluff	2013-05-23	My boyfriend thinks the red wedding had something to do with the red woman
2171	bobbybuilderton	2013-05-23	My friend thinks that the person who has Theon is more obvious than the bastard from house Bolton. Overall, he finds what's going on in KL to be way more interesting than everything else. However, he is intrigued by the lord of light stuff
"I think gendry is going to escape, rob stark is going to die before aria gets to him. Bran is going to do something I'm not interested in and tyrions life is gonna suck. Btw I'm going crazy about everything that's happening in kings landing."
Him:Little fingers is a cruel man
Me: Lol Littlefinger is THE BEST
Him:He's pretty scary. I'd venture to say he's the most powerful man in westeros. I'm pretty worried for sansa because of him.
Me: But sansa has tyrion to protect her
Him:Lord balish-if that's how you spell it- is pretty cunning though. He found out about what happened with that one important whore lady and had Joffrey kill her. I'm sure he can find a way through tyrion.
Me: Tyrion outsmarted him when he found out the old guy was cerseis spy
Him: Right. I forgot about that. Man...This is so much more interesting than the wars.
Me: Well lucky for you, Tywin seems pretty confident the war is almost over. Which is weird because nobodys done much fighting this season

2172	Currawong	2013-05-23	That's what I thought, but in interviews they keep repeating that it's "one book over two seasons". Bran's ADwD material will certainly be pushed forward. I thought Dany's would be too, but she can't leave Slaver's Bay until all the other characters have arrived.They actually haven't said 'one book over two seasons' at all.  What D&D have said that as from Season 3, they are not working on the basis of so many seasons per book - rather, they are concentrating on telling the overall story in the best way they can for TV.   On a 'very rough' basis, they indicated that ASOS will cover Season 3 and the first half of Season 4 (so around 15 episodes), but they have also made it clear that things would be moved around slightly as required to make sense in the story as a whole.  This explains why we have had Theon torture in Season 3, when effectively he 'disappeared' in the books for a long time and we only got his memories of what happened to him.	We've already seen that happen between Seasons 2 and 3, where the Tullys and Riverrun were held over to S3, but some part of the Jaime and Brienne journey was brought forward.  And of course, thinking of 'seasons per book' makes no sense when it comes to AFFC and ADWD, because those books are mostly in parallel - the TV show will have to re-integrate them so as to keep events in chronological order, and avoid having main characters disappear for a season or more.

2173	Montey14	2013-05-23	Every time I see that a non-reader thought Sansa was cruel and that they felt sorry for Tyrion a little part of me dies inside.We have the luxury of knowing all of Tyrios asides in the book....a show watcher would just see a pretty girl spurning a poor little dwarf .....but I guess it would be cruel to remind the non readers that is family is responsible for practically wiping out her family....and that she is for all intents and purposes...still a hostage.....perhaps Sophie Turner could do a better job of looking emotionally inaccessable and completely numb ...In the books...she is describred perfectly as "being alone in the world"....

2175	TerpsPwn_387	2013-05-23	I have a few friends that have watched every episode and they are not too good with names as well.  One of my friends, as of 5 episodes ago referred to Dany as "Dragon Lady".  I think it is how the show is written.  There are a lot of moving parts and a lot of characters so it is probably easier to remember faces and not names.

I think it is how the show is written.  There are a lot of moving parts and a lot of characters so it is probably easier to remember faces and not names.Not that I know your friend at all, but I'd say most people who are still talking about the "Dragon Lady"  or "The Funny Dwarf" etc.  just aren't paying attention to the show. In E4 Dany shouts out her name - with free subtitles for all the world to see. Thinking she's called Khaleesi (which to my unending frustration my mother still does) is maybe a bit more forgivable but it really does make me worry about how these people are following any of the plot when they can't even remember names. Though I suppose for the average member of the public it's easier to remember who's being murdered today than it is to remember their complex fantasy names.
2177	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-23	I laugh everytime someone thinks Dany is called Khaleesi or Tyrion is called Imp. I mean, SERIOUSLY. Or still call Jaime Kingslayer. 
''Melisandre'' = Melly Sanders
AHAHAHAHH
2178	Stannisfan	2013-05-23	My boyfriend who only watches for Dany has already decided Daario is 'not good enough' for her.

Blame your friends' mothers for smoking during the pregnancy, because there is no way someone can be that dumb otherwise. /agree.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':agree:' /> This, is not the show's fault if someone has not been paying attention, I could understand people not knowing secondary character names (like Qhorin halfhand or the members of the Night's Watch). But if you don't know Dany, Tyrion, Davos or Cat's names, then your friends are watching the wrong show or not paying attention at all

2183	Mother of Mini Dragons	2013-05-23	So my Dad is catching onto the leeches. But he skipped over the Robb and Balon part and is all "Joffrey's going to die! Yeah!"
He's really suspicious about the crows/ravens that were near Sam so I trolled him a bit and made a big deal about the Night's Watch being called "Crows" and then I veered him off by talking about the heart tree and reminding him that Sam took his vows at one with Jon.
Otherwise, all my conversations with him now are all "Dany, Dany, Dany - My Queen and Arya, Arya, Arya - She's going to kick ass! and when is Joffery going to die?" lather, rinse, repeat...
2184	Fychan	2013-05-24	During the Cersei/Marg scene my unsullied daughter quipped "Boy that Cersei has no idea how to play the game.  She thinks she so smart, but really needs to think before she speaks!"

2186	shiola	2013-05-24	That Melly Sanders thing might be intentional.

I didn't know if it's a prediction or if someone spoiled him about ADwD; I didn't know how to ask him without making him suspicious.
2197	Arkash	2013-05-25	I got one friend too who asked me to spoil him the whole story because he finds it interesting to watch the show with this knowledge and still getting some surprises since he hasnt read the books and I kept some details under silence.
2198	Gendels Children	2013-05-25	yeah one of my friends asked if Jon dies, I was like "ahhhhh...." and she was like "OH MY GOD!" I then told her the short answer is I don't actually know.. I had Jons stabbing ruined for me when I was simply a few pages away, two of my friends at I were all reading it together, but I actually worked full time so they got far ahead of me, one of them for some reason assumed I knew and mentioned it... I was super heart broken! I would never ruin things for someone if they were reading the books or didn't want me to tell them because I know how much that sucks

I mean, I guess I can't blame him, they changed the scene where Ramsay betrayed the Northmen, and don't have the benefit of all the stories of his wickedness.

2207	Caryn Stark	2013-06-02	So my non- reader friend just told me she doesn't care much for Robb, that chick of his or Catelyn - who doesn't do much. It's official. D&D have ruined their storylines.
2208	lyanna_maria	2013-06-04	I know I'm late, but my unsullied friend doesn't keep up with the rythm and watches the episodes a week or so later. I talked to him the other day about Sansa and Tyrion, and it seems that it was impossible for him to believe Sansa/Sophie had 14 years old: he just couldn't but it and laughed, so he felt a lot less sympathetic to Sansa than expected. Also, he didn't like the fact that Tyrion got drunk: he said he prefers him to be self-possessed and with his senses sharp. I argued that he is witty all the same, or even more, but that was his opinion.
2209	King in the North Carolina	2013-06-30	So my non- reader friend just told me she doesn't care much for Robb, that chick of his or Catelyn - who doesn't do much. It's official. D&D have ruined their storylines.To be fair, it was pretty easy not to care about Book Robb.

2211	Mr Smith	2013-05-14	I'm anticipating that we're going to meet Coldhands in the coming episode (assuming they haven't cut him altogether, which would be a whole other thing). As far as I'm aware, there are two major theories on who Coldhands is. One is that he is the Night's King, a Lord Commander during the Age of Heroes who supposedly to an Other to wife and began to rule the Nights Watch like a king until being put down by both the King in the North and the King Beyond the Wall. The other is that he is in fact Benjen Stark.
Although I am personally open to both theories, this post assumes that Coldhands is in fact Jon's uncle, lost beyond the wall. If so, this will have posed something of a problem for the writers: we already know what Benjen looks like. They could through a cloth over most of his face, true, but the viewers probably haven't forgotten Benjen completely, and may still recognise his voice.
The writers may have encountered a similar problem this season with Astran/Barristan, but given that the readers at least knew who Astran really was, decided to chop the knot and reveal his true identity immediately. For obvious reasons they can't do this with "Benjen".
Unless its done carefully, either one of the two major theories mentioned above will be ruled out for the readership.
Thoughts?
2212	Fredwin	2013-05-19	I'm sure Coldhands won't be cast until Bran needs him to be cast. So maybe not until the next 1 or 2 seasons depending how they handle Bran's arc.
2213	TheGreenBell	2013-05-19	I was waiting too.  /dunno.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':dunno:' /> /dunno.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':dunno:' />
2214	baxter	2013-05-19	Can someone please fill me in on why Coldhands can't be introduced later?  Wasn't he introduced in the book when Sam comes in the secret entrance?  Because can't they just be swarmed by wights after this scene and he show up with the ravens?
					
					
							Edited by baxter, 19 May 2013 - 09:35 PM.
2215	WinterWarrior	2013-05-19	I think Coldhands will show up sooner rather than later...and I don't think he is Uncle Benjen or whomever. I think he is just a former Crow who now serves Bloodraven. Maybe he was Bloodraven's steward when he was Lord Commander of the Nights Watch or something like that. Or maybe we will never know who he is and he never appears in the books again.....
I like him though and hope he shows up soon. I think Bran will end up at the Wall soon.
2216	Montey14	2013-05-19	Can someone please fill me in on why Coldhands can't be introduced later?  Wasn't he introduced in the book when Sam comes in the secret entrance?this wasn't the secret entrance though....this is when sam becomes Sam the slayer .... Cold hands comes in post Red and Purple wedding
2217	Naathi Prince	2013-05-19	He's not Benjen. Benjen didn't die "long ago".
There, problem solved.
2218	Darth Pipes	2013-05-19	I'm hoping Coldhands will be introduced like he is in the books...helping Sam out when he's surrounded by wights.  I don't know if the show will do that though.
2219	dtones520	2013-05-19	They don't really need to cast a high paid actor as Coldhands. His face is covered the whole time we see him in the books. They could realistically just have an extra play him and use someone as a voiceover who is already on the payroll. So, I don't think worrying about casting budget will really effect whether or not we get Coldhands.
2220	Lord_Ravenstone	2013-05-19	Wait....nevermind.

They probably just do away with the character.

Offhand or not, I'm not going to say someone who has been dead for a year or two died "long ago" nor is that exact wording necessary to get it across to Bran that Coldhands is safe.

Personally, I think it was a sly attempt by GRRM to throw the readers off while still leaving the other possibility open. As he always says, words are wind.

As he always says, words are wind.There are a million ways to say "this person is dead" without saying "this person has been dead for a long time". Leaf did the second. Ergo, Coldhands has been dead for a long time. Saying words are wind is just a silly way of admitting the text does not support your thesis.
2233	Lord Paolo Stark	2013-05-19	But Sam killed him exactly when he was supposed too, so I don't see where you are coming from.In the books Sam slays the Other when the Night's Watch was running away from the Fist of the First Men, before going into Craster's Keepthat's where they starting to call him Sam the Slayerand then when he's with Gilly in the shed, they were under attack by wights, and there's where Coldhands appears and saves them

2234	ugashep	2013-05-19	As several others have said, the child of the forest says the wights killed coldhands "long ago" which considering their life span far outlasts humans they surely did not mean just a year or two ago. People want Benjen to come back I understand and maybe he will, he just ain't coldhands.
2235	kephv	2013-05-19	There are a million ways to say "this person is dead" without saying "this person has been dead for a long time". Leaf did the second. Ergo, Coldhands has been dead for a long time. Saying words are wind is just a silly way of admitting the text does not support your thesis.How long is a long time? Tyrion says he died long ago (in KL) in his second or third chapter. And it's not me who says words are wind -- that's something GRRM has been trying to make a point of, else he wouldn't repeat it so much.

2236	Dr. Pepper	2013-05-19	I'm sure Coldhands won't be cast until Bran needs him to be cast. So maybe not until the next 1 or 2 seasons depending how they handle Bran's arc.I agree.  Coldhands has more to do with Bran than with Sam.  I hadn't been expecting Bran to go through the Nightfort this season so I wasn't expecting Coldhands either.
2237	stunningsteve	2013-05-19	The ravens obviously were a sign of Coldhands presence and they warned Sam and Gilly of the arrving other. However I'm not sure if we do see him this season. We know that Sam meets Bran in the Nightfort in E10, but the Sam/Coldhands meeting might be off-screen, which would suck undoubtely, while his on-screen-debut would be in the beginning of season 4 while meeting up with Bran. I hope we will get him this season, but doubt that we will get further information of his identity.

And it's not me who says words are word -- that's something GRRM has been trying to make a point of, else he wouldn't repeat it so much.A long time is pretty self-evident when it comes to death. It means years. Many years. Words are wind is used when talking about people discussing what they will do to pay you back and such, no comments like the one lead said to Bran. It literally makes no sense to use that argument in this circumstance.

It literally makes no sense to use that argument in this circumstance.Two years is a long time to be dead, I'd say. And words are wind is a general statement - he's simply pointing to the fact that they can be very misleading, as they are here.Also, as I mentioned, other characters have made offhand remarks to events taking place a long time ago when in fact they haven't (even for a human).
2240	Tom son of Tom	2013-05-19	do you think they'll end the season like last time w/ Sam surrounded by Wights?  That would be disappointing to me.  But who cares, RW next episode baby!Yeah, so they can begin next season with a black screen and all you hear are screams and Sam whining. Would be so awesome....
2241	Lord Paolo Stark	2013-05-19	Two years is a long time to be dead, I'd say.

2242	Lionofwar87	2013-05-19	Did any one notice it was the same Other from the season 2 finale? The one that looked at...I mean towards Samwell.
I was looking forward to Coldhands /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' /> Could have just kept him on the elk, face covered, saying one or two silghtly audible words at a time.
2243	Kasrith	2013-05-19	this wasn't the secret entrance though....this is when sam becomes Sam the slayer .... Cold hands comes in post Red and Purple weddingBut the secret enterance is soon (it is def in this season as per the pre season trailers) and so Coldhands has to be in the next episode. Which would totally make sense since they had all the birds around when Slayer did the deed
2244	Kasrith	2013-05-19	The ravens obviously were a sign of Coldhands presence and they warned Sam and Gilly of the arrving other. However I'm not sure if we do see him this season.

I hope we will get him this season, but doubt that we will get further information of his identity.I think this is very possible.. Have Sam show up and meet Bran, tell him about the passage and how someone is waiting on the other side, finishing the episode with Bran crawling (or whatever) through the darkness - revealing him to viewers since the Sam/Coldhands interaction is likely off screen.S4 opens up with him coming up on the other side and Coldhands welcoming the group (which is now minus Osha/Rickon since she vowed not to cross the Wall)
2245	HouseHarrison	2013-05-19	Cutting Coldhands is unacceptable imo, he really stirs things up in Bran's plot. We'll see him, I can see the last scene of episode 10 being his introduction as the seasons tend to end on a big "magical" notes (dragons, Others, etc.)
2246	Kyrion	2013-05-19	I think the opening of Episode 9 will be the coldhands scene. They like to do this I think, like with Jaime's hand in Episode 4' end in Jaime scene in Episode 3 and start with a Jaime scene episode 4
All those ravens were epic but weren't in the trailers we saw, we saw Ravens coming out of someones cloak, presumably Coldhands in the trailers. So well definitely see Coldhands this season, Im thinking start of Episode 9 but maybe start of Episode 10, so they can lead him to Bran in the Nightfort.
What was really interesting about this scene was what they showed with the weirwood tree. letting us know that the Old gods are watching, that they have powers much like the Lord of Light, and definitely that Coldhands of commanded by the powers of the Old Gods.....Bloodraven is still a mystery, but this weirwood tree scene tells me the writers planned this for a reason
2247	go joff go	2013-05-19	So did the Sam the slayer scene happen in front of a Weirwood tree in the book?  That seemed like a pretty important detail.
2248	kephv	2013-05-19	No. The later scene with Chett wight did though. He prays to it beforehand, which was significant.
2249	ebevan91	2013-05-19	Surely all of those ravens will mean something, right? Didn't those ravens start eating the Others and allow Sam/Gilly to escape in the book?
2250	kephv	2013-05-19	They ate the wights. Perhaps next episode there will be wight eating.
2251	cybobbie	2013-05-19	Well I don't believe in the theory that Coldhands is Benjen, so I dont see a problem and in any case in the books he is always with his face covered. I only will be very disappointed if they don't use him in the show and considering all the crows in the scene and that the scene happened in the place (or at least it looks like) where Coldhands come to help Sam, I'm expecting to see him this season.
2252	WolframTarant	2013-05-19	All those ravens were epic but weren't in the trailers we saw, we saw Ravens coming out of someones cloak, presumably Coldhands in the trailers.Can someone link me to this trailer? I feel like I've seen them all a hundred times but I can't remember this.First post by the way.... hello!
2253	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2013-05-20	Was that a shot of the elks face or the weirwoods tree face while same was in the hut?
2254	Dove	2013-05-20	I'm absolutely dying to know if the ravens were just a cool ~spooky detail~ of the scene/maybe a little nod to the books or if they mean Coldhands is appearing this season.Can someone link me to this trailer? I feel like I've seen them all a hundred times but I can't remember this.First post by the way.... hello!Same here, this doesn't sound remotely familiar. A link to the trailer or a gif I guess would be great. (also welcome)
2255	Thor Odinson	2013-05-20	I'm just throwing this out there, but it's possible for Coldhands to appear without being cast yet. If you watch The Walking Dead, Michonne's first appearance in the season finale before last was a brief cameo with a different actress filling in. She wasn't cast until the following season. So as long as Coldhands makes a brief non-speaking appearance then there's no need to cast him until next season, as anybody can wear the costume to make a brief non-speaking appearance.
2256	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2013-05-20	I think this is very possible.. Have Sam show up and meet Bran, tell him about the passage and how someone is waiting on the other side, finishing the episode with Bran crawling (or whatever) through the darkness - revealing him to viewers since the Sam/Coldhands interaction is likely off screen.S4 opens up with him coming up on the other side and Coldhands welcoming the group (which is now minus Osha/Rickon since she vowed not to cross the Wall)Slight change to your scene. Have sam say  there's someone to meet him on  the other side of the wal. Rickon and osha split from the rest and go to where ever. then bran goes through the door, we see or hear a bunch of ravens bran looks around and sees coldhands.You don't even really need to cast a actor to play the role, it could be a extra like Beric was the first season.
2257	A Winters Summer	2013-05-20	I'm absolutely dying to know if the ravens were just a cool ~spooky detail~ of the scene/maybe a little nod to the books or if they mean Coldhands is appearing this season.Same here, this doesn't sound remotely familiar.

2261	Howdyphillip	2013-05-20	My favorite crackpot theory I have come up with is that Coldhands is Aegon V who is Egg from the Dunk and Egg stories. I think that Bloodraven saved him from the fires of Summerhall and he joined the Nights watch anonymously out of grief for the death of his son Duncan the Small.

2264	Howdyphillip	2013-05-20	Actually, that theory has been around for a while now.Yeah, for about two years when I first mentioned it. I don't believe that anyone had that before I wrote about it, but I could be mistaken.
2265	boojam	2013-05-20	No Coldhands yet, no problem.
People obsess over mole hills!
2266	Leto	2013-05-20	lousy mole hills
2267	Mulled Wino	2013-05-20	Means nothing. It was an offhand comment to get Bran to stop worrying about him, not a definitive statement on his age.Not true.  The cotf wasn't just making any offhand comments.  Coldhands isnt benjen.  The comment is very telling.
2268	David Selig	2013-05-20	Why would that be a problem for the show?It's not like they give a damn about minor fan theories...
2269	Mulled Wino	2013-05-20	I've given my view on this already. In short, it wasn't anything definite, and dead is dead no matter how long one has lived,huh?  I would never say someone's been dead for a long time that was dead for a year.  The only thing clearer would have been if Leaf said, "bran, that isnt your uncle benjen on that elk, just in can you were wondering."
2270	The Fourth Head	2013-05-20	All Coldhands has to do between now and the end of season 4 is ride an elk, scare off the wights and rescue Sam and Gilly. He doesn't have to talk, or reveal his face. A hooded face, a flat, dull voice, they could avoid revealing Coldhand's identity throughout seasons 5 and 6 too if they wanted to, but there is a risk this man is being overrated. He could be a random man of the nights watch. If he was Benjen Stark, why didn't Bran recognise him? All this guy does is help Sam get to the wall, and Bran get to Bloodraven- something both were trying to do anyway. He's not essential to the plot.
2271	-Ghost-	2013-05-20	I really thought we were gettin CH. they fuckin tricked me
2272	Gendels Children	2013-05-20	I  pretty sure they wouldn't cut him, but we might not actually meet him until next season
2273	Jorah the Explorer	2013-05-20	For what it's worth, I immediately assumed Coldhands was Benjen while reading and continued to do so.  If true it answers two mysteries, namely "What happened to Benjen Stark?" and "Who is Coldhands?".  The fact that they are both beyond the wall makes it fit like an ice cold glove.  Yeah, Martin could end up making it different, but I (mostly) prefer loose ends to be tied rather than opening new ones with random characters.  Perhaps Martin intended Coldhands to be Benjen while writing A Storm of Swords, but changed his mind when he caught the bloat disease during Feast and Dance.
2274	Stannis the Menace	2013-05-20	They don't really need to cast a high paid actor as Coldhands. His face is covered the whole time we see him in the books. They could realistically just have an extra play him and use someone as a voiceover who is already on the payroll. So, I don't think worrying about casting budget will really effect whether or not we get Coldhands.This
2275	Amoracchius	2013-05-20	He's not Benjen. Benjen didn't die "long ago".There, problem solved.This is what I always thought. Also, given that Sam recognizes various members of the NW after they became wights, if Coldhands were Benjen, wouldn't Bran have recognized his own uncle?
2276	lostinwesteros	2013-05-20	He's not Benjen. Benjen didn't die "long ago".There, problem solved.Yes.  Although I love Benjen along with everyone else and would like nothing better than for him to return [as yet he may], Coldhands was born long ago.  My vote is that he is TNK, but that's a whole other thread.I've been waiting for CH ever since the assassination went down at Craster's Keep and thought that surely he would appear in last night's episode.  /crying.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':crying:' />  If they take him out altogether, though -- or really shortchange him, like I think they've done with so many of my favorite characters/scenes, I'll be /bawl.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bawl:' /> AND /tantrum.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':tantrum:' />
2277	Joyful Union	2013-05-20	I wish we would get Coldhands, but if I put myself in a non-bookreaders shoes, it's probably best he's not in the show.
I mean, dude turns up surrounded by ravens, is icy blue cold, and rides a bloody elk. Most people's reactions would be "Who the fuck is this clown?"

2279	Social Justice Bass	2013-05-20	You don't need to have him ride an elk. You could just have him riding a horse, or even a dead horse like the Others do.
My guess is they'll just use an extra, if they include him at all.
2280	siknes	2013-05-20	He's not Benjen. Benjen didn't die "long ago".There, problem solved.What is the definition of long ago? Just not yesterday--for sure.  A few years ago-which is the actual time frame in the books.  or hundred of years ago-which would be your theory.  Now the other details are covered face, NW black clothes, but there is no mention of the clothes being faded and ratty, which with GRRM's attention to detail would have been written. Another fact out there that it isn't Benjen is Bran would have recognized his voice, but Bran is young and rarely saw Benjen, Benjen was close to Jon.  Now we know all the Starks are Wargs, I am guessing that it was Lyanna and Benjen on the horses that Bran saw thru the tree-net.  Now hear is my way out there theory.  Part of it is the fact that D & D knew from the get go the overall direction of the storyline.  They have Benjen's small part at the beginning, in the dining hall, he looks like he is in deep contemplation of something he was to do.  I think the "Old Gods"  used him as a proxy to give all the 5 Stark children and the Winged- Wolf their gift,  He(Ben) when still alive Warged a stag and slew the Mother Dire-wolf, it is just not a natural occurance.  Benjen, Knowing he wouldn't be able to live mortally in the Fore-ever Winter land, gives himself as a sacrifice, but the Old Gods grant him his own consciousness.  The whole "I'm your monster Bran Stark"  to me means he is Benjen, protecting Bran.  If I am wrong and it is the Night's King or something else, I believe it would be a former Brandon Stark, GRRM loves double meanings is what he writes.  What do you people think. I have only read thru once, and am not sure if there was a dead body of the  Stag, when the Starks found the pups.  No Stag body would give credence to my theory.  Also, I am  on this theory because there have been no sightings of any other Dire-wolves, N or S of the Wall.   Shout out to Nymeria/ Ghost union, the Starks need more pups once all is said and done, all the King's of the N had Wolves at the foot of their statues. Keep the tradition going.

2282	Amoracchius	2013-05-20	in terms of deathlong time ago means like yearssomeone who died 1 year ago or 2 years ago is not considered a long timeEspecially given that it's Leaf who says it. For 200 year old COTF, "long ago" is probably a long freaking time.
2283	Bastard of Baltimore	2013-05-20	Since we saw a scene in the previews of Sam running into Bran and company in what looked like the Nightfort, I think we will see coldhands this season as he escorts Sam and Gilly to the black gate.  I am guessing he will be 100% CGI. Additionally, the murder of Ravens at the end of last episode further supports we will see Coldhands.
2284	siknes	2013-05-20	he's a special wight, so, why would Benjen be special wightdo you know the Night King story?he married a female other and it would be very logical, if she turned him in a special wight, in the name of their loveBenjen is alive, that's my opinionBut the Others Warg dead things, Coldhands is only Warging live creatures, the Stag and flock of crows.
2285	Kasrith	2013-05-20	Slight change to your scene. Have sam say  there's someone to meet him on  the other side of the wal. Rickon and osha split from the rest and go to where ever. then bran goes through the door, we see or hear a bunch of ravens bran looks around and sees coldhands.You don't even really need to cast a actor to play the role, it could be a extra like Beric was the first season.I think it'll be a stronger effect/cliffhanger if the fade to black of the episode happens as he goes through the tunnel - literally into darkness. Then start off with an elk riding/crow surrounded/coldhanded dude with blue eyes. Great start to a season.Whereas if Bran meets him in the finale, there's no really surprise/energy to carry the beginning of the next season for the Bran arc other than more talking. Everyone is already growing tired of dialogue, having Sam shock them in the Nightfort for a finale, and Coldhands waiting for them on the other end to start s4 gives some momentum for both events.
2286	Mychel_Redfort	2013-05-20	What makes me think that Coldhands is Benjen is that GRRM so much likes foreshadowing. In aGoT, when Yoren tells Bran he thinks Benjen is dead, Bran replies : "The children will help him," he blurted, "the children of the forest!". And when we meet the Children in the books, who are they collaborating with ? Coldhands...
As for having died for a long time, Benjen clearly doesn't want to reveal himself to Bran. So what if he has asked the Children to lie about him, rather than having them giving unexpectedly clues to his identity to Bran ?
2287	Tywin's bastard	2013-05-20	You don't need to have him ride an elk. You could just have him riding a horse, or even a dead horse like the Others do.My guess is they'll just use an extra, if they include him at all.Yes, I'd have him ride a horse so you don't have to do some fairly pointless CGI for every scene he's in. He should be pretty easy to include with that change.

Shout out to Nymeria/ Ghost union, the Starks need more pups once all is said and done, all the King's of the N had Wolves at the foot of their statues. Keep the tradition going.We DO NOT know for certain that all of the Starks have some kind of warging ability. Do we? Bran, Jon and Arya do (in the books, and only Bran does thus far in the show), but none of the rest of the Stark kids really exhibit more than just a really close relationship with their wolves, and there is absolutely no evidence that Benjen or any other adult Starks have it. Judging from the way that no one but Osha really believes Bran when he tells him about his wolf dreams, I think it's safe to say that the ability has all but died out in the old families south of the Wall. As for what Ben is contemplating in the first book during the feast, it was probably the sudden rash of wildlings trying to cross the Wall, Mance Raydar's forces gathering, and the disappearances of his brothers that remained unexplained. The guy had a lot on his mind, but there's no reason to think that he was acting on orders from the Old Gods or something. As for the debate about timing and what Leaf really meant, I agree that 'long ago' probably does not mean 'three years ago or less', but at least a few decades.Personally, I think CH is the Night's King. I also think there is a lot more to that story than anyone knows about. We don't know anything about what happened because all the records from that time were destroyed, and I don't think it's ever explicitly stated that the NK was actually killed, or his body destroyed, only that he was taken from power. I know he was consorting with Others and everything, but the reaction from the Night's Watch seems to be a bit overboard, and I think there's more to it that they didn't want getting out. There's also something bugging me about the difference in eye color... because, in all other respects, save for the fact that he seemed to retain his memory and personality and free will, CH is, for all intents and purposes, a wight, correct? Except that he doesn't share the weird blue eyes that the Others and all the other wights do. That can't be a coincidence, so maybe just bringing the wights back doesn't automatically preclude them being under the Others' control (and if this has been hashed out on other threads, my apologies for the repeat, I'm new to this forum). Part of the story of the Night's King was that he supposedly put all of his brothers under some sort of spell to control them. Has the possibility ever been raised that they were actually all killed and turned into wights? Because "freeing" them once the NK and his queen were defeated could have a lot of different meanings, and most NW brothers would probably prefer a peaceful death to being turned into a zombie... this could all mean nothing, of course, but then it could all circle back to what's happened to Jon in aDwD. Just a few way-off-topic thoughts.

2290	herworship429	2013-05-20	Well, didn't the description for episode 10 say something about Bran telling ghost stories? I'm guessing that puts Bran and company at Nightfort by the end of this season. So my guess is we see a bit of Coldhands during that episode with Sam and Gilly (probably he doesn't even speak, they just see him on his elk, or horse, or whatever, or with his ravens, for a few seconds following a wight attack, then cut to something else), and then he pops up again next season when Bran, Meera, Jojen and Hodor emerge on the other side of the Wall.
2291	siknes	2013-05-20	We DO NOT know for certain that all of the Starks have some kind of warging ability. Do we? Bran, Jon and Arya do (in the books, and only Bran does thus far in the show), but none of the rest of the Stark kids really exhibit more than just a really close relationship with their wolves, and there is absolutely no evidence that Benjen or any other adult Starks have it. Judging from the way that no one but Osha really believes Bran when he tells him about his wolf dreams, I think it's safe to say that the ability has all but died out in the old families south of the Wall. As for what Ben is contemplating in the first book during the feast, it was probably the sudden rash of wildlings trying to cross the Wall, Mance Raydar's forces gathering, and the disappearances of his brothers that remained unexplained. The guy had a lot on his mind, but there's no reason to think that he was acting on orders from the Old Gods or something. As for the debate about timing and what Leaf really meant, I agree that 'long ago' probably does not mean 'three years ago or less', but at least a few decades.Personally, I think CH is the Night's King. I also think there is a lot more to that story than anyone knows about. We don't know anything about what happened because all the records from that time were destroyed, and I don't think it's ever explicitly stated that the NK was actually killed, or his body destroyed, only that he was taken from power. I know he was consorting with Others and everything, but the reaction from the Night's Watch seems to be a bit overboard, and I think there's more to it that they didn't want getting out.

Just a few way-off-topic thoughts.GRRM has said that all the Stark's are Wargs, Ned is the only one of his generation that has forgotten, Brandon, Lyanna and Benjen were always wild chidren, like they were one with their horse.  The Mormonts are Wargs also, LC Mort, just couldn't totally control his raven, until he was dead and was the final straw emerging from the kettle and landing on Jon. The daughter told Asha that she is a warg in a Japing way, but I think there is truth in it.
2292	Serr Parker	2013-05-20	We'll probably just see the back of him at the end of the 10th episode, then properly cast him for S04. They may change character if it is Benjen, Beric was in S01 and they changed actors they could easily do it with him, especially since he's been beyond the wall for a year or two
2293	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-20	Well, didn't the description for episode 10 say something about Bran telling ghost stories? I'm guessing that puts Bran and company at Nightfort by the end of this season. So my guess is we see a bit of Coldhands during that episode with Sam and Gilly (probably he doesn't even speak, they just see him on his elk, or horse, or whatever, or with his ravens, for a few seconds following a wight attack, then cut to something else), and then he pops up again next season when Bran, Meera, Jojen and Hodor emerge on the other side of the Wall.That might be a pretty good way to end the season. Have Catelyn come back as stoneheart maybe and/or a creepy figure on a gigantic elk with crows all around. has the magical vibe that always ends the seasons.
2294	BendTheKnee610	2013-05-20	The Slayer scene was shown in the episode recap on the youtube channel. That seems to indicate that we'll get another Sam scene in episode 9; that's probably where they'll introduce Coldhands.
2295	Kasrith	2013-05-20	I really thought we were gettin CH. they fuckin tricked meI doubt he's cut. I just see him appearing in s4 to Bran in the North. They don't necessarily have to show us the interaction between him and Sam. The crows/ravens at the end of the episode were enough to get curiosity going.
2296	The Red Pope	2013-05-20	Especially given that it's Leaf who says it. For 200 year old COTF, "long ago" is probably a long freaking time.Look at the context, 2 years is a very long time in a zombie apocalypse. Just saying.
2297	QueenBeyondtheWeb	2013-05-20	CH theory I haven't seen (but I'm new here)
Could he be one of the children from Others mating with wildlings like is said in the stories and legends? A half-human, half-Other?
2298	Naathi Prince	2013-05-20	Two years is a long time to be dead, I'd say. And words are wind is a general statement - he's simply pointing to the fact that they can be very misleading, as they are here.Also, as I mentioned, other characters have made offhand remarks to events taking place a long time ago when in fact they haven't (even for a human).There is no evidence whatsoever that this is a statement that doesn't mean exactly what it says. None whatsoever.
2299	Kasporio	2013-05-20	The question is, imo, not who coldhands was, but why did he retained self-awareness. Other wights retain only some memories, for sure, but are slow and unintelligent.
CH seems to be free willed and move as fast as a living being. He obeys to bloodraven, since he is escorted by crows under the control of the former, but he slaughtered a bunch of NW deserters for no obvious purposes. Don't think he is someone knowledgeable, and if he is Ben Stark, think he had tried to interact with Bran. Well, they were no shown to be close in the book and he could be reluctant to show to a relative what monster he became.
2300	Naathi Prince	2013-05-20	What is the definition of long ago? Just not yesterday--for sure.  A few years ago-which is the actual time frame in the books.  or hundred of years ago-which would be your theory.  Now the other details are covered face, NW black clothes, but there is no mention of the clothes being faded and ratty, which with GRRM's attention to detail would have been written. Another fact out there that it isn't Benjen is Bran would have recognized his voice, but Bran is young and rarely saw Benjen, Benjen was close to Jon.  Now we know all the Starks are Wargs, I am guessing that it was Lyanna and Benjen on the horses that Bran saw thru the tree-net.  Now hear is my way out there theory.  Part of it is the fact that D & D knew from the get go the overall direction of the storyline.  They have Benjen's small part at the beginning, in the dining hall, he looks like he is in deep contemplation of something he was to do.  I think the "Old Gods"  used him as a proxy to give all the 5 Stark children and the Winged- Wolf their gift,  He(Ben) when still alive Warged a stag and slew the Mother Dire-wolf, it is just not a natural occurance.  Benjen, Knowing he wouldn't be able to live mortally in the Fore-ever Winter land, gives himself as a sacrifice, but the Old Gods grant him his own consciousness.  The whole "I'm your monster Bran Stark"  to me means he is Benjen, protecting Bran.  If I am wrong and it is the Night's King or something else, I believe it would be a former Brandon Stark, GRRM loves double meanings is what he writes.  What do you people think. I have only read thru once, and am not sure if there was a dead body of the  Stag, when the Starks found the pups.  No Stag body would give credence to my theory.  Also, I am  on this theory because there have been no sightings of any other Dire-wolves, N or S of the Wall.   Shout out to Nymeria/ Ghost union, the Starks need more pups once all is said and done, all the King's of the N had Wolves at the foot of their statues. Keep the tradition going.Ok, so that was tldr, but the important part that actually goes to the crux of the matter...long ago to someone who is over 200 years old is not last year or the year before that or even the Bush presidency. Long ago is LONG AGO. I really don't see the confusion here over a turn of phrase that is very obvious.
2301	baxter	2013-05-20	GRRM has said that all the Stark's are Wargs, Ned is the only one of his generation that has forgotten, Brandon, Lyanna and Benjen were always wild chidren, like they were one with their horse.

The daughter told Asha that she is a warg in a Japing way, but I think there is truth in it.Forgotten or just never realized?  If Jon hadn't found the direwolves, I doubt any of the Stark children would have realized they were wargs.
2302	Naathi Prince	2013-05-20	Look at the context, 2 years is a very long time in a zombie apocalypse. Just saying.that statement literally makes no sense whatsoever
2303	Arrogant Bastard	2013-05-20	Is Coldhands necessary? I think they could just have Sam meet up with Bran and company and just leave Coldhands out, especially since I don't think it's even been revealed who or what he is as of the end of ADWD. Introducing him this season, or even next, when he won't actually do anything for the next two or three seasons seems like a waste.
2304	Bob the Fiddler	2013-05-20	Coldhands might be Redwyn, a ranger Samwell was reading about in chapter 6 of ACOK.
I think Coldhands might be too difficult to make in CGI as he rides a giant elk. I think the show will use the huge murder of crows to stand in for Coldhands.  But I hope I'm wrong. CH is a BAMF!
2305	mbuehner	2013-05-20	Does that change the fact the leaf still would not say "long ago" about someone who has died recently? Offhand or not, I'm not going to say someone who has been dead for a year or two died "long ago" nor is that exact wording necessary to get it across to Bran that Coldhands is safe.I'd say any amount of time counts as a long time for a dead body to be walking around.
2306	LordStoneheart	2013-05-20	I thought it was nearly incontrovertible that Coldhands can't be Benjen.
2307	Head of The Ned	2013-05-20	I can't wait to see him in one of these next two episodes. You can't just have all those ravens and no coldhands.
2308	Mulled Wino	2013-05-20	I thought it was nearly incontrovertible that Coldhands can't be Benjen.well, people love to make things up.For example- All the sudden, red doesnt mean red, because there's a chance that whatever character said red might be colorblind.
2309	WiDMNDBAMMD	2013-05-20	I can't wait to see him in one of these next two episodes. You can't just have all those ravens and no coldhands.they could've technically been sent by the 3 eyed raven directly though... not that I'm trying to help the writers come up with a way to cut Cold Hands....
2310	WTFSalami	2013-05-20	I've been waiting for Coldhands ever since he first came on the page. The aesthetics of the character alone, a figure all in black with a scarf around his face, two glowing blue eyes, a whole flock of ravens at his back riding a giant elk? 
Uh, fuck yeah that's necessary.
2311	baxter	2013-05-20	I thought he did not have blue eyes
2312	WTFSalami	2013-05-20	I thought he did not have blue eyesNah you're right he's got black eyes, I forgot about that. It's just that so much fan art has him with blue eyes I had forgot that he doesn't. Still that incredibly mysterious screen presence is a must, IMO.
2313	Prince of the North	2013-05-20	The question is, imo, not who coldhands was, but why did he retained self-awareness. Other wights retain only some memories, for sure, but are slow and unintelligent.CH seems to be free willed and move as fast as a living being.

Don't think he is someone knowledgeable, and if he is Ben Stark, think he had tried to interact with Bran. Well, they were no shown to be close in the book and he could be reluctant to show to a relative what monster he became.You're right - those are the questions.  I have always believed that Coldhands is Benjen who was resurrected by the Three-Eyed Crow in the same way as Donderrion and Stoneheart (remember, Bloodraven was "rumored" to be a sorceror /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' /> ) in order to send him to protect Bran and bring Bran to him.  It explains his seeming autonomy.  Him being dead in the frozen north would mean his extremeties would quickly turn black so that explains his hands.  I also believe you are right when you say that it is not Coldhands skinchanging the ravens and elk - it is the TEC doing that to aid them.  Finally, the idea that because Leaf happens to be long-lived she absolutely must have meant tens, hundreds, or thousands of years ago when she said "they killed him long ago" of Coldhands is just as big of an assumption as anything else.  It's not nearly the "smoking gun" absolute proof that people make it out to be /idea.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':idea:' />ETA: Also, I disagree with you that Coldhands killed the NW deserters for no reason.  Not only were they deserters who had murdered their Lord Commander but, more importantly, they were a danger to getting Bran to the TEC.  I think they were tracking them.  Also, the meat from that "sow" Coldhands found was quite welcome to the starving kids /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />

2314	Weeping Sore	2013-05-20	There are a million ways to say "this person is dead" without saying "this person has been dead for a long time". Leaf did the second. Ergo, Coldhands has been dead for a long time. Saying words are wind is just a silly way of admitting the text does not support your thesis.But Leaf didn't say "he has been dead a long time." When Bran expresses concern that the wights might kill Coldhands, Leaf says "They killed him long ago." So you're saying they killed him 8000 years ago, the last time the Others rose? Wouldn't his black garb have long since rotted away? Or do you think they killed him sometime during the "current" rising of the Others, in the last couple of years? In which case it coul easily be Benjen.It's just more fitting to Leaf's archaic diction to have him say "They killed him long ago" rather than "They killed him already". It's a stylistic choice. Benjen.
2315	Arjuous	2013-05-20	I have to join the chorus of posters saying that "long ago means long ago."  I love theories as much as the next guy, and I miss Benjen, but "long ago" just flat out cannot logically translate to 2 years.  You're putting your fingers in your ears at this point.
2316	Prince of the North	2013-05-20	I have to join the chorus of posters saying that "long ago means long ago."  I love theories as much as the next guy, and I miss Benjen, but "long ago" just flat out cannot logically translate to 2 years.  You're putting your fingers in your ears at this point.Nah, I'm just acknowledging that the idea that because Leaf is long-lived she absolutely must have meant longer than a few years ago when she said "they killed him long ago" about Coldhands is just as much of an assumption as anything else at his point - that's all /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
2317	Weeping Sore	2013-05-20	I have to join the chorus of posters saying that "long ago means long ago."  I love theories as much as the next guy, and I miss Benjen, but "long ago" just flat out cannot logically translate to 2 years.  You're putting your fingers in your ears at this point.So you're going with 8000 years old? Because Leaf is saying the wights killed him, and they are a recent phenomenon unless you go back to the last rising of the others. That's fine, he's an 8000 year old wight who likes to raid NW corpses for new clothes.
2318	Bob the Fiddler	2013-05-20	I'm not sure that he's got the blue eyes because he's not an "other" affiliated wight.  He's like a free agent wight that plays for Blood Raven.
2319	Arjuous	2013-05-20	So you're going with 8000 years old? Because Leaf is saying the wights killed him, and they are a recent phenomenon unless you go back to the last rising of the others. That's fine, he's an 8000 year old wight who likes to raid NW corpses for new clothes.No, I'm going with "he died more than 2 years ago."  I don't know if he's the NK, he could just as easily be someone else, but I do know that the context of the statement concerning his age is incredibly difficult to stretch to meaning two years.
2320	Prince of the North	2013-05-20	No, I'm going with "he died more than 2 years ago."  I don't know if he's the NK, he could just as easily be someone else, but I do know that the context of the statement concerning his age is incredibly difficult to stretch to meaning two years.Honest question - why?  Because Leaf is long-lived, old?  You mention context.  We can only speculate about what the context even is, what exactly Leaf meant.  In reality, we won't know until Martin tells us.  Until then speculation and theorizing is all there is and, of course, we all think we're right.

2321	The Anti-Targ	2013-05-20	I'm going with not Benjen. Benjen is dead that's all, IMO. He was a plot device to get Mormont off his arse and go ranging beyond the Wall in force. He's served his purpose so is no longer needed at all in the story. Hopefully killed and burned by wildlings, or found dead then burned by wildlings so he's not a wight.
To that end the exact identify of Coldhands is unimportant, as he's effectively an empty vessel being warg controlled. But I'd like to see him in E 10, otherwise there's basically no need for us to see Sam and Gilly again until next season.
I do wish Sam had kept the dragonglass blade so he could stab the attacking wight, it breaks and have nothing happens. A much better final use of that weapon than leaving it in the snow.
2322	Arjuous	2013-05-20	Honest question - why?  Because Leaf is long-lived, old?  You mention context.  We can only speculate about what the context even is, what exactly Leaf meant.  In reality, we won't know until Martin tells us.  Until then speculation and theorizing is all there is and, of course, we all think we're right.I agree, this is wholly speculation, and all for good fun /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />.  But the theory put forward is that Coldhands is Benjen.  My objection to that theory, at least one of them, is admittedly subjective.  It is based on my interpretation of Leaf's account of when he died.  My interpretation of anyone saying something happened "long ago" in any context, but especially here where the individual saying it has a lifespan that dwarfs the norm, is that it very likely refers to a large amount of time.  More to the point, I just can't reconcile that wording with your thesis that the death happened 2 years ago.  "He already died" or something to that effect would have sufficed, however, he said "long ago," and to me that casts serious doubt on the Benjen thesis.And as an additional point, if Coldhands is/was Benjen, what harm would come from Leaf just telling Bran who he is? Or Bloodraven?  Bran is on the precipice of being able to see back in time, which would presumably answer this question anyway.  Granted, perhaps he is not ready, perhaps they didn't want to cloud his mind with such a personal revelation.  But still, if it was Benjen, that was as perfect a time as any to reveal it.I love the idea behind the theory, and if you're right I love how it works in terms of the story, but as it stands now I think there is more evidence against it than for it, and as such must respectfully disagree. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
2323	TheDarkOne	2013-05-21	It would be interesting to define what the parameters for "long ago" needs to be.
2324	Weeping Sore	2013-05-21	No, I'm going with "he died more than 2 years ago."  I don't know if he's the NK, he could just as easily be someone else, but I do know that the context of the statement concerning his age is incredibly difficult to stretch to meaning two years.I'm sorry, but you're refusing to engage with the point. The quote is "They (the wights) killed him long ago." So how long have the wights been around if it's more than two years? All through the nine-year summer?
2325	Khal Porno	2013-05-21	Why do people think Coldhands is Benjen?? Wouldn't Bran recognize him? And the timeframe doesn't line up.  This is a theory that doesn't make sense to me.
2326	Leto	2013-05-21	Why do people think Coldhands is Benjen?? Wouldn't Bran recognize him? And the timeframe doesn't line up.  This is a theory that doesn't make sense to me.Perhaps he would, perhaps he wouldn't. How doesn' the timeframe add up? bejen disappears, after this we don't know what/where he is. much later Bran meets coldhands.pros: Benjen disappers, coldhands is a possible explanation as to what happened to him. -facts noneCons: Remark by Leaf, possible recognition from Bran. -facts noneThere is no proof either way, so one would think it's a good topic for speculation on this forum.

I'm pretty sure they'll realize he's different when he's cutting through swaths of blue-eyed wights.

2331	Weeping Sore	2013-05-21	Why would that fry their brains any more than when we first read about him in the book? I'm pretty sure they'll realize he's different when he's cutting through swaths of blue-eyed wights.I'm not even sure the Wight/ White Walker distinction is clear enough for the non-readers at this point.  I've seen: "Sam kills an ice-zombie. We already knew you could burn them, now we know an obsidian blade makes them shatter." on the AV club "newbies" recap.Still, I think Coldhands seems different enough because, you know, he talks, has a flock of ravens, and helps out.  (I doubt we'll see him riding the giant stag for budgetary reasons, though /frown5.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':frown5:' />)
2332	Lord Paolo Stark	2013-05-21	They won't need to cast an actor so far for Coldhands, his face is hidden, the problem would be the voice though

(I doubt we'll see him riding the giant stag for budgetary reasons, though /frown5.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':frown5:' />)Yes, I believe Coldhands is different.  He's not a "good" wight or an Other.  I think he's someone (my money's on Benjen) who was killed in the frozen north and, thus, his body suffered some of what would naturally happen to a dead body in the cold.  Coldhands even says so himself when Bran asks him why his hands are black, etc.?  Coldhands says something like "when the heart stops, the blood congeals".  I think Coldhands was resurrected like Donderrion and Stoneheart by Bloodraven with the express purpose of having him find Bran and bringing him to the cave.
2334	Weeping Sore	2013-05-21	I'm going with not Benjen. Benjen is dead that's all, IMO. He was a plot device to get Mormont off his arse and go ranging beyond the Wall in force.

A much better final use of that weapon than leaving it in the snow.I agree that having the dragonglass blade break off in a wight would help underscore for viewers the difference between the White Walkers (ice made flesh/ Craster's sons all growed up?) and the wights (reanimated corpses serving the WW)Also, you're right that Coldhands is ultimately a separate character from Benjen, no matter who he used to be.  Just as Lady Stoneheart is not really Catelyn and Ser Robert Strong is not really Gregor Clegane.  Who Coldhands was in life is really backstory, and Coldhands should have more "screen-time" than Benjen ever did.That said, the preponderance of hints suggest that Coldhands used to be Benjen, while the case against him consists of two words- "long ago".
2335	WTFSalami	2013-05-21	its been a while since i read about him in the books forgive me if my memorys letting me down, i thought he just turned up got sam & gilly on the elk and rode away? i didn't remember him 'cutting through swaths of blue-eyed wights' but the point is still valid, why is a wight helping them when so far the wights have been the bad guys? its one of the mysterys of the books and i while all readers brains are fried we have all the foreshadowing stuff to give us some insight in to him and the non-readers dont have anything like that and are used to things being a bit 'dumbed down'What foreshadowing was there in the books of Coldhands? I'm really confused about your impression of this character. In the book he shows up out of nowhere in the midst of a flock of ravens riding a giant elk and pulls Sam and Gilly up and rides off away from all the wights. His face is covered accept for his black eyes. And Coldhands is cutting through swaths of wights as Bran and the Reeds reach the cave of the Children.

2337	Weeping Sore	2013-05-21	THEY MUST NOT CUT THE GIANT ELK.The problem with the elk is they're riding it the whole time.  Cut to Coldhands scene- there's somebody riding the elk.  It's not like the direwolves that disappear hunting for long stretches, that elk is always there! But I dunno, maybe they have to suck it up and pay for it now that show Bran is too big for Hodor to carry.  That cart's not going to cut it north of the Wall.

it was one of my favourite pieces of television ever. which is probably why i sometimes get very annoyed with the show because at times it is fucking GENIUS television. it has so much potential to be one of ''the greats' but this season, whilst having some of the best scenes in the series, as a whole, is making me worried game of thrones will just turn into generic fantasy fluff.
i hope not, may they prove my fears wrong!!

But I dunno, maybe they have to suck it up and pay for it now that show Bran is too big for Hodor to carry.  That cart's not going to cut it north of the Wall.I agree.  They will most likely have to leave out the skinchanged elk (I don't believe it's Coldhands skinchanging the elk and ravens - I think it's the TEC).  I recently re-read the Bran chapters in ADWD and it struck me again just how brutal it is simply to survive north of the Wall now.  I mean, there's hardly any food/prey available any more and that's to say nothing of the killingly cold temperatures and incredibly deep snow making travel almost impossible.  The elk was just about the only thing that could both carry the weight of some of the kids and traverse the deep, deep snow.  Also, when it finally gave out and died it provided some much needed sustenance to the kids.  Without that (and the "sow" meat that Coldhands provided) they would never have made it to the cave.  That's why I get a kick out of the theories that Benjen is still alive, is travelling ever northward, and that will be how we'll see the Heart of Winter or whatever.
2350	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-21	Couldn't they have the Elk for 2 or 3 eps before it dies then? I dunno...I always loved the gigantic Elk.

Benjen is Coldhands!Do we definitely know that Coldhands used to be Benjen? No. But...1. Two rangers from his party were found as blue-eyes corpses, both burned by the NW, one came back to life as a wight. We agree that Coldhands seems to be some kind of wight either controlled by a different power, or resurrected by a different force.2. Coldhands is referred to multiple times as a "ranger". Benjen was obviously First Ranger. Coldhands wears a black cloak, boiled leather and ringmail, i.e. dressed as a NW ranger. 3. He wears a hood shadowing his face and a black scarf over his mouth, "muffling his voice". It would be difficult for Bran to recognize him. It also begs the question how much time Bran spent with Benjen in life. My guess is not much, with Benjen at the Wall, coming back for the occasion of the King's visit. Nevertheless, Coldhands seems to regard Bran with a certain "warmth" or familiarity. "I am your monster Brandon Stark"4. Four separate times in ADwD, Jon takes time to wonder what happened to his uncle Benjen. Meanwhile, Coldhands is guiding Bran beyond the wall. It just seems like one of those hiding-in-plain-sight non-mysteries GRRM enjoys.

2362	chris999	2013-05-21	I'm anticipating that we're going to meet Coldhands in the coming episode (assuming they haven't cut him altogether, which would be a whole other thing). As far as I'm aware, there are two major theories on who Coldhands is. One is that he is the Night's King, a Lord Commander during the Age of Heroes who supposedly to an Other to wife and began to rule the Nights Watch like a king until being put down by both the King in the North and the King Beyond the Wall. The other is that he is in fact Benjen Stark.Although I am personally open to both theories, this post assumes that Coldhands is in fact Jon's uncle, lost beyond the wall. If so, this will have posed something of a problem for the writers: we already know what Benjen looks like. They could through a cloth over most of his face, true, but the viewers probably haven't forgotten Benjen completely, and may still recognise his voice.The writers may have encountered a similar problem this season with Astran/Barristan, but given that the readers at least knew who Astran really was, decided to chop the knot and reveal his true identity immediately. For obvious reasons they can't do this with "Benjen".Unless its done carefully, either one of the two major theories mentioned above will be ruled out for the readership.Thoughts?I am one of the few that thinks that Coldhands is just... Coldhands.I really dont think there is anything special about him other than that the Three Eyed Crow can manipulate/Warg him.I am not certain if Benjen is dead or not, but I actually think that Benjen could turn out to be the Nightsking. Old Nan puts an emphasis on the original Nightsking possibly being a Stark, and I think that the reason that Benjen has not been found yet is because he is way deeper in the North than anybody else, and he may even be with the Others by now for all we know... e havent herd from him since the damn Others appeared to begin with...
2363	Weeping Sore	2013-05-21	3. They killed him long agoDissected this a little up-thread but I think it bears repeating:"They killed him..." In context "They" means the wights. Have the wights always existed? No, they are corpses animated by the Others (WW). I think we can assume that the Others have risen toward the end of the 9 year summer, that they have returned in the last few years. So unless he's referring to other wights created during the previous Long Night thousands of years earlier, "long ago" in this instance cannot mean more than a few years ago.
2364	Longspear Ryk	2013-05-21	I don't like jacking off with cold hands and agree its a problem, ohhh wait, wrong website, damn thread name!Underrated post.
2365	WiDMNDBAMMD	2013-05-22	Dissected this a little up-thread but I think it bears repeating:"They killed him..." In context "They" means the wights. Have the wights always existed?Yes the wights have always existed for the last 8,000 years. Sam found scrolls, books etc. very old that described them. Also I don't think we can say that "they" means the wights necessarily killed him. Sure if the White Walkers found him then he should've become a wight himself, but who is to say that the children of the forest can't combat their "spells" that make dead things come back to life in their service? I'm not going to get into it though.No, they are corpses animated by the Others (WW). I think we can assume that the Others have risen toward the end of the 9 year summer, that they have returned in the last few years.I agree they're animated by the Others and you can assume that the Others have risen toward the end of the 9th year of summer but I'm not going to assume that the Others were 100% sleeping and rose towards the end of the 9th year of summer, that's just silly thinking.The Others(WW) began returning in force towards the end of the long summer to drive the wildlings south, that I will agree on. They appeared very close to the wall in the prologue of the first book.but, Craster is sacrificing his sons to the Others(WW) and he tells Lord Commander Mormont that he has had 99 sons. I don't think there's any possible way that he's sacrificed all 99 of them in one year.He's been sacrificing them to the White Walkers for years and years, which means that they all weren't asleep.So unless he's referring to other wights created during the previous Long Night thousands of years earlier, "long ago" in this instance cannot mean more than a few years ago.Wrong.  For the reasons I stated above plus I'll give you another example. The 13th Lord Commander found a wight which would've been how long after the Long Night? 100 years? If we take 998 and divide it by 8,000 then we get 8 years for the average, so I'll assume it was 100+ years after the Long Night(since they say the wall had just been finished it's not hard to assume that it wasn't build in a day, neither was Rome)Wights don't die, they're already dead, they don't die when WW go to sleep or are killed either apparently so saying that they're only created during the Long Night or just now is silly.Why do you think that the wildlings burn their dead? If no wights existed for 8,000 years do you think they'd really keep that tradition to prevent wights from coming into the world? No. I think it would be forgotten, but north of the wall there's a constant threat of dead becoming wights, there always has been a slight chance but the threat grows stronger now as the long summer ends and don't forget that Mace might've released a bunch more because he was looking for the horn of Jormund.

Which fits better with long ago (which is being used by a COTF which are very long lived.) than a couple of years.

Bran & co. have only just made it past the wights to the safety of the CotF cave, with Coldhands still outside battling the wights. Bran asks:"The ranger...""He cannot come.""They'll kill him.""No. They killed him long ago."As far as Wildling burial practices, traditions often continue long after their original purpose is forgotten. Burning would be more practical than trying to bury someone in frozen ground.Your point about Craster is a good one. Assuming he didn't just start leaving his infant sons out to die of exposure to eliminate future rivals, the WW must have been active in some capacity for a generation. However ancient Coldhands is or isn't, his clothes- boiled leather, ring mail, black cloak, & black scarf appear to be contemporary, not mouldering to dust, rotted or rusted. So if he's ancient he got himself some new clothes at some point.I'm looking forward to seeing him on the show, whoever he is.

"But at the end of season two we saw them about to attack the Night's Watch". I think this might hurt the show in the long run because it seems to matter a lot to those friends, and I'm wondering if maybe after another season or two of "Oooo, the WW are about to attack, but not just yet", people might get bored of buildup and switch off?In the same way that people ask me when does Daenerys get to Westeros and trying to explain that after five books she's still not done it, but the show's not hyping that nearly as much as the White Walkers attacking the NW.

2378	Ruka	2013-05-30	I think Long ago also means Long ago. look at today's perspective, long ago isn't people that died in Iraq, Long ago is more people that died in  WWII there are just a miniscule handful of them around.That is just the view of Americans, Europe thinks we are just a bunch of whippersnappers, put that into the perspective of a being that can recall hundreds of years in their own right. Long ago means not this decade.

2380	protar	2013-06-02	What if they use Ghost instead of coldhands?That doesn't make any sense. Unless they make BR in control of Ghost which...why would they do that?
2381	Leif	2013-06-02	Well, since they've already changed Sam's encounter with the Other I don't see why they can't postpone Coldhand's part. But since we know nothing about his appearance other than his eye-color they can cast just about anyone. Even the actor who played Benjen could play Coldhands, as long as he changes his voice. As for the theory, I'm more inclined to believe that he's the Night's King, rather than Benjen.
2382	Ska<U+0082>i	2013-06-28	You're right - those are the questions.  I have always believed that Coldhands is Benjen who was resurrected by the Three-Eyed Crow in the same way as Donderrion and Stoneheart (remember, Bloodraven was "rumored" to be a sorceror /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' /> ) in order to send him to protect Bran and bring Bran to him.  It explains his seeming autonomy.  Him being dead in the frozen north would mean his extremeties would quickly turn black so that explains his hands.  I also believe you are right when you say that it is not Coldhands skinchanging the ravens and elk - it is the TEC doing that to aid them.  Finally, the idea that because Leaf happens to be long-lived she absolutely must have meant tens, hundreds, or thousands of years ago when she said "they killed him long ago" of Coldhands is just as big of an assumption as anything else.  It's not nearly the "smoking gun" absolute proof that people make it out to be /idea.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':idea:' />ETA: Also, I disagree with you that Coldhands killed the NW deserters for no reason.  Not only were they deserters who had murdered their Lord Commander but, more importantly, they were a danger to getting Bran to the TEC.  I think they were tracking them.  Also, the meat from that "sow" Coldhands found was quite welcome to the starving kids /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />I agree with all of this. I'm surprised that the words "long ago" are interpreted with such certainty when they are quite vague.
2383	LordStoneheart	2013-06-29	I agree with all of this. I'm surprised that the words "long ago" are interpreted with such certainty when they are quite vague.She also says that the three-eyed-crow lived "beyond a mortal span." which means she knows her sense of time. This assuming BR=TEC, though I don't think there is any doubt about that. There's no reason to believe "long ago" is actually the children of the forests' code for "he was killed about two and half years ago."
2384	Katydid	2013-05-19	Thought he was PERFECT.  As they got with Tom Wlaschiha as Jaqen, this guy seems to have stepped right out of the pages.Despite the lack of wacky, multi-colored hair.  /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />

2386	tito5601	2013-05-19	yea i found him pretty cool i can see jorah going against him already
2387	WinterWarrior	2013-05-19	Total hottie. And an actor young enough to fit with Dany's youth. I think he is perfect. I am glad he will be around for awhile, eye candy for us ladies.
2388	TheGreenBell	2013-05-19	may be different from the book but I think he's perfect for the role.
2389	BendTheKnee610	2013-05-19	I'd say the differences of show-Daario from the book's version are a blessing.
2390	Garlan Marius	2013-05-19	Taking the gold tooth, blue hair, and goofy beard away and replacing him with a classically attractive man was a great decision.
2391	Naathi Prince	2013-05-19	There was no way they were going to make show-Daario have the blue hair or the golden tooth, although they did keep the naked lady stiletto and arakh.

2396	Katydid	2013-05-19	There was no way they were going to make show-Daario have the blue hair or the golden tooth, although they did keep the naked lady stiletto and arakh.That was a nice touch, the naked lady thingy.  The blue hair would have looked ridiculous on-screen, but just as they managed to pull off Jaqen's half & half hair in a subtle way, I thought they might try the same thing w/Daario.  Glad they didn't, he looked delicious perfect!

2406	mafalda	2013-05-19	He's delicious. Ok, ok, and a good actor. I do miss his multi colored hair and my biggest complaint about this season is that the people of Essos (Essonians?) don't look like what they're supposed to. They're not ethnic, they don't have their unique stylings and crazy wardrobes. None of it. They all look like Westerosis in a tokar.
I'm watching it again, and Darrio's on. Later.
2407	tallTale	2013-05-19	Dany's story arc has quickly turned into bad romance novel fodder.
2408	Lord Damian	2013-05-19	idk man I would do book Daario too.And tv Jorah, probably.book Daario too? wow.
2409	TheBastardofBluegrass	2013-05-19	Meh...He looks like a douche, and in the book he's written as a douche, so yeah, pretty good match I guess
2410	Jojosh	2013-05-19	Book daario is like a bum though they basically made this guy a lady killer
show dany has good taste
book dany is in love with a man with gold teeth

2413	wolverine	2013-05-19	I actually fear I might start to like Daario.Agreed.  I thought he was much more believable and awesome than book Daario.
2414	Ser Farbod	2013-05-19	I liked the nastiness of Book Daario, but I thought his look was cheesy (Gold tooth, really?).  I also wish he didnt wear armor.  I liked that bravado in the book.
2415	JonCon's Red Beard	2013-05-19	I can't lie. I think Ian Glen is way more attractive.
2416	shiola	2013-05-19	Even the forum is listing Daario as "hot"...
2417	Jojosh	2013-05-19	It makes more sense though this is the type of guy you could see dany passing up on show jorah for
2418	Lady Lea	2013-05-19	book Daario too? wow.what can I say /dunno.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':dunno:' />  lolIt makes more sense though this is the type of guy you could see dany passing up on show jorah foryep, after they cast that guy as Jorah they really had to step it up with Daario
2419	Lord Paolo Stark	2013-05-19	lack of beard and colors
but ok to me
well, with this we can be pretty sure there won't be Storm Crows
2420	Queen Elsa	2013-05-19	Now I can see Jorah saying, "Do not trust him, Khaleesi."

2422	Ser Farbod	2013-05-19	well, with this we can be pretty sure there won't be Storm CrowsA lot of non readers are confused already.  They are simplifying a lot in order to keep a semblance of organization on the show.  I just don't know how they will fix the BBP problem now that the second sons are led by Daario.
2423	freetickles	2013-05-19	Disagree. This guy is rubbing me the wrong way. I actually like Daario's confident swagger in the books. This guy is just creeping me out with that smile.
2424	go joff go	2013-05-19	Still want to punch him, but It feels like we are going to benefit from not being in Dany's head when it comes to Daario.
2425	ugashep	2013-05-19	Daario in the books has some swagger in his personality, it was just always tough to take him seriously the way he was described. In the world of ice and fire people would grow up knowing Tyroshi dyed their hair blue but in our world its just weird. The way show Daario looks it is a little easier to understand Dany's decisions.
2426	Zman1863	2013-05-19	I think there has to be a bit or more for us to disapprove of about Daario. Her relationship with him is a sort of adolescent dream that ignores realities. Her attraction to him must be in some ways incomprehensible. But I do approve of the toned down more conventional look.
2427	Winterz	2013-05-19	I have to agree with most here. Great portrayal. So far I'm enjoying !Show Daario.
2428	cybobbie	2013-05-19	I agree with the comments here, I really like that they toned him down for the show, because the book characteristics would seem quite ridiculous on screen and it would be hard to see Danny falling for him.
2429	int11	2013-05-19	I don't remember much of Dany's first meetings with Daario, so I was hoping someone could help me out.Didn't Dany get The Second Sons drunk before she attacked them in the night? If so, can this or something similar happen in the show before Yunkai is attacked?

2431	Magic 8 Ball	2013-05-19	Toning down his appearance goes a long way towards making the character more palatable, I have to admit.
He's also getting a lot more "nice guy underneath the swagger" treatment which helps as well.
2432	Lord Damian	2013-05-19	Keep in mind, this guy's character. He is like brothers with his co- captains than he slits their throats (the book implies he does it in the middle of the night when they are sleeping) then presents them to Dany as he is some great warror. This guy cannot be trusted. But heh, if he is eye candy for the ladies it gives the show more ratings and that makes it more probable that HBO will keep producing the books into series. Go Daario, Go!!!

you mean taking away every single physical attributes that clearly distinct daario from anyone else is a good thing? I can understand the blue hair part, but the tooth also? and the beard? idk if its just women automatically accepting him because of the eye candy factor but cmon, dude looks nothing like book daario.
I was also expecting a much larger guy as daario but whatever, atleast the actor is playing his part very well.
just wish they would of atleast kept some sort of book daario to his appearance..

2435	HouseHarrison	2013-05-19	Actually making him seem attractive by modern standards without having him lose any of his masculinity was a good touch. He is doing a good job portraying the role.

2440	TheAwesomeVargoHoat	2013-05-19	TV Daario had about 3 minutes of screen time, I'm not sure how it's possible to say he's better than book Daario other than looking differently.  And I liked the book look better, show Daario just looks typical, there is nothing special about him, just an average guy.
2441	Bastard of Boston	2013-05-19	Just a thought. What if the toned down initial appearance of Daario is a calculated attempt to introduce the blue hair later? When you bust out the gate with something ridiculous, the audience is naturally going to squirm. Let them know Daario a little bit, and maybe after a few episodes, seeing him reveal blue locks won't be as jarring because the audience will be accustomed to him.
I don't know. Something tells me that D&D will find a way to introduce the blue hair at some point...whether it's a single scene or a casual mention. Just keep in mind that the blue hair is dyed. Just because it isn't dyed now doesn't mean it can't be dyed later.
It doesn't even need to be "shitshock" blue. I see women walking around with black hair, which has hints of purple. Something like that for Daario could work.
Regardless, I don't mind what they've done with him on the show.

2442	Prince of Dragonstone	2013-05-19	This version is a definite improvement on Book!Daario. Also we must realize that a major problem with Book!Daario is that we're only privy to him through Dany's teenage schoolgirl crushing mind. She is head over heels in lust with him like a tween going after Justin Bieber. The whole point of Daario's character in the books is to illustrate to the audience that Dany, for all her queenly regalia is still a young girl with girlish thoughts and desires. 
TV!Dany is much more likeable that Book!Dany as well. She is more "epic" than in the books and is much more mature, although because we're not privy to her inner thoughts we are spared some of her more insipid inner dialogue.
2443	Montey14	2013-05-19	The thing is....Dario is suposed to be flamboyant and arrogant .....maybe some blue hair and some sort of  facial hair would have been kewl.....bok Dario was supposed to be ravishingly handsome even with the crazy hair and beard....

And I liked the book look better, show Daario just looks typical, there is nothing special about him, just an average guy.Average? I'm a guy but im pretty certain that husbands and boyfriends who watch with their wives and girlfriends are going to be getting some after episodes that have him and dany together.I'd like to say that liking show Daario better doesn't mean I don't like the character in the books. The book Daario was great, I just found Dany's infatuation with him not very believable and it made me hate Dany a bit. With a hunky looking guy like this I still won't like it but it will be understandable.
2446	Cameron	2013-05-19	much better than the book version, in my opinion. bit more compelling character, glad they did away with the hair and tooth.
2447	Envie	2013-05-19	Daario's actor is anything but 'average' - he's a good looking man and interesting enough looking to make viewers like him more than book readers did and that is, I believe, the real reason they've decided to go with this version for the show. Many of us constantly wondered what Dany could possibly see in book Daario ... with his strange looks, swagger, attitude - it was a definite turn off for me as it seemed to be for many (not just female readers). I think HBO made the right choice changing Daario into something much more enticing for Dany. He's just managed to sneak into her private quarters, taker her hand maiden without a peep, present Dany with the heads of the two men she clearly despised and who insulted her at their meeting, and then give her the one thing she wanted in the first place - complete cooperation and support from the Second Sons. All of that AND he's good looking, confident and clearly very attracted to her too. When she got up out of that tub naked, and sauntered over to him, I was actually saying "YEAH DANY, GET SOME!" and I never said that in reading the books. Book Daario was far too skanky.
2448	Thor Odinson	2013-05-19	...but cmon, dude looks nothing like book daario....Thank God! I detested book Daario because of how stupid he looked. I couldn't buy someone looking that idiotic getting anywhere in the world.
2449	Jasta11	2013-05-19	Yeah, he seems rightly cast. Cocky and swaggering as he should be, but without the ridiculous peacock getup so you can actually take him seriously. I won't say I like him, but he's definitely not the eye-rolling worthy goofball he is in the books.
2450	Northern Sun	2013-05-19	Daario was probably the character I was least looking forward to being introduced, but I think the guy they cast was excellent for him. And the lack of multicolored hair is a welcome change.
2451	Tori Targaryen	2013-05-20	I think it's safe to say we can all breathe a sigh of relief concerning Daario in the series lol I was very pleased with the results. I can see Dany being interested in THIS Daario, the one in the book always had me scratching my head
2452	PhoenixFlame	2013-05-20	Damn Daario, you got an upgrade! He's interesting looking; I can see why Dany gets all hung up on him. And why Jorah is going to want to cut his cock off.
2453	andrew_	2013-05-20	Excellent interpretation of the character, much more believable in the sense of the series, but if he killed the titans bastard, we won't get that awesome scene with Barristan killing him /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />

Her attraction to him must be in some ways incomprehensible. But I do approve of the toned down more conventional look.I disagree completely. I think that book Dany is attracted to Daario because she has a nature in common with him that she has been repressing. Her adolescent dream that ignores reality is that she can be a just and benevolent engine of change; that she can eliminate injustice from the world, solve everyone's problems and make everyone love her for it. Daario represents the reality that to be powerful you must be ruthless and harden your heart. You can't be concerned with petty, naive dreams of justice and morality, you just have to dominate those who would oppose you and force your change. I was much more disappointed that she didn't yet follow her desires to be with Daario and accept his philosophy, because that is what is in her nature. Fire and Blood, my friend, Fire and Blood.

2460	Tirilei	2013-05-20	He comes across like a comic book character to me. A face like a plastic doll. Not attractive at all, just weird.

When he was not Daario, but a trash talking fool who gets killed in one episode, I was very disappoint.
2466	TomBadgerlock	2013-05-20	I quite liked both Mero and Daario. Also was pleased to see that they included Dany's "I am just a girl and know nothing of the ways of war" line.
2467	Bayard	2013-05-20	I remember him doing some not so nice things but I don't remember him being bad? idkHe proposed to Dany to use her wedding to kill all the noble families in Meereen and conquer their pyramids. So, he's the Walder Frey of Essos.
2468	The Scabbard Of the Morning	2013-05-20	I will not lie, hated the Dario in the books, but I like this one. At least in this one I can understand why Dany would be attracted to him.  In the books he was a blue haired clown.
2469	amilas	2013-05-20	My first thought was said outloud "NO!!! THIS IS ALL WRONG!" but then he smiled and I realized (and this is soooo shallow) that he is absolutely gorgeous. I'm usually not such a fangirl, but damn! That boy is pretty.
I guess in this sense I kind of like him better. I was always confused in the book why Dany was attracted to him. Dyed, forked beards are just not my style. But I can understand it a little better here. Still, I'm totally ashamed by how I'm okay with this character based on how pretty he is. I know I should hate this major change. Help me!
2470	The Mondrian Oak	2013-05-20	The guy totally reminds me of Drogo. He's like a wanker Drogo. A "Jersey Shore" Drogo. No wonder Dany falls for him. Is there anything the casting department of this show can do wrong?
2471	Tirilei	2013-05-20	Can't believe so many find his plastic features good looking. Too bad they didn't switch this actor with Grey Worm. And I'm just talking from a non-reader's perspective.
2472	ThePrinceOfSunspear	2013-05-20	Uhh Mero was hotter than Daarioo...thats a PROBLEM folks....
Lol I don't know what yall were smoking but Daario looked ugly to me. Even Stannis looked better and he's OLDER and has gray hair.
2473	ohpooratlas	2013-05-20	I like him so far.
Still kind of sad we don't get the blue hair.  His rediculous appearance helped to really empathize the sleeziness of his character.
I have a feeling they are going to water him down for the show to make him more appealing for viewers to ship with Dany.
2474	RedChick	2013-05-20	I don't find Daario all that attractive either. He's too, IDK, generic looking for me. Blah! Whatever, I guess he's just not my type.
As a character? Can't say, a little to early for me but he is pretty likable so far.
2475	Sun and Moon	2013-05-20	It is just me, or did anyone else get a bit of a flashback to Arya's first conversation with Jaqen H'ghar?
Firstly, Daario told her, "Don't scream, lovely girl."
And then, "I'm Daario Naharis, I always have a choice."
Lovely girl? Hmmmm... and all the talk of choices (Arya: "I didn't have a choice" Jaqen: "You did, I did... and here we are.")I'm seriously wondering whether any of my unsullied friends are coming up with a "Daario is really a Faceless Man" theory.
2476	Lady Pumpkinhead	2013-05-20	Now, the "bad guy" that arrogant dirty talking captain with a scar on his face, that guy was interesting and attractive. Had to die, yes. I could have gone for a little torture of that guy, maybe some girl torture by Missandei.I agree! At first I thought that dude would play Daario, and I was like "daaaaaaaammmmmmnnnnn!!!" Those piercing blue eyes sucked me in! (Until he opened his mouth of course.) I was like "Who's the lady over on the right?" And "What's up with Fabio over here?" Oh well, I took a liking to TV!Daario in the bath scene. I can see how Dany finds him attractive. And damn, am I glad he doesn't have any gold teeth. That shit was ridiculous.
2477	Jojosh	2013-05-20	book Daario looking distinct from everyone else and dany's unfortunate attraction to him are all his character has in the books
at least show daario has a bit more going for him than looking and acting like a sleeze
2478	kkae	2013-05-20	I'm really disappointed with tv-Daario.
As much as I dislike the book-Daario, I already hate tv one more.
2479	Lucifer Lightbringer	2013-05-20	Naw you guys just don't get Daario man. That dude is for real.
2480	Nezzer	2013-05-20	"They told me I had no choice. I told them I am Daario Naharis, I always have a choice"This line is right there with Darkstar's "I am of the night" as one of the worst attempts of badassery in the story. Very in-character for Daario though.Perfect delivery and perfect smug face. It made me instantly hate him.

2481	Master Forel's Fro	2013-05-20	At least he has his naked lady knife once he starts fondling them, there's gonna be a floodgate around here.
2482	RedChick	2013-05-20	I agree! At first I thought that dude would play Daario, and I was like "daaaaaaaammmmmmnnnnn!!!" Those piercing blue eyes sucked me in! (Until he opened his mouth of course.) I was like "Who's the lady over on the right?" And "What's up with Fabio over here?"LOL I found the guy playing Mero much more easy on the eyes as well. I didn't even notice the others in the scene at first. But of course once he opened his mouth and said those rather crude comments his hotness sorta diminished for me. Shame that he got killed so early though.
2483	SoooTrypticon	2013-05-20	I found Mero much more physically attractive too. Daario looks like a bad romance novel illustration. He's also pretty pervy looking too. His smile is creepy, and it bugged me that he was checking out Dany like a piece of meat.
It wasn't really flirty, and kinda felt gross. Dany's been so strong this season, it was a real bummer to see Daario included. Just a reminder of lame things to come.
I really hope Daario ends up being the Harpy, and Dany charbroils him.
2484	rumple9	2013-05-20	he looks like Legolas ......
2485	nubreed000	2013-05-20	I honestly thought he was way too much of a pretty boy. Ditch the long hair, Fabio
2486	Master Forel's Fro	2013-05-20	He's hot till he opens his mouth with his horse teeth.
2487	David Selig	2013-05-20	This guy is awesome. I love his swagger.
 No blue forked beard was obviously the right call.
2488	cade	2013-05-20	Fully relate to the desire for eye candy but I try not to extend that to criticizing someone for having unusual fashion sense, nor criticizing someone else for being attracted to it. Eye of the beholder & all that. Personality-wise, yes, there's a lot to legitimately criticize about Daario (as Dany herself does in the books), but most of the criticism, as this thread exemplifies, is directed at his appearance. Makes me regret that D&D caved, even though I admit to personally preferring their choice.
2489	teemo	2013-05-20	The guy totally reminds me of Drogo. He's like a wanker Drogo. A "Jersey Shore" Drogo. No wonder Dany falls for him. Is there anything the casting department of this show can do wrong?this. he's good for the role.and fwiw i'm not attracted to him. I'm not going to be mean, but no, not my type.

2490	trearu	2013-05-20	Since we can not see inside Deny in the TV-show, it seemed obvious they would make him look more stereotypical attractive.
But I still doubt they can properly show why Deny is so totally fascinated with him. I think they really missed an opportunity by not recasting the Drogo actor. I really miss that guy.

2491	boojam	2013-05-20	He's delicious. Ok, ok, and a good actor. I do miss his multi colored hair and my biggest complaint about this season is that the people of Essos (Essonians?) don't look like what they're supposed to. They're not ethnic, they don't have their unique stylings and crazy wardrobes. None of it. They all look like Westerosis in a tokar.I'm watching it again, and Darrio's on. Later.Every body take a stress pill and settle down.D&D have toned down all GRRM's  Essos embellishments , which seem to stem from George's sense of humor.It's gonna be this way from here on out.My guess is that when Gemma Jackson saw design concepts taken from the books she said "That gonna look silly visually."

2493	Mulled Wino	2013-05-20	I approved of the change.  Loved it, and we got naked Khaleesi!
2494	Mulled Wino	2013-05-20	I wonder if people complained about the lack of singular-breast covering dresses in Qarth last season?Right here.  I complained about it for sure.  Was looking forward to it for over a year.  But im over it after the bath scene.
2495	lannistergold	2013-05-20	If fate is kind, he could be the next Xaro: a shit character from the books who ends up cool on-screen. I don't want to get ahead of myself, but I was pleasantly surprised.
2496	MarieAntoinette	2013-05-20	I like show Daario already after one episode. I did not like book Daario, so this is an improvement.
2497	Demandred	2013-05-20	I was watching with my dad and as soon as the three leaders of the SS made their introductions, he just blurted out that Dany was gonna sleep with Daario later on. I was really taken aback. He's just a show viewer so there was no knowledge of the books. 
I like this adaptation of Daario. I always thought that the blue hair sounded stupid, haha.
2498	boojam	2013-05-20	I wonder if people complained about the lack of singular-breast covering dresses in Qarth last season?Some did. I think even D&D said it would be too distracting.
2499	Lord of Cheese	2013-05-20	I laughed pretty hard at Daario. He could have had a starring role in Zoolander. Not what i thought the personality type of book Daario was like. This guy is nearly comical.
Nevermind the blue beard being distracting... the teeth! the teeth!!!
2500	SerMixalot	2013-05-20	I wonder if people complained about the lack of singular-breast covering dresses in Qarth last season?me /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
2501	Hatting	2013-05-20	I think he was a pretty true adaption of the book Daario. 
I'm af more concern with Danys life. If sneaking into her camp was this easy it's pretty spectacular that she's still alive. 
In the book he was atleast captured as a spy.
2502	Reposado	2013-05-20	I was watching with my dad and as soon as the three leaders of the SS made their introductions, he just blurted out that Dany was gonna sleep with Daario later on. I was really taken aback. He's just a show viewer so there was no knowledge of the books.they kinda telegraphed it, imo. having him say his own name, was basically screaming, "this is an important character" then with all the gratuitous lookbacks, it was obvious why
2503	GoldenFleece	2013-05-20	It is interesting how subjective woman's ideals of beauty in a man are.  One my ex-girlfriends had a thing for Ron Perlman.
2504	Greywolf2375	2013-05-20	I'll be honest - I'm gonna miss the gold tooth and dyed hair.  The guy has the swagger and arrogance to pull of Daario, he's a peacock without the feathers now.  I like the casting, I think he is going to own the role, I'm just gonna miss the colors.
2505	SeventySeven	2013-05-20	The actor's delivery is very stilted. Mind you, I don't like Daario in the books and he ruins Dany's story for me a little, so it's not like I was ever that keen anyway. But the actor seems rather bad, too.
2506	Envie	2013-05-20	It is just me, or did anyone else get a bit of a flashback to Arya's first conversation with Jaqen H'ghar?Firstly, Daario told her, "Don't scream, lovely girl."And then, "I'm Daario Naharis, I always have a choice."Lovely girl?

2507	Queen Elsa	2013-05-20	Love reading all the Daario reactions. Too bad no blue hair, no three-forked beard, and no golden tooth to make fun with, but the show graciously keep those wanton sword hilts of his (a little consolation), so Dany can still say "WTH. I'm freakin' jealous."
Anyhoo, Dany supposed to have the super hots on Daario. Since Daario saw nekkid khalessi, me guess, he got the hots now. He should immerse himself next in that bath tub, it's currently available.
2508	Mr Hodor	2013-05-20	i hate Daario in the books and i hate him in the series, which might mean the actor fits in the role
2509	BorhPT	2013-05-20	I loved the fact he had naked women on his Arakh and dagger. And the acting was very good. He's already "The Bawss", finally something cool in Daenerys chapters, I've been finding them in lack of characters that thrill me
2510	ServantOnIce	2013-05-20	lol reading all these comments is kind of sad.you mean taking away every single physical attributes that clearly distinct daario from anyone else is a good thing? I can understand the blue hair part, but the tooth also? and the beard? idk if its just women automatically accepting him because of the eye candy factor but cmon, dude looks nothing like book daario.I was also expecting a much larger guy as daario but whatever, atleast the actor is playing his part very well.just wish they would of atleast kept some sort of book daario to his appearance..You can say that about every character on this show almost.Ygritte, too good looking, teeth too straightDinklage, too handsome, taller than TyrionLittlefinger, taller than he appearsAll the actors playing the kids are older than their book ages,Natalie Dormer way to sensual and old to be playing Madge TyrellLena Headey to skinny to play Queen CerseiEtc, etc,  . . ...    let it go.
2511	Mother of Mini Dragons	2013-05-20	The actor was great and I think he'll come across just as douchey as book Daario. Plus, he's better looking than I imagine book Daario, so there's that...
2512	Maester Totoro	2013-05-20	I actually didn't like this casting. Not an acting problem, but I think they cast him more based on Dany's opinion of him than on how he actually looks like. I always pictured Daario more similar to the actor playing Mero, a sleazy, greasy guy.
2513	lostinwesteros	2013-05-20	I found Mero much more physically attractive too. Daario looks like a bad romance novel illustration. He's also pretty pervy looking too. His smile is creepy, and it bugged me that he was checking out Dany like a piece of meat.It wasn't really flirty, and kinda felt gross. Dany's been so strong this season, it was a real bummer to see Daario included. Just a reminder of lame things to come.I really hope Daario ends up being the Harpy, and Dany charbroils him.I agree here.  At first I thought, yes, this a great improvement on Daario - I can like this guy.  But on second thought, that's not really the point of Daario.  He's a slime, and the tv casting will render that whole storyline nil.  I especially hated the way he was able to sneak into Dany's tent undetected...really?

2515	mrunderhill	2013-05-20	Opinion of a straight male: show Daario is a colossal improvement over that clown from the books.I agree with this. He also seems a much better warrior and does not display such wanton cruelty. Dany can fall for show Daario without people questioning her judgement. In fact Show Dany seems like the best hope for Westeros.
2516	Tquinn BC	2013-05-20	I hate Daario in the book.
And in the show
I hate his gold teeth and his colored beard
I hate Daario's existence
Anyone else?

I know that everyone said it will look silly. But, um, in the world today, there are cultures that do and wear certain things that we might consider silly, but that's just their way. It's the same thing for Tormund, they toned him way down because they didn't think all the "Hars!" and member talk would translate well on screen. But all they've done is strip these characters of who they are, what makes them, THEM. If they won't allow the Essonians to have their original wardrobe and antics, then at least have them be ethnic. This is the perfect chance to showcase people of different races on this show, because in the book they were described as ethnic... darker skin, almond shaped eyes, etc.. but so far all the actors in Essos (minus the slaves...) are all white. When Dany sacked Astapor, looking at all the people who came to see the dragon was a total wtf moment for me. They all looked Westerosi.But I know, I get what you're saying about the wardrobe and hair, but at least cast people from different backgrounds. Come on, D&D.

The gold tooth, the forked beard, the dyed hair...its too much, and it doesnt resemble any culture. It's just garish and cartoonish. Also, isnt Daario is white in the books?I can understand this complaint about a generally beloved and awesome character like Tormund, but...THIS IS FUCKING DAARIO, the shittiest character in the books! Second only to Darkstar! He's exactly the kind of character who should be changed!
2522	Jorah the Explorer	2013-05-20	Daario is my all time most hated fictional character in any book or movie so I'll try to look at the show character objectively.  Came across as a groaner and eye-roller, but not as heavily as book Daario.  I really like Emilia Daenerys, especially this season, and it's hard to picture her crumbling into loathsome Daenerys.  We'll see how it plays out.
2523	Tirilei	2013-05-20	Am I the only one thinking the casting director said, "Find me a young Brad Pitt?"This guy looks nothing like chubby-cheeks young Brad Pitt. More like a young Tarzan.
2524	Lord Paolo Stark	2013-05-20	I didn't like him, It would be nice to have some blue hair or at least a blue beard, he's a Tyroshi, he was supposed to be extravagant and he wasn't supposed to kill the Bastard of the Titan, Mero, Mero was supposed to attempt against Dany's life during the battle to take Yunkai, if I'm not mistaken

I said that it's silly for them to take away their identity because it comes off as silly, while in our world, there are cultures who do and wear stuff we might think comes off as silly.I also never said that Daario isn't white. Words. Mouth.I said that being in Essos is the perfect opportunity to include characters of different races because a lot of Essonians are described in an ethnic way. I never said Daario specifically.
2526	Queen Elsa	2013-05-20	Am I the only one thinking the casting director said, "Find me a young Brad Pitt?"They're supposed to find a younger Jack Sparrow.
2527	Tirilei	2013-05-20	but you're cool with Mero making blatant jabs at Dany and sniffing Missandei's vag and slapping her ass?Being physically attractive doesn't exclude being a jerk who behaves disgustingly. That's why it would have been nice to see him suffer for his arrogance. Any guy who makes that kind of a tongue jab at a woman deserves to have his tongue cut. By her.

Yet at the same time they will call Joffrey a monster for doing the same to the bard. A woman has a right to viciously chop a man up, but a man, who hits a woman is a monster right?
2531	Tirilei	2013-05-20	So, the third guy, that dark haired guy, wasn't that the same actor as the one who played Arya's faceless man in the goodbye scene?  When Jaqen turns to leave and then turns around with a different face.  The three coins from three different places, those were the three places these three guys were from, correct?
2532	Jamie Lannister	2013-05-20	I think it's an improvement. I admit, Daario's frankly ridiculous character design prejudiced me against him a little in the books, mostly since I cannot fathom what a smart girl like Dany would see in this guy. In addition to being a self-proclaimed backstabber, he was also looked ridiculous. Blue hair? A three-pronged beard dyed cobalt? A blue-and-gold mustache? What? That the most beautiful woman in the world (in-universe; that's not an exaggeration) would fall for him so hard is a tad bewildering. Now it's easier to understand. He's hot.

When Jaqen turns to leave and then turns around with a different face.

He's likable but dangerous, and not entirely trustworthy, and I find myself wanting to trust him, just as I want to trust book!Daario (but don't yet.)  Visually and personality-wise, it's easy for me to see why Dany will be attracted to, and wary of, him.Looks don't always have to be spot-on.  For instance, in the books, Syrio is bald.  The actor they got to portray him had thick, curly hair, and he was still (IMO) the perfect Syrio.
2538	Young Nan	2013-05-20	It is just me, or did anyone else get a bit of a flashback to Arya's first conversation with Jaqen H'ghar?Firstly, Daario told her, "Don't scream, lovely girl."And then, "I'm Daario Naharis, I always have a choice."Lovely girl? Hmmmm... and all the talk of choices (Arya: "I didn't have a choice" Jaqen: "You did, I did... and here we are.")I'm seriously wondering whether any of my unsullied friends are coming up with a "Daario is really a Faceless Man" theory.You aren't the only one.  I watched the episode with two unsullied, and they noticed immediately that he spoke similarly to Jaqen H'ghar, and also with the iron Braavosi coin + Valar Morghulis, they both were like "OMG he's totally a faceless man, isn't he?!"  and I was like "No, he's just a douchebag."    I know other people in the show have said Valar Morghulis before, but the association with the coin, and "lovely girl" seemed like they were hinting at it, I see where they came to that conclusion.  I doubt D&D are doing that, it would be really, really retarded to make Daario a FM, but sticking leeches to Gendry's penis is stupid too, so you never know.
2539	Young Nan	2013-05-20	Okay, I've put together the top "resemblance" contenders: Brad Pitt, Tarzan, and Jack Sparrow:http://www.anniemayh...oContenders.jpgDaario is, was, and always has been Jack Sparrow, to me.
2540	Master of Laws	2013-05-20	Daario's actor reminds me of Freddie Mercury.
2541	The_Gallows_Knight	2013-05-20	Boob Swords!
I like him, he has the swagger of bookDaario without the ridicolous hair. I kinda wished his choice of clothing had been more flamboyant thought, Mero's fashion sense was way flashier than Daario's.
2542	mediterraneo	2013-05-20	When I started looking back this series with my spanish girlfriend, she started complaining that people here are too much blonde. She calls show Bran blonde too, so i'm not sure up to what point is she right, but it is true. There are two continent of people that are basically WASP built, and book Starks were supposed to be black haired, excluding robb and sansa who took from their mother.
Before you eat me: I understand that the main target (live or die) of this tv show is the USA television public, and that the show has to live with this public meter of judice,  prejudice and expectations, which may be different but is equally valuable than my own set of meters of judice, prejudices and expectations.
But this (beautiful) Daario is less exotic than he should have been. He is less different from any northerner OR andal in the series than Sansa is different from herself when changing hairdress from the North to the capitol.
The TV show went with an easy understandable simplification  rather than spending money on thousands of extras' hair tint just to explain us that from where Daario comes, no handsome young man, nor any self respecting warrior, presents himself in public WITHOUT a blue hair.
I admit defeat, and understand that the show has limits on visual impact. Lys people were to be Valyrians, they are clearly not in the show: they work as well as they are, and I'll have to live up to this.
2543	total1402	2013-05-20	I am not surprised. I imagined they would try to present the character as a lot more sympathetic and likable. His appearance is a huge part of why I don't like him. It just makes no sense that a smart lass like Dany would fall shamelessly in love with Jedwoods pervy uncle.

the appendix of the asoiaf saga. clearly there for something, but right now, here for nothing. actually, never mind, that's all of meereen.
2545	shiola	2013-05-20	... book Starks were supposed to be black haired, excluding robb and sansa who took from their mother.Book Bran has Tully colouring as well.
2546	DragonsHungry	2013-05-20	I like the change to TV Daario, a good looking actor, charming, and seemed less annoying and clownish looking.  I fully support the de-jesterfication of Westeros.  The female viewers of the show deserve their eye candy the same as us guys.
2547	lunadangelo	2013-05-20	Unlike most, I really like book Daario. Aside from the blue hair, I understand why Dany falls for him. So to my surprise, I now find myself actually disliking show Daario. Where as I did not, like most, find Daario to be an arrogant douche bag, show Daario certainly is. 
I suppose those who have always viewed him that way are happy, but I am disappointed.
2548	The Killer Snark	2013-05-20	Agreed with the other supporters here. Changing the coloured hair and beard makes little difference. The characters in Essos in the series lack the weird hair colours and wacky hair and beards in the novels anyway. The purpose was only to bring in a character Dany could realistically have a sexual fixation on who comes across exactly like he does in the books. Even the body movements are the same. Of course, they could have made him just as ostentatiously dressed. And he's a good actor who appears to have an understanding of the books.
Also, book Daario actually is an arrogant douchebag; it's just that he has charm.

2549	Dove	2013-05-20	Daario down, Darkstar to go. Will he be of the night? Will he have ~super special~ two tone hair? Will he fail to kill an adolescent girl after being dubbed the most dangerous man in Dorne?? Only time will tell!I've never understood how Daario could be so hated with goddamn Darkstar around. Daario's worst crime was looking and dressing absolutely ridiculous, really, and the show's pretty much solved that one. People slam him for giving bad advice/being skeevy and shifty/being cocky and then turn around and love Bronn sooo (just sayin, i love bronn too)

People slam him for giving bad advice/being skeevy and shifty/being cocky and then turn around and love Bronn sooo (just sayin, i love bronn too)I think it's because Darkstar had the good grace to dissapear after one chapter, while Daario just keeps coming back, over, and over.With regards to Bronn, I think it's because he's actually funny, which Daario isnt.
2551	SteelAndSnow	2013-05-20	Well evidently this has divided the fandom down the centre. Here are my thoughts:
I'm absolutely cool with it. This is more realistic and relatable. It shows Dany's crush perfectly. The thing in the books was, we're seeing everything from Dany's POV. We know how she's feeling. That's why it wasn't after I'd read quite a few chapters that Daario started annoying me. You only really look at him much later (at least, I did). Having a guy who looks like BookDaario wouldn't have worked IMO because well.. he's freaking batshit crazy looking. This guy had all the swagger. And I wanted to smack him in the face as much as I want to smack BookDaario. So it has the same effect.
Though he does look like everybody else and like someone said above, isn't "exotic" enough. I wish they were making the people on this continent physically different from the Westerosi, not just putting them in different clothes.

2554	The Killer Snark	2013-05-20	The hair and beard colour wouldn't matter. As pointed out, Daario was instantly hated by Jorah because he was handsome in spite of the ridiculous affectations of his style. I'd have styled him to suit the novel but the casting is too acccurate for it to any more than a nit.

2555	Jasta11	2013-05-20	He's delicious. Ok, ok, and a good actor. I do miss his multi colored hair and my biggest complaint about this season is that the people of Essos (Essonians?) don't look like what they're supposed to. They're not ethnic, they don't have their unique stylings and crazy wardrobes. None of it. They all look like Westerosis in a tokar.I'm watching it again, and Darrio's on. Later.A good thing if you ask me. Essos in the book is a ridiculous sounding caricature, and Daario is the worst. Between all the obese whales, guys with blue pubic hair and dresses with one tit out, it was hard to take them seriously when Westeros felt far more believable. Show Essos actually seems like a real place, not a theme park version of Middle East-Asia cliches.
2556	Winter's Prince	2013-05-20	Dany is mine by rights. Any man who seeks to have her is my foe, including Daario. I hate him.
2557	Young Nan	2013-05-20	A good thing if you ask me. Essos in the book is a ridiculous sounding caricature, and Daario is the worst.

2558	DrRobotnik	2013-05-20	I don't like it. He's supposed to be masculine and violent and somewhat of a moral dilemma for Dany...whereas in the show he seems calm and sophisticated, like a twin of Jaqen H'ghar.
2559	Frey Buffet	2013-05-20	Can't stand Daario in the books! I've been dreading his appearance but now...well I am very jealous of Emilia Clarke. /drunk.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':drunk:' />
2560	gash	2013-05-20	i always pictured daario as a kind of captain jack sparrow looking dude. disappointed they went with the young boy band look tbh.
2561	Masamune	2013-05-20	Meh. Just some Abercrombie douche. Could have given him blue hair, at least.
2562	Cas Stark	2013-05-20	He's handsome, he even in a weird way is sort of a blonde mirror image of drogo w/the super long hair.  Very believable as a love interest.
I would have liked a little longer intro or at least a better use of the scene with the Second Sons so he might have been given a better TV motivation for going over to her side.
2563	FacelessFanDragon	2013-05-20	Oh sorry, I thought you were reffering to Daario, as this is a Daario thread.But I dont think there's any culture in our world today that wears anything so garish and cartoony as The three pronged beards and so on. Even penis sheaths are relatively normal compared to that.So you've never seen a Juggalo? or "'80's" Punk Fan?
2564	silentwanderer	2013-05-20	I don't like it. He's supposed to be masculine and violent and somewhat of a moral dilemma for Dany...whereas in the show he seems calm and sophisticated, like a twin of Jaqen H'ghar.Jaqen was more zen about it though, Daario was all over Dany and A Man seemed drawn to Arya's nature more than anything else.
2565	SoooTrypticon	2013-05-20	Ok, um, he's pervy looking, and checked out Dany like a piece of meat (first off, her fault for stepping out that bathtub all naked and wet and glistening!) but you're cool with Mero making blatant jabs at Dany and sniffing Missandei's vag and slapping her ass?I think Mero and Daario are both perfectly attractive, but since Daario doesn't slap ass and vag sniff, I'm going to have to go along with him!I never condoned Mero's actions, I just meant I found him more attractive than the plastic face Daario has. I was actually hoping that they'd cut Daario out completely, since all he does is bog Dany down. The fact that they kept him makes me think there must be more to him. Hopefully he IS the Harpy, betrays Dany's love, and dies by fire.

2568	Dragonmaster	2013-05-20	Uhm, comparing him to Drogo, really? Have you seen his physique?! This Daario is a boy, not dangerous looking at all. He looks too skinny to be a seasoned fighter, Drogo would squeeze him with one hand.
About the "ridiculous" book look; Drogo and as mentioned Jack Sparrow had some pretty freaky (hair)styles and were seen as seriously attractive.

2571	Tony Soprano	2013-05-20	Daario is one of my most hated characters in the books, and a large part of that is owed to his eccentric kind of douchiness. TV Daario comes off as bit too cocky, yes, but not as far as his book counterpart. So, I'll keep my eyes on his character progression. Hopefully they keep with this version, rather than make him more true to the books.
But I'm  happy they kept the daggers! They look great! /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />

Jack Sparrow is a comedy character the likes of which would get chewed up and spit out in aSoIaF.
2573	Dragonmaster	2013-05-20	Drogo's look is the epitome of every barbarian warrior character. Jack Sparrow is a comedy character the likes of which would get chewed up and spit out in aSoIaF.We are talking about looks here. Jack Sparrow has less comedy features in his appearance than bookDaario, but he doesn't exactly get chewed up and spit out. It is the wonder and suprise of looking that ridiculous and exotic and pulling it off, still being crazy goodlooking to women. That sort of thing can be done ----> Drogo/JS.Best thing about showDaario are his knife and arakh.
2574	Vorador	2013-05-20	I like the not-so-common look of book Daario better: an irritaion for all the narrow-minded people who can't imagine someone wanting to dye his hair in another colour than blond, brown, black or red.....
2575	AmareiBlanetree	2013-05-20	He comes across like a comic book character to me. A face like a plastic doll. Not attractive at all, just weird.  Now, the "bad guy" that arrogant dirty talking captain with a scar on his face, that guy was interesting and attractive. Had to die, yes. I could have gone for a little torture of that guy, maybe some girl torture by Missandei.I thought he was cute too. Daario definitely could have kept the gold tooth and still been attractive.
2576	Vorador	2013-05-20	Because blue hair looks awesome on TV, right?In fact yes. It looks awesome.
2577	Vorador	2013-05-20	I like the change to TV Daario, a good looking actor, charming, and seemed less annoying and clownish looking.  I fully support the de-jesterfication of Westeros.

2578	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-20	They kept the sword hilts! I loved this Daario, great stuff!
2579	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-20	OMG. Not-standard hair colour = clownish looking... seriously? Which century are we living in?They meant LESS clownish looking because he doesn't have blue hair...thought that'd be pretty obvious.
2580	Vorador	2013-05-20	I think it's an improvement. I admit, Daario's frankly ridiculous character design prejudiced me against him a little in the books, mostly since I cannot fathom what a smart girl like Dany would see in this guy. In addition to being a self-proclaimed backstabber, he was also looked ridiculous. Blue hair? A three-pronged beard dyed cobalt? A blue-and-gold mustache? What? That the most beautiful woman in the world (in-universe; that's not an exaggeration) would fall for him so hard is a tad bewildering.Ridiculous? You know taste is subjective and not everyone might share the same taste like you? You know Westeros (and especially Essos) are fantasy lands and not america/europe?It astonishes me how fantasy-book readers can't fit slight alterations in culture and habit (compared to our world) in their head.Now it's easier to understand. He's hot.Ehm... he looks a bit like an 80s porn actor now imo. But I imagined him to be sleazy in the books too so that's ok.
2581	WardenOfTheNerds	2013-05-20	He acts way calmer than i imagined. Though the man i pictured is probably too ridiculous for TV
2582	Vorador	2013-05-20	I will not lie, hated the Dario in the books, but I like this one. At least in this one I can understand why Dany would be attracted to him.  In the books he was a blue haired clown.Another ultra-conservative? Other cultures must not have different looks? Sad.
2583	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-20	lol I liked his blue hair.
2584	Frey Buffet	2013-05-20	He acts way calmer than i imagined. Though the man i pictured is probably too ridiculous for TVI agree. In my head, he would be too comical - really over the top movements, a loud, dramatic voice and with a big grin and leerish look thrown in now and then.

2589	gibbles545	2013-05-20	As someone mentioned, with Iain Glen playing Jorah who is quite handsome in the show, introducing a blue haired bearded man with a golden tooth and have Dany falling for him instead of tv Jorah would of  been less believeable.
So instead they did away with these costume choices for something less boistrous, alongside the fact that many people would not be able to get over his appearance. Plus the whole Tyroshi hair dying has not been really mentioned to any degree in the show.
2590	Michael Stark Thenextwolf	2013-05-20	If they wanted to do it this way they should have changed his name.  All us book readers would know who he was supposed to be, and then its not a big deal if he doesnt have blue hair and a goofy beard. 
People on here need to relax, just cuz someone says blue hair is wierd and wouldnt look good on tv doesnt mean they are not open to other cultures, or norms.  I think if any of us saw a guy walking down the street with blue hair and a gold tooth we would be like wow whats his deal.
2591	Magic 8 Ball	2013-05-20	I dont want to be a racist here but HE IS TOO WHITERead his description in the books, pls...Edit : why do people keep assuming Daario is non-white when he is described as paler than Jorah in the books?  I think there may be some implicit racism in the assumption that a person who acts or dresses in a certain way must be a non-white character.  hmm....

2592	Nictarion	2013-05-20	Daario in the books has some swagger in his personality, it was just always tough to take him seriously the way he was described. In the world of ice and fire people would grow up knowing Tyroshi dyed their hair blue but in our world its just weird. The way show Daario looks it is a little easier to understand Dany's decisions.Maybe book Daario is just into the punk rock scene, there is nothing wrong with blue hair.
2593	GoldenFleece	2013-05-20	Maybe book Daario is just into the punk rock scene, there is nothing wrong with blue hair.Yeah, besides women have all different types.  I have red hair, some girls will not even look at me because of it, others can't get enough of it.  Go figure.
2594	Young Nan	2013-05-20	I dont want to be a racist here but HE IS TOO WHITEDaario has blue eyes in the books, usually a trait only found in caucasians.  He also had light enough hair to be able to dye it all kinds of colors.my hair is naturally black, my hair has to be bleached blonde, then dyed to achieve any other color.   If I tried to dye my hair blue, my hair would just take on a blue tint but remain black.  Not saying GRRM is an expert on hair coloring or anything, but it's just more logical that Daario is has light hair given his ability to change it so easily.

Do a quick google on cultures around the world and what they find attractive, how they dress and present themselves. You are frowning in European culture that you cannot see anything else. A lot of the cultures of the world do look ridiculous, it's only natural.This is what made martin's world believable.Previous shows were successful at making odd dressings acceptable, namely Jack Sparrow, but others as well.HBO give up without even trying, that's what upsets me the most.

I don't know the book dude, but this dude was a little weird--a love child of Fabio and some dude in Old Spice deodorant commercial.  That whole group was little too juvenile.

2606	RottenAppleFossoway	2013-05-20	Being a straight man, I can't really give an accurate assessment of his looks. It's certainly different from the books, but that's ok with me, though admittedly, the blue hair, yellow beard and gold teeth wouldn't have bothered me either. The only thing that really bothered me about it in the books was trying to understand how Dany could possibly be attracted to him. I can see how she could go for show Daario though. 
I honestly think the show could use a bit more flamboyance at times. Maybe they'll add it to some of the Braavosi "peacocks" since Jaquen had the hair thing going last season.
 As to the portrayal, Skrein seemed perfect to me. Cocksure, smirky and seemingly utterly falling for Dany immediately; Quite understandable since she's absolutely gorgeous to my eye. He does seem a bit more subtle, which is ok with me. I always thought, like many here, of Jack Sparrow when reading about Daario in the books. Not quite so drunk, but over-the-top behavior. It would have been too comical for GoT.
 And while they're absolutely ridiculous, I'm very pleased that they stayed with book in regards to his "ladies" at his hip. Perfect in every way.

I love to hate Joffrey, he is a great character. Daario, on the other hand, is a poor character, boring and flat. There's absolutely nothing interesting about him. He's ruined a great part of Dany's story since he was introduced. I hate to hate him because he is not interesting at all. His mere existence annoys me. Even Talisa and Ros are more interesting than Daario IMHO.
2609	dttljs123	2013-05-20	By far prefer show Daario to book Daario.Complete disagreement here. Book Daario had swag, tv Daario was awkward, too tall and no facial hair (especially missed the blue). In ASOS, He kills Grazdan and Sallor, but Mero flees during the battle. I hated that Daario beheaded Mero and took  the 2nd sons. How will Brown ben Plumm appear or strong belwas. Daario leads Stormcrows, not 2nd sons.

2611	Pinkie Baelish	2013-05-21	will Jorah ever get a chance to sleep with dany or atleast  to touch her titeeeees ??Based on the trailer for ep 9, we might get some tensions between Jorah and Daario, which could lead to Jorah declaring his love for Daenerys.
2612	Nictarion	2013-05-21	will Jorah ever get a chance to sleep with dany or atleast  to touch her titeeeees ??No. He is stuck in the friend zone for good.
2613	Springs09	2013-05-21	At first I thought he was a girl, then I thought he looked liked a douche and wanted to punch that smug face of his. I think his and Daenerys' romance will be just as annoying as in the book.
2614	TheDarkOne	2013-05-21	I think that the casting of Ramsey and Daario has been part of the best decisions we have seen this year. This is in fact a case of where the show has greatly improved a character from the books.
2615	Koi No Yokan	2013-05-21	The way he smirks whilst someone is talking, and his overall smug look are exactly how I pictured Daario to act. Just need to see him standing there caressing the hilts of his daggers before I'm totally convinced I despise him as much as book Daario!
So yeah, so far I think he's been a good choice. Glad they didn't do the whole blue beard and gold tooth look, as well.
2616	Nictarion	2013-05-21	I think that the casting of Ramsey and Daario has been part of the best decisions we have seen this year. This is in fact a case of where the show has greatly improved a character from the books.I would add Tywin as well. Charles Dance has been fantastic as Tywin. I think he has been better on the show than he was in the books.
2617	Young Nan	2013-05-21	Joffrey has always been one of the main villains of the story, and he moves the plot and is entertaining to read/watch. I love to hate Joffrey, he is a great character. Daario, on the other hand, is a poor character, boring and flat. There's absolutely nothing interesting about him. He's ruined a great part of Dany's story since he was introduced. I hate to hate him because he is not interesting at all. His mere existence annoys me. Even Talisa and Ros are more interesting than Daario IMHO.1,000 times agree with this.  Daario is so obnoxious and his entry into the story marks the decline of Dany's chapters.
2618	Jayuk83	2013-05-21	My main problem with show Daario (and show Mero) is that neither has an accent befitting a Tyroshi and a Bravosi.
2619	BlackTalon	2013-05-21	My main problem with show Daario (and show Mero) is that neither has an accent befitting a Tyroshi and a Bravosi.I am a non-native speaker and even I found Mero's accent a bit jarring ... somehow it sounded so typically british dialect/working class. What kind of accent is he speaking, precisely?
2620	The Mondrian Oak	2013-05-21	My main problem with show Daario (and show Mero) is that neither has an accent befitting a Tyroshi and a Bravosi.Now, that's the only thing that bothered me. I know, there ary plenty of people who speak other languages with almost no accent. I was not bothered by Missandei's lack of accent, or Illyrio's, since he is supposed to be a very experienced high-level, merchant. But two sellswords? The Titan's Bastard should have really had a Spanish/Italian/Greek accent, just like Syrio.
2621	AndrAs Garcia	2013-05-21	Did anyone else think that the man playing Daario was only really good looking when he didn't smile or talk? As soon as he moved his face he looked very goofy.
2622	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2013-05-21	Maybe it;s just cause we aren't in dany head and she's not going gaga over him, but i like this version seems toned down which is good, tribeard,blue hair and gold teeth would look silly.
2623	AndrAs Garcia	2013-05-21	Being a straight man, I can't really give an accurate assessment of his looks.Pffff...
2624	Huta	2013-05-21	I do agree that the colored tribeard, gold tooth and colored hear would be a bit much but they could have spiced him up a little. I would have gone with just blue hair, that would have set him apart and shown that the world has a (much) bigger variety of cultures than that we have seen so far. I also fear that they won't give him the flamboyant clothes that he is supposed to have.
2625	The Mondrian Oak	2013-05-21	Did anyone else think that the man playing Daario was only really good looking when he didn't smile or talk? As soon as he moved his face he looked very goofy.Well, I'll let him bang me anytime, if he asks nicely, with that crooked smile of his!
2626	Runaway Penguin	2013-05-21	I don't like Daario looking like an elf... They should have gone for the multi-colored beard and mustachios /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
2627	Jorah the Explorer	2013-05-21	In the preview for next episode, Daario is touching Dany's hand.  I threw up eleven times all over my computer.
2628	Joey Beers	2013-05-21	When I first saw him on screen I hated him. He wasn't what I pictured. He was younger and less bold looking (where's the hair color?). But, the actor did a good job of establishing the intrigue that Dany has with him. So, I think he will make a good Daario. Just give him and everyone else in the show the colors described in the books!
2629	WTFSalami	2013-05-21	I purposefully changed Daario's appearance in my head every time he was in a scene in the book because I refused to picture someone that looked that stupid. Really glad that they created a new look. He seems to have nailed the Daario persona though, and in the end that's the only thing that matters. Those two at the very least are going to look much better banging than what we got in season 1 with the adventures of Barbarian and Stockholm Girl.

2630	HouseLark	2013-05-21	He done well and everything but I'm sad that that Essos is losing its sense of "otherness" in the show. Daario and Mero have Westerosi accents (take your pick from the Reach, Lannisport or King's Landing) when I would have preferred a hint of a foreign tongue. And making them both Cockney geezers... damn; I was half expecting one of them to try and sell Dany a car stereo that they had "acquired".
2631	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-21	I never understood the hatred for Daario, we don't get inside Dany's head in the show so we don't have her pining over him all the time, plus, she can have sex with whoever she wants. 
Daario could have at least had a blue STREAK in his hair. /crying.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':crying:' />

2638	Versiroth	2013-05-21	It's actually hilarious to me that he's so excepted due to the fact that he's pretty....  I mean, adding attractive women to the Theon scene was "OMG, Teh Shame!!", but making Daario some pretty boy seems to be a-ok,  Haha.
Either way, personally, I didn't mind the actor as I think he portrays the character well.
2639	Oleg	2013-05-21	Because she stood naked in front of him, but Daario only had eyes for the cheeks on her face.oh, and i wonder why she actually stood naked in front of him. She could have simply sent him away, but no /bang.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bang:' />

2642	flinn	2013-05-21	I never realized how comic bookish so many of the characters are in Song until the series started and so many characters cut out or changed because of their comic book appearance in the series. Now that it has been pointed out, it actually is making me think many things in the books were much more silly in hindsight.

Now that it has been pointed out, it actually is making me think many things in the books were much more silly in hindsight.It's not so much that they are comic bookish as they would seem so in the tv series due to lack of exposition.  GRRM can have 10 pages full of exposition in the book as to why a Tyroshi dyes their hair, but for the show, you simply can't do this.  So, things either have to be spoken aloud or changed.   In this case, changing it was likely a much better option than adding in some lines explaining it.

I wonder if they'll show Jon and Aegon with blue hair... but it looks like they won't make the culture of Essos clear in the show.. Damn, I really wanna see the way those people wear such fancy hair colors...
2645	Vorador	2013-05-21	Example how Daario might look like with blue hair.Mind that the drawing might not be the best depiction but it clearly shows that an exotic look is possible without the character looking clownish or ridiculous like so many said it would.I love the TV show and don't think it's necessary to include every detail of the rich world G.R.R.

2647	Ororo727 Jon Snow Fangirl	2013-05-21	idk man I would do book Daario too.And tv Jorah, probably.Book Daario is hot!
2648	Ororo727 Jon Snow Fangirl	2013-05-21	He's delicious. Ok, ok, and a good actor. I do miss his multi colored hair and my biggest complaint about this season is that the people of Essos (Essonians?) don't look like what they're supposed to. They're not ethnic, they don't have their unique stylings and crazy wardrobes. None of it. They all look like Westerosis in a tokar.I'm watching it again, and Darrio's on. Later.YES!
2649	Ororo727 Jon Snow Fangirl	2013-05-21	like I said, book Daario has the appearance of a MARTIAN PIMP and TV Daario looks like he filmed "Magic Mike". HBO put him in for the female viewers because of the flack the are getting for "degrading women". If these people read the books, UGH, atleast not the "lady"There weren't any martian pimps in Westeros. Book Daario was hot and so is TV Daario.  I wish they would have given him blue hair to go along with his "ladies".

Syrio is darker complected and has a different accent and speech pattern, and Salladhor Saan is obviously black, but Melisandre of super-remote Asshai and Thoros of Myr could pass in King's Landing.  The Ghiscari aren't different enough, either.  While I understand the producers want to avoid what JRRT did that got him accused of racism in the current era, it is just as foolish, IMO, for both continents to be completely dominated by ethnic northern europeans.  Indeed, isn't that MORE racist, if anything is?

She could have simply sent him away, but no /bang.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bang:' />I thought it was a fantastic way to show the shift of power.He intruded on one of the most vulnerable positions she could have been in.  No dragons, no guards, no Jorah or Barristen to protect her.  He had a knife to Missendei's throat and could have killed either or both of them with very little fanfare.  So Dany rose up in front of him naked, and within 20 seconds, Daario was on his knees in front of her, pledging his sword, life and love.
2662	insertname	2013-05-21	Hot? This guy? Okay....I mean he's not totally ugly or anything, but there's just something off about his face...

2663	Zorpack	2013-05-21	That<U+0080><U+0099>s the whole point of making something INTERESTING be it a book or a series.

But NO, people want a good looking guy in the standards of our OWN society, which makes no sense because westeros and essos are not north america.We lose culture identity. Like someone else previously mentioned ppl in essos now simply look like westerosis with some tunic.Tell me if you go in brazil and see people dressing completely different and basically looking very different from you, would you think they can<U+0080><U+0099>t get anywhere in the world? Your comment reeks of ethnocentrism, one of the worst types of perspective one can have.And it seems it is shared by many in this forum judging by the comments on this thread. pfffIt's funny you say that since most of North American youth has multi colored hair at this point. With tattoos and rings all over their faces and bodies....very similar to Essos from the book. Hmmm...maybe they are trying to make the show different from actual reality so we can separate well written characters portrayed in the show from Nicki Minaj and Lady Gaga.

2667	Lady Lea	2013-05-21	http://i.imgur.com/2VNvaIk.jpgNot bad imoYeah I think that would look a little too Hot Topic customer though. I don't know if it would translate very well. In the books we hear about people from Tyrosh dyeing their hair all the time, but in the tv show Tyrosh wasn't even mentioned, so I think it might be weird to just throw that out there and see if it sticks. JMOExample by an unknown (to me) artist "autumn":http://24.media.tumb...u00pmo1_500.jpgAnother example by the well known "A Song of Ice and Fire" Artist Amoka:http://awoiaf.wester...rio_Naharis.jpgWhoa that first drawing is wonderful. Kind of how I imagined him really. Very good.I hate the second one, and honestly, he looks super old and creepy and the artist got the beard totally wrong. I don't like that artist's work but I know they are very influential in the fandom since the wiki uses them.
2668	Zorpack	2013-05-21	Everyone is up in arms about the un-ethnic look of Essos, but from the VERY start I didn't think Dany and Viserys looked everything like I imagined a Targaryen to look. I've always been heart broken that they havent shown the silver-white hair and violet eyes of the Targaryens or the greenish tint to the Reeds, etc..... It's almost unbelievable that they deliberately left out SO much of the visual characteristics of the people of the realm which completely enamored me from the very start of reading.  I can never understand why they are okay with dragons and wights but fail to explore the mystical culture of the books and in doing so they would create a more definite contrast between the continents, the 7 kingdoms and the north and south in westeros.

They even have proper purple ones, brand contacts, not that shit people buy on halloween, and it looks gorgeous. Emilia would have looked great with them. Heh, while people are talking about hair color... the Lannisters' hair colors have bothered me most of all. What happened to the golden blonde?The actors all have dirty, light brown hair.

Emilia would have looked great with them.Yeah, the violet eyes really would have been spectacular.Yeh, I was always determined to somehow play Mya Stone as I have the pale skin, blue eyes and jet black hair, but in the show there's nothing extraordinary about the way Robert looked. Okay that did come out wrong, he's really not ugly, I was just surprised that so many think he's hot. i was only teasing /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />each to their own!YAY! That top piece of fanart is how I imagined him. The Amoka picture is kind of STD-ridden repulsive.I hope Daario gets a blue streak or something. The Agonist singer Alissa White-Gluz pulls off blue hair; I think the secret is it isn't totally blue, there's white and darker shades.lol ive been wishing him a blue streak too! it would be awesome!
2678	Maizel	2013-05-21	I couldn;t care less about some of the eye/hair colors. I notice them,  but for me they don;t detract much from the overall experience. There are things that grate me alot more. Mostly the weird Gendry thing going on now. 
I know why they chose Gendry to do this stuff,  but I think an extra Edric Storm character would have worked much better, despite the added confusion for some viewers.
2679	Aurane Velaryon	2013-05-21	I'm sorry but Amoka's characters just look awful to me, the only ones that I actually like are the Targaryen men and Eddard, the rest are just so odd and disturbing. no one should be getting their image of Daario from Amoka's work, how many fans would Dany have if this is what people imagined she looked like? http://en.amokanet.r...2460757410e5243most beautiful woman indeed...she looks like a lifeless doll with a giant forehead...I once found artwork of a rather handsome Daario but he was kissing Hizdahr, too bad I can't find it anywhere.

2681	Weeping Sore	2013-05-21	I would really love to see his blue hair and golden mustache in the show... but it'll look really ridiculous.. disappointed because of that but I don't care since that Daario is really hot /drool.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':drool:' />I wonder if they'll show Jon and Aegon with blue hair... but it looks like they won't make the culture of Essos clear in the show.. Damn, I really wanna see the way those people wear such fancy hair colors...You know, I think a kind of rougher-looking actor could have rocked the blue hair just fine, I think it might seem a little feminine with show Daario's pretty-boy looks.  I feel like book Daario was flamboyant on top of badass, and this one's more...beautiful.  Maybe I should stop myself here.Let's say he's making a good case for more nudity-parity on this show.
2682	'96Buck	2013-05-21	They said they didn't do contacts because it would mess with the acting, a lot of emotion is conveyed through the eyes.Wearing contacts, even colored ones, does not impact the expressiveness of the eyes.  I'm also not sure there have ever been any actors able to control their own pupil dilation, anyway, even if the contacts did interfere with seeing that.

I'm also not sure there have ever been any actors able to control their own pupil dilation, anyway, even if the contacts did interfere with seeing that.I saw a reference that they tried contacts and one or more actors found them too uncomfortable, a distraction, so D & D decided to scrap it.
2684	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-21	Contacts don't actually suit every eye type, I know a lot of people who aren't comfortable wearing them. Luckily my eyes suit contacts (because of my poor eyesight, not colour contacts) perfectly. 
But after a few hours they do feel heavy and irritating.
2685	Aurane Velaryon	2013-05-21	the Daario I envisioned looked sort of like this. http://www.eric-eteb...piratedude2.jpg
but his eyes, hair, clothes and personality are flamboyant like this. http://24.media.tumb...u00pmo1_500.jpg
put the two together and that's basically how I envisioned Daario. the first image can also pass for a decent Oberyn Martell too.
2686	Jayuk83	2013-05-21	I am a non-native speaker and even I found Mero's accent a bit jarring ... somehow it sounded so typically british dialect/working class. What kind of accent is he speaking, precisely?He's speaking a sort of Cockney accent - for the record, I know the actor personally as I was in a film called 'The Callback Queen' with him - and to clarify, my problem isn't with his performance, but the choice to have him speaking in his native accent. And Daario's accent was a bit weird. Sort of R.P (i.e, standard English accent), but there were certain words that came out with an East London twang.Now, that's the only thing that bothered me. I know, there ary plenty of people who speak other languages with almost no accent. I was not bothered by Missandei's lack of accent, or Illyrio's, since he is supposed to be a very experienced high-level, merchant. But two sellswords? The Titan's Bastard should have really had a Spanish/Italian/Greek accent, just like Syrio.Agreed.
2687	Khal Pono	2013-05-21	I once found artwork of a rather handsome Daario but he was kissing Hizdahr, too bad I can't find it anywhere.bwahahaha! find it, find it!
2688	silentwanderer	2013-05-21	I didn't care much by how he looked as long as he was a believable mercenary.
I feel the show achieved that goal.

Lorathi people have consistently German accents!  e.g., the actors playing Shae and Jaqen H'gar :-)

2693	Merope	2013-05-21	Well the Daario in my head always looked a bit like Jack Sparrow with bluish hair. The swagger, the arrogant attitude, the gold tooth.
So I was a bit disappointed TV-Daario didn't have any of the traits. But I can't argue that Ed Skrein isn't good-looking. I can't even decide whether I like him better with or without the wig.
So from that shallow standpoint I'm ok with the casting. We'll see if he can pull it off with his acting, too. I mean, he's got TV-Jorah to compete with!
2694	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-21	He's pulling off the sleaze of the book character so far. /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />

Lorathi people have consistently German accents!  e.g., the actors playing Shae and Jaqen H'gar :-)Erm... They're actors... They can surely do a Greek/Italian accent or whatever. I put together my own audition tape for Daario last year and I inflected a sort of Italian/North African one. I'm not saying I should have got the role, but what I am saying is actors should be able to portray different accents, etc.

Unless the accent is a huge part of the character (think of some of Meryl Streep's roles, etc.), you're going to get a better performance if the actor speaks in an accent he/she is most comfortable in.It would be different it were a movie about Italian gangsters and everyone had an Italian accent so the non-Italian actors had to fake it.  But this place takes place in a mish-mash of fictional settings, it would just be kind of weird to have one British actor faking an Italian accent, one Italian actor faking a Cockney accent, etc.  It can get very convoluted/unnecessary.  Or it could just get weird and racist like George Lucas's use of accents in Star Wars Episode I.I think the canon the show has established is that people from Westeros and the Free Cities have English, German, Dutch and other European accents and that people from deeper Essos (slaver's bay etc., Dothraki sea) have non-European accents.  But not even this is followed consistently, and you'll make yourself crazy if you try to keep track of who should have which accent.

2697	'96Buck	2013-05-21	I saw a reference that they tried contacts and one or more actors found them too uncomfortable, a distraction, so D & D decided to scrap it.Now THAT makes sense.  They aren't for everyone, and even people who take to them eventually may not care for them immediately.  If the show really cared, they could purple the eyes with CGI, too.  They obviously don't, they can't even get the Lannister actors to bleach their hair, and while it's not necessary, it would have been better for Shireen to have black hair also.

I agree that mastering whatever a Tyroshi accent is might have been a distraction. I don't know-Peter Dinklage's British accent is really quite bad but I hardly notice it now; I think it's better than having him speak with an American accent. Jaime and Joffrey really kill their accents (the "good" kill) to my ear.  Anyone else going way off their real accent?

I don't care though, because his performance is so monstrously good, I don't care that his English accent isn't perfect.I believe that Conleth Hill's Varys accent is quite different from his normal speaking voice, as he is a Belfast man.  Hard to tell though because Conleth doesn't do GoT interviews.On a semi-related note, I always find it hilarious that Robb Stark speaks in the thickest Scottish brogue (okay that's a bit of an exaggeration) but all his siblings (except Jon, who tries to do a Northern accent) speak the Queen's English.

The actor is Scottish but he's clearly doing a Northern English accent for the role (as is Kit Harington). Admittedly, Isaac, Sophie and Maisie are doing their natural accents (RP and Bristolian in Maisie's case).

2707	HouseLark	2013-05-21	Agree.  Syrio is darker complected and has a different accent and speech pattern, and Salladhor Saan is obviously black, but Melisandre of super-remote Asshai and Thoros of Myr could pass in King's Landing.  The Ghiscari aren't different enough, either.  While I understand the producers want to avoid what JRRT did that got him accused of racism in the current era, it is just as foolish, IMO, for both continents to be completely dominated by ethnic northern europeans.  Indeed, isn't that MORE racist, if anything is?The reason Tolkien is criticised for "othering" is because his dark skinned men were all evil collaborators with the Dark Lord. The people of Essos are as much a mixed bag as the people of Westeros so there's no chance of producers being accused of racism. I think they just don't care that much about establishing Essos as a strange and different continent.
2708	Le Cygne	2013-05-21	I'm such a romantic, but I hope Daario brings Dany flowers like he did in the book.
Theda, when he comes back he can have a blue streak, like Jaqen's white one.  It's the thing in show Essos.
2709	silentwanderer	2013-05-21	I'm such a romantic, but I hope Daario brings Dany flowers like he did in the book.Beats a couple of heads if you ask me.
2710	Lady Arwen	2013-05-21	Wow, they really hit the nail on the head with Daario. Giving him a less over-the-top aesthetic was a good move, IMO. His charisma is perfection.
2711	Blind Beth the Cat Lady	2013-05-21	I always pictured Book Daario's looks as more '80's-punk-apolcalyptic-Mad-Max style than clownish, which I thought was pretty cool.  He had kind of a punk-warior attitude, too.  No respect for kings/lords/whoever, if someone bothers you just slice 'em open.  But more importantly I think Book Dany is attracted to him more for his wild nature and fierce loyalty to her than for his looks.  He's obviously not a good person per se, but he's 100% loyal to Dany.  Not my type, but I understand Dany's feelings, especially since she otherwise spends her time trying to be a voice of reason and listen to voices of reason and be moderate, so she naturally enjoys being able to cut loose and be crazy and irresponsible with Daario. 
I was hoping for a more wild-looking Daario in the show.  My first thought was "oh no, it's Legolas!"  I'm firmly an Aragorn fangirl, not in the Legolas camp.  But the surprise rugged jawline and the near-perfect interpretation of Daario's irrepresible personality won me over.  I like book Daario, and I'm also on board with show Daario.  Kind of wish he'd do something less Legolas-y with his hair though...
2712	Le Cygne	2013-05-21	Agreed.  I think she sees him clearly, she just likes him for who he is, in spite of his flaws.  Love doesn't come with a lot of conditions, it just happens.
2713	silentwanderer	2013-05-21	Problem is the only man Daenerys has ever been in love with was her husband.
And she didn't marry because she loved him, she loved him because they were married.
Daario is supposed to be the first time the Khalessi approaches things in the right order (or at least she would've had if the guy would've been marriage material)

2714	PhoenixFlame	2013-05-21	Eh, Dany's obsession with Daario is understandable given her difficult circumstances but it's still weird. Like how she stays up alllll night staring at him. I love this guy in the show though. He's really attractive but not generic prettyboy. His bone structure is interestingly odd. 
Oh God color contacts...even really good brand ones make my eyes burn. I wouldn't be able to emote in them because I'd be blinking like a nutcase. I think it was a good call to nix them. Also, color contacts aren't solid color--they do slightly change a person's eyes because they have "highlights" and shadings on them, so up close it can look weird.
2715	Anarchosaurus Rex	2013-05-21	In the books, Daario is a ludicrous and bombastic braggart, not a sly and smarmy dandy.

2719	Le Cygne	2013-05-21	Problem is the only man Daenerys has ever been in love with was her husband.I think she's in love with Daario, she calls him "her love" and thinks about him constantly while she's wandering the grasslands.

I agree that it would be a reminder that it is no children's story, but I would be more comfortable with it and I think people in general would be more comfortable with it if it had the purpose of following the books (as Dany's single-breasted dress would), rather than random nude scenes thrown in here and there.
2728	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-21	I wouldn't mind any of the nudity used that is in the books with characters we know and enjoy. I hate a lot of the added one dimensional whore scenes (Pod, anyone?) that are only put in to fill some nudity quota. 
Seriously, most of the whore scenes were only put it for ''tits and ass'' and really don't add to the show AT ALL.
I have no problem with nudity and sex, so if they were to put in the nudity and sex that is in the novels, that would be okay. 
But there are so many story arcs this season that could have benefited with more time and care and yet they have minutes and minutes to waste on pointless whore scenes.
2729	Le Cygne	2013-05-21	It's much better this season but it's still too imbalanced, female to male nudity.  Way more female nudity.  And the viewing numbers are close to 50-50 (45-55).

People watching the show who havent read the books just think that he is smalltime dealing with whorehouses and such. I think it gives the effect of LF being a really sly and shady guy once they figure out more about him in the next seasons.
2731	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-21	Pod's scene in particular didn't really serve any purpose, you should have hidden LF's character in a lot of other ways.It's much better this season but it's still too imbalanced, female to male nudity.  Way more female nudity.  And the viewing numbers are close to 50-50 (45-55).Why most men in Westeros have sex fully clothed whilst women have to be naked too is beyond me. I hate Robb and Talisa, but at least their scene was actually a nice portrayal of sex in the show.
2732	Le Cygne	2013-05-21	At least they caught on to the women want to see male butt thing (somewhat, if you had binoculars you could see Jon Snow's tush).  Bare chests weren't cutting it.  And this is totally on topic because Dany and Daario have a lot of sexy scenes.  And Daario is anything but shy.

But there are so many story arcs this season that could have benefited with more time and care and yet they have minutes and minutes to waste on pointless whore scenes.I have an idea how HBO will fill the nudity quota next year- just have Doran's Water Gardens be 18+ only! And of course 95% of shots will be of well-groomed naked women frolicking, with a few fleeting male butt-shots thrown in as an afterthought. (Seriously, of the two penises shown on GoT, one of them had to be Hodor's? Though it has been one per season- still waiting for season 3's penis. Whose will it be? Cast your vote!)

Edmure ??!At least they caught on to the women want to see male butt thing (somewhat, if you had binoculars you could see Jon Snow's tush).  Bare chests weren't cutting it.  And this is totally on topic because Dany and Daario have a lot of sexy scenes.  And Daario is anything but shy.Hahahaa, yes, exactly. They reeeeaally can't get away with a clothed Daario in the show with a fully nude Dany (during sex). It would be ridiculous.

2737	Khal Pono	2013-05-21	i always find it jarring when non-pornographic movies show penises during sex scenes.  not because of the nudity, but because they are unrealistically flaccid (like Gendry's was in the most recent episodE) and it takes me out of the moment.
i think it's kind of taboo to show erect penises onscreen except in porn...
2738	Summerqueen	2013-05-21	The sex scenes with mostly clothed men remind me of Excalibur where all the ladies in their soft, diaphanous gowns are groping and rubbing around on super shiny armored knights--trying to embrace/cuddle up to a big metal structure, basically. It's kinda ridiculous. So, too, the standard GoT sex scene. World of Ice and Fire women like to get chafed by homespun. Who knew.

2740	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-05-21	There's a scene in S1 when Theon just gets done banging Ros and about 5 seconds later as she moves away he's completely flaccid. It is a bit weird, and I don't think I'm in the minority for not really wanting to see dudes with erect dicks on TV.

And Hodor's wasn't even real, it was a prosthetic.If we get season 3 peen it will probably belong to someone we don't care to see. Like Walder Frey. Eh? Maybe they'll do a sexposition with him and a 18 year old bride. Oh god now I'm giving them ideas.

It is a bit weird, and I don't think I'm in the minority for not really wanting to see dudes with erect dicks on TV.Doesn't the minority have a say? To be fair, you have a point about the potential for full frontal male nudity to throw off the verisimilitude of sex scenes- The Dany-Drogo scenes for example certainly seemed real without resorting to full frontal. The reason for sex scenes on a show is an extension of the investment you have in the characters. That's why the Dany & Mel scenes in 308 are great in my book; far better than the embarrassing Ramsay girls in 307 or Pod sex machine in 303. If you want meaningless, watch porn.
2743	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-05-21	Of course the minority have a say. That's what like this whole forum is.
I didn't like the Ramsay's girls scene, nor the Pod scene, but it's HBO. I have no data to prove it, but I would imagine they cater to their majority audience who want nudity even when an episode doesn't necessitate it.
2744	Nezzer	2013-05-22	But we did get PYCELLE peenWHAT?? No, we didn't! I think that's only in the book.

2746	The Mondrian Oak	2013-05-22	Perhaps... but that kind of coherence/analogical consistency can be tough to manage, if you can't find the right Greek actor, etc.  They have to be flexible in casting.One thing you have to give them credit for... Lorathi people have consistently German accents!  e.g., the actors playing Shae and Jaqen H'gar :-)Well, I think the italian accent is one of the easiest accents to imitate. Of course, I'd like actors not to sound like Supermario, but hey, Mero had what, 7 lines? Hardly an effort!The thing is, when I first heard Syrio, I thought "this is perfection. Bravoos was based on Venice, the lad here speaks with an italian accent". Perfect. But Mero? Personally speaking, I have a handful of colleagues who can speak with pitch perfect american/british accents. I myself have the thickest Bath accent. But that's because we are interpreters! Two sellswords? No way. I may accept Daario, he will be around for a pretty long time, so he has to act as natural as possible. But Mero had 7 lines!

2760	silentwanderer	2013-05-22	Eh, Dany's obsession with Daario is understandable given her difficult circumstances but it's still weird. Like how she stays up alllll night staring at him.Then again, Daenerys is just 17. Most girls her age spend hours obsessing over a guy they like, not freeing slaves, raising dragons and trying to build an Empire.I think Daario was supposed to remind us just how young Dany truly is.

Well the ones I can remember are:
- part of Theon's in season one.
- part of Pycelle's  through his clothes in season one
- Hodor's in season 2 I think? or one?
- Olyvar's (?) the gay squire. In this season.
- A tiny little part of Gendry's in this episode.

While I personally didn't find him that attractive, I've no doubt he's generally considered to be good-looking, so I guess I can see why Dany would choose him over ser Jorah (who, IMO, is the hottest male in the show) /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />

2770	Trinket2	2013-05-22	I didn't like how they cast him, actually. He looked too boyish. He's hot, but I always pictured Daario more of the same type as Drogo- the manly, macho, dangerous-looking type. This guy is nothing like that at all.

This guy is nothing like that at all.You're right that he seems younger than he seemed in the book.  I kind of like the change because the power relationship is reversed from Drogo-Dany to Dany-Daario.  She's the queen, and he's the consort of her choice, based in no small part on his looks. But I think this actor can convincingly play dangerous- apart from emptying a bag full of heads. And Jorah's going to hate him, not least because Daario makes him look old. Should be TV gold.
2772	'96Buck	2013-05-22	The reason Tolkien is criticised for "othering" is because his dark skinned men were all evil collaborators with the Dark Lord. The people of Essos are as much a mixed bag as the people of Westeros so there's no chance of producers being accused of racism. I think they just don't care that much about establishing Essos as a strange and different continent.No chance of being accused of racism?

2773	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-22	I imagined him looking like a younger jack sparrow with blue hair. They can ditch the weird golden mustache and forked beard, but the blue hair was always pretty cool.
2774	Sniraga	2013-05-22	The blue hair would've indeed been nice, but it was not unexpected that they'd tone Daario's fashion choices down. They seem to be aiming for a more general pseudo-historical look than Martin did in the novels. (Besides, it also seems like only the Targaryens have kept their distinctive looks (minus the purple eyes) and there's no real differences between the rest of the characters. Theon for example could be look-wise as easily a relative to Jaime, Ned or Shireen than to Yara.)
I just remembered Young Griff and his blue hair... Daario would've been a great chance to introduce such a hairstyle, so maybe they'll ditch the quirky hair colour in his case as well. /frown5.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':frown5:' />

2778	Sniraga	2013-05-22	i was thinking that, jon con and aegon, will  they have blue hair?If they do, without precedents the hair colour will come out of blue. (sorry, couldn't resist)
2779	Angmar	2013-05-22	Theon's penis appeared a bit in Season 2.
And I do think there's this strange case of exotic-ness to be found in Martin's novels. Most of the Essosi are characters with negative stereotypes connected to POC through the ages (Essos is more sexual than prudish Westeros and Westerosi think of that as horrible, they practice slavery, they appear as untrustworthy and savage and wild- same case with Dorne imo). /dunno.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':dunno:' />
Anyway, I think Daario is okay. Jaqen H'ghar was much hotter imo. /cool4.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':cool4:' />
I just tremble thinking about ADWD in the show.
In that book Daario's worst moments were shown, would the people stomach an entire season of Dany solving crazy politics in a hot-ass land and thinking about fucking Daario 24/7?
Will the audience drop?
2780	The_Gallows_Knight	2013-05-22	i was thinking that, jon con and aegon, will  they have blue hair? They can always have it dyed black or something.

I'm attracted and repulsed by him all at the same time,and I think that could be what GRRM was going for with book-Daario(IDK of course, but thats how I felt).

And I love the nicknames that northerners and southerners give to each other like "terrone" and "polentone" (just mentioning, not mean to offend) /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' /> Italians are so fun!Ahah, that is some top notch information! And don't worry, those terms are not really offensive. Unless you add "filthy" before them, but then, what isn't, when proceeded by it? We are funny wankers, I believe. Though every region will tell you they're the funniest, their cooking the tastiest, their land the most beautiful. And every city will say it when comparing itself to neighbouring cities. And so will people, when comparing themselves to other people. A hard place to live in, indeed!For some reason that gif makes me laugh uncontrollably.I sincerely hope that gif is severly slowed down, because that sword movement has "STAGED!" written all over it.

2805	Queen Elsa	2013-05-23	Then again, Daenerys is just 17. Most girls her age spend hours obsessing over a guy they like, not freeing slaves, raising dragons and trying to build an Empire.I think Daario was supposed to remind us just how young Dany truly is.I agree. Ser Barristan thinks that she loved her captain but that was the girl in her - the girl in her who yearned for poetry, passion, and laugher.Coming soon to an episode near you.  /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />Ok, we didn't see him fight in the books but this one looks bamf.
2806	silentwanderer	2013-05-23	I agree.

2813	Queen Elsa	2013-05-23	But I want to see how good is this Daario in an actual battle.In the book, it's questionable. In the show, we'll probably see a hunky Daario swinging his arakh left and right, up and down, left and right again, in an actual battle...and some wimmenz will go, "Oh, Daario. Oh, Daario." I bet on that.

2815	silentwanderer	2013-05-23	The character looked somewhat young for a Lieutenant when compared to his now deceased Captains.
I reckon TV Daario must be some sort of Jaime Lannister on that corner of the world ( Granted, a Jaime Lannister who still lacks a conscience and still has two hands, but unless Brienne crosses the Narrow Sea I don't think that's going to change).
I want to see what happens when that kind of Jaime Lannister clashes with the the likes of Barristan Selmy on the show (and  Jorah or Grey Worm, if possible).

2825	Raksha the Demon	2013-05-24	I found the character a huge improvement over the book version.  Of course, I barely remembered the book version; just that his name was Daario and he was blue-haired and swaggered and was a pirate or a sellsword.  TV-Daario would not intrigue me, but I could see why a young woman of Dany's age, especially one who missed her late swaggering macho husband, might be interested in him.  He's not totally unbelievable.  Though I do think he would betray Daenerys if a better offer, or a hotter woman, came along.  Good scene between them, what with his giving her the heads and swearing allegiance.  Poor Jorah is going to have some major hissy-fits!  (cheer up, TV-Jorah; TV-Daario won't have your cheekbones when he's your age!)

2829	Lady Lea	2013-05-24	Wow, fantastic, thanks Khal Pono and Nezzer. Wonderful detail.
And I hadn't noticed Daario's sandals either. So stylish.
2830	Weeping Sore	2013-05-25	I think the Dany-Daario thing is really going to work- there's obvious chemistry already. There's only so much to be gotten out of the Barristan-Jorah rivalry.
As for Daario's  whiteness, the Tyroshi can't be far from white if JonCon (a red-headed Andal) and Aegon (a Targ) expected to pass. The Free Cities seem to be pretty Euro, though we basically learn nothing of Tyrosh other than the blue hair thing.
Maybe they tested a blue wig and just thought he looked too anime-cosplay. Or it really just looked too much like a wig.
To really tie back to up-thread topics, I'm wondering are the Tyroshi circumcised? Which Westeros/ Essos cultures/ religions would be? I'm thinking Old Gods/ Drowned God- no. If it's R'hllor- yes, is Mel available to do a Bris?

The guy leering after Dany and Missandei had waaaaay more swagger IMHO.

2848	Citadel_acolyte	2013-05-29	I'm pro Daario.  Book Daario has always been described as good looking, albeit with an outlandish look. I pictured him as having a roguish, piratical appearance, but with rippling lean muscles like this actor has. I agree with others that the blue beard would not have translated well to the screen although I, for one, have no trouble imagining how the book character could have one and still be attractive to Dany.

2856	Danken	2013-06-21	lack of beard and colorsbut ok to mewell, with this we can be pretty sure there won't be Storm CrowsDefinitely. The problem is, I don't see how they're going to keep the story going as in the books. The implications of the Second Sons are important to the plot, later on converging with Tyrion's and Jorah's. Now that the showmakers have made Daario their captain, how are they going to make that happen? Will they make him betray Danaerys to Yunkai to keep the story going, even if he is very loyal to her in the books? It would certainly provide all the future drama they need, considering the cheesy way they're starting to draw Daario/Daenarys romance in..
2857	Sleeve of Wizard	2013-06-21	TV Daario should have a gold tooth. It would enhance his gangster credentials. Otherwise he simply looks like an underwear model. I also wonder if his look is specific enough to pass for a Targ if they pull an elimination/substitution ala Edric Storm/Gendry with Young Griff/Daario...

Woudn't a Victarion/Tyrion conversation would be priceless?

Woudn't a Victarion/Tyrion conversation would be priceless?Cheers, man!Indeed it would be thrilling and really plausible since both are clearly joining the dragon. They could also introduce Brown Ben as an underofficer of Daario that would betray Denaerys with the greater part of the Second Sons, although it seems quite unlikely..The other thing that annoys me with show Daario is how they have completely changed his character. Despite the aesthetic modifications, good decision by the way, they have harshly inversed his nature. Though they have kept the bloodthirsty part, they have transformed him into a virtue defending philosopher, when the real Daario has a sellsword's unflinching morality. Seriously, making Daario lecture Jorah about dishonor? Daario is also known to boast of having lain with hundreds of women, not really the guy to refuse a whore..

2860	Thelastactionhero	2013-05-19	I just have to say, that while I think its important to take the show and the book as two autonomous works of art, I am highly disatisfied with this simplified portrayal of Stannis. Whether or not you like him as a character in the books, he is far more complex and three-dimensional than he is in this television series. His immediate willingness to sacrifice Gendry was such a let down for me. There wasn't even a split second of conflict. Stannis was adamantly opposed to burning Edric initially and was only convinced when he believed there was absolutely no other option to save the kingdom. Here, Stannis has little to no regard for Gendry's life, and it just felt to me like the writers were purposely ignoring the source material in order to further establish him as villain. Unlike the books, where we have the proper space for us to contemplate Stannis' character and moral ambiguity, the series creates a narrow spectrum in which he can only be viewed as an entitled douchebag. If you're going to make deviations in a character arc, you should maintain the complexity of said characters, rather than simplify them in order to force you're own views down the throats of the audience.
2861	Greyjoy67	2013-05-19	Did you just miss the scene with Davos then I take it....
Stannis hasn't been simplified, I'd say we're just getting his different sides in small doses. It's difficult when you have several pages of exposition to convey on screen you know...
2862	Darth Pipes	2013-05-19	Stannis suffered from some serious character assassination as well.  His sense of justice, though harsh, has been wiped away.  He resisted burning Edric in the books for a long time because the boy had done nothing wrong.  I think Melisandre would have convinced him eventually but it's a disservice to his character that he's not shown struggling with it more.  I guess you can say he is by releasing Davos from jail because he knows Davos can talk him out of it.  But even that moment where Davos lets Edric go and convinces Stannis to go to The Wall might lose its importance.

2864	Kozma	2013-05-19	Stannis knew Edric for the day one and did not get a damn of Gendry he has never seen before. I do not see any conflict here. Plus this scene make me like Mel more.
2865	Mordos_Kull	2013-05-19	Stannis's sense of justice is shown through Davos. He is being portrayed as a tough guy because that is how he wants to be seen. The intimate scenes are where we get more of an insight into Stannis as a person.
2866	Bastard of Boston	2013-05-19	B-b-but, there was that scene with Davos, where Davos essentially called Stannis out for the visit, pointing out that Stannis went down to the cell for Davos to be his voice of reason. That's the entire reason Stannis values Davos -- because Davos reminds Stannis of his humanity.
2867	Nezzer	2013-05-19	I didn't see any sign of character assassination. Didn't you pay attention to the end of his conversation with Davos. He went to see Davos because he knew what Davos was going to say and that part of himself was disagreeing with Melisandre. It's very clear he is conflicted.

2872	Zman1863	2013-05-19	B-b-but, there was that scene with Davos, where Davos essentially called Stannis out for the visit, pointing out that Stannis went down to the cell for Davos to be his voice of reason. That's the entire reason Stannis values Davos -- because Davos reminds Stannis of his humanity.That's how I saw it too. He went down to Davos because he still has doubts about what Melisandre intends. That seems pretty consistent with how the book plays out.
2873	Garlan Marius	2013-05-19	The scene with Davos did wonders for Stannis' on-screen characterization.  Need to see if any illiterati have changed their tunes about him.
2874	A Winters Summer	2013-05-19	Why do I read this forum
2875	Montey14	2013-05-19	I just have to say, that while I think its important to take the show and the book as two autonomous works of art, I am highly disatisfied with this simplified portrayal of Stannis. Whether or not you like him as a character in the books, he is far more complex and three-dimensional than he is in this television series. His immediate willingness to sacrifice Gendry was such a let down for me. There wasn't even a split second of conflict. Stannis was adamantly opposed to burning Edric initially and was only convinced when he believed there was absolutely no other option to save the kingdom. Here, Stannis has little to no regard for Gendry's life, and it just felt to me like the writers were purposely ignoring the source material in order to further establish him as villain. Unlike the books, where we have the proper space for us to contemplate Stannis' character and moral ambiguity, the series creates a narrow spectrum in which he can only be viewed as an entitled douchebag. If you're going to make deviations in a character arc, you should maintain the complexity of said characters, rather than simplify them in order to force you're own views down the throats of the audience.In the book...Edric lives with him and practiacally raised him....On the show...he bareley knows  Gendry...why should he have any feelings for him....but in the end he goes to Davos because he wanted to be talked out of it...thats what I got out of the scene....
2876	BendTheKnee610	2013-05-19	I was somewhat annoyed at his unflinching acceptance of Gendry's impending sacrifice until I realized why he was releasing Davos.
2877	Greyjoy67	2013-05-19	Why do I read this forumI feel the same way. I find my enjoyment of the show stifled by some of the fussiest and unfounded complaints.I guess it's made up for by the valid ones I enjoy debating but still!
2878	Bastard of Boston	2013-05-19	Character assassination has become the buzz word this season, heh. No disrespect to anyone who utilizes the term, but I swear I groan whenever I see it. I'm waiting for the official "character assassination" thread to be christened and enacted each week, much like the nitpick thread. Please, God, don't tell me I just gave anyone the idea. /ph34r.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':ph34r:' />
2879	Naathi Prince	2013-05-19	As others have said, they put the scene with Davos in on purpose to make him look better.
2880	Darth Pipes	2013-05-19	As I recall in the book, Gendry said that Jon Arryn brought Stannis along with him when he met him and Stannis looked at him like he raped his daughter.  So his disregard for Gendry "Part Robert, Part Tavern Whore" is accurate.
2881	Jory	2013-05-19	I missed part of it... it was a mixed bag.
2882	Thelastactionhero	2013-05-19	Yes, I watched the scene with Davos, though I disagree that it was sufficient to properly convey Stannis' moral conflict. I'll grant you that the change from Edric to Gendry certainly takes away Stannis' attatchment to him as a person, seeing as they've never met before, but even the dialogue in the dungeon came off to me as extremely flat and one-dimensional in this regard. When Davos and Stannis discuss the fate of Edric Storm in the books, the discourse is extremely emotional and dramatic. It really highlighted the human qualities of Stannis that lurk beneath the surface of his stoicism.  "I never asked for this crown. Gold is cold & heavy on the head but so long as I am the king, I have a duty <U+0080> If I must sacrifice one child to the flames to save a million from the dark <U+0080> Sacrifice <U+0080> is never easy, Davos. Or it is no true sacrifice.<U+0080><U+009D>Here, I felt it was extremely weak and unconvincing. I realize quotes such as this were partially transmuted from SoS into this scene, but it felt very empty to me. Perhaps that had something to do with delivery as much as it was the writing. He also speaks of sacrificing Gendry nonchalantly to both Mel and Davos that it made it extremely difficult to connect with any sort of inner turmoil, whereas in the books he goes so far as to threaten to kill Mellisandre if it turns out he sacrificed an innocent for nothing. Those instances of opposition to her are actually quite important for his character and none of it is present here. Since they're taking steps to illustrate Stannis as more human and passionate than his book counterpart anyway, why skip out on all this? I peronsally didn<U+0080><U+0099>t feel there was enough development in these cramped scenes to allow us to connect with Stannis<U+0080><U+0099> moral conflict. I will however concede that <U+0080><U+009C>character assassination<U+0080><U+009D> is too strong of a term regarding these scenes, even though I feel maintain that his complexity has been watered down in the adaptation.

2883	The Scabbard Of the Morning	2013-05-19	As a Stannis fan I liked this episode portrayal of him.  He gave us info on what he saw in the fire, and the showed appropriate hesitation on Melisandre's plan.

2886	Jojosh	2013-05-19	Turning stannis into an unambiguous villain is not what they are doing 
They are making him into an even bigger dick 
They have flanderized the most evident aspects of his character being his prickly nature and turned that up to 11
Now you have show stannis 
Not character assassination but its better than painting him as Robert's pathetic brother who just couldn't live up to him
2887	The Ghost of Winter	2013-05-19	I was okay with it, as others have said he did go to Davos to hear what he wanted to and so on. I liked it. He showed some humanity.

You have a valid point in that actors do not always play book characters as you would envision them being in your imagination....I thought thought that scene was pretty good....it would have made no sense for Stannis to try and spare a bastard child he doesn't know....but he does know it's wrong to kill innocent people....or else he wouldn't have gone to Davos....in the end he knew it was wrong and needed to be talked out of sacraficing Gendry....

I dont know how to describe the exact tone that I picked up from Stannis when talking to Davos but I didnt get nonchalant. more like -Mels power is real and she says  we have to do this.......so we have to....right ?

I'm going to rewatch the Davos scene though since there's obviously more value in it than I realized.
2892	Trebla	2013-05-19	I will NEVER in a million years understand the fandom that surrounds Stannis Baratheon. It really does boggle my mind. Part of it may be is that he's quite different from the other lords in the realm. His three closest advisors have been a woman, a bastard, and a smuggler. He may rant, threaten, and grind his teeth when he doesn't hear what he wants but he keeps asking their advice. As Mel told Jon, "it's not his words you should fear but his silences"
2893	JonCon's Red Beard	2013-05-19	In the book...Edric lives with him and practiacally raised him....On the show...he bareley knows  Gendry...why should he have any feelings for him....but in the end he goes to Davos because he wanted to be talked out of it...thats what I got out of the scene....because Gendry is a human being? Stannis is not a monster.BTW, anything we know about Stannis is from other people, and those who claim knowing him. I think those who know him the best are Davos and Maester Cressen, but that doesn't mean they know what's in his head. Stannis might act in a way, but that doesn't mean he's not conflicted about his actions and he also feels tempted or disgusted by things he has done.
2894	dtones520	2013-05-19	I will NEVER in a million years understand the fandom that surrounds Stannis Baratheon. It really does boggle my mind.Because he is not a POV character and 90% of the time we see him is through the eyes of a guy who worships the ground he walks on. So people make their own judgement of him and his actions as being totally badass because that is how Davos pictures most of what Stannis does. It's the same with Robb and him breaking his marriage oath with Jeyne. In the books what Robb did was just as selfish and stupid as what show Robb did. He conquers the Crag, he is wounded and Jeyne takes care of him, they start to become fond of each other, Robb finds out that his brothers died and in his grief he has sex with Jeyne then has this "oh shit, that wasnt honorable!" moment and marries her because she was a virgin. He doesn't consider the war effort when he does that, he does it because he felt bad about *shaming* a girl who willingly had sex with him...while grieving his brothers deaths. I'm sorry but if I just found out my sister was murdered by my once best friend, I dont think I'd be in the mood.
2895	Thelastactionhero	2013-05-19	really ? I dont know how to describe the exact tone that I picked up from Stannis when talking to Davos but I didnt get nonchalant. more like -Mels power is real and she says  we have to do this.......so we have to....right ?Right off the bat when he's talking to Davos about sacrificing Gendry, it sounds as though he doesn't give a flying fuck about the kid. He then proceeds to dehumanize him on the grounds of being a bastard. When he's talking to Mellisandre right after getting back, he knows she's going to kill the boy, and doesn't take any issue with it. The only issue he really brings to mind is prolonging Gendry's torment.

Just, Strong, and Diligent, King Stannis Baratheon, the first of His Name, would have stopped the White Walkers, prevented the Targaryen and Blackfyre invasions, and ruled well. The worst people in the series are the ones who despise him most.
2899	WTFSalami	2013-05-19	It's because he's a boss.Yeah... I don't really get that impression from him. At all.

2901	Garlan Marius	2013-05-19	I don't get the Stannis hate.  He's not the "best" person in the books, but as far as current Iron Throne candidates, he's far and away the best choice.  We're running out of honorable/ just characters, as well.  Not to mention him currently taking up the Stark cause (so some of his fans are certainly Stark supporters).

If he doesnt have an issue with it why is he talking to Davos at all about it ?What he's doing is laying out the argument to Davos because he wants Davos to tell him why he shouldnt do this.that's how I read it because its what I do sometimes when im stressed out about a decision.  I have a gut feeling against it  but I cant articulate it,  so I go to someone who I know will argue against it.

The story just develops more than it does in his Davos chapters.

I'll keep this in mind when I rewatch it. It's clear Davos functions as one side of his conscience, and link to his humanity, but when I saw the scene I felt unconvinced because of how the conversation went down. Maybe if the delivery had been different, I would have been a little more on board.
2905	Thelastactionhero	2013-05-19	No, we see the same old prickly, hard nosed, just Stannis through the eyes of people who don't think his shit smells like chocolate. The story just develops more than it does in his Davos chapters.Your original point was that people like him because most of what we see of Stannis comes from the view of a man who idealizes and romanticizes him. In the Asha and Jon Snow chapters we see him from different vantage points, and in fact I think the character is often more compelling from their POVs than in the Davos chapters. People like Stannis because of his prickly sense of honor and relentlessness, not because Davos places us in a narrow lens where he becomes whitewashed.
2906	wolverine	2013-05-19	Thought this episode did wonders for Stannis' characterization.

Jon is neutral about Stannis, and even when he sometimes hopes he and his party would go away, he respects him enough to care for his approval.
2910	Thelastactionhero	2013-05-19	This thread is an example of why knee jerk reactions are generally bad. This episode was good for Stannis.

If you actually read my responses though, I think there are plenty of valid reasons for not enjoying the direction they're taking the character.
2911	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-05-19	I agree to some degree. I hated the scene with Mel before she leaves. The rest I was fine with. Stannis is really set up to be more likable after they save the wall, in my opinion.

The people he did this to were criminals, but they were still human.

It's not how I pictured Stannis from the source material, but it doesn't deviate in such a way that ruins him. I definitely feel you though on the term getting thrown around too often.
2916	jarl the climber	2013-05-19	I actually like Stannis because of his warts and because he is actually inept in many situations in the context of him being a king. If his unsutablitiy for the throne was not bad enough he is further hampered by the fact that his wife is a harpy, his cheif advisor is a foreigner, female, and a practitioner of dark magic, and his most loyal bannerman is a low born smuggler, who has no real influence in Westeros. Yet despite all these handicaps he is still relavent through a combination of luck, good and bad, perseverance, foes even more inept than him, and occasinal bursts of clarity in both his moral and strategic judgements. His portrayal has been a little flat so far but in the books hes kind of the Westerosi equivalent of a third party candidate and people make him into something he is not, a frontrunner.
2917	JonCon's Red Beard	2013-05-19	Except book Stannis has had people burned alive, which is one of the most painful ways to kill someone that doesn't involve stopping part way through and patching them up so you can keep torturing them (even most cases of burnings in the real world they were actually strangled before the fire was lit).  The people he did this to were criminals, but they were still human.But they were criminals or traitors. Stannis is a leader, and in his own context, he is meant to show others that he's serious about punishing criminals. Gendry is not, nor was Edric, bastards or not, those were innocent children.
2918	Kasrith	2013-05-19	I just have to say, that while I think its important to take the show and the book as two autonomous works of art, I am highly disatisfied with this simplified portrayal of Stannis.

If you're going to make deviations in a character arc, you should maintain the complexity of said characters, rather than simplify them in order to force you're own views down the throats of the audience.I think that - for the show - we need to consider that not everything can be on screen (for such obvious reasons). Stannis is so clearly portrayed as tired. Tired with fighting, tired with being the rightful heir, tired of arguing with his own people. But he still went to Davos just before the sacrifice to get some help with the whole situation, obviously there is still some morality in his involvement of a innocent sacrifice.
2919	lostinwesteros	2013-05-19	I didn't see any sign of character assassination. Didn't you pay attention to the end of his conversation with Davos. He went to see Davos because he knew what Davos was going to say and that part of himself was disagreeing with Melisandre. It's very clear he is conflicted.Edit: /ninja.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':ninja:' /> 'd /agree.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':agree:' />    I'm not a Stannis fan, and yet this episode actually made me like him.
2920	Bran's Legs	2013-05-19	I didn't know where to put this post, but figured it didn't warrant a new topic...
Stannis: "You've slaughtered many lambs?"
Mel: "And none have seen the blade.
Clear foreshadowing that I either have forgotten from the books, didn't catch or it simply wasn't there. Is Mel going to kill Stannis in WoW?
2921	Draco_Dracul	2013-05-19	But they were criminals or traitors. Stannis is a leader, and in his own context, he is meant to show others that he's serious about punishing criminals. Gendry is not, nor was Edric, bastards or not, those were innocent children.So that makes them not human beings?  I'd be more sympathetic if had them garroted against the stake and was effectively burning a corpse, it gets the point across while causing an agonizing death that only takes a few minutes rather than hours.  I can accept that executions are part of the setting, but most of the people that use torturous methods of execution are sadists or madmen.
2922	Prince of Dragonstone	2013-05-19	Tonight's scenes were more a highlight of Melisandre and Davos than Stannis himself. Also, remember that most of our encounters with Stannis in ACoK and ASoS are through Davos Seaworth who is totally devoted and enamored with his King so his opinion of him is a little biased.
2923	Thelastactionhero	2013-05-19	So that makes them not human beings?

I can accept that executions are part of the setting, but most of the people that use torturous methods of execution are sadists or madmen.It doesn't take hours to die burned at the stake, but your point is well stated. It's one of the aspects of Stannis' character I've had the most trouble with. That being said, it isn't an unusual method of execution for the period, and Stannis never has an innocent burned or executed. His sense of justice is so cold and absolute that he'll do horrible things to you if he feels you deserve it. Insinuating that he's a sadist is a little much though, as I think its clear he derives no pleasure from the executions.
2924	Jasta11	2013-05-19	The entire point of the scene is that he goes to see Davos because he thinks it's wrong. It's laid out for the viewers, verbatim. he plays devil's advocate, Davos calls him out on it, sacrifice gets called off. How could anyone possibly understand he took the decision without conflict?The events play out differently, but this is not character assassination in any way, shape or form. I swear this expression has lost most of its impact since people have been using it willy-nilly.
2925	congokong	2013-05-19	Book Stannis would never be so quick to burn an innocent, regardless of if he knew them. He had no hesitation in the show, and only seemingly reconsidered much later after talking with Davos.

2928	JonDunn	2013-05-20	Book Stannis would never be so quick to burn an innocent, regardless of if he knew them. He had no hesitation in the show, and only seemingly reconsidered much later after talking with Davos.Lord you are dense.Please just quit watching the show.
2929	bobbybuilderton	2013-05-20	It really is largely an issue of the way the actor is portraying him than the writing. Looking at what he said and only at what he said, the character is close enough. Tweak the delivery a bit and book Stannis is there, imo.
2930	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-05-20	Book Stannis would never be so quick to burn an innocent, regardless of if he knew them. He had no hesitation in the show, and only seemingly reconsidered much later after talking with Davos.Apparently you missed the entire point of him visiting Davos and freeing him. It was exactly because he was conflicted about it.
2931	Draco_Dracul	2013-05-20	It doesn't take hours to die burned at the stake, but your point is well stated. It's one of the aspects of Stannis' character I've had the most trouble with. That being said, it isn't an unusual method of execution for the period, and Stannis never has an innocent burned or executed. His sense of justice is so cold and absolute that he'll do horrible things to you if he feels you deserve it. Insinuating that he's a sadist is a little much though, as I think its clear he derives no pleasure from the executions.For the medieval period burning death is a very unusual method of execution that was reserved more or less only for heretics and even then they were usually dead before they even felt the flames.  The usual methods of execution for the period were either beheading or short-drop hanging.  To me the burnings indicate how wrapped around Mel's finger he is at that point (not in the sense that he believes in her religion or that he is truly the chosen, but that he has become reliant on her power) because ultimately burning deaths don't speak to a cold unyielding sense of justice to me, they are too wasteful for that.There's someone else who burns people alive. Her name starts with a D.She's not a coin flipped in the air, she's a coin spun on edge.  Even before it has settled you can tell which way it's going land and it seems to be madness.

LATERS
2933	congokong	2013-05-20	Lord you are dense.Please just quit watching the show.Lord you are rude. Instead of me quitting the show, how about you leave this message board.Stannis shouldn't need to run to the dungeons to get someone to convince him of something. Show Stannis is far too indecisive. It's been a frequent complaint.

Instead of me quitting the show, how about you leave this message board.Stannis shouldn't need to run to the dungeons to get someone to convince him of something. Show Stannis is far too indecisive. It's been a frequent complaint.Who convinces Stannis to go to the Wall? Who convinces Stannis to leave Mel behind at Blackwater? Who convinces Stannis to go the Hill Clansemen and not the Dreadfort? Etc... Book Stannis is always listening to good council from honest men. Mostly Davos and later Jon Snow.He's always been someone who needs a push in the right direction.
2935	The_Iron_Captain	2013-05-20	This thread is a big fat joke.
2936	JonCon's Red Beard	2013-05-20	Book Stannis would never be so quick to burn an innocent, regardless of if he knew them. He had no hesitation in the show, and only seemingly reconsidered much later after talking with Davos.The fact that he needs Davos's advice proves that he always had some doubts about it.And yes, prisoners and criminals are people too, but in Stannis's case, to be honest, I don't remember why they were burnt at all. Let's remember that Melisandre is a big influence and burning people might have something to do with the Red God.
2937	The Scabbard Of the Morning	2013-05-20	Like I said, I'm a Stannis fan and I like this portrayal. I was convinced by the acting and dialogue that Stannis was conflicted, he did not want to do it, but felt like it was his duty to do it for the greater good.
2938	Nictarion	2013-05-20	I will NEVER in a million years understand the fandom that surrounds Stannis Baratheon.

Davos is the only redeeming part of his story.
2939	ThePrinceOfSunspear	2013-05-20	The scene with Davos was POINTLESS.
Immediately after that he went ahead and still let Melisandre eff with Gendry.
 I swear some of you are so delusional its scary. You'll defend this show to death and beyond despite the utter sh*t that is being shown on the television screen. That scene with Davos would have actually meant something if I dunno Stannis had LET GENDRY GO?
What is so hard to contemplate about what the opening poster said? That whole convo in the dungeons was absolutely stupid

2941	JonCon's Red Beard	2013-05-20	/agree.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':agree:' /> I am still waiting for the Stannis is the man moment. For me, it hasn't happened yet. Davos is the only redeeming part of his story.You don't need to have a big epic battle scene to prove you're "the man". Stannis understanding, due to Davos' advice, that he need to save the Realm he wanted to rule was more important than ruling it is his biggest moment of awesome. He went from "I have to be King because the rules says I'm the real heir" to realise that if he didn't save Westeros from the real danger, no one would.I love Dany but while her dragons might be quite helpful against the Others, she probably won't leave Essos until is too late. And every other lord, like the Tyrells and the Lannisters, are playing the Game of Thrones for their own convenience and have no idea what's happening beyond the Wall. Littlefinger and Varys who are playing a game themselves, are not even considering the threat that the Others are. So, who is thinking about the realm and all of the people that might die?
2942	ThePrinceOfSunspear	2013-05-20	Did you not here Mel say that it was Davos who wanted proof of her power (thus doing leeches instead of killing him right off).Gendry isn't dead yet, he can still be let go.I don't get why people like to call wolf with "character assassinations" so much.What does that have to do with anything?If Davos' opinion truly mattered to Stannis? IF the character of Stannis was even an iota of the "noble just" man that Davos and the show said he was he would have let Gendry go before "Leech on the Penis". PERIOD.Or you know the stupid writers could have had Davo smuggle him away somehow. But yeah the books don't exist in this bs world of HBOs so of course they had to get the "kings blood" somehow and Edric Storm aint happenin anytime soon...This show is pure sh*t.
2943	Ahri Adaran	2013-05-20	Maybe it's just me but I find show-Stannis to be infinitely more sympathetic than book Stannis. The outraged squawk about how the show isn't showing him PROPERLY as a protagonist on the TWoP boards just made me smile.
2944	Kienn	2013-05-20	You realize book Stannis let Edric get leeched too right and was even going to let him be sacrificed and it was Davos who saved him on his own to "protect my king from himself"?
Apparently book purist show haters don't even know their stuff...

2946	The Scabbard Of the Morning	2013-05-20	You realize that they aren't done with the storyline right? They will be other opportunities to show his conflict?
2947	W.Kane	2013-05-20	You realize that they aren't done with the storyline right? They will be other opportunities to show his conflict?no , there isn't enough time left , it was very vital for Stannis character and they ruined it , just like how they showed him like a lusty man ,flirting  with Mel !it is so obvious that D&D hate Stannis with passion. and it is very sad because he is one of the most interesting character in the books and they have ruined it. there is still time though , but they won't be able to fix this mess completely.
2948	The Scabbard Of the Morning	2013-05-20	How do you know there isn't enough time left?
2949	W.Kane	2013-05-20	How do you know there isn't enough time left?they can't show his conflict properly in two or three episodes , hell they just introduced Gendry to him and a lot have happened  in only one episode . Gendry should have been introduced to him from episode one . I know that was impossible , that's why I think they needed to introduce Edric.my problem is not just this , they have altered his personality.anyway I really hope they fix this mess , I really do.
2950	Kienn	2013-05-20	Rabid Stannis fans man... there's no talking sense to them.
2951	TomBadgerlock	2013-05-20	Stannis is in my top three favourite characters in the books and I was perfectly fine with his scenes today. In fact, I thought the scene did a good job of explaining why Davos is held in such a high regard by Stannis.
I also liked the "great battle in the snow" prediction from Stannis.
2952	Darth Zyroth	2013-05-20	I wish E-Ro was here.

Because his internal conflict over burning Edric was only in Davos IV and Davos V. There's no accurate way to judge how much time has passed in Dragonstone, and exactly how long Stannis has been pondering burning the boy.
2955	SerMudz	2013-05-20	I will NEVER in a million years understand the fandom that surrounds Stannis Baratheon. It really does boggle my mind.And I will NEVER understand those who don't love Stannis and see what an epic, fantastically written and conceived character he is - it really does boggle my mind.
2956	Pinkie Baelish	2013-05-20	I originally thought Dillane was acting too thuggish in this episode, but the more I watch the scene, the more it strikes me that Stannis is trying to convince himself that burning Gendry is the right thing to do. On a subconscious level, I think that's why he acts so overly callous when talking about it to Davos. He wants Davos to object and tell him that it's the wrong thing to do, since he's too proud to admit it himself.
2957	StannisandDaeny	2013-05-20	I just have to say, that while I think its important to take the show and the book as two autonomous works of art, I am highly disatisfied with this simplified portrayal of Stannis. Whether or not you like him as a character in the books, he is far more complex and three-dimensional than he is in this television series. His immediate willingness to sacrifice Gendry was such a let down for me. There wasn't even a split second of conflict. Stannis was adamantly opposed to burning Edric initially and was only convinced when he believed there was absolutely no other option to save the kingdom. Here, Stannis has little to no regard for Gendry's life, and it just felt to me like the writers were purposely ignoring the source material in order to further establish him as villain. Unlike the books, where we have the proper space for us to contemplate Stannis' character and moral ambiguity, the series creates a narrow spectrum in which he can only be viewed as an entitled douchebag. If you're going to make deviations in a character arc, you should maintain the complexity of said characters, rather than simplify them in order to force you're own views down the throats of the audience.THANK YOU. Now I don't have to make this comment.Fucking bastards white-washing Tyrion and making Stannis into a douche...Rabid Stannis fans man... there's no talking sense to them.Rabid Stannis haters man... there's no talking sense to them.You realize book Stannis let Edric get leeched too right and was even going to let him be sacrificed and it was Davos who saved him on his own to "protect my king from himself"?Apparently book purist show haters don't even know their stuff...Piss on that. He opposed Mel rather than going along with it right away like he does here and his acceptance of Davos taking Edric away shows his true opinion on the matter. Nor was there any mention of Edric being fucking tied to a bed and screaming for help or even being a prisoner.

There's no accurate way to judge how much time has passed in Dragonstone, and exactly how long Stannis has been pondering burning the boy.in Davos IV the ritual of leeches happened and in Davos VI Stannis made his decision , so actually there are 3 chapters . the time gap between these chapters is huge.Davos doesn't get a lot of chapters like some POVs : Jon , Tyrion and Danny.  yes ,there is no accurate way but it was probably for months ,
	Spoiler  from the ritual of leeches till the death of the false kings which probably took months for three of them to die.

2959	Pyrrhus	2013-05-20	I will NEVER in a million years understand the fandom that surrounds Stannis Baratheon. It really does boggle my mind.When I read the books, I imagined Stannis saying those words, the "What's one bastard against the realm" much more sullenly. Soft and truly hard considered. In the show, he says it as though it's as clear as night and day. Gendry or the realm. I don't blame the show, I've come to accept that the show does not = the books about two seasons ago. But I do feel Stannis' character was done a dishonor. At the same time, we still have two more episodes, and potentially more episodes next season, so I'll save my judgement until at least the end of season four.
2960	Pyrrhus	2013-05-20	You have a valid point in that actors do not always play book characters as you would envision them being in your imagination....I thought thought that scene was pretty good....it would have made no sense for Stannis to try and spare a bastard child he doesn't know....but he does know it's wrong to kill innocent people....or else he wouldn't have gone to Davos....in the end he knew it was wrong and needed to be talked out of sacraficing Gendry....Stannis is about justice. Gendry, or Edric Storm, it makes little difference. The facts are, Gendry is no traitor, he did not raise an army to oppose Stannis, he did not conspire to keep the Lannisters on the throne. Stannis is about justice, and there is no justice in murdering a young adult. I felt the show's adaptation paled in comparison to the books. But we'll see.
2961	Calidad	2013-05-20	Stannis wasn't overly likeable in the books at this point either. He was grim, cold, almost emotionally devoid. It wasn't really until he intervened in the battle at the Wall did 'warmer' sides of his character start to show.
I think the show is doing a good job in his portrayal thus far.
2962	sati	2013-05-20	I actually like Stannis better in the show. It's possible it's all because of Stephen Dillane. That scene with Davos was one of the best moments of the episode.
2963	Im With Stannis	2013-05-20	I will NEVER in a million years understand the fandom that surrounds Stannis Baratheon. It really does boggle my mind.BOO!!! I don't think this really ruined his character. He still has internal conflict about burning Gendry, which is why he brought up the subject to him at all. Did Tywin bring up the RW to Tyrion? But if they go through with burning Gendry and veer from the books, I'll throw my computer into my tv.
2964	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2013-05-20	BOO!!!I don't think this really ruined his character. He still has internal conflict about burning Gendry, which is why he brought up the subject to him at all. Did Tywin bring up the RW to Tyrion?But if they go through with burning Gendry and veer from the books, I'll throw my computer into my tv.that would suck big time. Davos saving Edric is his best moment.
2965	Mulled Wino	2013-05-20	The sex scene was stupid.  
But im beginning to see the light at the end of his story.  Ive had to be patient, and as a huge stannis fan ive hated it so far, BUT I understand they cant make his character as complex onscreen.  No characters are.
2966	lannistergold	2013-05-20	I think part of the problem is the actor just not getting who Stannis is supposed to be. The leery expression of his as he talked about the need for the sacrifice made it a lot harder to swallow.
2967	Mulled Wino	2013-05-20	I think part of the problem is the actor just not getting who Stannis is supposed to be.

YES! There is pointless nudity and some other useless stuff instead of epic story telling but still.. but people are kind of missing things out that it is impossible to portray books with 100% accuracy on 10 episode(SEASON) TV-Show with huge cast of actors/characters.
Soon all there is some bitching how writing sucks and the hole show sucks. It's sad..

Was just about to post something similar to this in regards to how often the term "character assassination" seems to be popping. It really loses its luster after the first dozen times, haha. I never warmed to Stannis in the books. He's an interesting character but a lot of people seem to revere him in the fandom for some reason. I don't understand it but I don't begrudge it. I think they've done him justice with the time with the time they have been allotted. The only thing that's bothered me so far was when he was basically grinding against Melisandre when she was leaving Dragonstone but I've otherwise enjoyed what they've done with him.
2977	Kaitscralt	2013-05-20	There's going to be a huge turnaround for stannis' character.  I can feel itIt's already started.
2978	Ravi Seaworth	2013-05-20	torture porn, moral greyness, character assassination, mary sue, plot armor yada yada yadaAdd white-washing to the list. Personally, I have no problem with these discussions, assuming that people are doing it for fun. It is an interesting intellectual exercise to interpret a text in such a thorough way and find every single possible flaw with the adaptation. The real issue, here, is that a lot of people are slightly fanatic about the story in the books, such that, they take these discussions too seriously. This story is above all fiction and there is a world outside. Regarding Stannis, the only point in time where I really started to admire him was after his aid to the Night's Watch and his role in ADoD. Before that, I just respected him. That's why it is too premature to talk about "character assassination". In the show, he has been giving the impression of an ambitious man and slightly more religious than in the books. But this is a perfect opportunity to change viewer's opinions about him once he starts acting as the true Stannis. This is one of the many things that makes ASoIF so interesting.

2981	Mulled Wino	2013-05-20	It's already started.Its still subtle enough that im hoping that its a gut punch to tv viewers when it happens
2982	ser benjamin	2013-05-20	Book Stannis has plenty of questionable character choices.   For the longest time, Stannis reminded me of an Inspector Javert (Les Miserables). Totaly dedicated to honor and the Law regardless of circumstance or case. However, his willingness to legitimize a Bastard AND promote oath-breaking in order to consolidate power is much worse than trying to get a little good-bye action from Mel.    I like show Stannis more.   There. I said it.    He comes off as more conflicted about his roll as AA.... He clearly is not.  You get the feeling that he just might do the right thing because it is the right thing to do.... even if the "law" says otherwise.
2983	Mulled Wino	2013-05-20	Book Stannis has plenty of questionable character choices.   For the longest time, Stannis reminded me of an Inspector Javert (Les Miserables). Totaly dedicated to honor and the Law regardless of circumstance or case. However, his willingness to legitimize a Bastard AND promote oath-breaking in order to consolidate power is much worse than trying to get a little good-bye action from Mel.    I like show Stannis more.   There. I said it.    He comes off as more conflicted about his roll as AA.... He clearly is not.  You get the feeling that he just might do the right thing because it is the right thing to do.... even if the "law" says otherwise.everything stannis did there was legit and honorable.  Its within the power of a king and it was what would be best for the north and the realm.
2984	Tywin's bastard	2013-05-20	I just love the way the term "character assasination" has been popularized between GOT fans, after that infamous column. Cat, Loras, Sansa, Stannis...That was my first thought as well when I saw the name of this topic.It's even funnier that people complain about Stannis being simplified while they didn't even understand the fairly obvious scene with him and Davos. My theory is that some people get so hung up on things being exactly like the book that their comprehension and analytic abilities get diminished considerably.
2985	Gendels Children	2013-05-20	Stannis's sense of justice is shown through Davos. He is being portrayed as a tough guy because that is how he wants to be seen. The intimate scenes are where we get more of an insight into Stannis as a person. /agree.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':agree:' />
2986	Jamie Lannister	2013-05-20	I'm a big Stannis fan, and I'm not bothered by this episode at all. I feel his interactions with both the devil on his shoulder and the angel were a good way to showcase the great quandary of Stannis Baratheon.
2987	White Harbors Wrath	2013-05-20	I didn't know where to put this post, but figured it didn't warrant a new topic...Stannis: "You've slaughtered many lambs?"Mel: "And none have seen the blade.Clear foreshadowing that I either have forgotten from the books, didn't catch or it simply wasn't there. Is Mel going to kill Stannis in WoW?what on earth?
2988	ser benjamin	2013-05-20	not the worst idea... however i think it heavily relies on unproven arguments.  
First, AA has to be real.  He could be the PTWP as well (most earthly faiths have identical hero stories).
Second, Jon Snow has to fit the prophecy and Mel has to change her mind about Stannis for Jon
Third, Sacrificing him would have to have a purpose. If Mel (who.... side note, her high priest is preaching that Dany is AA..... is she rouge from ehr own church? or has she not gotten the email) thinks he isn't a king, or a savior, she has no use for him... She would have to do it as a part of a greater plan (like (f)Mance)  Even then, she might not actually kill Stannis (again, fake mance)
Finally, the idea that the show-writers are considering the end of the story while writing these scenes would have to be true.  
  Not saying any of this is wrong... I could be inclined to agree with all of these theories.
2989	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-20	He opposed Mel rather than going along with it right away like he does here and his acceptance of Davos taking Edric away shows his true opinion on the matter. Nor was there any mention of Edric being fucking tied to a bed and screaming for help or even being a prisoner.Stannis was conflicted with Mel, but ultimately, never made the decision to spare Edric's life.  It is as some folks are remembering a different story -- one in which noble Stannis made a decision to spare Edric, and Davos' action was unnecessary.  It seems very odd that some are judging Stannis' portrayal as flawed before the critical scene has even occured.

Christ, if Stannis was as great as his fans seem to think he is, he should have put a stop to that shit immediately!I think the scene just reinforced what I've felt all along: The best thing about Stannis is Davos.

2994	Kienn	2013-05-20	Rabid Stannis haters man... there's no talking sense to them.Good example, calling someone with a neutral opinion of Stannis a hater, lol.You guys are saying the show is terrible and represents Stannis badly because it doesn't show his "turmoil" over sacrificing Gendry/Edric(even though it did... and he wasn't even sacrificed). I have no doubt that if they showed Stannis taking 2 or 3 or 4 episodes deciding the same thing you would just complain that they're depicting him as an indecisive moron.
2995	lostinwesteros	2013-05-20	Add white-washing to the list. Personally, I have no problem with these discussions, assuming that people are doing it for fun. It is an interesting intellectual exercise to interpret a text in such a thorough way and find every single possible flaw with the adaptation. The real issue, here, is that a lot of people are slightly fanatic about the story in the books, such that, they take these discussions too seriously. This story is above all fiction and there is a world outside. Regarding Stannis, the only point in time where I really started to admire him was after his aid to the Night's Watch and his role in ADoD. Before that, I just respected him. That's why it is too premature to talk about "character assassination". In the show, he has been giving the impression of an ambitious man and slightly more religious than in the books. But this is a perfect opportunity to change viewer's opinions about him once he starts acting as the true Stannis. This is one of the many things that makes ASoIF so interesting.This is a great point!Personally, though, I think the Mel/Gendry scene was ridiculous, pointless, and /ack.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':ack:' /> .  Salacious.
2996	Mr Hodor	2013-05-20	i think some people will never be satisfied. Not with stannis' potrayl atleast

2997	JoramunsKazoo	2013-05-20	I believe Donal Noye said it best. "Stannis is pure iron, black and hard and strong, yes, but brittle, the way iron gets. He'll break before he bends."
Toss in a heaping tablespoon of duty and justice and that about sums up Stannis.
2998	Kaitscralt	2013-05-20	I am a huge book fan of Stannis, by the way. Arguably my favorite (living) character along with Davos.
The only Stannis scene so far that I have had an issue with was the beach scene where Mel leaves, but since then there has only been great character development that is true to book Stannis -- at least, nothing worth nitpicking over.
2999	Mulled Wino	2013-05-20	He killed his real brother with a shadow baby demon assassin. He shouldn't have much of a problem burning a bastard kid.did he?  I thought Mel did that.

3001	Lord of Castamere	2013-05-20	And so the heroes fall.. I think the show is giving us a more humane view of Stannis. No one in real life can be as one dimensional as book Stannis.
3002	The Mondrian Oak	2013-05-20	Yes how could i forget white washing! Don't get the Stannis thing either but then again I don't get any of the people who are committed to one character.You brought up Mary Sue though. I had totally forgotten about it, and I laughed out loud!
3003	WTFSalami	2013-05-20	did he?  I thought Mel did that.Two to tango.
3004	WhatIsDeadMayNeverLive	2013-05-20	Is it just me or was the actor playing Stannis doing a half-smile while talking? Book Stannis was serious and grim, TV Stannis just seems arrogant to me.
3005	Kienn	2013-05-20	Yea believing you're the one true god personified isn't arrogant at all...
3006	congokong	2013-05-20	Who convinces Stannis to go to the Wall? Who convinces Stannis to leave Mel behind at Blackwater? Who convinces Stannis to go the Hill Clansemen and not the Dreadfort? Etc... Book Stannis is always listening to good council from honest men. Mostly Davos and later Jon Snow.He's always been someone who needs a push in the right direction.It's different here. Stannis can be swayed, but in that scene he is saying one thing but wants another. If he truly did not agree he would just say so, unafraid to speak his mind. Book Stannis was always direct, never doing double talk. This "what are you waiting for, get on with it" and then running to Davos to change his mind is not the mentality of book Stannis.
3007	Oakenfist	2013-05-20	this.they are ruining his character and people who disagree are either non book readers or they don't like or understand Stannis.it took exactly half of ASOS for him to ultimately consider sacrificing Edric , half of ASOS!!!he refused Mel multiple times . he was suffering for half a book to make the right decision , agonizing moments of doubt , dilemmas and conflictions  of  priorities .it was the hardest decision , he had ever made.you can see some of these quotes that explain it:  -------------------------------------<U+0093>I have told you, no.<U+0094><U+0093>He is only one baseborn boy, against all the boys of Westeros, and all the girls as well. Against all the children that might ever be born, in all the kingdoms of the world.<U+0094><U+0093>The boy is innocent.<U+0094><U+0093>The boy defiled your marriage bed, else you would surely have sons of your own. He shamed you.<U+0094><U+0093>Robert did that. Not the boy. My daughter has grown fond of him. And he is mine own blood.<U+0094><U+0093>Your brother<U+0092>s blood,<U+0094> Melisandre said. <U+0093>A king<U+0092>s blood. Only a king<U+0092>s blood can wake the stone dragon.<U+0094>Stannis ground his teeth. <U+0093>I<U+0092>ll hear no more of this.------------------------------------------<U+0093>Edric -<U+0094> he started.<U+0093> - is one boy! He may be the best boy who ever drew breath and it would not matter. My duty is to the realm.<U+0094> His hand swept across the Painted Table. <U+0093>How many boys dwell in Westeros? How many girls? How many men, how many women? The darkness will devour them all, she says. The night that never ends. She talks of prophecies... a hero reborn in the sea, living dragons hatched from dead stone... she speaks of signs and swears they point to me. I never asked for this, no more than I asked to be king. Yet dare I disregard her?<U+0094> He ground his teeth. <U+0093>We do not choose our destinies. Yet we must... we must do our duty, no? Great or small, we must do our duty.-----------------------------------------------------<U+0093>Your Grace,<U+0094> said Davos, <U+0093>the cost. .<U+0093>I know the cost! Last night, gazing into that hearth, I saw things in the flames as well. I saw a king, a crown of fire on his brows, burning... burning, Davos. His own crown consumed his flesh and turned him into ash. Do you think I need Melisandre to tell me what that means? Or you?<U+0094>------------------------------------------<U+0093>I never asked for this crown. Gold is cold and heavy on the head, but so long as I am the king, I have a duty... If I must sacrifice one child to the flames to save a million from the dark... Sacrifice... is never easy, Davos. Or it is no true sacrifice."------------------------------------------Seek help. This show isn't going to spend half a season with Stannis thinking about killing Gendry. I cant believe youre even suggesting such a thing. Be realistic and pull your head out of Stannis' ass.

3008	WhatIsDeadMayNeverLive	2013-05-20	Yea believing you're the one true god personified isn't arrogant at all...I'm far from a Stannis fan and believe he has many negative traits, but in the books he was never arrogant, not like in the show.http://www.youtube.c...h?v=N7g6lIyWzrAWatch from 3:35 on. This is NOT Stannis.
3009	Sand11751	2013-05-20	Stannis is a self-righteous prig. He only sees things his way. For him, there can only be one butt warming the Iron Throne - his. And he'll deal with shadow babies, leeches and whatever else to achieve that single-minded purpose. I could almost admire his tenacity if it hadn't led to some of the more awful events in the war between kings.

"What is one bastard against a kingdom [smile]?"I was rooting for Renly in WotFK and hated Stannis so much in the second book I rooted for Joff in the battle of Blackwater, but this is not how Stannis would act and talk. The man never smiled and now he is smiling when talking about sacrificing his nephew? Just no.

The man never smiled and now he is smiling when talking about sacrificing his nephew? Just no.This is exactly why I was turned off to the scene initially. That fucking smile. The stoicism of the character has been replaced by arrogance. How can I connect with this internal conflict, this boiling inner turmoil within Stannis as to whether or not he should sacrifice and innocent for the greater good if he's wearing this cocky smile and talking about this serious dilemma in such a nonchalant way? It's been brought up that Stannis is playing devil's advocate because he wants Davos to argue for mercy, but I think this could have been handled better. And also the whole "tavern slut" line felt a little out of character. Not that Stannis is anykind of feminist, but he also doesn't normally go out of his way to degrade women either. I can't help but feel that the unyielding stoicism has been layered with one too many sprinkles of dickishness, and its made him harder to enjoy as a character.

3012	jmk51	2013-05-20	It's amusing that everyone suspends everything they know about society to try to figure out what's "moral" and "just" about a place that's all about the strong over the weak, and bizarre hereditary laws.  Feudalism - not cool.
3013	mediterraneo	2013-05-20	I just have to say, that while I think its important to take the show and the book as two autonomous works of art, I am highly disatisfied with this simplified portrayal of Stannis. Whether or not you like him as a character in the books, he is far more complex and three-dimensional than he is in this television series. His immediate willingness to sacrifice Gendry was such a let down for me. There wasn't even a split second of conflict. Stannis was adamantly opposed to burning Edric initially and was only convinced when he believed there was absolutely no other option to save the kingdom. Here, Stannis has little to no regard for Gendry's life, and it just felt to me like the writers were purposely ignoring the source material in order to further establish him as villain. Unlike the books, where we have the proper space for us to contemplate Stannis' character and moral ambiguity, the series creates a narrow spectrum in which he can only be viewed as an entitled douchebag. If you're going to make deviations in a character arc, you should maintain the complexity of said characters, rather than simplify them in order to force you're own views down the throats of the audience.Well, I'm a notorious Stannis hater and (Jaime) Lannister fanboy in the books threads.Here I come to say that, since episode 3x05, I start understanding Stannis a bit more, his TV self and his book self as well.It is something about it similar to what happened me with Cersei. Some simplification in the TV show helped me to notice details that were always there in the books as well.I'm still a Stannis hater, but now... Well, i felt piety for him, and the quiet horrors of the familiar life he lives, alone. Everybody would end up seeing things in the fire, living like that. Maybe not everybody would burn people for that, but that's a completely different matter.No, I definitely don't feel Stannis is plain and has been "character assassinated" in the tv show.

The man never smiled and now he is smiling when talking about sacrificing his nephew? Just no.Stannis is adopting a nonchalent attitude at first because he is in fact uncomfortable with the situation in which he's and Davos knows that. It's a normal human reaction, when you're unconfortable with something you try sometimes to show the opposite. He's no more smilling that way when Davos is speaking to him, he even seems affected by his words.
3016	JonCon's Red Beard	2013-05-20	And so the heroes fall.. I think the show is giving us a more humane view of Stannis. No one in real life can be as one dimensional as book Stannis.We don't have his pov to know how conflicted he's inside about everything, we only see four people's pov about him: Mel, who thinks he's a god reborn (literally, almost), Jon, who is probably the most neutral, Davos, who despite what people think, is not completely biased because he knows that the reason Stannis wants him around is because he has doubts and Maester Cressen, who has known him since he was a child.Stannis is a man who projects a image and people - even readers - judge him based on that image: severe, plain, stubborn. But Maester Cresser knew he is a man who has been hurt a lot; Davos knows that while he's fair, he feels conflicted about big decisions and those are the men who know him the most. Mel, otoh, doesn't know him that well.

3018	gibbles545	2013-05-20	They have got the Davos interactions with Stannis quite well, except for him being named hand in season 2 rather than after Davos defies Stannis to save Edric/Gendry.
Whereas to me the Stannis and Melisandre scenes have been more of a disapointment, with him coming of as more emotionaly attached to Melisandre than the book Stannis.
Despite this I liked the episode thought his internal struggle came of quite well, although I will miss his quite about his claim to the iron throne and it not being a question of wanting it but of duty.

There's nothing about him having a duty to become king for the sake of his daughter, (though this could come later) lines that gave him a benevolent edge. I realize one can interpret Stannis as being a slighted, delusional man in the original text, but there is room in the original source material, and plenty of evidence to suggest otherwise, whereas I can't help but feel when I'm watching that Stannis is an entitled asshole who doesn't care about the fate of the realm so much as his own selfish desires.

3020	Dragonstoned	2013-05-20	Thought this episode went some way to redeeming Stannis's moral character? By having Davos say that Stannis believes the same as him.The problems with the scene were i) Stephen Dillane's portrayal which is much less good in s3 than it was in s2 - his delivery is often leery and he doesn't come across as detached enough or 'iron'-like, and ii) that his faith in R'hllor is exaggerated, asking how Davos can deny the Red God is real, while Davos's faith in the Seven is strangely underplayed with him supposing parents made up the gods to make their children feel safe.Also wanted the 'What is the life of one bastard boy against a kingdom?' -- 'Everything'.
3021	Mulled Wino	2013-05-20	Two to tango.when did they tango and plot this in the books, maybe im misremembering..

Something like "it's my turn, it's the rules, so I shall be King because it's said so". So, I guess having that impression watching or portraying Stannis in that way, BEFORE he realises how important is to save Westeros from the real danger in the North, wouldn't be completely inaccurate.

The scene was good but it's as if they don't show him conflicted at all in doing that...

How exactly did he save thousands at Storm's End? If you are reffering to a certain assassination of a certain brother, then let me tell you that it had NOTHING to do with saving lives. Stannis was pretty much an a-hole along these lines at that point:"I'm the king, it's my right and I will kill anyone who dare oppose me and do anything to sit IT."Only when he lost the war did he remember that a king's duty is to the realm, not to himself...

So, I guess having that impression watching or portraying Stannis in that way, BEFORE he realises how important is to save Westeros from the real danger in the North, wouldn't be completely inaccurate.Same here... but when I reread the books, he became one of my favorite.. they should have let him stayed in the book as he is... Somehow Show Stannis feel kinda common for me.. In the books, he's very different and complex..
3030	Joyful Union	2013-05-20	ok, so how is that worse than what other contenders did in the war?Well, the brutal death march kind of shows an ill-advised and devil may care attitude towards his own troops. Particularly when he started burning men who forced to turn to cannabalism due to the march he started. But I suppose it's not much worse than what other leaders have done in the war.
3031	JaTyAdo	2013-05-20	Excuse me? How exactly did he save thousands at Storm's End? If you are reffering to a certain assassination of a certain brother, then let me tell you that it had NOTHING to do with saving lives. Stannis was pretty much an a-hole along these lines at that point:"I'm the king, it's my right and I will kill anyone who dare oppose me and do anything to sit IT."Only when he lost the war did he remember that a king's duty is to the realm, not to himself...So does all the contenders for the throne.. and Renly was a bigger ass about it, like he had a claim to the throne.. Dany also think her Targaryen blood would give her a right to the throne, now we're off to Joffrey who is a sadistic, stupid, little kid who also has no claim at all..That kind of feeling is common to all kings..

So, I guess having that impression watching or portraying Stannis in that way, BEFORE he realises how important is to save Westeros from the real danger in the North, wouldn't be completely inaccurate.As I said, it's one possible interpretation. I didn't see him that way, though I think we can all agree that Stannis has a large character shift when he makes the decision to save the Wall for the good of the realm. He says himself that during this period he could think only of his claim and that he needed to be reminded of his duty by Davos. Still, I do feel that this stoic aspect of his character has been underplayed, and I don't think it needed to be replaced with arrogance in order to establish that Stannis has fallen temporarily down the wrong path.
3033	Ramsay Gimp	2013-05-20	Guys, this is Stannis's lowest and darkest moment in the books as well. Lower than killing Renly. It makes his subsequent rescue of the Wall all the more dramatic and awesome.
3034	WhatIsDeadMayNeverLive	2013-05-20	So does all the contenders for the throne.. and Renly was a bigger ass about it, like he had a claim to the throne.. Dany also think her Targaryen blood would give her a right to the throne, now we're off to Joffrey who is a sadistic, stupid, little kid who also has no claim at all..That kind of feeling is common to all kings..True, but only one of them murdered his brother and considered killing his nephew to win. Renly was power-hungry, but in his mind so was Stannis. He thought Joff was legitimate after all. He rebelled against the Lannister, same as Robb. Why should he support another rebel with a weak (or so he thought) claim and even weaker army?I have a feeling we are getting out of topic so bottom line is, Stannis was, at least for me, a villan at this point in the books, but he was not the kind of person he is on the show.
3035	JonCon's Red Beard	2013-05-20	thats what every contender in the books does.  Why is stannis singled out?  He should be singled out because he is the only one who ends up fighting for the good of the realm.At the beginning of the 5KW?Joffrey wasn't fighting, he was defending his throne, the one he believe to be really his own, as he was "the real son" of Robert's.Robb wasn't fighting for the throne.Renly wanted to be King... because.Balon Greyjoy... no, I don't know what the hell happened there.I won't mention the Targaryens who are in Essos, but Varys kinda got it right: one thing is to rule because it's your right, another, because it's your duty. Stannis wanted to be King because it was his right, and then he understood that it was his duty to save Westeros, because no one else was even thinking about it. He could have been like Littlefinger, let the kingdom get burn (or frozen) and then being the king of ashes (or frost) and appear like the One Saviour, but he went up to the North, to fight a war that doesn't directly involve him (he could say, "well, it's the North's job to protect us, isn't?") in order to save the lives of those he intend to be rule..

The plot has to move along, so these aspects get simplified. Like they have been for most characters. The show is not the book and doesn't have to parrot every single line. They show him regreting Renly's death to a degree, they show him being conflicted about Gendry, that's enough for me.
3043	Head of The Ned	2013-05-20	Stannis and Davos' exchange was great, exactly like something out of the books. I don't see how this is character assassination I just think some of you need to realize how limiting a TV adaptation is for a series as massive as this one. That or you just have sand in your vaginas.
3044	wolverine	2013-05-20	/agree.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':agree:' /> I am still waiting for the Stannis is the man moment. For me, it hasn't happened yet. Davos is the only redeeming part of his story.I didn't know there were big Stannis fans.  He is not a bad character, just not one who seems like he would attract fans.  Davos is pretty awesome though.
3045	WardenOfTheNerds	2013-05-20	The worst out of character line this season is easily the horny Stannis on the beach. I hated that scene so much.
3046	poggo	2013-05-20	The worst out of character line this season is easily the horny Stannis on the beach. I hated that scene so much.Indeed... needy, leghumping Stannis on the beach was horrible. /sleep.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt='-_-' />But in this episode, he was really good.Some people see "Character Assasination" just about anywere...
3047	Dogs	2013-05-20	Just throwing this out there, but I feel like Show Stannis is visibly more complex than Book Stannis. For instance, the fact that Book Stannis "never smiles" and never ever laughs at jokes is more one-sided than Stannis in the show, who is visibly conflicted and awkward and confused about how to proceed his war. He got a little frisky with Mellisandre on the beach, but he was at a very weak point, and then he later confessed his guilt about it to his wife. Isn't that a sign of complexity? I think Stephane Dillane's acting is superb, how socially awkward he is with people. He kind of shuffles down to the dungeons, uncertain about what to say to Davos, so Davos says it for him. And the same thing with his daughter, too, how he just kind of goes up and says hi, and then doesn't really have anything important to tell her or say to her, but it's still kind of obvious he does feel some sort of affinity or attachment to her but just has no idea how to express it.
I think the show has done a good job communicating that Stannis is really in a conflicted, stagnated state at this point in his life, with his gnarly beard and his wanderings around the castle visiting his family who he hasn't bothered talking to in a long time, and his wanting Mellisandre on the beach, and also, most recently in the latest episode, the piles of unopened letters on the table in his meeting room when they bring Gendry in. I thought that was a really cool detail that showed him not wanting to really deal with the responsibilities and the struggles of the real world of fighting a war.
Also, does anyone know why Stannis says "Joffrey Baratheon" instead of "Joffrey Lannister" when he throws Joffrey's leech on the fire? He's a stickler for proper titles supposedly, so I can't explain why he does that when Joffrey is not a Baratheon. It's in the book too.

It's in the book too.I don't know why, but he says "Joffrey Baratheon" in the books too. "Joffrey Lannister" wouldn't be correct because he's a bastard, but he can't be called "Joffrey Waters" because he is not officially recognized as a bastard. I honestly don't know how he should be called, maybe just "Joffrey"?
3053	Martin Lasarte	2013-05-20	What infamous column?I was refering to this column, in which the author said:A second episode monologue by Catelyn Stark (Michelle Fairley), about her relationship with her late husband<U+0080><U+0099>s bastard Jon Snow (Kit Harington), is particularly head-scratching, almost tantamount to outright character assassination.Elio and Linda mentioned it in a couple of their own reviews, and then everyone else started using the term.

It's funny how Dany and Stannis always seem to worm their ways into each other's threads though.
3059	JonCon's Red Beard	2013-05-21	Stannis lusting over Mel did bother me at first, but to be honest, do we know what Stannis thinks of her in books?As pointed out above, he was at his lowest in that scene: he returned from a battle he not only lost, but also caused his people to abandon him, the death of his most loyal man (he thought so) and to have the whole kingdom laughing at him. Then, he knew he would return home, when a crazy wife was waiting for him. Stannis is a man who has been denied many things: his parents died when he was very young, he never had a male heir but a girl that, while lovely, is sick, his older brother preferred his younger brother instead of him and while he always tries to do the right thing and being fair, people don't like him. And then, this hot bwitch arrives, with promises and prophecies that favour him, and her magic does work. Yet, his own wife says "I have no problem with you sleeping with him". As a man, wouldn't he feel a bit... ignored hearing this? Because he did felt guilty about desiring her, he confess and Selyse says "yeah, whatever": that would break my heart. Melisandre, otoh, whatever are his intentions, makes him believe that she supports him and follows him no matter what. No wonder he didn't want her to leave, I wouldn't.

They're people who haven't known love for mostly of their lives, and while they are good people, in the way to be proclaimed King or Queen, have taken very morally ambiguous decisions and at the end, they "postponed" their plans to take the IT for something that they realised it was more important.
3062	Pinkie Baelish	2013-05-21	I really disliked Stannis and Mel's scene in the beach a few weeks ago, but Bryan Cogman's explanation of it made me feel better about it. He said that Mel is pretty much like an addiction to Stannis that's corrupted him. At his lowest point, he clings on to her like an addict seeking relief, which stresses the narcotic effect she has over him. I guess this was their main intent with the scene, but it instead came off as Stannis being horny.
3063	Nictarion	2013-05-21	They both are very similar.

3070	Versiroth	2013-05-21	The fact that Stannis went to Davos, knowing Davos would try to talk him out of it shows that he doesn't really want to burn the boy.   To me, he came off as a person who feels stuck with a hard choice that he thinks he has to make.   He brings in Davos to gain another perspective.   And in the books, he ends up completely willing to burn Edric in the end.  They're just having to speed things up a bit for the show.
Honestly, I loved the scene between Stannis and Davos.  Instead of Stannis coming off as trying to argue his side, it was more like he was playing devil's advocate.
3071	Versiroth	2013-05-21	I know forumers don't particularly keep character and personality in mind while discussing Stannis, like ever, but come on, Stannis does not show horniness like he did in that beach scene.And the TV Stannis isn't rigid enough.

I figured it was more a desperation move to have Mel produce another shadow son.

They show him regreting Renly's death to a degree, they show him being conflicted about Gendry, that's enough for me.This would make sense, except we've had more Stannis mentions of Renly in the show than by this stage in the books.Don't see the need to write their own lines for Stannis when there is a perfectly good script already in existence, although I agree his conflictedness about Gendry was well done in the last episode.

3073	Cadiva	2013-05-21	You forgot to mention "misogynistic", "male gaze" and "butchered"And God forbid that we should fail to mention having a character's "agency" taken away from them.
3074	RottenAppleFossoway	2013-05-21	I just have to say, that while I think its important to take the show and the book as two autonomous works of art, I am highly disatisfied with this simplified portrayal of Stannis. Whether or not you like him as a character in the books, he is far more complex and three-dimensional than he is in this television series. His immediate willingness to sacrifice Gendry was such a let down for me. There wasn't even a split second of conflict. Stannis was adamantly opposed to burning Edric initially and was only convinced when he believed there was absolutely no other option to save the kingdom. Here, Stannis has little to no regard for Gendry's life, and it just felt to me like the writers were purposely ignoring the source material in order to further establish him as villain. Unlike the books, where we have the proper space for us to contemplate Stannis' character and moral ambiguity, the series creates a narrow spectrum in which he can only be viewed as an entitled douchebag. If you're going to make deviations in a character arc, you should maintain the complexity of said characters, rather than simplify them in order to force you're own views down the throats of the audience.Stannis, both on screen and in written form is committed to one thing and one thing only:His duty. Not entitlement, not Mel, not power. Duty and nothing more. The scene where he went to release Davos illustrated his sense of duty perfectly.  I'm a Stannis fan and a Dillane fan and a fan of his portrayal. The only scene that seemed contrary to book Stannis, to me, was the beach scene with Mel this season, and even that only served to illustrate that he's human. Humans are all flawed, even rigid, dutiful Stannis Baratheon. The one true king of Westeros.
3075	Toxspecific	2013-05-21	How do you know it was him being "horny"?  I figured it was more a desperation move to have Mel produce another shadow son.Because the real Stannis wouldn't appear outwardly horny, he'd just say 'We must fornicate again' (something along the lines of that). And as for his motives, I'm already sure what they are in the context of Book Stannis, but to judge what they are for Show Stannis I think needs a few more scenes.Overall Show Stannis is good, but two glaringly bad scenes have tainted him badly.
3076	Penguin king	2013-05-21	Stannis, both on screen and in written form is committed to one thing and one thing only:His duty. Not entitlement, not Mel, not power.Duty and nothing more.Wrong. Before his Davos pursuaded him to defend the wall from the wildlings Stannis was very much driven by his sense entitlement. His 'right'  to be king is perhaps his primary motivation He even admits as much himself "Lord Seaworth is a man of humble birth, but he reminded me of my duty, when all I could think of was my rights. I had the cart before the horse, Davos said."
3077	Mammothsbane	2013-05-21	I was disappointed with how they handled the burning. Stannis didn't even seem conflicted about it.. until he went to see Davos. The show has made him much more into Red Raloo than he is in the books. I blame the lack of Axell Florent and Queen's Men.I had a problem with the beach scene until I saw the Gendry/Mel scene in episode eight, then I totally understood what Stannis was worried about losing.lol
3078	JonCon's Red Beard	2013-05-21	Because the real Stannis wouldn't appear outwardly horny, he'd just say 'We must fornicate again' (something along the lines of that).LOL, that would have been very funny to see and hear."Don't go, we must fornicate and produce a new shadow".Wrong. Before his Davos pursuaded him to defend the wall from the wildlings Stannis was very much driven by his sense entitlement. His 'right'  to be king is perhaps his primary motivation He even admits as much himself"Lord Seaworth is a man of humble birth, but he reminded me of my duty, when all I could think of was my rights. I had the cart before the horse, Davos said."Damn, I didn't remember that he said that line when I was explaining Stannis's change. I just remembered that Varys said it about (f)Aegon. Interesting that both Davos and Varys share the same opinion about what a king should be, being both characters who are known for have committed crimes in their past lives. We know Tommen's family think right is before duty, what about Jon and Dany?

He'd hint at it, uneasily, in broken sentences, and Mel would understand and say fuck yes.I know, but it does sound like something Stannis would say, and it would sound so funny and awkward to watch. "It's time to fornicate in order to save the realm". Pretty much like Mel with Gendry, "let's fuck to help me save the realm". These people are terrible with picking lines, no wonder they have arranged marriages /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />

I had the cart before the horse, Davos said." Ah nice catch! I stand corrected. I've read neither Clash nor Storm in some time now.The throne is Stannis' by all the inheritance rights of Westeros. It was his duty to seize it both by his right and for the good of the seven kingdoms. Now that he's been reminded by Davos, err that is was reminded 3 books and 13 years or so ago, what is it that motivates Stannis? Why his sense of duty of course. As he said just in this episode. He didn't ask for it. But he must do his duty.  Funny enough, I couldn't stand the character in Clash of Kings, warmed to him a bit in Storm of Swords and genuinely like and want him to win in the end as of a Dance with Dragons... Though I don't think he will sadly.

3084	The Key Is Patchface	2013-05-21	I just have to say, that while I think its important to take the show and the book as two autonomous works of art, I am highly disatisfied with this simplified portrayal of Stannis. Whether or not you like him as a character in the books, he is far more complex and three-dimensional than he is in this television series. His immediate willingness to sacrifice Gendry was such a let down for me. There wasn't even a split second of conflict. Stannis was adamantly opposed to burning Edric initially and was only convinced when he believed there was absolutely no other option to save the kingdom. Here, Stannis has little to no regard for Gendry's life, and it just felt to me like the writers were purposely ignoring the source material in order to further establish him as villain. Unlike the books, where we have the proper space for us to contemplate Stannis' character and moral ambiguity, the series creates a narrow spectrum in which he can only be viewed as an entitled douchebag. If you're going to make deviations in a character arc, you should maintain the complexity of said characters, rather than simplify them in order to force you're own views down the throats of the audience.Stannis was complex in the books?

That's as noble as anything else.As far as the treatment of Stannis goes, I didn't like him much at the start of the books. He's intentionally NOT a likable guy. He know it, everyone else knows it. Robert was likable, Renly was likable. Stannis is not. But Stannis is very respectable, if stubborn and unyielding. That doesn't make for a very fun guy, but grit is cool if it's legitimate. In Stannis's case he's got more grit than anything else.It wasn't until he went off to war in the north that I gave him adequate credit. He unquestionably is trying to protect the realm as his sworn and righteous duty. His take would be that the usurpers are getting in the way of that and putting the whole damned realm at risk. At least he backs it up with action.

3099	Draco_Dracul	2013-05-21	Why his sense of duty of course. As he said just in this episode. He didn't ask for it. But he must do his duty.Except in doing his duty he ensured the crown would stay on the head of a claimless king and that the realm would remain divided.  The man with the best chance of uniting the realm was his brother Renly.  Had he abandoned his right as king he could have better served his duty to the realm.Ironically, Show Stannis may actually be the more dutiful version as he is never linked to Jon Arryn's investigation (and it's implied that he only found out because of Ned), thus didn't abandon his brother and king while knowing Robert had no true born children.
3100	Anarchosaurus Rex	2013-05-21	Stannis is clearly conflicted. That is why he released Davos. True, he was not as opposed to sacrificing Gendry/Edric as he was in SoS, but the doubt was still there.

Yes, Stannis fleeing kings landing in the books was my biggest gripe against him actually. He should have gone straight to Robert but fled, likely in fear for his and his families life. It's understandable from a reality point of view, but it's something that really goes against the character.  I disagree with the bit about Renly. Renly had no claim. He committed outright treason against both the realm and Stannis. He died, deservedly so for it. Perhaps not in a manner fitting the brother of the king, but that was a means to an end. Same goes for the Tyrells and Randyll Tarly. All of their heads should be on spikes for treason.  Keep in mind that the only reason Stannis lost at the Blackwater was because of the continued treason of Lord Mace Tyrell and his alliance with the Lannisters. Had that alliance not happened, Joffrey, Cersei and Tyrion's heads would all be on spikes. And rightly so.

Renly had zero experience as a general and only say 2-3 proven commanders at best.  If renly sided with stannis they would havs had a far better chance.numbers dont always win.

If you're going to make deviations in a character arc, you should maintain the complexity of said characters, rather than simplify them in order to force you're own views down the throats of the audience. Stannis is damn near my favorite character, and though I agree with most of your assessments, I remember myself that I didnt really like Stannis myself until he reaches the Wall which hasnt even happened yet in the TV series.Stannis is undergoing a substantial change, just like many of the other important characters like Jaime, Sandor and Tyrion.Sure he is still stubborn and lukewarm at times, but his overall better qualities of justice and willingness to go against the odds prove to be his redeeming qualities as the books start to get darker and more desperate. I am probably wrong, but I think that GRRM wanted us to think that Stannis was a fraud for the first few books, but now that the sht is hitting the fan, we are starting to see that maybe there really is something special about him and that he is undrgoing his own transformation into (I hope) Azor Ahai.
3104	chris999	2013-05-21	Stannis suffered from some serious character assassination as well.  His sense of justice, though harsh, has been wiped away.  He resisted burning Edric in the books for a long time because the boy had done nothing wrong.  I think Melisandre would have convinced him eventually but it's a disservice to his character that he's not shown struggling with it more.  I guess you can say he is by releasing Davos from jail because he knows Davos can talk him out of it.  But even that moment where Davos lets Edric go and convinces Stannis to go to The Wall might lose its importance.I think that this is just one of the things that have to happen when translating a book onto screen. They have much less time and have to go over content quickly in order to keep the action flowing.One of the casualties we are seeing is that the TV series doesnt show the half dozen chapters after the defeat at Blackwater when Stannis was in dispair and doubting himself for weeks inside his tower at Dragonstone, mulling his defeat. What I am trying to say is that the desperation really is there and he feels that he has no choice at this point in the story except to use Mel's powers if he is ever to have a chance of winning the throne. We just dont get to see it because the producers had more important stuff to cover with other characters.As a Stannis fan, I dont like it, but I understand the limitations and I love the show anyway. I think they are really trying, and I am hoping that they will redeem him in the coming seasons as his story starts to get very interesting.
3105	Toxspecific	2013-05-21	I, as the Lord of Storm's End, formally agree to the idea of a Stannismoot. And my vote goes to E-ro /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />
Anyway, one complaint I have against Stannis in the show is that he.... Hard to explain; moves too much? His outlook isn't rigid enough. In the books I always see him as standing tall above the others, hands behind his back, dishing out one liners as if its no big deal. lol. Show Stannis needs to be less emotional. Even though he is pretty rigid, but still.
As for people saying Stannis not being a complex character, well I won't dismiss it as ridiculous as I do with other criticisms of Stannis (for example, the political ones which are often mind numbingly irrational), because its sort of true; compared to Jaime or Theon Stannis is not that complex, because the rigidity and firmness in his character lends him a sort of, well, uniformity of person. As in, he has a set personality and you can expect him to act in a number of ways. He isn't an enigma at all.
Good characters need not be complex in the context we're using the word; all GRRM's characters are good, but if all of them were complex to the level of Theon or someone, that would bring down the fun of reading those particular chapters. What complexity Stannis does have is a basic sort; you need to know his past to know why he is as he is, and once you study it a bit it's pretty damn easy to figure out.
3106	Draco_Dracul	2013-05-21	How do you know that? Renly had zero experience as a general and only say 2-3 proven commanders at best.  If renly sided with stannis they would havs had a far better chance.numbers dont always win.They do when you have as many troops as all your opponents put together and all of your opponents are fighting each other.  Hell he was winning against the Lannisters without even fighting a battle by blocading the Rose Road.  The only way he could lose is via assassination.I disagree with the bit about Renly. Renly had no claim. He committed outright treason against both the realm and Stannis. He died, deservedly so for it.

And rightly so.At the start of a Clash of Kings, Renly has the second strongest claim to the Iron Throne out of anyone (by law females can only inherit if there is no eligable male of Targaryn decent meaning in legal terms his claim is stronger than Dany's or Shireen's).Had the Tyrells not sided with the Lannisters, he would have King's Landing, and little else as the Lannisters would still have two claimants to the throne, Stannis's army would still be heavily damaged and his Navy would still be destroyed.  Moreover, he would be in a weaker position than Joffery was as he now has to be able to defend a cities whose defenses had already been breached and this time he's fighting Tywin himself.
3107	Israel	2013-05-21	I will NEVER in a million years understand the fandom that surrounds Stannis Baratheon. It really does boggle my mind.I cant explain it, throughout the books you get his sense of honor and duty and justice and his bro is Davos one of the best characters in the series.  theres a lot to like about Stannis Baratheon.  The other thing about him is that he is complex and conflicted and hes just trying to do the right thing.  If you took all the 5 kings one can argue that Stannis is the most fit to be King also that goes a long way.  Also the first two books also set him up to be a major protagonist against the lannister regime another reason to root for Stannis.  Also make no mistake in the Blackwater episode they made him climb up that ladder first for a reason so we could see what all the fuss is about , basically to reaffirm our beliefe system when it come to Stannis... the MANnis.
3108	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-05-21	Renly's duty is to Stannis, second in line or not. The idea that he declare himself King because people don't think Stannis is a nice enough guy is like the worst reason ever. By all accounts Stannis would at least make a decent King, much more so than Renly whose entire reasoning behind being the rightful ruler is that he's kind and likable.
3109	The Dragon has three heads	2013-05-21	This is currently the least concerning thing for a thread.

Moreover, he would be in a weaker position than Joffery was as he now has to be able to defend a cities whose defenses had already been breached and this time he's fighting Tywin himself.Not according to the laws of inheritance nor even his would-be grandmother Olenna Tyrell. Renly had 0 claim. There is no second strongest claim when the the actual heir is still alive.  The Lannister claim is a completely false claim. Period. They're usurpers. Joffrey, Tommen and Myrcella are all children born of infidelity and incest. Again, they have the throne through the treason of house Tyrell and the cunning and iron hand of Tywin Lannister. That's not a claim, it's simply what is.  The only legitimate heir, of all the would-be kings is that of Stannis.  As to the defense of King's Landing, the Lannister army was heavily depleted by the start of the battle. Had it only been them, without the Tyrell army, they would have been utterly destroyed, Tywin either dead or fled back to Casterly Rock, and Joffrey, Myrcella, Tommen, Cersei and Tyrion, heads on spikes. They only were able to turn the battle in their favor because of the Tyrell treason. The Tyrells force was large, even after all of Renly's Stormlords went over to Stannis.  Had the Tyrells returned to High Garden with Tarly and all the rest in tow, bent the knee as was their duty and obligation to Stannis, then the only rightful king would sit the Iron Throne. Stannis would not need a Navy. The Royal Navy was all but eradicated the same as his and the Redwyne fleet would have to sail all the way around Westeros, the same if the Lannisters had any navy to speak of.  Had the Tyrells not committed outright treason against the realm, Stannis would have had his forces, the Stormlands and the Reach forces all under his command. You seriously don't think that Robb Stark wouldn't bend the knee to Stannis and made common cause against the Lannisters? I do. He'd have no reason not to. He had no desire to sit the Iron Throne nor even be King in the North. And had he refused, Stannis, with his army of crownlanders, storm landers and reach, would have utterly destroyed him as soon as the Lannisters were dealt with and Tywin Lannister's head on a spike.

3111	Israel	2013-05-21	Stannis is a self-righteous prig. He only sees things his way. For him, there can only be one butt warming the Iron Throne - his. And he'll deal with shadow babies, leeches and whatever else to achieve that single-minded purpose. I could almost admire his tenacity if it hadn't led to some of the more awful events in the war between kings.What? If there was one actual , real usuper here it is Renly, he knew he had no claim at all, what so ever, and didnt even do it for a good reason , he doesnt believe King Stannis is evil or mad he just thinks hes a better person than him lol. So what he got killed by a shadow baby. Oh no leeches ( saves Gendric from death , = a good thing) , oh no the Castelan at Storms End (kills person who works for usuper = a  good thing).I dont know what your saying.please people lets not forget we know the score, by natural law Stannis is the rightful king and if u are this then u better have just one goal , he can do what ever he wants to anyone who claims to be king although if he fucks w the north im breaking up w him.  I dont think he will tho I think he will accept an alliance w the North to sack KL.
3112	RottenAppleFossoway	2013-05-21	One thing about the Stannis haters I don't get is that, many of these same people love and respect Ned Stark right? And rightly so, the Ned was a great guy, honorable, generally good, but ill-suited to court intrigue. 
 Who was it that Ned sent the letter to? Who was it Ned favored and claimed as the rightful heir?
Fairly certain it wasn't Renly. Actually, I'm 100 percent sure he turned Renly down just before Renly fled south to commit his treason. 
 No, it was Stannis. Because Stannis is the king when Robert dies since Robert produced no trueborn heirs. 
 How well Stannis is liked is irrelevant. He's the king and that's that.
3113	The Dragon has three heads	2013-05-21	Yes but, that's not how it played out is it?
Stannis was defeated by the western alliance because he refused to ally with any other house-thats his failure, no one else's. "And now he and his red witch have banished themselves to the wall..."
Or at least that's how the tavern talk would go...

"And now he and his red witch have banished themselves to the wall..."Or at least that's how the tavern talk would go...Stannis couldn't win over Highgarden because Mace Tyrell wants his daughter to be queen, not because he has any actual sense of honor or duty. The Martells are clearly playing another game while the other houses butcher each other. He has no support from the North because the northern bannermen put it in Robb's head to also declare himself King. Lysa Batshit Arryn is doing nothing for anyone out of sheer Littlefinger-induced paranoia.I don't really know what else he could do. He sends ravens everywhere explaining that all of Robert's kids are bastards born of incest but no one gives a shit because they're all working off their own agendas for power, with no actual respect for duty or the correct line of succession. So who is he supposed to curry favor with?
3115	JonCon's Red Beard	2013-05-21	Renly's duty is to Stannis, second in line or not.

By all accounts Stannis would at least make a decent King, much more so than Renly whose entire reasoning behind being the rightful ruler is that he's kind and likable.I wanna point out that I've seen people dismiss candidates because they don't like them, even when those candidates are actually the most fit to rule. Or vote for a candidate who is "handsome". The major of my district has been stealing money around and this is his second term because he's handsome and charismatic. Democracy or not, people do consider that those are factors their leaders should have and sometimes, this are more important than their ability to rule or lead.I dont' think Renly would have been a bad king. At least the Renly we knew during the first season didn't approve Robert's neglecting of the kingdom. Maybe with the proper training he could have been a better leader, and a proper King who actually wanted to be there, unlike his brother. But it wasn't his right to be there, it was Stannis', and Stannis had zero support and not even readers identified with him until he decided go North and change his "it's my right!" mentality for "it's my duty".
3116	Draco_Dracul	2013-05-21	Renly's duty is to Stannis, second in line or not. The idea that he declare himself King because people don't think Stannis is a nice enough guy is like the worst reason ever. By all accounts Stannis would at least make a decent King, much more so than Renly whose entire reasoning behind being the rightful ruler is that he's kind and likable.If he were from a more established Dynasty and came to the throne through an uneventful succession, yes he would have been a decent king, not well liked but able to administrate well and be carried through by the momentum of his dynasty. However this is a succession crisis in a young dynasty from a heterogeneous society.  In that case being likable is one of the most important qualifications of a king as otherwise the defensible regions are just as likly to simply declare independence and laugh at the would be king of the seven kingdoms that commands neither love nor fear as he is unable to gather a large enough army to take on the ever conquered Riverlands.snipYes there is such a thing as the second strongest claim, otherwise Robert would have never been able to claim the title of king while Viserys still drew breath.  People other than the legal heir being named king has happened numerous times in both history and in Westeroes otherwise the infant son of Areion Targarian would have been named king rather than Aegon VI.What reason do the Tyrells have to bow before Stannis? They gain nothing by supporting him and they lose nothing by opposing him. There is no scenario where Tyrells rush to his aid without him marrying a Tyrell.  Honestly the only reason they wouldn't go independent is that the succession of the restored Kingdom of the Reach would likely lead to a Reach civil war.

3117	The Dragon has three heads	2013-05-21	Stannis couldn't win over Highgarden because Mace Tyrell wants his daughter to be queen, not because he has any actual sense of honor or duty. The Martells are clearly playing another game while the other houses butcher each other. He has no support from the North because the northern bannermen put it in Robb's head to also declare himself King. Lysa Batshit Arryn is doing nothing for anyone out of sheer Littlefinger-induced paranoia.I don't really know what else he could do. He sends ravens everywhere explaining that all of Robert's kids are bastards born of incest but no one gives a shit because they're all working off their own agendas for power, with no actual respect for duty or the correct line of succession. So who is he supposed to curry favor with?Robb would have backed his claim to the iron throne if he could have negotiated with him as he had with renly.  But stannis didn't want to negotiate.  The north was nothing to him until he went there-and let's be honest probably still is.But he could have negotiated a peace or at least pretended too, with rob stark before his assault on the red keep and hit the lannister/tyrell army in the back and crushed them.  Then dealt with the north afterwards.But hey. Thats not what happened.

Then dealt with the north afterwards.But hey. Thats not what happened.I can't fault him for not granting the north their independence since Robb is essentially trying to take back a large part of the seven Kingdoms. Obviously once Ned was beheaded you could argue that the throne forfeit their end of the bargain, but since Stannis will claim no part of it he would just promise justice for the unlawful murder of Ned.Renly may have struck a bargain with them, but as they say, one King means peace, so further down the road that northern independence might very well turn out to be a terrible decision. I don't think pretending to make peace to buy time is very Stannisesque. What good is the word of a King who will later turn around and forego his promise? Plus, the north likely wouldn't come to the defense of the crown later if need be if Robb is granted what he wanted.It was just a no-win situation really. He didn't have the ability to make a queen, he couldn't give the north independence, and the rest of Westeros is just waiting it out. It's just a matter of people doing their duty, as Ned tried to do, but of course nobody was interested in that.
3119	Draco_Dracul	2013-05-22	Actually he has the ability to all of those things, simply abdicate the throne and a queen is made, and the north is given independence (at least in name).  In the end even Ned chose to break from the duty of putting Stannis on the throne in one last attempt to save his family and prevent the escalation to full scale war.  I've said it before and I'll say it again, Stannis's duty has an odd habit of lining up with what is best for Stannis (which to be fair would make sense if you assumed he is an objectivist as to an objectivist the two are one and the same).
3120	JonCon's Red Beard	2013-05-22	The North independence didn't happen because Robb one day woke up and said "we should be free!". The North was offended by how the Lannisters accused Ned of being a traitor, imprisoned and then, killed him and marked the house as traitors as weel. IICR, there wasn't a north conquest by the Targaryens, the Starks just bent the knee and they went along for hundreds of years. The North could have revolted against the throne at any time, but they didn't. When the Targaryens were defeated, they supported house Baratheon based on their old friendship. The northern kings or wardens always chose to support the Iron Throne, whatever their reasons were, but why support them when they beheaded one of  your people?
My point is that calling the Independence of the north had good reasons for the Starks and the main houses of the North, specially at time of war: who continues to support a King who wants you dead? Anyone who had allied with the North could have won against the Lannisters, and later, negotiate with them. I doubt Robb would have denied to support Stannis a king after seeing Joffrey's head on a spike, something that proved that the current King does support the North interests.
3121	Toxspecific	2013-05-22	There are still people who defend Renly's campaign? Wow.
3122	Pinkie Baelish	2013-05-22	There are still people who defend Renly's campaign? Wow.I think he was wrong to not support Stannis, but I can't blame him too much for trying. He had the numbers and the popularity, so why not? And at the time(not regarding Stannis saving the Wall), a Renly-Tyrell alliance would probably have been the best option out of the five kings. Joffrey was a tyrant, Balon was a moron, Robb was in over his head and lacked good counsel apart from Cat, and Stannis had still not recognized his duty to the realm.

3124	David Selig	2013-05-22	no one except maybe robb recognized their duty to the realm, why hold it against stannis?Because Stannis's the one patting himself on the back how he's all about duty and it's not about his personal desires, all the time. The others are more honest.
3125	Mulled Wino	2013-05-22	I wanna point out that I've seen people dismiss candidates because they don't like them, even when those candidates are actually the most fit to rule. Or vote for a candidate who is "handsome". The major of my district has been stealing money around and this is his second term because he's handsome and charismatic. Democracy or not, people do consider that those are factors their leaders should have and sometimes, this are more important than their ability to rule or lead.I dont' think Renly would have been a bad king. At least the Renly we knew during the first season didn't approve Robert's neglecting of the kingdom. Maybe with the proper training he could have been a better leader, and a proper King who actually wanted to be there, unlike his brother. But it wasn't his right to be there, it was Stannis', and Stannis had zero support and not even readers identified with him until he decided go North and change his "it's my right!" mentality for "it's my duty".I identified with Stannis from well before then and many people started backing stannis when he raised davos to hand with the whole "To be lordly is to be false, that much I have learned" speech. Whom do you favor as far as throne contenders?

3126	Mulled Wino	2013-05-22	Because Stannis's the one patting himself on the back how he's all about duty and it's not about his personal desires, all the time. The others are more honest.He doesnt pat himself on the back.  And its not about personal desires.  Even if so, he's the only candidate that eventually recognizes that his duty us to the realm first.  No one else does.  Certainly not fageon.  Dany not yet either.
3127	RottenAppleFossoway	2013-05-22	Yes but, that's not how it played out is it?Stannis was defeated by the western alliance because he refused to ally with any other house-thats his failure, no one else's. "And now he and his red witch have banished themselves to the wall..."Or at least that's how the tavern talk would go...This is partly false. Stannis didn't have another great house supporting him, this is true, but he did have the Crownlanders around Dragonstone and all of the Stormlords after Renly died with the exception of the castellan at Storm's End.
3128	Darth Zyroth	2013-05-22	Stannis is clearly conflicted. That is why he released Davos. True, he was not as opposed to sacrificing Gendry/Edric as he was in SoS, but the doubt was still there.My problem with Stannis during this episode was that he didn't seem conflicted. The way the actor delivered the lines didn't show any internal conflict at all. You couldn't hear his affliction in his voice. He even had an arrogant smile, even when Davos was talking. Also, he seemed to casual while burning the leeches. There was no sign of his hatred against the "usurpers", or his doubt about killing Roob, who regardless of being a traitor, he actually saw as a "good man".There are still people who defend Renly's campaign? Wow.D&D are two of those...

I don't think Stannis really believes Renly would be better for the realm so it's not like he believes that would even be in the best interests of Westeros. Ned chose to break his duty knowing that Stannis would not sit the throne due to his word. Stannis' duty lines up with him being King because that's what he is, at least that's what he's supposed to be. His duty to Robert was to hold Storm's End and when it was given to Renly, he didn't complain about it. That didn't really work out for him, neither did eating cats, dogs, and almost starving because he was told to hold it.So we shouldn't be concerned with doing what's right if it happens to work in our favor?

3130	WatcherontheRock	2013-05-22	What is called character assassination is more due to the nessecity of being quick with the Gendry-stuff. If it had been expanded on 2 episodes, we would have been the first to complain that the show is overplaying his own complexity. 
In this episode, there's the Davos scene which is pretty clear. "We do not choose our destiny. We must do our duty, NO ? Great or small we must our duty". This "no" is fantastic : it's an implied question to Davos "I'm doing the right thing, right ? It's still justice, no ?". Stannis is harsh. That's his main trait. If you are Stannis, you do not show you doubt, there are only hints given to the watcher to decipher. This "no" is one of them, but the whole conversation is. 
And even his first scene with Melisandre shows his doubts, even when he enters the room and finds Gendry being leeched. 
Davos says something very plain to understand, he decodes the scene for us : "if you came here, it's because you doubt". After that, I don't know what you wanted. 
Character assassination is very hard. I think the show improved Stannis' character, he has more presence, more charisma.
3131	The Drunkard	2013-05-22	I wouldn't call it character assassination, but they've definitely cheapened him.
3132	sausagekingchi	2013-05-22	All this blundering on about how Stannis struggles with these sacrfice decisions doesn't ultimately matter or change who he is.  The bottom line is, he was willing to kill these folks so he has a chance of sitting the Iron Throne.  Does it really matter if he struggles with these decisions or is it the decision itself that he should be judged on?  Ultimately everyone is judged on their actions, not the thoughts that run through their mind.  Anyone who thinks Stannis is a "good guy" is a bit delusional IMO.

There was no sign of his hatred against the "usurpers", or his doubt about killing Roob, who regardless of being a traitor, he actually saw as a "good man".I think you have a point. In the books, Stannis was clearly conflicted about his brother, thinking about the fruit he never eat with him and suffering for what he did to Edric's protector just to size the kid.On the show, I got the feeling Stannos needs Davos or else he wouldn't be conflicted at all.
3136	The Drunkard	2013-05-22	Ugh, just thought of something, sorry if it's already been mentioned. Melisandre mentions that Stannis needs convincing, and thus the leeches. On the Inside the Episode, the two guys talk about a 'logic gap' that Stannis is unable to cross in regards to believing in the Red God. Is he going to hear about Robb's death, and rather than do as his book counterpart did and accurately pass it off as Walder's doing, attribute it to R'hllor? Please no.
3137	sausagekingchi	2013-05-22	Uh well, Mel wanted to burn Edric. Stannis insists no, with some advice from Davos. So they just leech him. There's a big distinction there.Yeah, in the beginning he only allows the leeching but then he changes his mind and agrees to sacrifice him because it serves his purpose to sit the Iron Throne.  That is why Davos smuggles him out so Stannis can't kill him.
3138	The Drunkard	2013-05-22	Yeah, in the beginning he only allows the leeching but then he changes his mind and agrees to sacrifice him because it serves his purpose to sit the Iron Throne.  That is why Davos smuggles him out so Stannis can't kill him.Well, firstly, he never agrees to it. He moves closer to accepting, true, but never crosses that threshold. Secondly, wanting to save the throne is not his only motivation. He threatens Melisandre with a long and painful death if she is deceiving him, and then there's this: "If I must sacrifice one child to the flames to save a million from the dark <U+0080> Sacrifice <U+0080> is never easy, Davos. Or it is no true sacrifice."

Justice needs to be served and I think Stannis will pay for his sins with his life before all is said and done.

Davos says he knows Stannis doesn't want to do it. You need only to listen to what they're saying to know that Stannis doesn't want to do this thing but he feels perhaps he has to. That is the very definition of conflict. He seeks Davos out. its not like Davos breaks out of his cell and says WAIT PERHAPS I CAN CONVINCE YOU TO BE CONFLICTED.

Justice needs to be served and I think Stannis will pay for his sins with his life before all is said and done.No, it doesn't absolve him of any immoral decisions he might have made, but let's honest here, a man needs to be judged on his deeds, not on what he might have done. He didn't burn Edric, so I think it's pointless to continue disputing that point. He has burned other people, but never an innocent (we can debate the Florent), and thus I don't think Stannis' crimes are as grievous as those of others in the series. He does assasinate Renly, despite whatever lack of clarity exists in his mind regarding the deed, but I think it's rather silly that people continually harp on this point. His brother stole all his bannerman and was totally fine with slaughtering him on the battlefield due to his overwhelming numbers. People talk about lack of honor here, and I think it's pretty silly. As though Stannis should just lay down and let his brother murder him in the field. There's nothing "honorable" about having a host of bannerman, led by your generals, (Renly didn't no shit about military strategy so he won't be contributing) slaughter your brother, and anyone who says otherwise is delusional. In fact, the whole point of this series is that there's a disconnect between the reality of the world and the idealsm of fuedal honor codes. Stannis doesn't strictly adhere to them, clearly, and for this reason he's something of a pragmatist. All in all Stannis is no Ned Stark, (which is why he's still in the game) but the man hasn't ever crossed the line or done anything truly evil in my book. I admire his unyielding nature, and the love he seems to bear for his daughter, however inexpressible it may be.  The immoral acts that Stannis commits are part of his character, and I think they make him more endearing in the end. I certainly am in the George R Martin camp, in that, I think the character has demonstrated that he genuinely cares about the realm and the fate of its people. After reading a Dance With Dragons I find it odd that this point is so highly contested by people who hate him. I can agree that Stannis fans like to whitewash him, same deal with those obsessed with Dany, but you have to remember that not liking a character doesn't change the source material. In the end the series isn't built on heroes and villains, but rather on individuals, beautiful and flawed in a wide variety of ways. Stannis has his faults, but in comparison to the rest of Westeros, I find him to be a man with a prickly sense of honor who's heart is in the right place.

The leech scene could have been so intense and awesome, instead we got awkward softcore porn with the cheap shock value of a Leech on Gendrys junk, rather than quality good acting and storytelling yet again.  
Another great moment I couldn't wait to see done on screen in the crapper.

I liked the way the leeches were used and it seemed to be a respectable ceremony. Really, if they had made a short bit, where Mel had suggested that she needed Gendry to trust her and help her cause, and then Gendry rebuffed her a bit, it would have been a better setup.

3153	Draco_Dracul	2013-05-23	Why would he abdicate the throne if he's the rightful King? I don't think Stannis really believes Renly would be better for the realm so it's not like he believes that would even be in the best interests of Westeros. Ned chose to break his duty knowing that Stannis would not sit the throne due to his word. Stannis' duty lines up with him being King because that's what he is, at least that's what he's supposed to be. His duty to Robert was to hold Storm's End and when it was given to Renly, he didn't complain about it. That didn't really work out for him, neither did eating cats, dogs, and almost starving because he was told to hold it.So we shouldn't be concerned with doing what's right if it happens to work in our favor?Aemon was the rightful king, yet he gave up his right to the throne.  When Robert gave Storm's End to Renly, Stannis constantly complained about it.  Additionally, not holding Storm's End was even more likely to Stannis killed than trying to hold it.Stannis has never done what's right when it's not in is favor, the one time he could see absolutely no benefit from doing the right thing, he buggered off to Dragonstone rather than informing his king of his suspicions that his children were bastards born of incest and his Hand was murdered.
3154	teemo	2013-05-23	They have absolutely cheapened Stannis.  I don't even recognize him most of the time.  This pussy whipped softie whose grossed out by Leeches, I couldnt tell if he was just not interested in the leeches or grossed out by them or both, but it was terrible regardless.The leech scene could have been so intense and awesome, instead we got awkward softcore porn with the cheap shock value of a Leech on Gendrys junk, rather than quality good acting and storytelling yet again.  Another great moment I couldn't wait to see done on screen in the crapper.My thoughts exactly.  Such a powerful scene to me in the books and the way they cheapened it seriously made it really goofy. Like laughable.

He left court because despite these suspicions he didn't have the proper proof, and he knew Robert hated him and never would have taken his word for it. He did everything he could to uncover the truth with Jon Arryn, and hoped that hearing the truth from Arryn would convince Robert of the incestuous relationship between Cersei and Jamie.

Additionally, he only left after being denied the position of Hand and he never resigned is position as master of ships.  By his duty to his elder brother, his duty to his king, and his duty to the position on the small council he should have never left King's Landing.  If he's as dutiful as he claims to be, what was he doing to stop the Lannister plot to take the throne through deception (he didn't even send out the letters with those accusations until three of the five kings had already been crowned)?

3160	Pixi Penrose	2013-05-23	Character assasination is a strong term, but yes, I think it's getting there. I did like the scene with Davos,as it reminded the viewers of Stannis' not being without conscience, but I think show-Stannis has been dropped on the floor:-/
I always saw book-Stannis as a hard man, but one who wanted to do the right thing. I hate that he's been shown as week and totally reliant on Melisandre. He is not evil, he believes that he is the true heir,and thus MUST BE KING, cause those are the rules. He is not a lovesick puppy, who let's himself be whipped by some random red woman. I'm not saying Stannis is good and just and will be a great king. But he doesn't question himself and his goals, and he is not working for gold or ambition, but for what he sees as the only right thing to do. There are no if's or but's in Stannis' world. So yes, I think the term character assasinatin is in order.
3161	Draco_Dracul	2013-05-23	proudwing, tell me how proudwing was in his favor?  You tell me why you think proudwing was included in the story.In the end he abandoned Proudwing, did he not?
3162	jarl the climber	2013-05-23	In the end he abandoned Proudwing, did he not?I guess he did not hawk with him anymore but he might have kept him in his room and stayed buddies with him. I do not think he had the bird cooked into a stew or anything like that. We are not even sure he took the advise this guy gave him, he might have stayed loyal to Proudwing til the bird passed on. There is a theory that Stannis sent him to live on a bird sanctuary in the Summer Islands.

He is not a lovesick puppy, who let's himself be whipped by some random red woman.He explains that quite clearly this episode. He didn't choose this, he just must do his duty. And Stannis is being portrayed at his lowest point right now. He has no one really besides Mel, because they've had to cut the "Queen's men" and Florents I guess for the sake of culling an already huge cast. But even in the books he's in constant solitude and sees no one but Mel. What does that say to you besides he relies upon her?You're missing that as a PoV structure, we only see Stannis after he decides to free Davos. We have no idea really what happens while Davos is a prisoner. All you can do is guess based on prior characterization, but he very well could have been in a similar state while Davos is locked up.
3165	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-23	i can't fucking wait until the later stannis chapters in the show. they better be good. im worried that they wont be because ive read that one of the D's doesn't like or understand stannis' character so im shaking my head. ''STANNIS! STANNIS! STANNIS!'' omg.

''STANNIS! STANNIS! STANNIS!'' omg.That's just fan overreaction. I believe Weiss said Stannis would make a terrible King (Which many people actually argue on these forums) Ultimately Weiss' opinion at that time can only go so far - he comes to rescue the wall from Mance and he and Jon bond in that weird Stannis-Jon way, and he eventually fights against the "bad guys" in Bolton/Frey. They're already portraying his upswing from the Blackwater defeat (where they made him look like a total badass by the way - not the way you characterize someone you "hate") so by the time he gets to the wall his character will be more or less in the right place.Plus he has epic 1 liners in aDwD. I'm sure we won't see them all but epic 1 liners are a good way to get the audience more intrigued by a character.
3169	Kyoti	2013-05-23	Just my two cents, but as someone who became a fan of this series through the show then read all of the books I have to chime in and say that TV-Stannis is really making me like Book-Stannis a lot more. Until the last couple of Stannis scenes I did not understand how anyone could like the guy enough to actively wish for him to sit the Iron Throne, but I do see why people like him now. As a converted Stannis hater I can tell you that the show depicting him as a badass dealing with Renly, kicking major ass at the Blackwater, and being shown as a human with Shireen and freeing Davos elevates the character more than the books ever did for me.
3170	Thelastactionhero	2013-05-23	And he never wrote to or tried to contact the new Hand of the King (and best friend of the king) in any way shape or form.

Robert's continued slights and his unwillingness to grant Stannis the authority to do what was necessary, in addition to imminent risk of assassination, completely justifies his return to Dragonstone in order to muster his forces and plan his next move. Perhaps he could have done more to inform Eddard, but let's be honest here, despite Ned's honorable reputation there's no way Stannis could be wholly certain of who to trust in this matter. If this is a failing on his part its an extremely minor one, and in the end it isn't Stannis' fault that Robert and Ned are butchered. I think your assessment of Stannis is extremely narrow and ignores a substantial amount of the source material. If Stannis' actions are all motivated solely by personal gain, than why does George R characterize him as a "truly righteous man"? If you pay attention to the POVs, both Jon Snow and Davos see something special in Stannis, in that unlike the other kings he truly is fighting for the realm. He's far from perfect, and I won't pretend that there isn't a dimension of personal ambition involved with his decisions, but I feel that his adherence to duty and his concern for the realm supersede his desire to sit upon the big chair. This is most clearly illustrated in his bond with Jon Snow, because those POVs offer us the most objective vantage point in which to assess Stannis' character. He certainly has flaws, but most heroes do, I think it's more than clear his heart is in the right place.

Stannis is a guy who sees everything in terms of black and white, and he tries to do the "white".  He can be spiteful and prideful, but he won't do things he believes are morally wrong.  Almost a unique character, in some ways, because I really can't think of an analogy from elsewhere in fantasy/SF.  I think Stannis would have been a crappy King because justice must be tempered with mercy, but that's still better than a King who doesn't even believe in justice.One great scene in ASOS is when Axell Florent wants to go ravage the Claw because those men swore fealty to Joffrey after losing at the Blackwater, and plays to Stannis sense of justice by pointing out their betrayal. Davos argues against it, and ultimately convinces Stannis by pointing out that he betrayed King Aerys.  And you can tell that Stannis is actually listening to the morality involved, and trying to do the right thing.  It's a great scene, and shows why Stannis is very admirable in some respects.

Stannis will do horrible things to you if he feels you deserve it, but he won't butcher innocents, especially not for reasons of spite. I think he was definitely slighted by Storm's End, but more so by Robert's decision to choose Ned as Hand of the King instead of his own brother, who for the past several years had worked tirelessly to help Arryn rule the realm. You're correct that it is a failing on Stannis' part, but I can understand why he felt the situation was hopeless and ultimately choose to peace.

Then, he surprises us by actually choosing the correct moral course, and admits his error.  It's like GRRM does this great mind-fuck on us that makes us forget Stannis' virtues until we're reminded by one of those "Righteous Stannis" scenes.  Which we promptly forget again....I'm just as guilty of that as anyone.

If one may abandon duty because it is inconvinet then how is Renly any more in the wrong than Stannis?  Even if you excuse him fleeing to Dragonstone, why doesn't he send warning to Ned Stark.  Had he sent a letter to Ned from Dragonstone to Winterfell warning that he suspected that the Lannister Twins were screwing each other it may have prevented the Starks from pursuing false leads or even to get Ned to voice his suspicions to Robert while they were in the North.Edit: My problem with Stannis is that there is no other man in the series that falls so short of his own standards.  There are many worse men, but none who make such statements of being just and dutiful.  And to be honest I think Stannis's fans served to sour my opinion of him more than the man himself as they seem to apply a lower standard to him than anyone else.  Had Renly been the one to find out about the incest and fled King's Landing without telling anyone, he would be accused of being a traitor.

3175	Knight of Dubious Honor	2013-05-23	Greetings, first time poster here.
I've skimmed through this thread and found it suprising that the one scene from the last episode, which in my opinion helped bring Stannis back on the right track, is used as an example of this character's "assasination".
Let me preface by saying that personally I also believe that Stannis Baratheon looses a lot of depth in the tv show, compared to the books, and that the showrunners struggle with this character since season 2.
However the scene between him and Davos from the last episode, was probably one of the best characterisation of Stannis in this show, and a scene that finally brought glipmse of the character from the books.
The main problem with TV-Stannis so far, was the way showrunners presented him, which made him look almost like another villain. Not like the conflicted man who was brought into his position by forces he couldn't control or fight, but like just another asshole who wanted the throne "becouse it was his birthright". Its not that Weiss or Bennioff wrote him in a way that conflicted with the book version, no, its just that the specific bits and pieces of him that they decided to show, were almost all negative. They always shown only his angry, stern, demanding side. For those who didn't read the books, this could paint a picture of Stannis that was rather negative.
But here, in this scene, we finally got a glimpse of Stannis that suggests to the viewer his true motvations. Stannis that didn' pursue the crown becouse he wanted to rule and felt cheated, but Stannis that was tricked into believing it was necessary. Not only that, but we were also presented his doubting and compassionate side, by showing him trying to find a reason to save the boy. Now, someone could argue, that he sure as hell didn't seem to fight Mellisandre strong enough. They could argue that it was strange for Stannis to say "just get on with it", when he first talked about the Red Witch plans. After all, in the books he wrestled with the decision to burn Edric, almost half the novel. But that wouldn't work in the show, couse for all the scences of Stannis acting stern in the previous season, his character still hasn't been properly established, there just wasn't enough screen time. In the books, we could have Stannis wrestle with the decision for so long, becouse up to that point we had several hundred pages worth of Stannis acting like a stern douche with a stick up his ass, so it all balanced itself out /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' /> If they did that in the show however, the sudden change from supposedly unforgiving, uncaring Stannis that they wanted to build over the last season, would be to jarring. Instead the showrunners navigated this situation rather gracefully.
By making him say "just get on with it" as soon as he learned of what Mellisandre wanted to do with the boy, they showed the typical stern side of Stannis Baratheon who didn't want to waste time by questioning and pondering the harsh truths that were unavoidable and necessary. But at the same time, by pitting him against Davos in that scene, they showed that there's more to the man than meets the eye. There wasn't any big, literall demonstration of compassion, no, that would be too much, that would be uncharacteristic. Instread we got the brooding, yet still not totally lost to human compassion Stannis. By showing him looking for Davos as possible, sneaky means of avoiding the inevitable, they showed the true Stannis - a man that is resigned to the inevitable fate, and who won't defy the Red Witch, but who at the same time is searching for reasons and methods, to blunt the edge of all the things she makes him do. Which is perfect. The showrunners had their cake and ate it too, in that moment.
Also, the more I watch Stephen Dillane act, the more I am in love with his potrayal. The showrunners handling of Stannis might not have been perfect up to this point, but Dillane's performance is just great for Stannis. That highly tense, growling, guttural acting, combining intensivity with revserve and emotional restraint, and sprinkling it all with that strange awkwardness he has, when talking about the things he doesn't want.

3176	GallowsKnight	2013-05-23	There is quite a difference between burning a woman who murdered your unborn child in your womb, and a slave master responsible for thousands of dead babies and countless amounts of human suffering, as opposed to burning people as sacrifices to a god in the chance it may help your cause.What about tiny children that are playing outside?
3177	The Dragon has three heads	2013-05-23	This is partly false. Stannis didn't have another great house supporting him, this is true, but he did have the Crownlanders around Dragonstone and all of the Stormlords after Renly died with the exception of the castellan at Storm's End.With an I believe out of character lack of strategic acumen he went straight for the throat at KL without anyone to back him up.It was a mistake as it left him open to attack from behind, and that's what happened.
3178	A Winters Summer	2013-05-23	Shut this thread down. It is way out of hand.
3179	The Dragon has three heads	2013-05-24	It is?
...must have missed that bit...
3180	stannisismyking	2013-05-24	I often wonder how many Stannis fans who hate the portrayal in the show loved him from the get-go in the books. The arc for Stannis is going pretty much exactly how I expected it. I'm not denying TV!Stannis is a lot less complex than book!Stannis but nearly all the characters suffe that fate.
And also can someone point me to the chapters where his interactions with Melisandre when Davos is not around in ASOS are shown?  I've read the Dragonstone chapters several times but I must have missed those.

I've read the Dragonstone chapters several times but I must have missed those.Yeah, I only really started to like him after he saved the Wall. Before that he was okay, but he kinda bored me a bit, especially in the first half of ASoS. By ADwD he'd become my top favorite character in the entire saga.
3182	RottenAppleFossoway	2013-05-24	Yeah, I only really started to like him after he saved the Wall. Before that he was okay, but he kinda bored me a bit, especially in the first half of ASoS. By ADwD he'd become my top favorite character in the entire saga.That's pretty much how I feel about him as well. His interaction with the new lord commander are some of the best dialogue in the entire series to me.
3183	Toxspecific	2013-05-24	In the start of the series, I was a Robb fan and supported him over Stannis until he bitterly disappointed me as a leader, but I found Stannis interesting and sort of like a badass warlord. That was it. Now, the guy's much more to me as a character.
3184	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-24	With an I believe out of character lack of strategic acumen he went straight for the throat at KL without anyone to back him up.It was a mistake as it left him open to attack from behind, and that's what happened.Yeah, that's kind of obvious.  Given that Tyrion was bottled up inside KL, and there supposedly weren't any significant Lannister forces in the area, a halfway prudent commander would have landed some mounted scouts.  It's not really a case of surprise because everyone knew Stannis was coming anyway.Similar glitches with Tywin's attempt to cross the Red Fork.  No experienced commander in his right mind would push equally at ten different river crossings.  Perhaps a feint or two, but then you'd concentrate at one and just push.I don't think those are deliberate characterizations of a lack of tactical acumen, though.  GRRM isn't a soldier, and can't be expected to write as if he'd spend a major part of his life thinkign tactically.  Stannis not having any scouts out or read defense was simply necessary for the plot, not a deliberate attempt to show him screwing up.  IMHO.
3185	Stannis' shadow babies	2013-05-24	That scene was perfect in my eyes. Stannis was playing devil's advocate, talking like that to Davos so his counselor could counterargument. I also saw some sort of real disgust when he talked about Renly, that sort of smile read self contempt to me.
I'm biased, of course, but I think there's a reason why Stannis is seen with admiration and/or respect by the few people who may be considered 'good' in this story: Davos, Ned, Jon. That's got to count for something.
I admit I wasn't very happy with TV Stannis at the beginning, but now I'm liking the way they're unfilding his story. In fact, I think they're paving the way for a big redemption. Just wait and see what happens when Dany begins her trail of destruction and ineptitude and there's only one man who seem to be doing the right thing. I think many people, non book readers especially, will have a change of heart.
And I don't know why I read these threads either /bang.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bang:' />
3186	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-24	It is unfortunate that they skipped the whole scene where Stannis refuses to attack the Claw, and ends up calling the whole idea "evil".  That would have shown more of the positive side of his character.  Stil, the scene where Davis tells Stannis that the only reason Stannis came down was because he already knew it was wrong to kill Gendry served the purpose.
I think they may skip Davos defying Stannis, and just have him convince Stannis that the idea is wrong.  But who knows.
3187	WinterWarrior	2013-05-24	Actually I like the Stannis character in the books and love Davos. I think the scene between Stannis and Davos in the dungeon was one of the best of that episode. Yes, he calls on Davos to balance him and to give him reality checks. Stannis will not kill Gendry.
I was taken by Davos telling Stannis that Gendry is his "blood" and his "nephew", talking about him as if he was a true Baratheon.....pretty heady stuff to call a bastard child of Stannis' brother with a tavern wench that just came on the scene. It makes me wonder if my suspicion that Gendry will be the only Baratheon left in the end might be right on. House Baratheon may survive only through Gendry.
And I am sure Davos will spirit Gendry away as he did with Edric Storm in the books. Hmmm....I wonder if he will run into Arya wherever he goes.....

3188	Nezzer	2013-05-24	And I am sure Davos will spirit Gendry away as he did with Edric Storm in the books. Hmmm....I wonder if he will run into Arya wherever he goes.....I'm starting to think it will be Stannis himself that will send Gendry away instead of Davos, probably after being persuaded by Davos. In the synopsis for episode 10 it says "in Dragonstone, mercy comes from strange quarters" and Stannis is known by all the other characters for being utterly without mercy. That might make Stannis much more sympathetic. I don't want to see him threatening to kill Davos like in the books. The sooner he becomes likeable, the better /happy.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt='^_^' />

So, he would fit the "stranger" character. If he actually smuggles him out, then that would be even a more strange way to give mercy without actually being the King.
3190	ServantOnIce	2013-05-25	I am a member of Team Stannis and thought he was too rigid in the books. "I want to be king, because I am supposed to be the king, that's the way it is."
He was too stubborn until the Wall Thing happened and  ADWD then I realized, there is goodness in King Stannis.
3191	Toxspecific	2013-05-26	He was certainly somewhat too pissed off and stubborn pre-Blackwater, but unlike a common perception, he didn't fight the battle badly; remember that he would've won it if not for Tywin bringing in a last minute miracle.
After that he became more flexible in matters where he did not need to contradict his principles and developed as a leader; something neither Robb, Joffrey, Balon and Dany did not do.
I don't necessarily desire for him to become King at all costs; if in any way it lessens the quality of the series then I sure as hell don't want him to become King and this is the difference I find between myself and other StanStans and other fandoms; we don't put the character above the series. At least I don't. And I find this indirectly making me think he's more awesome.
I saw a signature in some user's post, something about the realm needing Stannis as a protector but not a King; like a 'Dark Horse' as the sig said. Sounded cool and I agree with about half of it.

If he actually smuggles him out, then that would be even a more strange way to give mercy without actually being the King.I think this refers not to Gendry's spiriting away as much as it does to Mel and Stannis hearing Davos out instead of chopping his head off.I think it is crucial for the character dev of all three to have Mel say the "You are not a friend of me, but you are a friend of the king". bit.
3193	Conchobar	2013-05-27	I didn't see any sign of character assassination. Didn't you pay attention to the end of his conversation with Davos. He went to see Davos because he knew what Davos was going to say and that part of himself was disagreeing with Melisandre. It's very clear he is conflicted.Edit: /ninja.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':ninja:' /> 'dYour avatar is amazing! Where did you get that?? lol

3197	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2013-05-27	Yea Stannis is just like Batman....Not! I missed the Batman that had sex with a fire priestess so he could birth a shadow demon to kill two people one being his brother. Stannis character has being simplified a bit like most everyone in the show. They have pretty much nailed it so far though. People don't like him. He's not a nice guy. He decides to kill Edric after the three kings death comes true. Stannis is in a horrible and desperate position. He feels it's his duty to rule the realm but noone likes him so they won't fight for him. He kills his brother with his bastard shadow demon and his armies surrender to fight for him. Stannis gets most of them killed because he doesn't know where the Lannister army is at. Davos saves Edric and ships him out, because being the person whom probably knows Stannis the best, he knows Edric is about to be given over to Mel by Stannis. So Stannis is left with no army and no crown. Davos convinces him that the only path is to be seen as a savior of the realm so he can win the northmen to his side. Only then does Stannis go to the wall. To get an army so he can take over the realm.

3199	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2013-05-27	If Stannis is such a great guy why does he have Melisandre around? Why does he have sex with her? Why does he use that to birth a demon shadow baby to assasinate his brother? Why is he going to kill Edric Storm? Because he will do anything for power. If it will give him a weapon he will do it. No matter how heinous.
3200	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2013-05-27	Stannis never thought of going to the wall and saving the realm. How many people did Stannis ever send to the wall from Dragonstone? He was a powerful lord surely there must be instances throughout the books of men of the Night's Watch from Dragonstone right? It took The Onion Knight to actually get through to Stannis that hey maybe you could actually do the right thing and maybe that will help your cause.
3201	bobbybuilderton	2013-05-27	It's been made clear that his desire is not power, it's to do his duty. His duty happens to be serving in a position of power, since he was supposed to be second in line.
I don't have anything to say as far as Stannis being good or bad, but it kind of irks me when people project greed and ambition onto him. Think what you want about the things he does, but he very clearly is doing them because he thinks it's his responsibility to and he's stubborn, not because he has some huge overwhelming thirst for power >.>. If he wasn't rightfully second in line and he didn't have Melisandre telling him he is some foretold hero, I highly doubt he would be doing any of this.
Once again, no comment on if his actions are right or wrong. Just that I wish people would get his intentions straight.

3202	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2013-05-27	Yes Stannis thinks it's his duty to gain all the power
3203	bobbybuilderton	2013-05-27	Yes Stannis thinks it's his duty to gain all the powerNot for power's sake though, which is what people who hate him seem to think.He's not like "I MUST RULE EVERYONE, I want ALL the power and control!" like certain queen regents we know of. Like I said, it happens that doing what he's expected to do falls in line with a position of power. That is not the same thing as wanting power itself. This is a pointless debate that I will have no more part of.

3204	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2013-05-27	I agree that he is not the power hungry Littlefinger. I agree with that last statement Bobby. But he will do anything to gain power so he can do his duty.
3205	Mammothsbane	2013-05-27	"I am king. Wants do not enter into it. I have a duty to my daughter. To the realm. Even to Robert. He loved me but little, I know, yet he was my brother. The Lannister woman gave him horns and made a motley fool of him. She may have murdered him as well, as she murdered Jon Arryn and Ned Stark. For such crimes there must be justice. Starting with Cersei and her abominations. But only starting. I mean to scour that court clean. As Robert should have done after the Trident."Pretty much sums up Stannis.The "Inside the Episode" for Ep. 8 has some exposition about Stannis.. It shows that D&D seem to understand Stannis, although they haven't done that good a job demonstrating it through the episodes. No Florent's means he is much more fanatical than he was in the books.This scene, however, shows that he might begin to turn away from Mel and towards Davos.
3206	Batman	2013-05-28	Why are they making Tyrion more TV audience friendly and Stannis less book audience friendly?
3207	Stannis' shadow babies	2013-05-28	I'm ok with Stannis being the real underdog, for now. It's all Daenerys and her pretty dragons until the Targaryen girl goes mad -I mean really mad, Aerys, Viserys-mad. Once Dany starts making poor decisions and basically messing it all up, the TV audiences 
	Spoiler already having lost Robb
 should look up this supposed religious freak, Stannis.

3208	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-28	But he will do anything to gain power so he can do his duty.That's the real internal conflict within Stannis, and it's really the same conflict when he joined Robert's Rebellion.  He really tries to do the right thing, and sometimes, it is not easy to know what that is.  Davos nailed him in the books with the zinger about him joining Robert's Rebellion and betraying his King, and Stannis was an honest enough man to credit the point.  That's really Stannis at his best to me -- he's basically accused of treason by Davos, and all he ends up saying, essentially, is "you're right, and thanks for pointing that out."   It's quite remarkable in its own way.And Mel has put Stannis in a tough position, because she's told him that horrible things will happen to everyone if he doesn't become King.  And that creates another dilemna for him, because I don't think he'd consider offing Gendry/Edric or sacrificing a child at the Wall simply to become King.  Whenever those choices present themselves, he's always asking Mel "Is this really necessary", and she responds by saying how the world will fall into darkness if he doesn't, or some such shit.  And he struggles with that.
3209	Lord Varys	2013-05-30	I think the Stannis-Davos scene actually showed something the books did not yet show as well as the show. The reason why Stannis turns to Davos when he does. In the books, the impression is created that Stannis is actually somewhere in the middle between Davos and Melisandre, and needs to be swayed in this or that direction. It's also indicated that he may not be aware what kind of people are surrounding him (i.e. Axell Florent or Clayton Suggs). But that's not the case. Stannis is a good judge of character and he pretty much knows what Davos, Selyse, Melisandre, Axell, Justin Massey, or Clayton Suggs are going to tell him before they do.
The fact that Stannis goes to Davos shows that he himself has doubts about Melisandre's plans, he does not really need Davos to tell him what to do he knows that well enough.
3210	Boi	2013-05-30	Make it up as goes is alongs. Stannis was supposedly the cold brittle hard justice or ironwill. Which the drunken fierce warrior Robert wasn't, or that of the people pleasing partying Renly. Comparing himself to his brothers of why he is stronger and how his claim is justified.His character has been butchered into nothing more then a sheep, a total whimsy of follow the pretty sorceress, behaving quite out of nature of what we would expect from a king or even a man. She says, he does. As a potential king believing himself to be better and his cause just. She should have been a prop to increase his confidence. Never to make him into just another dumb follower. Possibly why he didn't take her on the Black Water, but blame Davos though. Now he is a little dismayed and rethinking his actions so he has given pause, but never enough to believe he is lost or was ever wrong.He seeks Davos for advice never to interfere with his justice or that cold ironwill. This stated as him cutting off Davos fingers. Both have respected each other a lot more from that experience and trust each other in their friendship. Davos has always believed in his king, but questions the witch, bromance as means of protecting him. Stannis gaining a loyal subject one he trusts if he doesn't trust anyone else fully. A hug and a kiss with some naughty corner time so Davos can learn A,B,C. Without him having to say a R'hllor prayer or even kneel before their new god is without questionably stupid. Desipite wether Gendry life is at stake. Gendry would have been seen as nothing more then another pretender in any logical circumstance. Royal blood without sacrifice, would sew seeds of distent and jealously. Stannis wants the power for his claim, and is also wanting that fire. Because his wife a cold fish turned devote, and their greyscaled abomination. As king he wouldn't thave thought twice about justifing his means if he believes in that cause while thinking he is right. This is what cold ironwill is. Not the sheep which we now see who b'ah'ows before his she witch. She may have spells but this is far stretching our imaginations. I accept she is a manipulative seducteress, this should be fuel or fire for his will regardless of sacrifices that loss of army. Not Stannis the sheep who follows turning to be a wihm of flaw and questioning his belief. I know you had sex with the bastard look at my face and tell me you didn't. King Stannis doesn't kill out of lust, rage, or will, being man and king? Davos mate is it okay? I have given you free wr'eading tution in the corner and meals, let me ask you if it is okay to scarifice, please bro for the sake of our friendship let me hear your words? This doesn't make any sense apart from pity on that pretender. He will sit so well in future. Winter is coming but lets all laugh at those false prophets. I honestly would rather be second guessing.

Slap your wrist sir you have been a naughty boy. Placed those hands irons without the chains, that stool you have been sittng was in the corner for those A,B,C's.. Please darling, can I have your advice though. You see I want to burn stuffs because my gods a pyro-maniac. I just don't know if I should. You see the priestess is upstairs right now fucking the bastard boy because my seed is been used.

3214	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-05-30	Nice job calling people dumb for having difficulty getting through your amazingly weird post.
Obviously we've both read the books and watched the show. I think your way of speaking (typing) is extremely awkward, and that you've certainly ignored enough of Stannis' characterization to white knight him beyond reason, to a degree where trying to argue rationally about the show's portrayal of Stannis would be an exercise in futility.
3215	Boi	2013-05-30	I understand that turnips give gass.
My arguement is from both humour and in retrospect of what a king in his position would be doing or done. He is not a family man for part of the reasons I have stated. Maybe though I am trying to fill the gap of the missing jester. Or maybe I am just dumbfounded at the humour this bleating sheep pretender has brought me. With no real reason left to second guess his claim to the iron throne, as he was shown to be a whimp.
On serious advice if you were having trouble reading Italic print might I suggest some corner time for those A,B,C's. You sir have been derogatory to me from my first post, showing the wrong knowledge of the book. Not that here there is an altogether comparison, however you had brought it up previously. I look for a joke, I know that might be awkward or confusing. In defense there are plenty to make from sceens which don't make much sense.

3219	Boi	2013-05-31	Possibly if you had read the books maybe you will have gained a joke. In belief the Nights Watch comments on gassy turnips. You see, the jester uses in poem. Awe struck a pretender won't get far from being just a sheep. I would have liked to have second guessed this. Not watch him bleat over Melisandre who is shown with having the Balls. I expected a King and Man from Stannis. Who claims that his brother were weak. Renly the young people pleasing party go'er, Robert the strong fierce drunken warrior who never wanted the throne. Stannis is always comparing and in contempt. He believes his claim to be lawful, that he is just in his belief of himself, from being the one true king of Westeros. Seeing everybody else as pretenders to be sacrificed to his new found faith in R'hllor, because maybe he likes to burn stuff. Fire to fuel that Ironwill. I guess most here struggle with, wat that post.No flames intended, but to further break the joke down for you in case you missed the punchline? A night full of dark turnips is going to be one giant sh.tstorm, although hazarding a guess that when asleep it will be some killer gas..Only joking. Some dump though, diddly squat. Maybe I'm taking this ass'ass'ination thread to far, my bad.............D'oh

3220	trearu	2013-06-17	Sometimes it seems like, some Stannis-Fans have not read the books properly.
Literally in the first Chapter he appears he behaves causeless cruelly and completely unjust. (Treatment of the old maester)
The just behaviour he sometimes shows is the result of his limetless pride.
We don't hate Stannis in the books because we only see how he presents himself to others.

3221	Young Nan	2013-05-20	So I'm very confused about the scene when Daario got an iron coin and said "Valar Morghulis".   In the book I don't recall him ever using that expression, and so far, in the show we've only seen it associated with Jaqen H'ghar.   My husband, a non-reader, now thinks Daario is a faceless man.  I tried to convince him otherwise but he thinks its a show-only change they made. Is that what they were going for?
3222	Kernest	2013-05-20	I don't think so, Valar Morghulis and Valar Dohearis are very common Bravoosi sayings, thought tv-viewers are rightfully confused at least until Arya arrives at the Bravoosi ship...
3223	Pepi	2013-05-20	Not sure if It was ever explained in the show but Valar Morghulis just means "all men must die".

I'll reckon getting the Braavosi coin means u lose, but still ... It felt kinda weird and unexplained.

3228	Tony Soprano	2013-05-20	Valar Morghulis is just a saying in Braavosi. It's not exclusive to the Faceless Men. I forgot, wasn't the coin that Jaqen gave to Arya just a regular Braavosi coin with those words on it? Just like the Titan's Bastard said, it's just a Braavosi coin. That's all. Daario isn't a Faceless Man. At least, I hope not.
3229	Ser Lemmington	2013-05-20	I thought it was just a comment upon receiving the Braavosi coin. The FM are known to have their House of Black and White there, so he likely referenced them as another way of saying "Oh, Braavos."

3242	Kasrith	2013-05-20	in the show we've only seen it associated with Jaqen H'ghar.It has been said across the map by everyone.Mel and ThorosDany and Missandeiand I'm sure a few more times as well
3243	i-sawr-the-ghost-of-harren	2013-05-20	Why did Daario lose? I'll reckon getting the Braavosi coin means u lose, but still ... It felt kinda weird and unexplained.Yeah, that's it, getting the Braavosi coin means you lose. Kind of a weird system for draw IMHO. The whore knew where all three were sitting at the time, heard their voices. And the Braavosi coin was FREAKING SQUARE. THE OTHERS WERE ROUND. Yeah sure, the whore didn't see the coins from the Titan's Bastard's purse, but she's a WHORE, she's received coins probably all her life!!! I doubt she doesn't know what those coins looked like. (Yeah I know the actual draw isn't so important, but still I had to rant, LOL)
3244	Young Nan	2013-05-20	It has been said across the map by everyone.Mel and ThorosDany and Missandeiand I'm sure a few more times as wellYes, this is true, and I had forgotten about Mel and Thoros' exchange. However, my friends noticed also that Daario called her "lovely girl" the same way that Jaqen H'ghar used to call Arya that.  I watched the show with two unsullied that they both thought that his mannerisms and the braavosi coin scene were hints that Daario is a FM.For the record, I don't believe the theory and I've read the books five times at this point.  I don't know if the directors were tying him to Jaqen deliberately, as a red herring, or whether it was just a poor/random choice of lines like having Tyrion say "and now my watch begins" instead of the "whores for imps like me" line.

3245	siknes	2013-05-20	Not sure if It was ever explained in the show but Valar Morghulis just means "all men must die". I guess that was just Daario's way of saying "what the hell, I lost the draw, I'm going in". Not sure if I understand the draw, tho. Why did Daario lose? I'll reckon getting the Braavosi coin means u lose, but still ... It felt kinda weird and unexplained.Gives him a reason to kill the other two leaders, maybe.
3246	silentwanderer	2013-05-20	So I'm very confused about the scene when Daario got an iron coin and said "Valar Morghulis".   In the book I don't recall him ever using that expression, and so far, in the show we've only seen it associated with Jaqen H'ghar.  It made me miss Jaqen rather than welcome Daario. Nice try anyway, show!
3247	JMJ	2013-05-20	In addition to what's been said about how common the phrase is is Essos, I'll add that it was probably meant to be a red herring to the viewer, in that at first, we are meant to think Daario is thinking, "oh well, so I'm the one chosen to kill Dany," when in actuality he is thinking, "these other guys forced me to do this, I will now kill them."
3248	siknes	2013-05-20	This.I can see how non book readers might start to think Daario is either a faceless man, or more specifically, Jaqen himself. In fact, using the similar lines even further accentuated that possibility. Red herring? Possibly. New theory / conspiracy rambling material? Definitely! haha.I watched the first two seasons before doing a straight month reading, and I pictured Daario as/similar to the actor who portrayed Jaquen.  Only unlikable, pedaphilia aside as a reader I seem to want Dany(who has the same lustful fantasy of beauty over love) and Mormont. together before he saves her sacrificing himself. Something book Daario would never do.
3249	mcb	2013-05-20	Yeah, that's it, getting the Braavosi coin means you lose. Kind of a weird system for draw IMHO. The whore knew where all three were sitting at the time, heard their voices. And the Braavosi coin was FREAKING SQUARE. THE OTHERS WERE ROUND. Yeah sure, the whore didn't see the coins from the Titan's Bastard's purse, but she's a WHORE, she's received coins probably all her life!!! I doubt she doesn't know what those coins looked like. All valid points... however, my take on the scene is: the captain is blatantly rigging the "draw" and doesn't even bother to pretend otherwise. Presumably to teach Daario some kind of a lesson.
3250	Kasrith	2013-05-20	or whether it was just a poor/random choice of lines like having Tyrion say "and now my watch begins" instead of the "whores for imps like me" line.I liked that, celibate Tyrion is a scary Tyrion lol
3251	Mammothsbane	2013-05-20	Don't Braavosi coins say "Valar Morghulis/Dohaeris" (spelling) on them?
3252	lostinwesteros	2013-05-20	So I'm very confused about the scene when Daario got an iron coin and said "Valar Morghulis".   In the book I don't recall him ever using that expression, and so far, in the show we've only seen it associated with Jaqen H'ghar.   My husband, a non-reader, now thinks Daario is a faceless man.  I tried to convince him otherwise but he thinks its a show-only change they made. Is that what they were going for?In the book, I remember it was a big revelation when I finally found out what "Valar Morghulis" meant, once Arya got to Braavos, and that made it so much more significant.  TV-wise, it's starting to crop up everywhere.  Missandrei had also said it when walking out of Astapor with Dany, just after she'd been freed.  Then Mel said it when she greeted Thoros, too.  Really dilutes it, I think.
3253	GoldenFleece	2013-05-20	Mero said explicitly that the one who draws the Braavosi coin will do the deed.Yeah but interestingly the way he actually said it "A coin from Braavos.  The Braavosi does the deed" (which turns out to be Daario).  Not saying that Daario is a Faceless man, it was just interesting the way the dialogue put it.  Hints are made in such ways.
3254	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-05-20	It was actually quite clever, since he's basically saying it to Mero and Whatshisface, kind of a throwback to Dany's "but we are not men" to Missandei earlier. It seems at first like he's saying it about Dany but once you see the betrayal of his two captains it was pretty cool to think back and realize that little connection.
3255	Pepi	2013-05-20	It was explained, in clear dialogue, that the man who got the Braavosi coin would be the one to go into the camp.Sry, I didn't catch that.
3256	jmk51	2013-05-20	Maybe "lovely girl" is just part of the Bravosi dialect?  That's still weird to me.
3257	baxter	2013-05-20	I just took it to mean he knew he got the short straw and was most likely marching to death.
3258	baxter	2013-05-20	[img]http://asoiaf.westeros.org/public/style_images/asoiaf/snapback.png[/img]Envie, on Today, 08:45 AM, said:This.I can see how non book readers might start to think Daario is either a faceless man, or more specifically, Jaqen himself.

3259	JonCon's Red Beard	2013-05-20	In the show, they're making Valar Morghulis to be a common phrase among people from Essos, or so it seems. A way to identify them from those who are Westerosi natives.
3260	lunadangelo	2013-05-20	This.I can see how non book readers might start to think Daario is either a faceless man, or more specifically, Jaqen himself.

Definitely! haha.Absolutely. /agree.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':agree:' />I always thought that Daario is not the baddy most believe him to be including Dany. She says that he will betray her so many times, it would be boring if he did.

In fact, using the similar lines even further accentuated that possibility. Red herring? Possibly. New theory / conspiracy rambling material?

Hey if Jon said "you are a lovely girl" to ygritte would you tihnk he's a faceless man? for christ's sakes, daario is a lady killer, and complementing women is part of a lady killer's everyday dialog so saying lovely girl is NOTHING to him.my god.
3262	WiDMNDBAMMD	2013-05-20	So I'm very confused about the scene when Daario got an iron coin and said "Valar Morghulis".   In the book I don't recall him ever using that expression, and so far, in the show we've only seen it associated with Jaqen H'ghar.   My husband, a non-reader, now thinks Daario is a faceless man.  I tried to convince him otherwise but he thinks its a show-only change they made. Is that what they were going for?In the show Missandei says Valar Morghulis to Dany, and Dany translates it and replies "but we are not men". Melisandre says it to Thoros and Thoros gives her the "all men must serve" then later says "all men must serve" in the common tongue. That was a big added exchange that Arya heard someone else say those words and the response.There's been tons of references to High Valyrian / Valyrian being the languages that people in Essos use, even Talisa writes a letter to her mom in Valyrian.It was a square common coin from Braavos. I didn't think it looked iron but no matter. Daario said the expression because he got the Braavosi coin.Did anyone notice if the three coins were the three places the three men were from? Titan's Bastard is from Braavos, Daario is from Tyrosh(or will they change it to keep the possibility of the stupid blue dyed hair alive?) and I don't know about the other guy is from...Anyway, Mero, aka Titan's Bastard comes up with the idea that the Braavosi coin marks the killer obviously referencing the Faceless Men are from Braavos. I don't think the intention was to make it seem like Daario is a Faceless Man, it just made him "the assassin that gets to disguise himself" and kill Dany.Daario also probably knows that there's a good chance he won't get out alive from sneaking in and killing her, thus it's kinda a suicidal mission.However, my friends noticed also that Daario called her "lovely girl" the same way that Jaqen H'ghar used to call Arya that.  I watched the show with two unsullied that they both thought that his mannerisms and the braavosi coin scene were hints that Daario is a FM.They might make Daario from Lorath like Jaqen supposedly was. Then they leave open the possibility that the boy we meet later on dyes his hair blue still.Yeah but interestingly the way he actually said it "A coin from Braavos.  The Braavosi does the deed" (which turns out to be Daario).  Not saying that Daario is a Faceless man, it was just interesting the way the dialogue put it.  Hints are made in such ways. /agree.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':agree:' />Add the fact that Mero aka Titan's Bastard is from Braavos and it makes perfect sense for Daario to give that response when he gets the coin and is ordered to assassinate Dany by disguising himself.
3263	silentwanderer	2013-05-20	Maybe "lovely girl" is just part of the Bravosi dialect?  That's still weird to me.It seemed to be strictly a Jaqen-Arya thing.Valar Morghullis, on the other hand, has been used by every character from Melisandre to Daario.

3264	WiDMNDBAMMD	2013-05-20	Maybe "lovely girl" is just part of the Bravosi dialect?  That's still weird to me.Did Syrio Ferrel say it? Syrio is from Braavos, Jaqen is not.Remember Jaqen H'ghar is from the free city of Lorath(the closest one to Braavos)? He tells Arya this when he's trying to get her to give him water when he's in the cage. Jaqen wouldn't claim to be from Lorath and not speak like a Lorathi. His accent agrees with that back story. Jaqen is not claiming to be from Braavos.Does his accent change a little when he says "farewell Arya Stark" ? It's such a small amount of words that I couldn't tell. I would think that like he does in the book he drops the accent when he changes his face and Jaqen dies. Who knows though.
3265	LordBloodraven	2013-05-20	Mero, the Titan's bastard was pretty cool. They should have cast him as Daario
3266	Dubbs	2013-05-20	I took it as a joke, because he drew the braavosi coin he spoke a phrase relevant to the coin and the act.
3267	Head of The Ned	2013-05-20	Syrio = Jaqen = Daario. DuhThis!
3268	boojam	2013-05-20	Yeah, that's it, getting the Braavosi coin means you lose. Kind of a weird system for draw IMHO. The whore knew where all three were sitting at the time, heard their voices.

Yeah sure, the whore didn't see the coins from the Titan's Bastard's purse, but she's a WHORE, she's received coins probably all her life!!! I doubt she doesn't know what those coins looked like. (Yeah I know the actual draw isn't so important, but still I had to rant, LOL)I believe the coin Jaquen gave to Arya was a round, in particular a coin from the House of Black and White.Other Braavos coins most likely take  different shapes.
3269	silentwanderer	2013-05-20	Does his accent change a little when he says "farewell Arya Stark" ?All I remember is that A Man had other things to do as well, and she was to give the coin to any man from Braavos and say Valar Morghullis.Much like Daario said.

3270	Where Boars Glow	2013-05-20	Uhhhhg I caught this while watching the episode and knew it was only a matter of time before the faceless man theories started rolling out.
3271	GoldenFleece	2013-05-20	Mero, the Titan's bastard was pretty cool. They should have cast him as DaarioYeah pretty cool character.  Kind of wished we got to see more of him.  Mero vs Ser Barristan would have been epic!
3272	Nictarion	2013-05-20	GRRM implies, in Essos, all speak some form of Valyrian and know the canonical greeting.Melisandre and Thoros used it a few episodes back.In fact Thoros gave the required reply "Valar Dohaeris" a few episodes back, first time we have heard it on the show.Didn't Dany say it to Missandei earlier in the season, like episode 2 or 3? Dany then makes the comment "but we are not men".

3273	Nictarion	2013-05-20	Maybe "lovely girl" is just part of the Bravosi dialect?  That's still weird to me.Daario is not a Bravosi, he is a Tyroshi.
3274	Michael Stark Thenextwolf	2013-05-20	Its because the coin was from bravos
3275	Young Nan	2013-05-20	The fact that he said "valar morghulis" doesn't mean anything in and of itself, I just raised an eyebrow about him saying it in association with a braavosi coin, and then calling Dany "lovely girl" the same way that Jaqun used to say it to Arya.   
I don't believe Daario is a faceless man at all.  I just noticed the connection, and so did the two unsullied I watched it with.   In this thread and others, more than a few people said their unsullied said the same thing.
It was either careless writing (they unintentionally wrote the character similarly to Jaqen) or a red herring, to make the audience suspicious of Daario, IMO.  Too many people are comparing Daario with Jaqen for it to be a coincidence.  
I explained to my husband and friend that he isn't a FM, he is just a douche.  They don't believe me, they think im either trying to not spoil them, or that the directors changed it to make the show more interesting.

Admittedly,  it would be funny if Dany and Arya just so happen to be protected by the same - faceless - man. But I seriously doubt that is the case.

3278	wolverine	2013-05-20	It was explained, in clear dialogue, that the man who got the Braavosi coin would be the one to go into the camp.Wasn't the Braavosi coin square though?  Can't the skank feel that even if she doesn't look at the coins?
3279	flinn	2013-05-20	I always took the coin that was given to Arya as a coin used by people who wanted to go to the temple to die.
Braavosi would know what that was for and as part of their culture/religion assist in any way to help the one seeking death to get where they needed to go.
 The coin given to Daario was just a common coin from Braavos.
3280	JMJ	2013-05-20	Mero, the Titan's bastard was pretty cool. They should have cast him as DaarioAre you kidding? That tongue-flicky thing he did with Dany was just plain cheesy and nasty. Reminded me of Hannibal Lecter thinking about fava beans and chianti.
3281	Lord Twat-Beard	2013-05-20	I think we are trying to over-analyze this. It was just a quip on receiving the coin from Braavos.

And you guys were right about Daario being Tyroshi, but the Faceless Men were from Braavos, so what is with that line about the Braavosi doing the deed.  Hmmm... might not be true but is is an interesting thought!
3283	Nictarion	2013-05-20	Daario is not a FM. People are reading to much into things, that simply aren't there.
3284	callmedodge	2013-05-20	Valar Morghulis is a really common greeting in Essos. That`s all there is to it.
3285	Ice Turtle	2013-05-21	I wonder if the Braavosi coin wasn't some form of clumsy TV foreshadowing. Dany will conquer Meereen and Volantis (Volantis is mentioned in almost every episode) but Braavos will prove real trouble, if she tries to take it, they will kill one of her dragons so she will let it be and moves to Westeros without conquering it.  
VM, is common phrase used in Essos. IA, "lovely girl" is much more weird.
I don't remember in the show, but in the book common Braavosi coins are square, coin Jaqen gives to Arya is round, probably older than Braavos itself, it works like badge for FM so common folk knows what they are dealing with and help them. 
The whore knew which coin she was giving to whom and the sellswords knew she knew. 
There are some similarities between Jaqen and Daario even in the books, both have rather remarkable hair color, both are handsome and Jaqen's second face has golden tooth too. But there is no chance they are the same person, though I wouldn't be surprised if someone from Dany's close circle was a FM.
3286	The_Gallows_Knight	2013-05-21	Did anyone notice if the three coins were the three places the three men were from? Titan's Bastard is from Braavos, Daario is from Tyrosh(or will they change it to keep the possibility of the stupid blue dyed hair alive?) and I don't know about the other guy is from... The coins were from Mereen, Braavos and Volantis, so assuming Daarion is still Tyroshi, no. I would guess that the third guy was a Ghiscari as Daario's two colleagues was in the book.
3287	Nakraal	2013-05-21	I think we are trying to over-analyze this.

Dany will conquer Meereen and Volantis (Volantis is mentioned in almost every episode) but Braavos will prove real trouble, if she tries to take it, they will kill one of her dragons so she will let it be and moves to Westeros without conquering it.  Braavos is the biggest anti-slavery free city there is. The original settlers were the former slaves of the dragon lords of Old Valyria. There's quite a few theories that the FM will appose Dany because of her dragons. Even though Dany is using them to free slaves instead of enslave men.Citizens from Braavos "do not jest of dragons"I don't remember in the show, but in the book common Braavosi coins are square, coin Jaqen gives to Arya is round, probably older thanBraavos itself, it works like badge for FM so common folk knows what they are dealing with and help them.It's round so old that it's has a face that is faded from being worn and it's iron, not silver or gold or bronze or copper. Iron is not  a common metal to use for coins in Westeros or Essos or anywhere. Many people think that it might tie the Iron Bank to the Faceless Men.The whore knew which coin she was giving to whom and the sellswords knew she knew.So it's her fault that Dany is alive then. LOLThere are some similarities between Jaqen and Daario even in the books, both have rather remarkable hair color, both are handsome and Jaqen's second face has golden tooth too. But there is no chance they are the same person, though I wouldn't be surprised if someone from Dany's close circle was a FM.In the books they cannot be the same person because Jaqen is an old town at the Citdael under a new identity of 'Pate' and Daario is next to Dany in Mareen.There's no way he can be in two places at once.The coins were from Mereen, Braavos and Volantis, so assuming Daarion is still Tyroshi, no. I would guess that the third guy was a Ghiscari as Daario's two colleagues was in the book.Well we know what happens with Mereen and Dany and we know that the slaves/former slaves in Voltanis are "waiting for her" and we know that Braavos was founded by the escaped slaves from Voltanis. The headquarters of the Faceless Men is there as well as the Iron Bank and they worship all the gods there.I think it's only a matter of time till someone posts a crazy theory about how the person getting the Braavosi coin was foreshadowing that Braavos will oppose Dany.or it could be looked at the other way, the people that opposed her drew the Voltanis and Mereen coin and they got killed but the coin from Braavos joined her instead of opposing her.

3290	King in the North Carolina	2013-05-21	+1It was just a TV trickDaario saying "Valar Morgulis" = The 2 captains get he accepts Danny must die and that he'll do the deed, when in facthe just says Valar Morgulis = his captains must die. A threat spoken directly to his captains but almost ensuered they wouldn't get it as a threat to themselves.This, almost certainly. I thought that was a clever use of the phrase.I would assume "lovely girl" is a popular phrase, nothing more. I suppose it could be a bit of FM red herring, but I'm not sure what that really serves.
3291	GoldenFleece	2013-05-21	There are some similarities between Jaqen and Daario even in the books, both have rather remarkable hair color, both are handsome and Jaqen's second face has golden tooth too. But there is no chance they are the same person, though I wouldn't be surprised if someone from Dany's close circle was a FM.It would be feasible that the FM upon hearing about Dragons would try and put a spy in Daenery's circle to gather information at least to find out what they are dealing with.  Would be wise in fact.  But my guts tell me that Daario is not a FM.
3292	GoldenFleece	2013-05-21	I do admit Daario as a FM is quite interesting though.
1) Questionable switch of allegiance to Daenerys (for her beauty).  He saw his chance to be near Daenerys to spy on her for FM, he couldn't do that without bringing the Stormcrows with him.
2) Killed two Captains of the Stormcrows, don't know how, in fact we never see him killing anyone, but he does kill ( his method more like an assassin than a warrior perhaps?).
3) He has a swagger, something Bravvosi's are known for.
It is a fun crackpot theory.  Heh maybe he was mean to assassinate her, but fell in love with her instead.  Cheesy romance.

Seemed to me they just mashed all the mercenaries into one company and Daario was a Lieutenant for the Second Sons.
3294	boojam	2013-05-21	Daario is not a Bravosi, he is a Tyroshi.That's true , and 99% of the Braavosi are not even associated with the House of Black and White and the FM.(Tho the Iron Bank may have some connection to the FM.)
3295	jmk51	2013-05-21	Wasn't the Braavosi coin square though?  Can't the skank feel that even if she doesn't look at the coins?I wondered that as well.  She clearly could have known who she was giving the coin to.  Was it a set up? Did Dario know it was a setup the whole time?
3296	GoldenFleece	2013-05-21	I certainly need to rewatch but I thought he was a "Second Son". Seemed to me they just mashed all the mercenaries into one company and Daario was a Lieutenant for the Second Sons.In the show he is a second son, its the books he is a stormcrow.
3297	silentwanderer	2013-05-21	I always took the coin that was given to Arya as a coin used by people who wanted to go to the temple to die.The way I read it, the coin wasn't as important as the words Arya was supposed to say. On the show, this wasn't as clear (although Jaqen did make her repeat them twice).Daario scene, however, made it look like the coin itself meant he was bound to kill someone.His Captains just didn't know they  were the ones who were going to die.

3301	Zorpack	2013-05-21	It's definitely been used by more characters then Jaqen. I dont see how he could get that confused.
3302	RottenAppleFossoway	2013-05-21	I took it simply as Daario was handed a Braavosi coin so he used the expression the Braavosi so commonly use and nothing more
3303	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-21	I took it simply as Daario was handed a Braavosi coin so he used the expression the Braavosi so commonly use and nothing moreYeh, plus aren't the words actually written on the coin? I could be wrong.

3307	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-21	Not sure. I thought it was round though. The one in this episode was squareYeh, it was round....this one was triangular I think
3308	silentwanderer	2013-05-22	It's definitely been used by more characters then Jaqen. I dont see how he could get that confused.Thoros, Melisandre, Arya even.I doubt this means any of them is Jaqen H'ghar any more than Daario Naharis.

3309	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-05-22	Even if viewers think Daario is from Bravos, saying he's a faceless man is like saying every person who's ever said "konichiwa" is a ninja.
3310	AGV	2013-05-22	I never thought of the Daario and Jaquen connection. In the books it would never make sense, Jaquen was this mystery that we know so little about while Daario was just a sleazy, lusty boytoy of Dany. But in the show...why put a Braavosi coin and the phrase Valar Morghulis in the same conversation?And the actor kinda looks like (albeit a more handsome version) of the guy that Jaquen changed face into. I get why non-readers would think of that connection. But if the writers are really hinting at that, well it just seems preposterous and too much of a stretch for me.

3312	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-22	I've seen so many Daario = Crow's eye theories, I'm glad I can discredit them entirely now, I mean REALLY aha
3313	boojam	2013-05-23	Yeh, it was round....this one was triangular I thinkJaqen's coin was a Braavos House of Black and White coin.Later Arya uses one to scare a guy to death!Just like any political entity Braavos must have many coins.
3314	boojam	2013-05-23	In the book, I remember it was a big revelation when I finally found out what "Valar Morghulis" meant, once Arya got to Braavos, and that made it so much more significant.  TV-wise, it's starting to crop up everywhere.  Missandrei had also said it when walking out of Astapor with Dany, just after she'd been freed.  Then Mel said it when she greeted Thoros, too.  Really dilutes it, I think.Since it's used many times in the books by many different characters , in you view , it must be diluted in the books.I was kind of disappointed that Mero, Prendahl and Daario didn't start their conversation in Valyrian, since they seemed to have intelligence on Dany (like how many Unsullied she really had). Then she asks them to speak common tongue for Jorah and Selmy's sake , since they only understand some Valyrian.It would have been a nice little touch.
3315	Indru	2013-05-24	I watched the episode, but never even noticed the <U+0080><U+009E>lovely girl<U+0080><U+009D> line. Obviously he can't be Jaqen, since it would mean Jaqen had to travel a very long way in a time so short, get to the rank lieutenant of the Second Sons, and also change his face again for whatever reason. Nope, I just don't buy it. I read the books, he's definitely not Jaqen.

But if the writers are really hinting at that, well it just seems preposterous and too much of a stretch for me.eh, it was 3 different coins for 3 different people to draw from.  Valar Morghulis is macho fatalistic bravado that is similar to what I imagine soldiers drawing a dangerous detail have said for thousands of years.  And will continue to say...like Klingsons saying "It is a good day to die." /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />It's certainly not strange that Mero would have Braavosi currency in his pocket.  I suspect all the merc company soldiers have, literally, a "mixed bag" of coins at any given time.Even if we conclude that the "Daario is a faceless man" door is ajar, there's literally no reason to suspect that he's Jaquen.  We might as well suspect that Hizdahr is Jaquen.

3320	Stannis' shadow babies	2013-05-24	With the benefit of hindsight, didn't "Valar Morghulis" just mean "You are both dead"? /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />I took it in both ways. He says it as "so be it", but also sounded quite like an upfront hint that he was going to kill both men (especially when you consider the scene with Daenerys and Missandei "All men must die -but we are not men")
3321	silentwanderer	2013-05-24	Since All men must die = Valar Morghullis, I'd have to agree.The Captains were already dead, they just didn't know it yet.

D&D know what they're doing. They know that after last season, the Unsullied are looking for signs of Jaqen; he was one of the most enigmatic characters of season 2 and he can literally be anyone. Now we have another young, handsome, brutally efficient killer who randomly decides to protect one of the show's heroines and he's using two of Jaqen's catchphrases.
I say it's intentional. Either D&D are veering off on another bit of AU fan fiction or they're leaving a red herring.

3324	lunadangelo	2013-05-25	I have said so before, I do not believe Daario to be the douche bag that many believe him to be. The very fact that Dany goes on and on about him being below her, not worthy of her, him going to betray her etc. etc. just makes me believe that he will in fact not betray her.  So this whole new line of thinking that he may be sent by the faceless men makes some sense, even though I do not believe he is Jaqen

3325	silentwanderer	2013-05-26	Considering Jaqen wanted to take Arya with him last season finale, the only way I could picture him as Naharis its if Daario actually died young and Jaqen took his place among his Captains just about now.
Either way, I can't picture any reason why Jaqen would bring Arya to Daenerys's location or hide her among the Second sons until he won the Queen's trust.

3332	hotweaselsoup	2013-05-27	I always took the coin that was given to Arya as a coin used by people who wanted to go to the temple to die.Braavosi would know what that was for and as part of their culture/religion assist in any way to help the one seeking death to get where they needed to go.The coin given to Daario was just a common coin from Braavos.I think the coin given to Arya was the equivalent of a FM business card.  Arya believes that the face on the coin was so old that it was worn away, but I believe that there was never a face there at all.  I think that any Braavosi would recognize this coin, and also assume that its bearer was a Faceless Man - hence why the ship's captain was so deferential and offered Arya a berth right away.

"Lovely girl" is a show thing, couldn't find either saying that in the text.The first words Jaqen even says to Arya is "Boy, Lovely boy" in ACOK when they are at the Inn traveling North. Page 85 at the bottom of the paper back. I bet he also says it in Harrenhal but "lovely girl" in the books, it is not a show thing. Daario isn't Jaqen, Valar Morgulis is a common saying and Missandei is quite lovely.
3336	Le Cygne	2013-05-27	I saw where he said lovely boy, but not lovely girl, we were just wondering if there were clues in the books.  Just fun to speculate. 
Seeing what else he called her... at one point he says sweet girl, then again.  Lovely girl, Tyrion says a couple of times and Cersei.  Not used very often.  But it was a fine choice for the show.

3340	cuendillar	2013-05-30	I don't see anything odd with the "Don't scream, lovely girl" phrasing either. It was clearly spoken to, and about, Missandei when he released her. As there's no way he'd know the name of Dany's handmaiden (she wasn't introduced at the meeting) he called her the first thing that came to mind. As easy as that.She is a lovely girl and a womaniser like Daario is certainly not missing that. It could also have been a callback to Mero calling her "slave girl" at the meeting and being generally rude, to further prove that he's distancing himself from them rather than just continue in their way.

3345	Manfryd Lothston	2013-06-16	He also used the phrase "lovely girl."  definitely raised an eyebrow.Raised both of mine. As well as the "Valar Morghulis" bit. And also that, apparently, Daario is no longer Tyroshi, but probably Braavosi.Not to mention the nonchalant way he goes about killing his partners and city guards. I would definitely be inclined towards a Faceless Men connection.Looking at the big picture: FMen would then be: in the Citadel, reaching for Death of Dragons; in Meereen, near Daenerys; commanding the Ironborn through Euron (who either is a Faceless man or is connected to them); converging on Jon in the North (Melisandre's visions). The hand of the Great Other is tightening its grip...
3346	Sandra Melis	2013-05-21	Is it only me... or the face carved on the weirwood tree in the Sam the Shatterer scene was too similar to the White Walker face?This may support the theory regarding the Others and the Old Gods...!

3349	TomBadgerlock	2013-05-20	Firstly: all of those who feel there needs to be a "justification" for nudity, I have trouble seeing as anything more than sex-phobic. Secondly: if one were to attempt to justify it, I would think it would have something to do with Mel's assertion that fear spoils the blood or something? Like she was talking about with the lambs? I don't know. Either way, I didn't have a problem with it.

3351	Lucifer Lightbringer	2013-05-20	Maybe sex makes the blood extra tasty. Which could be informative of some of the less conventional practices of shepherding in lonely, rural areas.
3352	Young Nan	2013-05-20	I was confused.  She told Stannis she wants to sacrifice him, told Gendry she will draw off his essence and make a shadow baby with him, then did the leech trick.
Its funny how a few weeks ago we were all arguing over whether she'd wanna burn him, shadow baby him, or do the leeches. 
turns out everyone was right, she wants to do all three rolled into one.
3353	amilas	2013-05-20	Hated it. I'm usually okay with certain changes but Gendry is one of my favorites and this just messes with him too much for my taste. I really can't explain how many things are wrong with this scene...I am, for the first time in my life, lost for words.
3354	Pinkie Baelish	2013-05-20	Wait, wait, wait. Wouldn't creating shadowbabies with Gendry be a better option than leeches? Mel needs king's blood for shadowbabies presumably, so if Stannis is a spent force, why didn't she actually just have sex with Gendry? 
Er...not like I'm trying to justify extra nudity or anything. Of course not. Hehehehehe....
3355	kephv	2013-05-20	I was neutral towards it. On the one hand, it was too obvious to me why they did it: they have quotas to fill. However, it was surely less unexpected to the new viewers who might've thought there was something besides leeches in the box. So this might have been one time where it was more than pandering (as they were going for the shock and switch factor), but it was still a bit weird - there's sure to be viewers wondering why they didn't send another smoke monster, for instance.

But seriously, don't have a problem with it at all. I agree with the sex-phobic comment.
And also, I would be freaking out too if someone dropped a leech on my donger.

3364	Ser Skuall the Wolfheart	2013-05-20	Remember her scene with Stannis? She told him a lamb is tastiest when you show it a knife because the fear prompts their blood to rush like crazy, therefore soaking up the meat with blood. She ended the conversation by saying, I never show the knife. Soooooooo instead of rising his blood by scaring the shit out of Gendry, she got his blood rushing by well.... ya know. She placed the leeches as soon as Gendry was getting into it.Poor dude, getting led on like that. At least the Bastard wasn't around to cut the fun!

She told him a lamb is tastiest when you show it a knife because the fear prompts their blood to rush like crazy, therefore soaking up the meat with blood. She ended the conversation by saying, I never show the knife.Soooooooo instead of rising his blood by scaring the shit out of Gendry, she got his blood rushing by well.... ya know.She placed the leeches as soon as Gendry was getting into it.Poor dude, getting led on like that. At least the Bastard wasn't around to cut the fun!She said that if the lamb see the knife it will panic, ruining the taste of the meat. That is why she never shows the lamb the knife.I think they are just making Melisandre's show magic include sexy time. They have made her into kind of a vampire that leeches off the energy of others to perform her feats, whether the energy be sexual, or in the actual blood or body of a victim. Is that a good choice? Probably not. Do I mind seeing Carice van Houten naked? Definitely not, even if it is for a reason that is kind of strange.
3366	Miryana	2013-05-20	Firstly: all of those who feel there needs to be a "justification" for nudity, I have trouble seeing as anything more than sex-phobic.Sex-phobic? I watched Spartacus. It merrily threw in at least one scene of sex or nudity (but usually about five) in every episode and spent four seasons searching for ways to top the previously aired threesomes, orgies and brothel scenes. And despite looking like the fratboy show vs. the prestigious HBO GOT, it was still smarter about sex. Spartacus was the show you could have expected to focus only on naked women for its presumably teenaged/twenties male audience, yet it had absolutely no problems with balancing the inevitable female nudity with full frontal men and gay sex. Spartacus was honest about presenting sex as entertainment but it also had fun with it and said to hell with the viewers who are going to be uncomfortable with celebrating the male body as well as the female one. By comparison, GOT sadly seems lacking. They've been criticised for the imbalance before so this season we actually got to see Robb naked from the back and not just Talisa undressing, and Loras got another sex scene despite the protests about his two very mild scenes with Renly. But it's only small progress when the show still feels like it's far more interested in finding excuses to add more scenes of female nudity, vs. Spartacus which gladly undressed both male and female characters. The problem isn't sex, it's that in GOT most of the time it seems like such an artificial, cynical addition to make the show edgy and appealing to a stereotypically defined young male viewer rather than a realistic part of life or equal fun for all ages and both genders.In general I approve of the change with Gendry taking Edric's place in the plot, but it was hilarious (yet, considering GOT's focus on sexy naked women, unsurprising) that they managed to combine the leeching with naked Melisandre. The spirit of SNL's 13-year-old boy was definitely present when they came up with this take on the plot (no Edric = no need to add an extra character, and hey Gendry is old enough for sex with Mel!!!) . I'm still interested in seeing how the rest of the arc plays out and hope it leads to good acting by Stannis and Davos, but this particular scene was more like a comedy interlude. Once it got serious, I did like the cut from the leeches to Joffrey having a drink.
3367	Lady of Shalott	2013-05-20	Just wondering, why was Gendry so afraid of leeches? There really was nothing scary about them...
3368	Roadside Rose	2013-05-20	Will Gendry have a shadow baby?
3369	Lucifer Lightbringer	2013-05-20	Just wondering, why was Gendry so afraid of leeches? There really was nothing scary about them...I would be similarly distressed if someone tied me naked to a bed and began depositing parasites on my genitals against my will.
3370	Lady Hornwood	2013-05-20	Just wondering, why was Gendry so afraid of leeches? There really was nothing scary about them...Well, firstly I guess he was just afraid that the leeches are just a start and that Mel means to torture him, kill him, or slowly draw all of his blood, secondly, it's always scary to have things touching your genitalia if you don't want it, especially if it's living slimy things that drink your blood.
3371	StannisandDaeny	2013-05-20	As soon as Mel walked in and gave him the look I thought 'ohh now I know why they got rid of Edric. Actually as soon as I saw him alone in a bedroom and knew Mel was coming. So predictable. Didn't like it, and not for the nudity or the fact there's no Edric (I'm happy with seeing more Gendry, but not in this way), but for the fact Gendry is being mistreated, where with Edric this was never the case. While perhaps not love, Stannis always showed a healthy respect to his family.
I don't think Mel needs to have sex with someone with King's Blood to make Shadow assassins (why else try to seduce Davos...?), but think about it, one assassin is just one kill, or so it has seemed to far, and they can't travel over water. So there's really no point in her having sex with Gendry, she could have easily just asked him hey here's some leeches, I'm sure Gendry wouldn't have minded, it's a small price... No instead they had to make this 5 minute awkward sex scene between two people who are just waaay too far apart in age.
Oh and well played HBO for setting it up so it seems like the RW is going to be Stannis' fault HBO, nicely done. *sigh*

3372	David Selig	2013-05-20	I found this scene hilarious. The leech on the cock was the cherry on top. The excuse for the sex was so absurd I couldn't help but laugh. Being tricked into getting naked on a bed by a priestess known for human sacrifices isn't scary at all, right? /cool4.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':cool4:' />
 Mel could just ask Gendry to endure a bit of the leeches for gold and put them on his arm. Simples, faster, easier... But then - no boobs. Not that I am complaining, it was an entertaining scene.
3373	Daemul	2013-05-20	Just wondering, why was Gendry so afraid of leeches? There really was nothing scary about them...I was thinking the same thing, leeches aren't all that bad, they don't do much harm, having one on your dick would be scary though.
3374	Roose Boltons Pet Leech	2013-05-20	I was thinking the same thing, leeches aren't all that bad, they don't do much harm, having one on your dick would be scary though.I'd probably react much the same way as Gendry to being tied up and having a leech put on my penis.
3375	boojam	2013-05-20	I was confused.  She told Stannis she wants to sacrifice him, told Gendry she will draw off his essence and make a shadow baby with him, then did the leech trick.Its funny how a few weeks ago we were all arguing over whether she'd wanna burn him, shadow baby him, or do the leeches. turns out everyone was right, she wants to do all three rolled into one.As in books there are no shadow babies , it's all Voodoo-like stuff, the three deaths , in fact could be considered as coincidental. They just hyped the sequence from the novel.If Stanis had of been smart he would have gone after Tywin which would have been more effective.But I guess you only get three wishes?!(Of course the Tywin situation takes care of itself outside of any magical intervention.)I would have put the triple whammy on The Great Other!O yes seems they are condensing the Davos save , in this case Gendry, I can't remember from the novel that Stanis took an early interest in saving ... well Gendry in this case.

Davos demanded proof of her God's abilities. The leeches are a teaser as to what the Lord of Light can do. Hence why they are keeping Gendry alive for bigger things.3. You are aware that Mel and Stannis burnt "effigies" of Rob, Balon and Joffrey in the books before any of the deaths occurred?
3377	Grandpa House	2013-05-20	Just wondering, why was Gendry so afraid of leeches?

(I haven't read the thread about the non-readers, but now it might also lessen the surprise?)I expected the leeches and I didn't mind the way they handled it, the shadow babies wouldn't have worked and I'd rather see random naked scenes than see her give birth to that again (and three times, too, ugh)
3379	zaphodbrx	2013-05-20	You know, you could just have had Melisandre attach leeches on his arm or something. But no, we need the boob quota!
This scene was so similar to the last week Theon scene that I was really scared for Gendry..

3382	lannistergold	2013-05-20	Yeah, there was any number of ways she could have got Gendry to submit to leeching. Sex just seems to be her first port of call. It kind of saps the mystique out of her character when she's this prepared to get naked, you know?
3383	Jorah the Explorer	2013-05-20	I usually fall towards the critic side with non-book scenes, but I liked it.  Melisandre can seduce me anytime.  Looking back, the scene would have been better had the Theon scene from the previous episode been eliminated though.
3384	Mulled Wino	2013-05-20	Not all that impressed.   Her banging everyone seems played out already. They way she said "ill come see you later" was dumb too
3385	Master Forel's Fro	2013-05-20	Not all that impressed.   Her banging everyone seems played out already. They way she said "ill come see you later" was dumb tooYeah I would have preferred if she visited davos in the dungeons and propositions him.
3386	SerMixalot	2013-05-20	The problem for me was that the whole set up was so convoluted to set up a nude scene.  Why was Stannis worried about Gendry?  Why were they even considering sacrificing him when the leeches are so effective?  Why not get more than 3 leeches.
If I recall correctly from the books, the leeches came from Stannis, the kings were killed then Mel went after Edric.  I just keep asking myself why the scene with Davos and Stannis when Gendry was only to be leeched. I suppose the implication was that Stannis got Mel to change her mind.  Oh well

I just keep asking myself why the scene with Davos and Stannis when Gendry was only to be leeched. I suppose the implication was that Stannis got Mel to change her mind.  Oh wellThey said it right on the screen...Davos (and likely Stannis through Davos) wanted proof of the king's blood power from Gendry (he had already seen it from Stannis) so Melisandre decided to go with the leeches. She only got three leeches because she was not actually doing the killing of kings with them, she is had just seen the death of kings in her visions and was making it seem like this was the cause.A shadow baby from Gendry was never part of the plan -- maybe on the show only Stannis himself can produce the shadow babies, or maybe she knows that making one at Dragonstone is useless due to the proximity issue between shadowbaby and its target.
3388	Master Forel's Fro	2013-05-20	Both book and tv why didnt stannis include tommen surely he knew if Joffrey dies tommen gets crowned?
3389	Reposado	2013-05-20	Just wondering, why was Gendry so afraid of leeches?

Oh wellA ) In the books Edric Storm was leeched, not StannisB ) Why Stannis went to Davos was exactly as Davos said, they both know it's wrong and Stannis wanted Davos to talk him out of it, and then in the leech burning scene Mel flat out states that Davos demanded some type of a demonstration, I don't get how this is confusingC ) Stannis is a frighteningly just man, of course he'd be worried about sacrificing an innocent, he's facing the moral dilemma of sacrificing one for the sake of many (or so he thinks)D ) They don't know leeched are effective, ergo the demonstration. In the books after the leeches they considered sacrificing Edric to wake a dragon, which is why Davos shipped him away, I believe same will happen in the show.E ) 3 leeches because there are 3 kings other than him. There was never any explanation in the books for this either...Both book and tv why didnt stannis include tommen surely he knew if Joffrey dies tommen gets crowned?It was never really explained, but lets assume Mel could only kill people who have crowned themselves king, and Stannis loses Edric and changes his course of action before killing Tommen is considered.

3391	rumple9	2013-05-20	Mel is sooooo hot - literally!
She's gonna have a shadow baby with a bull's head
3392	Greywolf2375	2013-05-20	Firstly: all of those who feel there needs to be a "justification" for nudity, I have trouble seeing as anything more than sex-phobic.No, it's not sexphobic.  It's asking for a reason as to why the source material had the leeches being "effective" when drawn from a nonsexed up 12 year old boy versus requiring Gendry to be sexed up to get the right blood.  That's all.  Changes are fine - many of them have been absolute successes, but some make people shake their heads as to why it was done and also sometimes as to how it was done.One minor thing that did stick out to me was the order Stannis did them in.  We know that he considers everyone not him wearing a crown to be a usurper, but it did lose a little bit of the oomf when Robb wasn't named last.  We don't care about Balon...Joffrey is a shit...but Robb has had a lot more screen time, we've gotten into his head some, I think it would have added some strength to the scene to have it been "and the Usurper...Robb Stark."
3393	Gendels Children	2013-05-20	I personally didn't mind this scene too much... yes there was nudity where there didn't HAVE to be, but really no scene ever HAS TO HAVE nudity, I was just glad the nakedness was plot building, the scene actually went some where. there have been too many other scenes with silly nudity which has not been plot building/advancing at all, people should worry about that... to me, pft ...I don't care about seeing a naked lady on TV, it happens so much now im very blasA about the whole subject... but ... you know, women watch this program too, we wouldn't mind seeing some nice male nudity, so far we have had shirtlessness and bare backs, there are three frontal nudity scenes I can think of in GOT which involved men, one Theon /wacko.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':wacko:' />  two Hodor /shocked.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':shocked:' /> and three some random dude Loras was getting it on with /dunno.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':dunno:' />  ... hm doesn't seem very fair considering the amount of cunny ive seen on GOT so far.... I wasn't asking for much when I wished for maybe Robb or Jon to exercise a little freedom...  but nakedness aside, I didn't mind this as much as I thought I would have, I was happy they kept the leaches, I don't see why so many people wanted her to make a shadow baby... really???? I don't know about anyone else but I don't want to see the same trick pulled over and over again. when GRRM decided to go with leaches and not shadows, no doubt he wanted us to see another side of the magic of R'hllor so it wasn't the same old boring move. I quite liked this addition to the story, I came to terms with the fact they wanted to use Gendry for this and waited to see how the went with it... all in all we havnt lost anything crucial in the plot so its ok. it was at least good for some giggles

3394	Envie	2013-05-20	I'm not sure why everyone's thinking Melisandre had sex with him to create another shadow baby, what do they need another one for this time? They already used the three leeches (thank the seven it wasn't those babies in jars afterall) and named each leech for the next three deaths - so who would the shadowbaby even be for?Personally I think she had sex with him because A) He's hot, and B ) she wanted an easy way to get him tied up and uh...warmed up before doing the leeches.I long ago gave up my annoyance that Melisandre from the books has been changed into some sort of succubus on the show. I think it really lessens her character a great deal this way but sex sells and the actress is hot in a very gothic sort of way so of course it works. She was a lot more mysterious and creepy in the books. I guess I just didn't really need my imagination bashed over the head like they do on the show, but it's ok, I still enjoy it a lot. And Gendry is hot too so I truly didn't mind a little Gendry eye candy there! /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />

I just keep asking myself why the scene with Davos and Stannis when Gendry was only to be leeched. I suppose the implication was that Stannis got Mel to change her mind.  Oh wellYou've got it backwards. Melissandre wants to a full king's-blood sacrifice. Stannis doesn't like the idea, but he's considering it. Davos talks mostly talks Stannis out of it. Melissandre then offers/accepts that she will provide proof of the potency of kings blood. So she leeches Gendry. When the usurpers end up dead, Mel will have proven her ability to Stannis and Davos. Then she will be allowed to sacrifice Gendry properly.
3396	Retorus	2013-05-20	No issue with nudity, I just wish Gendry was naked too.I agree!
3397	WardenOfTheNerds	2013-05-20	Firstly: all of those who feel there needs to be a "justification" for nudity, I have trouble seeing as anything more than sex-phobic. Secondly: if one were to attempt to justify it, I would think it would have something to do with Mel's assertion that fear spoils the blood or something? Like she was talking about with the lambs? I don't know. Either way, I didn't have a problem with it.There has to be justification for every scene, sometimes nudity serves a purpose sometimes it doesn't, and overdoing it is as bad as overdoing any other artistic tool. Not saying i have a big problem with this particular scene, but saying someone is sexophobic because he thinks the nudity wasn't necessary seems rather rude.
3398	SeanF	2013-05-20	I suppose it was a way for Melisandre to combine business and pleasure.  I think we ought to be grateful that the scene didn't finish with Melisandre whipping out a knife, and emulating Ramsay in the previous episode.
3399	Lord Paolo Stark	2013-05-20	that leech in the penis was a tottaly uncalled for

and all that seduction nonsense
3400	The Black Wolf	2013-05-20	While I don't quite get why Melisandre felt the need to seduce Gendry, I guess I can get on board with it... However, I just can't see Stannis being ok with her doing that kind of thing. I mean, surely it must seem like an unnecessarily cruel way to do the whole leech thing. Bastard or no, Gendry is his brother's son and someone that hasn't actually done anything bad at that. It just bothers me that Stannis in the show doesn't even properly question it.

3403	Springs09	2013-05-20	I didn't understand the scene at all. The only bad part of a brilliant episode. I hate the whole taking Gendry to Dragonstone thing anyway, yet this scene seemed to make it even more pointless.First she said don't show the lamb the knife, then she clearly scares him by leeching him against his will. Why did she need to use leeches on him anyway? Hasn't Stannis got any blood left now? And then of course, why would she need to have sex with him...1. Sex is like a battery. They needed some adrenaline, and I doubt they'd make him run a marathon or have a Rocky montage in order to get him in the best position for blood extractionExactly, like last week when I went to give blood and the nurse had sex with me beforehand.
3404	ChromeWeasel	2013-05-20	As in books there are no shadow babies , it's all Voodoo-like stuff, the three deaths , in fact could be considered as coincidental.

He didn't declare himself to be a false king, he's just serving the king as hand. In technical terms Tywin serving a false king is not the same level of crime. Stannis is as much a technicality guy as you can get.

Except the lord of the Dreadfort of course, but he's a sadistic bastard. I thought Gendry's fear was appropriate and reasonable, given the confused circumstances. He'd only met Melisandre a little while back, a woman who seems to know all about him, and she wants to feed, clothe, bathe and sex him? This is not a guy who's been dealt the best cards in life, so he's naturally skeptical. When she started heading downtown, he thought he was going to get sucked. He did, but in a completely disgusting way.

3415	Frumpus	2013-05-20	They are turning Mel into a whoreDoes she need to seduce everyone?This is offensive. If a male character slept with a lot of women, he wouldn't be called a whore. Mel isn't being paid. She's doing only what's necessary to please her god.

3419	Gendels Children	2013-05-20	I guess the the leech from penis would be responsible for Joffery.coz Joff is a dick! haha
3420	Jorah the Explorer	2013-05-20	I agree. They should keep putting in random sex scenes that don't make sense.Mel can be naked all the time for all I care, but why have sex with Gendry? People have every right to discuss why they choose to cut good scenes and lines from the book and put pointless sex scenes in instead without having that stupid 'prude' term tossed about when anyone says anything negative at all about sex scenes.Pointless sex scene would be the one with Theon last episode.  The girls were hot, just like Carice, but it was admittedly ridiculous and unnecessary   This one works, with Mel using her established characterization as a seductress.  It ties in nicely with Gendry's first impression of her, and Mel's buttering him up with the Baratheon speech.  And it involves an important plot progression with the king's blood and leeches.
3421	Jonsblock	2013-05-20	A ) In the books Edric Storm was leeched, not StannisB ) Why Stannis went to Davos was exactly as Davos said, they both know it's wrong and Stannis wanted Davos to talk him out of it, and then in the leech burning scene Mel flat out states that Davos demanded some type of a demonstration, I don't get how this is confusingC ) Stannis is a frighteningly just man, of course he'd be worried about sacrificing an innocent, he's facing the moral dilemma of sacrificing one for the sake of many (or so he thinks)D ) They don't know leeched are effective, ergo the demonstration. In the books after the leeches they considered sacrificing Edric to wake a dragon, which is why Davos shipped him away, I believe same will happen in the show.E ) 3 leeches because there are 3 kings other than him. There was never any explanation in the books for this either...It was never really explained, but lets assume Mel could only kill people who have crowned themselves king, and Stannis loses Edric and changes his course of action before killing Tommen is considered.I think the underlying point that most people miss is that Mel knows the leeches have nothing to do with the three deaths. She has seen the deaths in her visions. She already knows those three are going to die. She's using the leeches as a trick to prove to Stannis and in this case Davos the power of the kings blood. She hopes it will convince Stannis to allow her to burn/sacrifice Gendry.
3422	darksellsword	2013-05-20	I have no problem with sex and always laughed when people joked about how much of it was in the show in the past, but Mellisandre shagging Gendry was the worst of the unnecssary sex scenes so far . There was no justification as to why she did that. If putting him at ease was the goal then it didnt work he was freaked out by the leaches enough to panic and ruin the magic anyway so it was hardly a goodway to get gendrys blood , They could of just rushed at him with guards that would hold him down it would be over and done with in a moment. Im sorry but it was just a poorly written scene that made no sense.
3423	zaphodbrx	2013-05-20	Upon rewatching the scene, I found it very peculiar.
Melisandre uses the lamb to the slaughter analogy to say that the sacrifice shouldn't see it coming. Yet she spoils it by showing Gendry the leeches and making him panic. I mean wtf?
3424	WardenOfTheNerds	2013-05-20	Pointless sex scene would be the one with Theon last episode.

And it involves an important plot progression with the king's blood and leeches.Yes but she is supposed to use sex for a purpose. If she wanted a shadow baby with Gendry, then ok it makes sense. If she wants to leech his penis she can bloody well do it without jumping on his cock.
3425	BluePG	2013-05-20	I'm just saying book Mel was not like thatI tend to agree. Not a huge Mel fan, but she really well and truly believes she is doing the right thing. It's implied in DwD that Stannis shares her bed, but in her own internal dialog she doesn't even really address it.  Meaning, she doesn't think sex is a part of her magic or at least she doesn't think it in her chapters.But at the same time, until I got her POV in DwD this wouldn't have surprised me.
3426	Envie	2013-05-20	Upon rewatching the scene, I found it very peculiar.Melisandre uses the lamb to the slaughter analogy to say that the sacrifice shouldn't see it coming. Yet she spoils it by showing Gendry the leeches and making him panic. I mean wtf?I agree that the point of keeping your victim calm so their blood is not poisoned by fear was not really achieved by seducing him. I think the point was so she could get him into the bindings easily...but honestly they could have just done that with guards, you're right. This scene was clearly written for HBO sex quota and though I don't really mind sex quota scenes, I am definitely disliking Melisandre the Succubus compared to the cool mysterious sorceress she was in the books. /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />
3427	mafalda	2013-05-20	Minus the fact that it was unnecessary, I just felt uncomfortable watching it because Gendry is still a kid in my mind. Also, did the scene look just weird to anyone else? They never actually showed them kissing, and I thought maybe because it was the age difference until I looked up Joe Dempsie on imdb, and fuck he is 25 years old! I feel silly.
Anyways, I wonder what will happen to Gendry now. Do you all think he will try to go back to the Brotherhood? I hope not, after they sold him out like that!
3428	Jorah the Explorer	2013-05-20	Gendry reminded me of Christian Slater in "The Name of the Rose", with the shocked look on his face.  Of course, the latter was real-life-actually getting sexed.
3429	lightbringer333	2013-05-20	i think showmakers dont care about opening credits anymore. there was melisandre and stannis scene since last 2 episode but no dragonstone shown on map and there was no harrenhall or riverrun scene this episode but they showed it on map. wtf .
3430	Which Tyler	2013-05-20	TBH, the way I saw it was that Mel had sex with Gendry because - well, because she wanted to.
She arranged it so that Stannis will walk in just after the act to hurt him, punish him for his lack of faith as it were; whilst expressing her independence from him. Judging by Stannis face, I'd say it worked too.
Absolutely no "reason" to have sex to get the blood flowing etc; just because she wanted to - it's a plenty good enough reason for sex (assuming both partners just want to, that is).
As for Gendry's scepticism - whoever it was must have missed all the dialogue. Gendry was very sceptical about being fed, bathed, clothed etc; it really wasn't just the leeches he was sceptical about.
On which, I'd also be very... concerned about having leeches placed on my genitals; they're a little creepy anyway (and painful if being pulled off rather than allowed to finish); but there? Pretty sure I'd be begging for mercy too.
Out of interest - someone upthread mentioned the oft-repeated moan that we didn't get a full frontal of Gendry, and only see the males shirtless or from behind - which is different to the naked women how? I'm sure we've seen more penises than vaginas so far (3 versus 0 IIRC)

3431	Greywolf2375	2013-05-20	Tywin is not a usurper. He didn't declare himself to be a false king, he's just serving the king as hand. In technical terms Tywin serving a false king is not the same level of crime. Stannis is as much a technicality guy as you can get.I don't think he is talking about it from the standpoint of royal blood,being king, etc but from the standpoint of who the most powerful people opposing Stannis really are/were.  Tywin definitely is at the top of or nearing the top of that list.  From that standpoint he would make a viable leechBBQ option.
3432	Cybvep	2013-05-20	The sex scene was pointless, but Gendry's reaction was believable. At first he was confused, then he got horny and in the end he became scared. Many men would react in the same way. Anyway, I have absolutely no idea why Mel needed to put a leech on his dick. Also, all this talk about sacrifice was strange. In SOS, Mel wanted to sacrifice Edric in order to wake the stone dragon. I don't know, maybe they will mention this later.Mel had sex with Gendry because - well, because she wanted to.... but it only lasted several seconds or so. Then she stopped and went for the leeches.

3433	silentwanderer	2013-05-20	TBH, the way I saw it was that Mel had sex with Gendry because - well, because she wanted to.I saw it as taking the lamb to the slaughter. According to Mel, Gendry's blood couldn't be tainted by fear/adrenaline, so she made sure to extract it it in a way that it wasn't.The leeches in the pubic area were to shock Davos. She wanted to make a point and she did it the most grousome manner possible.I bet Arya's fierceness is starting to look pretty harmless to Gendry right about now.

3434	Young Nan	2013-05-20	She did mention wanting a shadow baby with Gendry.  She made a remark about drawing his essence and birthing it into the world or something to that effect.  Did she change her mind or something, and decide to leech his penis instead?
Overall I thought the scene was sort of confusing.

A demonstration was needed.

Tywin definitely is at the top of or nearing the top of that list.  From that standpoint he would make a viable leechBBQ option.Yes, but that's not the way that STANNIS should see it. He is targeting the usurpers to his throne. Stannis calls them out specifically as 'usurpers' in his curse of vengeance. Tywin is not a usurper. Tywin is therefore not specifically targeted as part of the curse. Stannis is not the kind of person to focus on the subtle nature of who might have the most power behind the scenes. He is an iron-willed guy who lives by the letter of the law.
3437	drayrock	2013-05-20	Dull. And hard to believe that (book) Gendry would fear leeches so much that he begs mercy. /read.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':read:' />  /smug.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':smug:' />agreed
3438	Kernest	2013-05-20	I think the underlying point that most people miss is that Mel knows the leeches have nothing to do with the three deaths. She has seen the deaths in her visions. She already knows those three are going to die. She's using the leeches as a trick to prove to Stannis and in this case Davos the power of the kings blood. She hopes it will convince Stannis to allow her to burn/sacrifice Gendry.That's sort of beside the point, but 100% true.I absolutely believe that Mel saw the deaths in her visions, then just said to Stannis "you know, if we'd do this..." or something to that effect. I was actually kind of disappointed that Mel didn't flat out state that in her book POV, but she did reveal that she's not actually as powerful as people think she is and that most of it is just one big con.
3439	Mammothsbane	2013-05-20	I thought it was weak... but I've hated everything about Dragonstone this season.
3440	pantouflas	2013-05-20	OK, let me repeat what I said earlier since people don't seem to get it yet:
Magic is more potent with love/lust/sex/bodily fluids! It is known. Indeed in many accounts of magic, some or all of these are needed.
This, by the way, is why Stannis was not 'fit' for the purpose. Didn't Mel grab his Baratheon some episodes back and say he was too weak to help her? Mel's magic needs sexy time.
(This is only for Show-Mel, but it is not explicitly refuted in the books either)
3441	superdeluxe	2013-05-20	You know, you could just have had Melisandre attach leeches on his arm or something. But no, we need the boob quota!.When a man is aroused, blood rushes to that region. So it made sense she dropped it onto his member. I swear people.
3442	Lucifer Lightbringer	2013-05-20	OK, let me repeat what I said earlier since people don't seem to get it yet:Magic is more potent with love/lust/sex/bodily fluids! It is known.

I think they are just making Mel's show magic more traditional in the sense of our own 'real world' magical practices. Occultists like Aleister Crowley would often perform bizarre sex acts to lend power to their rituals.People are taking it way too literally. Just because she had sex with him doesn't mean that she wants a shadow baby. It's more symbolic.It's just some good old fashioned sex-magick.Once again, it is totally unnecessary, but it doesn't really have to make a lot of sense. There is a very good chance that both book and show Melisandre are just going through the motions of ritual and symbolism in ways that are not at all effective, much like Aleister Crowley might, but that she is coincidentally getting lucky with results.
3443	Kasrith	2013-05-20	Wait, wait, wait. Wouldn't creating shadowbabies with Gendry be a better option than leeches? Mel needs king's blood for shadowbabies presumably, so if Stannis is a spent force, why didn't she actually just have sex with Gendry?Cause this way it's fast and gets all three done, without waiting to have three dif shadow babies. Would take a while, and prob age Gendry before his time. This way it's done in one shot.
3444	Queen Elsa	2013-05-20	i wonder if people will continue to ship arya/gendry after thisSome will, while some others might start shipping Gendry and Mel.Just wondering, why was Gendry so afraid of leeches? There really was nothing scary about them...They're not scary, but Mel put one on little Gendry. Not fun, and kinda traumatic for first timers.Will Gendry have a shadow baby?Don't think so. The leeches ritual interrupts.

3446	teemo	2013-05-20	There has to be justification for every scene, sometimes nudity serves a purpose sometimes it doesn't, and overdoing it is as bad as overdoing any other artistic tool. Not saying i have a big problem with this particular scene, but saying someone is sexophobic because he thinks the nudity wasn't necessary seems rather rude.Exactly.  And it's untrue.  People are rushing to come defend this scene and pre-attack: "if you don't like it you're a prude or sex-phobic."  Give me a break.  I'm sure as fuck not a prude and didn't enjoy this scene.  It was another way to meet their nudity quota and I thought it was goofy.  I agreed with Ran's opinion on this in his analysis: http://www.westeros..../Book_Spoilers/ The perv producer insists on putting nudity where it doesn't belong and it really shows, making the show embarrass itself at times.  ASOIAF is filled with nudity yet they manage to always make it feel forced and unnecessary.
3447	superdeluxe	2013-05-20	The same can be said about everyone rushing in to denounce the nudity as just as a means to meet this 'Nudity' Quota.  Is that even a real thing?
3448	Young Nan	2013-05-20	She was just talking dirty in her own way...Again, the scene explained itself why she did the leeching. A demonstration was needed.Telling someone you will suck out their essence and birth it into the world = worst dirty talk ever.  LOL.

Where is the pointing 'this' sign when you need it..Incidentally, that last bit is exactly my interpretation of Mel's magic and R'hllor's tricks in the books. Still don't understand why people think he is real..
3451	teemo	2013-05-20	The same can be said about everyone rushing in to denounce the nudity as just as a means to meet this 'Nudity' Quota.  Is that even a real thing?yep.  they have a producer that wants as much as possible and pushes it in at every chance he gets, even if there wasn't meant to be any.
3452	Young Nan	2013-05-20	yep.  they have a producer that wants as much as possible and pushes it in at every chance he gets, even if there wasn't meant to be any.yep, read his interview.  He said he represents the perv audience and the perv audience wants nudity.  He's the one who encouraged them to do full frontal in the Theon torture scene.  I know there isn't really a "quota", but the producer is openly stating that he is adding nudity for the sake of nudity, not to advance the storyline or be artistic.  Its for the pervs, he said so himself.
3453	Winter's Prince	2013-05-20	See that's what I love about this show they don't waste time shooting scenes of people fucking just fuck. Every scene in the show that has a sex scene means something such as Mel and Gendry, Pod, LF's speech when Ros was getting broken in, and Robb and Talisa they all hold a domino to the story.
Now True Blood is entirely different they shoot sex scenes that take up ten minutes of the show and holds little to meaning to the plot at all.
But back to the matter at hand I loved the scene I believe it was the easiest way to extract blood from Gendry because he needed to be relaxed like Mel said to Stannis
3454	Penguin king	2013-05-20	I agree. They should keep putting in random sex scenes that don't make sense.Mel can be naked all the time for all I care, but why have sex with Gendry? People have every right to discuss why they choose to cut good scenes and lines from the book and put pointless sex scenes in instead without having that stupid 'prude' term tossed about when anyone says anything negative at all about sex scenes.Why stop at Mel. I vote season 4 should be filmed with the entire cast naked. Nudity doesn't have to be justified after all.
3455	WiDMNDBAMMD	2013-05-20	Wow, this is definitely not what I was expecting.  I'm not really sure what to think at this point...need time.  And others thoughts.  Opinions?it was almost as bad as Theon's torture.I guess without Davos demanding proof he would've been sacrificed? That would've been really freaking horrible to see.
3456	Jojosh	2013-05-20	They are turning Mel into a whoreDoes she need to seduce everyone?So correct me if I'm wrong but didn't she seduce Stannis and try to seduce davos and jon?I'm not saying she's as flippant as a whore but she is a bit of a seductress and I guess that's what they want her to be in the show a very scary seductress.
3457	Cas Stark	2013-05-20	Oooh boy.  What to say about this.
I guess I will go w/my now standard criticism that it didn't make much sense.  The 'lamb never sees the knife' except when she ties him up and throws the leeches on him? WTF.  Why does Stannis go down to talk to Davos about sacrificing Gendry if it was just a leech deal?  Am I supposed to surmise that off camera was a big dust up about whether it was leeches or burning, and why would that occur off camera.
This was the worst possible amalgamation of the story line with some almost sex and nudity thrown in for good measure, because I guess "the lamb" can see the knife as long she gives him a hard one first. Jesus Wept.
3458	DrRobotnik	2013-05-20	I enjoyed the hell out of it. Carice von Houten is the sexiest actress in series and it would be madness to miss an opportunity like that.
3459	Areo Speedwagon	2013-05-20	and why attach it to his penis?that's was pointlessany body parts would do the jobTake a minute and really think about what you are claiming to know with that statement. And as to some people saying now the audience is going to think the RW is because of Stannis, the RW is not going to happen off screen.  We will hear "Jaime Lannister sends him regards."  We'll probably get a scene where Tywin discusses the plan with someone ipso facto.  If after all that, you choose to believe the Red God works in mysterious ways, that's up to you.  Martin gave us a political and a supernatural explanation and left the belief up to you.  I think the show is going to do the same thing.

If these leeches are meant to be the demise of the king counterparts, then wouldn't Jon be extreamly pissed when he finds out that she had a hand in Roberts end?
As for Gendry, I think she still plans on burning him, once the leeches have run their course if you know what I mean.  It will be at this point that Davos will smuggle him away and tell Stannis to go North.  Just my humble opinion.  As for the nudity, look its how it is and if you are surprised or upset by it at this point, get over it.  I am sure there is something PBS you can watch.

3463	Woel	2013-05-20	I really liked this scene! I think the sex/nudity worked well here, which is something that doesn't happen very often on GoT. As Melisandre said, this was only intended to show Davos her (and according to her, R'hllor's) power. We all know the evidence for those (seeming) powers will start dropping in over the next few episodes. She still intends to sacrifice him "to wake dragons from stone".

3468	jarl the climber	2013-05-20	Both book and tv why didnt stannis include tommen surely he knew if Joffrey dies tommen gets crowned?Because Mel did not really have anything to do with these guys dying, she saw these guys dying off in her fire and it was just a ploy to convince Stannis that he had to give Edric/Gendry to her so she could do whatever it was that she wanted to do with him.
3469	Young Nan	2013-05-20	Because Mel did not really have anything to do with these guys dying, she saw these guys dying off in her fire and it was just a ploy to convince Stannis that he had to give Edric/Gendry to her so she could do whatever it was that she wanted to do with him.This.   I don't understand how people really think she killed all three of them with the leeches.  If it were that easy, why bother with shadowbabies.  Shit, why even bother attacking via the Blackwater.  Even after the Melisandre chapter when she admits that half the stuff she does are tricks with flammable powders and that one needs to keep up the illusion ofhaving greater power than they really have.  It was all a magic show, I thought that was very apparent.which is why I hated this scene, the audience doesn't have enough background to understand what she was doing, so they're gonna think she actually did cause their deaths.
3470	Ondskapsmannen	2013-05-20	I loved this scene, it was really hot. Also interresting, looking forward to see where this leads.
3471	swoosh stark	2013-05-20	If your listen carefully, you can hear thousands of arya/gendrey shippers screaming
3472	ohpooratlas	2013-05-20	I was not nearly as against the idea of Gendry/Mel sex happening as some other book fans on the forum but still did not want to see it (and did not think we'd see it either.)
I ended up feeling completely neutral towards the scene.
It made sense after the conversation regarding not showing the lamb the knife before the slaughter so as not to terrify it and spoil the meat.  Mel seduced him in order to confuse him and subdue him (in addition to presumably getting his blood flowing in all the necessary places).  And then the leeches.
I'm a little confused as to whether or not the leeches are the only thing planned but I guess we'll have to wait and see.
If the end result is Gendry at the Wall with Stanis and co. I'm perfectly okay with this deviation from the books.
3473	ohpooratlas	2013-05-20	This.   I don't understand how people really think she killed all three of them with the leeches.  If it were that easy, why bother with shadowbabies.  Shit, why even bother attacking via the Blackwater.  Even after the Melisandre chapter when she admits that half the stuff she does are tricks with flammable powders and that one needs to keep up the illusion ofhaving greater power than they really have.  It was all a magic show, I thought that was very apparent.which is why I hated this scene, the audience doesn't have enough background to understand what she was doing, so they're gonna think she actually did cause their deaths.I've only read through all of the books once, but if I remember correctly the reader does not necessarily know that her leaches are a "trick" at the time they read about it in ASOS.  Mel's chapter comes in ADWD which is far later down the line.  I think the series is still on pace with the books as far as the mystery aspect of whether her magic is real or not.You have to remember that we're going to get the Bolton betrayal reveal at the wedding and I'm sure we'll have a scene in either episode 9 or 10 where Tywin reveals his role in the  RW as well.  So we'll have opposing forces at work in the show.  Magic vs. political strategy.  And I'm pretty sure that's how it went down in the books as well.

3474	Head of The Ned	2013-05-20	I was not nearly as against the idea of Gendry/Mel sex happening as some other book fans on the forum but still did not want to see it (and did not think we'd see it either.)I ended up feeling completely neutral towards the scene.It made sense after the conversation regarding not showing the lamb the knife before the slaughter so as not to terrify it and spoil the meat.  Mel seduced him in order to confuse him and subdue him (in addition to presumably getting his blood flowing in all the necessary places).  And then the leeches.I'm a little confused as to whether or not the leeches are the only thing planned but I guess we'll have to wait and see.If the end result is Gendry at the Wall with Stanis and co. I'm perfectly okay with this deviation from the books.Agreed. Maybe he will be the one who goes to Winterfell to save "Arya" instead of Mance.Another thing; since we have all seen Yara in the promos does anyone think that Balon's death happens early in the next episode? This would put it in the audiences mind that the blood ritual worked and then of course we get a second death in the same episode. Or do you think it will be episode 10? Because clearly Yara has at least one scene this season and I would assume that scene has to do with Balon's death.

3475	Cas Stark	2013-05-20	Agreed. Maybe he will be the one who goes to Winterfell to save "Arya" instead of Mance.Cause show Mance is too old?  LOL.  I don't really like this plot deviation too much, but if I had to guess I'd guess he ends up back in the riverlands with Brienne and the BWD, becasue unless they turn the Stannis plotline into another love triangle, Gendry has nothing to do for a long, long time plot wise.
3476	Mulled Wino	2013-05-20	BOOK SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!If these leeches are meant to be the demise of the king counterparts, then wouldn't Jon be extreamly pissed when he finds out that she had a hand in Roberts end?As for Gendry, I think she still plans on burning him, once the leeches have run their course if you know what I mean.  It will be at this point that Davos will smuggle him away and tell Stannis to go North.  Just my humble opinion.  As for the nudity, look its how it is and if you are surprised or upset by it at this point, get over it.  I am sure there is something PBS you can watch.huh??????
3477	Areo Speedwagon	2013-05-20	wrong!Ha!I hope not.  I mean, I figured that was the point of the both Jaime and Roose saying the word "regards" as they leave Harrenhal.You have to remember that we're going to get the Bolton betrayal reveal at the wedding and I'm sure we'll have a scene in either episode 9 or 10 where Tywin reveals his role in the  RW as well.

3480	Frey Buffet	2013-05-20	Oh it was ridiculous. I laughed when Stannis and Davos came in looking all serious. Imagine filming that scene and someone asking you later, "So, what've you been up to today then?" Bizarre!

3481	LilJonUmber	2013-05-20	Look, we're all fans of GRRM's work, so naturally we want GOT to get its due.  And the reality is that the never-ending barrage of pointless sex and nudity is more likely to turn viewers off than add new ones.  I mean, every time they throw one of these scenes in the response is anything but positive. Moreover, I have a hard time believing that people actually watch strictly for these scenes, as in, they wouldn't be watching otherwise.  GOT's good enough on its own without having to resort to all these added scenes. It's cheap, divisive, and comically transparent. My general rule of thumb: if the T&A on screen are in the source material, no problem.  But what's that been?  20% ...10% (...less???).

The lack of sex scenes definitely do not ruin a show, however, extra sex scenes that are over the top, ridiculous, and eat up time that could be used for character or story development are irritating.Given the choice between an irrelevant sex scene, and a cool direwolf scene (or something) that contributed to the story, I think many would choose the scene that contributed to the story.

Every time they add a gratuitous sex scene that wasn't in the books, they're simultaneously opting NOT to include one that was. You'd have a hard time convincing me that the precious time devoted to Pod-the-Sex-god, Mel going all Basic Instinct on Gendry, et al, was better spent than instead developing Bran and the Reeds, or Jon, or Cat...or just about anyone else.
People don't want to hear 'quota' but if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck...

Mel and Stannis having sex, fine, it was heavily hinted at in the books, they want to show on screen fine.  Mel and Gendry having sex so she can then tie him up and  leech him is idiotic. Pod in a room full of naked whores when Catelyn Stark has had like 3 lines of dialogue in the last month is idiotic.  More talk of Talisa's butt than of guest right or the missing Frey army is  idiotic.

They also seemed much more natural than in GoT.
Here in GoT, most of the sexscenes are kind of like... just strange and somehow unpleasant. They just dont fit in.
They feel so forced and unnatural. A "here some nudity you fools".

Yeah, you have to go back to season 1 and Dany and Drogo to find a consensual, no money changing hands sex scene, don't you?  Talisa, being an abomination, doesn't count, but even if I count them, that's two consensual non paying couples compared to every other sex scene is either whores or torture/whores

I have more of a problem with the made up, contrived scenes that are taking the place of actual scenes that are important than the fact that they are sexposition scenes.  we've had virtually no direwolves, very little catelyn scenes, and the Robb scenes seem more focused on how hot Talisa looks naked than on anything else.  Its a waste of time, its poor storytelling.  pod: sex machine is by far the stupidest, biggest waste of time scene ever.
3496	silentwanderer	2013-05-20	That's another thing.  The sex scenes aren't even hot, theyre creepy.   I just don't see how Gendry's qualify as a sex scene. He was used as a blood donor in a way that didn't alarm him, so that not to spoil the blood.

Rubbish.

U actually see Melisandre reach down and move her hand as if she were putting him inside her. It was on a par with those lame softcore pornos like they have on cinemax.  And whether you have sex with someone first or not, if you tie them up and start putting leeches all over them, they are going to be kind of alarmed.  He was screaming for mercy while she leeched him. so I don't think Gendry was into it, and his blood was definitely that of a scared person.
3499	silentwanderer	2013-05-20	He seemed kind of alarmed to me, what with the screaming,writhing to get free and begging...Too little too late, the leeches were already extracting his blood.According to Stannis: this was a sacrifice, not a seduction.ETA: Jon and Ygritte in a Cave ("Kissed by Fire") is a sex scene.

3501	silentwanderer	2013-05-20	Better Gendry than his own daughter. Shireen has Stannis's blood too.
Hence why I think Stannis went for Ser Davos (the good thing and the easy thing aren't usually the same thing).

Considering the two giant bags of gold she gave the BWB, surely she could have sweet talked/bribed him into it, or, gee, um, now let me think, made him think he was sick and NEEDED to be leeched, kind of like what another similar person who always wore a red dress and worshiped a fire god did in something I read.....

A misquote AND a typo.  yeesh. As to the sex/nudity, it sucks that there seems to be a quota.  But when we say that time could have been given to Cat or someone else, remember the show always has to play the long game.  Who is going to matter at the end of season 7 or 8?  Not saying it excuses anything, but it's something I keep in mind while watching and it has kept the fact checker in me in check, so to speak (I'm so sorry for that). Lastly, one thing that really hit home for me last night was how cool it is (at least I think so) that we know the darkness is coming, we've seen the White Walkers and wights, but Stannis and Davos have to take it on faith that Mel is telling the truth or right.  And when you walk in on her, nude, having trick seduced a young man and putting a leech on his dick talking about lambs and knives, it doesn't exactly inspire faith that she has a clue as to what her god wants.  For some reason, that never really occurred to me while reading the books.
3506	queenbeesteph	2013-05-20	At first I thought each leech corasponded to  each person who was named.  The "member" leech was for Theon Greyjoy (because of what happens to him while tortured), but then the other two leeches I didn't get. One leech was on his heart (?) and the other just on his chest, so my theory was ruined because Robb's leech should have been on his head or maybe the heart one was for Robb because he married the girl he loved, not a Frey.

I think seeing an insect latching onto your junk would be sufficient reason to yell. Not that I think thus was a good choice per se but when you're hard as a diamond in an ice storm I assume there's a lot if blood to leech in that vicinity.
3512	Springs09	2013-05-20	Pointless sex scene would be the one with Theon last episode.  The girls were hot, just like Carice, but it was admittedly ridiculous and unnecessary   This one works, with Mel using her established characterization as a seductress.  It ties in nicely with Gendry's first impression of her, and Mel's buttering him up with the Baratheon speech.  And it involves an important plot progression with the king's blood and leeches.Both are pointless sex scenes. She could get her point through without sex. She didn't even need Gendry she could use Stannis' blood. It doesn't work at all. Just because she's a 'seductress' doesn't mean she needs to have pointless sex scenes.

3520	Springs09	2013-05-20	See that's what I love about this show they don't waste time shooting scenes of people fucking just fuck. Every scene in the show that has a sex scene means something such as Mel and Gendry, Pod, LF's speech when Ros was getting broken in, and Robb and Talisa they all hold a domino to the story.Now True Blood is entirely different they shoot sex scenes that take up ten minutes of the show and holds little to meaning to the plot at all.But back to the matter at hand I loved the scene I believe it was the easiest way to extract blood from Gendry because he needed to be relaxed like Mel said to StannisWhat exactly did Pod's scenes contribute to the story? Robb and Talisa is a deviation that most people hate, Littlefinger's speech would have been more memorable without the sex (cause now everyone simply remembers it as the sexposition scene) and Mel and Gendry fucking had nothing to do with what was going on.

3522	swoosh stark	2013-05-21	I kept thinking that Arya would not be happy if she knew what went down.i wonder if people will still continue to ship them after this episode?
3523	Anarchosaurus Rex	2013-05-21	That scene was really just an elaborate way of getting Mel naked again, no two ways about it. Mel explained to Stannis that "the lamb" cannot see "the knife" coming because of the fear it elicits, but Gendry definitely "saw the knife coming" as soon as Mel dismounted him, so that whole explanation made no sense.
3524	The Mondrian Oak	2013-05-21	What a total character assassination. I cannot abide a man screaming for having an obscure insect latch onto his boner.Hurray for the 10.000th wrong use of "character assassination"!

I cannot abide a man screaming for having an obscure insect latch onto his boner.Hurray for the 10.000th wrong use of "character assassination"!Please, do mock all the people on this thread who are having a civilized discussion and giving their opinions about a particular scene. And none of them in the 9 pages so far have mentioned the term "character assassination", just so you know; except for of course the two of you who are only using it to mock other people and their opinions, instead or presenting valid arguments against theirs. Oh, and please DarkAndFullOfTurnips do some research, leeches are not insects.

3526	Koi No Yokan	2013-05-21	He's not stupid, he knows 3 leeches won't kill him, so it once again, does not make logical sense that he is screaming and begging over leeches when during actual iminent death torture he faces it with strength and stoicism.Well, two different scenarios. At Harrenhal, Gendry had witnessed numerous tortures and how the Tickler broke their spirits; he obviously told himself during his capture that he would not give them any satisfaction. At Dragonstone, on the other hand, he's confused and unsure about what it is he's doing there. Melisandre starts to "befriend" Gendry, then seduces him; to which he goes along with.Now, if you start having a sex with a woman whom you know to be a "witch" of sorts that suddenly ties you up and starts putting leeches on your body and genitals out of nowhere, would you just sit there quietly?Also, the most important factor of all - it's a television show! It's dramatised for theatrical purposes! People need to chill out about such a minor thing.

It has nothing to do with the poster's opinion on the scene. If you notice, I just spoke about the term. I did not write "what you say is bullshit", or "listen to me while I mock you for your opinion". Because DarkAndFullOfTurnips was using the term ironically. Did you notice it? The term "character assassination" has a very precise meaning, and this was the (imaginary) 10.000th time someone utterly misused it (although on purpose, this time). The fact that a poster did not like the scene is a totally different matter, which I never questioned, nor mocked. You should really lighten up, it's not like these boards are about matters of life and death. And again, I just said nearly noone is using the term for what it means.

Well, I didn't say it was the 10.000th time the term had been misused SPECIFICALLY in this thread. If you look at the thread list, you'll see there's one about the "continued character assassination of Stannis", when nothing of the sort happened; the poster later admitted he misused the term. What I'm saying is that since Ran first used regarding Cat's speech in episode 2, almost everyone has been using it to say "the scene did not meet my taste". The meaning of the term has been clearly explained lots of times on these boards, to prevent further misuse, yet the message has not come across. I'm no teacher to "teach" anything, nor anyone needs me to "teach" them something.I just find it funny that many here use codified terms that now have barely any meaning. Torture porn regarding Theon, moral greyness regarding Tyrion, Mary Sue regarding Margaery, male gaze regarding nude scenes, cringeworthy regarding dialogue, character assassination regarding everyone and everything. I know, explaining things with one's one words is harder. Still, all the above mentioned terms have been repeated and misused so many times, that I find it hard to think "hey, this opinion is really well structured and reliable" when they're used.Again, not that what I think matters even the tiniest bit. That's just what I feel when I read those words again, and again.

Magic is more potent with sex, alchemy, blood etc. This is common folklore.
Bitching about mel... 
talking about pointless nudity...
Was the nudity in the books always justified aswell?
In my opinion there is more ''pointless'' nudity in the books...
Gendry begging for mercy, well... There can be over 100 scenarios in his head right there.
Being leeched untill death might have been one of them. Stop complaining over every detail.

Stop complaining over every detail.I think the issue is 1000 pages compared to 10 episode, the book sex:story ratio balances out whereas they have limited time and budget for the show and they are WASTING it on TOO many UNNECESSARY to the story sex scenes
3536	Khal Porno	2013-05-21	I thought this entire scene was excellent, and definitely one of the better sex scenes in the series.

They are spending too much time on jokes that they could better use to make Tyrion look like an evil douche bag like he is in the books, or having the Hound talk about his depressing backstory or Arya being a stone-cold killer.  There's too much heavy-handed drama to be included for them to be wasting time with levity.
3538	Versiroth	2013-05-21	I'm just glad they got the leech scene in.   Nudity never bothers me, so over all, not a bad scene.
3539	JonCon's Red Beard	2013-05-21	In my opinion there is more ''pointless'' nudity in the books...Agree. Cersei's walk is just a excuse to have her naked and describe her aging body. Idem for the mirysh swamp and Dany and her handmaid/Daario and her dresses with only one boob.

Stop complaining over every detail.I could understand the uproar if we were all tweens sneaking to watch a nude scene the first time, but I assume we are old enough to understand the difference between an actual sex scene and the leeches Melisandre used to perform the spell.Edric Strom was supposed to be burned to death  after they leeched him, so he might have gone though the exact same thing offscreen.Not to mention, the sacrifice is still a very real possibility if the leeches pan out.I'm more concerned about "death by fire is the purest death" when it comes to Gendry.

I think he was just freaked out.My take on this was that you don't know where the leeching is going to end. I wouldnt be worried about a simple leeching, especially in the times where this was considered a health treatment. But I'd be damned nervous after getting tied up, with two lords walking in to watch a demonstration of a witch's powers, where I appear to be the demonstration.
3542	Maizel	2013-05-21	Van Houten is an absolute beauty, I'm not complaining about a few seconds of nudity.
3543	Buzzard16	2013-05-21	My take on this scene is Mel still has every intention of sacrificing Gendry at a later date. This was as she said clearly," He didn't believe in the power of kings blood, he wanted a demonstration." Speaking of Davos. The leeching is the demonstration and fulfills a necessary part of her plan. The seduction was to lull him into a false sense of security so she could strap him down and have the time needed to leech him. He freaks out because he doesn't have any idea where this is going or how it will end since she seems to take all of this with a cavalier attitude. And with this done, he will think the worst is over, again falling into a false sense of security. With no real harm done, and with Stannis and Davos there taking this all in stride, Gendry will feel like they have used him for their purposes. Only the real plan is to sacrifice him.

Only the real plan is to sacrifice him.The sacrifice is still up for negotiation.  Melisandre wants to kill him and indeed had convinced Stannis that sacrifice was the way to go.Davos (the angel on Stannis's shoulder) convinced Stannis that sacrificing an innocent person is wrong.So as a comprimise--and as a display of her power--Melisandre (reluctantly?) agreed to go with the leeches approach.  Then, after the 3 kings Stannis curses through blood magic actually DIE, the implication will be... if his even a little of his blood has this much power, think what wonders we can accomplish if we spill *all* of his blood.I think that Melisandre was probably planning on fucking Gendry either way (whether they sacrificed him or meerely leeched him), because she is a sex-fiend and because virile, lust-filled Kingsblood is more potent.

3545	jugdesh258	2013-05-21	BOOK SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!If these leeches are meant to be the demise of the king counterparts, then wouldn't Jon be extreamly pissed when he finds out that she had a hand in Roberts end?As for Gendry, I think she still plans on burning him, once the leeches have run their course if you know what I mean.  It will be at this point that Davos will smuggle him away and tell Stannis to go North.  Just my humble opinion.  As for the nudity, look its how it is and if you are surprised or upset by it at this point, get over it.  I am sure there is something PBS you can watch.I think it is just the timing that messes things up.  Not going to look it up but I think the leech scene is late on the show with Rob already doomed on his way to the wedding.   I don't think he had accepted his fate before the leech scene in the book.  Really though if someone is cursed then it does not matter the way of it.It is not as if anyone is ever sure the Leech ever worked or is coincidence after the fact so Tywin, frey and Bolton all get the blame.Leeches was demonstration and is not same or in replacement of burining.  Mel wants to burn Gendry because she thinks it will somehow bring the Stone Dragon to life.....although most think it is a prophecy misready as yoda might say
3546	Lady Arwen	2013-05-21	Well maybe the placement of the leeches needs  to be in special places, so  in order to draw a good amount of blood from his lil gendry she needed him to be full mast. /agree.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':agree:' />

Stannis says the leeches didn't really do anything anyway. He makes a remark that the Red Wedding "seemed like Walder Frey's handywork" or something like that.And Mel, IMO foresaw the deaths and then did the leeches to make it look like she had a hand in it.. but I don't think she really did.

3548	ugashep	2013-05-21	The term "sex-phobic" is a new one on me, I don't necessarily care about the nudity, its HBO after all, however I don't think those who dislike gratuitous nudity are all wrong, sometimes sex and nudity in film advances a story and sometimes its just an appeal to our base instincts. If you just want to get your rocks off, go watch a porno, too much useless nudity is kind of like too many fart jokes, its just a lame and low in excess.

3550	NedStark2013	2013-05-21	Nots sure what it is but I think the show is working really hard to make her seem a villain. Yes she did bad things but there are scenes where I think she is a  not so bad person really. I think she truely believes she is serving a God. While I think its a more powerful sorcerer or being like a walker but not per say a God. I think she is being used to aide the walkers return
3551	chris999	2013-05-21	Dull. And hard to believe that (book) Gendry would fear leeches so much that he begs mercy. /read.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':read:' />  /smug.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':smug:' />She put one 'down there' though...I dont think that would be very enjoyable.

I meant no offense and I will get right on that research.Why do I even bother? Did you read all my posts on the matter? I understood the irony of your joke. I know many people here use those terms way too often, and incorrectly. Even I get tired of it sometimes. I know many people here complain about very small details, and sometimes make a big deal out of nothing. I admit I complain about little details, too (accents, Sam not picking up the dagger, inconsistences of the placement of the dragon skulls, Grey Worm understanding the Common Tongue, etc). I don't use those terms, though. The only one I have used is "whitewashing" and only with Tyrion (because I believe it is whitewashing).But what I mean is: the poster who you replied to was giving his opinions on why Gendry shouldn't have screamed. Instead of giving valid arguments back, you just replied with a bad joke. In your joke you use the term "character assassination", which implies he is a whiner, and that he is claiming a "character assassination" has happened; when actually he never said such thing, and when nobody had used that term in this thread. It is mockery, and it's mocking other posters and their opinions about the scene. Your joke was unnecessary and out of place.  That's what I mean, not that you should apologize, or anything. Just understand that replying with that joke to another poster and his arguments, and specifically in this thread, was improper and a bad move.Mate, again, chill out. Granting me your royal pardon makes you look like you're trying to win the internet. Don't.LOL. I'm very calmed down. When did I grant you my pardon, or asked you to apologize? And this is hilarious, isn't it? The same person who told me "Stop it here, please" is the one who continues arguing about the matter. Who is the one that looks like is trying to "win the internet"? I wonder.....

The same person who told me "Stop it here, please" is the one who continues arguing about the matter. Who is the one that looks like is trying to "win the internet"? I wonder....."I'll drop it here, but just because you're asking nicely, but as long as you no don't bring your back jokes here again." We could argue for a thousand posts more, yet neither of us cares any longer. That's it. Noone has won the internet. Everyone will be free to express their point of view, everyone will be free to make jokes you don't find funny, everyone will be free to bring rational arguments. Now, me first, back on topic.

3557	Master Forel's Fro	2013-05-22	Nots sure what it is but I think the show is working really hard to make her seem a villain. Yes she did bad things but there are scenes where I think she is a  not so bad person really. I think she truely believes she is serving a God. While I think its a more powerful sorcerer or being like a walker but not per say a God. I think she is being used to aide the walkers returnThoros was sent to convert Robert baratheon and she's sent to make sure the next king of westeros serves The Lord of light (in the show at least)
3558	Darth Zyroth	2013-05-22	"I'll drop it here, but just because you're asking nicely, but as long as you no don't bring your back jokes here again."I wasn't "granting you my royal pardon" with those lines. I was sealing our agreement on leaving the matter. But seems like we both broke the deal, and we are both terrible at keeping our words.We could argue for a thousand posts more, yet neither of us cares any longer. That's it.

3561	Miodrag	2013-05-22	The irony in my comment was that it's just so typical of the constant negativity and pessimism on these boards ("Character assassination", "White washing", "Male gaze", "gratuitous nudity") to make a big deal out of the stupidest little things.Constant negativity and pessimism? Making big deal out of the stupidest little things? Really?Not so long ago, a number of posters on these very forums were trying to persuade the rest of us that <U+0080><U+009C>Pod the sex god<U+0080><U+009D> scene had some higher meaning, like, Littlefinger settling some debts with Tyrion that way, or Tyrion staging everything to boost Pod<U+0080><U+0099>s self-esteem, or some other crazy theory. It was amazing how far those people were willing to go in order to justify something that was quite ridiculous from the very start. In fact, ridiculous may be an understatement: of all the books and all the movies and all the TV shows that dealt with prostitution in any way, GoT is probably the first ever to come up with whores giving back the money they<U+0080><U+0099>ve been paid in advance. Not one whore, but three of them! And people were actually defending the scene, and in their defense they went the greatest possible lengths. They even argued with Elio, even though he had seen the following episode.If <U+0080><U+009C>constant pessimism<U+0080><U+009D> is something that bothers you, just try to imagine how annoying <U+0080><U+009C>constant optimism<U+0080><U+009D> may be. Even when most irritating, we book-purists are amateurs compared to show-purists and their enthusiasm for each and every on-screen stupidity.

Book purists have a tendency to bash on everything: SHIT SHIT WHITEWASHING SHIT MARY SUE SHIT SHIT TORTURE PORN SHIT CHARACTER ASSASSINATION. Show apologists tend to look for reasons even for silly aspects of the show, even when it's clear they ARE silly or sensless: the Pod stuff was silly (understatement), and many sex scenes are for the sake of nudity. Plots have been changed WITH NO REASONS AT ALL (Robb palling to take Casterly Rock). Many characters have been reduced to their most basic features, and on goes the list, as you wish. And when I watch the show, and realize the potential it had, I too feel a bit disappointed. The reason the show exixts is because of the books. Hardly masterpieces of licterature, but the best fantasy/medieval/para-historic books ever written, to me. The books are, to me, almost flawless. I will never understand why they replaced Jeyne, and I would have loved to see a transposition of book Robb's story.Still, coming here, and seeing thousands of comments that look as if they were written by a flock of angry parrots, all screaming with one voice the same things again and again, like "I HATE TULIZZA ASS, KILL DA BITCH ULREADY or TYRION WHIGHTWASHED, WHERE IZ DA MURAL GREYNESS, or STANNIZ WANTZ MEL, CHARACTER ASSARSEINATION" makes you feel like "switching sides", and root for the show.Another totally different world are those who say: "God, why change Jeyne with Talisa? Why hide Cat in the background? Why not show the Freys leaving?" Those are people with witch I like to discuss matters.And of course, those who apologize the show for every bad move it makes by saying "it was to better adapt the story", when it clearly isn't the case, are as "bad" as those who scream and shout about Ygritte's lack of crooked teeth or Dany's delivery of "Where are my dragons".My two cents.

3564	Miodrag	2013-05-22	So... how sped up have the sword fights looked this season?  We're dying to know.It<U+0080><U+0099>s somewhat tiring to correct you all the time, but OK: sword fights didn<U+0080><U+0099>t only look sped up in previous seasons; they actually were sped up, which you can verify by simply looking at them. And if you keep coming back to that point, I<U+0080><U+0099>ll even start to think you<U+0080><U+0099>re really interested in the matter, even though you always claim it has no importance.And, by the way, there was no speeding up this season. Truth be told, the biggest fights of the season are yet to come, but, if they stay away from speeding up, may we agree that D&D actually improved?
3565	Miodrag	2013-05-22	I tend to agree with you; the fact is that both sides have an extremist approach.Extremism of book-purists is something I could understand. Readership all over the world loved and enjoyed those novels for years and years, and it<U+0080><U+0099>s only natural to compare the show based on those novels with the source material. What is less understandable, to me at least, is the rage against the comparisons. And those who rage are often guilty for making comparisons themselves: like <U+0080><U+009C>this adaptation is much better than other adaptations I saw<U+0080><U+009D>, or <U+0080><U+009C>the show is much better than 99 percent of other TV shows<U+0080><U+009D>... If I am to compare GOT with anything, isn<U+0080><U+0099>t it more logical to compare it to the novels it<U+0080><U+0099>s based on, than to <U+0080><U+009C>99 percent of other shows<U+0080><U+009D>? One is entitled to compare it to whatever one wants, and it<U+0080><U+0099>s true that TV shows get constantly compared between them, but measuring GOT against ASOIAF is quite logical and expected. And it<U+0080><U+0099>s refreshing, because it<U+0080><U+0099>s not often that we have the opportunity to compare countless hours of TV with countless pages of novels.And even when comparing GOT with the rest of TV, shouldn<U+0080><U+0099>t we compare it to the best, like <U+0080><U+009C>The Wire<U+0080><U+009D>, <U+0080><U+009C>The Sopranos<U+0080><U+009D>, <U+0080><U+009C>Breaking Bad<U+0080><U+009D>, <U+0080><U+009C>Mad Men<U+0080><U+009D>, <U+0080><U+009C>Deadwood<U+0080><U+009D>? Not that I like all these shows, but I understand the praise they receive, and their reputation. That should be the standard GOT is measured against, at least in terms of writing. And I<U+0080><U+0099>m not sure GOT would held gloriously in that regard.
3566	poggo	2013-05-22	...Not so long ago, a number of posters on these very forums were trying to persuade the rest of us that <U+0080><U+009C>Pod the sex god<U+0080><U+009D> scene had some higher meaning,...If <U+0080><U+009C>constant pessimism<U+0080><U+009D> is something that bothers you, just try to imagine how annoying <U+0080><U+009C>constant optimism<U+0080><U+009D> may be. Even when most irritating, we book-purists are amateurs compared to show-purists and their enthusiasm for each and every on-screen stupidity.Well... I have to admit, that the <U+0080><U+009C>Pod the sex god<U+0080><U+009D> scene was so stupid, that my brain almost imploded.But its still all a matter of taste really... some people actually like very VERY VERY bad jokes now and then. /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />Yes, I have to admit, that after reading, that even this BS had some apologists... I was deeply disturbed. And for a moment I was even thinking, that these people dont have a brain at all. But well... I mean, dragons arent realistic either, so I guess,we should be a little more tolerant here.Its all just oppinions and none is really better then the other.
3567	Miodrag	2013-05-22	I mean, dragons arent realistic either, so I guess,we should be a little more tolerant here.<U+0080><U+009C>Iliad<U+0080><U+009D> has a number of gods, and a guy who<U+0080><U+0099>s immortal except for his heel. Does it mean that it<U+0080><U+0099>s OK if an adaptation of <U+0080><U+009C>Iliad<U+0080><U+009D> is littered with money-returning whores? <U+0080><U+009C>Hamlet<U+0080><U+009D> has a ghost that actually triggers the main storyline; <U+0080><U+009C>Macbeth<U+0080><U+009D> has witches with their prophecies; <U+0080><U+009C>The Master and Margarita<U+0080><U+009D> is about The Devil and his retinue visiting communist Moscow... And yet, supernatural elements in these stories probably wouldn<U+0080><U+0099>t justify bad writing in screen adaptations.Now, you may think ASOIAF isn<U+0080><U+0099>t a literary masterpiece. I happen to think it is, and we can debate the matter, but this really isn<U+0080><U+0099>t the thread for such a discussion. Much more important is, however, that D&D seemed to think ASOIAF is indeed a masterpiece when they approached it. They acted as the complete opposite of, say, Tim Burton, who directed Batman and then went on to claim he doesn<U+0080><U+0099>t read comic-books at all. D&D were quite outspoken in loving and admiring Martin<U+0080><U+0099>s work. Now, were they honest while expressing nothing but admiration for ASOIAF, or when they came to the conclusion that a TV adaptation of ASOIAF really needs some money-returning whores? Maybe I<U+0080><U+0099>m wrong, but I find these two attitudes mutually exclusive. If adapting <U+0080><U+009C>Iliad<U+0080><U+009D> or <U+0080><U+009C>Hamlet<U+0080><U+009D> or any other story that ranks as a masterpiece in my scale, I<U+0080><U+0099>d never add charity prostitution, nor a priestess that simulates sexual intercourse only to put few leeches on a guy, nor a caricature of a 20th century gay, nor a sellsword obsessed with grammar, nor a wizard who kidnaps three dragons and captures their mother and then gets burned to death, nor would I borrow some bitch from <U+0080><U+009C>Beverly Hills 90210<U+0080><U+009D> and turn her into a medical worker and match her with a medieval king...

3571	Q the Cat	2013-05-22	Thoros was sent to convert Robert baratheon and she's sent to make sure the next king of westeros serves The Lord of light (in the show at least)I hadn't really put that together, although now that you said it - it's obvious.  The Lord of Light sending evangelists to the king(s).  But why not Joffrey?  Maybe The Lord of Light is only interested in the one true king?   Or maybe only Baratheons.

3573	silentwanderer	2013-05-22	Nots sure what it is but I think the show is working really hard to make her seem a villain. Yes she did bad things but there are scenes where I think she is a  not so bad person really. I think she truely believes she is serving a God. While I think its a more powerful sorcerer or being like a walker but not per say a God. I think she is being used to aide the walkers returnThe only reason I believe she's one of "the good guys" is because I understand The Long Night as the longest night of winter.If she's trying to stop it, then she can't be working for the White Walkers

3574	The Mondrian Oak	2013-05-22	What's Mary Sue?A VERY common saying here on these boards. I've seen it used to describe changes made to Tyrion and Maragaery.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Sue
3575	'96Buck	2013-05-22	I don't get the whole needing to kill Robb Stark. His Army with and Stannis alliance would have broken the Lannisters.Stannis, being like brittle iron, will break before he bends.  He is simply unable to come to a prudent accomodation that would compromise his claim to the WHOLE 7 kingdoms.  I suppose to his credit, a lesser man might pretend common cause, then betray Robb once he's on the Iron Throne.Renly had the best view, in my opinion.  It's too bad there's really not much evidence one way or the other how he'd be king, just others' speculation.

Maybe The Lord of Light is only interested in the one true king?

3579	Trinket2	2013-05-22	What was the point of putting a leech on his penis? Is there even greater power in king's penis blood? And considering how frightening Gendry seemed to think those leeches were, it certainly seemed like she was "showing him the knife". And seriously, leeches aren't that scary. And not particularly painful.
I thought the entire scene was ridiculous. I don't have a problem with nudity as long as it fits with the story, but this was absolutely silly. Especially considering that they're cutting all kinds of good dialogue and scenes in order to fit in some boobs and asses.

I also wonder which king corresponded to the penis leech? Robb, because he's been acting like a peen all season?
3581	silentwanderer	2013-05-22	Then again, Gendry is still a virgin.
By definition, anything done to him is scary because he doesn't know what's supposed to happen.

Not only is there nothing in the books that relates to needing to sex up the blood, let alone special engorged penis blood, but clearly if fear ruins the blood, then the blood was ruined so even in context of Mel's own on screen logic it was ridiculous.  And why so much time on the leech set up and so little time on the actual burning of the leeches to kill the 3 kings.  Oh right, sex, penis leeches and nudity are more titilating.  LOL
3583	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-22	You are correct, the entire scene was ridiculous.

LOLLOL you're right, EVERYTHING ABOUT THE SCENE WAS RIDICULOUS. The saying not to scare the 'lamb' because it ruins the blood then TERRIFYING Gendry with her creepy fucking leeches, whilst already having made the point of sacrificing him and NOT leeching him. 'sex up the blood' LOL. seriously a silly scene.
3584	Great Winter Knight	2013-05-22	can anyone tell me of a easier way of getting a young boy to lie down half naked so that I can put some leeches on him.  It is plain to see the Mel doesn't mind sexing it up at any given chance.  I think there is a slight sexual undertone in the red religion.  I mean she made a smoke baby on the map table.
3585	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-22	it was the whole ''scaring ruining blood'' and then her getting him into the mood only to stand up and put leeches on him. yeh, pretty stupid.

LOLI'm not going to tie myself in knots justifying this scene, but I enjoyed it. Hearkened back to sleazy Euro "occult" movies of the 70s (Jess Franco, etc.)  If we're looking for a justification, I would just say this scene has to do with Mel's sense of theater.  She's putting on a show, partly for Stannis & Davos to sell the power of "king's blood".  Anything to make sure they're not thinking straight and put them more in her power.
3588	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-22	i love jesus franco, entertaining sleazy softcore, but Game of Thrones has the potential to be a spectacular TV show, one of the best, so i could do without the sleazy softcore porn thanks.
3589	'96Buck	2013-05-22	The link between sex/blood/magic/worship is well established across human belief for centuries.  It's certainly more reasonable for it to be present than absent in Westeros/Essos as well.  We certainly see the link between Varys' manhood and magic, blood and the Lord of Light repeatedly, temple prostitutes in the Ghiscari region, blood and prophesy with the Dothraki, blood/life/magic with "saving" Khal drogo and the birthing of dragons, etc.
There's certainly no grounds for us to make any sort of definitive statements that the worship of or magic granted by/through R'hollor CANNOT involve sex and as such, Melisandre's actions can't be summarily declared "unnecessary," even if they are portrayed non-canonically.
3590	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-22	but why spend minutes on scenes talking about his sacrifice if he's only being leeched?
3591	Frumpus	2013-05-22	Because he's not only being leeched? He'll be sacrificed in the next couple episodes, though will likely escape thanks to Davos.

If we're going to have sleazy softcore, better Mel than the nudes-for-hire used in Ramsay/Theon last week, who couldn't act their way out of a paper bag.
3594	silentwanderer	2013-05-22	but why spend minutes on scenes talking about his sacrifice if he's only being leeched?Because  the leeches were only to prove a point.When/if they work, Melisandre'll have all the leverage she needs to sacrifice Gendry in front of Davos.

3596	Bannerless Man	2013-05-22	Second time poster here, usually just a lurker but I wanted some input on another aspect of this scene.It seemed that Mel was planning to sacrifice him (as was bluntly stated in the show) and clearly that didn't end up happening. As Stannis enters the room she says "you can blame ser Davos; he didn't believe in the power of King's blood". Does this imply that there was some off-screen dialogue between Stannis and Mel after Stannis seeks counsel from Davos? Did Stannis convince her to do the leeches instead?Perhaps so. Though it does seem to be that immediately after Stannis and Davos talk, Davos gets released.
3597	queenmarg	2013-05-22	General thoughts on the sceneSex scene: I don't have a problem with nudity, but I wish the show was a little more democratic in terms of having male nudity and gay sex scenes. It would just feel like a more realistic portrayal of sex as a natural act, rather than a show of boobs and ass to titillate a young male audience. In her scene with Stannis, Mel tells him that she has slaughtered lambs and they'd never seen the knife coming, so the show explains the purpose of Mel's seducing Gendry. However...Gendry screaming at leeches: ...she seems to have failed because in the end Gendry is obviously afraid and begging for mercy. I think the scene was worsened by having Gendry screaming because of the leeches because 1) Gendry is supposed to have Robert's strength; earlier in Season 2 he's picked by the Tickler for torture and he holds up, and 2) it made it seem like Mel's seduction was unsuccessful. I would have rather seen him uncomfortable rather than screaming like a little girl and a later cutoff of Gendry really frightened at the thought of what else Mel plans on doing with himShadow baby/leech mechanism: As someone else has pointed out, Mel has seen the three deaths on the flames (all of which  Stannis played no causative role in) and is using the leeches to make it seem like her magic caused them to convince Davos/Stannis of the power in Gendry's blood so that Stannis will allow Mel to sacrifice Gendry. This scene, however, made the whole shadow baby + leech mechanism very confusing to non-book readers. My friends asked me why Mel couldn't have just used more leeches or used them on Stannis before his defeat at Blackwater since that seems much easier than waiting for a shadow baby to grow and then having to ship Mel in closer range. Having Stannis name the "victims" made seem like he could have named anyone and should have chosen Tywin or others who deny his claim and have more power in the GoT. I think if Mel had named the three usurper kings this would have hinted at the fact she's just playing Davos and Stannis. But then of course, if these are people she knew would have ended up dying, then we didn't really need the sex scene since it wouldn't have mattered if Gendry's blood was seeped with fear or whatnot...

3598	Great Winter Knight	2013-05-22	Well, if you don't need Mel to be naked and having sex with Gendry then you can drug him and tell him he's sick and needs to be leeched, and then, the lamb really will not see the knife and the blood won't be ruined.but the poison would taint the blood.  The idea is to have the blood in the purist state.  Would you eat chicken or lamb is you know it was poisoned just before it was slaughtered?  Not saying that it couldn't go that way.
3599	jugdesh258	2013-05-22	"you can blame ser Davos; he didn't believe in the power of King's blood".I don't recall any such scene on the show.  The last time Davos and Mel were in a scene, he wanted to ring her neck because she preached victory and those that went to blackwater were toasted Including Davos' son.   Later on in the book there is a discussion after one or two of the kings are dead and it is Davos that says to Stannis it is yet still a coincidence and that it might mean something if the last King dies.  Nonetheless, he cheats Mel out of the sacrifice by sending edric away.Likely others are right.  Mel see things in the flame and is being manipulative.  She is wrong much of the time.  She see things in the flames, misreads the signs, then takes aggressive action to make things she misread happen faster. What do you think would happen if she got her sacrifice here.... nada.  She sees the stone turn to dragons and she even has the only death will provide life line down pact.....but that has already happened somewhere else

Mostly though many here are taking this nudity thing too seriously.  We can be book purists but don't have to be puritans.  My opinion is that this might be one of the few scenes that is not gratuitous....It certainly exists on HBO.....can't deny or defend.  It would seem to me that it fits the character here as some have effectively pointed out.  At least that is what them first rate actresses with heighty ideals say when they go nude in a scene.Leeches are yucky...  I know that I was am more afraid of them in the murky waters of the lake I vacation at over anything else that swims there and that includes eels and snapping turtles.  I am city folk....you won't see me on that swamp people show.  That is for sure.   Really though...  when reading about the leeches, I thought they might be more horrifying then what I might encounter.  Arya describes them fat with blood and that whole idea of tossing them in the file made me think they were a handful more then the real leeches used here.  I mean they were small and slimy.  Stannis would likely drop them or squish them when trying to throw them in the fire

3602	Head of The Ned	2013-05-22	I don't see why people are up in arms about Gendry being afraid of the leeches... I think it was more the combination of being bound by hand and foot after thinking you were going to nut inside a hot ass Melisandre only to have her put some slimy leeches on you (and your cock at full mast) not exactly a good feeling am I right gents? Especially for your first time getting it inCause show Mance is too old?  LOL.  I don't really like this plot deviation too much, but if I had to guess I'd guess he ends up back in the riverlands with Brienne and the BWD, becasue unless they turn the Stannis plotline into another love triangle, Gendry has nothing to do for a long, long time plot wise.No, because show Mance hasn't made it clear (yet) that he infiltrated Winterfell previously... but then again we know very little about Mance in the show. Gendry is one of few people in Westeros who knows what Arya Stark looks like.

3603	shiola	2013-05-22	They don't hurt at all, they secrete an anesthetic into your skin when they latch on, anticoagulants too to make the blood come out easier.  I think he was just freaked out.Huh.  The more you know.Makes sense, though-- even if they don't hurt at all, I wouldn't want one on me...  ESPECIALLY on my vag, kthnx.

3605	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-05-22	I think we're supposed to assume that if the "lamb" is afraid for a period of time before seeing the knife then the blood is tainted, but if they're happy and relaxed and only flinch moments before, the blood hasn't had time to...spoil?
I don't know. Maybe they just didn't care or maybe Mel is just supposed to be kinda freaky and gets some sort of sexual enjoyment out of the whole ritual and her reasoning to Stannis was just to get him off her back. I'm over it. It probably just doesn't make sense.
3606	DemonKing	2013-05-22	Just wondering, why was Gendry so afraid of leeches? There really was nothing scary about them...There have been documented cases of leeches crawling up the eye of penises - if that doesn't scare you you're probably female... /shocked.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':shocked:' /> Personally I found the scene a little gratuitous but I don't mind there being a few differences between the book as that gives some insight into how important certain chearacter's are to the central storyline in GRR's mind.

If the sum is high enough, and it doesn't even have to be ridiculously high, most people would agree without being even half as upset about it as Gendry is in this scene. If fear spoils the blood, this way of doing it certainly spoiled Gendry quite a lot considering how frightened he was by the penis-leech."Gendry, if I give you a gold dragon, can I put three leeches on your arm for a few seconds?" (and yes, an even smaller amount would probably suffice)"Sure, Melisandre, go right ahead."Especially considering that leeching is not painful.Not as dramatic, though, and it doesn't give you the chance to show any boobs or a nekkid Melisandre. But certainly more logical.

The whole Melisandre/Gendry scene was just terrible! It makes no sense at all to me. Mel wants to burn Gendry according to the conversation between Davos and Stannis. But then Davos convinces Stannis of not doing it, so she decides not to do it. So instead she is going to leech him. But is the sex part necessary to leech him?! And does she have to tie him to leech him?! She can just ask him to put the leeches I<U+0080><U+0099>m sure it<U+0080><U+0099>s not a big deal. She talks about the lamb thing, but then Gendry gets freaked out! And why does she have to penis-leech him?! He has blood all over his body! But if the blood is stronger in his cock and has to be from there then, why not put the three down there?! Why only one?! And if she is going to have sex with him then why not just make a shadow baby instead of leeching him?! And then ask Davos to take her to King<U+0080><U+0099>s Landing since is too easy (especially for her) to get very very near to the Red Keep!! Just makes no sense at all<U+0080><U+0080>..

3611	callmedodge	2013-05-23	Don`t like the sex? Who doesn`t like a good fuck? It`s been established if she fucks Stannis he`ll most likely die. Mel has her needs too.
3612	Elric the White Wolf	2013-05-23	I agreed with Linda (and I assume Elio though he doesn't make his opinion directly known) regarding their "Westeros" YouTube review of episode 8 -- the problem with the Gendry scene is that it seems as though the show is throwing in another nude scene not for dramatic necessity but just for laughs (so to speak). And don't get me wrong -- I think Carice van Houten is a sensational beauty. In fact I just watched Black Book again today to admire Carice's excellent acting as well as her beauty (she is especially ravishing as a blonde). 
So of course I don't mind at all seeing her beauty displayed in all of its splendor; and of course Gendry (Joe Dempsie) is a handsome young dude. But beyond all of that -- the scene did not advance the story or add anything significant as far as character development is concerned (we already know that Mel does certain witchcrafty things and will sacrifice others to benefit Stannis and Gendry is still Robert's bastard son) -- two crucial factors as far as the how is concerned in my view because the time is very limited. We just didn't need another sex/torture porn scene, and it did not tell us anything new about Mel or Gendry or even Stannis for that matter.

Every story is about characters and their conflicts. Is Lord of the Rings wrong because it doesn't mention the characters sexual needs? Is The Road? Is The Hobbit? Is Frankenstein? Is The Shawshank Redemption? Is Dante's Inferno? Is Harry Potter? Saying that sex needs to be in it to tell a story that's human is like saying we need to see characters drinking water every hour for the story to be human. And I have no problem with a lot of the sex scenes in Game of Thrones. It's the stupid ones like Ros, Ramsay's girls and Melisandre with Gendry that are annoying.

So obviously sex will be a part of it you want to tell a story that's human.I agree, but sometimes that's a excuse. People also eats due to being human and they use that as a background scene: they're having dinner while they chat or discus a situation, they don't show a character for one minute and a half just sitting there and eating chicken. The problem with sex scenes is that while they're having it, they can't do anything else (except Vyseris and Doreah? Irri?).

Who knows. The scene was weird, but it didn't detract from the episode in my opinion.Didn't get the impression either one of them finished. It's almost like it was playing to (non-reader) audience expectations of Mel making another shadow-baby. (Stannis asks to make another "son" to kill his enemies, Mel says you won't survive- I need someone else.  She grabs Gendry, seduces him, the audience thinks they 100% know what's happening, then "psych!" just needed sexied up blood for the leeches.)Though you could claim she's showing Stannis that the sex is just for the cause (or alternatively trying to make Stannis jealous so he'll be more likely to sign off on burning Gendry), she's really just getting naked for the viewing audience, and Ms. Van Houten is not on the list of people whose nudity I am going to complain about.(did I just end a sentence with a preposition? ...about whose nudity I am going to complain)
3634	Gelis	2013-05-24	IMHO, it wasn't that a "quota" that they needed to fill, although that could have been an issue if that said quota does exist. To me, going from the scene where Mel tells Stannis about the sacrificing the lamb without the animal knowing it's going to die to the sex scene with Gendry is actually kind of needed. Lure him when riches when all he ever knew was of poor working conditions and food, then give him a little taste of sex to comfort him, so that while he is completely unaware and trusts that Mel is actually there to guide him into his little rise in wealth and responsibility in a whole new world that he couldn't have thought of. That pretty much the perfect trap for a guy like Gendry whose still pretty young, has been a loner for pretty much his whole life, and was pulled away from the few friends he's ever had. I myself would have been a sucker for that too when I was about his age in that sort of situation.

But beyond all of that -- the scene did not advance the story or add anything significant as far as character development is concerned (we already know that Mel does certain witchcrafty things and will sacrifice others to benefit Stannis and Gendry is still Robert's bastard son) -- two crucial factors as far as the how is concerned in my view because the time is very limited. We just didn't need another sex/torture porn scene, and it did not tell us anything new about Mel or Gendry or even Stannis for that matter. /agree.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':agree:' />And I love your avatar - Whelan's version of Elric was great!

3636	ServantOnIce	2013-05-25	IMHO, it wasn't that a "quota" that they needed to fill, although that could have been an issue if that said quota does exist. To me, going from the scene where Mel tells Stannis about the sacrificing the lamb without the animal knowing it's going to die to the sex scene with Gendry is actually kind of needed. Lure him when riches when all he ever knew was of poor working conditions and food, then give him a little taste of sex to comfort him, so that while he is completely unaware and trusts that Mel is actually there to guide him into his little rise in wealth and responsibility in a whole new world that he couldn't have thought of. That pretty much the perfect trap for a guy like Gendry whose still pretty young, has been a loner for pretty much his whole life, and was pulled away from the few friends he's ever had. I myself would have been a sucker for that too when I was about his age in that sort of situation.Very Honest, many of us would, including myself.    Great post.
3637	Weeping Sore	2013-05-25	Melisandre needs to be careful or she could have an unplanned shadow pregnancy.  But I'm not sure Gendry's shadow baby would have a burning desire to kill anyone.  It would just kind of go along for the ride and keep it's head down when there was trouble.
3638	LilJonUmber	2013-05-25	...Mel tells Stannis about the sacrificing the lamb without the animal knowing it's going to die to the sex scene with Gendry is actually kind of needed.Sorry, I couldn't disagree more.  That dialogue was clearly thrown in to justify the eventual sex scene they felt compelled to throw in; not the other way around.  And to make matters worse it was poorly executed, as others have mentioned, since Gendry still panicked like crazy.  We and Stannis were made to believe that the whole point of the seduction/charade was to avoid that outcome, but who cares -- Carice is hot.	Sex was used to keep the sheep happy alright; the "sheep," of course, being the show's horny male audience.There's a big difference between effective use of sex and nudity, and the eye-roll inducing variety that GOT seems to consistently produce. For example: I never once even remotely took issue with the use of skin on the Sopranos, and there were busty strippers on poles in a seedy club nearly every episode. It never made a mockery of it. You either see the difference or it can't be explained to you. Just callin' a spade a spade.  But keep being in denial, or accusing people of being uptight prudes, as you see fit.

I just think if we ranked all the nude scenes to date from most dramatically useless/ gratuitous at the top to borderline necessary at the bottom, Mel/Gendry would fall in the lower third.If we accept that the leeches do nothing anyway, that Mel has already seen the three kings die in her flames, then the whole thing is for show, anyway. So the leeches are for showing the "power of King's blood" and the sexy time is for making Stannis jealous and more likely to kill Gendry.If the Sopranos were based on canonical novels where the Bada Bing was a dive whiskey bar full of nothing but broken down old men, there would be similar outrage over boobage in the TV version.And I really was outraged over Ramsay's girls, BTW, as I thought it nearly ruined a brilliantly acted sequence of scenes between Allen & Rheon.
3640	Tommen	2013-05-25	Well maybe the placement of the leeches needs  to be in special places, so  in order to draw a good amount of blood from his lil gendry she needed him to be full mast.I was thinking this too. Remember how Dany placed the dragon eggs at Drogo's heart, head and between his legs on the pyre?

Sheep are those who parrot the opinion they are told to parrot when it comes to all kind of topics, including sex and nudity. We've also seen male nudity, including Jaime, Robb and Gendry, who happen to rank among the most attractive male characters for the "horny sheep female audience", or how would you talk about those girls who tweet about their asses and the "almost-what-we-saw-of-Gendry"?I don't deny that GOT has some eye-rolling sex scenes that were not needed, like in example, Ros and the other prostitute while LF talked about Cat. Or even Theon's three-some-torture, because even if it had a point, it went on for too long and too explicit. But some of them, including Gendry and Mel, are actually good and needed. The exotic charming priestess from the East used flesh and luxury to trap the poor boy.Nudity = Mental and physical vulnerability. Robb with Talisa, Jaime with Brienne, Mel with Gendry. Strong characters naked in front of others, strong characters in a more vulnerable (real or simulated) state.

The whole flow was untie him --> take her clothes off --> tie him up again, and then terrify him with leeches. It made no sense from the show logic any which way: she says the lamb needs to not see the blade, because if it's terrified then it doesn't work as well. So what does she do? Tie him up and terrify him.They could easily have made it logical: say something stupid like "The blood needs to be from an aroused male", and then OK, it'd be silly and obvious, but at least it'd fit the story. Or for that matter just put the leeches on during the act and claim it's her idea of erotic: leeches aren't a big deal and a lot of men would probably think "OK, that's kind of disgusting, but nevermind, look at HER! Yowza!" Instead her whole argument was "We need him to be calm, therefore I'm going to get nekkid and then terrify him." Like few others, I thought the Theon "threesome torture" scene worked (it just should have been shorter and maybe one episode later), but Melisandre/Gendry was just silly. Whatever: it wasn't a disaster, but it was certainly eye-roll inducing, mainly because it completely contradicted the earlier dialogue between Stannis and Mel.

She's mysterious and supposedly has some kind of relationship with Stannis. She can also give birth to shadowbabies, and Stannis wants one, but he's currently too weak to afford one. So the scene is more like :- Tricking the crowd into thinking that she's going to make another shadowbaby ("what you have inside you", "let's fight death together", the quite clear act of putting his penis inside her, etc.)- Some bondage trick. Is it part of the game...or is there anything else?- Gendry is totally tied up and bit shocked. Mel goes to the box and we know what continues.- When Stannis and Davos come in, she's very natural about it. "Blame Ser Davos for wanting a demostration", while still naked. Stannis looks at Gendry concerned...but is it jealousy? How does this act affect him, such a righteous man? Everything for the Lord of Light...I  may remember wrong, but Gendry wasn't terrified until he was getting his blood leeched. Before that, he was just shocked. Aroused people are easy to mislead and trick.

We'll agree to disagree about some people being in denial, but otherwise I'm on board with just about everything else you said. I, too, thought Ramsay's girls and that whole scene was a bit over the top, but necessary to strip Theon of the last remnants of his prideful ways.  The fact that the girls seemed as sadistic as Ramsay could've been handled differently, which is a sentiment that most of us seem to share.

Strong characters naked in front of others, strong characters in a more vulnerable (real or simulated) state.I understand your reasoning about the "stripping down" of characters -- literally and figuratively. The psychology behind it makes a ton of sense, though I suspect that you've put more thought into the inclusions of these scenes than those who actually put them there.Now, I don't want to break down every single scene and put an "agree" or "disagree" next to it, along with my reasoning. So let's just say that the usage of female and male skin has been shameless and shameful.  TBH, I don't have any moral opposition or uptightness to the inclusion of such; and if you went back a few pages (or so), you'd see that my main gripe is that almost none of these scenes are in the book.  And if you add up their collective run time, they've probably replaced about an episode's worth of potential book material that'd be more useful (and less divisive) to all -- readers and unsullied.That, more than anything, is what causes these eyes o' mine to start rollin' when I see these scenes. Not a my poor widdle virgin eyes blanket aversion to them.  BTW:  The "sheep" analogy was in reference to those who blindly follow wherever they're led, offering little-to-no resistance . I.E. wherever the show takes the audience, some will follow without question.

3650	silentwanderer	2013-05-26	Then again, this happened to Edric Storm and not Gendry on the books.And the only reason we can't tell if this was the exact same way in which Melisandre took the blood from Edric is that the scene happened off-screen.All Davos and Stannis saw were the leeches. They weren't there to see what Melisandre did to Edric.
3651	Q the Cat	2013-05-26	Hopefully she didn't hump him like a skank.
3652	Michael Snow	2013-05-26	As in books there are no shadow babies , it's all Voodoo-like stuff, the three deaths , in fact could be considered as coincidental...The three deaths could be coincidental, but there was very definitely a shadow baby in the books. The show does much the same thing - the deaths could still be coincidental.
3653	silentwanderer	2013-05-26	I think the idea on the books - and, hopefully, the show as well - was to leave it ambiguous enough so as not to tell whether the blood actually accomplished anything.
That way, we would never know if the next blood sacrifice would accomplish - if there's one or if it indeed accomplishes - anything.

3654	Impish	2013-05-26	They've established that sexual energy and the "flavour" of the blood plays a part in the magick.  Saying "they could have just come up with some bland excuse to draw some blood from him" or whatever, completely ignores this.And showing "the lamb" a knife, and having them be completely terrified and panicked for their very life, is NOT the state that Gendry was in... not even close.Gendry was primarily in a state of high arousal and excitement.  This was clearly the point of the seduction, hammered home by the specific placement of the third leech.  Certainly there was confusion and fear as well, but Mel attempts to sooth these (She says "You must trust me", she explains to him exactly what she's doing: "I told you there was power in a king's blood", and "don't worry, they won't take much").In fact, one might even make the observation that a certain dash of fear (well below the "mortal terror" threshold) has been known to actually heighten thrill & arousal, get the adrenaline flowing, etc.  Saying that ANY amount of fear "spoils the meat" is assumptive.  You can spoil any dish by putting in too much of an additive, but a lesser amount may in fact be desirable... "just the right level of spice".Everyone is of course entitled to their own interpretation.

Also Edric is much younger then Gendry so it might be a tad to controversial to take the leap that the author had this idea in mind

I think Gendry was freakin out cause at one moment he thinks and most likley was getting some, then the crazy chick ties up his hands and then ties up his feet and hops off.  It would be different if Mel would tie him up and continue to be sexy with him, but she didn't she got off but a rob on and started putting leeches on him.  I mean maybe that is her kinky way but he was never given a safe word, for when things got a little too crazy.He is young.  He most likely thought hell yeah i am gonna get some from this hot cougar, but then out of no where she ties him up.  I am pretty sure most would start to freak out.

3668	silentwanderer	2013-05-29	That's pretty creepy, since she's supposed to be a little kid and he's a grown man.As long as its not Edric the one suffering the leeches this time around, I can get used to see Gendry on his plot.ETA: As to Arya and Gendry, they never went beyond wrestling and bickering on the books. They wouldn't even know how they feel if the show would've never split them.

The context of that discussion was Stannis basically asking, "why are you cleaning him up and treating him nicely? Why not just throw him in a cell while he awaits death?".  People are taking that, and jumping to the conclusion that "ANY amount of fear INSTANTLY spoils the blood"... which is a false equivalence.

3674	silentwanderer	2013-05-30	But she did... she whispered "you must trust me" and then continued to kiss and caress him all over.It made for a neat parallel between them and Arya & The Hound too.Melisandre was pleasant, mysterious, erotic yet she only ended up hurting Gendry.  The Hound, on the other hand, was unpleasant and blunt yet he ended up being the first character who made Arya smile.For someone who insists to rely in our senses to tell what's real from what's not, Melisandre was oddly misleading  and, for someone who insists he's nothing but a killer, the Hound was almost tender as he held Arya on his horse.

3675	Boi	2013-05-31	How did Melisandre even get to the brotherhood? She may be able to see with her flames. Although Dragonstone Keep is above Kings Landing we can see this on the starting map. Maybe there might be a scale for the continent. Errors like Varys knows what Theon did in the Iron Islands and Winterfell next sceen later, his spies must be using teleports. Ravens would take months.The battle of the Black Water in the TV version claimed no Kings Landing navy. Joffery saying where are my ships. Melisandre sails past the Red Keep on route back to Dragonstone avoiding any navy. In Kings Landing Varys spies have said they know of Melsiandre and Stannis converting to R'hllor.. Melisandre making it to the brotherhood's hideout in a time of war is questionable? Avoiding any Tyrells, Lannistars, Starks, the Mountain and every other cutthroat in that reigon.
Away from any of that. Stannis is not jealous as a man or a even a king. Yes he needs Melisandre as much as she needs him, but come on now that is streching it? (Stannis) Look into my eyes and tell me Melisandre, you didn't fuck the Bastard? Davos go get the charcoal where gonna have ourselves a barbcued bastard we even got some firelighter leeches.
The sceen works in as much as a witch would do an occultist ritual. Although as king druid he wouldn't have claimed the rights of her passage?
I vote burn bastard burn. Then we wouldn't see a bastard v bastard showdown where this can only be leading

3676	olibar	2013-05-31	I've always thought Mel was more of a blood mage than a follower of R'hllor.  Or at least, blood magic is where she gets her power from. I think this season has been suggesting that with her reaction to Bedric and this scene.  Perhaps it was her frustration in not being able to do miracles like Thoros that led her to dabble in Blood Magic in the first place.  Visions weren't enough for her, she wanted power.They even hammer the point by having Gendry talk about how this doesn't seem very religious.  So rather than being a pointless scene, I see it as another hint about the origin of Mel's power.From the SOIAF Wiki - A Maegi is a woman of Essos who practices blood magic.[1] Blood magic is very powerful, but enjoys an awful and possibly well-deserved reputation. It is hated, mistrusted and forbidden by the Dothraki, who claim that the Maegi lay with demons. They may sometimes go so far as to kill anyone even assumed to be Maegi, as to prevent said Maegi from 'cursing' them with evil magic. Maegi often show a remarkable capability of telling one's future, usually from a drop of blood.[2] According to Mirri Maz Duur, the word means "wise"
3677	Lord Bronn Stokeworth	2013-05-31	I hated this scene. It made no sense. I mean he is definitely going to be wary of her now. Wouldn't it make more sense to just ask him. "Yes. There is a price to pay. Here. Put on these leeches." This scene was just weird.

I swear there was something in that wine.... Damn, leecchubus..... Awesome power from her Lybrido

3679	Ghosteline	2013-06-01	I didn't get why was Gendry screaming - he only had few leeches on him, that shouldn't be so bad. I mean for me it was a relief to see that, I was afraid Melisandre was about to do something more painful.

I mean for me it was a relief to see that, I was afraid Melisandre was about to do something more painful.Date rape tends to have that effect...Woman's viagra would leave him leeched.... Not to be expected from a glass of wine, when sharing a date with a succubus. Stimulants would leave screaming, innocence not that ab lib.. Burn him don't leech him, Hope Stannis was wearing gloves, Mel did you take a shower afterwards
3681	King's Ruin	2013-06-06	Maybe sex makes the blood extra tasty. Which could be informative of some of the less conventional practices of shepherding in lonely, rural areas.called Wales

I mean for me it was a relief to see that, I was afraid Melisandre was about to do something more painful.At first he was just like 'hey man, I don't want those nasty leeches on me!' then SHE PUT ONE ON HIS NOODLE and THAT's when he started screaming. Wouldn't you scream if some smoking hot witch babe put some fat, Westerosi, GRRM LEECHES on your NOODLE???!!!!

Typical guidelines for this thread:
It's not a place to argue, it's a place for people to vent about anything they want in the show; no nitpick is too big or too small.  It's kind of rude to come on here and chastise people for their rants since this thread is supposed to be somewhat of a safe haven.  There is also a "positive nitpicking" thread and almost every other thread is filled with debate.
Also, making derogatory comments toward actors, creators, etc. (ie., "she is SO ugly" or "I want this writer to die") are against board rules.
3684	Stoned Dragon	2013-05-19	Sam kills a White Walker and LEAVES THE BLADE IN THE SNOW?!?!Daario is just so miscast -- and making him come over BEFORE she sets in motion her own plan to take out the sellswords is going to make her look so much less badass than in the books. Whereas before she was going to win due to cunning, now she is going to win because she was pretty enough to sway Daario to come to her side. I thought wildlings didn't name their children until they were two years old? What was all that naming business between Sam and GillyBest thing in the episode (IMO) was the slight nod to Clifford Geertz with the wink/blink dialoge (yay for thick description!)

3685	teemo	2013-05-19	These aren't necessarily COMPLAINTS, just some of the even small differences I noticed.
The Hound seems much nicer than in the books.  He didn't say "bloody wedding."
Stannis is getting the Littlefinger maniacal laugh.  Is that rubbing off on everyone?
I thought it was weird how Tywin just walked over to Tyrion during the feast and starts talking about his duty to consummate.
What was the point of the Cersei and Loras scene?
The Sansa/Tyrion scene was way over simplified.  Didn't like the Sansa smile.
No witness for Sam the Slayer.
No Robb or Cat, obviously.
I don't like Daario's casting.

3686	Bastard Walder	2013-05-19	Sam kills a White Walker and LEAVES THE BLADE IN THE SNOW?!?!I'm pretty sure he found like half a dozen of the daggers in the box last season.
3687	Garlan Marius	2013-05-19	I don't think it's a nitpick more than an egregious foul, but SANSA KNEELING RUINED THE SCENE.  She needed that strong anti-Lannister showing.  I guess the fanbase that's already anti-Sansa would have despised her more for screwing over the whitewashed showTyrion, but that's one of the single best things she does in the entire series, taken away.
3688	Winter In My Heart	2013-05-19	No Robb and Cat. (Not surprising though.)
I'm not sure about Daario.
I'm not sure how I felt about the Sansa undressing scene. But I doubt they could have really done it much better.
I was a little upset Tywin didn't threaten Tyrion like in the books where saying he could never sleep with another whore or else the whore would be killed.

I forgot this. I really wanted her to not kneel. But people would probably hate her more if she did. Ugh.

I hope they don't have her kneel on top of it, though.I was a little upset Tywin didn't threaten Tyrion like in the books where saying he could never sleep with another whore or else the whore would be killed.He did...in the first episode of the season.
3693	Mark Antony	2013-05-19	Barristan doesn't get to kill the Titans Bastard.
No Robb and Cat!
3694	Stoned Dragon	2013-05-19	Sansa kneeling.  I think it was the first moment I became a book purist.  I threw something at the screen.I literally had to walk away from the TV. I've never done that, but that small gesture said so much in the books. To not include it cheapens her storyline and her (still strong) bitterness over being held hostage.
3695	chimere	2013-05-19	The whole Arya and the Hound scene felt off to me. They're just going along riding over hills and he's like "What you didn't know? Yeah your uncle is getting married it's all everyone is talking about!" I guess I don't know what I expected from them. Also, a really small nitpick that isn't even much of a nitpick, but since they gave the dialouge between Salladhor Saan and Davos to Stannis and Davos, we missed out on "Oh Stannis isn't a kinslayer? Renly will be pleased!" Funniest line in the books imo.

I'm so glad my mother and I watch this separately.I was puzzled by Tywin trolling Tyrion about consummating right in the middle of the wedding feast.  Also with Olenna trolling Loras.

3697	Winter In My Heart	2013-05-19	He did...in the first episode of the season.I seriously doubt most people remember that. What I mean is how it's made super clear in the books that he can only have sex with Sansa now because she's his wife. But eh they did mention it once I just thought it would have been better this episode.
3698	teemo	2013-05-19	I reallllyy was hoping they would at least briefly reintroduce Tommen.  There was definitely a chance there.  Only had to be a few seconds.  He's going to be king next season, damnit.
3699	khazix	2013-05-19	This season lacks character development of Northern Bannermen and Riverlords. Since TV audience didnt get enough time to bond with those characters, I doubt if they would be as shocked and devastated as we were when the RW happens next week.
3700	kephv	2013-05-19	The CGI was usually excellent on the show but gods that sword shattering and Other busting was ugly.Also, making derogatory comments toward actors, creators, etc. (ie., "she is SO ugly" or "I want this writer to die") are against board rules.Sorry, but that was one ugly White Walker /ack.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':ack:' />

3702	Lord Elrosir	2013-05-19	What was the point of the Cersei and Loras scene?To show how Marg and Sansa are dutiful women for marrying people they obviously don't want to, and how Cersei is a c-word.  Thats all I can get from it.
3703	Lord Paolo Stark	2013-05-19	am I the only one who almost have a heart attack when Joffrey appears with a glass of wine?
for a moment I thought they would kill Joffrey before his wedding
3704	kephv	2013-05-19	Hey be nice, he (it?) spent a lot of time looking good that night.I actually like the tree masked Others, to a certain extent. There's no way they'd be able to pull off the inhuman beauty as GRRM imagined them (not without a bigger CGI budget), so I suppose that only left them with the horror element. It looks okay, but there could be a bit more variation.
3705	JonCon's Red Beard	2013-05-19	Sansa walked to her wedding with an expression that could make anyone to think that she just won the lottery of husbands.

3707	bobbybuilderton	2013-05-19	Eh I have small complaints, but otherwise liked the episode
Scenes ended in awkward places to me
Putting the leech on Gendry's penis was totally unnecessary
Daario didn't actually answer why she should trust him. His answer was basically "you should trust me because I do what I want." Which is actually a terrible reason to trust someone if you don't know them and can't predict what they want at any given moment.
3708	Magic 8 Ball	2013-05-19	Gendry screaming like he was in pain when the leech was put on his penis.
You don't feel the leech biting you, they anesthetize you with their saliva.
He could yelp in horror at the idea, but the actor was screaming like he was in actual pain, which wouldn't be the case.

3712	Kasrith	2013-05-19	Didn't expect to have the Hound's "if we hurry up..." line in the show prior to watching, but I can't believe that they took away the 'bloody' foreshadowing since they ended up having it in the show. Disappointing little detail

3717	morgan1028	2013-05-19	oh yea, leech on the penis...  why?  king's blood must be stronger that way?
3718	Lion of Judah	2013-05-19	I thought the scene with Sam being attacked by the walker could have been done better. They made it seem as though the walker came for the baby, only the Others take the boys. Eliminating small characters like Lark the Sisterman, Chett, and Small Paul is understandable in a television production, but they could still remain true to minor details.
3719	silentwanderer	2013-05-19	Did Mel have to do that to Gendry?
He has blood everywhere, there's no need to do that to prove her point. She's right, Davos is not. He gets it, we do. Stop torturing the lad already!
I hope Mathos wasn't the son who said "I don't ever want to die" because that would be just cruel.

3725	cybobbie	2013-05-19	Like many I was upset with Sansa kneeling, but by now I'm more ok with the changes/adaptations than I was in previous seasons and considering how they are portraying Tyrion in the show, it wasn't a total shock. I also didn't like much the open treat that Cersey made to Marg, I mean I think that telling the Rains of Castemeere story was enough treat and more subtle, so they should stop there. Finally the sex scene between Gendry and Melisandre wasn't that necessary IMO.
3726	Angmar	2013-05-19	Sansa kneeling- what the hell
No Robb or Cat. For fuck's sake the RW is at the door we should have them appearing every episode! It seems D&D don't give a fuck for the Starks at all. Anything that isn't their precious Dany or Tyrells or Lannisters gets the cutting floor, ugh.
Too many cut characters/storylines this episode (Jaime, Cat, Brienne, Robb, Jon, Bran, Theon)- the episode felt incredibly short for it.
NO COLDHANDS! What a tease.
3727	congokong	2013-05-19	While I did like the show finally explaining the significance of the Rains of Castamere, what really bothered me was Cersei's threat to Margery and basically saying "we will never be family" to her. Way to burn bridges, Cersei. In this case it's the bridge leading to Highgarden. Normally she has been white-washed into an almost likable character, but D+D all of a sudden took a u-turn and made her worse then she as even in AFFC. Even in that book she tried to hide her dislike for Margery.They really exceeded their booty quota this week. Melisandre fucks Gendry and then binds him and puts the leeches on him, all because she wanted his guard down? It felt like a "MILF torture porn" fantasy. They seriously could have used the leeches without the whole sexual debacle.Stannis' character in the show has always been awful, and this episode was no different. He's a man of duty and honor, and would never just shrug at the murder of an innocent; bastard or no.I get sick of all the raunchy dialogue in the Daenerys scenes (and all the others in fact). If you are going to remove parts of ASOS, take out the sex talk. Certainly don't add to it while removing things that actually advance the plot.Overall, a better episode than last. As a purist, it will never be as good as the first season again I wager.
3728	Pinkie Baelish	2013-05-19	Sam the Slayer was great, but I think it's come too late. We still have Coldhands and the Nightfort left for the season. If they had done Sam the Slayer in the first or second episode, it would have somewhat made up for the lack of the Battle of the Fist. The scene was brilliantly executed overall, but my minor gripe is that I would prefer if Sam killed the WW in front of Grenn, rather than have the cliched nerdy-guy-saves-crush-from-monster thing. But I guess it fleshes out Gilly and Sam's relationship more, and may explain why she falls for him.
3729	TRAVYS	2013-05-19	So show Davos doesn't believe in the gods? That's a bit of character assassination, isn't? He's probably one of the only POV characters in the series that actually has faith.
Also, I wanted to slap Shae for that smug look she made after finding the sheets unbloodied. Are we supposed to be rooting for her and Tyrion? If so, they seriously miscast the role.

Is Daario too hot that's why khalessi needs a bath?
Doesn't need to undress Mel to get some blood from Gendry. Juz sayin'.
Sansa is not a kneeler. "Would you mind?" "Oh sorry, my Lord. I didn't notice the king took the stool."
3734	Dove	2013-05-19	i swear i could literally hear the cries of outrage from here when sansa knelt lol
I would've liked to see her refusing to kneel too, but they kind of wrote themselves into a corner with that by making Tyrion the character he is in the show. Plus making a show of Joffrey taking the stool just to me a dick, and there was just no way for Sansa to act as she did in the books and still be a sympathetic character to like 80% of the audience.
3735	damano	2013-05-19	i dont get why people are so mad about sansa kneeling
she just stood there like an idiot waiting for tyrion to cloak her for a short while before eventually kneeling, that alone is insult enough. any more would have made her character a complete b-word next to cersei, which is not what the show runners are aiming for atleast i dont think.
I just thought it made her look stupid, what did she expect at first? tyrion to fly and cloak her? the fact that she needed tyrion to remind her that hes a dwarf just made her look like a dumbass. and many people already think she is one. lol. sansa. what a joke.
3736	a7neu	2013-05-19	The Hound continues to disappoint. He's supposed to be sharp, cynical, angry, sarcastic, snarky, bitter, MEAN.
NOT nice and conversational.
These were my favorite chapters from the book!! And they've been so poorly realized!!
Sandor is going to screw up Stranger's neck by having Arya sitting across it for hours on end over hill and dale. Could they not find a saddle wide enough for the two of them? Or what it too awkward to ride double squished together? /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
Gendry over reacting to the leeches was also silly. Personally, if I were tied up by that crazy bitch I'd be RELIEVED she only wanted to leech me.
Tyrion should have taken off his clothes.

3741	victim	2013-05-20	Small thing. I would have preferred Stannis to go by the book order of usurpers; Joffrey, Balon, Robb. Robb is the one you really care about, and it stands to reason that hearing his name last would make you go, "Oh shit, no!" Rather the show has put them in the order that they will actually die in, as if that matters.
3742	The Scabbard Of the Morning	2013-05-20	Actually Balon dies first in the books.
3743	Winter In My Heart	2013-05-20	Small thing. I would have preferred Stannis to go by the book order of usurpers; Joffrey, Balon, Robb. Robb is the one you really care about, and it stands to reason that hearing his name last would make you go, "Oh shit, no!" Rather the show has put them in the order that they will actually die in, as if that matters.I agree. It makes it to blatantly obvious what will happen next episode. I'd rather them have kept Robb's name last and just have the subtle hint of the Hound saying 'the bloody wedding'.
3744	Ampris	2013-05-20	Not exactly a nitpick - but Jack Gleeson was great in tonight's episode and it sucks that his character dies soon. Someone mentioned giving Charles Dance a fat suit and making him Manderly, so I think we should dye Jack's hair blue and make him fAegon =)
3745	Madfunkymonkey	2013-05-20	So if Mel can somehow figure out that Gendry is Robert's bastard wouldn't that mean she would know if Jon is Rhaegar son?

3749	Minsc	2013-05-20	Actually Balon dies first in the books.I wonder if we are going to find out about that in the next episode in how we still haven't seen the Asha/Yara scene that was in the season previews.  Only, that could ruin the surprise and shock of the Red Wedding.

3751	Bran's Legs	2013-05-20	Yep, no clue why all that posted 23,003 times. All apologies.
3752	Bran's Legs	2013-05-20	So if Mel can somehow figure out that Gendry is Robert's bastard wouldn't that mean she would know if Jon is Rhaegar son?Are you suggesting Jon should get the leeches treatment?
3753	Madfunkymonkey	2013-05-20	Are you suggesting Jon should get the leeches treatment?No, but if she can somehow tell the parentage of one bastard then why not another.  And it would settle the whole R+L=J debate.
3754	FuriousGeorge	2013-05-20	This thread is called Nitpick without repercussion - in my opinion that means you should be able to be picky without there being any repercusions. It does not, I think, mean that you should be able to get away with outrageous statements, label as deviant characerisations that are obviously in line with the novels, or restate the clearly erroneous, yet quite popular, idea that D&D know next to nothing about ASOIAF. There is literally a comment in this thread complaining about Cersei burning bridges with Margarey so early on in their relationship??!?!?! The mind boggles. This is one of those times where D&D are accused of not understanding something, when it is actually the poster who has not grasped what GRRM was trying to convey through subtext from the very beginning. Cersei and Margarey immediately realise that they are opponents in 'the game', and though they do not go all out on each other srtaight away it is always clear that there is a large degree of enmity. D&D obviously do fudge the emotional dynamic of some relationships and there should be a thread where people can complain about minor changes and character differences but it is so arrogant when it is implied that D&D clearly do not understand ASOIAF because their take on a character is different, especially when their interpretation is based far more on the text than the emotional attachments to some characters that are developed by some sections of the readership.

Little Finger is a perfect example. He isn't subtle at all. I definitely like the threat Cersei made to Marge, but again it wasn't all that subtle either. They're just not good at writing that sort of thing. There's many other things I could say that I in all honesty don't think D&D understand about the series but is rather not go into all of that again. Lack of subtlety is not their strong suit, to put it simply, IMO.

3757	Minsc	2013-05-20	The thing that infuriated me about this episode was quite clearly that they made Sansa kneel for Tyrion, in particular in how there was no need at all for that scene.  Seeing how during Robb and Talisa's wedding last season there was no exchange of cloaks thus there was no need for it at this wedding either.  
Instead, it seems like they stuck it in as how D&D were butthurt Tyrion fanboys who were angry that Sansa didn't kneel for their favorite character thus they decided to rewrite the scene so that he got his proper respect in their adaption of the show.  All while, not caring that they were deleting one of her key moments of strength within the series in how they obviously don't care for her as a separate character.
Moreover, the whole issue of Joffrey stealing Tyrion's stepping stool seemed like an tacked on moment to refocus the audience's sympathies back onto Tyrion rather then risk having them solely focus on Sansa's plight.

3758	The Mondrian Oak	2013-05-20	I thought the scene with Sam being attacked by the walker could have been done better. They made it seem as though the walker came for the baby, only the Others take the boys. Eliminating small characters like Lark the Sisterman, Chett, and Small Paul is understandable in a television production, but they could still remain true to minor details.White Walkers = Others, Wights = Zombies. What you've seen today was an Other. Please, it's been three seasons. Please.

I really don't get it. And Joffrey stealing the stool was so hilariously dickish that I didn't really mind it too much. Kneeling signifies Sansa's dutiful nature, and to be perfectly honest, given the largely sympathetic portrayal of Tyrion, if Sansa refused to kneel, it would have probably made people turn against her. But I do agree with you that they could have done a better job of illustrating Sansa's tragedy in the scene. It was more focused on Tyrion, and while I do think there is room for sympathy for Tyrion in their wedding chapter, most of our sympathy is directed at Sansa. Which is why I think it was a mistake on their part to have Sansa know of the wedding beforehand.

The whole Gendry almost has sex with Melisandre was beyond retarded but at this point retarded is just Step 1 for this show and the writers....

Simply, he is much to white for my tastes which takes away too much of his interesting character in the books.  Furthermore, in the show it comes off way too much that D&D are trying to force Tyrion into being the audience's favorite character and called me a hipster but that kind of treatment of a character just bugs me.Daario was HIDEOUS....what a fracking joke!THIS is supposed to be who Dany will screw after Khal DROGO?

3763	Young Nan	2013-05-20	Well, on the plus side, we didn't see 10 minutes of Theon getting tortured this episode.
On the downside, Melisandre gave Gendry penis leeches.  
Hated the Cersei and Marge scene.  Not very subtle.  +1 for Sansa not kneeling.  They didn't want her to be the one who was a dick to Tyrion so they had Joff be the dick.
3764	Madfunkymonkey	2013-05-20	Well, there are a lot of women posting on EW's review who think is very good looking.
3765	ThePrinceOfSunspear	2013-05-20	First we don't see Renly's peach and now Sansa kneels. This show is doomed.I think that sums it up just perfectly....As for Daario I don't know what books you're reading but aside from his gold tooth, Dany usually describes him as absolutely gorgeous. This guy looks like the product of a semi decent model who mated with Frankenstein and then had some birth defect on top of that....just not at all believable.

That guy with Arya seems nice.She was actually hugging him, not to fall off their horse, but she was holding his back with one hand while she held the horse with the other.Not nitpicking though, I just wanted to point out It was a lovely scene.

3768	The Scabbard Of the Morning	2013-05-20	Well this episode on its own is very good. But I'm still concerned that the RW hasn't been properly set up. 22 minutes of Cat this entire season after 8 episodes is kind of criminal.

She was merely present in the scene(s) and got like one line. I'm curious about the next episode though and what exactly she's talking about of making them loose something the love. Could it be solely referred to the Lannisters? Or also maybe somehow tie into Robb writing a will? Then again I think the will writing ship has sailed...
3772	Turin Turambar	2013-05-20	Barristan doesn't get to kill the Titans Bastard.This. Still I'm waiting for a badass display of skill from show Barristan.
3773	The Knight of Flours	2013-05-20	Arya & Hound <U+0080><U+0093> solid scene to let us know us that Arya is soon to be returned to her mother and brother *hoorah*  The image of Arya riding with the Hound was perfect and her final half-smile.
Dany in Yunkai continues to be of interest, although there's a chance viewers will be thinking 'same story, different city' before too long.  With the Northern accent it almost sounded like the Lieutentant (kudos for the English way of pronouncing this word btw) said 'a pleasure house in Leeds' instead of Lys.  A few weeks ago, Dany had no army and no bonkable lieutenants.  Now things have changed.  Oh and Yunkai does look amazing.
Melisandre, although at times quite understandable <U+0080><U+0093> almost likeable <U+0080><U+0093> sure has a unique pick-up technique.  Buy a young lad from some outlaws, ship him half-way cross the continent giving him the mysterious evil-eye throughout, then bath him and bed him in order to brew his kingsblood to recipe perfection.  I'm not that sure I understand why a leech would need to be deposited in his groin, although I suppose a lot of blood would have been flowing there a moment earlier..
The Davos/Stannis scene was a nice one and well over-due.  Stannis still doesn't seem to have found one  way of pronouncing 'Melisandre' that he likes so, perhaps he should stick to 'red-woman'..
I'm still unsure about the fairness of passing around three coins to choose one where a differently-shaped (ie square) coin is the short-straw...
Sansa and Tyrion worked about as well as it could.  I would have preferred to see Sansa married as in the book <U+0080><U+0093> without really knowing whom the groom would be until her dress had been fitted and a dire-wolf cloak hung around her neck.  But given that the cat is out of the bag in the TV show, the script (including the kneeling) was true to TV Sansa & Tyrion. Thought Joff removing the stool was unnecessary and extra-cheesy though.
The Cersei/Marg scene got the Rains/Reynes of Castamere explained for the Unsullied, but I would have appreciated a more subtle (but no less cutting) put-down from Cersei after her explanation.
Oh yeah <U+0080><U+0093> and returning in chronologicalorder to the Melisandre/leech scene I woulda preferred Stannis to use the order 'Joff/Balon/Robb' in his appeal to the Fire Lord.
I remember reading the Oona Chaplin article about the 'GOT actress that has refused further nude scenes' (which people thought was Emilia) earlier today, so it was ironic to see that the no-nudity clause certainly hadn't been applied to S03E08. The direction on her nipples in the bath-waterline was masterful /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />
I did like reading a review of the episode which said when Daaro promised Dany 'My Sword is Yours, My Life is Yours, My Heart is yours', there was one body-part he forgot to mention...
Sam & Gilly scene was fine, and loved the birds, but I wouldn't have minded seeing Sam have the brains (that is supposed to be his most redeeming feature, right?) to pick up the only weapon he had which might destroy a walker instead of running off into the dark.  You'd think the more-practical Gilly woulda picked it up.
3774	ApathyZer0	2013-05-20	Why do the writers hate Stannis so much? They seem so bent on making him evil in the show it doesn't make any sense. The scene in general doesn't match with his character.
3775	Turin Turambar	2013-05-20	Regarding the last scenes (Sam, Gilly and The Other): why would the ravens/crows bond so well with a White Walker? (in the books it makes sense, being brought there by Coldhands). The WW supposedly hate all living creatures...
3776	Bastard Walder	2013-05-20	I think Shireen is the most evil character on the show. Davos is illiterate, so she gives him a book about Targaryens? What the Hell? Instead of the 'the boy walks to the mat' he has to read 'Aegon Tarygaren the First of His Name rode his black dragon Balerion to Westeros'
what the hell
Also during Mero's coin game why did the whore close her eyes, all she had to do was not look at her hand.

3778	Minsc	2013-05-20	Random Nitpick:
I was disappointed that we didn't get to see more of Shireen in this episode with us hanging out on Dragonstone.
3779	Turin Turambar	2013-05-20	I'm not entirely sure whether Coldhands will be in this season, but if he is, then the ravens could be explained as a warning to Sam and Gilly.Maybe. Otherwise it's hard to imagine how Sam could meet Bran & co.

It has all pictures and like one sentence per page.
3782	Iron Maidenhead	2013-05-20	Tyrion's line to Sansa after she asks "what if she never wants him?"
Instead of saying "thats why they made whores, for men like me" he says a part of the Night's Watch vows???
Just why?
3783	Master Forel's Fro	2013-05-20	sansa kneeling. I knew they were going to ruin that scene.The poor girl doesn't need anymore hate mail, weird question just wondering daario's teeth are they real?
3784	Madfunkymonkey	2013-05-20	The poor girl doesn't need anymore hate mail, weird question just wondering daario's teeth are they real?Well, he is british...
3785	zaphodbrx	2013-05-20	Ok so in this episode they have finally stated Show!Sansa's age. And.. it doesn't make any sense. Sophie Turner isn't fourteen and she doesn't look fourteen. She looks more like twenty.
I always thought Show!Sansa was Joffrey's age which is stated to be 17 ( maybe 18 now ).
3786	teemo	2013-05-20	14 just sounds ludicrous, especially when Sophie looks like a bit older for her age as it is.  She's aging fast (not in a bad way) and doesn't even look that far apart in age from Margaery anymore.  Should have just not said her age like they do with everyone else these days.

3787	Minsc	2013-05-20	I was really looking forward to Shireen/Davos being the Arya/Tywin of this season. The actress is just too adorable to be ignored.They should make an scene around Shireen awkwardly hanging out with Stannis while Ser Onion Knight tries to give him pointers on how to bond with his daughter.
3788	David Selig	2013-05-20	IIRC Sansa was 13 at the start of the show, wasn't she?
3789	Pinkie Baelish	2013-05-20	They should make an scene around Shireen awkwardly hanging out with Stannis while Ser Onion Knight tries to give him pointers on how to bond with his daughter.I support this. Also add a scene where Melisandre gives Selyse tips on how to seduce Stannis, and a later scene where Selyse tries to seduce him, only to have her grammar corrected. Cue the wacky rom-com hijinks!IIRC Sansa was 13 at the start of the show, wasn't she?Yeah, she was, so 14 is probably the right age, chronologically speaking. Still, the actress looks way too old for a 14 year old.

3797	David Selig	2013-05-20	I agree that line was terribleYeah, they replaced the best line from this scene in the books with a terrible one which doesn't even make sense in the situation. Such a shame.
3798	The Pain Yak	2013-05-20	The music they were playing during Tyrion's wedding was like the pseudo-medieval equivalent of Muzak.
3799	Mulled Wino	2013-05-20	These aren't necessarily COMPLAINTS, just some of the even small differences I noticed.The Hound seems much nicer than in the books.  He didn't say "bloody wedding."Stannis is getting the Littlefinger maniacal laugh.  Is that rubbing off on everyone?I thought it was weird how Tywin just walked over to Tyrion during the feast and starts talking about his duty to consummate.What was the point of the Cersei and Loras scene?The Sansa/Tyrion scene was way over simplified.  Didn't like the Sansa smile.No witness for Sam the Slayer.No Robb or Cat, obviously.I don't like Daario's casting.no robb or cat is a blessing, that story needs to be put out of its misery.  Its truly hopeless.
3800	Mulled Wino	2013-05-20	Has Barristan done anything yet that shows off his badass nature?he teleported out of jorah's bear hug just in time to kill a manticore
3801	Master Forel's Fro	2013-05-20	no robb or cat is a blessing, that story needs to be put out of its misery.  Its truly hopeless.That why I'm looking forward to the RW, three seasons of slow, painful death finally the torture will end.

3803	lannistergold	2013-05-20	The last scene: I can see a White Walker breaking Sam's sword, but making the entire blade shatter into tiny pieces? It was a bit over the top.

"For Robert!" he shouted, and he came up snarling, lifting the frost-covered longsword with both hands and swinging it around in a flat sidearm slash with all his weight behind it. The Other's parry was almost lazy.When the blades touched, the steel shattered. A scream echoed through the forest night, and the longsword shivered into a hundred brittle pieces, the shards scattering like a rain of needles."

3807	SerMixalot	2013-05-20	I think that sums it up just perfectly....As for Daario I don't know what books you're reading but aside from his gold tooth, Dany usually describes him as absolutely gorgeous. This guy looks like the product of a semi decent model who mated with Frankenstein and then had some birth defect on top of that....just not at all believable.It looks like Dany is falling for Fabio.

Sounds about right.
3810	Loras Stan	2013-05-20	I don't even think this is a nitpick anymore, but I'm pretty much done with the show, unless I skip scenes with Loras in it. I'm at the point where I can't handle how they've destroyed his character. He may not be the brightest creature in the bunch, but he isn't such a vapid, shallow idiot as they are making him. This, paired with the lack of brothers--I don't want to know what they are going to do with him in the future. especially if Finn Jones's interviews are to be believed.

3813	Joyful Union	2013-05-20	My only complaint this episode is that they came so close to including one of my favorite lines, then they left it out!
Books: "What is the life of one bastard boy, against the Kingdom?" - Stannis
            "Everything" - Davos
Show: "What is one bastard boy, against the Kingdom?" - Stannis
            *silence*   - Davos
Hopefully they'll incorporate later.
3814	Lord Commander Coulson	2013-05-20	Personally, I found the Night's Watch line by Tyrion to be fitting and funny. Didn't have many problems with this episode at all, but I didn't like how obvious Cersei was with Margaery, a more subtle explanation of the song would have been enough.
I do feel like they're not really displaying the fact that the Seven Kingdoms is embroiled in a destructive civil war enough, as well. All the Kings have sat about talking all season, which I wouldn't mind if there was more mention of battle lines shifting and progressing. Heck, Balon has done nothing since his appearence in season 2, I don't see why anyone is going to care about his death.
3815	Khal Tommen	2013-05-20	Im alittle disappointed the Titans Bastard died by Daario, and not being ripped apart by hundreds of slaves, but meh.
3816	Masamune	2013-05-20	Why do the writers hate Stannis so much? They seem so bent on making him evil in the show it doesn't make any sense. The scene in general doesn't match with his character.Neither of D&D like Stannis. I believe it was Weiss himself who said Stannis would be a terrible king. It's a shame that they've let their own prejudice creep into the characterization instead of honouring the source material.
3817	Mulled Wino	2013-05-20	I was a tad annoyed that no one punched joff in the face.  Same old story though.  He needs a face punch or 3.  Gleason killing it.

I knew they'd do that when it didn't happen in the first episode, but it's so disappointing!
3822	The Pain Yak	2013-05-20	I can assure you that Stannis is not the person most people on this forum seem to think he is.Stannis worship is overblown on these forums, even though I support the man over his alternatives. Yet portraying him as an outright villain is just plain wrong, a serious writing fumble that makes Davos' devotion to the man look absurd .Like Tyrion, he's one of the great 'grey' characters of the series, interesting precisely because he can't be pigeon-holed as a monster or a hero. Writing him as too overtly evil is just as bad as writing Tyrion too overtly good.

3825	FuriousGeorge	2013-05-20	Okay "George".I don't have to be George Martin to know that Stannis is not the harbinger of justice that people want to believe he is.

Plus, she's not as smart as she thinks she is and probably thought the threat wasn't clear /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />.So as a scene in general, I thought it was stupid/amusing, but as character adaptation I thought it was in line with Cersei

The other day I was offering 4/6 that Stannis sits the Iron Throne at any point during the next two novels if your interested?
3837	lostinwesteros	2013-05-20	The Mel/Gendry scene is my huge nitpick - stupid, and for what except to give Davos still one more reason to be horrified by and mistrustful of Mel, and to give Stannis one more instance of being practically turned into a zombie by Mel.  Stannis is far from a favorite character of mine but it seems the show is making him out to be a weak imbecile.  I did like Stannis this episode, though, when he went down to free Davos - there he was shown to have more sense and human decency.
Small nitpic -- that Sam left the dragonglass behind and that the Other looked just like the one Sam saw from behind the rock last season.  We know from the book that they don't all look alike . . .  they keep the appearance that they had in life.

3848	Joyful Union	2013-05-20	Small nitpic -- that Sam left the dragonglass behind and that the Other looked just like the one Sam saw from behind the rock last season.  We know from the book that they don't all look alike . . .  they keep the appearance that they had in life.I dont think the WW/Others who appeared have been differentiated in the books or the show yet.Wait, the Others are dead? You sure your not confusing your wights and white walkers here?
3849	WardenOfTheNerds	2013-05-20	Leeching Gendry's penis was at least rather weird. Cersei outright threatening Marg with strangling was pretty bad. And yeah, if Daario can just walk into Dany's toilet, armed and everything, i think Jorah and Barristan can pretty much be fired.
3850	Talbot	2013-05-20	I was furious when they depicted the ravens' coloring at the end to be of an "anomaly" black as compared to the "obsidian" they were in the books.
Absolutely ruined the episode at me, I threw my book at my television.
3851	Mother of Mini Dragons	2013-05-20	I really liked this episode. I'll have to do my second viewing for any deeper criticisms. The only thing that stands out in my mind as being odd is the whole Mel & Gendry thing.  I think, in general, that the Stannis storyline has not been elaborated more clearly and this scene only added to the confusion being created.

3852	The Mondrian Oak	2013-05-20	I dont think the WW/Others who appeared have been differentiated in the books or the show yet.Wait, the Others are dead?You sure your not confusing your wights and white walkers here?Three years, three seasons, and half the viewers (including a large portion of book readers) have not yet understood that Others and Wights are two different entities. Sigh.
3853	mafalda	2013-05-20	I like a sex scene as much as the next person, but wtf with the Orgy on Dragonstone?!!? Why was it necessary for them to have sex, unless she just purely wanted to tap that (which is gross because Gendry is still a kid in my mind, just like in the books. Older than arya, but still a kid practically) and Mel is goodness knows how old (not saying she looks old because she looks great! but who knows what kind of magic she works to keep herself looking like that). Then Stannis and Davos just waltzed in without knocking and watched. The whole scene was dumb. This scene, and the two fisting whores from S1 are the worst sex scenes.
And where the fuck is Robb and Cat? They've been totally pushed aside this season. Last episode, poor Cat only got half a line (before ignorant Blackfish cut her off to talk about wet shit, dumbest thing ever) and who knows before that. The only dialogue I can really remember from her is that stupid monologue about Jon with Talisa. She is a POV character who's been reduced to one line every other ep. I hate Talisa now more than ever because time that could be spent on Cat is spent on her naked ass writing letters and shit.

3855	Lord Paolo Stark	2013-05-20	I also, as a lot of people here, think that it was not necessary to put a leech in Gendry's penis and all the seduction part, tottaly uncalled for
the seduction and sex are part of Martin's world, but they are overrating it in the show, like, it's important to have sex scenes every episode /dunno.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':dunno:' />
I think they could at least give Davos one or two more sons, not just Mathos, with that they are killing House Seaworth
the same way I think about cutting Willas and Garlan Tyrell, they could at least been mentioned, but not cut as they never existed
3856	Hatting	2013-05-20	I'm really surprised how Dany can still be alive with the poor protection she's having. Just kill an unsullied, dress in his armor and walk right in. At least in the book he was captured as a spy. 
Also, I can't really remember when it happens in the book but Tyrion has really given up. The scene with Sansa before the wedding he had no clue what to say, stubling over the words not able to get his point hrough. Was he like that in the book? Lately I havent found much reason to cheer for Tyrion.
3857	Darth Zyroth	2013-05-20	Ok, just watched the episode....*sight* I just cannot nitpick anymore.......... For now I just have a few:- Why is Arya riding like that??!!! That's going to severely hurt Stranger's neck!!!!!- Where is THE HOUND??! Where is THIS Hound???!!- The coin game was stupid. The girl can feel the coins. She knows who is getting what. That's not exactly "fair".- Sansa kneeling.....- Sansa not having a maiden cloak with the colors of her family, or at least Stark colors in her dress,   - Joffrey saying "I suppose it doesn't really matter which Lannister puts the baby into you". Doesn't he consider himself more a Baratheon than a Lannister??- IIRC the word "last name" doesn't exist in Westeros. That's all for now. Right now I just don't have enough energy to keep nitpicking. Maybe later......

3860	WhatIsDeadMayNeverLive	2013-05-20	No Robb and Cat. When Sandor told Arya he's taking her to the wedding it was a perfect moment to give us a scene with Robb and Cat. They did a horrible job with them this season and I thought they will at least repair some damage this episode but no, they didn't even get one scene. I don't know about you but RW will have absolutely no impact on me.
3861	Young Nan	2013-05-20	The Mel/Gendry scene is my huge nitpick - stupid, and for what except to give Davos still one more reason to be horrified by and mistrustful of Mel, and to give Stannis one more instance of being practically turned into a zombie by Mel.  Stannis is far from a favorite character of mine but it seems the show is making him out to be a weak imbecile.  I did like Stannis this episode, though, when he went down to free Davos - there he was shown to have more sense and human decency.Small nitpic -- that Sam left the dragonglass behind and that the Other looked just like the one Sam saw from behind the rock last season.  We know from the book that they don't all look alike . . .  they keep the appearance that they had in life.Coldhands!  I totally forgot about Coldhands!   OK, now I change my biggest nitpick vote to "No Coldhands"!!!!!Yes and Yes!The Mel and Gendry scene was cringeworthy.  Seems she wants to burn him, make a shadowbaby with him, and stick leeches on his penis, all at once.   Glad they had Stannis talk to Davos in the dungeon, but sad they didn't have Davos answer "everything" when Stannis asked what one boy was worth against a whole kingdom.And no Coldhands makes me sad.  Basically they combined the Waymar Royce prologue with the Sam fighting Small Paul's wight scene.  I think we'll still see him though, maybe he'll come in later with Bran.
3862	Pixi Penrose	2013-05-20	Small thing. I would have preferred Stannis to go by the book order of usurpers; Joffrey, Balon, Robb. Robb is the one you really care about, and it stands to reason that hearing his name last would make you go, "Oh shit, no!" Rather the show has put them in the order that they will actually die in, as if that matters.Yup, I agree..BTW: Totally off topic, but I really love your profile pic,where is it from,or who did it?
3863	bobbybuilderton	2013-05-20	I forgot my last nitpick, which is that the reference to guest right was soooo underplayed. I guess that will just make it decent foreshadowing for unsullied in hindsight, but still...
In case anyone didn't catch it, it was when Grey Worm offered to kill that douchebag.

Was it a mistake or is he learning individuality?
3865	piratesswoop	2013-05-20	Tyrion's line to Sansa after she asks "what if she never wants him?"Instead of saying "thats why they made whores, for men like me" he says a part of the Night's Watch vows???Just why?It was a ridiculous line and imo, just further contributes to showing Tyrion's whitewashing. Instead of the line about whores, he's telling Sansa if she won't sleep with him, well then he'll just never have sex again. Except now he's lying, because what about Shae? What a lovely guy. /ack.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':ack:' />

But since I don't speak Valiryan, then I'll blame it in the subtitles. Maybe he did say "This One", but the subtitles were wrong. Maybe.......Another nitpick:- Mero doesn't have a Braavosi accent!!!And now to sleep!

3868	ThePrinceOfSunspear	2013-05-20	From the first post in this thread: Also, making derogatory comments toward actors, creators, etc. (ie., "she is SO ugly" or "I want this writer to die") are against board rules.That's not a derogatory comment. That's my reaction to what the dumb show is presenting in comparison to what the source material says about the characters on this show. I'm simply pointing out the truth.  Its not my fault nor should I get in trouble for stating the fact that.1) Khal Drogo was played by a very handsome looking guy in Season 1.2) The books explicitly state several times that Daario has pretty eyes and overall is a very attractive person (in Danys eyes). Even Ser Barristan in ADWD admits that he knows why Dany is drawn to him as opposed to Quentyn Martell.3) The actor they got to play Daario in this last episode looks very very weird (and that's just putting it politically correct so that little babies like you won't report me for saying what we're ALL thinking).But hey continue to live in that delusional world where the show is absolutely perfect and nothing has gone wrong....

Second, saying that someone is the result of someone who "mated with Frankenstein and then had some birth defect on top of that" is a perfect example of a derogatory comment. Feel free to hate the translation on screen of the character, but what you said was a direct insult to the actor's phisical features.

For Barristan, especially, having him rush to Dany's defense would have been a fine chance to remind the audience that he was the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, sworn to give his life for hers if necessary. Instead, Daario sneaks into camp unopposed and Barristan is nowhere to be seen. I now find myself wondering if Show Cersei and Joffrey may have had a legitimate point when they packed him off into retirement.

And, um, stupid.  If this was what they were going to do with the leech storyline, why not leave it out.  It isn't as if they even built up the actual burning with any ominous dialogue or music.  Who cares?  The lamb never sees the knife, eh? I can't imagine a worse mess of trying to throw in every angle there with Mel and of course, she has to take all her clothes off as well.  What in the hell is Stannis upset about if she's only going to leech him?  Was there a big convo off screen?  Why is Gendry flipping out, they are only leeches, grow up kid, you're lucky she didn't set you fire.  Stupid.  Stupid. Stupid.Lack of Robb and Cat at this point isn't even a nit pick, let's just get it over with so we can get back to the Tyrion Dinklage and Daenarys Targaryen show.

3886	Angmar	2013-05-20	I'm not looking forward to Dany and Daario's romance on screen. He's so bland and it's gonna be the main couple of season ADWD ala Jon/Ygritte this season and it'll be so cheesy. =P
Also I don't get him- he switches sides mostly because he's swooning over Dany's beauty? Nothing else? Blegh.
I only liked the Gendry-Mel scene because Gendry/Arya fans were losing their shit. Lol. Otherwise it was fucking crazy...Leeches!
Missandei's talk about Dothraki being a harsh language. What was the point of that line?
Also dunno but it's getting repetitive in Dany's story that "the villain is a huge mysoginist" trope. First Kraznys now Mero.

The build-up to the Red Wedding should have been the perfect time for Catelyn to regain the spotlight: to emphasize her fear, her growing desperation, her desire to protect her last child at any cost. It should have been a time to show that Catelyn, above all, desires peace and the safety of her children, even as she loses her children one by one. The desperate situation of the northern rebellion could have been emphasized with a scene showing Catelyn's despairing attempt to convince Robb that bending the knee may be the last real option he has. Instead, one episode short of RW, she has no scenes whatsoever. The rest of the season she has barely made her presence felt. And now, going into Episode 9 and her last moment to show who she is before she turns into LS, we have a preview of her basically urging her son to keep fighting ("Show them how it feels to lose what they love!").It irritates me. The Starks have really been given the shaft this season and the impact of RW will suffer for it.
3889	Cas Stark	2013-05-20	She decided to leech him to prove the power of King's Blood to Stannis and Davos. It was a compromiseHow would anyone watching the show possibly figure that out?  Why not show that conversation on screen....the dynamic between the three...Stannis, wants to be king, but not a bad guy, Mel, wants to burn the kid because, hey, that's what Red Dress does, and Davos, as ever, the conscience of the king.  That might have been interesting and character deepening.Instead we got...the lamb doesn't see the knife, a scene w/Stannis and Davos that appeared to be about killing Gendry, then Gendry and Mel getting it on so she could tie him up and leech him, the stupid hurts.

You're a guy, yet you're the most radical feminist on the board.That doesn't sound like a feminist; it sounds like someone (like me) who feels the booty quota is too high.Very true. Barristan needs to do something else than throw comments like "hoho bedslaves, we can easily defeat them", "hoho they fight for gold, i despise them". Their lack of subtlety manifests itself in Barristan's annoying comments imho.Wouldn't it be funny if at some point Dany says to him "Now I know why Joffrey threw you out of the Kingsguard." With this show, I wouldn't be too surprised if they put that in. I mean, I never thought Cersei would make an enemy outright of Margery. In the books she never revealed her true feelings.
3891	gash	2013-05-20	I literally had to walk away from the TV.I've never done that, but that small gesture said so much in the books. To not include it cheapens her storyline and her (still strong) bitterness over being held hostage.she kneels in the book.not as soon as in the tv show, but she does kneel.When Sansa turned, the little man was gazing up at her, his mouth tight, his face as red as her cloak. Suddenly she was ashamed of her stubbornness. She smoothed her skirts and knelt in front of him, so their heads were on the same level. "With this kiss I pledge my love, and take you for my lord and husband."

I was so confused.  First Mel's like "the lamb doesn't see the knife, sacrificing Gendry, blah blah".  And then Stannis tells Davos he's planning on sacrificing Gendry.  It was unclear whether Davos' uncomfortable silence convinced him one way or another.  Then, Melisandre is boning Gendry, and she tells him she is going to make a shadow baby with him.  At least that is how I am interpreting the "taking your essence and birthing it into the world" line.  Then, Stannis shows up and looks butthurt that Mel is naked with somebody else.  And then, she starts putting leeches on Gendry's penis.  I really have no idea wtf is going on.  Did they compromise, is that what happened?

3895	nightflyingmouse	2013-05-20	I actually like the tree masked Others, to a certain extent. There's no way they'd be able to pull off the inhuman beauty as GRRM imagined them (not without a bigger CGI budget), so I suppose that only left them with the horror element. It looks okay, but there could be a bit more variation.They should never have fully shown what an Other was like. They could have done a lot with them in white hooded cloaks in the dark, you just see that they "bring the cold with them", lots of ice forming, and see their hands with daggers etc. I was so disappointed when I first saw one. They don't even have any special speed to them. They don't look scary, they look silly. Meh. The only thing I liked was how it shattered.
3896	Young Nan	2013-05-20	Maybe the writers think that the viewers didn't invest so much emotionally in Robb/Catelyn's story as they did with Tyrion or Dany...thus explaining the lack of screen time and character development.I think they just have a hard on for Tyrion and Dany, and devote more scenes to them than anyone else, hence the reason the audience isn't emotionally invested in Robb or Catelyn.
3897	WardenOfTheNerds	2013-05-20	At this point i'm just hoping they won't sew Grey Wind's penis to Robb.
3898	Masamune	2013-05-20	Did Michelle Fairley do something to piss D&D off this season or what? The build-up to the Red Wedding should have been the perfect time for Catelyn to regain the spotlight: to emphasize her fear, her growing desperation, her desire to protect her last child at any cost. It should have been a time to show that Catelyn, above all, desires peace and the safety of her children, even as she loses her children one by one. The desperate situation of the northern rebellion could have been emphasized with a scene showing Catelyn's despairing attempt to convince Robb that bending the knee may be the last real option he has.Instead, one episode short of RW, she has no scenes whatsoever. The rest of the season she has barely made her presence felt. And now, going into Episode 9 and her last moment to show who she is before she turns into LS, we have a preview of her basically urging her son to keep fighting ("Show them how it feels to lose what they love!").It irritates me. The Starks have really been given the shaft this season and the impact of RW will suffer for it.The RW got sidelined for a crappy soap opera romance. It is known.And someone please help me because I'm confused with the show logic. Robb's now planning to invade Lannister HQ and steal all its gold doubloons but first he wants to appease Walder Frey and get some reinforcements. Okaaaay... Wasn't it established in S1 that Walder Frey had only 400 men remaining to guard the Twins. Clearly nowhere near the required numbers to even attempt a siege on Casterly Rock. Whereas in the books, Robb was simply after safe passage to reclaim the North with the remainder of his host. So why exactly is he going back there again? Am I forgetting something here or what?
3899	Cas Stark	2013-05-20	That may very well be what happened, but it was far from clear in the show.Yeah, exactly what I'm saying.  I was so confused.  First Mel's like "the lamb doesn't see the knife, sacrificing Gendry, blah blah".  And then Stannis tells Davos he's planning on sacrificing Gendry.  It was unclear whether Davos' uncomfortable silence convinced him one way or another.  Then, Melisandre is boning Gendry, and she tells him she is going to make a shadow baby with him.  At least that is how I am interpreting the "taking your essence and birthing it into the world" line.  Then, Stannis shows up and looks butthurt that Mel is naked with somebody else.  And then, she starts putting leeches on Gendry's penis.  I really have no idea wtf is going on.  Did they compromise, is that what happened?I guess Season 3 GOT includes an audience participation segment where the audience is invited to write the missing scenes in their own minds....you know, that scene that didn't occur between Mel and Stannis where he refues to burn Gendry and they compromise with the leeches.  I guess TV only viewers may think that you need the sexual energy to make the leeches work, but, SO gratuitious.And it definitely is positioning it that the leech magic is a causitive agent for the death of the three kings because I guarantee you they're going to die in the order he says their names...and it would have been nice if we had the same hesitation on Robb Stark's name as we got in the books...but, no, I guess not, TV Stannis wants Robb dead more than the abomination Joffrey "Baratheon".
3900	Young Nan	2013-05-20	At this point i'm just hoping they won't sew Grey Wind's penis to Robb.They won't, we only get female nudity in the show.  They'll sow Catelyn's teats onto somebody.

I know its still up for debate and such, but IMO, the leeches thing was all for show, I think Melisandre didn't cause anything.  This is going to have the audience convinced that Melisandre's little magic show with the leeches is the cause of Robb, Balon, and Joff's death.
3903	Cas Stark	2013-05-20	I think they just have a hard on for Tyrion and Dany, and devote more scenes to them than anyone else, hence the reason the audience isn't emotionally invested in Robb or Catelyn.Yep.

I try not to read too much into any hints that the show has (or people think it has) about future events in the books, just for the reason that D&D make so many changes that I don't think it is a reliable enough source of information.  Each season the show and books diverge more and more.Hopefully they wouldn't change something that significant, but you never know.

3911	DorneToTheWall	2013-05-20	I really didnt like the Mel sex scene or almost sex scene with Gen.  She seems like she'll spread her legs for anyone.
 I liked Tyrion's response to Sansa about her possibly never wanting him in her bed much more in the book.  For the show Tyrion, it makes him seem more chivalrous i guess.   
I didnt like cersei openly threatening to kill margery. 
The QOT feels out of place, like she's a bad comic relief.  
And i thought that the QOT snapping Tywin's pen meant that she rejected his offer. But in this episode it seems like the marraige will take place.
3912	Turin Turambar	2013-05-20	I just hope the viewers won't hate Gendry now, i mean "IT's TOTALLY THE BLACKSMITH'S PENIS THAT KILLED ROBBB!".I hope that Joffrey gets the junk's leech.
3913	silentwanderer	2013-05-20	I just hope the viewers won't hate Gendry now...Gendry paid the Iron price for it. And not in a good way.Although I reckon Arya will be mad if his blood  kills Joffrey before her sword does.

She's stupid, but not that stupid.For the moment, that scene was just awkward. By the time we reach Feast for Crows material, its going to change the whole dynamic of the Margaery-Cersei rivalry. No longer a prolonged battle of hidden schemes and public passive-aggressiveness, D&D seem to be prepping them to be open enemies.
3916	Lord Paolo Stark	2013-05-20	yes, Gilly didn't mention Free people don't name their kids until age of 2

You know how I know?The majority of their audience is male and most men do not appreciate seeing other men naked when they are not in the company of a naked female. I've observed that women tend to be more comfortable seeing a naked woman, regardless of sexuality. Because they most likely know this, they will not risk alienating a large percentage of their audience by always showing male butts and dicks.Not saying it's right or okay or I think it's a good decision, just that it's probably the truth.
3922	Buckwheat	2013-05-20	Sansa knelt. I hate hate hate this. Sansa does not kneel for Tyrion. This is one of the best, if not the best thing, that she does in the book. How hard would it be to show a fool - no need to even make it Dontos, just a random fool - for Tyrion to step on? Or have him bring back the stool or anything. Nooooo, Sansa had to kneel? Why the hell?
I was disappointed in Tyrion's "taking the black" line too - I admit it was really funny, but cannot understand why it is any better than what he said in the book.
I would have wished for some dancing at the wedding, but then I just adore dancing scenes.

3924	Ser Loudmouth	2013-05-20	This episode had two scenes that I was looking forward to from book 3, both involving Stannis. One is his dialogue with Davos about the value of one child's life against the realm, and the other is the 3 leeches scene. Well, I'm glad the scenes are in but "they changed it and it sucks". The conversation with Davos was still a powerfull scene, but not as good as the books, and the change was unnecessary. As for the leeches scene, there was not much to change. It's just that I had allways envisioned that scene as an episode cliffhanger, and I'm disappointed that it wasn't done like that (yes, that's a nitpick, but this is the nitpick thread after all). Much worse was the leadup to that moment. The show had many gratuitous sex scenes so far, but this one was among the top offenders.

3928	PatrickStormborn	2013-05-20	That doesn't sound like a feminist; it sounds like someone (like me) who feels the booty quota is too high.Well, for me personally, the nudity feels very exploitative. Even when the nudity appears empowering (Dany rising from the bath), I can't help but remember the interview about the "pervert" producer and feel really creeped out. If they want to add nudity, they should make it equal. Seeing a naked woman and a clothed man is getting really tiring.They will never have gratuitous male nude scenes.

3932	Buckwheat	2013-05-20	she kneels in the book.I suggest you read the chapter again. She does not kneel, she stands strong and they need to call Dontos and Tyrion stands on his back to be able to put the cloak to her shoulders.

3936	bobbybuilderton	2013-05-20	So Robb is actually popular? Interesting... Guess there's still hope for a twitterplosion!Ehh from what I can gather it was a very informal, unstructured process. They didn't actually survey people. It's more their interpretation of a very small number of tweets. 200k is not small as far as size goes, but it's a small sample group relative to the size of the audience.But I was asked for something other than my own wild claim about viewer gender, so I offered it.

3939	teemo	2013-05-20	In general, hit HBO shows are more equal in male and female viewers than you may think.  Even shows you would really think are really heavily male are usually quite close.According to this site the audience is 45% female.  I'm not shocked by that number.  Follows the trend of your average HBO show.http://www.nypost.co...30KagLzk4gfDbWI

3944	nara	2013-05-20	Ok so in this episode they have finally stated Show!Sansa's age. And.. it doesn't make any sense. Sophie Turner isn't fourteen and she doesn't look fourteen. She looks more like twenty.I always thought Show!Sansa was Joffrey's age which is stated to be 17 ( maybe 18 now ).In the books, Sansa is 11 in AGOT and in the show, she was 13 in season 1.  The actress always looked older than that (even though she was only 14 in season 1), but they couldn<U+0080><U+0099>t age the character too much because then it would be strange that she had not yet flowered, which is an important part of her story.  Since the actress is very tall and matured early, it does create a dilemma for the show.  It made sense for 12 year old Sansa to be so frightened and trembling at the thought of the bedding and having sex with anyone, let alone Tyrion.  It would be less believable from an actress who looks like a woman grown.Knowing Dany they probably tried to guard her but she ignored their advice and did what she wanted LOLOne of the things I really miss in the TV show is the sense of young, unprepared boys and girls thrust into leadership roles and unsure of the decisions they make.  Dany and Robb seem to be confident to the point of overbearing and I didn<U+0080><U+0099>t get that feeling in the books.My other nitpicks:Total waste of Cersei in this episode.  Would have preferred to see her torture Tyrion or play fake mom to Sansa.  I thought the introduction of the Rains of Castamere was forced dialog.  It would have made more sense to have Robb explain that to foreigner Talisa  than for Cersei to tell the story to Margaery, who grew up in Westeros and would already know the story, and then threaten her openly.  Plus, that would have been an actual good use of Talisa, rather than having her steal Catelyn<U+0080><U+0099>s role.Also, I didn<U+0080><U+0099>t like the change to the Rains of Castamere story to be when Cersei and Jaime were alive.  IIRC, Tywin was 18 or 19 at the time and the episode got him noticed by King Aerys, who then named him Hand.  I always thought that Tywin<U+0080><U+0099>s young age made the story particularly horrifying.
3945	Spidey	2013-05-20	My nitpick is something that's been bugging me since season one and was brought to the forefront again this week. They keep taking away the Hounds most memorable quotes. There was no rant about knights when he was a captive of the BwB, there was no "Do you know what dogs do to wolves?" last week and there was no "your uncle's bloody wedding" this episode.
What is so hard about keeping those lines in???

Plus, that would have been an actual good use of Talisa, rather than having her steal Catelyn&rsquo;s role.I like the story but yes Cersei was not subtle at all, which I didn't like. But why the heck would Robb bother telling the Rains of Castamere story? I mean I get Talisa doesn't know much about Westeros, but why would he bother? It's a House Lannister story, and I doubt anything would come about where he would need to explain what it means. I agree though that something that would make her of actual use would be nice though instead of just stealing Cat's scenes and the cheesy non chemistry kissing between the two.
3949	Frey Pie a la Mode	2013-05-20	Cersei claims that Tywin hung the bodies of the Reynes "to rot all summer. And it was a long summer"?? How long? Like a decade? Since that would be a long summer in the world of ASOIAF. 
There's been so little reference to the alternate seasons in the story, which kills much of the impact of what's going on. "Winter is Coming" means a lot more when that winter may last over a decade, as some fear this one will. There's a scene in the show at Harrenhall with Tywin and his council, talking about how some of the Stark bannermen may desert Robb to tend their harvests. Tywin retorts that their own lords may do the same, which is much more understandable in the context of preparing for years of deprivation. Going hungry for a few months because the war interrupted your harvest is very different from everyone starving because of it.
Do non-book readers even remember that the seasons are so long in the story? There's been so little reminder for them to do so!

Oh well, I'm predicting right now that the RW episode, with its fabulous invisible build it up, and scheduling hiatus is going to be one of the lowest rated episodes of the season.
3952	Lady Zima	2013-05-20	i dont get why people are so mad about sansa kneelingshe just stood there like an idiot waiting for tyrion to cloak her for a short while before eventually kneeling, that alone is insult enough. any more would have made her character a complete b-word next to cersei, which is not what the show runners are aiming for atleast i dont think.I just thought it made her look stupid, what did she expect at first? tyrion to fly and cloak her? the fact that she needed tyrion to remind her that hes a dwarf just made her look like a dumbass. and many people already think she is one. lol. sansa. what a joke.THIS! In the book, we are privy to her inner dialogue so we are aware of what is going on in her head during this scene. Here in the show, she would have just looked like a dumb biotch. (more than she already did with having to be coaxed into kneeling in the first place).
3953	Gryz the BlackSmith	2013-05-20	Biggest deal of the episode: Stannis telling us that he saw a vision in the flames. A great battle in the snow. He's going to the wall. One of the major turning points in the storyline of the five books.
In the show, it is presented via one short sentence. And the focus of the sentence was on something else. ("Isn't R'hllor great ?").
I doubt anyone noticed.
I expect people to be really surprised when Stannis moves north.
3954	Ran	2013-05-20	No she wouldn't have, as her set expression would have made it plain that she was angry and defiant. Way too many people seem to think that acting does not involve acting, that it's all just reading off lines or something. Actors use body language, facial expressions, and so on to provide further shades of meaning to everything their character does.
3955	nara	2013-05-20	I like the story but yes Cersei was not subtle at all, which I didn't like. But why the heck would Robb bother telling the Rains of Castamere story? I mean I get Talisa doesn't know much about Westeros, but why would he bother? It's a House Lannister story, and I doubt anything would come about where he would need to explain what it means. I agree though that something that would make her of actual use would be nice though instead of just stealing Cat's scenes and the cheesy non chemistry kissing between the two.  Robb could have used it to explain what will happen to all his allies if they lose the war--entire families wiped out--and why it's important to keep fighting.  Another option would have been for Jaime to tell Brienne the story and explain how the incident led to Tywin being picked as Hand--and then go on to tell the story of how Tywin and Aerys then became estranged.  I just use these as examples of how the story could have been told in a more natural way than what we had in this episode.
3956	The GreatRon	2013-05-20	Are they going to sew Talisa's head onto Robbs body instead since it seems Grey Wind doesn't exist anymore?  
Are there going to be any other Northmen at the wedding, or is this just going to be just about two people instead of figureheads from almost every northern house?
I feel like they hallowed Robb and Cats story out so much that the HBO RW can't possibly deliver the same way the first time you read ASoS, and that's a shame for people who havn't read it.
3957	Winter In My Heart	2013-05-20	Robb could have used it to explain what will happen to all his allies if they lose the war--entire families wiped out--and why it's important to keep fighting.  Another option would have been for Jaime to tell Brienne the story and explain how the incident led to Tywin being picked as Hand--and then go on to tell the story of how Tywin and Aerys then became estranged.  I just use these as examples of how the story could have been told in a more natural way than what we had in this episode.Aah okay I see. So you mean like last season when she kept back talking and questioning him. (At least that would have been a good time to tell her the story IMO) or Jaime and Brienne would have been a good choice.Are they going to sew Talisa's head onto Robbs body instead since it seems Grey Wind doesn't exist anymore?  I don't know how much I'd want to continue watching the show if they did that. Ew. I'd almost say that's worse than doing so using Grey Wind lol. But they have shown him a couple times this season, just nowhere near as much as they should. All the direwolves really.. They get like two second shots that you miss if you aren't paying really close attention. It's sad really.. The RW definitely won't have as big of an impact as it could have if they would have done a good build up.
3958	Frey Filet	2013-05-20	Daario Naharis in the books- cocky, swashbuckling rogue with no reservations.  DH in the series- poetic, reserved casanova who bears no physical resemblance to his literary self.

3959	ohpooratlas	2013-05-20	We have to wait two weeks for episode 9.
That was my biggest nitpick.
Little things:
I feel like Sansa's discomfort/misery with the situation was downplayed in favor of showing Tyrion's.  I don't think they had to change anything they did with Tyrion but something felt missing with Sansa.  The only time I ever really felt her horror was when Joffery was talking her (wonderfully acted and disturbing scene.)
It was jarring for me when she said she was fourteen.  Dany said only a year had passed earlier in the episode which just felt ... strange to me.  I feel like more time has passed than that.
3960	The Unholy Reaver	2013-05-20	still no greyjoy.
3961	Raksha the Demon	2013-05-20	In the books, Sansa is 11 in AGOT and in the show, she was 13 in season 1.  The actress always looked older than that (even though she was only 14 in season 1), but they couldn<U+0080><U+0099>t age the character too much because then it would be strange that she had not yet flowered, which is an important part of her story.  Since the actress is very tall and matured early, it does create a dilemma for the show.  It made sense for 12 year old Sansa to be so frightened and trembling at the thought of the bedding and having sex with anyone, let alone Tyrion.  It would be less believable from an actress who looks like a woman grown.One of the things I really miss in the TV show is the sense of young, unprepared boys and girls thrust into leadership roles and unsure of the decisions they make.  Dany and Robb seem to be confident to the point of overbearing and I didn<U+0080><U+0099>t get that feeling in the books.My other nitpicks:Total waste of Cersei in this episode.  Would have preferred to see her torture Tyrion or play fake mom to Sansa.  I thought the introduction of the Rains of Castamere was forced dialog.  It would have made more sense to have Robb explain that to foreigner Talisa  than for Cersei to tell the story to Margaery, who grew up in Westeros and would already know the story, and then threaten her openly.  Plus, that would have been an actual good use of Talisa, rather than having her steal Catelyn<U+0080><U+0099>s role.Also, I didn<U+0080><U+0099>t like the change to the Rains of Castamere story to be when Cersei and Jaime were alive.  IIRC, Tywin was 18 or 19 at the time and the episode got him noticed by King Aerys, who then named him Hand.  I always thought that Tywin<U+0080><U+0099>s young age made the story particularly horrifying.I'm not sure if the series producers could have predicted, when they chose young Sophie Turner to play Sansa, that she would look so much mature than the girl she is playing.  Arya can still pass reasonably for at least 12-13 if you don't look too closely; but Sophie is so tall and wide-shouldered and developed that it strains credibility, when she's dressed up in court fashions, to believe that she's 14. It is annoying that mature, adult Robb (forget how old he's supposed to be, but he looks 25) acted like a horny teenager last season.  Much more believable of the 16-year-old "Young Wolf" in the books.I was afraid that the characterization of Sansa would be even worse this time; so I'm glad that her uneasiness, unhappiness and awkwardness in this forced marriage was allowed to come through; at least to a certain extent.  I remember her picking at her food and her hands being jittery; and then, after Tyrion mentioned that his father had commanded him to consummate the marriage, Sansa turning and joylessly removing her gown and starting on her shift; that all worked for me (would have loved to see TV-Sansa refuse to kneel instead of being confused).  What annoyed me the most about the episode was the waste of time that was Melisandre seducing Gendry for blood-of-kings-shadowbaby-making-sex and then kinky leech sucking on half-naked Gendry.  Ewww.  They could have devoted more time to the wedding, or Daenerys and Fabio Daario, or Sam & Gilly.  I suppose I should be glad that we didn't have another Theon Torture Session.
3962	Prince of the North	2013-05-20	My nitpick is something that's been bugging me since season one and was brought to the forefront again this week. They keep taking away the Hounds most memorable quotes. There was no rant about knights when he was a captive of the BwB, there was no "Do you know what dogs do to wolves?" last week and there was no "your uncle's bloody wedding" this episode.What is so hard about keeping those lines in???I agree with this X 1,000!  The Hound has some of the best dialogue in the series.  I want to hear Rory McCann deliver it!
3963	Raksha the Demon	2013-05-20	I agree with this X 1,000!  The Hound has some of the best dialogue in the series.  I want to hear Rory McCann deliver it!The TV-Hound is the Stark sisters' grumpy uncle; not the books' killing machine who has a crush on Sansa and tries to keep Arya safe even if he knocks her out and ties her up a few times...
3964	Prince of the North	2013-05-20	The TV-Hound is the Stark sisters' grumpy uncle; not the books' killing machine who has a crush on Sansa and tries to keep Arya safe even if he knocks her out and ties her up a few times...Yeah, I know.  That speech the Hound gives to the BWB where he basically calls all of them (and "knights" in general) out as hypocrites is some of the best dialogue ever and I think it's integral to what Martin is trying to convey to readers of ASoIaF.  It's a bit of a travesty that it was omitted.
3965	Pinkie Baelish	2013-05-20	I didn't notice this until people pointed it out, by WHY OH WHY DIDN'T THE DRAGONGLASS DISINTEGRATE WHEN IT STRUCK THE WHITE WALKER? Sam looks like the biggest idiot for leaving the blade there.
3966	MarieAntoinette	2013-05-21	For the moment, that scene was just awkward. By the time we reach Feast for Crows material, its going to change the whole dynamic of the Margaery-Cersei rivalry. No longer a prolonged battle of hidden schemes and public passive-aggressiveness, D&D seem to be prepping them to be open enemies.It was over the top for this episode and hardly subtle, but I think that it was foreshadowing the real Cersei. Since we don't get to hear Cersei's thoughts like in her POV chapters and because every character has limited screentime I think it is easier to show openly that she is indeed quite mad. They will probably focus more on the rivalry on the show compared to books since Margaery is a more fleshed out on the show.
3967	Master Forel's Fro	2013-05-21	My nitpick is about the little things they don't need to change and yet they do, it has no great effect on the greater story but still, like Gilly saying she doesn't know boy names, they could have had a Lil wildling history by saying why wildling don't name their babies till they are 3 years old would have shown the effects of living in such a harsh environment on the people and why its many of the reasons they want to get south, people are not meant to live notw. Just my Lil nitpicking.

3968	Underzaker	2013-05-21	Seriously , how could have daario slipped in her tent with two heads?
Doesn't Dany have guards , Jorah , Selmy and 3 freakin dragons to protect her?
3969	Master Forel's Fro	2013-05-21	Seriously , how could have daario slipped in her tent with two heads?Doesn't Dany have guards , Jorah , Selmy and 3 freakin dragons to protect her?And she's not even pissed he killed one of her unsullied.
3970	Ran	2013-05-21	Oh, yeah, I was going to remark on that one. Though... one need not assume the armor came from one of Dany's Unsullied. Someone in Yunkai may own a few, and the Second Sons requisitioned it from them.
3971	Master Forel's Fro	2013-05-21	^^ that's possible there were no holes in the armour, I wonder if it takes a long time to strangle an unsullied?
3972	King Tam Stark	2013-05-21	the mix of additional scenes added for tv and scenes cut from the books is making for the pace being too slow at times at the expense of more attractive scenes from the books being rushed cut out or done off camera
dany provided the wine for the second sons/storm crows too get too drunk to fight then they don't show the battle but in the same episode we are getting long drawn out boring scenes where the wedding and bedroom scene gets too much screen time and the most important bit is cut and sansa kneels, an extra 30 seconds was all that was needed to draw it out to its proper conclusion
the 3 second sons and the whore could easily have been replaced with a small battle scene where we see them getting too drunk then ambushed, most dissapointing episode of the series so far and the first one ive not been happy with
3973	Darth Zyroth	2013-05-21	Ok after some sleep I have more energy. So here are more nitpicks. I<U+0080><U+0099>m gonna guess some of them have already been mentioned, but I'll mention them anyways. Here I go.......This is going to be long.....- Famous lines!! I know this is an adaptation, and there are time and budget constraints, but keeping some dialogue the same doesn't cost anything!! Why are they changing or leaving out some of the character<U+0080><U+0099>s most famous lines???!!! The Hound's lines were given to LF or just omitted in season 1 and 2. JUST WHY??! Why didn't they keep "this cave is dark too, but I'm the terror here" and "your uncle's bloody wedding"??!! Or in the previous episode Jaime's line. Sure, "sorry for the sapphires" was good, but it'll never be even near as good as "Good, I only rescue maidens"!!! I'm expecting The Hound's little speech about knights in the upcoming episodes. If not, I'll be really really pissed and disappointed!!- Why do the Second Sons start speaking in the Common Tongue when they go into the tent? They are in Yunkai, not in Westeros. Why don<U+0080><U+0099>t they start speaking Valyrian, and then Dany asks them to speak in the common tongue? The same thing happened in the last episode. It really bothers me.- IIRC Grey Worm can<U+0080><U+0099>t speak the Common Tongue of Westeros. Every time he speaks, he speaks in Valyrian, and Dany replies to him in Valyrian as well. So, how the hell did he understand what Mero was saying and asked Dany if he should cut out his tongue??!!- Later when they are alone, the sellswords are speaking with each other in the Common Tongue of Westeros. Why not in Valyrian?? They live in Yunkai!!! And (I already said this, but I<U+0080><U+0099>ll say it again) neither Mero, nor Daario have a Braavosi and Tyroshi accent respectively.- Why isn<U+0080><U+0099>t there someone guarding Dany<U+0080><U+0099>s tent??!! How can it be so easy for someone to get in??!!!!- Daario is not enough arrogant, self-centered, and without reservations!!!!! He is too<U+0080>nice.- Cersei so openly threatening Margaery. She makes mistakes, and some stupid things, but she is NOT that stupid.- I didn<U+0080><U+0099>t like that they changed the story of the Rains of Castamere. Like that Cersei had already been born when the Reynes rebelled against Tywin (instead of Tytos). And she said Tywin hanged the corpses in Casterly Rock all summer. All summer??! So for like seven years???!! Makes no sense<U+0080><U+0080>- I<U+0080><U+0099>m soooooo over the Queen of Thornes. Enough already!! I cannot stand her, she's so annoying. I can<U+0080><U+0099>t wait for Margaery and Tommen to get married so she can go back to The Reach. Unless the producers love her so much that decide she<U+0080><U+0099>ll stay and help Margaery scheme against Cersei. Oh wait<U+0080><U+0080><U+0080>- I wanted a dancing scene during the wedding!!! No wedding is a wedding without dancing!!- Gilly doesn<U+0080><U+0099>t mention that the Wildlings only get a name when they are two years old!! I<U+0080><U+0099>ll be waiting for her to say it in the next episodes.- No Coldhands /crying.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':crying:' /> Although he can still appear, so we<U+0080><U+0099>ll see<U+0080><U+0080>- Puddles became Shards /crying.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':crying:' />- Sam doesn<U+0080><U+0099>t pick up the Obsidian dagger!!!- Why can<U+0080><U+0099>t Sam make a fire??!!! He was Aemon<U+0080><U+0099>s steward. He used to make fires all the time!!! He used to hunt with his father. He should, must, HAS to know how to make a fire!!!- Stannis doesn<U+0080><U+0099>t show any internal conflict when delivering his lines!!! He even has an arrogant smile, even when Davos is talking!!!- Davos doesn<U+0080><U+0099>t believe in any Gods???!!! Well, since in season 2 he doesn<U+0080><U+0099>t give a shit about the Seven burning, I guess it<U+0080><U+0099>s<U+0080>ok<U+0080><U+0080>.And where is his famous line: <U+0080><U+009C>Everything<U+0080><U+009D>??!!- The whole Melisandre/Gendry scene was just terrible! It makes no sense at all to me. Mel wants to burn Gendry according to the conversation between Davos and Stannis. But then Davos convinces Stannis of not doing it, so she decides not to do it. So instead she is going to leech him. But is the sex part necessary to leech him???! And does she have to tie him to leech him??! She can just ask him to put the leeches I<U+0080><U+0099>m sure it<U+0080><U+0099>s not a big deal!!!! And why does she have to penis-leech him??!! He has blood all over his body! But if the blood is stronger in his cock and has to be from there then, why not put the three down there??!!! Why only one???!! And if she is going to have sex with him then why not just make a shadow baby instead of leeching him???!!! And then ask Davos to take her to King<U+0080><U+0099>s Landing since is too easy (especially for her) to get very very near to the Red Keep!!!!!!! Just makes not fucking sense at all<U+0080><U+0080>..- I felt like the wedding was more centered in Tyrion<U+0080><U+0099>s misery than in Sansa<U+0080><U+0099>s!!!!!!!!- Tyrion<U+0080><U+0099>s line: <U+0080><U+009C>And so my watch begins<U+0080><U+009D>. That makes no freaking sense!!! The oath of the Night<U+0080><U+0099>s Watch is not only about chastity, it<U+0080><U+0099>s about taking no wife, holding no lands, fathering no children, wearing no crowns, and wining no glory. It<U+0080><U+0099>s about giving your life to the Realm!!! BUT he is married, so it doesn<U+0080><U+0099>t apply, and makes no sense!!!!!! Why not keep his <U+0080><U+009C>Never?<U+0080><U+009D> <U+0080><U+009C>Why, that is why the gods made whores for imps like me<U+0080><U+009D>. It shows some of his pain, and his vices.- No Robb and no Cat. The RW has had a terrible building up. Although not Robb and Cat may actually be a good thing. That way we don<U+0080><U+0099>t have to watch that complete disaster and mess of storyline, and I can say <U+0080><U+009C>I told you so!<U+0080><U+009D> to the people who last week told me <U+0080><U+009C>There are still two episodes left for setting up the RW. There will be more scenes in the next episode and half of the 9th just for that<U+0080><U+009D>. HA!I think that's it. I feel better now.

It seemed too thuggish, while in the books, it had a really ominous tone to it. I wish he conveyed more hatred of Balon, Robb and Joffrey in that scene.

The leech scene. The obviously long seduction that everyone knew was coming? Not a big deal.
What I do hate is that Stannis refers to Joffrey as Joffrey Baratheon. In the show and the books, he knows that Joffrey is NOT a Baratheon so why doesn't he just call him "the usurper Joffrey the bastard." ?

3985	Le Cygne	2013-05-21	Not letting Sansa have her moment of defiance.  But then again, she's been absent from her own story for most of the season.
The inside the episode video was quite revealing, Benioff and Weiss spent the whole time talking about how hard it was for Tyrion.
3986	Dragonmaster	2013-05-21	Arya just needed to say "Joffrey" though. And Joffrey the bastard would not mean a poor Flea Bottom boy, since Stannis says they're the usurpers.
3987	The God of Tits and Wine	2013-05-21	So show Davos doesn't believe in the gods? That's a bit of character assassination, isn't? He's probably one of the only POV characters in the series that actually has faith.I thought about that, too. Not that he's the only POV character with a faith (Ned was a firm believer in the Old Gods and Arya seems very confident in her belief in Him of Many Faces, even though she only knows him by the name of death), but it certainly is out of character for Davos to deny the Seven, seeing as the Mother even spoke to him.
3988	WiDMNDBAMMD	2013-05-21	- Davos doesn<U+0080><U+0099>t believe in any Gods???!!!

It<U+0080><U+0099>s about giving your life to the Realm!!!but we know that is not how Tyrion sees the Night's Watch even though he has a great admiration for what they do.Tyrion is now protecting a giant cold Northerner from her enemies and without getting her to love him he will hold no lands, father no children and wear no crowns and his marriage can be set aside.BUT he is married, so it doesn<U+0080><U+0099>t apply, and makes no sense!!!!!! Why not keep his <U+0080><U+009C>Never?<U+0080><U+009D> <U+0080><U+009C>Why, that is why the gods made whores for imps like me<U+0080><U+009D>. It shows some of his pain, and his vices.Tyrion cannot give her the whore line because he's being faithful to Shae who at this moment is pretty pissed that he's getting married to her so like he said it, he has two women who hate him and if he impregnates Sansa Stark a whole kingdom to loath him.Tyrion probably thinks that Shae is going to leave him and Sansa is not going to sleep with him.It's pretty obvious that Tyrion is going to visit his whores he even made a comment about "I'm the god of tits and wine I'm going to give myself a shrine to the next brothel I visit.BTWEpic rant post nice job..I'm assuming Stannis and Mel thought that the spell needed the person's birth name to work. Otherwise some poor street urchin in Flea Bottom called Joffrey might have died instead.He called him usurper, I'm pretty sure The Lord of Light could tell the difference between a street urchin and a usurper.also Arya gave Jaqen a name of "the tickler" and that name was enough.Guess the God of Death has more power than the Lord of Light.

3989	Cuthbert Allgood	2013-05-21	I used to be mad at Linda for being a book purist during Season 2. Now I'm a book purist.  It looks like they think their target audience is dumber than those of the books. I hate how they ruined the whole Cersei - Tyrell dance.
Cersei and Tyrells try to undermine each other starting from ASOS and never truly show their hands until the very end of AFFC. And when the shit finally hits the fan, -Margarey yells her "BITCH!"- it is a very satistifying pay off.  And in the show Cersei threatens to have her strangled while she sleeps, so soon. Yeah, right.
Also Sansa should have totally NOT KNEEL.

3991	Cas Stark	2013-05-21	I don't know about being a book purist, I went a lot easier on the show last season than many people over the changes.  But, changes for the sake of change or god forbid, for "surprising" the book fans is epically stupid, changes that don't make sense even within the show context are just bad writing.
I'm surprised there haven't been more complaints about no Robb and Cat, but maybe everyone is resigned and wants to get their botched storyline over with.
3992	Le Cygne	2013-05-21	Also, agree with the ages confusion.  I can't even begin to picture show Sansa as 14.  And it's not what they established in season 1, she was 13.  She should be 15 (and they could have gone older, hell, they're making everything else up, why not).  Book Sansa was just days away from 13 when she got married (book Dany got married at 13, but the show aged her up).
3993	David Selig	2013-05-21	Also, agree with the ages confusion.  I can't even begin to picture show Sansa as 14.  And it's not what they established in season 1, she was 13.

It really doesn't seem like it has been more than several months IMO (apart from the ageing of the actors).

Dismissing someone as a 'book purist' when they have a very legitimate complaint about how an existing storyline was altered from the books, to no apparent gain and much apparent harm, strikes me as lazy.

It's why so many people both hate and love characters like Theon/Reek, Jaime, Cersei, Tyrion, Dany, etc.	D&D (and myself as well) see Tyrion as more of a good/gray type character and they're portraying him as such.   Just because you see the character in a different way, doesn't mean D&D doesn't have a grasp or understanding of the character(s).   Heck, if you asked them, it's you that don't have a good understanding of the characters.

Completely changing the motivations and personality of a character, like Shae, is something different.

4002	The Knight of Flours	2013-05-21	In a series full of POV chapters (where narrators can be biased, misleading, unreliable narrators etc) surely all readers should understand that not everyone else's POV is going to be the same as yours in regards to different characters and their actions.
Both for the book AND the tv show.
4003	Versiroth	2013-05-21	Whitewashing a character is one thing, showing them doing something totally OUT of character...like Stannis begging Mel not to leave him on the beach like a love sick school boy...is something different.  Completely changing the motivations and personality of a character, like Shae, is something different.Again, perception is key.   I didn't see Stannis pleading with Mel like a love sick school boy.  I saw it more like a desperate man wanting to make another shadow son to smote those that have wronged the rightful king.   It was meant to show how low he's fallen after the blackwater.Also,  Shae isn't important enough to care about.   She is a Tyrion plot device only.   The only difference so far is that she seems to care for Tyrion, were as in the books, she seemed to only care about the life style he provided.   It's very likely that D&D wants her betrayal to hit harder.   In order to do that, they have to make their relationship more that it was in the books.  In the books, it was obvious that she was only with him for the money, so the betrayal wasn't shocking at all.  For the show, they're going to add drama any place they can.
4004	Cas Stark	2013-05-21	She gets a lot of screen time for a "plot device"...hasn't she had more screen time than Cately Stark this season?
I'll be surprised if Tyrion kills Shae in the show because they have made her so nice, it would be a much worse crime of killing TV Shae than it ever was killing Book Shae, and is not consistent with their overall portrayal of Tyrion as a super nice guy.
4005	Versiroth	2013-05-21	She gets a lot of screen time for a "plot device"...hasn't she had more screen time than Cately Stark this season?I'll be surprised if Tyrion kills Shae in the show because they have made her so nice, it would be a much worse crime of killing TV Shae than it ever was killing Book Shae, and is not consistent with their overall portrayal of Tyrion as a super nice guy.Shae will testify against Tyrion at his trail, he will find her in Tywins bed and he will kill her (with the golden chain that he just gave her a couple episodes ago).   So yes.  She is a Tyrion plot device.  Also, Tyrion is a super nice guy at this point in the story in the books as well (I'd argue that he's always a good/gray character through our all 5).  Other than having Bronn kill the singer, what other evilish things had he done in the books that they've left out?   Honestly, the fact that Tyrion seemed to be the only Lannister with a conscience is what made him stand out as a character in the books.

So, again, to me, it shows a strange reading of the characters and their movitations, Book Tyrion kills her for this reason....because he realizes she NEVER cared about him.  It's not going to be believable that TV Shae never cared about him, so he's going to kill some poor whore that he brought to KL, that has been trying to get him to leave Westeros, because after he--her only protector--is thrown in jail, she testifies against him?  How is that sympathetic for TV Tyrion?
4007	Darth Zyroth	2013-05-21	In season 2 he tells his son that Stannis Baratheon is his god.Oh, right. Forgot about that..... I couldn't complain back then since I wasn't around the forum, so I'm complaining now. But I did say that it's..ok.....with Show!Davos. I still don't like it, though.but we know that is not how Tyrion sees the Night's Watch even though he has a great admiration for what they do.Admiration? yeah. Like when he pissed off from the Wall; or when he told Jon that the NW was full of thieves, liars, and rapists; or when he promised Mormont and Aemon that he'd tell the King and Queen to help the NW, but he never did; or when he left Ser Alliser rotting in a cell with the rotting hand, and never saw him, and we never saw Alliser again in the show.Tyrion is now protecting a giant cold Northerner from her enemies and without getting her to love him he will hold no lands, father no children and wear no crowns and his marriage can be set aside.Protecting? I seem to recall that he told her that she would be in a different kind of prison now that she was his wife (unless that's his definition of "protecting").... He could get Winterfell, the title of Lord of Winterfell, and Warden of the North.....Tyrion cannot give her the whore line because he's being faithful to Shae who at this moment is pretty pissed that he's getting married to her so like he said it, he has two women who hate him and if he impregnates Sansa Stark a whole kingdom to loath him.Oh, right they're supposed to be "in love". But wouldn't the phrase make Shae happy? Because that'd mean that he wouldn't cheat on her with Sansa and wouldn't abuse a girl. Wouldn't the NW line mean that he won't have sex with anyone, not even with Shae? So he would dump Shae to remain faithful to Sansa and keep his "vow"? Not a whole kingdom I think you can substract the Karstarks and Boltons.Tyrion probably thinks that Shae is going to leave him and Sansa is not going to sleep with him.I'll agree here.It's pretty obvious that Tyrion is going to visit his whores he even made a comment about "I'm the god of tits and wine I'm going to give myself a shrine to the next brothel I visit.I do hope so.Or are you joking with me? hehe /drunk.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':drunk:' />BTWEpic rant post nice job.Thank you! /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />You should've seen last week's.....

How is that sympathetic for TV Tyrion?Like it or not, Shae testifying against him, Tyrion finding her in Tywins bed and then him killing her and Tywin are all three going to be used to shock the TV audience.   Especially because they believe Tyrion would never do such a thing.  It kind of marks a point of no return for the character (in the books and the TV show).   Without this scene, people would believe it a possibility that Tyrion could clear his name of the Joffrey murder and then return to Kings landing.  Thanks to Tywin's death, that is an impossibility regardless.
4009	The Pain Yak	2013-05-21	Other than having Bronn kill the singer, what other evilish things had he done in the books that they've left out?He raped Tysha. He threatens to beat and rape his nephew in order to cow Cersei. He arms clansmen who rape, loot and murder their way across the Vale and are apparently nearly as bad in King's Landing. He orders that a man being sent to the Night's Watch be thrown overboard on the way there. He sends men under a truce banner who then proceed to break it so they can free Jaime. He sends his own men out into a naval battle without informing them that they're only there as bait for the giant wildfire trap he's laid. He allows Joffrey to nail antlers to men's heads and lob them at Stannis. He isn't  anywhere near as disturbed by the prospect of the Sansa marriage and in fact sees it as a way to escape Joffrey's grasp when he comes of age. And so on. A lot of those are perfectly understandable. All of them still shift him towards being a grey character rather than a hero.
4010	Darth Zyroth	2013-05-21	Also, Show!Tyrion never said that when he was a kid he would imagine his father and sister burning and never broke Marillion's fingers, and never slapped Shae.

Seen from the outside, Tyrion can be considered just as capable of being a ruthless bastard as any other Lannister; he just has to be pushed a little farther. That's what makes him interesting. He isn't Ned Stark with a brain and a functioning survival instinct. Deep down, he is a Lannister and perfectly capable of following in his father's footsteps when he needs to do so.

4021	Darth Zyroth	2013-05-21	So, I guess you don't really get what "good/gray" means, huh?I agree that Tyrion is a "good guy" (at least to me) but he does do many "bad things", and many are not only to "bad" people. He is a grey character. That's exactly why he's one of my favorite characters, because he has a "dark side", and is not a true "Hero". However, I really dislike Show!Tyrion (except for Peter Dinklage). He is being portrayed as a Prince Charming, shining armor knight, misunderstood hero, and Ned 2.0 but in the size of a dwarf. They've taken a lot of his fascinating complexity out of him, and I HATE that. He's NOT a grey character, he is pretty much WHITE!

I just think he's a man who in the very least tries to do the right thing most of the time.   That doesn't at all mean that he isn't capable of doing horrendous things when he's pushed to do so, but he's definitely more good/gray than simply gray in my mind.   Because of that, I don't mind that he's portrayed as more of a good guy on the show.

He is SUCH  complex character in the novels. Is he in the show?

4025	Versiroth	2013-05-21	With the scenes he's had this season, how could they have made him grayer?    Also, with as little time as they have on this show to dedicate to each plot line, it's a little harder to get every aspect of each character out (especially with no exposition).   The one aspect of Tyrion that separates him as a Lannister in the books was the fact that he wasn't inherently ruthless for the sake of being so.   So, personally, I'm glad that in the very least, that part is shown.
4026	bobbybuilderton	2013-05-21	I'm surprised no one is yelling about Mero's line being foreshadowing for later books.
"You'll die young"

4028	WardenOfTheNerds	2013-05-21	Much like every episode has something drastic being done to someone's penis, every nitpick thread has an argument about Tyrion.
4029	PatrickStormborn	2013-05-21	Honestly, the fact that Tyrion seemed to be the only Lannister with a conscience is what made him stand out as a character in the books. Are we reading different books? In ADwD Tyrion raped a sex slave (twice). He's certainly a darker shade of grey than Jaime (and Jaime is still very dark!)I don't consider Tyrion a good person. I consider him a neutral person who does good and bad things.But my view on him is irrelevant, as is D&D's. They should be portraying Tyrion accurately as he was in the book by showing his actions, without letting their biased view alter his portrayal. But honestly, they can hardly be called Tyrion fans; whitewashing him is just doing a major disservice to his character.With the scenes he's had this season, how could they have made him grayer?	Also, with as little time as they have on this show to dedicate to each plot line, it's a little harder to get every aspect of each character out (especially with no exposition).   The one aspect of Tyrion that separates him as a Lannister in the books was the fact that he wasn't inherently ruthless for the sake of being so.   So, personally, I'm glad that in the very least, that part is shown. Sigh, do you not understand characterisation? The show has been whitewashing Tyrion from the start and that has had a major butterfly effect this season. But even if they only had a "little time"* to show his grey actions, they still shouldn't be whitewashing his behaviour. Book!Tyrion did not inform Sansa of the wedding; book!Tyrion was pleased at the thought of marrying Sansa; book!Tyrion did not walk Sansa to her wedding; book!Tyrion slapped Shae when she spoke back to him; book!Tyrion did not politely ask Sansa to kneel - he just ignorantly tugged at her dress; etc.All these little things - all Tyrion's mannerisms and the language he uses - have led to the audience generally viewing him as a genuinely good person, Ned 2.0. It's an insult to one of the most complex characters in the entire series.* I call bullshit on the "little time" seeing as they managed to find time for Pod's magic dick and gratuitous torture and nudity, but whatever.
4030	'96Buck	2013-05-21	Are we reading different books? In ADwD Tyrion raped a sex slave (twice). He's certainly a darker shade of grey than Jaime (and Jaime is still very dark!)It is logically impossible to rape a sex slave.  A sex slave does not have standing to withhold consent.  By definition, then, the sex is consentual.  That's what being a slave is, and why slavery is bad.
4031	PatrickStormborn	2013-05-21	It is logically impossible to rape a sex slave.  A sex slave does not have standing to withhold consent.  By definition, then, the sex is consentual.  That's what being a slave is, and why slavery is bad. Slaves do not consent. Therefore any sex with a slave lacks consent and is rape.It's embarassing that I have to educate you about something so straightforward.
4032	WardenOfTheNerds	2013-05-21	Tyrion explicitly said on the show "I am not Ned Stark", so stop whining he is Ned 2.0.
Now seriously, on topic:
Anyone else thinks that the dialogue between the 3 sellswords is pretty bad? I mean everything about it bugs me - Daario who needs to point out his philosophy of life in every sentence, the way they go from talking about Mero's cock to a plan how to defeat Daenerys in like 2 minutes, how the only contribution of Pendahl was saying "OH NO SHE HAS 8k UNSULLIED" (seriously why cast the guy...?). It's not really realistic for mercenary companies to survive if they make crucial decisions sitting outside for everyone to hear and letting a whore randomly choose a guy for the mission.
4033	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-21	It is logically impossible to rape a sex slave.  A sex slave does not have standing to withhold consent.  By definition, then, the sex is consentual.  That's what being a slave is, and why slavery is bad.Can you not please. That is absolutely disgusting. Of course you can rape a sex slave, just because she's a slave means she can't say no, the the absence of the ''no'' does not mean consent. Tyrion rapes her.
4034	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-21	He rapes her, vomits all over her and rapes her again. 
Yeah, top bloke.
4035	Roose Seal	2013-05-21	He rapes her, vomits all over her and rapes her again.Yeah, top bloke.But he's a good guy! She couldn't legally say no, so it isn't rape! /rolleyes.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':rolleyes:' />I'm so over this show. It's basically "The Tudors, WITH MAGIC" now. Guilty pleasure more than anything at this point. When people who haven't seen it ask me what it's like I usually say "hmmm, fantasy soap-opera?".Even without comparing it to the books it's so far removed from the compelling character drama it was in s1.At this point I'm just going to ignore Tyrion. From dark anti-hero to pure Ned Stark-level tragic hero. I realize he is the audience/producers' golden boy, but damn, are they trying hard to make him sympathetic.His one menacing line at Joffrey was incredibly well done though. That's about it.The entire bedding scene was poorly done. Shot/scripted in a way that made Tyrion come off as a great dude. Ugh.Gendry/Mel was stupid and unnecessary. A freebie for the "perv audience" I guess. At least show us Gendry's cock or something? Oh and did they borrow LF's teleporting device?No Robb/Cat in the episode leading up to the RW is idiotic. They're all going to die and everyone is going to be like "uhm why should we care?"Joffrey's shtick was fun originally but it's growing tiresome. He's a giddy little sociopath, we get it. Yawn.The Second Sons were a little obnoxious. True to the books, I guess but ugh, I just wanted to punch Daario in his (non-golden) teethCersei telling the story of the Reynes of Castamere was ominous alright, but her threat at the end was so stupid. Surely Margaery is clever enough to understand that her telling the story is a threat of its own? But is the audience? Apparently not.Olenna is comic relief. Yawn.Sam the Slayer was the only good thing about this episode.

Note that I'm not saying I prefer slavery, or that we should have slavery, or that slavery is or has ever been a positive aspect of society.  However, in those cultures portrayed in the show/books in which they have slavery, the slaves are in fact slaves.  The moral/ethical choices of the characters should be considered within the context the characters are using to make them, not modern day standards or any particular aspirational standards.  Interesting to consider, perhaps, the perceived line in the Ironborn culture between their thralls and the Ghiscari view of true slaves captured and sold.

4039	Maizel	2013-05-21	Did Cersei ever so blatantly threaten members of arguably the more powerful half of their alliance in the book?
It's a good starting point for her self made downfall,  but I didn;t think it was all that smart.

No.If anyone in Westeros found out what Tyrion did to that sex slave, they would be horrified. Because guess what? Slavery is illegal in Westeros!!! By your own admission, Tyrion's actions are vile.But anyway, sex without fully informed consent is rape, regardless of when the action was committed. Stop trying to justify it.
4042	protar	2013-05-21	Tyrion explicitly said on the show "I am not Ned Stark", so stop whining he is Ned 2.0.Which is another problem. They've whitewashed Tyrion so much, but still think they can play the edgy morally ambiguous card and have it make sense. Tyrion "isn't Ned Stark", his head is "filled with evil notions" ect. ect. They still treat him like the anti-hero he is in the books when he isn't.

He's basically a Good Guy<U+0099>, but he's still just grey enough to not have Ned Stark levels of stupidity.
4044	Talbot	2013-05-21	To be fair, this stuff doesnt happen until ADWD, and the show is like halfway through ASOS. So there's time.

But we shall see!

He's still a main character, and will get enough screentime between now and ADWD to "darken".This is one of the problems with being book readers, a lot of us (mostly this thread) compare current characters to their ADWD counterparts, when their arcs haven't reached that point yet. The show has a lot of time to expand and "black-wash" Tyrion. D&D/Cogman are good writers, despite the negativity in this thread. They'll get him to that point.The only thing I'll say is that even if/when D&D start to write Tyrion's downward spiral, a good majority of fans are still going to revere him as a character.
4048	protar	2013-05-21	To be fair, this stuff doesnt happen until ADWD, and the show is like halfway through ASOS. So there's time. Where was him murdering the singer then, which also would have provided a decent vehicle for his relationship with Shae? Where was his withholding information from Sansa regarding their impending wedding(coming from someone who was very sympathetic to both parties.)?Tyrion has most certainly been whitewashed and it's made him a lot less interesting. And when we get to the end of season 4 it's a choice between a) diverging completely from the books and not have Tyrion kill Shae or do anything horrible in Essos or b.) have Tyrion do a completely jarring 180 in terms of morality which will turn off audiences. They dug themselves into a bit of a corner.

However, RW is supposed to be the Baelor/Blackwater of this season, right? How can it have nearly as much impact when it hasn't had half the build-up?

But to say that over the next 11 episodes they can't start to turn Tyrion a little darker is absurd. Look at what they did with Jaime this season.i think they will be 100% faithful in terms of Shae/Tywin/Tyrion, but I disagree that it'll turn off audiences. I think the non-book reading crowd will still adore him. They can have the murder of the singer next season if they want, it's not like it's a huge climactic event. That's something that can be moved around and orchestrated for different reasons.

I've made no statement regarding Tyrion, but slavery itself is vile in the modern context, an atrocious abuse of man's Natural Rights, so I don't know what "admission" you believe I've made.Why do you appeal to Westerosi society in one sentence, then wipe that away in the next with "anyway?"  No, not "anyway."  Define and defend your "way."  And I certainly have no need to "justify" a fictional event, especially one written by someone else.  That doesn't even make sense.I enourage you to engage in discussion without commentary with respect to the discussor.

They can write his arc next season as losing his cool and going berzerk over being imprisoned falsely. Killing Tywin is a complete 180? Maybe from a physical standpoint, but do you really think Tyrion, deep down, doesn't want to get payback against his father? As for Shae, yea its shocking, but its also shocking in the books. The fact is, you're supposed to sympathize with him during the trial. He is falsely accused for a monstrous crime, his "lover" embarrasses and betrays him at the trial in front of the WHOLE court, he loses his trial by combat due to an over-zealous champion, he finally sees Jaime again when he's released, only to learn that Tysha wasn't a whore. Then he finds his whore lover in bed with his hypocritical father.It's a huge amount of pent up frustration and anger that causes Tyrion to murder his father and lover, not because he's a dark character.

But in the show he's been portrayed with barely any moral ambiguity aside from some token greyness he gets for being a Lannister and for being a bit of a womaniser (which we barely get to see.). And now in season 4 they're throwing him into a situation where all his support is gone and everyone is against him. He'll be at his most sympathetic yet.Killing Tywin people will be able to buy I'd say. But killing Shae is just going to jar so much in a way it didn't in the books. I thought that they'd use his wedding to Sansa as a catalyst for their falling out, but after this episode she really just seemed a tad disgruntled, and from her expression seemed to have forgiven Tyrion after the revelation that he hadn't slept with Sansa.
4060	Woel	2013-05-21	But he wasn't in Westeros, so Westerosi law is not applicable.  And I did not take a position on whether or not what he did was "right" or "wrong."  So whatever realization Tyrion may have had is not germane.I've read your posts in this thread, and I find suprising that you are somehow making this into a discussion about the legal status of rape in different cultures of ASoIaF. In Westeros, a husband is (presumably) legally allowed to rape his wife, and raping a prostitute will (presumably) not lead to any repercussions. Raping a sex slave in Volon Therys or wherever Tyrion was is also perfectly legal. I personally don't find it interesting to have a discussion based on some absurd cultural relativism, where the value of consent to a sexual act depends on where it happens and who the victim is. If someone does not give consent to have sex, then it is rape.
4061	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-21	Talisa: No, don<U+0080><U+0099>t, don<U+0080><U+0099>t cut my hair, Robb loves my hair.Just you wait hahaTalisa: no...not my ass...robb loves my ass....

That's the point of having every support taken away from him. About Shae, they can re-work the writing a bit to build up to her death next season. Sure,I admit it's going to be a bit rushed and as you said, possibly jarring. But it's not going to be absurd or ridiculous. Tyrion will be in a massive fit of rage when he gets to Tywin's chamber, and seeing Shae there will probably be enough. But that's just my opinion. I trust D&D to handle the situation as best as possible, but apparently that's not a popular opinion here.
4063	Master Forel's Fro	2013-05-21	GOD PLEASE NO!!!!!! I swear I'm going to kill someone break something if that happens!!!!

4064	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-21	Yes it will be all about the tragic young, expecting couple, cat has been background to them it won't change in the end.seriously tho if it happens i will be so fucking pissed at the show.
4065	'96Buck	2013-05-21	It's a huge amount of pent up frustration and anger that causes Tyrion to murder his father and lover, not because he's a dark character.Killing your father (or anyone, for that matter) is pretty dark, but it's not hard to see how Tyrion sees it as justified.  And Tywin has been QUITE clear how much he despises Tyrion.  Even if given the chance, I can't imagine Tywin appealing to a bond of love between the two.
4066	Mulled Wino	2013-05-21	I"d like to nitpick that there aren't any new threads being approved for this week.  its been the same 20 for two days.  every other episode week has over 40
4067	Master Forel's Fro	2013-05-21	seriously tho if it happens i will be so fucking pissed at the show.Honestly tho would you be surprised? I wouldn't that's why I'm afraid it will happen.
4068	David Selig	2013-05-21	Yes it will be all about the tragic young, expecting couple, cat has been background to them it won't change in the end.it wouldn't surprise me given how much Cat has been ignored this season.According to this post, which seems accurate, Cat is 40th in the list of characters ranked by the number of lines they've had this season. 40th. The likes of Shae and Gendry are way in front of her.

4069	Young Nan	2013-05-21	I'm surprised no one is yelling about Mero's line being foreshadowing for later books."You'll die young"OH MY GOD FORESHADOWING FOR FUTURE BOOKS NOW WE KNOW DAARIO WILL DIE NO STOP IT YOU ARE RUINING MY LIFE D&DAt the end of Dance the Yunkai'i returned all of Dany's hostages via trebuchet.  I thought that Daario was amongst them, so I already assumed he was dead.
4070	protar	2013-05-21	He's supposed to be sympathetic during the trial though. That's the point of having every support taken away from him.About Shae, they can re-work the writing a bit to build up to her death next season. Sure,I admit it's going to be a bit rushed and as you said, possibly jarring. But it's not going to be absurd or ridiculous. Tyrion will be in a massive fit of rage when he gets to Tywin's chamber, and seeing Shae there will probably be enough. But that's just my opinion. I trust D&D to handle the situation as best as possible, but apparently that's not a popular opinion here.Yes he is supposed to be sympathetic in the trial. I never said otherwise. But because he's supposed to be sympathetic in the trial, there's no time for any of the less sympathetic stuff.
4071	protar	2013-05-21	At the end of Dance the Yunkai'i returned all of Dany's hostages via trebuchet.  I thought that Daario was amongst them, so I already assumed he was dead.TWOW spoiler:
	Spoiler The corpses are just pale mare victims to spread disease in Meereen. Daario, Rhakaro and Hero are all still fine IIRC.
4072	Talbot	2013-05-21	Yes he is supposed to be sympathetic in the trial. I never said otherwise. But because he's supposed to be sympathetic in the trial, there's no time for any of the less sympathetic stuff.They can have him have the singer murdered in 4x1 or whatever episode before the PW. It's not a time consuming plot point.
4073	Young Nan	2013-05-21	TWOW spoiler:
	Spoiler The corpses are just pale mare victims to spread disease in Meereen. Daario, Rhakaro and Hero are all still fine IIRC.
IIRC they never really say who the hostages were, they just say that they returned the rest of their hostages via trebuchet.  Was it actually confirmed that it wasn't Daario & Co?  I thought it was left on a cliffhanger.
4074	Master Forel's Fro	2013-05-21	it wouldn't surprise me given how much Cat has been ignored this season.According to this post, which seems accurate, Cat is 40th in the list of characters ranked by the number of lines they've had this season. 40th. The likes of Shae and Gendry are way in front of her.Is that accurate counting? Sounds about right, when I first started watching the show i never heard of D&D and I watched any YouTube videos I could find and it was like great finally a book been made by people that loved the book. Now I'm just gonna enjoy the show as a different entity to the books (i will never forgive them for killing cat) every year they are moving further from the books doesn't even matter, just come on here and complain every week.
4075	Rapsie	2013-05-21	it wouldn't surprise me given how much Cat has been ignored this season.According to this post, which seems accurate, Cat is 40th in the list of characters ranked by the number of lines they've had this season. 40th.

4077	protar	2013-05-21	They can have him have the singer murdered in 4x1 or whatever episode before the PW. It's not a time consuming plot point.Yep. Tyrion just randomly murders a singer in E1. That's poor writing. It needs at least 3 episodes to be a proper arc imo. It's not going to happen.
4078	protar	2013-05-21	IIRC they never really say who the hostages were, they just say that they returned the rest of their hostages via trebuchet.  Was it actually confirmed that it wasn't Daario & Co?  I thought it was left on a cliffhanger.I haven't read the sample in a while but
	Spoiler Daario and co are alive and well.
4079	Talbot	2013-05-21	Yep. Tyrion just randomly murders a singer in E1. That's poor writing. It needs at least 3 episodes to be a proper arc imo. It's not going to happen.Maybe. Depends on when the Purple Wedding is. GRRM is writing 4x2, so we're assuming that, but it could be 3 or 4. Definitely within the first 4. I agree it probably wont happen, but it's something they can accelerate.
4080	Versiroth	2013-05-21	Meh, I never liked Cat in the books and I couldn't care less about Cat in the show.   Sooo annoying.

4082	Versiroth	2013-05-21	For the love of god. I wonder if anyone will actually care about the RW when it happens.So.. the Red Wedding was all about Catelyn?
4083	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-21	Meh, I never liked Cat in the books and I couldn't care less about Cat in the show.   Sooo annoying.Sigh.
4084	Angmar	2013-05-21	It's obvious the show is pretty biased towards Tyrion. Cutting up and changing every other character in the storyline only for him to have the protagonism.
Same as humanizing Cersei...She ordered those bastards killed, she ordered Sansa to stay captive in KL, she sent Moore to kill Tyrion...And instead they're making her "poor sweetie" and giving all her actions to Joffrey. Ugh.
Also, I'm sick of QoT. Can she just leave already? I hate how almost every KL story obligatory has to have a scene with her. Blegh.
4085	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-21	So.. the Red Wedding was all about Catelyn?It was told through the lens of her eyes, 'ned loves my hair' the Red Wedding was Catelyn's tragedy.
4086	David Selig	2013-05-21	Meh, I never liked Cat in the books and I couldn't care less about Cat in the show.   Sooo annoying. Is there anything about this show you dislike? From what i recall, you're defending absolutely everything the showrunners have done without exception.
4087	Versiroth	2013-05-21	Sigh.Oh yeah, I forgot that you dislike when people don't agree with you.  Go ahead and tell me the rest of your opinions so I can be sure that all of my future posts please you.
4088	Versiroth	2013-05-21	It was told through the lens of her eyes, 'ned loves my hair' the Red Wedding was Catelyn's tragedy.Robbs death was a tragedy.  Catelyn?  Meh.
4089	Roose Seal	2013-05-21	Robbs death was a tragedy.  Catelyn?  Meh.Why are you even in this thread? People come here to complain because this is what this thread is for and you come here to complain about complainers. It's silly.Also, I'm sick of QoT. Can she just leave already? I hate how almost every KL story obligatory has to have a scene with her. Blegh.Me too. They're trying waaay too hard with Olenna. Her wit is so forced and not-funny.

4090	I love Cersei	2013-05-21	I did like reading a review of the episode which said when Daaro promised Dany 'My Sword is Yours, My Life is Yours, My Heart is yours', there was one body-part he forgot to mention...Me I thought that body part he mentioned before all others."My sword is yours" ...

Go ahead and tell me the rest of your opinions so I can be sure that all of my future posts please you.And here's me thinking we came to civil ground in the Theon friend. Woops. Robbs death was a tragedy.  Catelyn?  Meh.I 'sigh'ed because it's so predictable to have this attitude.
4092	Versiroth	2013-05-21	Is there anything about this show you dislike? From what i recall, you're defending absolutely everything the showrunners have done without exception.I understand completely that this is a TV adaptation and I went in from the beginning knowing very well that things would be changed.     I watch each episode with an open mind and when one of my favorite parts makes it in, I'm pleasantly surprised.  Most of the people on this board seems to have went in from a completely opposite point of view.   Instead of staying open, they focus in on the things missing and then act like this is the worst adaptation ever because some random guardsman was drinking Arbor Ale instead of Arbor Gold.  To be honest, I wouldn't watch the show at all if I had their mind frame.  It's like a religious group watching shows like Family Guy or South Park just so they can blog about it after.   Lifes too short to spend it doing things that you obviously hate.And besides that, in this very thread, I said that I disliked that Cersei actually came right out and threatened Margery.  Which is something she never did in the books.  She was more subtle.
4093	Cas Stark	2013-05-21	What are the odds there is no Lady Stoneheart?  Is Michele Farley signed on for next year does anyone know?

4096	Cas Stark	2013-05-21	I hope they keep her. It's horrible, but part of the tragedy of Cat.NOT TALISA STONEHEART.I don't see any reason why they would keep Talisa, it makes no sense plot wise, why would the BWB follow some nurse from Volantis, Cat is the widow of the Hand of the King who send Dondarrien out in the first place, hello, the daughter of Hoster Tully, the lord of Riverrun, whose people were most affected by the war....? But, given how little screen time Cat has gotten, I'm wondering if they will dispense with that whole plotline....Stoneheart hasn't done anything hugely noteworthy through Dance, and depending on what happens in the next books, they might be able to give the Jamie/Brienne stuff to someone else.

4098	Master Forel's Fro	2013-05-21	I think the show proved it doesn't need to make sense, even their writing they contradict themselves just put in enough tits no one will notice.
4099	Cas Stark	2013-05-21	If they cut Stoneheart, I'm sure a lot of people will be pissed.Many seem to think Talisa will play a Dacey type role and rush to help Robb and get killed first.Yes, but a lot of people hate Cat and hated Stoneheart even more, so I don't know, I have a bad feeling given how absent she's been all season that maybe they're doing away with zombie Cat.  I hope Talisa gets it first and I hope she doesn't have any death lines, just fucking kill her already.
4100	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-21	Yes, but a lot of people hate Cat and hated Stoneheart even more, so I don't know, I have a bad feeling given how absent she's been all season that maybe they're doing away with zombie Cat.

4101	The GreatRon	2013-05-21	If they did Talisa Stoneheart I am done, they have already ruined enough of this for me.   When naked asses get more screen time than important characters in the critical season / book, time to call it quits and do what I've done for a long time now and wait on GRRM.

4103	ScrotusMaximus	2013-05-21	Didn't really like how they did the leeching scene, for several reasons:
1) We have a scene where Melisandre is talking to Stannis about how lambs are murder-sacrificed, obviously refering to the fate awaiting Gendry. Stannis is uncertain about the whole thing, so in the next scene he consults with Davos. Then we jump to the scene where they use leeches to draw Gendry's blood in a manner non-threatening to his life.Thus, we don't get any scene where Stannis orders Melisandre to NOT kill Gendry, which is imo an important dialogue in the book, showing that Stannis wouldn't trade an innocent life even to save the kingdom.
With so few scenes involving Stannis' plot in the show, I feel they should use them to focus alot more on his character, since non book-readers I've talked to seem to have this perception of him as being some evil weirdo, which is untrue and unfair.
2) There's another useless sex scene, which I was expecting there to be since it's an HBO show after all, but which (besides taking precious time) is going to feel weird when I'm going to re-watch the show several years from now on DVD or some other media (not to mention being hard to explain to people who I'm trying to get to like the show). I'm not against this kind of scenes when they serve a purpose (like in season 1 and 2 when they were used to show Theon's character), but here it just felt weird while it was going on and even weirder after it ended and the question "What was all that for?" arose.
Also, I couldn't help but notice that Gendry's pubic hair is shaven.
Also#2, couldn't she have put all 3 leeches on his chest or something?
3) They changed the order in which Stannis curses the usurpers: Robb > Balon > Joffrey, whereas in the books it was Joffrey > Balon >Robb.
	Spoiler  The book version works better because we all kind of want Joffrey to die, but then when Balon gets his name uttered too begin to realise who's going to come next and thus we dread that final line of the chapter.
The feeling of fear for Robb's safety is hightened afterwards when we learn Balon dies "accidentaly", right after (as we now) he was cursed by Stannis. In the show we probably won't even learn of Balon's death before the RW.

What's more, he just casually throws them into the fire, whereas in the book there's a certain intensity after Stannis throws each of the first two, and after the third one the chapter ends abruptly, making it even more eerie and frightening for the reader.

4105	Mulled Wino	2013-05-21	If there's one thing I've learned from reading these boards, it's that everyone seems to have their own understanding of the characters.   It's why so many people both hate and love characters like Theon/Reek, Jaime, Cersei, Tyrion, Dany, etc.    D&D (and myself as well) see Tyrion as more of a good/gray type character and they're portraying him as such.   Just because you see the character in a different way, doesn't mean D&D doesn't have a grasp or understanding of the character(s).   Heck, if you asked them, it's you that don't have a good understanding of the characters.the problem in the scene is its all about tyrion...
4106	Masamune	2013-05-21	lol. Why is Robb taking Talisa to the Red Wedding?

In reality, marrying sansa was really about the cruelest thing the lannisters could do to sansa and the starks.  The show has characters downplaying that, its actually kind of fucked up. It crushes Stark hopes because now Cat let jamie go for absolutely no reason and their lands will possibly go to their arch-enemies.  Im personally not complaining too much over these changes with this wedding but it is CLEARLY symptomatic of multiple changes that have been implemented to the detriment of the Starks story.  That is irrefutable.oh, and many readers cant standTyriin because of the his wildly outrageous plot armor.

That's where im encamped.  Id rather they just remove the starks minus arya and maybe bran.  The only reason im excited for the rw is so show cat and show robb will be out of my life completely
4123	Roose Seal	2013-05-21	The only reason im excited for the rw is so show cat and show robb will be out of my life completelyTo be fair, Show!Cat has been out of our lives for a few episodes now /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
4124	Versiroth	2013-05-21	Talisa is going for the same reason they made her Pregnant.  Drama.  I know, I know.  The RW had enough drama already.  I agree completely, but still, that IS the reason.  Not only will Robb and Cat die, along with a lot of their bannermen.  Now, his queen and future heir will be murdered as well.
Either that, or the Blackfish will escape with Talisa for future plot strings.  I'm sure you guys would just LOVE that, lol.
4125	Trinket2	2013-05-21	I didn't realize Gendry was such a wimp, when Mel removed the leeches he sounded like he was getting tortured Theon-style.
They're just leeches, It's really not that painful.
Daario I think was miscast. IMO, he should have been more macho and more rough than pretty. They also made it seem like he joined Dany solely because he thought she was hot. It's also a bit strange how Daario can just walk into Dany's chamber while she's in the bath and grab a hostage without anybody stopping him.

4127	Mulled Wino	2013-05-21	To be fair, Show!Cat has been out of our lives for a few episodes now /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />she can still come back.  Im now praying for no uncat, another hack job waiting to happen
4128	Versiroth	2013-05-21	I HATE that they'll take the tragedy away from Cat and make it about Robb and Talisa's doomed future.Personally, it's always the way I saw it anyway.  Catelyn made so many poor choices through out the story, I didn't really like her anymore at this point anyway (plus the way she always treated Jon seemed so petty).  But, when the knife/sword turned in Robbs heart..... I was devastated.
4129	Mark Antony	2013-05-21	40th?!!?!?! WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK and to think half her screen time this season was that terrible Jon snow scene with Talisa.
4130	Angmar	2013-05-21	I said it and repeat it: The show writers only care about Dany and the Lannisters/Tyrells (except Loras, for some strange reason)
Even if the Starks are the protagonists of the story and whom our sympathy goes to the most, in the show they've turned into really dumb people who make foolish choice after foolish choice.
I wouldva much preferred sympathetic Starks over "humanized" Lannisters, bleh,
4131	Cas Stark	2013-05-21	and to think half her screen time this season was that terrible Jon snow scene with Talisa.Which turns out to have been sort of random, because it seems unlikely they're going to have to time to cram in a scene about Robb's will where Show Cat argues on behalf of Jon Snow being put in the succession line as her penance.

This season, she's had more to do, so she's gotten more screen time.  I think  that's all there is to it really.  There really aren't any main characters in this series just like there aren't any true heros or villains.   Honestly, it's more a soap opera than it's an epic Lord of the Rings type adventure story.
4134	Angmar	2013-05-21	I'm tired of that "there are no heroes or villains in ASOIAF" bullshit given to us over and over.
Joffrey is a nice guy? Cregor Clegane is good? Ramsay Bolton is a sweetie?
Also, there are certain "truly good" characters. Sansa, Bran and Brienne, for example.
It's just as annoying as those fans out there who scream "OMG GOT ALL YOUR FAVES DIE LOLOLOL!" and "GOT IS THE BEST FANTASY SERIES BECAUSE IT'S GOT SEX AND BLOOD YEAAAAH!"
These people give ASOIAF a bad rep.

Honestly, it's more a soap opera than it's an epic Lord of the Rings type adventure story.You're wrong.  The main characters are Jon Snow, Tyrion Lannister and Danaerys Targaryen.  And yes, there are also heroes and villains.  Brienne is a hero.  Ned Stark is a hero.  The NW guys who sacrifice themselves for others are heroes.  Jon Snow is a hero.  Ramsey Bolton is a villian.  Cersei Lannister is a villian.  Joffrey "Baratheon" is a villian.People misuse "gey" in place of "complex" and they end up with a different kind of simplistic view of the story, everyone is a grey character is just as simple minded as everyone is either a hero or a villian.

The hero of one side is the villain of the other side."I'd have to say that I agree with the author, GRRM here.  This is a story were everyone is capable of great good and great evil.  It's what makes his characters so compelling.  Just because Bran or Briene haven't made any morally ambiguous decisions yet, doesn't mean they wont or are incapable.   This fact makes this series interesting to read.

She never beat him, the one cruel thing she does is tell him ''it should have been you'' after she hadn't slept in days and thought her child was going to die. In a pseudo medieval society, what Cat does is actually commendable. She allows him to be almost equals to her children, certainly he is in terms of education and training. Just because she's a woman, doesn't mean she must mother him.Cat is the one that tells Robb to keep Grey Wind close, Cat gives him good political advice all the way through. Cat is an intelligent woman who is not just defined by her motherhood. She is strong. She makes the decision to take Tyrion without knowing her sister was mentally unstable but what she did know was that her childhood friend told her that the weapon was Tyrion's, the weapon sued to KILL HER SON.

4140	teemo	2013-05-21	I really enjoy The Hound and am looking forward to all of the Hound/Arya interactions, but this episode was definitely a watered down Hound.  He was like, "FWIW I saved your sister I'm not that bad u see and imma gonna take you to your uncle's wedding now."  He was more like a kind babysitter than the gruff Hound I'm used to.  Also, I call BS that calling it a "bloody wedding" would be too big of a spoiler.  Really?  The Hound has said "bloody" several times and I seriously can't imagine someone predicting a wedding massacare because of those choice of words.She was not Jon's stepmother, she owed him nothing.

She isn't your typical "badass" rebellious girl on the show like Dany, Brienne, Cersei, Shae, Talisa, Arya, etc.  Since they couldn't change her book form like they did Talisa and Shae they have chosen to ignore her.  Developing women characters that aren't badasses is too complex for them.

4141	Le Cygne	2013-05-21	In reality, marrying sansa was really about the cruelest thing the lannisters could do to sansa and the starks.Thank you.  In the inside the episode video Benioff said "he knows she doesn't want him... he's a proud man" - so why is this about him, again?  Sure, he's the star, but almost half of their viewers are women and perhaps just once they could have made it about her.

Ramsay, Roose, Tywin, Gregor, Biter etc etc are not grey characters. Brienne and Davos in contrast have done only good. If we are to say that potential dictates if your wight, black or grey then every character in every story is grey because theoretically Sauron could have done something nice. Everyone is capable of good or bad, but you have to judge a character by their actions. Tywin orders the gang rape of a child, abuses his fathers lover, orders the rape and loot of millions etc etc. Saying he could be nice doesnt cut it for meNow there are some truly grey characters and this is where George shines-Stannis, Jaime, Arya etc

4143	SlayerOfSheldons	2013-05-21	I was really annoyed by the way Stannis corrected Davos from "kill" to "sacrifice". So inconsistent with this character, if anything Stannis realizes this will be murder but thinks it's justified by some kind of greater good. To make it worse he's almost smiling when he says it. The dialogue was poorly written and poorly acted as well, which is kind of a rare deal in GoT. The actors scarcely screw up big time, but this was really awful.

Cat is a wonderful character who is definitely strong and isn't just defined by her motherhood, but oh no that was too much. Once she stopped being someone's wife, she just had to be robb's mother and made into a secondary character. Pathetic.

I wouldn't say that Sansa and Bran are totally good; but they're pretty nice and normal kids (allowing for Bran's being so precocious).  Brienne, Davos, Podrick, and Sam are have less flaws; but Sansa interests me more than Brienne (though I want them both to survive).

4149	jeffklm	2013-05-21	My only nitpick this episode is Mero and Daario's accent. They have already demonstrated what a Braavosi sounds like with Syrio, so I don't understand why they don't have Mero speak like him.
TBQH I think they missed a golden opportunity by not establishing a different accent for Essos folks in this show. It would have made the fact that Dany is in a different continent more realistic since continental differences in languages exist in our world (English, French and Spanish being the prime examples). Adopting different accents would have created a nice parallel between the two worlds.
But the show is already infamous with the whole accent inconsistency. Robb and Ned have Northern accents, but Sansa, Arya and Bran don't.
4150	giant snake	2013-05-22	Only one problem:  The order that the Leeches were thrown on the fire.  It was a lot more 'oh shit' and telling in the book.

You hit the nail on the head there with your comments about Joffrey, Gregor and Ramsay though. They are for all intents and purposes completely morally black, but Martin made an effort to give each one sympathetic traits, or at least traits which would be sympathetic in decent people. It's a little thing but it adds a bit of extra depth to even the darkest characters.Not every character has to be grey, but that's not the same as complexity.
4153	Darth Zyroth	2013-05-22	I"d like to nitpick that there aren't any new threads being approved for this week.  its been the same 20 for two days.  every other episode week has over 40Agree!!! Also, this is the bad thing about living so far and in a totally different time zone. After I watched the episode and was ready to discuss, the Sansa thread had already been closed /crying.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':crying:' /> . I was really sad, and took some of my interest about discussing in the other threads. /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />it wouldn't surprise me given how much Cat has been ignored this season.According to this post, which seems accurate, Cat is 40th in the list of characters ranked by the number of lines they've had this season. 40th. The likes of Shae and Gendry are way in front of her.THE 40TH????!!!!!! /whip.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':whip:' /> /tantrum.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':tantrum:' /> /bawl.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bawl:' />Also, I'm sick of QoT. Can she just leave already? I hate how almost every KL story obligatory has to have a scene with her. Blegh.Me too. They're trying waaay too hard with Olenna. Her wit is so forced and not-funny.I'm really tired of her, too. I cannot wait for Margaery and Tommen to marry so she can go back to The Reach. Unless the producers love her so much that decide she'll stay to help Margaery plot against Caersei, and write more scenes for her. Oh wait......

4154	Darth Zyroth	2013-05-22	I understand completely that this is a TV adaptation and I went in from the beginning knowing very well that things would be changed.	 I watch each episode with an open mind and when one of my favorite parts makes it in, I'm pleasantly surprised.  Most of the people on this board seems to have went in from a completely opposite point of view.   Instead of staying open, they focus in on the things missing and then act like this is the worst adaptation ever because some random guardsman was drinking Arbor Ale instead of Arbor Gold.  Many of us have very high expectations. We expect an outstanding adaptation of one of the best series ever written, and when we don't get that, we feel very disappointed. Excuse us for that.This thread is for nitpicking, ranting, and venting about whatever people want. You can debate the accuracy of their complaint. (i.e. I can't believe Rickon hasn't appeared this season!!) But the "it's an adaptation it's not the books" comment is not valid here. And many people here actually have valid criticism. Not just that Daario doesn't have blue hair. Of course you would know that if you actually read all the posts, instead of just calling us "whiners" and "book purists".Do you see me in the "positive nitpicking" thread saying what I hate about the show? No. I say what I loved. Do you see me there telling people they cannot love something just because I disagree? No. I don't agree with some of the comments there. But I don't say anything. Do you see me there saying that the should be more critical instead of loving everything? No. Do you see me there telling people what they cannot love? No. Then why some people come here telling us what we cannot hate? Just because they disagree and they loved that??To be honest, I wouldn't watch the show at all if I had their mind frame.  It's like a religious group watching shows like Family Guy or South Park just so they can blog about it after.   Lifes too short to spend it doing things that you obviously hate.But we don't hate the show. Why can't someone enjoy something, but still have some complaints about it? Who said someone can't love and enjoy something but still be critical about it? Why can't we both love and hate the show??? WHY??!!"Up and down," Meera would sigh sometimes as they walked, "then down and up. Then up and down again. I hate these stupid mountains of yours, Prince Bran.""Yesterday you said you loved them.""Oh, I do. My lord father told me about mountains, but I never saw one till now. I love them more than I can say."Bran made a face at her. "But you just said you hated them.""Why can't it be both?" Meera reached up to pinch his nose."Because they're different," he insisted. "Like night and day, or ice and fire.""If ice can burn," said Jojen in his solemn voice, "then love and hate can mate. Mountain or marsh, it makes no matter. The land is one.""One," his sister agreed, "but over wrinkled."To be honest with you, I'm not even sure why I come to this board at all.  I'm not nearly critical or negative enough about this adaptation to post here.   Heck, several of you actually brag about the size and ferocity of your rants!   This place is crazy town.LOL. Are you referring to me? I didn't mean to brag about it. Someone just congratulate me (for whatever reason), and I said "Thank you!". And when I said "You should've seen last week's..." I meant that it was longer. That's it, I didn't mean to brag about it. Now I cannot even say thank you to someone who liked my post just because this is the nitpick thread (and therefore my post was full of rants)??!!When did Tyrion become such a beacon for hatred with book fans?For me was when I lost complete interest in the show version of one of my favorite characters in the whole series (even after ADwD).People are pissed because he gets so many lines.Because he gets so many pointless scenes, just so he can appear in every episode while taking time away from other characters who are more important at the moment.They're pissed because he's not made out to be evil.  Etc.   Personally,Because they've taken a lot of his fascinating complexity away from him.Tyrion is easily one of my top three characters from the books and I always saw him more good than evil as well.  So, personally, I like their portrayal of him.Of POV characters, definitely my favorite. But I don't understand how can a Tyrion fan love his portrayal (except for Peter Dinklage). I find Tyrion fascinating. For me he is a "good guy", but not a "Hero". He is morally ambiguous and flawed. He is far from being perfect, and is very complex. He is the most moral of his family (at least up to ASoS), but he is a Lannister. He doesn't concern himself  with being honorable or just. He is willing to be ruthless and to go as far as necessary to acomplish his goals, and defend and help his family. He is not afraid of committing crimes. They both hate to admit it, but he is indeed his father's son. I love all that about Tyrion. But all that so far has been greatly decreased or completely taken away from him. He is just a misunderstood Hero and a witty comedy relief. He is not very complex, and he is pretty much white. I don't like that, in fact I HATE that. Where is the so interesting Tyrion I knew and loved?He's the epitome of doing a lot  with very little.   Just my opinion.Agree.

They should form a club for Westerosi Sadists or something.  Ick.  I wouldn't say that Sansa and Bran are totally good; but they're pretty nice and normal kids (allowing for Bran's being so precocious).  Brienne, Davos, Podrick, and Sam are have less flaws; but Sansa interests me more than Brienne (though I want them both to survive).  I think the point with alot of these chracters is that GRRM gives very realistic reasons for their behavior.  Joffrey, the child of incest (where it is a flip of a coin between madness and greatness) who was raised by a narcissistic mother is realistically delusional, his motivation is realistic.  With the Mt. we get the impression he was born a psychopath, same is true for Sam and Davos and Brienne
4157	RobertOfTheHouseBaratheon	2013-05-22	Why weren't Sam & Gilly terrified whilst fleeing back to the wall? There's an army of undead and monsters after them as well as a nights watch mutineer who swore to kill him. I don't mind the sword smashing but the CGI looked cheap and rubbish.
They are destroying Stannis's story like they have done Robb & Cat's. I left the books thinking Stannis is going to get the throne over Dany. Knowing D&D have been told the end and they both dislike Stannis has deflated my hopes.
I think they should have only read one book at a time, adapting that book for the series rather than read them all and go back. They could have got GRRM or a team of book fans to read and check the show changes effects. It just feels like they are rushing storylines now in a hurry to get to the end. Robb's storyline ends in this book so they've just rushed over it. They are constantly hinting things that happen later on. Stannis's vision of a battle in the snow? It's going to get very obvious he's going to show up at the wall if they keep dropping hints like this. Speeding up Theon's torture arc, we're gonna have him working for Ramsey next season as they've already done his torturing to death this.
All those interviews about how they wanted to do the Red Wedding happenned before ADWD came out. I think they read ADWD and now can't wait to get to that bit with Dany.... or where Jon.... or are looking forward to Tyrion & Jorah..... They've lost interest in Robb, the Red Wedding and storyline's that matter this season.

4159	Angmar	2013-05-22	The show's portrayal and focus has definitely made me think there is a MUCH better chance that Dany sits the IT at the end with Tyrion as her hand than I got from the books.With Olenna Tyrell as the Master of Whisperers...Yikes no please! That'd be the worst possible ending for ASOIAF.

4161	The Drunkard	2013-05-22	Robb's story is annoying. Whilst this episode was an improvement for Stannis (and that's sad) he's yet to come close to his book counterpart. The Sansa-Tyrion wedding scene was a tad annoying, but I suppose that's to be expected with Tyrion's increasing 'goodness'. That scene with Melisandre was pointless.
4162	silentwanderer	2013-05-22	I was really annoyed by the way Stannis corrected Davos from "kill" to "sacrifice".I was more annoyed by Sansa, there you have it 6 people - Tyrion, Shae, Loras, Margaery, Cersei, Tywin even - all uncomfortable by the wedding and Sansa is still making it it all about herself, just like she did on the books.

4171	protar	2013-05-22	When did Tyrion become such a beacon for hatred with book fans?  People are pissed because he gets so many lines.  They're pissed because he's not made out to be evil.  Etc.   Personally, Tyrion is easily one of my top three characters from the books and I always saw him more good than evil as well.  So, personally, I like their portrayal of him.  He's the epitome of doing a lot  with very little.   Just my opinion.Well personally I find it rather frustrating and insulting that my favourite character has been singled out to be turned into the Mary Sue knight in shining armour. It doesn't matter if you think he was mostly good in the books and it doesn't matter if someone else thinks he was mostly bad. Regardless of your opinions he has been altered, and it's been for the worse imo.
4172	silentwanderer	2013-05-22	I haven't notice any alteration to Tyrion's character the way I noticed to Gendry-Edric, Tasha-Yara and, more noticeably Jayne Westeling-Talisa from Volantis.
Even the order in which Jaime loses the hand, goes back for Brienne and takes her to King's Landing all before Joffrey's wedding, seem all the more evident to me than the Vargo-Locke change.
The way I see it, Tyrion remains as similar to his book self as Jaqen H'ghar was .

4175	Birdsong65	2013-05-22	Every Monday at work we do a "verbal nitpick" about GoT.  Of the participants, most have read the books, some many times, and two watch only the show.  Without fail, the two that watch begin with background questions along the lines of why Bolton is not with Robb & at "the other place," Where is Bran, and where is he going, Should the kids he's with be trusted...basically, questions that for readers are easy to answer, but apparently have not been made clear to an exclusively viewing audience.  Granted, some of these questions may have in fact been covered in the episodes, and they simply were not paying close enough attention, but, IMO, the questions re: Bran and Company really illustrate where D and D felt they were providing enough, but in reality, haven't as I have seen this inexplicable tendency to mistrust the Reed sibs in several forums for the unsullied.My point is, can D and D (i cannot believe I am about to suggest this, but) be blamed if the medium in which they work, HBO, requires that a substantial piece of literary work be dumbed down, paired down if you prefer, to accommodate a wider audience of sullied and unsullied who, for lack of a better description, do not posses the concentration, focus, or intellectual skills necessary to enjoy something more detailed and flush?  I'm just throwing it out there....My nitpick, regardless of the above, is, of course, the Tyrion/Sansa wedding.  For me, it is an issue of Sansa kneeling because, while it is true that she also kneeled in the book, the presentations are largely distinct from one another because of the whitewashing of Tyrion on HBO.  Because she knew of her nuptials, Sansa and Tyrion rather played it with a feeling of "well, we're both victims in this together" versus a total surprise, and Sansa refusing to kneel initially because it was the only defiant action available to her.  It is only when she realizes that Tyrion is an equal pawn, powerless, and worse, the physical manifestation of comical farce, that she kneels.  Yes, both scenes conclude at the same end, but the method by which they travel there is the difference between a complex and grey character, and a whitewashed character.  In effect, it is the very reason why there are books, and then there are adaptations.  Books are, and have always been, the more valuable and enriching of the two because it requires active participation in a way that passive viewing does not.  That said, adaptations do not, by virtue of their particular medium, have to suck balls.
4176	Cas Stark	2013-05-22	Yes, of course they can be blamed.  Whose decision was it to have Meera Reed hold a knife at Osha's throat?  Whose decision was it not to have the fire and ice oath?  Whose decision was it to have the Reeds treat Osha like a servant?  Whose decision was it to have the dialogue focus on a spat about rabbits instead of, oh, Howland Reed, or warging or some other dialogue that would clearly demonstrate the Reeds can be trusted?I LOVED the Reeds in the book and was really, really happy they decided to cast them, and I find them to be extremely annoying in the show, so its not that surprising that non book readers might wonder about them.

IDK, that seems a little altered to me, but maybe you were kidding?
4179	bobbybuilderton	2013-05-22	I think the Reed problem only exists because they were introduced in such a weird way. No sensible person would trust them. They have not been shown to be trustworthy.
I can't blame the unsullied for being suspicious, because the entire situation IS suspicious. Two kids show up out of nowhere and just start whispering in Brans ear. They say they have some relation to Ned's friend, but so what? What proof of that is there, when they haven't discussed the crannogmen? Jojen really isn't able to teach Bran everything, but what reason do the unsullied have for believing that that's true? If they'd had his vision about the sea at Winterfell they would have established that his gifts really are not fully understood. All they've done is argue with the member of the group that the audience knows they can trust and mutter what seem to be cryptic half-truths in Bran's ear.
The perception of the Reeds by unsullied would be completely different if they'd just introduced them earlier. Because as of now, I can't really justify that they should trust the Reeds without referencing the books.

Maybe you and I would understand, but they are playing to a bigger audience than just us two....so the homogenizing begins.  Whether it is right or wrong is incidental.  It has to be profitable.  Tits and ass is profitable.  True love is profitable.  Oaths spoken to a character in the woods...possibly not so much.BTW, you and I are in agreement.

Let Loras Marry Cersei, plot to get Joffrey killed and they know the Lannisters will insist that the union continue and so she must marry Tommen. Therefore removing his final bargaining chip. Then say "oh I forgot to mention, Wilas recovered from his injury and Loras isn't heir." It seems like they had everything all figured out. But what they didn't account for was that LF would steal Sansa out from under them and take her to the Vale. Then Cersei suggests sending Loras to do the stuff at Dragonstone as it presents her an opportunity to have yet another husband who died on her.Bah, probably not. It's fun to dream though...
4190	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-22	It's definitely fun! Nice to think about.

By creating a perfect heroic figure in Tyrion, they also birthed the biggest flaw of the show. Ironic.Thanks!  You know, every Wednesday Winteriscoming.net posts a collection of tweets re: the previous Sunday's airing.  I read them because they are really pretty funny, but my point is that most of them, maybe 90%, are about nudity.  I throw this out there because no amout of strict adherence to the source material is going to change the fact that an overwhelming majority of viewers rejoice in the potential, and actual showing, of boobs, asses, physical torture, and the like, if these tweets are any representation.  They are the target audience, as they are the target audience for most everything, when you really think about it.  Readers, like myself, are not the target audience.  Period.  Our use is expository in nature, TBH.  We are the people who fill in the blanks, answer the questions for plots/plotholes that TPTB deem too superfluous to air, as an adaptation.  One may not like the role, but there is no denying that it is the one readers fulfill in full.  JMO.
4197	Ran	2013-05-22	Any edited collection of tweets is going to reflect the editor's choices and not necessarily be representative sampling. Given the fact that the nudity is such a matter of joking, and given the tweet collection is largely aimed at humorous responses to the episode, it's not a surprise the nudity might be an outsized topic of conversation. Beyond that, tweets are in real-time, following the course of the episode, and so I expect there'll be more tweets about nudity during a nude scene than when there isn't a nude scene.
It'd be interesting to just randomly sample  all #GameOfThrones tweets during an episode and see whether there's proportionally more tweets during a nude scene or not. I would suspect not.

I'm not understanding you.Regardless, I believe we disagree on this as for me, real time tweets, during the first run airing are representative of the viewing public's reactions, and the number or quantity during any particular scene would suggest active involvement by the audience.  If there is an uptick during a nude scene, but less in an expository monologue scene, it would suggest that the nude scene is more "popular," there are more tweets from which to draw, thus the conclusion that more nude scenes are required is drawn.  I do, however, agree that a random sampling would be interesting in an of itself.Sorry, I think I've gone way off topic.

4207	nara	2013-05-22	What are the chances at this point, of Jaime and Cersei reconsummating their relationship upon his homecoming as in the books?  Slim to none?Very unlikely, I think.  Although Jaime was clearly relieved that Cersei is okay when he met Roose Bolton, I haven't gotten the same sense that he's still desperately in love with her, as I did in the books.  In the books, when Roose sends Pia to Jaime, he thinks about the fact that he's already committed to Cersei.  He also dreams about her rejecting him because of his lost hand and that makes him very unhappy.  In the showm they've also made the link between Jaime and Brienne more obvious than it was at this point in the books.  As unlike HBO as it is to forgo a sex scene, particularly one as intense as the sept scene, I think they'll skip it and go straight to the estrangement of the twins.

In front of their son's corpse? While Cersei is on her period? In a church? That's like shock value HBO jackpot.

4209	nara	2013-05-22	I dunno... twincest? In front of their son's corpse? While Cersei is on her period? In a church? That's like shock value HBO jackpot.  The past twin scenes have been fairly tame.  Not sure if this is because of the age of the actors, the fact that Lena Headey was pregnant during the filming of Season 1, or if name actors can say no to nudity, but I have my doubts of it appearing.  I actually think it would be one of the better sex scenes because you have 2 experienced actors so it would be more about acting than just plain nudity, but we'll see...

I actually think it would be one of the better sex scenes because you have 2 experienced actors so it would be more about acting than just plain nudity, but we'll see...There's no real nudity in the scene really. If I recall, Jaime just pulls it out of his pants and hikes up Cersei's skirt, so there's no full frontal nudity to worry about. I think they'll leave out the period part for obvious reasons, it doesn't exactly add anything that having sex in a sept in front of their boy's corpse doesn't convey.

The lack of nudity is a disincentive for HBO/the producers to show additional sex scenes between J&C.  They would rather invent a scene that isn't in the book where they can be more graphic than have one from the book that is tame.  At least, that's how I perceive what I've seen over the past couple of years. anyway, we'll find out soon enough.

It's about shock and being memorable...That's what this scene is. That's what nudity is a lot of the time, considering it's never shown on network television and sort of taboo, HBO loves to exploit it (along with violence) because it is still not status quo and shocking. No way the pass it up.
4214	silentwanderer	2013-05-22	What are the chances at this point, of Jaime and Cersei reconsummating their relationship upon his homecoming as in the books?  Slim to none?I guess it depends on a Maid of Tarth.I'd say Jaime is hopeless after the bear pit, he just doesn't know it yet.

It would be passing odd if they left this one out...To me, the point of the Sept scene was to make all the more obvious to the reader how wrong the affair really was, something I feel the show already accomplished with the bath tub scene at Harrenhal.Even if Cersei wasn't even there.

4217	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-05-22	Good point, but I'm not sure it's shocking enough, given what just happened to Theon...That's more of a gruesome, horror type of shock. Even though we've seen it on the show a couple of times and heard people talk about it, the idea of incest is still pretty gross to most people, let alone incest performed right next to a corpse. For some people that's even more shocking since we've all seen some degree of torture and pain being inflicted, whereas I don't think anyone I know can say they've watched brother and sister have sex upon an alter in a church beside their bastard son's corpse.Even typing that out feels ridiculous lol.

4219	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-23	The period twincest sex scene is disgusting but it has to be kept in, come on, it genuinely is important to show both their characters. Fucking in front of their DEAD SON, I mean seriously.
4220	Weeping Sore	2013-05-23	I guess I'm getting at...Would show Jaime do it, at this point? In the book, it's mainly Cersei's cheating that eventually turns him away, but on the show it was just Lancel (Moonboy's not even in it. /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' /> )Great scene as it is, it would throw away some of Jaime's "rehabilitation" as well as severely piss off Jaime-Brienne shippers (who have more cause on the show, certainly). I predict no.
4221	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-05-23	Jaime's redemption at this point has nothing to do with his relationship with Cersei. So being that everyone knows he's only ever been with her and loves her earnestly, I don't think it's expected that he suddenly wants nothing to do with her anymore or feels guilty about being with her.
4222	Pixi Penrose	2013-05-23	Exactly! This is exactly my problem.He is SUCH  complex character in the novels. Is he in the show? No, he's the trodden on, poor underdog 'nice' lannister who doesn't want to marry poor sansa because she'll be upset, who is kind and nice, eugh, give me a break /agree.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':agree:' />So true, it diminishes his character and makes him "the victim". My favorite thing about Tyrion in the books,and possibly why many of us love the character is the fact, that he is not depicted as a victim,but as a selfish, crafty, intelligent, flawed human being. I don't have a problem with  him being better looking in the show(I've had a crush on Dinklage since I saw The Station Agent), but I hate that they're making him out to be the victim.

It doesn't exists anymore.Whether or not he reaches King's Landing after Joffrey dies, I don't see him having sex with his sister  because there's not a shred of the man he used to be anymore. The show killed it a lot earlier than it was killed on the books.

Sansa is the victim in the marriage here, yet they've made it out to be mostly poor Tyrion.
4226	Master Forel's Fro	2013-05-23	Yes, but showing that scene will turn off a lot of viewers who were starting to come round to him. As it should do, really!!I think they should put that scene in (maybe not in the church in front of Joff's corpse) but it shows him back to what's familiar. If they cut it then maybe like they want Tyrion to be the hero, they'll play jaime as the guy on redemption road and suddenly becomes mr good which will be boring.
4227	The Boar of Gore	2013-05-23	Thinking about it, you're right. They're going to have to address his relationship with Cersei somehow and that will involve sexy times. Whether they'll go all the way or not is another matter.
4228	SerMixalot	2013-05-23	If they did Talisa Stoneheart I am done, they have already ruined enough of this for me.   When naked asses get more screen time than important characters in the critical season / book, time to call it quits and do what I've done for a long time now and wait on GRRM.I heard they are going rogue and doing Ros Stoneheart!
4229	bobbybuilderton	2013-05-23	In my dreams, Talisa dies at the red wedding the same way the Lannister boys died.
*door opens*
"Did Robb send you?"
*stab*
And that's the end of her.

Being locked up and treated like shit for a year without Cersei, he's going to practically explode when he sees her again.
4231	silentwanderer	2013-05-23	The part of him that loves Cersei will always be there (she will always be his sister). However, the part of Jaime she could manipulate, the corruption in him, has been stopped on the show. Literally and figuratively.Thinking about it, you're right. They're going to have to address his relationship with Cersei somehow and that will involve sexy times. Whether they'll go all the way or not is another matter.Jaime has to use the "Not on the Lord Commander tower!" excuse at one point or another, I just think it would be easier to use it as early as possible so that we could move on to Cersei sleeping with Lancel, the Kettleblacks and who knows who else before Tyrion is arrested..

4233	Greywolf2375	2013-05-24	I'm not even sure this is a nitpick, just something I would have liked to have seen.  When the Second Sons are leaving the tent, Dany turns to Barristan, addresses him and says (paraphrased) "you kill him first."  I would have loved to have seen Jorah's face in the background to see his reaction when his queen and love gives the job of killing that guy to someone she has had in her entourage for at most a few weeks.  The jealousy would have been huge!

4235	Pinkie Baelish	2013-05-25	The only thing that would piss me off more than Talisa Stoneheart is Talisa getting the "Jaime Lannister sends his regards" moment.
4236	Master Forel's Fro	2013-05-25	It would've been nice to see sansa wearing a stark cloak and you see the direwolf from the back, even if they didnt want too much awkwardness they could have joff remove the cloak and Tyrion to put the other one. Sansa has always been shown as a hostage it wouldn't been a nice reminder that she belongs to a house older and just as powerfull as the tyrells or lannisters.

Sansa is the victim in the marriage here, yet they've made it out to be mostly poor Tyrion.The "Tyrion is being Whitewashed" theme is valid, but...in a way it makes it a little more dramatic when he snaps and goes dark at the end of ASoS...providing that chain is significant.  At first I was worried when there was no Hand's chain, but thought "the Hand's pin looks pretty stabby."

At first I was worried when there was no Hand's chain, but thought "the Hand's pin looks pretty stabby."Hmmm... possibly, but how exactly would Shae wear that pin? (Ok, I'm just nitpicking!) On a more serious note, I wouldn't like that change, because strangling is so much more "powerful" way to kill, it really demonstrates how dark Tyrion can be.Wrt. Jaime and Cersei's period twincest in front of Joffrey's body... for a long time I thought it would be pretty much the scene HBO has always wished for, but I'm starting to think that it would indeed clash with TV Jaime's redemption progress. In the previous seasons TV Jaime was worse than book Jaime, but I have a nagging feeling that in the future episodes/seasons TV Jaime is going to be more white washed. It would be in sync with the idea of TV Tyrion's 180 degree turn if D&D actually make him kill Shae. They would basically just swap their places.
4239	Minsc	2013-05-25	Regarding Jaime, I wonder how they follow his story arc with the PW and Sansa's escape so far off in the future.  In how, there is no way that Jaime cannot get to KL before S.4.E2 thus he will be there while she is still in the city.  Thus, how can they just have sit on his hands and abandon his oath when Sansa is sitting right across the table from him for the Family Sunday Brunch?

Jaime is trying to salvage what's left of his honour, but he's still not completely pure in AFFC and I would prefer if they showed that.
4241	silentwanderer	2013-05-26	Regarding Jaime, I wonder how they follow his story arc with the PW and Sansa's escape so far off in the future.I'm more concerned about how Jaime & Brienne are going to take the news of Tyrion's wedding, they are on the same side now and this wedding is a betrayal to both of them.On the other hand, this makes Sansa his sister-in-law, which means Jaime is bound to make a choice between his family and Brienne after the point he saved Brienne from the bear pit.Since this choice was tricky enough on the books, where Jaime finds out about the marriage at Bolton's dinner, I think the Lannisters don't stand a chance on the show.Especially since Jaime & Brienne are bound to find out about Edmure's wedding before and Arya's disapperance after they are informed about Tyrion's wedding.

This season has suffered from a paucity of action and an abundance of nudity.

4249	Boi	2013-05-28	I found this entire episode to be questionable more so then any of it's predessors. I can live with this season as expectations have declined. Since season two started adding in extra script and plots. Some is easily understood making sense to help viewers be less confused with the many characters those many jumps from sceen to sceen. While also payroll and budget issues. Sadly some has been seen as ridiculous script writing. Starting down that slippery road of make it up as we go along. Keeping the main story intact but forgetting mostly how importantly those threads were woven together to create the fabric of this Epic World.I am infurated by Samwell's entire line this season. Although nothing against his character or his acting he has done a fine job. The script has been very poor. In conclusion of this episode showing the most feared creatures in Westeros currently to be little more then your average brainless zombie but effectively dumbier. Baby, Baby, Baby resemblance Brains Brains Brains Unfortunately quite Brain'less as a result.The direwolf started this season by being the Nights Watch pet Akita. Why didn't Samwell use the dragonglass obsidan dagger infront of his brothers then? Sadly on a Wight though. Believably Coldhands should have been introduced with his ravens at that point, coming to aid. Then we would have seen a more worthy Whitewalker foe. Was there any need for such naff CGI effects to mask an even worse creation. No this really wasn't horror at all for this age group. My joke on the other thread was a paranorman at this lousy CGI attempt. Game of Thrones has some of the best actors in TV. Using handcrafted sets, choice and beautiful locations. Mostly each actor has suited their roles to the letter, displaying such fine talent, using such witty dialogues. Why would this production then go and use childsplay for CGI when showing a Whitewalker, the Dragons have been magnificent? Writing the script that some zombie god shown as a feeble old withered icehermit. Followed Sam and Gilly because Castor forgot to pay his dues as offering for sacrifice his offspring. Can you see a problem here, a zombie telepath however much to brainless to use any real fighting skill. It was as scary as cartoon, but watch it explode into pretty snowflakes.Aside this episode was namely the worse for content, with it's add mish mash of unengineered, unthoughtout sceens. Showing Stannis to be weak, Davos wr'eads him well. No more baby shadows your seed has been spent, however Gendry might be useful.The kings law states burns those pretenders, who knows sheeps go baah. Dany loves to be flattered on her assets, despite of every vulgarity. Daario is a super Ninja even if out of character 2handed weapon of choice, not colourful, but youthful, clean shaven, having no real accent.The wedding and between sceens were a pleasant break from the other questionable pageantry. Which one has come to expect from this show of late. Some great dialogue on the lore of Castamere, evil Cersi. Tyrion's halfwit when drunk was enough to dumbfound Joffrey. Great viewing.I don't find nudity to be an issue if keeping in theme to the setting, which should be specific to what that sceen accomplishes. Dany in the tub was absurd when any tom, dick, or hairy can sneek a peek to give head or get ahead? Melisandre's porno was what you would expect from a she witch. In nature with those kind of occultist rituals, forgetting Stannis the wimp doesn't claim his druid rights.Well I love the show, hated this episode unforgiveable Whitewalkers

He hasn't been since he promised Brienne to return Catelyn's daughters all by himself, if not their nude scene at the bath tubs of Harrenhal.This Jaime seems more likely to get mad at Tyrion for marrying one daughter than he is to have sex with the woman who misplaced the other.

4251	Dragon greyscale	2013-05-28	Given the flack they've received over their liberal use of sex and nudity, a scene where two people have incestuous sex next to their son's corpse will be absolutely torn to shreds and blasted for being tasteless and an addition used for simple shock value.That's my point though. Criticism about gratuitous scenes have only exacerbated them (Theon, Pod anyone?) Controversy sells, regardless of the artistic merit.Having said that, I can imagine them cutting the fact that the corpse is literally in the same room. My best guess is that they'll have sex after having walked away from their dead son.
4252	bobbybuilderton	2013-05-28	Not being in Jaime's head makes the periodsexnexttodeadson EVEN STRANGER. We haven't seen how they justify their relationship since season 1 when Cersei told Ned. We don't see how he's ONLY ever been with Cersei. We don't see how conflicted he is. We just barely see that he was a little turned on (and confused by that) in the bath scene. In the eyes of show only viewers, he has turned a new leaf. Immediately screwing Cersei the first chance he gets will not make sense to them. At least not if it's close to his dead son. If it does happen, I assume they will just show them trying to but him  being conflicted and her obviously being disgusted by his stump.
4253	mafalda	2013-05-28	Actually, I'm more concerned about Barristan not whooping anyone's ass this season.He's supposed to be one of the greatest warriors of Westeros, let him show off!He hasn't done anything this season! The manticore scene was not as exciting as I thought, especially since Jorah managed to get a hold of Barristan, before Barristan kills it. Ugh.And I wonder WHY they're completely cutting out the whole Jorah is in love with Dany scenario. At this point in the books, he's made so many passes at her! The only thing that's been mentioned of his love for her was in S1 when Viserys says to him "You don't think I see how you look at my sister?" but nothing since!
4254	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-05-28	Not being in Jaime's head makes the periodsexnexttodeadson EVEN STRANGER. We haven't seen how they justify their relationship since season 1 when Cersei told Ned. We don't see how he's ONLY ever been with Cersei. We don't see how conflicted he is. We just barely see that he was a little turned on (and confused by that) in the bath scene.

But all I remember from S2 is her awkwardly caressing his face when they were trying to get back her dragons. I'm also curious about the handmaiden scene... lol, I thought that was the entire reason they aged up Missandei!

But I have seen many-a tv-only viewer think two things1)He and Cersei are over when he gets back2) He will have to leave the Kingsguard because of his inability to fight. Which is because they see as necessary in order to defend the king.
4257	Joyful Union	2013-05-28	And I wonder WHY they're completely cutting out the whole Jorah is in love with Dany scenario. At this point in the books, he's made so many passes at her! The only thing that's been mentioned of his love for her was in S1 when Viserys says to him "You don't think I see how you look at my sister?" but nothing since!Jorah tells Dany "Sometimes I look at you, and I still can't believe youre real" in S2, can't remember which episode.
4258	bobbybuilderton	2013-05-28	Jorah tells Dany "Sometimes I look at you, and I still can't believe youre real" in S2, can't remember which episode.Plus "Will you betray her again?" and his super dramatic "Never" made it pretty clear to me. But then again, you'd think that that ALSO made it clear he betrayed her in the first place. But there are many who somehow did not pick up on it. Despite being explicitly told that they knew she was pregnant due to Jorah. Clearly some viewers just don't pay attention
4259	mafalda	2013-05-28	Jorah tells Dany "Sometimes I look at you, and I still can't believe youre real" in S2, can't remember which episode.True. But he's kissed her so many times by this point in ASoS. This whole season has gone by without him hinting at her, I was just wondering if they're giving that arc the boot or not. They have had their brief S1 and S2 moments, but nothing from the season where he really tries to go after her.
4260	protar	2013-05-28	True. But he's kissed her so many times by this point in ASoS. This whole season has gone by without him hinting at her, I was just wondering if they're giving that arc the boot or not. They have had their brief S1 and S2 moments, but nothing from the season where he really tries to go after her.He's kissed her once at this point. And seeing as she'll probably spend most of S4 taking Meereen that's like 2 chapters (IIRC) adapted into the majority of her season 4 arc. So it makes sense that they're shifting some material forwards, and probably they'll use it to emphasise the Jorah/Daario rivalry which will no doubt be built up towards the end of this season and into the next.
4261	ExBruinsFan	2013-05-28	Actually, I'm more concerned about Barristan not whooping anyone's ass this season.He's supposed to be one of the greatest warriors of Westeros, let him show off!He USED TO BE.It might even be that the actor is not up to the task. From a practical standpoint, some of the casting has been poor. Not a great idea to hire performers likely to be dead soon.

4263	silentwanderer	2013-05-28	Jorah tells Dany "Sometimes I look at you, and I still can't believe youre real" in S2, can't remember which episode.To be fair, Jorah has been too busy competing with Ser Barristan to make a pass at Dany this season.Not that they have actually show off their skills in battle to have something to compare them with.Not being in Jaime's head makes the periodsexnexttodeadson EVEN STRANGER. We haven't seen how they justify their relationship since season 1 when Cersei told Ned. We don't see how he's ONLY ever been with Cersei. We don't see how conflicted he is.

If it does happen, I assume they will just show them trying to but him  being conflicted and her obviously being disgusted by his stump.If anything, the show stressed out the mirror image between him and Brienne ever since the rape scene, the whole season has been a back and forth between what Jaime would've done if he was Brienne and what Brienne would've done if she was a Jaime.There're hints Brienne would have done the same thing to her 'precious Renly' if he would've gave the same orders the Mad King did throughout the bath scene.Not to mention, several hints Ser Jaime would've returned Catelyn's daughters should something happen to Brienne; he's not conflicted anymore, not at Bolton's table, not at the bear pit, not even the last time he speaks to Locke.His first instinct is still to go back to the other half of himself. Thing is, on the show, that other half isn't Cersei.

4264	Boi	2013-05-28	So much procastination on what might happen, could happen, won't happen. Little effect on this episode. Past and done, won't happen Jamie - Brienne logistically to be just slightly a little awkward even viewers can acknowledge that. Jamie - Cersi  as a sceen later would cause much effect. Undoubtedly Cersi has been swooning enough to get stumped from his encounter. Where it will happen in which setting is debatable. Having to happen to an extent, inevitable as that tension will need to be shown. Maybe he will go and find Brienne afterwards, highly doubtful.From this episode one could have imagined Jon giving Ygritte another go.. If still on those themes but wasn't there enough of that content?Tryion - Sansa happened after their wedding night? Maybe to be glossed over though with last couple episodes remaining enough content outside of that theme for characters to keep us as occupied. Jorah - Dany.  Kissing, not much build up with either characters amidst the many battles and conquests, if it happens or when it does is when they will go their separate ways. Presumably he will try, she will give him a slap call him a betrayer, he will be heart broken and banished. She has got a pet ninja, and a handmaiden in her pocket really doesn't want a bear too. No teddies allowed!

4265	The Roose is Loose	2013-05-28	All the "chess pieces" on Robb's map are too uniform.  They look like they were all cast in a plastic mold, especially all the lion heads representing Lannister troops.  They should each be a little different and have a more hand carved look to them.

4268	lilbowwow	2013-05-29	I have a few questions about Walder Frey and Lord Bolton not particularly relevant to the latest episode, but something I have been thinking about and actually more relevant to "The Bear and Maiden Fair" Episode.
What happened to Frey's men that Stark took in Season 1? Supposedly Robb received about 2000 or so I believe and 400 stayed at The Twins in Season 1. I guess his men left for the Twins after Robb married Talisa in Season 2. And now he is going back for more as supposedly he has a great number? Will that make that much of a difference in attacking Casterly Rock if Walder supposedly has that many men. I guess we may find out next episode the numbers.
Secondly, why would Lord Bolton release Jaime so easily? Bolton released Jaime only if he told Tywin that it was not him who cut his hand off? Sounds like Bolton is scared of Tywin? Is he trying to back out, does he not agree with Robb's tactics lately? Robb surely won't like this if he finds out and I am skeptical how this will play out. I don't see Bolton, the man who flays his captives, as someone who would release Jaime so easily? What the hell?

I don't see Bolton, the man who flays his captives, as someone who would release Jaime so easily? What the hell?The title warns of book spoilers so I guess its ok to answer your question. Roose is scared of Tywin and is in the process of selling Robb out to him in exchange for his treason against the crown being forgiven.

4271	lilbowwow	2013-05-29	Yeah that's fine, I just started with the series, almost done with the first book. They are long!

4273	Ghosteline	2013-05-30	Honestly, I don't like Danys scenes anymore. She is forcing the fiercness on her and it shows. Shes actually too sweet and soft-spoken. And the constant proud smirks and looks on Barristan and Jorahs faces are just too corny for me. Sorry just too much like a kids play there. Dany should roughen up a bit - like help her with makeup artists to make the eyes darker or whatever.

I love that version of Dany... they should use it more often.She seems to spit fire when she speaks Valyrian ... /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' /> ... should stick with that demeanor.

4278	Queen of Whores	2013-04-04	I haven't heard any casting news about him so I guess they're probably cutting him, which will be a shame. They'll probably have Daario take his place.

4281	Ser Dermett Corbray	2013-04-14	do u know who they cast or this role?Nobody. Yet. Likely to be introduced next season, as Jarl said.Clarke Peters will play him, it is known. *sagenod*
4282	Harald Hard-Ruler	2013-04-14	do u know who they cast or this role?    http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2075330/										  Mark Kileen, he looks perfect for the role, could have made an awesome Balon Swann too.
4283	TheEvilKing	2013-04-20	My bet is the Titan's Bastard is leader of the Second Sons, and Daario is his second-in-command. Daario kills him assumes the command.
4284	protar	2013-04-20	My bet is the Titan's Bastard is leader of the Second Sons, and Daario is his second-in-command. Daario kills him assumes the command.I thought that Daario would be introduced earlier, as the leader of the Storm Crows like in the books. Going by episode titles the Second Sons won't be introduced until episode 8. Also Daario and Brown Ben have very divergent roles especially in ADWD. I think it more likely that Ben will be his own character but will perhaps be merged with the Tattered Prince, resulting in a complex character who plays both sides of the conflict.
4285	jeffklm	2013-04-20	My bet is the Titan's Bastard is leader of the Second Sons, and Daario is his second-in-command. Daario kills him assumes the command.I agree. Or they're making Daario himself the Titan's Bastard. IDKI'm guessing that they would delay introducing the Stormcrows because there are already so many characters in the series. I could see the Stormcrows being relocated to Meereen for next season and Dany will acquire them there.
4286	SerArthurHeath	2013-04-22	Ben Plumm isn't even mentioned in anything other passing until the season 4 bit of aSoS anyway
4287	miguel sanchez	2013-04-24	This isn't something that needs to be changed much from the books imo, Daario can be one of the 3 leaders of the stormcrows and kill the other 2 in the night, Mero the captain of the second sons accepts the wine off Dany and all that stuff. Remember Barristan kills the titans bastards when he tries to kill Dany in Meereen, that could just happen this season... or next, doesn't matter. But Brown Ben gets introduced next season. It works.
4288	Garlan Marius	2013-05-02	For the sake of cutting down the cast, I could accept BBP and Daario being merged.  Dany's love interest and the pseudo-traitor being one person would actually make the meeting between him and Tyrion (and Jorah) more interesting when they get around to the end of ADWD.
4289	wwwidonja	2013-05-04	It would be really interesting if they merged BBP and Daario into one, but I think it could be a problem for WoW. In ADWD it would actually be pretty good, as 
	Spoiler Dany's hunny bunny would betray her, then join with Tyrion, etc.
 but later, Daario and BBP would seem to be in different places at the same time, both being important, no?
4290	Stark Winds	2013-05-10	http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2075330/										  Mark Kileen, he looks perfect for the role, could have made an awesome Balon Swann too.That is scarily accurate to how I imagined him O.o
4291	Jazzman	2013-05-11	They're maybe waiting to introduce Brown Ben Plumm in season 4?
4292	thewalkindude19	2013-05-12	My bet is the Titan's Bastard is leader of the Second Sons, and Daario is his second-in-command. Daario kills him assumes the command.Given that Daario and Prendahl have been cast, I imagine the situation with the Storm Crows going down much as it did in the books. Same with Mero, and then Brown Ben can be introduced next season. Or not.
4293	ebevan91	2013-05-12	Who was the guy with Daario in the Ep8 preview?
4294	Nick_Scryer	2013-05-13	Who was the guy with Daario in the Ep8 preview?Mero and Prendahl I think.
4295	PatrickStormborn	2013-05-13	Brown Ben Plumm doesn't appear until he's elected leader of the Second Sons in Dany's fifth ASoS chapter, so I was never expecting him to show up this season. But with the Stormcrows and the Second Sons being merged I'm not sure what his role will be now, or if he'll even make it into the series.
4296	Gonzalo	2013-05-13	Mero and Prendahl I think.Indeed, thats Prendahl. They are merging the separate meetings with the Stormcrows and the Second Sons into one. Sallor the Bald has also been dropped
4297	Gordon Freeman	2013-05-13	I woudn't be too surprised if they did Ben the same way they did Vargo. By just intruducing basically the same character but someone who can be adapted to suit any role that the show needs him to. This way the purist aren't screaming "Brown Ben never did that".
4298	The_Gallows_Knight	2013-05-14	I woudn't be too surprised if they did Ben the same way they did Vargo. By just intruducing basically the same character but someone who can be adapted to suit any role that the show needs him to. This way the purist aren't screaming "Brown Ben never did that". Would people actually be that upset if Brown Ben did do something he didn't do in the books? He's nor exactly a major player and has pretty much one or two major characteristics, switching sides and being liked by dragons.
4299	_Oberyn_	2013-05-14	This way the purist aren't screaming "Brown Ben never did that".No one cares about the readers. And to the  purists the show is just a joke at this point anyway, or it should be.
4300	Tom son of Tom	2013-05-14	So the Stormcrows are out?
I guess Daario and Prendahl are second in command to Mero in the Second Sons. Daario will kill them to bring the SS over to Dany in this episode.
4301	Frumpus	2013-05-14	Don't know why anyone is worried about how all of this character cutting will affect the story when they get to ADwD. By the time they get that far, enough plotlines will have diverged that they will be writing original storylines instead of following the books. Tyrion's adventures in ADwD may very well be completely different compared to what he does in the books, with only major highlights occurring for him (such as getting a glimpse of Dany, etc.)
4302	Don Roberto	2013-05-14	Brown Ben can't be written out or changed into a new character, basically because he's a Plumm and that seems like it will make all the difference in Winds of Winter.
They could, however, introduce him differently, perhaps as the captain of another sellsword band that'll turn to Dany's side, only this time in Meereen. He could even take part of Strong Belwas' storyline and be the one to slay Oznak zo Pahl, making it a gift to Daenerys and proof that he really turned sides.
4303	Tone	2013-05-14	I'm still hopeful they will introduce Strong Belwas next season.
4304	Conchobar	2013-05-15	Who was the tanned dude to the right of Daario with the long black hair in the preview?

4305	Tom son of Tom	2013-05-15	Who was the tanned dude to the right of Daario with the long black hair in the preview?Prendahl, played by Ramon Tikaram - http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0863130/http://awoiaf.wester...endahl_na_Ghezn
4306	Kasrith	2013-05-15	I'm still hopeful they will introduce Strong Belwas next season.I'm pretty sure I read from GRRM that he won't be
4307	Conchobar	2013-05-16	Prendahl gets killed by Daario right?
4308	Where Boars Glow	2013-05-16	The Titans Bastard led them at first and he is a character this season, so its possible that Ben is introduced next season.Thats actually how the book was. Titans bastard led them at first until his assasination attempt
4309	Honourable Ser	2013-05-16	Daario to save Dany from the Titan's Bastard. I don't see any need for it to be Barristan, as his identity has already been revealed. On top of this, Ian McElhinney claimed on twitter that he hasn't had to practice sword fighting etc. for his role. As such, I'm saying Daario and Ser Jorah to be the ones who go into the sewers of Meereen/Yunkai, whatever it is the writers plan.

As such, I'm saying Daario and Ser Jorah to be the ones who go into the sewers of Meereen/Yunkai, whatever it is the writers plan.That makes the most sense - Dany really doesn't start to trust Daario for a while so it's a good way for him to earn it (and Barristan has no need to in the show)Elio also thinks Daario will face Oznak zo Pahl at Mereen since by all accounts Strong Belwas has been written out.
4311	Honourable Ser	2013-05-16	That makes the most sense - Dany really doesn't start to trust Daario for a while so it's a good way for him to earn it (and Barristan has no need to in the show)Elio also thinks Daario will face Oznak zo Pahl at Mereen since by all accounts Strong Belwas has been written out.Personally, I can see them doing away with Oznak completely, since it doesn't really drive the narrative too much.
4312	Blind Beth the Cat Lady	2013-05-17	Whatever they call him, I think the story kind of needs a "Daario foil," i.e. someone who seems trustworthy and then isn't as opposed to Daario seeming like a skeezbag and then turning out to be suprisingly loyal.
4313	Tom son of Tom	2013-05-18	Prendahl gets killed by Daario right?In the books, yes. I'm guessing Daario will end up killing both him and Mero this episode.
4314	Carcetti	2013-05-18	Personally, i think there need to be 2 sellsword companies, as one of them really needs to betray dany for gold, pick up tyrion outside the gates of mereen, turn again and help out in the battle. This company doesn't neccesarily have to be the one introduced next episode though. Daario could be leading the second sons (after killing Mero), and introduce the storm crows later on with Plumm leading them.
In the long run, it'll get confusing with 3 sellsword companies, some companies of freedmen (if they bother) and the unsullied, but it's not impossible /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />.
4315	Words of Winter	2013-05-18	I think they will give us Plumm next season.  That way they don't need to cast him until next season.
4316	Mr Smith	2013-05-19	Pretty sure the stormcrows are being merged with the second sons, which suggests to me that Daario will be second in command to the Titan's Bastard. If Brown Ben Plumm is included at all, I think he'll be separate from the Second Sons. They need to cut down the characters in Mereen anyway, there are waaayyy too many for the viewers to keep track of. They probably cut Belwas for the same reason, and I can't say I'm complaining.
4317	The Night's Prince	2013-05-19	Strong Belwas got hosed. What a joke.
4318	silentwanderer	2013-05-19	Personally, i think there need to be 2 sellsword companies, as one of them really needs to betray dany for gold, pick up tyrion outside the gates of mereen, turn again and help out in the battle. This company doesn't neccesarily have to be the one introduced next episode though. Daario could be leading the second sons (after killing Mero), and introduce the storm crows later on with Plumm leading them.There has to be at least two companies or Frog Martell's, Tyrion Lannister's and Connington's plots - and, by extension, "Griff Jr." plot -won't make sense.Victarion Greyjoy could always lead a Company instead of just a fleet, but that's about as different as the show could make them.There's no way the Second sons is the only company on this show, in my opinion.

4320	Lord Elrosir	2013-05-19	Why are there almost no threads open tonight for this episode?
4321	iheartseverus	2013-05-19	Anyone have any idea why the other thread got locked?  Length, maybe?
4322	ebevan91	2013-05-19	So this is basically our pre-episode discussion thread now, right?
4323	iheartseverus	2013-05-19	So this is basically our pre-episode discussion thread now, right?Well, I vote yes, since we basically have no other options.  Weird situation...
4324	Filleted Man	2013-05-19	Since the other thread got locked, I'll post this here:I posted that in the other thread but for some reason my post was deleted when it closed. No idea why.Personally though, I wonder how much time the wedding will get in the episode overall, it seems like at least 20 minutes or so, perhaps more.We have:PreparationsActual wedding at septwhatever that conversation with cersei isconversation of Tyrion with various characters as he gets drunkConfrontation with JoffreyBeddingDoesn't seem like to much time for the other storylines.
4325	iheartseverus	2013-05-19	Just curious, has anybody submitted thread requests for this episode, (other than a Major Spoilers thread which I and several others submitted) and they just haven't yet been approved?  I'm guessing that's the case, and further guessing that its just that Ran is busy or whatever, and that threads will begin showing up later tonight and overnight.  Can't imagine that no one's submitted a Good Nitpick or a Bad Nitpick or any of the other usuals.  I don't remember ever seeing this 'no threads' situation before.  A bit strange...
4326	go joff go	2013-05-19	I'm curious about the amt of time each storyline gets too since the previws hint at what seem like big and multiple and long scenes for each character.  Also the length of the wedding storyline in this episode will probably give a hint to how much RW is in eps 9
4327	Weeping Sore	2013-05-19	There has to be at least two companies or Frog Martell's, Tyrion Lannister's and Connington's plots - and, by extension, "Griff Jr." plot -won't make sense.Victarion Greyjoy could always lead a Company instead of just a fleet, but that's about as different as the show could make them.There's no way the Second sons is the only company on this show, in my opinion.I bet a silver stag Quent Martell and Aeron Greyjoy will be cut altogether, at least as on-screen characters. People are really not coming to terms with how major the changes are going to get by the second half of S4.
4328	WinterWarrior	2013-05-19	I think Brown Ben Plumm will be introduced in Tyrion's arc....when the events towards the end of Book 5 start playing out. A few years away yet. No real need to introduce him now.
And I don't see Daario deceiving Dany. I think he will be true blue as he is in the books. Maybe because I am a romantic and he has such wonderful blue eyes......hmmmm
4329	Lord Paolo Stark	2013-05-19	No Ben Plumm? ah, comon! and Daario was supposed to be in the Storm Crows, why they change so much the stuff

People are really not coming to terms with how major the changes are going to get by the second half of S4.Aeron I agree with his only contribution is the Kingmoot and you could just have that be Ironborn tradition.but Quentyn  leads to  Dorne rethinking its alliance with Dany. that's kind of a major plot point..............and  theyre going to need some action for Mereen.
4332	Ororo727 Jon Snow Fangirl	2013-05-21	Nobody. Yet. Likely to be introduced next season, as Jarl said.Clarke Peters will play him, it is known. *sagenod*He would make an excellent BBP.

Maybe because I am a romantic and he has such wonderful blue eyes......hmmmmThey could just have most of the "Second Sons" as they are called on the show defect to the slavers' side, with Daario staying with Dany. There doesn't have to be a second company, just someone to get a majority of the sellswords to jump ship (This could be BBP or a BBP replacement). I don't think they can dispense with the Golden Company, for the sake of Aegon/JonCon's invasion, so I think two sellsword companies total will max out the viewers' appetite for complexity.

I think they'll keep it to one sellsword company initially, just to avoid confusing viewers, and then change the storyline up a little to have some or all of them turn their cloaks, then come back.  It's simpler that way, because I don't think they can avoid having the Golden Company in the show, they're too relevant to the Aegon storyline. Honestly, I usually object to a lot of the show changes, but I would be ok with only the second sons.  Most of the Mereen storyline was bloated with unnecessary extra characters, it could use a little paring down.
4335	Weeping Sore	2013-05-21	Aeron I agree with his only contribution is the Kingmoot and you could just have that be Ironborn tradition.but Quentyn  leads to  Dorne rethinking its alliance with Dany. that's kind of a major plot point..............and  theyre going to need some action for Mereen.Kingsmoot will be paired down to Euron, Victarion & "Yara".I really think Quent could just exist offscreen at Yronwood. Dorne has original Arienne match with Viserys. After Viserys dies, Varys contacts Doran in secret about "Young Griff", but Doran is skeptical and bides his time. Somebody else releases Dany's dragons. POV eliminated. All the same stuff happens with Oberyn, Arienne, & Sandsnakes. Where's the problem?
4336	The Dragon has three heads	2013-05-21	My bet is the Titan's Bastard is leader of the Second Sons, and Daario is his second-in-command. Daario kills him assumes the command.On the money
4337	MercyTheBlindUglyLittleCat	2013-05-22	I think Brown Ben might make it into next season.
4338	Red Knight	2013-05-22	it'd be real shame if they cut him
he is interesting character
4339	Magjee	2013-05-24	He's likely been removed and the different Mercenary camps have all been rolled into the Second Sons.
4340	Sword of the Mornin'	2013-06-05	If there is some way they could get Billy Dee Williams to play Brown Ben, I would give HBO all of my money.
4341	Newstar	2013-05-24	Yeah, so this line from Tyrion to Sansa raised my book reader hackles a little.I've noticed that whenever a character in this series makes a big show of promising that he or she will never do something, or stating confidently that another character would never do something, events have a way of proving them wrong (Catelyn's vow never to ask Brienne any service that would bring her dishonour, ahem). So what should we make of TV Tyrion's promise to Sansa never to hurt her?The line kind of seemed like a tweaked-for-TV version of Tyrion's line to Sansa in ACOK "I vow I shall not savage you" (complete with reassuring hand/arm squeeze), but the writers didn't need to include it in 3x08, so why is it in there? Also, it seems like a little thing, but Book Tyrion promised he wouldn't hurt (well, savage) Sansa, not that he would never hurt her. That "never" bugs me. It could be something innocuous, like setting up Tyrion's decision later in Season 4 (presumably) not to implicate Sansa in Joffrey's murder, or it could be something less innocuous.Now, going off the books, as of ADWD, Tyrion hasn't done anything to hurt Sansa and hasn't "savaged" her, either, so maybe this will be a promise that Tyrion (both in the books and the show) winds up keeping; heck, Tyrion and Sansa may never even meet again in the books. On the other hand, if Tyrion continues to spiral into straight-up villainy, even though he doesn't have any specific revenge plans against Sansa at the moment (as opposed, to, say, Cersei), that could change in a hurry if he returns to Westeros and decides to cross the Vale off his revenge list. There's been a lot of speculation that Tyrion is in fact the "savage giant" Sansa is prophesied to slay as per the Ghost of High Heart's prophecy. While I have my doubts about that, personally, I can see a conflict in the Vale with Sansa on the Vale's side and Tyrion on the other.So, what do you think? Foreshadowing of Tyrion hurting (or trying to hurt) Sansa down the line? Or just a tweaked version of book dialogue?
4342	Woman of War	2013-06-02	Didn't you, Newstar, post yourself that Tyrion simply does not have enough emotion towards Sansa in him to commit a crime of hate against her but that he hardly thinks of her?It was in the Shae thread of E08May I quote you about the question if Tyrion might strangle Sansa:I dunno. He's not "always" thinking she betrayed him. He lumps her in with Shae and with other "false" women the one time in ADWD, but his reaction to Sansa fleeing her marriage in ASOS is "What did you expect?" In ADWD, he seems pretty unconcerned about her. He calls her "false" the one time, as I said, but he also compares Penny "with all her pretty dreams" to Sansa late in ADWD, whom he describes as "the child bride he wed and lost" and not, say, as "that conniving, heartless bitch who framed me for murder." Whatever negative or resentful feelings he does hold towards Sansa as of ADWD--and he really doesn't seem to think much about her one way or the other--seem pretty mild for someone who has every reason to believe she murdered Joffrey and left him to take the blame for it. Honestly, he seems more pissed off in ASOS about her refusal to kneel at the wedding than anything else, and in ADWD, he can't even be bothered to think about that.Considering how much foreshadowing is allegedly hidden in every word ever written and said about Sansa there might though be a lot of it in " astonishingly long neck" /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' /> . CAREFUL! JOKE!

4343	Newstar	2013-06-02	Yeah, Woman of War, I've flipflopped on this a few times (I wrote this post last week, I guess it got eaten by the boards in the interim). But I've learned to be wary of characters promising "never" to do something in this series.

4344	Woman of War	2013-06-03	Of course this phrase can be a strong indicator. Though I do not think that Tyrion would harm Sansa intentionally it is still possible that she might be a tragic victim of some attack, e.g. on The Eyrie with dragons, as collateral damage, driving Tyrion even deeper into a guilt and madness spiral because he failed all his women.
A propos: "and if I never want you to.....", seriously, this is the sentence pending that might easily be proven wrong, so much "never" in it.
4345	mykelsss	2013-05-19	During the preview, there's a shot where Arya's surroundings look exactly like the RW's (as we've seen from other stills, as well as some from this preview). People were wondering how her character development would catch up (she's been getting darker now, but Harrenhal seemed to have little effect on her). This would really drive the point home. http://postimg.org/i...heckdk4vf/full/
4346	Kienn	2013-05-20	Probably from outside sure... not sure what you think you're seeing in 3 frames of her with the Hound behind her and an orange splotch behind him.
4347	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2013-05-20	in the books aren't there people running out where the wedding is being held?
4348	Words of Winter	2013-05-20	in the books aren't there people running out where the wedding is being held?Yeah,  They burn down the tents outside after collapsing them on the soldiers and systematically kill with arrows or the sword anyone who escapes. IIRC.  Arya is amidst the outside killing while trying to get to the towers to save her family.  The Hound pulls her back, she fights him off and he knocks her out.Edit: Grammar

4350	Mr Smith	2013-05-20	Surely this should go in the Episode 9 thread?

4353	GoldenFleece	2013-05-20	....What?The trailer shows Jorah and Daario devising a plan to sneak into Yunkai via the sewers (by the looks of it), that was Meeren not Yunkai in the books.  Dany didn't set foot in Yunkai.  Could be the show is going to show Dany try and rule Yunkai while Meereen will be the antagonist.
4354	Queen of Whores	2013-05-20	The trailer shows Jorah and Daario devising a plan to sneak into Yunkai via the sewers (by the looks of it), that was Meeren not Yunkai in the books.  Dany didn't set foot in Yunkai.  Could be the show is going to show Dany try and rule Yunkai while Meereen will be the antagonist.I believe Jorah said something like "or you could be leading Grey Worm and I into the slaughter." I took this to mean Jorah (rightfully) didn't really trust Daario and his battle plans. Also, it would be Jorah and Barristan sneaking in the sewers, not Jorah and Grey Worm. Plus there is no way they'd cut Meereen for so many reasons. Just this episode they mentioned it in passing a couple of times. It would also mean completely different circumstances for Dany finding out about Jorah being a spy, and her storyline would be pushed way too far ahead of the others'. She needs to conquer three cities, otherwise what will she do in season 4? Start ruling already? By the time she is ruling, Tyrion is on his way to her. If she started ruling at the start of season 4, Tyrion would still be sitting in King's Landing, unhappy with his marriage. We all know Mysha will end Dany's arc this season, so I see maybe four to five episodes next season on her conquering Meereen, then banishing Jorah, locking her dragons and getting married, with the last point being her season 4 ending.I know I went a bit off topic there, sorry.
4355	ser benjamin	2013-05-20	Not to sound snarky,  but just because it isnt in the next episode... or even this season... doesnt mean it is cut from the series.  If they are playing "the long game"  (one more season for ASoS and 2-3 seasons for books 4 and 5)  Dany could spend 3 whole seasons taking/messing around in Meereen and maybe 1 or 2 episodes at the end of (season 6???) surrounding her flight and encounter.     This season ends with the sac and conquest of Yunkai... Meereen (and even Belwas) will be introduced on march of 2014.

I did note that one of the three coins that the TItan's Bastard used to decide who should sneak into her camp and kill Dany was "from Meereen".  Plus we had a reference earlier in the series to "a Meereenese knot".  So the place does exist in the TV version of Essos.  Whether we see it or not, probbably have to wait until season 4.

4360	Faint	2013-05-20	I believe Jorah said something like "or you could be leading Grey Worm and I into the slaughter . . . Not to sound snarky,  but just because it isnt in the next episode... or even this season . . . The series will probably not last as long you two might imagine (see here). I don't think that means they will necessarily cut out Meereen but I am actually expecting them to speed up Daenerys' story significantly.

4363	Winter's Prince	2013-05-20	Since Dany's so popular on the show, and given the fact she was absent in the last half of ASOS, the writers may push Mereen to next season
4364	Titan	2013-05-20	Since Dany's so popular on the show, and given the fact she was absent in the last half of ASOS, the writers may push Mereen to next seasonThat part is pretty obvious. As soon as we knew that "Mhysa" was the title of the final episode, it was clear that Mereen would not appear until season 4.
4365	juanml82	2013-05-20	Well, we have to assume she'll take Yunkai by the season finale, so she should be attacking Mereen next season. I guess Season 5 will show Danny trying to rule it
4366	The Pain Yak	2013-05-20	Since Dany's so popular on the show, and given the fact she was absent in the last half of ASOS, the writers may push Mereen to next seasonThey almost certainly will.

An unnamed woman asks her if she has ever been to Mereen. I agree that we won't see it til season 4 and I think it will take her the entire season to conquer it or at least until episode 9.

4371	Nezzer	2013-05-20	I get the feeling KL won't be in next episode. There's nothing from KL in the preview nor in the recap. It might be the first episode in the entire show we KL and Tyrion are not seen. So it looks like the episode will include only:
-The Red Wedding, obviously, with some scenes of Robb planning his campaign to give false hope
-Arya and the Hound arriving at the Twins, with some tension building between them in the scenes before the RW
-Dany planning and taking Yunkai, with a battle scene where we see Jorah, Grey Worm and Daario fighting (Barristan will be left behind with Dany, apparently, hopefully telling her stuff about Rhaegar like in the book)
-Jon and the wildlings near Queenscrown, with a fight scene, apparently
-Bran & his gang in Queenscrown, with Bran warging Hodor
-Sam and Gilly meet Coldhands. They are not shown in the preview, but they appear in the recap, so they will probably be in the episode.
4372	Prince of Dragonstone	2013-05-20	I don't think the Siege of Meereen could constitute Dany's entire Season 4 story arc unless it ends were ASoS ends with Dany sitting in the Great Pyramid, looking down upon the conquered cityscape and proclaiming that before she can rule Westeros, she must first learn to be a Queen. 
As much as some fans love to lament the Meereen storyline, I think it is vital for Dany's overall character arc because how the HELL is Dany supposed to rule the Seven Kingdoms if she cannot first learn to rule a relatively small city-state? The disaster that becomes Astapor teaches her that she is still a naive girl and  that being a good conqueror doesn't mean being a good ruler. She had to have this administrative training, experiencing the daily, often mundane aspects of governance to be a good Queen. Robert failed at this. Cersei failed at this. Dany means to succeed where they could not.
4373	Queen of Whores	2013-05-21	King's Landing also wasn't present in 1x2, and Tyrion wasn't in 1x7. And guess what? They were still great episodes. Another episode with no KL or Tyrion will be refreshing. His only book scene left at this point is Tywin telling him about the RW, which will probably be towards the start of 3x10.
4374	Titan	2013-05-21	Yep, Mereen is essential. Dany has to face some real adversity - many non-readers are already seeing this season as Dany playing the game of thrones in "easy mode". Everything is going well for her, she needs to be brought down a peg at some point - before she reaches her next triumphant moment.
4375	Nobody of the canals	2013-05-21	Not sure, but the last shot zooming down on Jon looks like the eagle scratch...

Um, yes, that does happen.And to wonder if an episode of HBO's series Game of Thrones may have people removing their clothes for no reason ... well, that question answers itself.
4383	Dove	2013-05-21	hahahaha
In my experience it's pretty much a universal constant that the first thing a drunken jackass does is remove his shirt. It doesn't matter if it's hot or cold, rainy or dry, or whether it's a small gathering or there are a ton of people around. If he's drunk enough, that shirt's comin' off.
Anyone know if there's an imgur album for this trailer like there was the last couple? I don't particularly feel like plunging into reddit today.
4384	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-05-21	Dany and daario hand spooning, the shirtless men if theyre at the twins why would they take of their shirts? Do drunk ppl remove their shirts for no reason?Sadly I've paraded around drunk without a shirt before. So yeah it does happen.
4385	Titan	2013-05-21	Not sure, but the last shot zooming down on Jon looks like the eagle scratch...My speculation - Jon kills Orell in this episode, and Orell(as eagle) attacks him.
4386	The Key Is Patchface	2013-05-21	I get the feeling KL won't be in next episode. There's nothing from KL in the preview nor in the recap. It might be the first episode in the entire show we KL and Tyrion are not seen. So it looks like the episode will include only:-The Red Wedding, obviously, with some scenes of Robb planning his campaign to give false hope-Arya and the Hound arriving at the Twins, with some tension building between them in the scenes before the RW-Dany planning and taking Yunkai, with a battle scene where we see Jorah, Grey Worm and Daario fighting (Barristan will be left behind with Dany, apparently, hopefully telling her stuff about Rhaegar like in the book)-Jon and the wildlings near Queenscrown, with a fight scene, apparently-Bran & his gang in Queenscrown, with Bran warging Hodor-Sam and Gilly meet Coldhands. They are not shown in the preview, but they appear in the recap, so they will probably be in the episode.Bran will be warging Summer no?

4388	ebevan91	2013-05-21	Bran will be warging Summer no?He wargs both I think. Summer while helping Jon and Hodor to shut him up.
4389	ugashep	2013-05-21	From the trailer it looks like Meereen could be left out of the tv show all together.  Interesting. /eek.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':eek:' /> There is no evidence Meereen will be cut from the show, what the hell would they do with Dany for the next 2-3 seasons? They are likely just altering the battle of Yunkai to be able to show a smaller scale engagement, because they don't have the budget to shoot a huge CGI battle every time the books call for one.

4391	Nezzer	2013-05-21	He wargs both I think.Summer while helping Jon and Hodor to shut him up.Yes, both. In the synopsis it says "Bran discovers a new gift", so it's probably him learning how to warg humans.
4392	bobbybuilderton	2013-05-21	I put this in the discussion in the episode 9 thread too, but
I think they will show Balon dying and show Yara at the funeral or whatever. It could be a really short scene. Bannen's funeral was short, it would only need to be a little bit longer to show her saying she thinks her brother is dead and now her father is too. I think they will do this because it serves many purposes.
It reveals to the less attentive viewers that it's definitely not Balon holding Theon for messing up at Winterfell.
It starts the iron islands succession storyline a bit
It gets people worried that maybe Melisandre's curse was real.
But then they will show a short king's landing scene (remember, some scenes are not always previewed in the "last time" clips, especially if they're short) where Joffrey is alive and well. That will get the viewers fears to go away and say that "okay, it was just a freak accident/assassination."
So they will not know if Robb is safe or not. They also don't know if Melisandre really did curse them all or if it was just a magic trick. Which is totally in line with her character.
4393	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-05-21	I don't think we'll actually see Balon dying. Rather someone will mention that he "fell" off a bridge and then later we'll see the funeral.
Among many other reasons I can't see the benefit of casting him again and bringing him out to film a CG scene of being flung off a bridge when he dies off screen in the book anyways.

4394	bobbybuilderton	2013-05-21	I don't think we'll actually see Balon dying. Rather someone will mention that he "fell" off a bridge and then later we'll see the funeral.Yeah or that. I forgot to mention that maybe they will show her receiving a lil piece of skin from a certain Bastard and finally name him...I don't remember if that ever happens in the books or what, but it would work imo, to have him send a finger to Yara and skin to Robb. They could also just ignore it and move it to the season finale, so that people think Joffrey will die that episode. So many ways to do kick off the iron islands story.

It'd be awesome to have a scene of Balon falling off the bridge, shot from an ambiguous angle so we can't see if he tripped or if he was pushed, then some servants run to the bridge and look down, and one of them looks like Jaqen H'ghar with his second face. That would be great.

4408	Birdsong65	2013-05-22	At one point it looks like Robb is having a fight in the rain shirtless, I have no clue what that could be, I don't recall that in the book - - maybe it's just a random wrestling match at the wedding w/ drunk stark soldiers.uh-oh i'm having flashbacks to the Tudors hereRobb nooo you've made enough mistakes, don't start channeling Henry VIII nowI think it's Jon with the wildlings.
4409	protar	2013-05-22	Yes, both. In the synopsis it says "Bran discovers a new gift", so it's probably him learning how to warg humans.He hasn't learned to properly warg wolves yet, he can't consciously control them and can only warg them in his sleep. The conscious aspect of it will be his new gift imo.He wargs both I think.Summer while helping Jon and Hodor to shut him up.I think it more likely, that he'll warg Hodor in season 4 when he's beyond the Wall. That will create a nice progression of development. Season 2 - wolf dreams, Season 3 - conscious warging, Season 4 - warging other animals, warging humans.

4411	ebevan91	2013-05-22	You might be right about him warging into Hodor only in book 5. I remember him fighting off the Others but I could've sworn he warged into Hodor at Queenscrown to shut him up because he kept screaming HODOR HODOR HODOR.
4412	Clariana	2013-05-22	My speculation - Jon kills Orell in this episode, and Orell(as eagle) attacks him.Further speculation: which would open the way for the last scene of the ep which will be the dying Robb warging Grey Wind and Grey Wind being slaughtered...
4413	ShigellaSand	2013-05-22	He definitely warged Hodor at Queenscrown. Briefly, out of desperation, not sure it would work - but he did it.
4414	Q the Cat	2013-05-22	I just read that section last night.  Bran warged into Hodor by accident, trying to calm him when Hodor was freaking out about the lightning.
4415	Ravi Seaworth	2013-05-22	He definitely warged Hodor at Queenscrown. Briefly, out of desperation, not sure it would work - but he did it.He calmed Hodor down during the thunder storm, right when Ygritte and John were hearing noises from the castle.

4416	WiDMNDBAMMD	2013-05-22	The series will probably not last as long you two might imagine (see here). I don't think that means they will necessarily cut out Meereen but I am actually expecting them to speed up Daenerys' story significantly.That says a minimum of seven seasons. I think that producer proved his idiotness when he said that only SoS will be this season and next season. Has the guy read the books at all? Does he not see FFCs material and DwDs material next season?Bran's DwD material will be next season and Yara/Iron Island stuff will be from FFCs as well, plus some storylines might go past where they end in Storm of Swords.I don't think the Siege of Meereen could constitute Dany's entire Season 4 story arc unless it ends were ASoS ends with Dany sitting in the Great Pyramid, looking down upon the conquered cityscape and proclaiming that before she can rule Westeros, she must first learn to be a Queen.As much as some fans love to lament the Meereen storyline, I think it is vital for Dany's overall character arc because how the HELL is Dany supposed to rule the Seven Kingdoms if she cannot first learn to rule a relatively small city-state?Which is why Dany's storyline should go into DwD material. The Mereen storyline doesn't need to be slowed down. Part of next season should be her starting to learn to rule dealing while trying to juggle her love hexagon.The disaster that becomes Astapor teaches her that she is still a naive girl and  that being a good conqueror doesn't mean being a good ruler. She had to have this administrative training, experiencing the daily, often mundane aspects of governance to be a good Queen. Robert failed at this. Cersei failed at this. Dany means to succeed where they could not.Aegon failed at this, he let his sister wives rule. He was an excellent conqueror though. I don't know if there is any good soldier for the Targaryens that was a good ruler? Bloodraven maybe? He stopped the Blackfyre rebellion and did a decent job as Hand of the King.Which means that Renly's question of "do you still believe that good soldiers make good kings?" rings very true. Very few King's in this fake history did.My speculation - Jon kills Orell in this episode, and Orell(as eagle) attacks him.Which will answer the question that Jon asked him earlier in the series about "what happens to your eagle when I kill you?"Bran will be warging Summer no?Yes.Yes, both. In the synopsis it says "Bran discovers a new gift", so it's probably him learning how to warg humans.-Bran & his gang in Queenscrown, with Bran warging HodorI didn't think Bran warged Hodor until Book 5?  Could be wrong.You're wrong but it doesn't matter because we're talking about the show and not the books. In the books Bran meets Jojen in Clash of Kings, the second book which was covered in season two of Game of Thrones. In the show Bran didn't meet Jojen till season 3 as a result Bran's skill as a warg is a bit less at this point than it is in the books.Bran hasn't warged into Summer except in his dreams, so it's not only skipping a step in his warg learning process, it would be weird for him to warg into Hodor, since he needs to warg into Summer to save Jon, warging into Hodor doesn't help Jon escape 20 wildlings.
4417	Gendels Children	2013-05-23	I have a question, who is it the wildlings are battling in the preview, they aren't at CastleBlack, but Tormund says something that implies they are about to go into open battle with Nightswatchmen, so im really hoping they are not going to try merge the QueensCrown scene with the CastleBlack battle but have it on an open field /wacko.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':wacko:' />  . in other trailers we see the old man Jon is told to kill and it looks like Jon is pretty close to doing it.. 
hmm I don't know... all I can gather is there is a battle with possible NWmen, Jon leaves but not before (most likely) killing Orel, getting scratched in the face, and being confronted with Ygritte who will hopefully shoot him in the leg (sorry Jonny)
4418	The Dragon has three heads	2013-05-23	Possibly.  I did note that one of the three coins that the TItan's Bastard used to decide who should sneak into her camp and kill Dany was "from Meereen".  Plus we had a reference earlier in the series to "a Meereenese knot".  So the place does exist in the TV version of Essos.  Whether we see it or not, probbably have to wait until season 4.Agree it's been mentioned too much not to play a role, and will probably be her mid season-ep 4 or so conquest after they Try to assassinate her again, murder slave children and perhaps try to kill her dragons too.Then the audience will be lathered for her to storm the city.

They probably made him to be a man of the NW, maybe in order to magnify the inner conflict of John that, in part, leads him to abandon the group and head towards Castle Black. Also, having Tormund ordering the death of an ordinary defenseless old man may be too cruel and give a bad image of a character that ultimately should be likeable. In the books, I think the reason that justified the killing attempt was that the old man could give away their presence. In the show, they may be providing the extra motivation that he his an enemy in the ongoing war between the wildlings and the NW.

Then, we see the group running (apparently, without John), and later John protecting himself from something coming from the sky. Someone already pointed out that the last scene is possibly John being attacked by an eagle. So, it seems that John prevents Ygritte from killing someone, then he runs, the others go after him, and Orell wargs into an eagle and attacks him.

I know there are other trailer that give off the same battle impression, I cant be bothered looking for all of them right now but I know one is in the second trailer for season 3 to be released, I will see if I can link it so you don't need to go hunting around the web for it if you want to see.EDIT: I do agree about Orel and the wildlings chasing Jon, but I think more happens before that happens.ok its about 1:02 in http://www.youtube.c...h?v=p4iljcuzjG8very similar scene, but not raining, wildlings running and Ygritte drawing her bow. this tell me there is a battle, not just the killing of one old man

It is just fun to try to guess what is going to happen.Now that you show that trailer, what I was saying is not so obvious. That charge of wildlings seems something completely different.I agree, I just wanted to point out since its difficult to convey tone through text. also Im happy to have other peoples opinion on what will happen, your right its fun, and since we have to wait an extra week before finding out what happens I've become transfixed on the possibilities. I kind of want to get all the preview shots from this scene and try to place them together in a sort of time line judging by the rain to see exactly how it will play out, but that would take more time then I have, it would be fun though. just looking forward to the QueensCrown scene so bad it was one of the best moments for me reading the books, knowing they were so close,  Bran doing his thing and helping save Jon, such a awesome moment for the Stark children, I hope they don't stray too far from the book with it, but if they do I hope they make it even better
4425	protar	2013-05-23	You might be right about him warging into Hodor only in book 5. I remember him fighting off the Others but I could've sworn he warged into Hodor at Queenscrown to shut him up because he kept screaming HODOR HODOR HODOR.He does briefly warg Hodor in Queenscrown. But I think they'll remove that and have him warg Hodor for the first time in S4 to create a more natural progression of his powers. We'll see next episode I guess.
4426	Tone	2013-05-23	Could be Summer that Ygritte is about to shoot when Jon rams her.

4428	Kasrith	2013-05-23	-Bran & his gang in Queenscrown, with Bran warging HodorIIRC, in the book no one knew he slipped into Hodor. In order to play on his developing warg abilities and Jojen's training (ala "that's how it is in the beginning, before you learn how to control it") I think he's going to warg Summer and have him fight side by side with Jon. Would make for much better tv than Hodor stumbling around the tower.Plus, he can still warg into Hodor at the Nightfort
					
					
							Edited by Kasrith, 23 May 2013 - 08:46 PM.
4429	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-05-23	It's almost certainly his ability to actually "be" Summer while awake for the first time, and quite frankly I can't fucking wait.
4430	Kasrith	2013-05-23	Not sure, but the last shot zooming down on Jon looks like the eagle scratch...It's funny cause Arya's the one threatening to remove eyes in the first seconds of the trailerYes, both. In the synopsis it says "Bran discovers a new gift", so it's probably him learning how to warg humans.Technically he still hasn't 'warged' the wolf in the show yet, only dream of it. So that's still considered a 'new gift', he won't jump to human warging until he nails wolf warging first.

4433	Kasrith	2013-05-23	It's almost certainly his ability to actually "be" Summer while awake for the first time, and quite frankly I can't fucking wait.I hope we get a first person Summer POV...Alsothis is a ep9 trailer content thread and no one mentions this cause they're too busy with wildlings and weddings /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />https://twitter.com/...759853630091265

4435	Kasrith	2013-05-24	I don't understand?I think it's interesting that the one lion piece in the center of it all is a darker colour than the rest of them. Perhaps signifying Tyrion's physical differences, or foreshadowing a certain action
4436	Gendels Children	2013-05-25	Could be Summer that Ygritte is about to shoot when Jon rams her.oh man that would be good, cant wait to see some awesome Direwolf action... finally....
4437	LordStoneheart	2013-05-31	I think it's interesting that the one lion piece in the center of it all is a darker colour than the rest of them. Perhaps signifying Tyrion's physical differences, or foreshadowing a certain actionOr possibly Roose?
4438	siknes	2013-05-31	At one point it looks like Robb is having a fight in the rain shirtless, I have no clue what that could be, I don't recall that in the book - - maybe it's just a random wrestling match at the wedding w/ drunk stark soldiers.It could be an illusion to the fact all the Stark's can warg, especially just before death.
4439	Clariana	2013-05-31	I think it's interesting that the one lion piece in the center of it all is a darker colour than the rest of them. Perhaps signifying Tyrion's physical differences, or foreshadowing a certain actionOr a certain undercover Lannister spy...
4440	Kasrith	2013-05-31	Or a certain undercover Lannister spy...Ah yes this is soon to be determined.I just figured - since it's a lion piece - that externally (that is to say to the world) it would look like a lannister, but in fact it's not really crimson. Both Roose and a possible spy other than Roose would be the opposite; a different coloured wolf piece perhaps.
4441	Clariana	2013-05-31	"A cat of a different coat", perhaps?
4442	Phthalo Snow	2013-06-02	I am surprised no one has thought that Bran discovering a "new gift", is him and his band being on the New Gift as well as consciously warging?
4443	ugashep	2013-05-16	Does anybody think that Roose will give Catelyn a piece of Theon's skin before the Red Wedding as he does in the book? It could be a way to lull she and Robb further into his trust, as if Robb is noticing anyone but Talisa at this point. Roose could also maybe along the same lines tell them his bastard has captured Theon and learned that two common boys were burned and posed as Bran and Rickon. This would give them false hope and also potentially increase their faith, trust, and gratitude towards Bolton. Since they are going to die anyway it does not matter what he tells them as far as others knowing. I don't necessarily believe this, I just thought about it earlier. Considering how screwy the whole Bran and Rickon news has been to Robb and Catelyn on the show who knows, I wanted to see what everybody else thought.
4444	Fredwin	2013-05-19	It's totally plausible. I would like to see this happen.

Theon only confessed to Ramsay that he burned to butcher boys, and I seriously doubt that Ramsay would tell anyone about that.  Ramsay has every reason to wish that everyone thinks that the Stark boys are dead.

Ramsay has every reason to wish that everyone thinks that the Stark boys are dead. I agree Roose and Ramsay both want everyone to believe the Stark boys are dead, I don't know that Ramsay would keep it from Roose, Ramsay is constantly trying to prove himself to Roose and I giving his dad that key bit of intel would be one way of trying to do it. As far as Roose is concerned, why not tell Robb and Cat, they'll love and trust you for it, and they're dead anyway. I'm not saying it will happen it just would make sense show wise and I wonder if that's what they'll do.
4449	BananaSpice	2013-05-19	I don't care what he says, but I want the skin to be given and for Robb to be grossed out / angry about it!!

4451	TheAwesomeVargoHoat	2013-05-19	Considering Cat isn't really dead, she can't know Bran and Rickon are alive.
4452	ugashep	2013-05-19	Considering Cat isn't really dead, she can't know Bran and Rickon are alive. Good point, it is more likely he will tell them Bran & Rickon are dead, actually it is most likely they won't deal with it at all.
4453	Mav Of The Canals	2013-05-19	We don't know if she is there for the wedding yet. Robb may send her off before the festivities.In one of the trailers for Season 3, there was a quick shot of Robb, Cat, and Talissa at the Twins.
4454	Angmar	2013-05-20	It would be good, but not exactly neccesary.I do like that passage in the book where Catelyn desires to hold the piece to her chest. so would i, hah.  though

4455	Pinkie Baelish	2013-05-20	I'm not so sure. If Ramsay's identity is revealed offscreen by Roose, Theon's whole arc would seem like a waste of time. I would prefer if Ramsay's identity and the reveal of who burned Winterfell come just before the massacre. And I don't know about Cat knowing that Bran and Rickon weren't killed by Theon. The reason why she goes insane after Robb's death is because she believes all her children, except Sansa, who's now married to the Lannisters, to be dead.
4456	Asshai by the Shadow	2013-05-20	We won't have a Ramsay reveal in episode 9 because he's not in the 'Previously on episode # 8' recap. If he is revealed, it will be by Roose givng Theon's skin to Cat and Robb. If not, it will 100% be in episode 10 i have no doubt
4457	Stannis the Menace	2013-05-20	I agree Roose and Ramsay both want everyone to believe the Stark boys are dead, I don't know that Ramsay would keep it from Roose, Ramsay is constantly trying to prove himself to Roose and I giving his dad that key bit of intel would be one way of trying to do it.

I'm not saying it will happen it just would make sense show wise and I wonder if that's what they'll do.Well, if they are trying to keep it as close to the book as possible, then telling that bran adn rickon were still alive would change her dynamic when the shit hits the fan.  If she knew that she still had two other sons left, i doubt she would throw her life away like she does, because IIRC they werent planning on killing Cat, just take her hostage.  If she knows she still has 2 sons left then mayb she cuts her losses and goes quietly with the hope of seeing her other children again.
4458	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-21	I'd like them too. It's creepy and gothic as fuck.
4459	Mark Antony	2013-05-21	Yess i hope so i love that scene in the books. Fuckin Roose.

4463	SynthFG	2013-05-22	No
I think Roose will turn up having lost 1/2 his army at the trident, with Theons finger skin and the news the boys are dead,
this will prompt Rob to name JS heir and send Mormont and Glover (extras) off to Seaguard / Greywater
We then get the build up to the wedding wrapped around the story line of JS and Bran crossing at Queenscrown, Danny faffing around outside the city and possibly Loros opting for the Kinsguard over a lifetime married to Cerci
We should also get Coldhands meeting Sam, leaving Sam and Gilly coming out of the Well as Brans closer for the season in 10

4464	Ravi Seaworth	2013-05-22	I guess telling that Bran and Rickon are alive would work as well, but the way it is done in the books seems to have a stronger emotional impact. At least, when I was reading it, it broke my heart to put myself in the position of Catelyn before she was killed: knowing that every single person of your family was either killed or harmed. It made me pity the Starks.
4465	SeanF	2013-05-22	Perhaps Roose will hand over Theon's "most precious part" to Robb and Catelyn.

4467	Red Knight	2013-05-22	i loved "the piece of prince" line in the books, i hope we'll see it in the show
4468	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-22	It's so gruesome /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' /> Befitting Roose
4469	Kyoti	2013-05-22	They have to at least tell Cat and Robb that Bran and Rickon are dead. It should be in a pink wax sealed letter with a piece of prince in it, but if they let Robb and Cat die thinking the boys are still alive would kill the impact. Plus a huge part of the RW in the book was knowing as the reader that they were walking into a trap. You didn't know how big or what would happen, but you knew they were hosed walking in the door. The show has to let the audience know that something is terribly, terribly wrong before they walk in the door or D&D will have wasted a huge opportunity.
4470	Bannerless Man	2013-05-22	Perhaps Roose will hand over Theon's "most precious part" to Robb and Catelyn. /ack.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':ack:' /> I do hope not. A piece of flayed skin would surely be enough. That and it would hardly be polite, to do so in the company of a female.
4471	The Killer Snark	2013-05-22	I have a nasty feeling he'll present the Starks with his severed penis. His missing finger was not particularly well flayed.
4472	lostinwesteros	2013-05-22	I completely missed that Roose gave Cat a piece of Theon's skin before the wedding.  But I'm not sure why Roose would try to lull Cat and Robb into a false confidence, as Roose sat beside Cat during the wedding, saying barely a work and just picking at his food - not exactly trying to disarm her.
4473	SeanF	2013-05-23	/ack.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':ack:' /> I do hope not. A piece of flayed skin would surely be enough. That and it would hardly be polite, to do so in the company of a female.The Northmen have different traditions.  They only gave up human sacrifice fairly recently.Giving a lady the severed body part of an enemy is probably considered good manners.
4474	WatcherontheRock	2013-05-23	I hope he will. This is who Roose is. He doesn't have much screentime, it's time to give him more flesh (pun intended).

4488	Caryn Stark	2013-05-31	Doesn't his sister get his man parts? 
I hope Cat gets a piece of theon's finger, and ditto on the don't give it to Talisa, please. In fact, don't give any more lines to Talisa ever.
4489	Mammothsbane	2013-06-01	I still don't understand the reason for keeping Ramsay a secret. Anyone who remembers season 2 knows that Roose's bastard went to Winterfell to capture theon and anyone who doesn't remember probably won't care. It's going to be a fail scene if he is just like "lol btw I'm Ramsay"I do hope they keep most of the Red Wedding as close as possible, including the piece of prince. Catelyn needs to know Bran/Rickon are dead in order to go completely batshit. At this point, Robb was just murdered in front of her, Bran and Rickon are dead, Arya has been MIA for months, and Sansa just married Tyrion. She's lost it all, and it needs to be the same on-screen to have the same effect.Doesn't his sister get his man parts?I hope Cat gets a piece of theon's finger, and ditto on the don't give it to Talisa, please. In fact, don't give any more lines to Talisa ever.I like the "no more lines for Talisa" idea. D&D should run with that.
4490	LordStoneheart	2013-05-16	The White Walkers look a bit different than in the books. They're not exactly "inhumanely beautiful" to paraphrase something George said, at least I wouldn't date a girl with the same kind of skin as the WW we see at the end of S2.When Sam turns into the Slayer this Sunday do you think we will see the White Walker melt into water ala Wicked Witch?I feel like this is a detail that should stay the same but for adaption purposes could change into something else. Like he crumbles into dust bits or explodes into snow. giggity

4500	Winterz	2013-05-19	Well honestly I wished the battle lasted longer. It was basically just Sam attacks, Puddles Shards pushes him away, Sam attacks with the obsidian and Shard's a goner and Sam's the Slayer. The end.

4502	Queen Elsa	2013-05-19	have to agree, my non book reader friend was like "how come he didn't get the dagger"Yeah, and dragonglass is rare nowadays. How can Sam defend himself, Gilly, and the baby now that his sword is no more and the dragonglass left behind? Maybe he got two swords and a hidden dagger. Or, he'll find one along the way. Can't believe I'm answering my own question. /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
4503	Mason	2013-05-19	Crackles came to mind for me.
I only just recently got around to reading the Dunk and Egg stories and learning more about Bloodraven so I was extra giddy with the ravens XD
4504	Florina Laufeyson	2013-05-19	There was a Dunk and Egg reference in those scenes. On the list of boys' names, one is Duncan. Awww.
The weirwood with the ravens was amazing and i loved that so much. My mum was all "that doesnt bode well." but i was like "Not quite in this mythos." While ravens are the bearers of bad news, they arent exactly bad news themselves. Plus its clear they were there to warn Sam. I feel a bit of Coldhands and Bloodraven coming on. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
Shards is great. While im a little sad he didnt melt like Puddles, the fight and the effects rocked. 
I think the obsidian dagger may magically teleport back into Sam's inventory. lol!

4507	ChromeWeasel	2013-05-20	I know, I was like "Sam, why do you have to fuck up every time..."I thought the same thing. But it is in character. It's a miracle he had the gumption to actually attack the beast in the first place. Remembering to take the obsidian would just be too big a leap.
4508	Esa1996	2013-05-20	I was actually pretty disappointed with the scene. Would have been better to have Shards grab his own sword and knock Sams sword out of his hand etc. Didn't like how Sam's sword exploded, would have been better for it to just crumble to pieces. Also, the Others aren't meant to be super powered! He threw Sam many meters with one hand and Sam's not too light y'know.
4509	The_Gallows_Knight	2013-05-20	I can't belive they didn't manage to capture the spirit of Puddles. Total character assassination.
4510	lostinwesteros	2013-05-20	I really liked the way this scene was handled, especially the inclusion of what seemed like hundreds of ravens.  I really liked seeing dragonglass at work but just wish someone could have witnessed it (not that Gilly isn't someone, but I'm not sure she'd be considered a reliable source back at the Wall).  And, as I've protested in other threads about this episode........why did Sam leave the dragonglass blade behind?  I wanted to yell, "Don't you think you might need that again?", but of course, he doesn't connect the dragonglass with his ability to slay the Other.
4511	juanml82	2013-05-20	I wonder how Shards, or his fellow brothers in arms, were able to attack the Fist of the First Men. In the books I got the impression the WW were agile and terrifying, beautiful, opponents. Shards, however, moves like he's Grandpa White Walker. He probably wouldn't be able to climb to the top of the Fist, let alone under enemy fire and even less pursue the retreating brothers of the Night's Watch. He's so slow jogging away from him is enough to get away.
And that way, the Long Night makes little sense. What's the big deal in fighting Grandpa White Walker? Have a bunch of archers fire obsidian or fire arrows at the incoming Grandpas, if they miss, retreat, fire again, retreat, rinse and repeat until they are all dead. Grandpa Others just can't keep up with humans.

4512	Ser Milady Wolf	2013-05-20	I can't belive they didn't manage to capture the spirit of Puddles. Total character assassination.haha.
4513	LordStoneheart	2013-05-20	Wow I called it completely. When he exploded I was like "he's not puddles!" but then I remembered I did this post a few days ago and laughed.
I thought his super powers were great. Sword-shattering cold touch and an awesome Roadhouse kick.
Edit: just rewatched. It wasn't a kick, it was like an icy bitch slap.

4514	KSims1868	2013-05-20	I loved this scene also.  I think they are really capturing the white walkers in the HBO adaptation.  Okay...not the beautiful part, but dang if they aren't awesome anyways!!!
Agreed about Sam not picking the dragon glass dagger back up.  Lame.

Grandpa Others just can't keep up with humans.That WW was walking like a confident bastard who saw, once again, no threat in Sam as a warrior (depending on if you think he saw him in the finale last season).  The way in which he tossed fat ass Sam 30 feet tells me you do not want to be fighting these guys if they are in assault mode.  Remember, in the pilot the WW (though different design) were stalking the ranger through the woods at a full on sprint and surrounding him.  I still think the scene from last season should have ended in the brothers all around the fires at the fist, Sam turns around and you see one set of blue eyes staring out from the pitch black.  Then one more set opens, then thousands.  Then a bum rush of walkers and wights.  15 seconds of friggin mayhem then blackout.I think what I always took from the long night is the WWs aren't affected by the weather or terrain so they can stalk at their pleasure and pick off the brothers as they succomb to fatigue and cold.  It's something I was immensely dissatisfied with the shows depiction because you don't really get a sense for just how doomed these guys are.  Oh well.
4516	King of Winters	2013-05-20	Shards must be cousin or something of Puddles.
4517	Vovea	2013-05-20	What is made of water may never cry. Do not weep for this fallen hero. If they had the white walker slop onto the floor like a water balloon, I'd be laughing even more than I was while watching Gilley stand there screaming.
4518	The_Gallows_Knight	2013-05-20	Shards must be cousin or something of Puddles. I wonder why they felt the need to invent a new character when the old one ould have fit just as well. How tv-show typical.

4520	Mother of Mini Dragons	2013-05-20	This scene was amazing! The ravens were a great touch and creepy, I was crawling up my seat watching and trying not to watch while watching.
I watched the interview of the guy who played this WW, the make up is so amazing and he super creepy.
4521	SilentSense	2013-05-20	I almost stopped watching when Sam just left the dagger there. Maddening.

4524	Buckwheat	2013-05-20	I liked the scene too, apart from Sam leaving the blade there. The inclusion of the ravens was great, it built up the suspence.Great scene. Is Shards supposed to be the same Other that Sam saw at the end of season 2? Or do they all just look the same?I think all the Others just look the same.

4527	RottenAppleFossoway	2013-05-20	Shards is a perfect name for the show adaptation of the character affectionately known as Puddles around here. Kudos!
The ravens going nuts outside while Sam and Gilly were inside was fantastic. I liked everything about the scene except that only Sam, Gilly and the ravens saw it. No Sam the Slayer? Bah!
 I'm still hopeful we get Coldhands before seasons end but its looking less likely to me. That's unfortunate in my opinion. He's an interesting character in the books.

Plenty of people were scared. I was not, because I knew what was going to happen. As for the dagger, they clearly introduced it two episodes ago. An explicit reference to its nature and ability to kill WW wouldn't feel natural, since Sam does not know that and in the middle of the chaos an instinctive reaction is either to panic or to attack the creature as he did.

But I cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation that may be found in the thanks of the Non-Genocidal Prejudice Free Dominion they died to save.																																																														  I have on many occasions had the great honor to take direction from your dearly departed husband and brother in many great battles for our noble cause and have under their direction and guidance seen hundreds of former enemies, hornfoot men, nightswatchmen, giants, and cave people come to know the unifying and peace giving qualities of a pair of bright blue eyes.  A pair of eyes given to them by your blessed departed, we shall never see their like again. 																																																											I pray now only that our Great Other may assuage the anguish of your bereavement, and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved, lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of reanimation of the unified utilitarian dead .Yours, very sincerely and respectfully, The Undead Abraham Lincoln, Chief Wight of the Army of Thralls of the Great Other, 404 Dry Ice Lane, Valley of Thenn.

When I referred to the practice of our aesthetically pleasing challenged brethren beyond the wall, of liberating male infants born into the pestilence of Craster's Keep as "stealing" I only meant to express the great haste with which the noble white walkers of the haunted forest secret the babes away from the unfortunate circumstances of their birth.  Their lives as reanimated thralls of equal statute, regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, religious denomination, or sexual orientation are certainly preferable to any life these children may have had amongst the socially and economically stratified kingdoms of men, be it north or south of the wall. In penance for my carelessness I swear to wear a blue ribbon on my shirt on the night of the next Academy Award show to symbolize my solidarity with our icy friends. Humbly I remain, Ugashep, lowly Ice and Fire Forum Commenter."

4562	mediterraneo	2013-05-22	I agree with the ones that say that the poor Shard wasn't exactly attacking Sam, as the book one didn't consider him a menace in front of the other two Watchmen, when he found him, and Gren, and the third.
Despite the irony here, I LOVED the White Walker's behaviour with Sam, demonstrating superiority and not killing him outright.
I don't believe he is just stupid, he just didn't mean to kill Sam, just to get the poor child.
Sam is a sworn brother of the Watch, who, as Jon did and as no other classmates of theirs did, swore to the trees, north of the Wall. And the one fighting with him was a White Walker, one of the armed (he had a spear on last season's end, riding his dead beast) like the ones that killed Ser Waymar Royce. Not a zombie like the dead watchemen attacking Mormont in his room. And his use of force against Sam had quite evident non-lethal results, even if his intentions could be debated.
In any case, there are people there in the Heresy threads who looked this scene and find in it fuel. The child of Craster's is somehow related to the Pact that ended the Long Night in the same way that the Watch ("if it stays true") is. And White Walkers are agents of the Gods, not of any "Great Other" nobody in the North has spoken of, just the woman from Asshai.
There is complexity in this part of the story, not just monodimensional "end game" monsters motivating all of the "good" guys of this story to rally to fight before the happy end of the tale.
And to understand this part, one should start asking him/herself questions.
This scene leaves one: why didn't Shard kill Sam fast, as he was clearly able to do with his "superpowers"?
Breaking Sam's neck wouldn't have taken more time than tossing him away (expecially if Shard hadn't left his spear somewhere before coming here) and it would have made grow his undead army.
Why didn't he?
Stupidity and arrogance? Simply a plot armor case? Or.....?
4563	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-22	I think it was arrogance, like ''I'll deal with you later'' LOL
4564	King of Winters	2013-05-22	The thing I don't get is why they took out the smoke from the torch when it gets put out and Sam crying from the books, as that makes it pretty clear Puddles was reborn in that moment as he is reborn in salt and smoke and will rise again to lead his fellow Others against the NW as he's AAR/TPTWP.

Ice and Fire are both elemental forces of destruction, while the COtF & the Weirwoods represent Life and the Earth.  Nan's intimation that the only thing that stopped the Others was the COtF seems to put them in opposition, and we all know Old Nan is right about everything. I just think the WW giving Sam a pass because he said his words in front of the heart tree is far-fetched.  More likely, Shards just saw Sam as totally irrelevant.

Who knows who Craster is talking about when he references "Gods", more than likely I think he is simply referring to the Others, that's the impression I got though granted my impression of the show is informed by the books. Yeah the Other came at Sam in this last episode near the weirwood and the raven, etc. but that could easily be interpreted as the Ravens warning of the Other's approach not an alliance between the two, considering aDwD indicates the ravens are not allied with the Others I lean against thinking there is no friendly connection between the Others and the old gods/ravens/weirwoods on the show, probably quite the opposite, I can see how certain things in the show so far could be misconstrued though.

Who knows who Craster is talking about when he references "Gods", more than likely I think he is simply referring to the Others, that's the impression I got though granted my impression of the show is informed by the books.I agree. The Others are the only Gods Craster keeps because they are real- he can see their power directly and they keep him safe.  Kind of like the Lord of Light, there's no leap of faith because "his" power is obvious. My only quibble with Shards is the loincloth. Puddles had armor, so you kind of get the idea there is some kind of Others culture or craft/art.  Half-naked Shards looks kind of Stone-Age. I mean if your skin is hard and impervious to cold I guess why bother with clothes, but then why the loincloth? And was it made of ice, too?
4581	Jslay427	2013-05-25	RIP puddles, you shall be missed. And to the person who said it was racist to say all the WW looked alike, I split my coffee out because of you:p
4582	Zorpack	2013-05-30	I was actually pretty disappointed with the scene. Would have been better to have Shards grab his own sword and knock Sams sword out of his hand etc. Didn't like how Sam's sword exploded, would have been better for it to just crumble to pieces. Also, the Others aren't meant to be super powered! He threw Sam many meters with one hand and Sam's not too light y'know.what? did u read the books?

4585	Esa1996	2013-05-31	what? did u read the books?Yes, I did.Ser Waymar's sword didn't explode to dust, it shattered and he got a shard of it in his eye. Other's aren't any stronger than humans judging by what we've seen so far in the books. Also, in the book, Puddles really had his sword out when Sam killed him.
4586	teemo	2013-05-19	Will it be cut considering there were no witnesses besides Gilly?  They could easily be lying and I doubt anyone would believe them anyway.  Do you think his nickname is cut or will his brothers believe the story?
4587	victim	2013-05-20	Have you ever told a story that is so ridiculous that nobody believes it? When you keep insisting that it's true, people start to mock you. 'Sam the Slayer' is just a nickname that people use to tease and belittle, not entirely unlike Lord Snow. It's not like many people believed it in the first place, whether Grenn is there or not hardly matters.

4589	JonCon's Red Beard	2013-05-20	Have you ever told a story that is so ridiculous that nobody believes it? When you keep insisting that it's true, people start to mock you. 'Sam the Slayer' is just a nickname that people use to tease and belittle, not entirely unlike Lord Snow. It's not like many people believed it in the first place, whether Grenn is there or not hardly matters.Exactly, they had witnesses in the book and yet, people didn't completely believe it. This could be the same: some might believe it, some others won't. Those who are nice to him might.
4590	JMJ	2013-05-20	He left the dragonglass knife with Puddles...
4591	Young Nan	2013-05-20	He left the dragonglass knife with Puddles...or should we call him "shards"
4592	PG_Tips	2013-05-20	Sam needs to tell them as it's important, So he will tell people and some won't believe him and call him Sam the Slayer to mock him. But Jon will believe and that's all that matters as he'll be the Lord Commander. 
I don't think it'll be out but I guess we'll have to wait and see.
4593	The Knight of Flours	2013-05-20	There at least has to be one mention of 'Sam the Slayer' on the show (though I'm sure it will be to mock Sam).  It is known.
4594	kephv	2013-05-20	I'm sure Gilly will mention it to one of the black brothers back at Castle Black and the name will take hold there.
4595	JMJ	2013-05-20	That Other did look like the same one who made eye contact with Sam at the end of S2 (the one on horseback). If so, then why did he leave Sam alone the first time around and come after Sam, Gilly and the baby this time? Was Gilly's son what he was after, ala Craster's sacrifices? He clearly did not intend to kill Sam either time, as he merely shattered Sam's sword and flung him aside.
4596	amilas	2013-05-20	I think they might go the way victim is proposing, where they will probably mock Sam when he tells them the story later. That being said, it will probably be one throw-away line meant for the readers and then they will move onto how obsidian kills the Others. Too bad too. "Sam the Slayer" is a great turning point in Sam's character.
4597	Envie	2013-05-20	If I remember correctly from the books, not very many people took the story seriously even though there were witnesses who saw Sam do it and he was mocked with the title anyways. In this case, Gilly is the only witness and people won't take her seriously either but they'll still mock Sam with the title and that still works I guess. 
I'm also one of those obsessed with the fact they ran off and he left the damn dragonglass laying there in the snow!! /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />
4598	Greywolf2375	2013-05-20	One of the things that made the Sam the Slayer nickname even more of a mockery was the fact that he just stabbed blindly at the Other and happened to connect.
Yes, many did mock him for the act since they didn't believe it but having the discussion between Grenn and Sam when Sam asked to not be called that I thought was kinda important for both of their characters.
Leaving the dagger behind is just another way of having it get destroyed without him having to fight another one and have it shatter.  it also might lend to the "I left it there.  And more back at the...." if they do want to go in the direction of having found a cache of them that are no longer available.
4599	Nymeria's pup	2013-05-20	I was yelling at him to go back and pick up the dagger. I think that perhaps Coldhands will pick it up and return it to Sam when they meet.
4600	nirolo	2013-05-20	I was yelling at him to go back and pick up the dagger. I think that perhaps Coldhands will pick it up and return it to Sam when they meet.Seriously!How on earth is Sam supposed to be the Slayer if he doesn't even have the freaking dagger he used for the slaying?Ridiculous. Just ridiculous.
4601	Lord Paolo Stark	2013-05-20	he could have the dagger if Coldhands returns it to him, maybe Coldhands is close and will teach him the importance of Dragon glass

							Edited by lightbringer333, 20 May 2013 - 11:28 AM.
4604	Joyful Union	2013-05-20	The important thing is that Jon believes Sam, and tries to get hold of Dragonglass later on. "Slayer" was always a mocking nickname for most I got the impression, so it can still take root that way.
4605	Queen Elsa	2013-05-20	He left the dragonglass knife with Puddles...Such a rare thing got left behind. Hopefully Edd and Grenn will find it.
4606	Warhawk137	2013-05-20	Speaking of Grenn... it's been a while since he's been in an episode.  I miss him.
4607	jmk51	2013-05-20	Didn't they find a bunch of them at the fist of the first men?  Probably not a big deal he dropped it. 
I'm guessing they leave the nickname in mockingly, but it still shouldn't impact the overall story.  They figured out how to kill the others, Sam found some courage.... not sure what else is missing?
4608	Dove	2013-05-20	They'll find a way to work it in if it needs to be. Sam's always been super honest about his cowardice and Gilly doesn't have any reason to lie, have Grenn/Edd trust Sam, boom, Slayer.
For me the most important part of the thing is Sam finding his courage, not the nickname. His most notable action in the Night's Watch (turning the tides of the poll for the LC election) doesn't really require him to have the clout of the Slayer nickname because it involved cleverness and manipulation anyway.
4609	victim	2013-05-20	Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't the dragonglass melt with the Other when he slays it in the books, or did I misread that?
4610	WiDMNDBAMMD	2013-05-20	Will it be cut considering there were no witnesses besides Gilly?  They could easily be lying and I doubt anyone would believe them anyway.  Do you think his nickname is cut or will his brothers believe the story?Sam will find books very very very old books that back up his story, the witness isn't really necessary.I always thought it was a mocking kinda title. Like Tyrion's the "Giant of the Lannisters"Sam did slay an other but he's more craven than Gilly most of the rest of the time.
4611	Dubbs	2013-05-20	I really don't like how they did that. Sam is supposed to be way too smart to just drop something he just realized is so valuable. And no witnesses is probably going to lead to even more mocking and disbelief than in the books.
4612	wolverine	2013-05-20	Didn't they find a bunch of them at the fist of the first men?  Probably not a big deal he dropped it.I'm guessing they leave the nickname in mockingly, but it still shouldn't impact the overall story.  They figured out how to kill the others, Sam found some courage.... not sure what else is missing?Yea they found a cache of daggers, spearheads, and arrow points from obsidian.  I don't know if they showed this on the show.Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't the dragonglass melt with the Other when he slays it in the books, or did I misread that?Just went back and looked but, no the dagger does not melt.  The Other basically melts away until all that is left is the intact dagger.  He actually breaks it against Small Pauls armor when he tries to use it on his wight.
4613	dttljs123	2013-05-20	I doubt he'll get the nickname now. Also i noticed the dagger didn't disappear when he stabbed Puddles, he just left it in the woods. Stupid SLAYER
4614	Cas Stark	2013-05-20	I thought it was strange also, he finally finds something that can kill the Others and oops, back to being a craven again, and I'll just leave that dragonglass dagger that saved my life on the ground while I run away.
4615	Mulled Wino	2013-05-20	Yea they found a cache of daggers, spearheads, and arrow points from obsidian.  I don't know if they showed this on the show.Just went back and looked but, no the dagger does not melt.  The Other basically melts away until all that is left is the intact dagger.  He actually breaks it against Small Pauls armor when he tries to use it on his wight.they didnt save much of the dragonglass
4616	Nobody of the canals	2013-05-21	I think they could have spent 5 more seconds on the scene to make it clearer that the dagger was the obsidian one that they were talking about earlier. It was already quite dark and the dagger didn't look very remarkable. And yeah, it was weird he left it there next to Puddles.
I might be in the minority here, maybe it is just the fact that I already knew what was going to happen, but I didn't think the scene was scary enough. I found the Other too thuggish /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />, you know, instead of eerily graceful.
4617	callmedodge	2013-05-21	Yeah, because people always think rationally when faced with death. They`re both probably in terrible amounts of shock. Be fucking reasonable guys, dropping and leaving the dagger is what 90% of people would do in that situation.

In fact they both gave out about him leaving the "magic dagger" behind.
4619	Khal Porno	2013-05-21	Jon, Maester Aemon, Grenn, Pyp, and Edd will believe Sam and Gilly's story.    His friends will probably call him that as a term of endearment, but the rest of the Night's Watch will probably call him that to mock him because they don't believe him.  I'm pretty sure there are brothers in the books who don't believe Sam killed the Other either.
I don't understand the problem.

And no witnesses is probably going to lead to even more mocking and disbelief than in the books.Ah, pretty sure he forgets the dagger in the book as well. It's Grenn, I think, that picks it up.And it totally is in his character. Just because he's book-learned doesn't mean he's a genius - he's a klutz. A big, lovable klutz.
4621	Versiroth	2013-05-21	In the book, Sam give the dagger to Grenn after killing the other.  For the show, the next scene with Sam will likely be of Cold Hands finding them, so, it's not like he really needs the dagger anymore anyway.   Plus, this scene added to the fact that Sam is a Brave craven of sorts.   When faced with the Other hurting Gilley, he was brave enough to attempt to fight it.. but, as soon as it fell, he lost all though and ran like the wind.   I loved it.

He showed the one dagger to Gilly a few episodes earlier, that's it. Besides, soon he is to break the dagger on the Wight of Small Paul, which demonstrates that the dragonglass daggers are otherwise quite delicate. They may be cutting that part out.
4624	silentwanderer	2013-05-21	Speaking of Grenn... it's been a while since he's been in an episode.

4635	jugdesh258	2013-05-22	well  we don't know much of the wights from the book to say they only want craster's babe.  They are unique and mystical so maybe they need the male babes in general just to create more of themselves ...i'd reckon.
Losing the knife is an equalizing mechanism since we might not see Sam break his knife in small paul being that they combined the slayer scene with the coldhands intro (missing) scene.  It is not as if there is any evidence that Sam need;s the blade any time soon in the story where he is headed
Part of Sam's quest to oldtown to become a maester is to find out where to get more dragonglass

4646	Delmas	2013-05-23	Sam the Slayer will be used in the show, likely in a mocking manor.  Me thinks
4647	Knight of Dubious Honor	2013-05-23	I think the intention of Weiss and Benioff for making changes in this scene, was to finally let Sam prove himself before the viewers. This scene wasn't about "How Sam became the Slayer", it was about showing his care for Gilly and finally finding his "balls" in the face of true dire need. In the books, they way he defeated the "Other" was rather non-heroic, and almost lucky if I remember correctly. You could say that in the novels by defeating the "White Walker" he found his brotherhood/reputation, but in the TV show he finally found his courage/gut/balls. And I quite like it. His scenes with Gilly so far were really heartfelt and this moment helped put a definitive stamp on this.
I still believe  Sam will have another, different opportunity in the future, to prove himself before his brothers, and the whole "Sam the Slayer" idea will be properly touched upon later.

4648	silentwanderer	2013-05-24	I think the differece with the books is that Sam was desperate, but alone. He had no one to safe but himself
On the show, it was all about Craster's baby.
Sam had to save him from the "offerings" made by the baby's Dad.
4649	Myrgirl	2013-05-26	I could not believe he was stupid enough to leave the dragon glass behind. It must mean something.
4650	Khal Porno	2013-05-31	It means he was extremely frightened and wasn't thinking straight.
4651	HAL of House 9000	2013-05-19	I know everyone was probably really upset to see that Strong Belwas would not be protecting his Little Queen this season, but I think there is still a chance he will be in the show. 
This is a bit divergent from the books, but so is Belwas not being here already. I hope that Belwas is in Yunkai, in a Fighting Pit or perhaps a pit fighter turned Wise Master bodyguard. If this were the case he would be a last second addition that we would see more of in Season 4. And it would also allow him to dominate Mereen's champion, which is one of the best scenes in aDwD, imo. 
I know that there probably are not Fighting Pits in Yunkai and that their slaves are bed warmers but here is hoping!
What do y'all think? Any other suggestions on how to get him in there? It's always possible he shows up after Mereen is sacked and is one of the pit fighters released by Jorah and Barriston, but we would miss some funny lines .
4652	alexislalas	2013-05-19	Well, if they eliminated Selmy's role as Whitebeard, I'm pretty sure Strong Belwas is a goner too.
4653	Doctor Steve Brule	2013-05-19	methinks belwas is gonna be in season 4, and his entrance will be that scene where he fights the man to death outside the meereen gates.
4654	chimere	2013-05-19	I would like to see him, but since there is nothing he does that they can't have Barristan do they might not want to cast and pay an actor to play his role. 
Actually I'm wrong, we do need someone else to eat the poisoned locusts because Barristan was a big part of arresting Dany's husband so maybe they will cast him, or make someone else eat the locusts.

4655	Garlan Marius	2013-05-19	Eh, any Belwas we'd get would be as ruined as Tormund is.

Actually I'm wrong, we do need someone else to eat the poisoned locusts because Barristan was a big part of arresting Dany's husband so maybe they will cast him, or make someone else eat the locusts.Barristan can't eat the poisoned honeyed locusts in Mereen.
4657	baxter	2013-05-19	They can introduce him as the fighter chosen to taken on the Yunkai'i warrior
4658	chimere	2013-05-19	Barristan can't eat the poisoned honeyed locusts in Mereen.Yeah that's what I meant, at first I was thinking Barristan would just eat the locusts but then I realized there would be no one to arrest Dany's husband unless they make the shapevate fill in both his and Barristans roles. But now I'm just confusing myself /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
4659	Lord Paolo Stark	2013-05-19	Belwas can't appear ramdomly in the story, it would be really confusing, he needed to appear with Arstan/Barristan
4660	Kasrith	2013-05-19	If he eventually shows up, it'll be a tiny role. Viewers won't even remember who he is, but if the big guy shows up it'll be a pure book nod
4661	Kasrith	2013-05-19	Belwas can't appear ramdomly in the story, it would be really confusing, he needed to appear with Arstan/BarristanHe can 'show up' as a pit fighter later in ADWD season
4662	A Winters Summer	2013-05-19	Belwas can't appear ramdomly in the story, it would be really confusing, he needed to appear with Arstan/BarristanReally? A fat man with scars across his belly can't appear without Barristan first? Jojen and Meera appeared on the show way after they were introduced in the books and they have a far far greater role than Belwas. I could care less if his character wasn't included untill they reach the season with DWD.
4663	BaseBornBastard	2013-05-19	Eh, any Belwas we'd get would be as ruined as Tormund is.I think, since The Climb, Tormund seems a bit more true to the books........HAR.
4664	Bran's Legs	2013-05-19	If he eventually shows up, it'll be a tiny role. Viewers won't even remember who he is, but if the big guy shows up it'll be a pure book nodIf done correctly, Belwas could be one of the shows best among the supporting cast. Here's to hoping we get to see Belwas on the screen. He's one of my favorite characters in the books and adds some much-needed comic relief.
4665	Kasrith	2013-05-19	If done correctly, Belwas could be one of the shows best among the supporting cast. Here's to hoping we get to see Belwas on the screen. He's one of my favorite characters in the books and adds some much-needed comic relief.I highly doubt it will happen though, they have way too many characters... If he shows up amongst the many pit fighters, I'll be happy
4666	wolverine	2013-05-19	Yeah.  I still think it would be fun to see him.
4667	Kasrith	2013-05-19	I think, since The Climb, Tormund seems a bit more true to the books........HAR.Agreed, he seems more like his bookish self lately
4668	Ser Areo Mace	2013-05-19	Like others have said, they can introduce him as a Pit Fighter from Yunkai that offers to fight the champion outside of Mereen.
4669	HAL of House 9000	2013-05-19	It looks like they might be rushing the sewer scene into this season if the promo (and my understanding of it) can be trusted. Darrio looks like he is going to show Jorah and Barristan somewhere - I am presuming into the sewers to take the city. If they do this, than Strong Belwas is coming in next episode or the finale. 
And the real Tormund is starting to show. We just need to hear some of his tall talking, how he sired those bears!
4670	Nictarion	2013-05-20	I forget where I saw it, but the show runners confirmed there will be no Strong Belwas at any point in the show. /frown5.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':frown5:' />

4671	Steve Fortier	2013-05-20	The sewer part is for Meereen which we won't see this season. I don't know why they change the Stormcrows for the Second Sons because Brown Ben Plum will be an important characters in aDwD rith the Tyrion storyline. There was really no point in changing the Stormcrows for the Second Sons.....
4672	Promised Prince	2013-05-20	In the trailer for the end of the season, they showed Jorah fighting (at the sewers I believe) and he said something link "your just gonna leave me and grey worm to take care of it?".....something like that.  So evidently Jorah and Grey Worm will be taking the sewer job
4673	Reposado	2013-05-20	It looks like they might be rushing the sewer scene into this season if the promo (and my understanding of it) can be trusted. Darrio looks like he is going to show Jorah and Barristan somewhere - I am presuming into the sewers to take the city.

So evidently Jorah and Grey Worm will be taking the sewer jobespecially if barristan fights outside mereen, it has to be jorah in the sewers. would have done it this way as well
4674	Greywolf2375	2013-05-20	Yeah.  I still think it would be fun to see him.It would be fun to see him, but he isn't necessary.  If they find they can't have Jorah or Selmy take on his duel, they can easily add him in any number of ways, but - aside from humor - I don't see a need to have him.Considering they've also confirmed no Strong Belwas, I think it is safe to say we won't be seeing him though.
4675	-Ghost-	2013-05-20	Im pretty sure GRRM said on his not a blog that there will be no Strong Belwas. Or maybe I imagined it, but I think he did.
4676	Stannis the Menace	2013-05-20	Didnt Belwas fight Yunkai's champion, not Mereen's?  or am i wrong
4677	Stannis the Menace	2013-05-20	nevermind it is Meereen   I forgot about the Battle for Yunkai
4678	SaskatoonX	2013-05-20	Im pretty sure GRRM said on his not a blog that there will be no Strong Belwas. Or maybe I imagined it, but I think he did.Yup, It's in the comments of that blog entry about some character miniatures or something.
4679	MarieAntoinette	2013-05-21	It would be fun to see him, but he isn't necessary.  If they find they can't have Jorah or Selmy take on his duel, they can easily add him in any number of ways, but - aside from humor - I don't see a need to have him.Considering they've also confirmed no Strong Belwas, I think it is safe to say we won't be seeing him though.I second that. It would be nice to see him on screen, but I don't think he is needed, as the cast of characters is already big enough for the 10 episodes we get each season.
4680	Rishav Banka	2013-05-21	I am really confused(and sad) with Belwas not appearing.
Now, as the things stand, Illyrio hasn't send anyone or anything(even the ships were shown as bought from objects stolen from Xaro).
I thought this support of Illyrio would be very vital since he knows about and has aided and abetted Aegon too.  And now if illyrio claims to support Dany, then here would be no foreshadowing of it.
4681	Joey Beers	2013-05-21	Strong Belwas has a couple of moments that give him life. The single combat moment in Yunkai, both the brave victory and the dump heard round the world. Later, the poisoned locusts in Mereen. Those two moments make us love Strong Belwas. If the show can find a way to make those two scenes, I'll be happy. If not, eh, his character is peripheral.
4682	Woel	2013-05-21	Everyone is upset he hasn't appeared? I consider it a blessing, actually. Stupid and useless character in the books, who would have been ludicrous on screen.
4683	Lannister Hamster	2013-05-21	I liked Belwas but can survive if he's left out.
I'd quite like to see grey worm take on the mereenese champion. Just because book Dany wanted to send someone expendable doesn't mean D&D will
4684	Koi No Yokan	2013-05-21	Strong Belwas has a couple of moments that give him life. The single combat moment in Yunkai, both the brave victory and the dump heard round the world. Later, the poisoned locusts in Mereen. Those two moments make us love Strong Belwas. If the show can find a way to make those two scenes, I'll be happy. If not, eh, his character is peripheral.I agree. I like Belwas in the books, but don't think he serves much purpose for the show. I'd much rather they focus on, say, getting Conan Stevens back as The Mountain.
4685	Ravi Seaworth	2013-05-21	I'm completely indifferent about his appearance. If they include him, then it will be a cool addition, but if not, then it is one less character. More budget becomes available to more important aspects, since his figure is not trivial to portray on TV.
4686	Kaitscralt	2013-05-21	Like Vargo Hoat, Belwas is a character I am glad not to see on the show.
4687	flinn	2013-05-21	I agree. I like Belwas in the books, but don't think he serves much purpose for the show. I'd much rather they focus on, say, getting Conan Stevens back as The Mountain. Well he serves no purpose for the show because they blew it by giving up the Barriston reveal right away. That is the biggest thing of this season that I dislike. The build up of Whitebeard and his eventual reveal (squire with a stick) followed by calling out Jorah for being the spy was a huge part of the Dany story line IMO.
4688	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-05-21	Well he serves no purpose for the show because they blew it by giving up the Barriston reveal right away. That is the biggest thing of this season that I dislike. The build up of Whitebeard and his eventual reveal (squire with a stick) followed by calling out Jorah for being the spy was a huge part of the Dany story line IMO.It was a huge part to make her somewhat dull chapters more interesting. But the reveal is fucking stupid. How long does Mormont need to stare at this 60 year old squire before he figures out it's Barristan while the entire audience is like...Oh hey look it's Barristan Selmy how exciting! Also the reveal does nothing really to advance plot besides allowing Barristan to out Jorah which can still quite easily happen a number of ways.
4689	Young Nan	2013-05-21	I'm pretty indifferent to Strong Belwas.  People compare him a lot to Tormund, because they both are "comic relief" characters, but Tormund has a more major role with bringing the wildlings across the gate and such. 
Belwas just eats poisoned bugs and shits on the ground.  They can find someone else to do that.
4690	Janicia	2013-05-21	I hope Missandei isn't the one poisoned.  She probably wouldn't survive that.
4691	ugashep	2013-05-21	Fear not, I have it on good authority that Strong Belwas will be discovered eating at a spicy locust bistro on the road to Meereen, foreshadowing future deeds. He will fight a hero of Meereen outside its walls instead of outside Yunkai, no harm done, lots of actor standing around doing little for a whole season avoided.
4692	AzorAhai42	2013-05-21	Agreed, he seems more like his bookish self latelyThey really have plenty of time to develop Tormund also. He wasn't even part of the climbing party in the books. We didn't really start to get to know him until after the battle at the Wall. At this point in the books, Tormund had much less time, is all I'm saying. We have seasons of Tormund to look forward to, thankfully, too, because I love Tormund. I just hope the show can last a few more seasons and really hook people. I'm almost worried viewership might decline after the RW.
4693	wolverine	2013-05-21	It would be fun to see him, but he isn't necessary.

He can add some levity to that part of the story, but is totally unnecessary.
4694	chris999	2013-05-21	Well, if they eliminated Selmy's role as Whitebeard, I'm pretty sure Strong Belwas is a goner too.Yep...I think that they will merge Belwas and Grey Worm into one.
4695	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-21	I don't really mind the lack of Strong Belwas, to be honest.
4696	chris999	2013-05-21	I don't really mind the lack of Strong Belwas, to be honest.Belwas is cool.I liked the fact that he was a pit fighter and I liked his jovial attitude.I hope that they at least mention the pit-fighting in Slaver's Bay because it will make Selmy much more bad ass when he kills the undefeated pitfighter in one of dany's sieges.
4697	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-21	Oh they'll definitely have the pit fighting and I quite like Strong Belwas too, but to be hones his character really isn't interesting and is basically quite jarring if we were to watch a great big man on screen like ''ME SPEAK LIKE THIS'' you know what I mean.
4698	chris999	2013-05-21	Oh they'll definitely have the pit fighting and I quite like Strong Belwas too, but to be hones his character really isn't interesting and is basically quite jarring if we were to watch a great big man on screen like ''ME SPEAK LIKE THIS'' you know what I mean.You didnt find Belwas interesting when he went in front of the walls and took a dump in front of the opposing army?lol.Belwas is anything but boring. I think he was one of the bright spots in the Slavers Bay chapters when we are all starting to get bored with Essos and are itching to see her leave for Westeros already...
4699	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-21	I thought he was hilarious but taking a shit don't show complexity of character /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' /> 
I like Belwas, I just don't have a problem with him not being cast. Dany has enough people around her atm. Considering she's got more advisers than Robb atm LOL.
4700	Koi No Yokan	2013-05-22	Well he serves no purpose for the show because they blew it by giving up the Barriston reveal right away. That is the biggest thing of this season that I dislike. The build up of Whitebeard and his eventual reveal (squire with a stick) followed by calling out Jorah for being the spy was a huge part of the Dany story line IMO.The Whitebeard scenario wouldn't have worked on the show. People would recognise the face, and would thus just drag out the time until the "reveal". Barristan still has plenty of time to call out Jorah as a spy.You didnt find Belwas interesting when he went in front of the walls and took a dump in front of the opposing army?I guess we have conflicting ideas of "interesting".

We didn't really start to get to know him until after the battle at the Wall. At this point in the books, Tormund had much less time, is all I'm saying. We have seasons of Tormund to look forward to, thankfully, too, because I love Tormund. I just hope the show can last a few more seasons and really hook people. I'm almost worried viewership might decline after the RW.Why do you think so? Many viewers were shocked at Ned's execution, but that didn't cause the ratings to plummet, and he was a far more prominent and likable character..If anything I think it reinforces the notion that no one is safe, and that is something viewers expect with the series.
4702	Joe Scallywag	2013-05-22	They could give Belwas a cameo as a pitfighter that would be a nice thing to do, give a little smile to the book fans that would know who he is.
4703	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-22	I guess we have conflicting ideas of "interesting".lol, exactly. I quite like this idea though:They could give Belwas a cameo as a pitfighter that would be a nice thing to do, give a little smile to the book fans that would know who he is.Him jst being a pit fighter might be a nice little nod.
4704	Weeping Sore	2013-05-22	You didnt find Belwas interesting when he went in front of the walls and took a dump in front of the opposing army?lol.Belwas is anything but boring. I think he was one of the bright spots in the Slavers Bay chapters when we are all starting to get bored with Essos and are itching to see her leave for Westeros already...They'll just have Barristan take the shit.
4705	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-05-22	They'll just have Barristan take the shit.Now that would be an interesting visual. Pardon me, your grace.
4706	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-22	The Whitebeard scenario wouldn't have worked on the show. People would recognise the face, and would thus just drag out the time until the "reveal".Well, won't that be exactly what they'll have to do with "Alayne" in the Eyrie?  In any case, I think it could have worked with Ser Arstan, but I don't think it really hurt the story for them to skip it.
4707	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-22	Well, won't that be exactly what they'll have to do with "Alayne" in the Eyrie?  In any case, I think it could have worked with Ser Arstan, but I don't think it really hurt the story for them to skip it.But we know Sansa is Alayne as a reader, so there was never any mystery there either. So it will just be what it is in the books.
4708	Koi No Yokan	2013-05-22	But we know Sansa is Alayne as a reader, so there was never any mystery there either. So it will just be what it is in the books.Yeah, pretty much.
4709	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-05-22	Well, won't that be exactly what they'll have to do with "Alayne" in the Eyrie?  In any case, I think it could have worked with Ser Arstan, but I don't think it really hurt the story for them to skip it.There's a big difference in keeping a mystery from the reader and keeping a mystery from the characters.
4710	Gendels Children	2013-05-23	I don't think we will be having any Belwas this season or any other. he was fun, but not a crucial character, they might not have time for the scene of him killing a man out side he city, he is also a very animated larger than life character, not always practical for a TV adaption. the only issue I can see arising from this is figuring out who will need to eat the poisoned locusts  during the events of the fighting pits in Mereen, which anyone can do really, provided they die.
4711	Darth Zyroth	2013-05-23	Strong Belwas has been cut once again! But we all know what happens after someone cuts him......Now on a serious tone, I won't be very sad, but I will miss Belwas. He wasn't very interesting or complex, but he was hilarious and a comedy relief in the Meeren storyline. I'll be sad because we won't see him killing Oznak, and then shiting in front of Meereen. I guess Barristan can kill him and that way he will show everybody how badass he still is. But I doubt he will shit..... /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />

But I doubt he will shit..... /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />Considering Ser Barristan is the one who narrates the single combat - about Oznak's lance being too long, etc. it would be fitting to have Ser Barristan defeat him.  Especially if he does it mounted and says something pithy when Ser Jorah volunteers - "you aren't much with the lance, from what I recall, except for that one tournament, but that didn't work out so well in the end, did it?  It would be my honor to defeat this creature, Your Grace"
4721	siknes	2013-05-25	It looks like they might be rushing the sewer scene into this season if the promo (and my understanding of it) can be trusted. Darrio looks like he is going to show Jorah and Barristan somewhere - I am presuming into the sewers to take the city. If they do this, than Strong Belwas is coming in next episode or the finale.And the real Tormund is starting to show. We just need to hear some of his tall talking, how he sired those bears!The heads of the other captains, just as book Daario did, because they wanted to go against Dany. The sewer scene won't be for awhile.
4722	ExBruinsFan	2013-05-27	If done correctly, Belwas could be one of the shows best among the supporting cast. Here's to hoping we get to see Belwas on the screen. He's one of my favorite characters in the books and adds some much-needed comic relief.Yep, but I think D&D don't want much comic relief.I forget where I saw it, but the show runners confirmed there will be no Strong Belwas at any point in the show. /frown5.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':frown5:' />I am disappoint, but not suprised. I suppose it was difficulty casting him?What a shame. He was one of the coolest sidekicks.I second that. It would be nice to see him on screen, but I don't think he is needed, as the cast of characters is already big enough for the 10 episodes we get each season.So, kill off Osha. She's a stupid character anyway. Imagine putting a robber and attempted murderer in charge of the Stark heirs. Idiotic.
4723	ExBruinsFan	2013-05-27	Why do you think so? Many viewers were shocked at Ned's execution, but that didn't cause the ratings to plummet, and he was a far more prominent and likable character..If anything I think it reinforces the notion that no one is safe, and that is something viewers expect with the series.SOME people are safe, and I think the viewers know it. They are not going to kill off Tyrion or Arya.
4724	Magjee	2013-05-27	It looks like Dany finishes this season with Yunkai.
Maybe Belwas can be one of the former slaves she freed or even a member of the second sons.
They could have Selmy, Mormont or Dario take his fight for Mehreen.
the only other notable thing he does is eat the poisoned locusts.
4725	ugashep	2013-05-27	Uhm, he always fought the "hero" outside Meeren, it was never Yunkai. Yeah you're right, they all have jackass hairstyles, got confused between jackasses.
4726	yushkevsh	2013-05-27	No Strong Belwas and I will boycott the show.
Okay, I'll DVR it instead of watching it live...
4727	VladofWallachia	2013-05-27	They can't cut Strong Belwas. The aftermath of the fight between him and the Mereen champion is one of the funniest moments in the book. I actually laugh out loud every time I read it or hear Roy Dotrice reading it.
4728	Batman	2013-05-28	Other than being mildy amusing, he really was a nothing character in terms of story structure. Other characters have been cut that I grieve more.
4729	Young Nan	2013-05-28	Oh they'll definitely have the pit fighting and I quite like Strong Belwas too, but to be hones his character really isn't interesting and is basically quite jarring if we were to watch a great big man on screen like ''ME SPEAK LIKE THIS'' you know what I mean.Plus, they already will have Victarion Greyjoy to fill the big man on screen talking like a caveman quota:"Thinking bad. Thinking make head hurt!  Sailing good.  Me like sailing.  Come here, dusky woman.  Me like dusky woman."

4731	Greyjoy67	2013-05-19	The 'bedding' scene was one of the best GoT scenes yet for me.
4732	go joff go	2013-05-19	I thought Sam the slayer was fantastic even if it was unwitnessed.  The cinmatography in that scene was breathtaking.
4733	TheGreenBell	2013-05-19	I love the scene where Cersei tells the story of the Rains of Castamere.
4734	shiola	2013-05-19	I am never able to watch the episodes until Mondays but those three comments are already making me so excited, holy shit.  
	Spoiler I am so stoked Cersei is explaining the song before the Red Wedding.
4735	Darth Pipes	2013-05-19	TV Daario is 1000 times better than Book Daario.  Also, I really liked Gilly suggesting Mormont as the name for her baby, even if it won't be his name.
4736	go joff go	2013-05-19	I love the scene where Cersei tells the story of the Rains of Castamere.I loved the way they did it too.  Telling it to the Tyrells was a really good idea.
4737	Garlan Marius	2013-05-19	"I'm but a young girl and know little of the ways of war."  Loved it.
4738	Lord Damian	2013-05-19	Cercei's story - erie but cool, you can feel the hate
Sam rocked though, great scene. the Wight was as horrific as in the books and Sam's courage to defend Gilly and baby is endearing. The Ravens warning them to leave and then driving them/looking after them is inspiring.

4740	The Giver	2013-05-19	Darth Vader is Luke's father!!!???!! What????!!!
Sorry, had to.
I loved all the references that are just kind of side comments, like associating Braavos with killing, the reins of castamere, and Davos' reading. Yay!
4741	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-05-19	I loved that they kept the Seconds Sons have seen worse odds and run line. I loved it in the book.
Sam's scene with the dissonant quorking buildup was wonderful.
4742	wolverine	2013-05-19	Loved Cersei being a bitch.
Thought the change to Sansa's wedding was perfect.
I like show Daario much better than book Daario.
Arya and The Hound are great on together.
EDIT:  I liked the Davos and Stannis scene quite a bit as well.

4744	go joff go	2013-05-19	Even though I cant remember the words Mel had a great ominous line about lambs not realizing they are being led to a sacrifice to Stannis that sounded like a veiled threat.  Methinks stannis is in TROUBLE!
4745	bobbybuilderton	2013-05-19	I liked Melisandre and Gendry. Only because she wasn't kidding about not seeing the blade. Hell, I even knew what she was planning to do and yet I was still super jealous of Gendry. But that's partially because CaricevanHoutenwillyoumarryme
4746	KingInTheNorth32	2013-05-19	I love the building up of possible final happiness for arya meeting up with Robb and Cat in her scene with the hound. That's how I felt reading, so happy she was going to be reunited with them....

I loved their whole exchange. Davos for King.
4748	BendTheKnee610	2013-05-19	Even having read the books, I found the Slayer scene to be particularly effective. 
Leeches.
Drunk Tyrion during the wedding.
The explanation of the "Rains of Castamere."

Yay Arya/Hound stuff!

4751	silentwanderer	2013-05-19	Arya smile. That's a first!
ETA: Also, Sansa kneeling for her husband  not to embrarras himself any further.
And "Tyrion, my name is Tyrion" which is a flawless reminder of "Jaime, my name is Jaime" and explains the difference  between the brothers situations better than anything else could.

4752	Dove	2013-05-19	"Randyll's a handsome name"":|"Sam and Gilly were hella cute, and I loved the way the whole Slayer scene was executed. Super tense and effective.I think the wedding feast in general was my second favorite part, so much good material there.Olenna contemplating the Tyrell and Lannister family trees was absolutely excellent. Cracked me up."My father once told me-" "Nobody cares what your father once told you." ahahahaha Cersei like a bossJoffrey in fine creepy form, jesus. Loved drunk Tyrion too. "My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do..."
4753	bobbybuilderton	2013-05-19	I DIED ABOUT TEN TIMES when Joffrey took the little steps.
Typical Joffrey.
4754	Titus Pullo	2013-05-20	I loved the way they wrote the Hound endearing himself to Arya in his own way. ... so he could sleep at night, if for no other reason. I'm siding with the guess that Arya gets closer to the RW than the books.
Stannis v. Davos was fantastic. I don't remember Stannis so openly having such a "maybe this God does exist" moment in the books, acknowledging the Shadow to Davos, etc. ... That brings a different dimension, and I think it worked well.
4755	victim	2013-05-20	I feel like I say this after every episode but... Ah, so much, I loved nearly everything. 
- Stannis the Mannis. Well, not entirely but I love how he finally implied that he is there to be more than just a wannabe King. "I didn't ask for this, no more than I ask to be King."
- Joffrey had me laughing out loud in this episode. Not entirely sure why.
- Tyrion had his best material all year. 
- Shae the funny whore is a lot better when she has less dramatic things to say. 
- The Rains of Castamere story was utter perfection.
- The heart tree looked completely different to the other ones we've seen.
- The Other who let Sam live was Puddles! Or Shatters or Shards or whatever we're calling him. 
- Perhaps Daario won't suck entirely.
- The show works really well when it only focuses on a few storylines in one episode. This episode felt less jumpy, I'm assuming next episode will be similar with different storylines. 
and much more to come in a later post!
4756	The Mondrian Oak	2013-05-20	Ed Skrein as Daario. A chav-looking, wanker-behaving, blonde version of Drogo. The casting department of this show is flawless. FLAWLESS, I SAY.

-I was really skeptical of how they were going to do Tyrion/Sansa, given the largely sympathetic portrayal of Tyrion, but the bed scene was pretty good IMO. Dinklage was fantastic as drunk Tyrion.
-Speaking of which, EVIL TYRION!!!! That little bit with Joffrey was fantastic
-Bitchy Cersei
-Davos reading about Visenya
-Olenna talking about the different ways Marge and Loras would be related

4758	Kienn	2013-05-20	Tyrion vs Joffrey was the best scene easily. I liked Dany v Titan's B as well.
4759	Winter In My Heart	2013-05-20	I loved the Rains of Castamere story, despite lack of subtlety. And to be honest I was laughing out loud by how Cersei threatened Margaery.Joffrey taking the stool away, it was cruel yet had me amused because its so like him.I can't remember if the line Tyrion used to threaten Joffrey with was taken exactly from the books, but I love, love, loved when he threatened him. I'm like YES!! (Despite knowing he was going to in order to stop the bedding)
4760	a shadow	2013-05-20	The hopeful music (and Arya almost smiling) after The Hound promised he was bringing her to Robb and Catelyn. /ninja.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':ninja:' />It might be the first time GoT used hopeful music ever.
4761	silentwanderer	2013-05-20	I loved the way they wrote the Hound endearing himself to Arya in his own way. ... so he could sleep at night, if for no other reason. I'm siding with the guess that Arya gets closer to the RW than the books.I thought their horseback riding was one of the most endearing scenes of the season, if not the show as a whole.
4762	amilas	2013-05-20	1: Loved the wedding scene between Tyrion and Sansa. A lot was changed, and Tyrion's character has clearly changed for the show, but it worked really well. I loved seeing everything going on behind the main characters. Well directed.
2: Arya and the Hound. Love this dynamic so far.
3: Cersei's interaction with Margaery. Everyone hates Cersei, but it was so satisfying to tell this little slut off.
4: Cersei and Loras. Poor Loras but really reinforces how detestable Cersei can be.
5: The Other's Death: The Others aren't what George wrote about but they are still very cool (ha, pun!).
6. Daario. That is all.

Arya riding on Stranger like a small child being punished. 
Cersei showing her dark side. 
Davos reading and the conversation between him and Stannis. 
Sam and Gilly talking about names.

Cersei and her "If you call me sister again I'll have you strangled in your sleep"
Lady Olenna and the complicated family tree "Joffrey will be your brothers brother in law and grandson or whatever"

4768	lannistergold	2013-05-20	- The bedding scene captured perfectly the tragedy of the whole situation, playing things fairly close to the book, but with good tweaks
- Joffrey being hilariously petty with Tyrion
- Tyrion being terrifying when drunk
- Cersei in her best tyrannical form
- Sandor nonchalantly telling Arya to have a go at him

- Tyrion vs. Joffrey
- Stannis and Davos
- Tywin turning around to silence the laughing people with a look
4770	The Pain Yak	2013-05-20	Daario has been un-douched enough that I didn't feel revulsion whenever he came on screen. Still don't expect he'll be a favorite, but yay for not-quite-so-douchey Daario!
4771	Ayrmidon Velaryon	2013-05-20	A drunken Tyrion at the prospect of a marriage without sex: "And so my watch begins". I don't think many non book readers took the reference to the vows of the night's watch but I loved it.
4772	Isildur's Mane	2013-05-20	I loved the ending - the ravens, the tree, thinking of baby names, the stabbing, I even liked how he shattered instead of melted (though my first thought was - why isn't he melting - it was really effective this way). The cinematography was great. Loved it.
I'm really loving Dany this season.
I always love Arya scenes - and Arya/Hound scenens in the books have always been a favourite and it is looking to be that way, for me, on the show too. Though it left me wanting more and thinking the scene was short... I might have to re-watch it to double check. But I did like it a lot.
I liked the second sons and their scenes. I agree that they have adapted Daario well - I don't think the book version would of worked out on TV just by how colourful and weird he looked - don't get me wrong, I'm all for people doing whatever they feel like/looking however they like, I just don't think that would have translated well on screen.
I liked the wedding: The Tyrell/Lannister relationships; I didn't mind Sansa kneeling, though i prefer the book's way; Queen of Thorns; drunk Tyrion; The bedding all pretty good.
I loved Davos trying to read. Was a sweet touch.
Overall a great episode. I give it an 8 but it was more 8.5/ 8.8 for me (I'm holding out my 9 for this one. I gave 9s to E.3 and 4 (I think))
4773	Mulled Wino	2013-05-20	Loved cersei telling loras no one cares about what his father told him.

They look ancient, alien and unknowable, but fascinating. Thumbs up for the art direction from me.

Inhumanly beautiful is creepy in it's own way, but I think for a visual medium old and inscrutable works as well.
4777	mafalda	2013-05-20	First off, I love that there was NO THEON this episode. His torturing does not need to be chronicled in every episode. It's too much, and no one likes it.
And no Jon. Jon is really boring me this season, and I can't stand Ygritte. But since this is a board about POSITIVE nitpicking, I'll get on with it:
Dany and Daario, Dany and Daario. Those scenes were awesome. And it was really cool and unexpected to see the Second Sons discussing matters on their own. Easily my favorite scenes of the episode (lmao @ what the whore was wearing, wtf!)
Of course the wedding was done nicely
Arya and the Hound. I don't know why people are complaining about this, I didn't see much wrong with it. The only regret I have is, the tavern chapter. Because the Tickler's already effing dead!
I'm sure there's more. I just really enjoyed this episode and gave it a 9 (minus one for the Orgy at Dragonstone).
4778	Mother of Mini Dragons	2013-05-20	I pretty much loved all of it (except for Mel & Gendry).  So I'll say - All of it!  
- Arya and the Hound - thumbs up 
Although
	Spoiler  Arya's little smile at the end at the thought of seeing her mother again almost made me cry. 

- Sam the Slayer!!!!
- I enjoyed the introduction of Daario and I can't wait to see what Jorah thinks about him. 
- I thoroughly enjoyed everything at King's Landing. I really like Cersei and Margaery's 'talk' and the way that Cersei looked uncomfortable for Marg to even be touching her.  Poor Loras!
- I enjoyed the conversation between Davos and Stannis.
4779	bobbybuilderton	2013-05-20	WELL, I've only just realized Tywin let the bodies of the Reynes rot all summer...and that their summers last for years. 
Casterly Rock must have been a cheerful place.
4780	Queen Elsa	2013-05-20	Okay, where to start...
Arya and the Hound kinda endearing especially the shot where Arya half-hugging Sandor. I want more.
Dany meeting with the Second Sons is great. Like the last look Daario gave to Dany.
Davos trying to read - aawww.
Tyrion and Sansa's wedding is really fancy. Good job hbo. I'm looking forward to a fancier Purple Wedding.
Joffrey's "What. did. you. say?" Such an evil bastard. Fantastic acting by Jack Gleeson. Bravo!

Loved seeing Sam the Slayer in action [but why leave the dragonglass behind, Sam - why?]
Also loved the Sandor/Arya scene...just wish we could see more of them.
4782	WinterfellRose	2013-05-20	Loved Arya and the Hound, wish their scene lasted longer. Awww, the way she was half hugging him...
Davos learning to read from a children's book + his scene with Stannis
All things Tyrion in this episode, PD is great
I did not mind Mel+Gendry, even only because yay shirtless Gendry!!! hot /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />
Have you noticed Sansa's doll on her dressing table next to the mirror? The same doll Ned has given her and that she was holding during her scene with the Hound in 'Blackwater'? Love these little nods to the audience...
4783	silentwanderer	2013-05-20	Arya and the Hound kinda endearing especially the shot where Arya half-hugging Sandor. I want more.Me too, for some reason Sandor strikes me as someone who has never been hugged before, or at least not on camera.The fact his first onscreen hug was Arya's - and her first smile was because of Sandor's - made the Hound and the wolf one of the higlights of the episode to me.

4784	lizziebeth	2013-05-20	So much to love in this episode. 
-Arya and the Hound.  Finally a little hope for a Stark. 
-Sansa/Tyrion wedding.  Didn't mind the changes at all, and I really enjoyed Joffrey too, evil little shit that he is.  And Drunk Tyrion is awesome.
-Daario isn't as douchey as the book version, and looks more normal (no blue beard and yellow clothes).  I think I might like him a bit, at least more than the book version.  They did let him keep the naked lady handles to his dagger and arkh.
-Dany is awesome as usual.
- Davos learning to read is the most adorable thing I've seen in a very long time. That got a legit "awwww" out of me.
4785	Jamie Lannister	2013-05-20	Tyrion and Cersei were killers this episode. Loved them.
4786	Summerfell	2013-05-20	Really good episode.
-Drunk Tyrion was hilarious!
-Peter Dinklage's and Sophie Turner's acting all through the wedding (and basically every other episode). Awesome.
-Davos trying to read. Poor guy has to figure out all those ridiculous names, it's hard enough for us!
-Davos/Stannis scene. I'm not a huge Stannis fan but he was cool this episode.
-Dany/Second Sons scenes. I thought the Titan's Bastard was hilarious, and I especially liked the scene where it was just the Second Sons discussing murdering Dany. I agree that Daario was surprisingly non-douche-y.
-I appreciated Cersei's Rains of Castamere story and the nice set up it provided.
-Sam the Slayer!
Favorite lines (that I can remember):
"No one cares what your father said." *leaves* if someone could do that to Loras every time he opened his mouth I wouldn't mind at all.
"Please don't name him Randyll." Actually I really enjoyed all of Sam and Gilly's dialogue in the hut, it was wonderfully awkward.
4787	SilentSense	2013-05-20	-The sound when the White Walker grabbed Sam's sword
4788	Queen Elsa	2013-05-20	Loved the Cersei scenes, played out both in true Cruella form.  I was a bit surprised that I really liked Margaery being taken aback, for a change.  [But poor Loras!  He definitely didn't deserve that, but, then, I guess that's what makes Cersei Cersei.Cersei shamed both the Tyrells, and I kinda like both siblings being speechless. Typical Cersei but t'was great.ETA: Imagine if Marg said, "Mother" instead of "Sisters." Cersei might chop her on her sleep. Looking forward for more Cersei and Marg scenes after this. Got to be good.

I was legit laughing-out-loud at it.People shutting up when Tywin looks at them.Joffrey being super creepy.  I actually didn't find it amusing like I'm seeing some posters did; I found it terrifying and I felt so anxious for Sansa.  In fact, most of the wedding had this air of being very tense and uncomfortable and Tyrion's "jokes" did not come off as funny to me either.  Everything made me nervous and felt unpleasant in a way that I really, really liked  and thought was super well done.  Props to the actors and writers, man.  That scene was perfect.But the funny moment of the wedding was definitely Olenna contemplating the family tree.  HAH!  That was perfect.The Hound being shown in a more positive light.

4798	Dove	2013-05-20	More things I loved....Joffrey being super creepy.  I actually didn't find it amusing like I'm seeing some posters did; I found it terrifying and I felt so anxious for Sansa.  In fact, most of the wedding had this air of being very tense and uncomfortable and Tyrion's "jokes" did not come off as funny to me either.  Everything made me nervous and felt unpleasant in a way that I really, really liked  and thought was super well done.  Props to the actors and writers, man.  That scene was perfect.This really sums up my feelings perfectly. The whole thing was just so amazingly tense, awkward and uncomfortable and it made you feel so terrible for both parties involved. Painful awkwardness that concentrated is nearly as affecting and hard to watch for me as explicit violence and the like, if that makes any sense.I laughed out loud at the absurdity of some of his lines but I loved that even Tyrion's jokes didn't dispel the tension and got one or two uneasy laughs from the other characters at most.

I would like a disclaimer for myself, which is that I ONLY thought Joffrey taking the steps was funny. That's it. Partially because I wondered how they'd do it with there being no fools/jesters in the show
4801	Winter's Ghost	2013-05-20	My favorite parts had to be the Sam and Gilly scenes, I thought it was really well done, the crows, the Weirwood tree, it all came together in a really great way.

4803	Angmar	2013-05-20	Sam the Slayer!
The Rains of Castamere mention.
The wooden cock and Joffrey's screams at that.
No horrible Theon torture scene this episode.
Drunk!Tyrion is more likeable than normal Tyrion.
Arya and the Hound...Wanted more of them.
Davos learning to read.
When people started to laugh at the wedding, Tywin gave a glance and everyone shut up. Perfect nod to the books.

The episodes flows better when there are few story arcs in them. Unfortunately, they can't tell the story if they keep it this way most of the time
4805	Newstar	2013-05-20	Davos learning to read.
Cersei recoiling when Margaery took her arm and snapping at Loras.
Joffrey stealing the stool. I still laugh thinking about it.
The directing and cinematography in general. Some really neat shots going on.
Sam! (Although I can't believe he left the White Walker-killing dagger behind. YOU HAD ONE JOB.)
Everything about the wedding. So awful, but it was amazing in its awfulness.
4806	Bronn son of Bronn	2013-05-20	Ser Barristan looking like a Jedi master whilst looking at the sellswords' camp
4807	AliKat	2013-05-20	I literally cheered when Sam stabbed the white walker/other. I knew it was coming but I was so proud of him.
I had all kinds of Davos, Sansa, Tyrion, Shae, Gendry feels this week. I like Davos more and more each time - Liam totally blows away that character. I love that he was so proud of himself for reading. I also loved the fact that he called Stannis out for letting him out when he did to be Stannis' conscience.Someone needs to be with his psycho wife and his  'red woman'. In my mind, Melisandre is a morally ambigious character in the books. In the show, she's just crazy and evil. I literally wanted to smack her for what she did to Gendry. That poor boy did nothing wrong and has been shit on for 2 seasons only to get promised the good life for a few minutes before she decides to torment him. If he and Arya turned out to mass murdering fanatics in a few years because of all the people that betray them as soon as they trust them - I wouldn't be surprised! Arya is totally befuddled by the Hound now.
Sansa/Tyrion - both of them were sympathetic. Tywin should have put a stop to Joffrey's mockery of Tyrion because it mocked the whole family. Cersei threatening Margaery was a shock since she was sugary sweet to her face in the books.I don't see Tyrion/Shae's storyline following the book plotline honestly.
	Spoiler I really think they'll change it because they've made Shae a good person who isn't selfish, greedy, or the type to betray him. She genuinely cares for him and Sansa I think.

Olenna's family relations commentary was killing me. After Loras stomped off I felt like Margaery gave her a 'who's side are you on!?' look. lol
Tyrion had some excellent one-liners. "I'm the god of tits and wine" "Now my watch begins" etc. I also liked Gendry's explanation of a bowl of brown where he said they pretended it was chicken. His face when he says 'we knew it wasn't chicken' was precious lol Sam/Gilly's baby name discussion was cute too.
The jury is still out on Daario and Dany's storyline. I did like her telling Barristan to kill Titan's Bastard first. I didn't understand why she would stand up completely nude in front of Daario after he threatened to kill her handmaid then said he wanted to fight for Dany cuz she was hot. But I guess they had to remind people what Emilia looks like naked or something?

4809	silentwanderer	2013-05-20	The Stannis/Davos dungeon scene was amazing.I think it captured the key of their friendship (honesty above all) and paid a silent respect to Matthos (Davos's son).

4810	StannisandDaeny	2013-05-20	I liked how downright nasty the Titan's Bastard was, I've been writing a character (or characters) like this in my own work for a long time now, and it's good to see a guy like that on screen... Of course I was disappointed when he died before his time.

4812	Low Born	2013-05-20	Absolutely love this thread, it's such a breath of fresh air after scrolling through all the other negative ones. In fact it might become the only thread for the show that I check anymore. Anyway, need to watch it again but on first slightly inebriated viewing:
Arya & the Hound - had almost forgotten how excited I was on my first reading when I thought she was actually going to reunite with Robb and Catelyn but this (too short) scene got me right back there...
Cersei verbally smacking Tyrells around 
Joffrey being such a wonderful punk ass kid
Theon & Talissa being MIA
Charles Dance - can not imagine a better casting choice for Tywin.

All the negativity is hindering my enjoyment of the series. I'll probably stick to the book forums for season 4 and beyond. I'd just started to learn to take adaptations for what they are after the 5th Harry Potter movie disappointed me, and now I'm back here getting myself agitated focusing on all the ways the show is different.
4814	Ororo727 Jon Snow Fangirl	2013-05-20	I loved it.  Closest thing to perfect this side of Dracarys.
I cannot love hating Stannis pretending not want the Throne, we know that he has always coveted it, any more than in this episode. He actually looked vulnerable for a quick second when Davos called him out on why he chose that particular day to release him.
I like how the Hound calls Arya wolf girl, instead of 
	Spoiler wolf bitch, as in the books.

The sellswords are as crude as I imagined them to be.  Too bad Mero lost that beautiful head of his.  At least we have Daario /drool.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':drool:' /> to fill this screen with hotness.
The entire wedding was flawless.  Tywin is the epitome of Boss.
Daenerys not batting an eye at Mero's disrepect, as well as, standing up to Daario naked as the day that she was born.  "Ser Barriston, if there is a battle, kill that one first". Boss.
The inflection in Ser Jorahs' voice when he said, "they have faced greater odds and run" had me crying.
Sam the Slayer.
4815	Sidonie	2013-05-20	I thought the scene where Sam and Gilly are listening to all the ravens squaking outside was done really well. It was 10,000 more creepy than I could have imagined it from the books.
4816	Lord_Baelish	2013-05-20	This is my favourite episode of the series so far. If it continues to get stronger week by week we are in for one hell of a great finale (yes, I have read the books so I know what is coming).
For a moment I thought they weren't going to show Stannis being uncomfortable with the idea of sacrificing an innocent. It would have gone completely against his character to cut it, so in the end I was pleased with his scene with Davos. Although I thought the whole burning of the leeches bit could have been made a little more dramatic.
All the Dany scenes (especially the nuddy part!) were done really well. It looks like the casting department have pulled out another gem with Daario.
But my three favourite scenes were:
3) The wedding. Everything about it was brilliantly choreographed and beautifully acted. From the smirk on Joff's face throughout to Tyrion's drunkenness and his threat, it was done to perfection. I am so glad that they got Sansa to kneel for the cloak scene. Without getting a viewpoint inside her head, to do it like in the book would have just made her seem callous to a lot of people.
2) Arya and Sandor. They need an entire episode dedicated to them just riding around. Talk about a dream team. The world would tremble.
1) Sam the Slayer, at last! Even if he did it with no NW witnesses this time. I don't think they could have done a better job with this scene. Even knowing what was coming, all those ravens up in the tree sent a shiver through me and had me grinning with excitement. And the way Sam killed the Other was spot on too (except that he forgot to retrieve the dagger, silly boy).
Anyway, it was a belter of an episode and I can't believe I have to wait two weeks for the next one!

4823	bobbybuilderton	2013-05-20	I just realized Stannis said "how can you deny her god is real?" Not his god. I liked it, because if you're paying attention it means he hasn't accepted it and it really is reluctant duty,
4824	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-20	Daario reading, Dany bringing the sass, Daario as someone actually likable and charming, the wedding was beautiful, The Rains of Castamere explanation, Cersei showing some fire, SAM THE FUCKING SLAYER WAS FABULOUS.
4825	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-20	MERO'S TONGUE AHAHAHAHAH
4826	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-20	I LOVED Arya and Sandor too.
4827	Nictarion	2013-05-20	A lot to like in this episode. The Hounds telling Arya how he saved Sansa was a good scene. Sam the Slayer was badass, glad they did that scene justice. I really liked the casting choice for Daario, I instantly liked him, although I am in the minority that likes book Daario as well. The drunken Tyrion scenes were quite possibly the funniest of the series to date. When he told Sansa " I vomited on a girl once , middle of the act, not proud of it" I was cracking up . /lol.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lol:' />
4828	silentwanderer	2013-05-20	I thought the scene where Sam and Gilly are listening to all the ravens squaking outside was done really well. It was 10,000 more creepy than I could have imagined it from the books.Better than any scary movie too.I guess they key is to use characters that don't have it them to survive the situation.Sam and Gilly are more engaging to me because I know they can't beat such a thing.

-Joffrey being Joffrey, I did kind of chuckle when he took the stool away
- This Daario > Book Daario, though to be honest if they just drew a stick figure of Daario and that have that piece of paper play him, paper > book daario.
- Sam growing a pair
- Shae wasn't a complete $%#^ in this episode, a rarity
- Cercei reminding the viewers that even though she showed vulnerability last season, she is still not a nice person
- Arya/Hound, especially when they were on the horse, it was kinda cute
- Gendry having a significant contribution to the plot and kissed a girl for the first time
4830	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-05-20	Did anyone notice Pycelle creeping on the woman in the wedding? Lol I love the actors voice. Reminds me of that scene in S1 when Littlefinger says "Almost as brazen as attacking the hand of the king..." And Pycelle just makes a trailing wuhhhhhhhj noise.
4831	ghost23	2013-05-20	Sam: "Please don't name him Randyll..." John Bradley is excellent in this episode.
4832	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-05-20	Sam: "Please don't name him Randyll..." John Bradley is excellent in this episode.His reaction to the name Craster was also pretty on point.
4833	bobbybuilderton	2013-05-20	Pretty sure his lip trembled when he said his father was a different kind of  cruel.
	Spoiler 
hopefully they reveal how INSANE his father is even more. Randyll Tarly made a big impact despite few scenes and only hearing about his treatment of Sam. I totally believe that Sam would be terrified of even thinking about the answer to if his father was cruel to him

ETA: I didn't even realize that Tywin's glare at the people laughing in the audience was totally in character for him and he was probably super pissed. He HATES people laughing at his family. Brilliant.

4834	Fat Mac	2013-05-20	I loved this episode. Much better than last week. I'd say the best was
-Sam/Gilly was adorable and badass at the end.
-Olenna pointing out the Tyrell-Lannister relations
-Cersei threatening Margaery and totally blowing Loras off.
-Drunk Tyrion
-Tyrion and Sansa. Minus the kneeling, the scene was almost done perfectly, given the fact that the law interferes with doing it just as the books did it.
-Davos/Stannis conversation.
Overall, great episode. Shame no Jaime though.
4835	Janicia	2013-05-20	There were a couple of points where you saw... if not fear at least deep concern... in Tywin's eyes while the wedding festivities were going on.  The event was so close to lurching into disaster at several points; I think he was thinking maybe it would have been better to send Tyrion back to Casterly Rock after all.
4836	Bastard of Driftwood	2013-05-20	I loved having Tyrion say ".. and now my watch begins" right before passing out. So in line with his sense of humour - he can make the best of any situation.

They both came across completely natural, and very believable.  It's a minor role, but I think the girl playing Gilly is great.

4862	Khal Pono	2013-05-21	I love Davos.  He's become the ethical heart of the show since Ned Stark died.
4863	JonCon's Red Beard	2013-05-21	I loved Sam trying to be all philosophical about the blink and wink, and Gilly being more streetwise about it.
Joffrey was perfect this episode. He looks very twisted when he bites his lip (I can't believe he's portrayed by such a sweet person)
Speaking of Joff, was he wearing the outfit he was trying on a few episodes before? Looked like.
4864	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-21	I always love Jack Gleeson as Joffrey /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
4865	Khal Pono	2013-05-21	Other things I loved:
Carice van Houten and Emilia Clarke (and hell, Joe Dempsie) looked AMAZING.  Who in his/her right mind would complain about having to endure looking at their bodies? And Melisandre and Dany were both using their naked bodies in shows of strength (Melisandre's somewhat more twisted than Dany's).
The fucking birds at the end of the show.  I figured book purists and first time viewers alike LOVED that shit.  It was so beautifully done.
Lots of cute winks and nods and foreshadowing (and a meta-discussion about intentional "Winks" by Sam and Gilly--loved it!).  I won't get into the foreshadowing since this thread is spoiler-free, but some of the nods included Dany stumbling over the same Dothraki phrase that Irri was trying to teach her in Season 1.  I laughed very hard at that.  Also I thought Dany fiercely rising from the tub was a callback to Gwen Christie's scene from episode 5.
Lots of excellent dialogue lifted straight from the books, especially in the wedding scene.
I think this was my favorite episode so far.

Not that I blame him.  Rage/outrage in those circumstances is understandable.  But it still makes it clear that he's no angel.Osha is definitely better in the show and Viserys was played to perfection by Harry Lloyd.The number of relatively minor characters whom actually seem better on the show (or at least, meet the most hopeful expectations) is just amazing to me.

Also Joffrey squealing and his voice breaking for the bedding ceremony was awesome.I thought Tyrion was "adding" drunkenness to it, to play up the "oh crap, drunkenness is my only out from having just threatened the king" and he was going to seem considerably less drunk after he closed the door, which would have IMO shown some cleverness on his part.  But then he seemed just as drunk anyway.

Look at the kid who played Malfoy in Harry Potter; he only plays assholes after that.
4907	silentwanderer	2013-05-21	As I understand it, Gleeson is an scholar and theology student that acts for fun.
I reckon he would be a brilliant professor or a brilliant actor whatever career path he chooses. But Joffrey would've  never been this compelling in the hands of a lesser actor.

4917	morgan1028	2013-05-21	I love the onion knight.  I struggle over those Targ name as well.  I never really liked Stan, but Davos made me like him...  I liked Cercei's comment to Marg... I know it wasn't subtle but, that is what she is really feeling

4922	Lady Arwen	2013-05-21	Duncan being the first name Sam said.  Just nice knowing he thinks of his brother.Did Sam have a brother named Duncan? I thought he had a younger brother named Dickon (speaking of dreadful names).
4923	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-05-21	His brother is Dickon. I liked Duncan as a reference to old Dunk the lunk, who was again referenced early in S1.

Awww at him addressing Sansa mostly as little bird and your sister. Sandor thinking about Sansa. ;-; Bless him.
4927	Ororo727 Jon Snow Fangirl	2013-05-21	His brother is Dickon. I liked Duncan as a reference to old Dunk the lunk, who was again referenced early in S1.Yes.  Tristofer is another from the story.  I actually like that one.
4928	lostinasia	2013-05-22	I thought Tyrion was "adding" drunkenness to it, to play up the "oh crap, drunkenness is my only out from having just threatened the king" and he was going to seem considerably less drunk after he closed the door, which would have IMO shown some cleverness on his part.  But then he seemed just as drunk anyway.I really liked that touch: already being pretty hammered, but not knowing he was hammered; then pretending to be even more drunk to get out of the threat; then trying to return to what he thought was sobriety, only to discover, oops, maybe I'm not as sober as I thought.Loved Tywin looking like he's being surprisingly decent towards his son, until you realize that he's just doing it for Lannister reputation: this somehow makes him simultaneously a better and a worse person.
	Spoiler (I suppose this could qualify as a spoiler: Loved that we're starting to see more of Cersei's drunkenness - I wasn't just imagining a bit of stumbling, was I?)

But then he seemed just as drunk anyway.LMAO this is exactly what I thought!  I thought he was going to start walking straight as soon as they were behind closed doors, but nope...   The wedding scene was fantastic overall but even from reading this I appear to have missed a few bits (Pycelle creeping? Yes please!) and I'll need a rewatch.  Oh such a chore.Also, I've been lurking here for a while but only started posting recently.  I wish I'd started reading the positive nitpicking threads earlier because they are really pleasant to read.  The show is definitely NOT perfect but some of the threads are so heavy on the negativity I often wonder am I watching a different show altogether. /eek.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':eek:' />
4931	Woel	2013-05-22	Jack deserves and Emmy for his portrayal of Joffrey. That guy is a good actor who majors in Hebrew studies and might not continue acting.  Go figure.Hebrew? I thought he studied philosophy or something...
4932	Lady Sansa Stark	2013-05-22	Sandor telling Arya he saved Sansa, and Arya's face is just like ''NOOOOO''.
''... you'll be fucking your bride with a wooden cock.''
Sam and Gilly together, and thinking of the names, and Sam the Slayer, period.
Drunk Tyrion not giving any fuck, even if it humiliated Sansa.
Davos trying to read. What a victory.
''Nobody cares what your father once said.'' Right in your face.
''If you call me sister again, I'll have you strangled in your sleep.'' Brilliant. 
Olenna talking to Margaery and Loras. That was simply priceless. Whoever thought of that, I salute you!

4935	bobbybuilderton	2013-05-22	I liked Duncan for a baby name. Then again, I liked Mormont too.Gilly is cute in a really weird way. She is singlehandedly making me able to tolerate watching Sam. Sam does some important stuff but he was far from my favorite character to read. So looking forward to the scenes they have together must be largely due to the actress playing Gilly.
4936	silentwanderer	2013-05-22	She's homey in a way.
They could be sorrounded by crows, in the middle of nowhere, a White Walker after them and Gilly could make a home from any corner of the snow. no matter what.

4937	The Monkey	2013-05-22	Speaking of Gilly and Sam, do you think the burned house they stayed in was supposed to be Osha's house? She mentioned last episode how she burned it down when her hubby became a zombie.
4938	'96Buck	2013-05-22	Speaking of Gilly and Sam, do you think the burned house they stayed in was supposed to be Osha's house? She mentioned last episode how she burned it down when her hubby became a zombie.No real reason to assume so, but certainly it COULD be.  There are lots of abandoned wildling hamlets beyond the Wall.  IIRC, Osha does not have that speech in the book, yet Sam and Gilly did find a house, so at least in the source material, I don't believe the link is there.  Since Osha bypassed the wall to the west and since Sam should be well east of there (starting at Craster's and at least TRYING to go S or SE), it does not seem highly likely.But I guess Osha had to get west to bypass the wall, wherever she may have started, so that may not be worth much.
4939	silentwanderer	2013-05-22	Speaking of Gilly and Sam, do you think the burned house they stayed in was supposed to be Osha's house? She mentioned last episode how she burned it down when her hubby became a zombie.If not, then I would rather think it should be from now on. Clever nitpicking!

Anyway, definitely my favourites in this episode are:Tywin's GLARE at the Wedding GuestsTyrion stabbing the table and showing some, albeit drunken, anger. I don't think we've ever seen him angry.The mass of crows on the weirwood tree. I was getting some Hitchcock vibes, I gotta tell you.

For her, the whole Loras marrying Cersei idea is not a closed subject, and she's got something brewing to stop it.  I can't quite figure out what, but she's too intelligent to have been beaten that easily by Tywin, and then to be playing up Loras' torment without some underlying plan.Anyway, to stick with the theme of the thread, I agree with all of those observations.  Sucks to be Loras, but it was good writing anyway.

4975	Ironborn Iditarod	2013-05-24	Daenerys's "If we do go to battle, kill that man first"It never gets old.The look Barristan gives when he responds "Gladly..." is fantastic.  So angered and disgusted by the complete lack of respect shown to Dany.As others have said, Jorah's line about the Second Suns running in that scene was on point as well.

(maybe because my eyes were all over the place...) That's an awesome little character detail.  Daario knows what to do.Arya looking very much like a little girl again, side-saddle in front of the Hound.Hah, yes!  She's killed someone (multiple people?  I don't remember) and suddenly there she is sulking on a horse like she's gotten yelled at by a parent.  It reminds us she's still a child.The Cersei scene telling Margarey the story about Tywin was awesome. Margareys facial expressions are amazing.I know!  She tries to keep her sugary-sweet facade up but it cracks for the first time.  Love it.  Shit's getting real between them!
4988	A Bear covered in Fluff	2013-05-25	I didn't understand why she would stand up completely nude in front of Daario after he threatened to kill her handmaid then said he wanted to fight for Dany cuz she was hot. But I guess they had to remind people what Emilia looks like naked or something?She was in a vulnerable position and still ended up large and in charge which I personally appreciated. Being completely helpless in a room with an armed man and still able to get him to bow to you? That's classic badass dany

I think Missandei knows Daenerys is good to her and wouldn't hurt her but doesn' t want to make her angry in any way because she's seen what happens when the Khaleesi gets pissed...
4992	BlackTalon	2013-05-26	Nathalie Emmanuel is a  damn fine actress, she doesn't get enough credit around here because so many people swoon over Emilia Clarke.

4997	go joff go	2013-05-19	I'm surprised noone is talking about this but for the second time this season (the first being with Arya) Melissandre seemed to drop a gigantic bombshell.  I thought her scene which Stannis in which she tells him the lambs she sacrifice never know its coming. So who is she talking about (and it aint Gendry)
Is it Stannis or Jon?  I thought it was a very interesting line.
4998	Neeps on a Breastplate	2013-05-20	Oo, nice. Bump.
4999	Kienn	2013-05-20	It was so Stannis could go "Oh dang she likes to murder a lot of people, hmmmmm, lemme go talk to Davos maybe he was right about her being an evil maniac."
5000	The Knight of Flours	2013-05-20	Renly might be lamb, but Stannis is probably mutton..
5001	pantouflas	2013-05-20	I thought she meant Gendry, but Stannis decided for the sex/leeches thing instead.. At least for the moment he isn't sacrificed
5002	Tony Soprano	2013-05-20	It's Gendry. It's certainly not Stannis, nor Jon. 
It was just a way to convince Stannis to let her do whatever she wanted with Gendry. No foreshadowing.
5003	The Fourth Head	2013-05-20	IIt was so Stannis could go "Oh dang she likes to murder a lot of people, hmmmmm, lemme go talk to Davos maybe he was right about her being an evil maniac."^this.They did choose to linger on her rather challenging face and his look back, which was interesting. It looked to be about more than Gendry and his fate, or her ruthlessness in comparison to Stannis' morality. It looked to be about them.I don't think the show is making Melisandre into a traitor-in-waiting for Stannis, or foreshadowing that she will lead Stannis to the slaughter in future, (the book strongly suggests her faith in Stannis is genuine) but it could well be that the writers wanted Stannis to suspect he may be led to the slaughter by Melisandre in future and to emphasise the obvious parallels between Gendry and Stannis. To make him feel uneasy about her faith in him just as she is about to perform something sexual with some fresh king-meat is an interesting sub-level. Show Stannis may believe in her red god, but I doubt he truly believes he is Azor Ahai reborn. Book Stannis certainly doesn't. He is using Melisandre, and may feel like she is using him too.The line, the look, it worked well. For Stannis to suspect he may be in the same boat as Gendry would add another level to his motivation to rescue him. It doesn't necessarily mean foreshadowing. No doubt she meant exactly what she said- she had killed before when learning her blood magic. She was proving to Stannis her resolve to go through with the killing and soothing his jealousy that it wasn't just about sex, or that she was leaving him for someone who's fire burn't a little higher, but Stannis took it another way- that she was about to do something immoral, that she was about to have full on sex with a kingly rival, and that she was a danger, to him as much as to Gendry, and that she needed reigning in.I love the sexual dimension to it as well. By stopping Melisandre, Stannis did a moral act, but he was also stopping Melisandre from, probably, having full sexual intercourse with Gendry. Who knows? It's all deliciously complicated.

5004	Drogo_1	2013-05-20	She was referring to Gendry but the underlying thing I took away is that Stannis is also a lamb who has no idea how he will be sacrificed.
5005	lostinwesteros	2013-05-20	Yeah, I'm in line with this.  And the Stannis as a lamb thing is, IMO, a perfect metaphor.  Lambs are easily led, and they're pretty stupid.  I didn't see book Stannis this way but it's exactly how I think tv Stannis is being portrayed -- Mel's puppet who has nowhere near the clearest ideas of what Mel is about to do or what she is all about.
5006	Sand11751	2013-05-20	Oooh, I love this idea of Stannis as a lamb. It's clear fromwhat Melisandre and Thoros say, they believe in the lord of light using people for a purpose. That's obviously regardless of their own will and if people want to be used. Last night I did think Stannis gave her the "Hold up, wait a minute" look, but not in the context of himself as a lamb, but rather, "I think this bitch is a a little cray-cray. Lemme check in with my man Davos and have him set me straight." Interesting idea of Stannis being sacrificed, one I am all in favor of after the events of ADWD.
5007	Queen Elsa	2013-05-20	Renly might be lamb, but Stannis is probably mutton.. /lol.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lol:' />She was referring to Gendry but the underlying thing I took away is that Stannis is also a lamb who has no idea how he will be sacrificed.Davos will save them both, I hope.
5008	Head of The Ned	2013-05-20	The only foreshadowing was when Stannis said he saw a vision in the flames "a great battle in the snow"
I'll admit I got a nerd hard on when I heard that.

5009	ServantOnIce	2013-05-20	Stannis is just a mean's to an end, defeating The Great Other . . is her goal.
5010	Arjuous	2013-05-20	I appreciate the initiative, but I'm afraid I don't see it.  We know from Mel's POV chapter that she truly believes in Stannis.  If it weren't for that chapter, I'd give your theory a bit more leeway, but, at least according to the books, she's genuinely invested in Stannis.
5011	shiola	2013-05-20	Davos, please become the great shepherd <3  Deliver your woolen baby from evil.
5012	PetyrPunkinhead	2013-05-20	The only foreshadowing was when Stannis said he saw a vision in the flames "a great battle in the snow"I'll admit I got a nerd hard on when I heard that.Hard-ons of every variety abound in this episode.
5013	The Anti-Targ	2013-05-20	Well we know from DwD and her inner monologue that Mel believes Stannis is the PwwP / AAR. I'm working on the assumption that show Mel hasn't been given any book spoilers in the flames to tell her otherwise.Therefore I took the lamb reference at face value to be both general: sometimes most of the time human sacrifice is required to advance the LoL's agenda, and specific: Gendry is toast, first the leeching, then the dying (of the usurper kings) party trick, she saw their deaths in the flames then does the leeching to fake everyone out, then the burning to try to wake the stone dragons.I fully expect Gendry's arc to follow that of Edric and Davos will save him from the flames, and in the process show Stannis the less burny-sacrificy way to be a king in deed to the people of Westeros.Edit: That said in events after DwD Mel might come to a realisation that Stannis isn't AAR, but rather the latter day Nissa Nissa. But as far as the show is concerned the lamb thing is not Mel's conscious foreshadowing of her intentions towards Stannis.

5014	JonCon's Red Beard	2013-05-21	Stannis is just a mean's to an end, defeating The Great Other . . is her goal.I always thought her goal was to find Jon, and Stannis was just the mean to him. But if you're right, then Jon may be also a tool in her plans.
5015	The Killer Snark	2013-05-21	I'd really never considered this that deeply, though the fact she must know Stannis is not Azor Ahai has always been playing in my mind. The possibility of Stannis being sacrificed to suit Mel's agenda is the only possible conclusion I can come up with as to why she latched on to him in the first place.

5016	Master Forel's Fro	2013-05-21	I always thought someone (varys) send her to stannis, He is the rightfull heir of Robert (not counting the Targ kids) she fucks him up new god, burning ppl alive turns the rightfull king against nobles and small folk alike that by the time he sits the IT no one would want him there even more then they did in the beginning. Making the young, Aegon even more appealing as king.
5017	The Killer Snark	2013-05-21	Very intelligent, Forel. Melisandre, after all, seems impervious from seeing developments in Essos in the flames.
5018	eyeheartsansa	2013-05-21	I really wanted stannis to be like, what, I'm not a laah ah ah ah aaaaamb!

But if you're right, then Jon may be also a tool in her plans.oh yeah, Jon is the man she has been after im quite sure, and I think at this point in the books she knows it even if she doesn't realise that she does. she shows great interest in that young man and its probably based on more than one reason... ha ha and Jons just like "ew, bitch no!"  but it should be interesting to see where his/her story goes after he wakes up

5020	Lady Tippy Wolfsbane	2013-05-26	I'm surprised noone is talking about this but for the second time this season (the first being with Arya) Melissandre seemed to drop a gigantic bombshell.  I thought her scene which Stannis in which she tells him the lambs she sacrifice never know its coming. So who is she talking about (and it aint Gendry)Is it Stannis or Jon?  I thought it was a very interesting line.The moment she said it, I thought she was referring to Stannis. I also thought that Stannis felt it too, and that was the reason he went to Davos for counsel. Stannis is beginning to realize that Mel has her own agenda and he is simply a piece in her puzzle.
5021	Logodnica	2013-05-19	So we won't see Coldhands until next season.  I'm strangely ok with that.  I assume they'll develop him on the journey with Bran.  Maybe have him meet Bran S4E5.
5022	Ran	2013-05-19	Coldhands is neat, but... are we sure we're going to see him? I don't know, if you consider his actual role, it can easily be replaced by Jojen just knowing exactly where they need to go, and Samwell just happening to come across them.
I think they'll keep Coldhands if his actual identity matters. Like, if he's Benjen (I don't think he is, but just saying), I could see that.
5023	alexislalas	2013-05-19	Yes, just pointed that in another thread, I think they can spare Coldhands and let Jojen or even Bran lead to where the three eye raven is.
@Ran: Nice theory that Coldhands could be Benjen. I really like it.
5024	Zman1863	2013-05-19	It's still pretty open. They'll have to explain how Sam gets by the wall in order to demonstrate how Bran and Co. get through, provided they do have them intersect. They still had the flock of ravens, and its hard to see the point of including it unless it had some sort of meaning.

I really like it.I'm pretty sure the thousand crows meant Coldhands would be coming.And if we met Coldhands this episode, that would mean Bran would go through the Wall during the finale, which would be his last ASOS chapter. If we meet Coldhands during the finale or the first or second episode next season Bran could go through the gate during the end of the season.
5026	baxter	2013-05-19	I don't quite recall the book, but what of this episode guaranteed no Coldhands?  Sam slays the walker in the book so I saw nothing there that says he can't meet up with him.

If we meet Coldhands during the finale or the first or second episode next season Bran could go through the gate during the end of the season.Bran is going to have a lot of added material, as we are likely not going to get to the end of aDWD until season Six. So, I imagine we are going to get a lot of backstory and history through Jojen helping Bran understand his green dreams. That's my theory at least. I don't see any other way of them introducing that stuff, which they have acknowledged is important to the story, they just have to present it at the right time so viewers don't get lost along the way.
5030	dtones520	2013-05-19	Plus, I think that the inclusion of the Ravens and them following Sam and Gilly will lead us to Coldhands.
5031	Broken Fox	2013-05-19	Man, I really hope we get to see Coldhands, and I also hope he turns out to be Benjen.
5032	BendTheKnee610	2013-05-19	I think we'll probably see him in one of the earlier scenes of the finale. Hope we get to see the scene where they are attacked by the wights.
5033	Garlan Marius	2013-05-19	Ravens on the weirwood?  I sense a warged wight in our future.

5035	kephv	2013-05-19	They could easily skip him entirely and give whatever magical role to Jojen.
5036	Logodnica	2013-05-19	Ravens on the weirwood?  I sense a warged wight in our future.I sense Bloodraven sending them to warn Sam and Gilly.  It would be VERY cool if they reveal that he was watching them and watching out for them

They're getting rid of an interesting character that adds a sense of intrigue into the magic beyond the wall in favour of giving a few actors some more lines.You never see his face, so he could really just be played by anybody.. I guess they feel like they can give a greater sense of purpose to the Reed's helping them journey beyond the wall if they remove Coldhands. They'll probably have a 'green dream' about the secret entrance, etc(blah).They're just slowly eliminating any wonder from the show.

Just to have more of the word "raven" repeated.
5039	Mr Smith	2013-05-20	I doubt they'll skip Coldhands, but I don't mind holding his introduction off till S4, particularly if it serves to flesh out Bran's storyline. Skipping him entirely would be a mistake, because Bran's journey north then loses credibility (they never would have survived without Coldhands).
5040	Master Forel's Fro	2013-05-20	I thought coldhands was the "old man" they meet was that just referring to the tree?
5041	The Meeraculous Third Reed	2013-05-20	Why did Sam leave the dagger behind?
Also, no Coldhands is lame. If only cos I want to see the Elk.
5042	Tony Soprano	2013-05-20	I though Coldhands had already been cast, but it turns out the guy that was rumored to play him was actually one of the Night's Watch mutineers. So, I guess we won't get Coldhands. /unsure.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':unsure:' />
I hope I'm wrong, though. I really like Coldhands, and I hope he'll show up in the next two episodes. It could be just a guest star. They don't need him for much, just to show Sam the way through the Wall.
5043	boojam	2013-05-20	So we won't see Coldhands until next season.  I'm strangely ok with that.  I assume they'll develop him on the journey with Bran.  Maybe have him meet Bran S4E5.Why is everybody so obsessed about Coldhands?!Does not even need to show up until Season 4.

5044	Necromancer	2013-05-20	In one of the trailers, we see Bran and his group facing a dark figure filling up the screen. I'd say it's pretty safe to assume that's Sam.
In her Thronecast interview Ellie Kendrick said that she and Hannah Murray (who were friends before they were on GOT) have a scene together this season. I'd say that Bran's last scene this season will be him reaching the Black Gate of the Nightfort and meeting Coldhands.
Since Coldhands is so vague and mysterious, they don't really need to cast an actor. They could just get a stuntman instead, maybe have someone else do his voice.
5045	Greywolf2375	2013-05-20	We might not, but seeing the ravens start to congregate made me think that atleast the chance for them to meet him is open.  As others have said, there are other ways for Sam to figure out the door.  Course, since we have also seen them walk through large doors cut into the base of the wall we might not even get that.
I'd like to see Coldhands, but the necessity of him being included isn't there.
5046	Stannis the Menace	2013-05-20	We might not, but seeing the ravens start to congregate made me think that atleast the chance for them to meet him is open.

Like someone said earlier, they would have never survived without coldhands.  and also they would not need to cast another actor, just make sure whoever 'plays' hims' identity is totally masked, so eliminating CH for cost purposes is not a valid argument IMO
5047	Tone	2013-05-20	I was so disappointed we didn't see him this episode! I was so excited to see how they would portray him and as soon as I saw the ravens I got all excited.
5048	Stannis the Menace	2013-05-20	we wont be seeing Oberyn, or any of the Martells for that matter, until next season

In addition to having Sam and Gilly rescued by Coldhands, I loved having Bran, et. al., 'figuratively rescued' by finally getting to the Wall and actually meeting Sam, since he's a NW who knew Jon.  /frown5.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':frown5:' />
5050	Where Boars Glow	2013-05-20	I sense Bloodraven sending them to warn Sam and Gilly.  It would be VERY cool if they reveal that he was watching them and watching out for themit could even be the pack of crows that plays the part of coldhands.
5051	Francis Buck	2013-05-20	I can't see them cutting Coldhands, at all. There's absolutely no reason for it whatsoever. On top of that, Bran's story needs as much content as it can get. There's very little material for him, and they need to stretch what's left over at least the next two seasons, at the absolute minimum. I think assuming that Coldhands is out just because he hasn't shown up yet is very much jumping the gun, similar to how everyone thought the Reeds were going to be cut because they didn't show up in season two (people were utterly convinced that he Reeds were cut, and they were already raging at the showrunners for it). Just give it time.
5052	WiDMNDBAMMD	2013-05-20	Bran is going to have a lot of added material, as we are likely not going to get to the end of aDWD until season Six.

I don't see any other way of them introducing that stuff, which they have acknowledged is important to the story, they just have to present it at the right time so viewers don't get lost along the way.Season 6? I really think they'll cover FFCs and DwDs in two seasons, hopefully half of next season and then season 5 covers most of DwD and FFCs. Also some storylines progress faster than others.For instance Bran reaches the Wall this season, which covers all his chapters from Storm of Swords, even though that book is covered this season and next.They need to show progress, which is why Bran reaches the Wall this season and it's probably why he'll reach the 3EC the end of next season.

5059	Payne24	2013-05-20	Haven't posted in years, been mostly just reading posts.
I believe people are jumping the gun with this Coldhands thing. Like many have said, there is NO REASON for sam and gilly to meet him as of episode 8. I am one of believe he will be in the show, this season or the next. I believe this was the beginning of his introduction. When we do actually see him, non-book readers will be able to put two and two together (hopefully) and realise that he was at least partially watching over sam and gilly.
Two reasons for this:
1- The huge ass flock of ravens. I believe this is foreshadowing and it will NOT be the last time we see said flock.
2- I don't know if any of you noticed, but they spent a lot of time (well more like a few seconds) zoomed into the face on the tree. It kinda gave me the feeling someone was looking at them through it (either coldhands or bloodraven). It just seemed to me that they spent a lot more time showing us the face on the tree than they should have if it won't be significant later on.
just my 2 cents /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
5060	Payne24	2013-05-20	Also, D&D could of had sam leave the dagger as foreshadowing for a later episode where he will meet more WW and have no weapon to kill them thus needing to be saved by a certain man with cold hands. *wink wink*
5061	stunningsteve	2013-05-20	Already suggested in another thread that they won't show Sam and CH meeting on-screen, but we will hear about it in the Nightfort, which certainly will be in E10 this season. Coldhands on-screen-debut would be E1 or E2 of next season while meeting up with Bran north of the wall.

5065	lannistergold	2013-05-20	Was I the only one who thought this thread would be about the Red Viper?
5066	Gendels Children	2013-05-21	im quite convinced we will see Sam and Gilly meet up with Bran and co before we meet ColdHands, Sam and Gilly will most likely make mention of him, saying that a strange man with coldhands saved them and helped them get through the wall, kinda like in the book, but im not sure we will have Sam and Gilly seeing him for the first time, we probably wont have Sam next ep at all.  So I think CH will make his appearance next season.
5067	Don Roberto	2013-05-21	As Sam will probably only appear again in the season finale, I see three possibilities:
1. Sam meeting Coldhands in ep 10 and that's it. Improbable, as it's not big enough an event for the finale.
2. Sam meeting Coldhands in the beginning of ep 10 and in the end, his scene with Bran. Maybe, but unlikely, as it would feel too rushed.
3. No Coldhands this season, Sam finds the Black Gate himself (either by accident or being "guided" by ravens) and we end with his scene with Bran. Probably what's going to happen, given what we know about the end of the season.
If Coldhands is not introduced this season, he could either be skipped entirely, or be the end of Bran's storyline next season. Given that s4 will be the rest of Storm of Swords and maybe a little bit of the other two books, technically Bran would disappear now and not reappear until s5. But the producers don't seem too fond of keeping big cast members away from the screen for entire seasons, so I'd wager that Bran will have part of his journey in s4. They could just make Jojen take him all the way and reach the Children's cave by s4's finale, but then what would they do with him the next two seasons? My bet is that in s4 Jojen will lead him north, but not really sure where to, or maybe to the wrong place (Hardhome?), and meet Coldhands by the end of it, and then resume Bran's journey in s5 more by-the-book.
5068	lostinasia	2013-05-21	it could even be the pack of crows that plays the part of coldhands.I was thinking this too, but that'd probably be more expensive than hiring an actor. Wouldn't be surprised at all however if the crows get Sam to the gate - but Coldhands will appear eventually.It's not as if the show hasn't already set a pattern of waiting a season before Bran's guides show up.
5069	conjo	2013-05-21	Maybe the final shot of the season will be of CH appearing at the Nightfort after Bran tells his ghost story..
5070	kevin1989	2013-05-22	Already suggested in another thread that they won't show Sam and CH meeting on-screen, but we will hear about it in the Nightfort, which certainly will be in E10 this season. Coldhands on-screen-debut would be E1 or E2 of next season while meeting up with Bran north of the wall.This would be great. But still we can have it as in the books. in episode 9 Sam can be saved from wights (they can easily use the people at the mutiny). Coldhands save them. We only see a hooded man no face with strange hands that saves them.
5071	AliKat	2013-05-22	Where the heck is Tommen the future king? He wasn't even at his uncle's wedding! I guess they wanted to save the expense of paying the actor but its kinda weird he'll be a big deal next season and he is absent this season. Even Rickon has been seen (although he barely speaks)
5072	Frumpus	2013-05-22	If Coldhands is cut then that's probably proof that he is not Benjen.Where the heck is Tommen the future king? He wasn't even at his uncle's wedding!

5073	silentwanderer	2013-05-22	If Coldhands is cut then that's probably proof that he is not Benjen.I still believe  Coldhands is going to be Benjen on  the show.Obviously not on the book, but it could be a cool plot twist for the show.
5074	Bannerless Man	2013-05-22	I do hope Coldhands makes it on to the show, whilst not MASSIVELY an important character he was definitely iconic, what with his elk-riding and all. Just hope he doesn't get cut and go the way of Belwas and Rakharo.
5075	pcad	2013-05-22	When the synopsis said, "Sam meets an old man", we all jumped to thinking Coldhands since he's described as having died long ago. 
What if the person proof reading the synopsis saw the words "cold man" and thought, gee, that's weird, they must have meant "old man". Stranger things have happened.
With "old man" it implies coldhands.  With "cold man" it's more ambiguous. It could be coldhands, or just as easily a WW or an Other. 
I think it was just a typo, but I believe in the tooth fairy too.

Coldhands on-screen-debut would be E1 or E2 of next season while meeting up with Bran north of the wall.I would agree with this except Sam and Gilly are in the recap of episode 8 which will be shown before episode 9, which means Sam and Gilly are in episode 9what are they going to do get a little bit closer to the wall? They been getting closer and closer to it for half a season now. I expect that the opening of episode 9 will lead off with them running through the woods from white walkers and wights and getting saved by Coldhands.

5077	Shadow on the Wall	2013-05-22	Coldhands is not a very satisfying character in the books. I was intrigued by him for a while only for him to turn out to be some random Night's Watchman from hundred years ago or w/e. Plausible - yes. Interesting - no.
So not bothered if they leave him out, but I expect the poster above me is right - he'll turn up in episode 9.

But ultimately I don't know how much it matters since Bran got to Bloodraven and that was basically the whole point of Coldhands.
5079	OrcusOfUndeath	2013-05-22	I think that Jojen knowing where they are going is quite a stretch. No one knows that Children of the Forest are even alive, let alone where they are. Its an even bigger stretch to have them survive beyond the Wall without Coldhands.
Or am I forgetting something?
And Coldhands should be kept if for nothing else, for his Cool Factor.

It is a very quick shot.I think the show is handling the mystical/magical reveals just right. And they have talked about warging several times this season.

Red viper is introducced shortly after tyrion's marriage if i recall correctly.

Not absolutely definitive, of course, but it would certainly hurt the Benjen is Coldhands theory.

The Dorne storyline is too large to introduce in the last two episodes - especially since the episode 9 is going to be mostly RW.

I think we get one more Sam/Gilly scene, most likely in 310.  My guess is we'll catch a glimpse of Coldhands.  I like the idea that he might come with Ghost- I feel like we won't see the giant elk for budgetary reasons. (The direwolves come and go but the elk would have to be there all the time)
5096	billy g.	2013-05-25	Man, I really hope we get to see Coldhands, and I also hope he turns out to be Benjen.Yeah, me too. But will D&D deviate that much from the books, when even after aDWD we still don't know who he is. /lol.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lol:' />
5097	silentwanderer	2013-05-26	I agree- Sam's "season" does not feel like it's over with the slaying.  The way I see it, Sam's season should not end until he finds Bran.In the books, Sam is the one who introduces Jon's little brother to Coldhands.It's his oath what opens the gate (Bran doesn't know the words). And the audience doesn't even know the Wall was spelled yet.

GOD DAMN THIS TELEVISION SHOW CHANGIN THINGS
5099	AliKat	2013-05-22	In the book, if I recall correctly, Sam did get some of the raven off to the Wall with warnings of the Others. But in the show, he didn't (as Mormont pointed out he had one job). During the White Walker scene, all of those birds were squawking. First of all - were those the ravens trained for sending messages or were they just regular crows, ravens, or black birds? I don't recall them being warning signs of the white walkers/others but I really liked it in the show because it made it supercreepy (partially because I loath birds lol). But if they are the trained ravens from the NW, were they looking for Sam because he was the one that was responsible for their care? I know Mormont's bird is partial to him then Jon Snow. I wasn't sure if these ravens were more like trained pets than wild birds so they went back to their 'owners'.
5100	conjo	2013-05-21	I'm loving how they're slowly making Cersei more and more paranoid around the Tyrells.. definately setting up for things to come and her own POVs probably for Season 5 onwards i would assume.
5101	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-20	Ummm, I really, really loved this little scene actually. I thought it was great.

5102	hollowcrown	2013-05-20	Joffrey is a Baratheon (or so he thinks). He hates the rumours of his mothers incest and staunchly insists Robert is his dad, even shaming Tywin in a small council meeting over doing so.
How comes in this episode he says he's going to put a Lannister baby in Sansa? He identifies as Baratheon, shouldn't he be saying he will put a Baratheon baby inside her?
Does show Joffrey know about the incest or even accept it?
5103	Mladen	2013-05-20	OK, this is continuation of the Discussing Sansa IIHere`s OP review of the Sansa scenes from previous thread, and the three last postsOP`s review of Sansa`s wedding and bedding.  Discussing Sansa this season was particularly hard, since we had no idea where the producers are heading with her character. It was a bit ambiguous what they wanted to achieve with her scenes, her characterization in this season. And now, after Sansa`s big scene came out, all doubts are gone. They were heading nowhere.  Executive producers of the show, D&D always made us remember that they are as big fans of the books as the most of us, but that show is separate entity. Well, I am now fully convinced. This episode showed us that even for D&D canon material means so little. The scenes I am talking about are in total collision with Martin`s envision of the wedding. But, where did it all began?  This entire season portrayed Sansa as the pawn in the game of real players <U+0080><U+0093> Littlefinger, QoT, Varys, and Tywin. She was just a beautiful girl with old name. And basically, they got that part well. The machinations, politics were the highlight of the season. But, where D&D epically failed is showing that one of two `windows` we see plots of King`s Landing is actually Sansa. How could they ever forget that is completely beyond my comprehension? The thing here isn`t Sansa`s position in the Game, we are all aware she is just a pawn. The problem is that her character lacked this season any serious depth or even layers that would make her at least more interesting. D&D`s imagination of Sansa is basically the same all male characters in the show have about her, and they have stipulated her to a `great beauty with old name`. You would think with dozen of POVs and several dozens of pages, GRRM wrote about her would make them think more deeply about her. And yet, they didn`t. Sansa was a sidekick this season and the worst part is, that her moment, the moment we knew is all about her was transformed into something else.  Sansa`s storyarc in this episode began when Tyrion visited her before the wedding. The awkward conversation was a nice touch, but it failed to show the real positions of the two characters. Tyrion led the conversation and basically made it all about him. It needed only one line: `I doubt that very much` to respond on Tyrion`s so-called empathy and to give us the right picture of that wedding. But then, again, they shifted the perspective from her to him. His line about not hurting her is interesting because he is supposed to be Prince Charming after Joffrey and Loras, and Sansa should be thankful for having him. We have been seeing this for quite some time. And although we all know how many wrong things are in this scene, we can`t deny that it fits perfectly with everything we have seen thus far.  The wedding ceremony began with interaction between Joffrey and Sansa. Those of us who read the books remember Sansa`s fierce respond to Joffrey`s statement that he is supposed to be her father in this matter. Again, Gods and D&D know why that respond was cut off. Funny or sad, you choose it, it seems that only score is depicting Sansa`s misery about this wedding. Ramin Djawadi did a great job here and filled the holes the writers <U+0080><U+0093> D&D left. Quietly, with dignity, accompanied with great music, Sansa walked down the aisle. And then, as we couldn`t predicted, Joffrey`s malice shifted again the spotlight from Sansa to Tyrion. It`s like we needed reminder that marrying a dwarf from family who destroyed your life is nothing comparing to marrying `great beauty with old name` and possibility to control half the realm. Here you have to congratulate the writers. They have done impossible. I honestly couldn`t believe it`s possible to feel sorry for Tyrion over Sansa in this marriage, but somehow that`s the impression I have during this wedding.  But where I totally wanted to shut down my screen is the kneeling part. Not kneeling in front of Tyrion, while knowing how hurtful it is for him was always one of the breakthrough moments for Sansa. Not seeing it, well we have all seen it coming, let`s face it. We knew there is no chance writers will give Sansa to show how harsh she can be, to truly position them on their right places. No, another chance and another scene were ruined, and it all leads to question: How many more will we have to see before Sansa`s character is truly lost.  And now quick derail for the ladies from PTP thread. Have you seen that dress? Every nerve of my body was on fire due to the wrong colors of the dress, lack of Stark maiden cloak, and general lack of symbolism in this wedding. It was weird ceremony, but one can argue it was meant to be.  Where the writers hit the cord was the feast and, not Sansa`s part of course, but the Tywin/Tyrion/Joffrey`s interaction. I liked it as much as I liked it in the books, and all three actors excelled here. The scene was both dramatic and interesting to see how the three great actors confront with their strong characters.  And now we come to weird part <U+0080><U+0093> the wedding night. Here again, the task was shared between writers and music department. While writers were focusing on Tyrion`s monologue, the music showed how hurtful this is for Sansa. The realization of her age finally puts the both of them under the light, and it`s incredibly wonderful to see how finally Tyrion gets some moral ambiguity this season. But, at the end he did the right thing. But, here Sansa just like in the books pushed the things further away. And then, one of the best part of tonight`s season. And now my watch begins. Sansa`s behavior in the books got the line here. Of course, it would all make much more sense, if Sansa was colder to Tyrion and showed him that she is a Stark of Winterfell, where winters are long and harsh. That way, the NW and the Wall reference would have its full meaning. The story ended with clean sheet and Shae realizing that things are not simple for either of them.  Whether you like it or not, the conversation we had the last time finally showed one thing. Producers love Tyrion, they are ready to make him far better and heroic, and they don`t mind whose character are they going to destroy. This entire episode was about Tyrion and his troubles of marrying Sansa and him doing the right thing. And although they are entitled to do that, I wish they didn`t behave like the high school fan boys who cheer for the best guy. Luckily for all of us, Djawadi`s music was beautifully composed and really cast a light on Sansa`s torments much more than actual text did.  To expect from the show what we had in books is unrealistic, and I am aware of that. But, we can here see how deep and meaningful GRRM`s writing is. We can see now that although he is man, he is sophisticated soul that can understand each and every of his character. And that`s something producers and writers of this episode miss. And that`s why the show will never reach the depth books have.POST FROM WOUTER:As I wrote in the Sansa and Tyrion thread, Sansa noticed that Joffrey took the footstool away, yet didn't kneel of her own volition. When Tyrion actually politiely asked her, she did. Not so terribly different from the books IMO.Sansa did show grace and strength in the way she held herself throughout the wedding, unlike Cersei who acted much like at the Blackwater again.POST FROM BBSTARK:It's not the same as showing defiance in a public place in front of everyone she hates and who are holding her prisoner.It's also not the same to have the wedding sprung on her the day of, instead of having all these people assure her just how GOOD Tyrion is. It's not the same that Sansa has so much interaction with Marg, who turns away from her in the books when she's married Tyrion, instead of encouraging her before... Sansa in the show is treated like a shallow and weak young girl, not the desperate young girl who is slowly becoming stronger every day while surviving in a completely hostile environment.  Her potrayal in the show is first and foremost as someone weak, and that's unfortunate.POST FROM JATYADO:The wedding scene is horrible!!! very horrible!! They didn't made Sansa kneel(which showcase her strength and I'm not even a fan) but they couldn't show this because they already show Sansa being a bitch about how she doesn't like Tyrion for being a dwarf.. And the whitewashing of Tyrion is getting into my nerves, he's looking more like a victim and they even had to make Joffrey take the bench so he could be more pitiable..  /mad.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':angry:' /> I still love the dark grey Tyrion in the books.. It's kinda disappointing because Peter Dinklage is such a good actor that I'm curious about how he would play Tyrion's dark side... this is such a horrible show change...[img]http://asoiaf.westeros.org/public/style_images/asoiaf/snapback.png[/img]gammaerys, on Yesterday, 08:37 PM, said:People hate us red hairs.

5104	Lemonhead	2013-05-20	Stannis mentions that he saw a great battle in the snow while he was looking into the fire. Which one is that? Him trying to re-capture Winterfell comes to mind, but I don't really see how that battle has any special significance. What do you thinnk?
5105	Mladen	2013-05-19	Hello again, welcome to the second edition of Discussing Sansa thread dedicated to the full comprehension of Sansa`s character in GoT TV showBefore I start, I would ask all those who haven`t read the books and who doesn`t want major spoilers to be revealed, to stop reading any further.The last thread, opened after episode 7 can be found here: [BOOK SPOILERS] Time to seriously discuss SansaOn the last thread, several questions have been raised and I`ll list them below:Sansa`s character suffered a great deal due to less important character. This discussion was the fiercest one. On one hand, several posters claimed that Sansa, as one of the major POV characters in ASOIAF deserves better treatment from producers and not to be equalized with unimportant characters like Talisa, Ros, Shae and Ygritte or even characters that hasn`t even appeared in SOS, like Theon. Furthermore, it was discussed whether Sansa`s chapters are just window to KL`s politics, or are they serving for something more. When producers decided to deepen many characters such as Joiffrey, Margaery, Olenna, it is a question how all those wonderful scenes GRRM has written for Sansa`s character are missing from the show.Forced vs. arranged marriages. Before anything and due to sensible nature of this question, I would ask all of you to restrain from any political messages and agendas. Also, I would also ask of you to be polite in regard of this matter. Sansa/Tyrion`s wedding that we have seen in this episode has been discussed for so long, further more we transferred the story from literature to politics analyzing forced vs. arranged marriages. And although our perspective is somewhat different on the matter, and we understand that neither of these marriages is completely done with consent of both parties, it is very important to make difference between arranging a marriage and forcing someone to marry.Male perspective on Sansa. If you ask anyone who is their favorite character on the show, and who is the star of it, you`ll have one answer <U+0080><U+0093> Tyrion. Due to brilliance of GRRM`s writing, enchanting charisma of Peter Dinklage and obviously great fondness of producers for the character, it became strange to watch how this marriage hurt Tyrion and not Sansa. Since everyone are talking about sacrifice Tyrion has to make to wed Sansa (strangely everyone have forgotten that she was the one losing everything and that Tyrion could only have benefited from this marriage.), one thing became certain. Producers have completely abandoned the given material aka ASOIAF and started a new form in which Tyrion practicly became Prince Charming of Westeros.Sophie Turner as Sansa. If almost all of us can agree upon one thing it is that young Miss Turner managed to do the best out of very little she was given, and that most of us agree she is perfect Sansa.Due to my residence, I`ll be watching the episode somewhat later, but I ask of you freely to start a debate over Sansa in this episode. Also, and please remember this, I`ll personally report each post that is offensive to anyone. If you can`t debate politely and on civilized way, than please stop discussing.For the end, the usual questions. What do you think of Sansa in this episode? Has the wedding and bedding lived up to their book counterpart and are you satisfied with how the things turned out to be for Sansa?P.S. My opinion will follow as soon as I watch the episode. Thanks for understanding.Here`s OP`s REVIEW OF SANSA`s WEDDING AND BEDDING

5106	sansatyrell	2013-05-19	I'm so so so so mad that they made Sansa kneel for Tyrion. It was HUGE in the books when she didn't. Honestly, it probably spared her even more hate from the fandom, because she'd have been called a bitch even more than she usually is, but still. I can't believe they made her kneel.
5107	RedBean	2013-05-19	So the one scene I was actually looking forward to, the one scene where Sansa finally has the guts let her feelings known about the wedding to everyone in proximity, is the one scene they decide to cut out. Excuse me while I go scream into my pillow.

5109	Greyjoy67	2013-05-19	Really, really not bothered by this change. 
Sorry purists. Sansa's feelings are pretty well established, I don't think her kneeling (eventually, I might add) is some kind of character assassination. Geez.
5110	Broken Fox	2013-05-19	I see zero difference between book Sansa and show Sansa.
5111	Greyjoy67	2013-05-19	I don't think it would have worked in the show. It just seems a really odd thing to be, I quote one poster, "livid" about .
5112	teemo	2013-05-19	Well....it was a way to help prevent fans from HATING Sansa for being mean to the series hero.  I think to compensate for not doing it the original way they didn't go to the extreme and have her happily kneeling.  The way they filmed it it seemed to me that Sansa wasn't even paying attention to Tyrion.  Like he was trying to do it and she didn't realize it (hence all the laughing) and then was like, "yeah whatever."  In the books it was more of an act of defiance.  I really liked that scene in the books, but plenty of viewers already loathe Sansa. And Tyrion is sooooooo whitewashed.  They really backed themselves into a corner.

5113	TNine	2013-05-19	They wrote themselves into a corner with that scene, by making Tyrion too sympathetic in general, and striving too hard to make Sansa's life as pleasant as possible.  They needed to either make it clear that Sansa's perspective was reasonable, make Tyrion a little less sympathetic to her, or make Sansa not kneel.
I'm happy that they have enough respect for Sansa as a character to make sure she doesn't come off as a huge bitch, even as i am sad that they aren't willing to adapt it to make her seem more defiant against Tyrion.  It surprises me, since she does flat out tell to Tyrion to die in the BotBW, but i can see them not willing to risk fan blowback.
5114	Garlan Marius	2013-05-19	So the one scene I was actually looking forward to, the one scene where Sansa finally has the guts let her feelings known about the wedding to everyone in proximity, is the one scene they decide to cut out. Excuse me while I go scream into my pillow.I'm no purist, but this is the one scene I needed to see as it was in the book.  What a terrible change.It wouldn't have made her seem so much like a bitch if they hadn't insisted on white-washing Tyrion so much that he hardly even resembles the character he is in the books.This as well.  I love me some book-Tyrion.  He's a beautifully-done grey character that one can empathize with but also condemn.  There's nothing about show-Tyrion that we can condemn; he's some unlikely hero, an avatar for the disadvantaged (perceived or not) to project themselves onto.  He needs his flaws.  He needs Singer Stew, which seems like the only saving grace for his characterization.
5115	sansatyrell	2013-05-19	I see zero difference between book Sansa and show Sansa.lol I mean, the kneel was a huge difference. thank god they still had her say "what if i never want you to" when tyrion said he wouldn't touch her until she wanted him too. /dry.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt='<_<' />
5116	piratesswoop	2013-05-19	I can't believe how much they've built Tyrion up as some perfect, ideal husband. Sansa smiling as she walked with him to the sept? Come on....
5117	Ran	2013-05-19	It's a bad change that again diminishes the character -- it took a great deal of guts to show even that much defiance -- but a direct consequence of their making Tyrion more of a heart-of-gold type. Shame.
5118	Dr. Pepper	2013-05-19	Ok, it's not so much Sansa that bothers me.  It's the characters around her.  She never would have kneeled, but there also wasn't a stool that was taken away moments before.  There is so much Tyrion whitewashing going on. 
I don't really have any cohorent comments.  I just found myself becoming a book purists for the very first time.  The entire wedding just rubbed me the wrong way.
5119	go joff go	2013-05-19	They just couldn't do it.  I liked that she didn't kneel but,  but people wouldn't have forgiven her.  And thats a fact since we have a legion of book fans who despise her.  GRRM never intended for her to receive the hate she did so I just can't get mad when they temper the things she did.  If she hadn't kneeled it would have looked like an FU to Tyrion not the Lannister.
5120	Greyjoy67	2013-05-19	I can't believe how much they've built Tyrion up as some perfect, ideal husband. Sansa smiling as she walked with him to the sept? Come on....I think you're exaggerating greatly. Perfect, ideal husband....... the guy gets drunk as fuck and is informed by Sansa that she'll probably never "want" him.Think a few people on here think they've turned him into Gandhi or something.
5121	Broken Fox	2013-05-19	lol I mean, the kneel was a huge difference. thank god they still had her say "what if i never want you to" when tyrion said he wouldn't touch her until she wanted him too. /dry.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt='<_<' />Like an earlier poster said her feelings towards the Lannisters are quite evident at this point. Not kneeling would just make her look like an asshole, especially after the conversations she's had with Tyrion. I get that that's a result of Tyrion getting whitewashed but whatever, I don't think it's that serious. Not kneeling doesn't make or break her character.

5123	Greyjoy67	2013-05-19	Yeah, that conversation with Margaery about how great a guy he is and how Sansa should be happy about the whole situation never happened.And the viewer should trust everything Margaery says amirite? It's just treating the viewers as stupid to assume that they just accept Tyrion as a "good guy". And if they are stupid enough, they'll be in for a nice few surprises next season anyway.

And if they are stupid enough, they'll be in for a nice few surprises next season anyway.Margaery voiced the same concerns the anti-Sansites on here have said about their marriage.  "He's so nice to you," "he's the best Lannister," etc.  That was frustrating that those opinions became part of the show canon.What "surprises?"  They aren't going to use Singer Stew, we'll know he doesn't kill his nephew, and his father is enough of a villain that kinslaying won't be seen as a "big deal."  He'll maintain his whitewashing as long as the writers can manage it.
5126	Lady Lea	2013-05-19	And the viewer should trust everything Margaery says amirite?It's just treating the viewers as stupid to assume that they just accept Tyrion as a "good guy".

And if they are stupid enough, they'll be in for a nice few surprises next season anyway.The thing is, they've only shown Tyrion as the good guy.  He hasn't has his bad guy moments like he did in the books.  The worst thing he's done in the show has been the slap Joffrey (and that doesn't exactly upset the audience) and keep silent about the incest and who pushed Bran.
5128	teemo	2013-05-19	Serious question...has Tyrion done anything in the series to date that makes him morally ambiguous rather than a hero?

The bastard slaughter, ordering Tyrion's death... They are kinda dubious in the books, but in the shows, it's all Joffrey, and Cersei is just one more of his victims. They also made Tywin some sort of great dad who sits with his child to teach him letters when even the maesters have washed their hands of him.The point is - All of the Lannisters are whitewashed to some point in this series. Tyrion more than others, yeah. But I abandoned any hope for book-faithfulness back then in early season 2.
5130	Garlan Marius	2013-05-19	Serious question...has Tyrion done anything in the series to date that makes him morally ambiguous rather than a hero?He frequents brothels and drinks a lot.  I guess he's about as morally ambiguous as a typical frat bro.

She is made to look bad because they are all whitewashed.  Save for Joffrey.  He's been given a villain mustache, basically.
5132	Minsc	2013-05-19	Serious question...has Tyrion done anything in the series to date that makes him morally ambiguous rather than a hero?He is not nice to Lancel is the only answer I have ever really received regarding this question.
5133	Winter's Knight	2013-05-19	Clearly D&D are TySan shippers. Ugh.
5134	Naathi Prince	2013-05-19	I knew they were going to have Sansa kneel when they had Tyrion ask her to out loud. Also they started with the stool already there and Joffrey taking it away, making it literally impossible otherwise. 
I also agree with those who have said that show Tyrion is just too likeable for that to have worked without people hating Sansa more. Its a shame, really, I'm sure all these bros who hate Sansa and love Tyrion would be thrilled to marry a woman who is usually drunk, noseless, and a dwarf all at the same time.
5135	Zman1863	2013-05-19	I didn't particularly love or hate the wedding/wedding night scenes.I thought the pre-ceremony Sansa/Tyrion scene was unnecessary. They could have used some of that time to preserve some of the dialogue that occurs in the wedding night scene, which I thought could have preserved without her having to get naked and risk legal complications. The cloak exchange has none of the weight it did in the book, but its yet another Sansa scene that depends so much on her inner thoughts for it to have its gravity. It's outwardly a scene that does make the reader sympathetic for Tyrion's feelings. But it's a lot harder to convey why the scene is important for her without doing what many fear, and making her look like an anti dwarf bitch. At least they shortened the moment so that wouldn't be all that came through. I just don't see how they could have done that scene   full justice.  I would be interested to see ideas on how it could have been done. I was struck by how Tyrion was quite intoxicated in the scenes. I didn't see him as so inebriated in the books. I personally thought it was bit over the top and took away from the dialogue. He frequents brothels and drinks a lot.  I guess he's about as morally ambiguous as a typical frat bro.Yeah and I think there might be a tendency to ignore those failings as minor vices.He is not nice to Lancel is the only answer I have ever really received regarding this question.Yup, that was me. It was threats and blackmail and cousin incest condoning in order to have a spy on his sister. "Not nice" is a bit tame to describe that. But yes, it I agree that its about the only act in the show besides the general intemperance and whoring that shows a dark side.
5136	Dr. Pepper	2013-05-19	Post deletedI can agree with this to an extent.  She's a bit more fleshed out than she was at this point in the books.  The thing is, if they are going to make these changes and adjustments for characters like Cersei or Tyrion or Tywin, it would make sense to adjust other characters as well, like Sansa.  One feels sorry for Sansa having to marry a Lannister, but not sorry that Sansa has to marry Tyrion because Tyrion is so nice and friendly.It's hard to explain and I'm sure someone else can do it better, but it's just not working for me.  I don't feel horror for Sansa the way I did in the books.  I am by no means a book purist, this is my first purist moment.  But not adjusting Sansa along with the other characters is just infuriating me.

5137	JonCon's Red Beard	2013-05-19	Post deletedbookCersei does have a soul, she deeply cares about her children and Jaime and the thought of losing them frightens her. The contrast of her character is how she treats everybody else and how she doesn't care. For example, she told Sansa that she would drag her to her wedding if needed: by doing that in the show, she would be seen as a real evil bitch mistreating poor Sansa.

5139	kephv	2013-05-19	Giving Tywin and Cersei each a soul doesn't mean they've been white washed, it just makes them more interesting.I disagree. The complete whitewashing of Tyrion has made him a lot less complex, a bit dull, and a lot more predictable (for one, It's easier to guess what he'll do next because it certainly isn't going to be anything morally questionable - always he'll be the white knight).

5140	RedBean	2013-05-19	Post DeletedYeah, but removing every bad thing Tyrion has done, and then having a completely unrelated character gush about how handsome and kind and "experienced" (because all men who have sex with whores are perfect lovers, apparently) he is definitely counts as whitewashing. Tywin at least got back into character in Season 3. Cersei was horrible in season 1. Tyrion, on the other hand, has remained the golden boy of GoT for all three seasons.Wow, six new replies as I typed this. This is quickly becoming one of the most popular threads for this episode.

Moreover, it is not like they portray him similar to Robert who was drunk all the time and had a ton of bastards from his whoring.
5143	shiola	2013-05-19	Sansa is one of my favorite book characters.  I haven't seen the episode yet, but having her kneel doesn't seem like such a big deal to me.  It would've been hard to get the complexity of it A. without narration, B. given the show's handling of Tyrion, and C. given the show's handling of Sansa.  So, in the context of the TV series' characterization, I think the change makes sense on paper.  Like I said, I've yet to see it.
5144	Naathi Prince	2013-05-19	They had souls, Dark, twisted ones, but they were there.

I would be interested to see ideas on how it could have been done.The septon made it clear that it symbolized Tyrion's ability to protect her.  He can't do that, and that was a huge part of the scene in the book.  The other part was the change-in-family, which definitely should have been played up more.  She hates him because he's a Lannister, not because he's a dwarf.

The ones before, tough, he was all "great, if a bit ruthless, patriarch".
5150	Minsc	2013-05-19	And even then, my friends thought it was funny when he manipulated Lancel.  Sigh.That is thing we only see Tyrion act un-nice to characters viewers already dislike and it is portrayed as not that big of a deal.
5151	Lord Damian	2013-05-19	I am actually greatful that they did not let Tyrion bang her on the tv show. . Sophie is a pretty good Sansa. Lets face it, Sansa is/was a little prat but is sympathetic later on. Tv makes Tyrion look more handsome than book Tyrion. In the Books, Tyrion is grotesque, even before the scar.

Self-determination, and all.  Show world should have some negative reactions to his behavior from someone other than Tywin, who is made out to be a villain, anyway.

Are any of those things bad ideas? The problem with Tywin has always been in the means and methods he has used, not necessarily in the ends he desires.

Especially, when they could go the Robert route and show how self-destructive those acts can be.

I mean, was anyone actually worried it would happen?
5156	Dr. Pepper	2013-05-19	Here's another of my problems with the wedding.  So much of it was about Cersei resisting the things going on around her instead of Sansa doing this.  Cersei is the Queen Regent, Sansa is a hostage but you'd hardly remember that in this episode.  What happened to the Sansa who told Joffrey that maybe her brother would bring her his head or the Sansa who wanted to push Joffrey off the ledge?  We've seen Sansa cry about this marriage and we've seen her talk about how he's a dwarf.  But she's still a hostage to a family who killed her father and is warring against her brother.  It's nice to see Cersei sharing barbs with Marg and Loras, but not at the expense of Sansa just going along meekly with all of this and not once quietly protesting.
5157	Lehnaru	2013-05-19	I'm pretty upset that they made Sansa kneel, though I'm sadly not surprised. They've set her character development back quite a bit.

Tyrion definitely is destroyed by drink, if ADWD is any indication.  Considering that the show glorifies prostitution (Littlefinger the master pimp) and has some minimum requirement for plot-unrelated nude scenes, that's never going to be seen as bad.
5159	Hedge Lawyer	2013-05-19	I'm pretty upset that they made Sansa kneel, though I'm sadly not surprised. They've set her character development back quite a bit.Sansa knelt in the book, too, but for the kiss.  The show just cut out the standing on Dontos part and the kiss, having her eventually kneel for the cloak ceremony (after the crowd started laughing at Tyrion).In the book: "When Sansa turned, the little man was gazing up at her, his mouth tight, his face as red as her cloak.  Suddenly she was ashamed of her stubbornness.  She smoothed her skirts and knelt in front of him, so their heads were on the same level."

I thought they were setting this up when she asks to be excused and gets up from the table, but instead they shuffle her off to have some conversation with Varys (at least that's what it looked like) and then Joffrey threatens her on the way back. Frustrating indeed, but given the incredible whitewashing of Tyrion, not surprising. I'm happy for the small things: her telling Tyrion that he can't understand how she feels, and later on when she makes clear she may never want to sleep with him.
5163	Florina Laufeyson	2013-05-19	Ok, it's not so much Sansa that bothers me.  It's the characters around her.

The whitewashing of Tyrion only mildly bothered me but now im pretty angry. It took away Sansa's silent defiance and man...most unhappy. Im usually pretty chill with changes even big ones, but this really small change was a really big one for me. I did NOT like it and and was ready to flip tables. Otherwise, i feel her characterization is going fine. She showed a lot of strength in the bedroom scene, but it doesnt make up for the kneeling. If it hadnt been for that seemingly minor change, the wedding itself would have been spectacular.
5164	wolverine	2013-05-19	he fondled her naked breasts tooYeah, he was much more a perv in the books as she was just laying there naked shivering and he was more than ready to do the deed, but realized how weird it was.

She showed a lot of strength in the bedroom scene, but it doesnt make up for the kneeling.I have to say that I did not catch the bedroom dialogue. I was still to upset about the kneeling and frankly I was uncomfortable with how far they would go and just couldn't keep focused even though I know legally that it wouldn't have been too far.  I'm glad for the defiance in the bedroom, but it feels a bit too little, too late.
5167	Bear Claw	2013-05-19	I don't understand her age.  I thought she was 16 by now.  Is Rob 18?  Bran doesn't look at all 10. I think they really shouldn't bring it up on the show because it doesn't make sense.
5168	wolverine	2013-05-19	I don't understand her age.  I thought she was 16 by now.  Is Rob 18?  Bran doesn't look at all 10. I think they really shouldn't bring it up on the show because it doesn't make sense.I agree.  I thought they were aged up for the show too.
5169	Lady Lea	2013-05-19	Well she is 12 in the books during this scene so they did age her up a bit. Any more and the scene would have lost a lot of its impact.
5170	Florina Laufeyson	2013-05-19	Sophie Turner is 17. But having Sansa as 14 is a little off due to how tall and grown up she looks. Making her 16 would have been ok.
5171	Lady Lea	2013-05-19	Sophie Turner is 17. But having Sansa as 14 is a little off due to how tall and grown up she looks. Making her 16 would have been ok.she would have been too old to be referred to as a child though.16 is legal in most countries. It would diminish the creepiness of the scene and further LF scenes imo
5172	JonCon's Red Beard	2013-05-19	My problem with the scene was that Sansa looked more pleased about it than she should be, as though she just realised that she was very lucky she was marrying the best Lannister and she should be grateful for that. Her situation in the show is pretty much "unless is not Joffrey" when in books it's more like "it could be worst but is still pretty bad", she has accepted, but she's miserable, everybody notices that, even Tyrion himself who later has no idea how to please her, nor even make her smile for a moment.
Many people complains that Sansa is not a "real Stark" but during her wedding, she does behave as a Stark as well as a Tully. She knows she can't escape, as Cersei pointed out, they would take her by force if needed, so, she decides she would act honorably about it by going willingly instead of being dragged or cry but always showing that she was only doing it because it was her duty, not her pleasure, and that's why she doesn't bend the knee not help his husband in any way to put the cloack on her, she's giving him, and by implication all the Lannisters, a "I don't f care how you manage to do this, I won't move a muscle" attitude.
This episode didn't give me that impression. They portray Sansa as though she had accepted that she was marrying the best Lannister and she had no problem about it: but of course she had a problem, he was a Lannister. Accepting that marrying a Lannister wasn't "that bad" was accepting that she was in good terms with the family that cut her father's head and were in war with her brother. Didn't Dany implied that things that don't break eventually break? In Sansa's situation, bending would be the proof that the Lannister finally broke her down.

5173	The Unholy Reaver	2013-05-19	If, drug lord and serial killer can be protagonist, why not Tyrion? it is totally ruining Tyrion - the character.
5174	Fragile Bird	2013-05-19	I am actually greatful that they did not let Tyrion bang her on the tv show. . Sophie is a pretty good Sansa. Lets face it, Sansa is/was a little prat but is sympathetic later on. Tv makes Tyrion look more handsome than book Tyrion. In the Books, Tyrion is grotesque, even before the scar.People who didn't read the books maybe.He doesn't have sex with her though, but she goes as far as take off her clothes and get on the bed, with Tyrion next to her. IICR, Tyrion does watch her naked. Now, he stopped her at time.Tyrion asks Sansa how old she is, and she says 14.  To show on tv what would amount to child molestation simply is not going to happen.  GRRM can do it in a book, but I'm sure the episode would be attacked if they purported to show a naked 14 year old about to have sex with an older man, married or not.  Especially this marriage.
5175	Kasrith	2013-05-19	I'm so so so so mad that they made Sansa kneel for Tyrion. It was HUGE in the books when she didn't. Honestly, it probably spared her even more hate from the fandom, because she'd have been called a bitch even more than she usually is, but still. I can't believe they made her kneel.I was kinda expecting her to kneel before he had to ask her. Would have tied into the show nicely, after Tyrion is ridiculed by everyone she's kinda understanding and kneels to help him. Cliche or not, would have been a nice fit for the show's progression.
5176	Zman1863	2013-05-19	Sophie Turner is 17. But having Sansa as 14 is a little off due to how tall and grown up she looks. Making her 16 would have been ok.They kept Sansa's story pretty much on course as far as age goes. Sophie Turner is seems obviously older than fourteen, but in show time the character had her first menstruation  within the last few months. Under the laws of a few countries it's illegal to portray certain sexual situations even if the actress is of legal age if the character is not. They might as well say she's younger if they say otherwise anyway.
5177	SerMixalot	2013-05-19	just another missed opportunity
5178	RedBean	2013-05-19	Sophie Turner is 17. But having Sansa as 14 is a little off due to how tall and grown up she looks. Making her 16 would have been ok.I think it's because we saw her 'flower' only last season, so it makes sense that she's pretty young. Highborn girls usually flowered early, even in medievial times. To make Sansa 16 might not have worked in the context, though the actress does look 16/17.I was kinda expecting her to kneel before he had to ask her. Would have tied into the show nicely, after Tyrion is ridiculed by everyone she's kinda understanding and kneels to help him. Cliche or not, would have been a nice fit for the show's progression.Doesn't really help Sansa's characterization much, though. There isn't much reason she should be pleased about marrying a Lannister, not when her family was destroyed by Lannisters.

5179	JonCon's Red Beard	2013-05-19	Tyrion asks Sansa how old she is, and she says 14.  To show on tv what would amount to child molestation simply is not going to happen.  GRRM can do it in a book, but I'm sure the episode would be attacked if they purported to show a naked 14 year old about to have sex with an older man, married or not.  Especially this marriage.But many have no problem pairing Arya and Gendry, and Arya is way younger than Sansa, nor one of Dany's handmaids saying that she didn't touch a man until she was 12 years old.I have no problem with how they develop the scene, though.
5180	ebevan91	2013-05-19	I'm so confused when it comes to ages of characters.
Robb in the books is only what, 2 and a half to 3 years older than Sansa, yet on the show, he looks a lot older than 16 and a half or 17 years old.
Hell, Bran looks like he's 14 or 15 years old on the show.
5181	Mendoza	2013-05-19	I just think here, her pov was more with Marg, who counciled her to be a good wife and do her duty. That's it.
Thus, all of Tyrion's interactions are more with his f'ed up family and of course, he's too much of a dwarf-Ned to actually lust after Sansa or the claim to the North. So, he's a paper thin white knight character who belongs in those Lord of the Rings knockoffs George always makes fun of and the Sansa pov is totally muted.
Great tv? As much as the actors can bring. If you like Peter being drunk, its great.
5182	lostinwesteros	2013-05-19	I thought Sansa played this episode perfectly.  The writing for her part was great, and I thought the kneeling was done well.  Seems most of the posters on this thread liked that Sansa didn't kneel in the book and didn't want her to in the HBO series, but that was actually one part in the book that made me dislike Sansa for a time there, so I'm glad HBO handled it the way they did.  Even without that, Joff had taken the step stool away, so what else were either of them to do?  Have Sansa stand there forever with Tyrion jumping up and down to get the cape over her shoulders?    There was no Dontos for Tyrion to use as a footstool.
5183	Zman1863	2013-05-19	But many have no problem pairing Arya and Gendry, and Arya is way younger than Sansa, nor one of Dany's handmaids saying that she didn't touch a man until she was 12 years old.I have no problem with how they develop the scene, though.People don't have any problem pairing Arya and Gendry because there is nothing explicit there at all. Anything the text refers to on that end is implied and mere potential. The Sansa/Tyrion wedding night is too explicit to show in some countries based on how old she is as a character regardless of how old Turner is.
5184	RedBean	2013-05-19	I really wish they'd shown more of her during the wedding scene, rather than cut to unrelated characters like Cersei and Marg (sorry, I love Margaery, but this scene was Sansa's). The scene in the books was written from Sansa's POV. They should have made her central during the whole wedding.
I'd scream if the RW was going to be from Talisa's POV and not Cat's.
5185	Dr. Pepper	2013-05-19	I'm so confused when it comes to ages of characters.Robb in the books is only what, 2 and a half to 3 years older than Sansa, yet on the show, he looks a lot older than 16 and a half or 17 years old.Hell, Bran looks like he's 14 or 15 years old on the show.With the kids, it's not something that can be helped all that much.  In a book, you can stall the passage of time.  Not really possible in real life.  When a year between each season, the kids are going to grow.  Hell, Rickon ages several months just between scenes. The adult actors is another story.  Some of them are bizarre, like Richard Madden who does not look like a youth.  Or Natalie Dormer who doesn't look a day under 30.  That will be bizarre if/when she marries Tommen.
5186	Florina Laufeyson	2013-05-19	My mum actually let out an "omg" when Sansa said she was 14. So yeah it kinda bends your suspension of disbelief. Oh well. Sophie Turner is also unusually tall. (shes like what, 6'2" or some crazy shit?)

That will be bizarre if/when she marries Tommen.This is one of the reasons I initially wanted a younger actress to portray Margaery. But I guess they really needed someone experienced to play the character in the direction they were taking her. Still, it's going to seem pretty creepy when she marries him. Both the younger Lannister kids looked really young in Seasons 1 and 2. I don't think they'd have grown much by Season 4.
5188	The Scabbard Of the Morning	2013-05-19	My mum actually let out an "omg" when Sansa said she was 14. So yeah it kinda bends your suspension of disbelief. Oh well. Sophie Turner is also unusually tall. (shes like what, 6'2" or some crazy shit?)She's 5'9, maybe pushing 5'10.
5189	BurningCandle	2013-05-19	In my brain I always thought it would go easier on Sansa if she kneeled, but at the same time was proud of her for not doing so.
Even though I've thought so far that Tyrion was not really white washed to much (appart from the details they left out with Tysha) I'm really shocked they made her kneel. That was a big deal in the books.
Makes me wonder if they know something we don't about how Tyrion ends up, because by Dance of Dragons he's really messed up and not a good guy at all.
I'm shocked that I'm finding myself agreeing with people on the white washing now. The kneel shouldn't have happened. Of course, I understand why they did it, but...no. Just shouldn't have happened.
5190	Bear Claw	2013-05-19	Well, they could have worked in her  young age by Tyrion glancing around the room and seeing her doll (that Ned gave her) that would have indicated to the audience that yes she is a child.  Saying 14 definitely took me out of the story (as Fiona Stark said- suspension of disbelief).
5191	Fragile Bird	2013-05-19	But many have no problem pairing Arya and Gendry, and Arya is way younger than Sansa, nor one of Dany's handmaids saying that she didn't touch a man until she was 12 years old.I have no problem with how they develop the scene, though.I didn't see a scene with Arya and Gendry naked in bed.  I must have missed it.  Which episode was it in?  What chapter of which book?
5192	Florina Laufeyson	2013-05-19	She's 5'9, maybe pushing 5'10.Im 5'9" and im pretty sure Miss Turner would tower over me. :/Oh, hey, thanks for bringing up the doll. I noticed it and my heart hurt. Awww...
5193	RedBean	2013-05-19	Well, they could have worked in her  young age by Tyrion glancing around the room and seeing her doll (that Ned gave her) that would have indicated to the audience that yes she is a child.  Saying 14 definitely took me out of the story (as Fiona Stark said- suspension of disbelief).Chekhov's doll? /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' /> They already used it in the Blackwater scene, though. Still, I guess they could have aged her up a couple of years if they really had to.
5194	ebevan91	2013-05-19	So I wonder how old Bran and Arya are.
Cause in season 1 Bran is 10, and assuming he's a year older, 11 now. Maybe 12 if his birthday is early in the year and has already passed. That would make Arya 13 because she's only a year younger than Sansa IIRC. Which 13 for Arya seems about right but next season she'll probably look like she's 17 or 18.

Lets face it, Sansa is/was a little prat but is sympathetic later on. Tv makes Tyrion look more handsome than book Tyrion. In the Books, Tyrion is grotesque, even before the scar.He took out his peen too in the books but the actual Sansa actress is a minor and that would be statutory rape and child pornography irl and everyone on that set would be in federal prison right now.

5201	PhoenixFlame	2013-05-20	How long does this 17 / 10 years thing go for? Just curious, haha.
5202	Mladen	2013-05-20	OK, I have watched the episode two hours ago, and I am finally ready to give you piece of my mind in the shape of my very own review oif the Sansa scenes. I hope you`ll find it interesting and I hope it`ll give you something to think about.I would also like to thanks Dr Pepper and brashcandy for taking my place and starting a great conversation on the thread. Friends like they are are very rare and I am so happy they helped me in this way. Again, ladies, thank you. And here we go:OP`s review of Sansa`s wedding and bedding.		  Discussing Sansa this season was particularly hard, since we had no idea where the producers are heading with her character. It was a bit ambiguous what they wanted to achieve with her scenes, her characterization in this season. And now, after Sansa`s big scene came out, all doubts are gone. They were heading nowhere.		  Executive producers of the show, D&D always made us remember that they are as big fans of the books as the most of us, but that show is separate entity. Well, I am now fully convinced. This episode showed us that even for D&D canon material means so little. The scenes I am talking about are in total collision with Martin`s envision of the wedding. But, where did it all began?		  This entire season portrayed Sansa as the pawn in the game of real players <U+0080><U+0093> Littlefinger, QoT, Varys, and Tywin. She was just a beautiful girl with old name. And basically, they got that part well. The machinations, politics were the highlight of the season. But, where D&D epically failed is showing that one of two `windows` we see plots of King`s Landing is actually Sansa. How could they ever forget that is completely beyond my comprehension? The thing here isn`t Sansa`s position in the Game, we are all aware she is just a pawn. The problem is that her character lacked this season any serious depth or even layers that would make her at least more interesting. D&D`s imagination of Sansa is basically the same all male characters in the show have about her, and they have stipulated her to a `great beauty with old name`. You would think with dozen of POVs and several dozens of pages, GRRM wrote about her would make them think more deeply about her. And yet, they didn`t. Sansa was a sidekick this season and the worst part is, that her moment, the moment we knew is all about her was transformed into something else.		  Sansa`s storyarc in this episode began when Tyrion visited her before the wedding. The awkward conversation was a nice touch, but it failed to show the real positions of the two characters. Tyrion led the conversation and basically made it all about him. It needed only one line: `I doubt that very much` to respond on Tyrion`s so-called empathy and to give us the right picture of that wedding. But then, again, they shifted the perspective from her to him. His line about not hurting her is interesting because he is supposed to be Prince Charming after Joffrey and Loras, and Sansa should be thankful for having him. We have been seeing this for quite some time. And although we all know how many wrong things are in this scene, we can`t deny that it fits perfectly with everything we have seen thus far.		  The wedding ceremony began with interaction between Joffrey and Sansa. Those of us who read the books remember Sansa`s fierce respond to Joffrey`s statement that he is supposed to be her father in this matter. Again, Gods and D&D know why that respond was cut off. Funny or sad, you choose it, it seems that only score is depicting Sansa`s misery about this wedding. Ramin Djawadi did a great job here and filled the holes the writers <U+0080><U+0093> D&D left. Quietly, with dignity, accompanied with great music, Sansa walked down the aisle. And then, as we couldn`t predicted, Joffrey`s malice shifted again the spotlight from Sansa to Tyrion. It`s like we needed reminder that marrying a dwarf from family who destroyed your life is nothing comparing to marrying `great beauty with old name` and possibility to control half the realm. Here you have to congratulate the writers. They have done impossible. I honestly couldn`t believe it`s possible to feel sorry for Tyrion over Sansa in this marriage, but somehow that`s the impression I have during this wedding.		  But where I totally wanted to shut down my screen is the kneeling part. Not kneeling in front of Tyrion, while knowing how hurtful it is for him was always one of the breakthrough moments for Sansa. Not seeing it, well we have all seen it coming, let`s face it. We knew there is no chance writers will give Sansa to show how harsh she can be, to truly position them on their right places. No, another chance and another scene were ruined, and it all leads to question: How many more will we have to see before Sansa`s character is truly lost.		  And now quick derail for the ladies from PTP thread. Have you seen that dress? Every nerve of my body was on fire due to the wrong colors of the dress, lack of Stark maiden cloak, and general lack of symbolism in this wedding. It was weird ceremony, but one can argue it was meant to be.		  Where the writers hit the cord was the feast and, not Sansa`s part of course, but the Tywin/Tyrion/Joffrey`s interaction. I liked it as much as I liked it in the books, and all three actors excelled here. The scene was both dramatic and interesting to see how the three great actors confront with their strong characters.		  And now we come to weird part <U+0080><U+0093> the wedding night. Here again, the task was shared between writers and music department. While writers were focusing on Tyrion`s monologue, the music showed how hurtful this is for Sansa. The realization of her age finally puts the both of them under the light, and it`s incredibly wonderful to see how finally Tyrion gets some moral ambiguity this season. But, at the end he did the right thing. But, here Sansa just like in the books pushed the things further away. And then, one of the best part of tonight`s season. And now my watch begins. Sansa`s behavior in the books got the line here. Of course, it would all make much more sense, if Sansa was colder to Tyrion and showed him that she is a Stark of Winterfell, where winters are long and harsh. That way, the NW and the Wall reference would have its full meaning. The story ended with clean sheet and Shae realizing that things are not simple for either of them.		  Whether you like it or not, the conversation we had the last time finally showed one thing. Producers love Tyrion, they are ready to make him far better and heroic, and they don`t mind whose character are they going to destroy. This entire episode was about Tyrion and his troubles of marrying Sansa and him doing the right thing. And although they are entitled to do that, I wish they didn`t behave like the high school fan boys who cheer for the best guy. Luckily for all of us, Djawadi`s music was beautifully composed and really cast a light on Sansa`s torments much more than actual text did.		  To expect from the show what we had in books is unrealistic, and I am aware of that. But, we can here see how deep and meaningful GRRM`s writing is. We can see now that although he is man, he is sophisticated soul that can understand each and every of his character. And that`s something producers and writers of this episode miss. And that`s why the show will never reach the depth books have.
5203	ohpooratlas	2013-05-20	I remember when the original thread was started people were whining about how childish and immature Sansa was being when she said she did not want to marry Tyrion because he was a dwarf.
And now people are whining because she kneeled.
We can't have it both ways.  I'm okay with Sansa being a little empathtic towards Tyrion (I think that actually shows a growth in maturity.)  At the same time she still asks what if she never wantst to bed him, so she hasn't been completely changed.
I for one did not want to see Sansa throw a temper tantrum during her wedding.
Also: Sansa not kneeling has nothing to do with the white washing of Tyron's character.  It's an act she does, not him.
I actually think that the fact that Tyrion got so obnoxiously drunk at his wedding and embaressed both himself and his wife was a wonderful way of reminding us that he's still immature and horrible at confrontation when it comes to his family.
The only thing I was bummed about was the fact that we didn't get the "in the dark I'm the Knight of Flowers" line but I understand they probably witheld it due to Sansa's age in the show.

It's an act she does, not him.But, the kneeling wasn`t just that. It was clear demonstration of who she is, and how much of Stark blood is in her. If it was just for the sake of empathy or the wedding, I would say: OK, not big deal. But this was also about her identity and her unwillingness to bend the knee to LannistersAs for white washing, they did different thing today. They completely shifted the objective from her to him. And that`s even worse.
5205	Minsc	2013-05-20	Part of me in now wondering how are they going to successfully explain and portray her running away with Littlefinger, seeing how they have absolutely diminished the threat she faces in staying with Tyrion while greatly overplaying the danger of Littlefinger thus making her choice to side with LF look like an extremely idiotic move.
Moreover, I wonder how are they going to handle the Jaime and Brienne plot seeing how there is no way those two aren't going to get to King's Landing before the Purple Wedding how are they going to explain that.  In how will Jaime be able to reasonably agree to leave Sansa a prisoner in King's Landing if he actually has the possibility to rescue her before she runs away?

5207	Newstar	2013-05-20	The funny thing about the wedding/wedding feast/wedding night sequence was that it was significantly toned down from the books in several respects that I need not list here since we all know exactly what they are, and it was still excruciating to watch.The fannish gnashing of teeth over Sansa's kneeling--pretty much every second post in the Tumblr Sansa Stark tag is capslock rage over the kneeling--is kind of bizarre to me, since she knelt in the books for the kiss, if not for the cloak exchange (and we didn't see the kiss in the show, so the kneeling for the cloak exchange effectively compressed the two events), and since she didn't kneel immediately in the show and did so only when asked by Tyrion (similar to her caving and kneeling for the kiss when she pitied Tyrion). There's a difference, but I think it's one of degree and not of kind.Hilariously, the Sansa fans on Tumblr and elsewhere have been wringing their hands in worry over the past, oh, year or so that TV viewers will hate Sansa because of all things related to the Tyrion marriage, and yet when the TV writing deliberately writes Sansa in a more sympathetic light in the show, by writing her as kneeling when asked and essentially "transferring" the intent to hurt and humiliate Tyrion to Joffrey (who nabs Tyrion's footstool), thereby eliminating the single most controversial and hated action of Sansa's in relation to the marriage to Tyrion, these same Sansa fans scream bloody murder. It makes no sense to me whatsoever.I also stated on the episode thread that there was no way TV Sansa could have refused to kneel for Tyrion--and held to that refusal--without coming off as a dick, and the writers were well aware of that fact. She wouldn't have appeared gloriously defiant; she would have looked cruel.they have absolutely diminished the threat she faces in staying with TyrionWell, the writers did have Joffrey issue an explicit standing rape threat and indicate he'd be more than willing to father a Lannister heir on her. Even though Tyrion (with an assist from Tywin) deterred Joffrey from going through with the bedding, the message was clear that Tyrion couldn't really do anything to protect Sansa from Joffrey. That's reason enough for Sansa to get the hell out of dodge.thus making her choice to side with LF look like an extremely idiotic move.It's only idiotic if she has knowledge of LF's dangerous side and nefarious deeds and goes with him anyway, but no one's warned her that Littlefinger is a bad person and she has no evidence (acquired firsthand or otherwise) of her own to form a basis for that belief. On the basis of the knowledge she has, there's nothing idiotic about siding with Littlefinger.His line about not hurting her is interesting because he is supposed to be Prince Charming after Joffrey and Loras, and Sansa should be thankful for having him.Eh, I dunno. Couldn't you equally view it as a transposed, modified version of his line to her in A Clash of Kings, where he told her that he vowed not to savage her? He squeezed her arm (hand?) at that time in ACOK, much as he took her hand when he said this line in this episode.

Simply, they have overly played up Petyr Whiplash thus any siding with him over the clearly non-threatening Tyrion will just make her look even stupider to audiences similar to how they treated the Loras Match.Moreover, correct me if I am wrong but doesn't Shae warn Sansa of the danger that Littlefinger poses?

It makes no sense to me whatsoever.It makes perfect sense, because Sansa has no reason to kneel for Tyrion, who is her enemy, and marrying against her will, and the people who think that's controversial are sexist idiots who think Sansa should be pleased as punch to marry into the Lannister Clan.

5215	Newstar	2013-05-20	Seems like amble argument to me, especially when reading many of those individuals continue on with their attacks on her for not loving him.Colonel Green's statement about all those who take issue with or dislike Sansa's refusal to kneel being sexist idiots who think Sansa should be happy to be marrying a Lannister, isn't in fact "ample" argument--it's an assertion I think is utterly nonsensical strawmanning, and I think throwing around blanket accusations of sexism (sexist idiocy, no less) for no other reason than the accused happen to hold different views is highly questionable--but I won't get into that more at the risk of derailing the thread.All I wanted to point out is that it seems a little rich to me that the TV writers have gone out of their way in this one respect to make Sansa more sympathetic, which is what Sansa fans seemed to want and worry about, and there's been this huge backlash over Sansa's refusal to kneel. Does not compute. The pearl-clutching on Tumblr about how the writers' attempt to avoid making Sansa look like a dick during the wedding has ruined her character is pretty funny, though.That is still a greater threat then it will seems that she will likely face from Tyrion.Well, just as in the books, all she has is Tyrion's word that he won't consummate the marriage unless she wants him to do so. I don't think that the fact that he seems to be taking the "sharing the bed" part literally in the TV show--exiling himself to the couch--really makes much of a difference for Sansa in trusting that he won't rape her. It's still basically nothing more than his word.

5217	Lucifer Lightbringer	2013-05-20	I have high hopes that Sansa's character will develop quite rapidly once she is out of King's Landing. I do agree that she hasn't had enough characterization in the show so far - she is more or less a place holder for the role she will take on later in the series.
A lot of her chapters in the books were necessarily focused on her inner thoughts and feelings because of how alone she was, and how restricted she was in her movements and expressions. She couldn't really have done very much and gotten away with it.
I am definitely kind of sad that they simplified her wedding to Tyrion so much by making him such a nice guy. Having her kneel in this episode was totally necessary; it wouldn't have made much sense for her not to, as a consequence of the changes they've made. Still, at this point in the books she was carefully protecting herself and biding her time until she could escape, and she was very cut off from everyone. That isn't showing through right now.
Once we get to see her outside of King's Landing I hope that they give her character a little more expression, and we can see how she begins to 'grow up' a little bit and develop under Little Finger's grooming to become a major player in the Game of Thrones, because I think that that is what she is destined for. She's gonna be a big thing.
5218	nirolo	2013-05-20	they have absolutely diminished the threat she faces in staying with Tyrion while greatly overplaying the danger of Littlefinger thus making her choice to side with LF look like an extremely idiotic move.Well, the writers did have Joffrey issue an explicit standing rape threat and indicate he'd be more than willing to father a Lannister heir on her.

The emphasis is on the "staying".Rather than keep on addressing the threat of "staying with Tyrion" in your reply, you shift your argument to the threat she will likely face "from Tyrion", which is not the assertion made in your original statement. You need to stop shifting the debate. Seriously.There is quite a difference between threats resulting from "staying with Tyrion" v. threats resulting "from Tyrion."

5219	Mendoza	2013-05-20	They removed her inner Stark Strength in refusing to knell to prop drawf-Ned. It didn't make her sympathetic. She isn't even presented as a character here. Its just the a story about Tyrion and his family. The demands his evil father makes on him, the cruelty of his evil nephew. The bravery he has in protecting his bride. drawf-Ned is presented as an ideal, while Sansa is used as a prop. There is no Stark point of view, therefore, Sansa can not be seen either sympathetic or unsympathetic. It's not about her and we're not meant to have an opinion one way or another in this tv adaption.

Something, that is not all that different from LF offering to help her escape KL with him in order to go back to the Vale.Only, there isn't any sense of sexual threat from Tyrion.  While, in contrast LF is treated like Snidely Whiplash thus everyone will expect him to abuse and mistreat her.

This isn`t about being likeable. This is about presentig her as it should, as she is. Sansa can be both sympathetic and she can refused to bend the knee, it`s all the way how you do it. But, when you creat of Tyrion some great hero, protector of the weak, than you have problems with every action done against him.I don`t know what`s said on Tumblr, and please leave it there, and have discussion here with us resonding to our arguments. Sansa`s refusal to bend the knee was the demonstration of who she is, powerful sign of how strong she is. And if producers didn`t make Tyrion even more likeable, I would think there were a decent chance for Sansa to do both - to be sympathetic and not to bend the knee.
5222	Winter's Knight	2013-05-20	It is called I don't use the same wording for every sentence I write even when addressing the same point so get over it.  The issue is by staying with Tyrion I was referring to the threats she faces from Tyrion, in how I doubt the show will have Tyrion talking with Bronn about how much he wants to rape Sansa.Therefore, there will not be a feeling that he might one day decide to rape her.  While, in contrast LF is treated like Snidely Whiplash thus everyone will expect him to abuse and mistreat her.  Moreover, Shae has already warned Sansa that he poses the same threat that Tyrion might poses against her that of a desire for sex.Oh gods, then when he starts molesting her, everyone'll be all "serves her right for abandoning Tyrion".
5223	PatrickStormborn	2013-05-20	Why should Sansa's agency have been stripped away from her, just so that idiots don't hate her for it? Because honestly, if you hate a 12/14 year old girl for not kneeling for a man she was forced to marry, then you're nothing more than an idiot.

5225	Woman of War	2013-05-20	I'm no purist, but this is the one scene I needed to see as it was in the book.  What a terrible change.Though I would not use the term "terrible" I as well have small  odds with Sansa not kneeling, not only for the sake of the Sansa character but for Tyrion's as well. The whole awkwardness of Tyrion's marriage to Sansa and of the person Tyrion in the eyes of others, of the courtiers and nobles was condensed in this scene whenTyrion had to climb the fool in order to put the cloak around Sansa's shoulders. The onlookers had little trouble with Sansa being married that way since this was more or less what awaited  noble girls, there was little pity for Sansa from the wedding guests. And why should she get any pity from the girl who had to marry Joffrey , rhetorical question. So this scene described perfectly well what Tyrion was in the eyes of his surroundings: a ridiculous fool.Now from Sansa's viewpoint: i liked her very much when she did not kneel in the books. This was an act of defiance that had to be done. But in the books Sansa is twelve while in the series she is fifteen or so. So there should be expected some strategic thinking. She should be aware that Tyrion and her have the common interest of surviving Joffrey's cruelty and madness. So antagonizing Tyrion in public may not have been reasonable for older HBO Sansa, while the same way of longterm thinking cannot be expected form a twelve year old child, her touch of defiance was in line with age and character and the girl trying to emulate a lady and regretting this later was in line too. So I do not think Sansa did not kneel for the sake of "whitewashing" Tyrion but because she is not twelve in the series and sees possibilities where a younger girl can't.I love me some book-Tyrion.  He's a beautifully-done grey character that one can empathize with but also condemn.  There's nothing about show-Tyrion that we can condemn; he's some unlikely hero, an avatar for the disadvantaged (perceived or not) to project themselves onto.  He needs his flaws.  He needs Singer Stew, which seems like the only saving grace for his characterization.Here I absolutely agree with you, Garlan Marius. Tyrion "whitewashing" takes away  from this great literary character. But the character Tyrion can be defined by what he does, the aspect of what e.g. Sansa does or does not is not necessary here. I think for the HBO character Sansa not kneeling was not as important as for the book character. But "not kneeling" would have added to the description of Tyrion's position in the eyes of the people at court.

I mean it took away a very decisive moment in the book from her character. And entire story bout Tyrion coming to her was about him, so it was the epic white-washing. I mean, seriously, how much is too much of this Tyrion`s behavior. They have taken him the essence. Both him and Sansa. And tonight`s wedding was all about his issues.

Which is in my opinion, really astonishing.I don't think that one moment (not kneeling) was that big to her character, two instance of defiance with sansa in KL one led to her fathers death and the other humiliating Tyrion, I didn't get that in the book, if she was gonna pick a moment to stand up she had many opportunities to do it to Joffrey. If cercei told her about the wedding and everything that happened after like the books that action would make sense, but them smiling together to leave for the sept only for her to turn around and do that makes no sense. I agree about Tyrion maybe they should call the show Tyrion he's the only character that's all 'good' I don't like that.

And although there were many opportunities she proved to be Stark, this one was the best. As for defying Joffrey, how would that work? She defies him and he punches her.

Notice the brief flash of smile on Shae's face when she realizes Tyrion has not shipped Sansa. It seems to imply that Shae and Tyrion are back to being a couple. But if D&D still intends to keep to the major plots in the books, then Shae will eventually have to betray Tyrion -- this makes me think Tyrion will "stray" from his vow of "chastity", violate Sansa in the process, and offend Shae as a result, which will lead her to "betray" him in the end. If that is the case, that Tyrion ends up violating Sansa despite his vow, then Sansa's bending of her knee earlier on will no doubt help sway viewers to her cause and make Tyrion less "heroic" and less sympathetic.And Tyrion's proclamation of chastity is not much heroism at all considering Sansa's age. I'm sure most viewers will look at Tyrion's vow as the right thing rather than the admirable thing to do. Let's wait a few more episodes (I'd prefer seasons) before we start crying wolf.
5237	Newstar	2013-05-20	Sansa`s refusal to bend the knee was the demonstration of who she is, powerful sign of how strong she is.That's your opinion, though. An opinion many other fans do not share, judging from the highly controversial nature of Sansa's refusal to kneel for Tyrion in the books from what I can tell. In fact, I think your opinion about Sansa's refusal to kneel being a glorious reclamation of her independence and assertion of her defiance of the Lannisters, is in fact a minority opinion, not the prevailing opinion. My sense is that it's generally viewed either as a dick move that's understandable given the circumstances of the wedding, or a dick move full stop, not too dissimilar from Joffrey swiping Tyrion's footstool in this episode. The glorious assertion of rebellion or whatever interpretation really only comes from the hardcore Sansa fans, as far as I can tell.The failure of others to share your opinion does not automatically make them sexist, idiots, or sexist idiots. It makes them holders of a different opinion. Your assertion about Sansa's refusal to bend the knee does not automatically make that the only possible "correct" reaction to her actions; it's just an assertion. I mean, I can assert "I like ham" all I like, but it doesn't make someone else disagreeing with me and asserting "You might like ham, but I don't like ham" any less correct.I'm not saying that your view of Sansa's actions is wrong, just that it's not correct simply because, essentially, you say so, and that others' views of Sansa's actions are not incorrect, sexist, or idiotic simply because you happen to disagree with them.Because honestly, if you hate a 12/14 year old girl for not kneeling for a man she was forced to marry, then you're nothing more than an idiot.More strawmanning; nobody said anything about hating anyone, and it's not just about not kneeling for "a man," but not kneeling for a dwarf in a manner that is calculated to humiliate him (as retribution for the Lannisters' lack of consideration for his feelings) using his dwarfism as a method of hurting him, but you know, whatever, it's not like details are important or anything. By the way, calling people who disagree with you an idiot is not a good way of winning arguments (pro tip!).And honestly, if I can indulge in a little strawmanning of my own, all the manufactured outrage from Sansa fans referring anyone who disagrees with their glowing view of Sansa's character and Sansa's actions as sexists, idiots, or sexist idiots is quite tedious.

5238	Minsc	2013-05-20	I am not too concerned about the apparent lack of sexual threat from Tyrion. Notice the brief flash of smile on Shae's face when she realizes Tyrion has not shipped Sansa. It seems to imply that Shae and Tyrion are back to being a couple. But if D&D still intends to keep to the major plots in the books, then Shae will eventually have to betray Tyrion -- this makes me think Tyrion will "stray" from his vow of "chastity", violate Sansa in the process, and offend Shae as a result, which will lead her to "betray" him in the end.If they have Tyrion rape Sansa I will one up Tywin and actually shit gold in surprise.  In how, there is no way in hell they will have him violate her without her consent in how that would darken the character even worse then the books and I hardly think they are going to do that.The problem is there is already a number of people praising Tryion's act as some great heroism on his part.  Hell, I also always check the TWOP forums after an episode and somebody there was talking about Sansa should have thanked him for not having sex with her despite the fact that would have been rape.

5239	Mendoza	2013-05-20	Saint Tyrion is easily the worst thing about this season. All that whitewashing make most scenes in KL more boring than they should be. Not only his own scenes, but some of those related to him. No real conflict, no tension...I'm ready for him to murder his whore and daddy. The sooner he's out of King's Landing, the better.I think the show could benefit getting the Lannisters split from one another because they've sort of become this sub-show within a show, but without any stakes. The King doesn't even seem scary anymore now that Tywin has declawed him. In season one, when he shows Sansa the heads, he was scary. Here his threat towards her plays as an empty one.

5240	Sansa in the North	2013-05-20	I agree, they never should have made Tyrion the one to tell Sansa in the first place and there would be no need for her to kneel. I think the rest of the wedding was very well done, but this part kinda of sucked. The moment she refused to kneel for Tyrion was when Sansa became one of my favourite characters. It was an important moment for her.I liked the wow of chastity, oddly enough. It was just creepy, the way I saw it. She asked "what if I never want you to" and he replied "now my watch begins, I will wait here forever, not having you, cause you won't let me, but not going away, either" and it reminded me of Nice Guy Syndrome TM, a bit. I'm not good with words, I hope you get what I mean. Maybe someone else can say it better.The problem is there is already a number of people praising Tryion's act as some great heroism on his part.  Hell, I also always check the TWOP forums after an episode and somebody there was talking about Sansa should have thanked him for not having sex with her despite the fact that would have been rape.That's really fucking disturbing. A little girl should be GRATEFUL for not being raped? What the actual fuck.. I can't even...

And I see people agreeing about it. It ois controversial but it is also important.As for me calling anyone idiots, please quote me saying that. I did call the POV of the producers a bit of sexist, but it`s more than just Sansa. It`s about half a dozen female characters. Also, please stop talking to me like I am some boy needing of explanation people can disagree with me. It`s condescending and borderline offensive. You can disagree with me, but you`ll also have to provide some proofs. And I can do that, since Tyrion has been bugged for quite some time by her refusal to bend the knee. So, I would say it`s pretty important

5243	Minsc	2013-05-20	That's really fucking disturbing. A little girl should be GRATEFUL for not being raped? What the actual fuck.. I can't even...To be fair, they are currently arguing over whether or not it should be considered rape if that is any better.

Let's face it, TV Shae is way too loyal to Tyrion to betray him for anything other than reasons involving Sansa.The problem is there is already a number of people praising Tryion's act as some great heroism on his part.  Hell, I also always check the TWOP forums after an episode and somebody there was talking about Sansa should have thanked him for not having sex with her despite the fact that would have been rape.People will always differ in their opinions. I am just glad Sophie Turner was not forced to show too much skin.

By the way, calling people who disagree with you an idiot is not a good way of winning arguments.You're wrong, actually. Someone in this thread said that Sansa fans should be grateful because including Sansa's refusal to kneel would have led to more hate for the character. So no "strawmanning" from me.Sansa refused to kneel for Tyrion because she didn't want to. It wasnot about "hurting him". It was about her having a small but significant moment of defiance.  But then she felt compassion for him when she realised that the people watching were laughing at his dwarfism, so she kneeled later to kiss him. It's an important moment for Sansa.LOL I don't need your opinion on whether I'm "winning" the argument. I genuinely think that anyone who could hate Sansa for refusing to kneel is an idiot. Personally I sympathise with both Sansa and Tyrion in that scene (like we're SUPPOSED TO), but his short humiliation is NOTHING compared to what he did to her by forcing her to marry him.

Thank you! Not to mention that Tyrion wasn't exactly considerate of Sansa at the time. He couldn't even ask her to kneel, he just tugged at her dress like she was a dog or something.

In particular, in comparison to how they have played up Petyr Whiplash who seems ready to molest her at moment's notice.
5249	nirolo	2013-05-20	So? It's the correct opinion. Even if the majority doesn't share it, who cares?If it is an opinion, then it entices the possibility of it being wrong or the possibility of there being alternatives.This is especially true when we are debating the supposed literary interpretation of a particular text or scene with regard to the personality trait of a particular fictional character. Nope, this would never happen.Just no way for numerous reasons.I used "if", didn't I?

It's an important moment for Sansa.I never understood TV subforum. It`s like you need to have majority on your side for argumentation.I always looked at the wedding scene (the book version) as sort of parallel between Sansa, Arya and Lyanna. All three ;adies showed they are very strong, but also very sensitive to other people`s emotions. Lyanna to Howland, Arya to Lady Smallwood, and Sansa to Tyrion. And I really like that.

I am not always right, and I can make mistake. But if you want to prove my opinion is wrong, then please show me that in the books.
5253	Newstar	2013-05-20	David Selig, unless you're GRRM or possess the power of channeling GRRM, you have no business telling other people what the "correct" reaction to or characterization of a character's actions is. That's the great thing about texts! Lots of different opinions and viewpoints about the same things. You're the ultimate arbiter of precisely nothing when it comes to the text, just like the rest of us, so it's inappropriate to pretend otherwise.And again, you seem to be making Mladen's mistake of stating your interpretation as if it's the only possible correct reaction to or interpretation of something. Stating that your view is the correct one doesn't make it so; it is what it is, no more and no less, just as others' opinions are what they are, no more and no less.It seems to imply that Shae and Tyrion are back to being a couple. But if D&D still intends to keep to the major plots in the books, then Shae will eventually have to betray Tyrion -- this makes me think Tyrion will "stray" from his vow of "chastity", violate Sansa in the process, and offend Shae as a result, which will lead her to "betray" him in the end.It's hard to tell with all the quotation marks, but if you're saying that Tyrion's going to rape Sansa, I have to say I'd be very, very surprised. I guess it could cover something more innocuous like kissing her in a weak moment or something, though.I do agree that Shae and Tyrion seem to have smoothed over their differences, meaning that if the jealousy over Tyrion's marriage won't be the source of Shae's betrayal, something else will have to be, and seriously, I got nothing in that department. Material gain seems very unlikely, jealousy now seems unlikely, so maybe we're back to TV Shae being coerced into giving false testimony against Tyrion.

5257	SerMixalot	2013-05-20	The lengths that people will go to defend D&D's decisions.  Sansa not kneeling is the result of 2 years of bad decisions made by D&D.  It is the epitome of why GoT will simply never be a classic TV series.  It is simple the result of 2 years of mischaracterization, cliched simplization and lack of vision.  Tyrion sould be another Al Swearengen or Tony Soprano or Walter White with all the moral ambiguity that goes along with it.  That would make the show so much better than what it is.  As a result characters like Sansa would have far more depth to them.  Of course they had to have her kneel to Tyrion, it was the only logical ending for how they have developed the relationship.  But that takes forgetting that Tyrion is the uncle of the king who lopped her  father's head off in front of her and Sansa's actions make her truly look idiotic and without substance.
Sorry Epic Fail
Edit: Added "father's" really changes the meaning of that sentance

5263	Sansa in the North	2013-05-20	because then almost every relationship in Westeros is based on rape. It's just not the term that should be used really.No, that's not true. There's a difference between an arranged marriage and a forced marriage. Cat and Ned, for example had an arranged marriage, but they both still agreed to it and made their peace with this thought, as it were. Cat agreed to marry Ned for the good of her family. Sansa had no similar choice. She was literally told she's be beaten if she didn't marry Tyrion. That's a forced marriage and if Tyrion had bedded her it would have been rape, because Sansa had not given her consent and was not in a situation where she could give her consent.

GRRM trusts D&D, still writes for the show and is happy to be connected with it. How is it that you are apparently more protective of it than he is?4. If that is your opinion have conviction in it and stop watching the show it is really easy to do all it involves is not sitting down for an hour each week in front of HBO.5.

In contrast, if Sansa said no to marrying Tyrion or Lancel then Tywin would have had her beaten.

5273	KennedyWreck	2013-05-20	Could someone elaborate on the Tyrion whitewashing? I've finished the books but can't think of any major misdeeds they've cut.
5274	PatrickStormborn	2013-05-20	Cat had no say in marrying Ned so Ned raped Cat? This is my last post on what constitutes rape Mladen I am sorry! Cat agreed to marry Ned, just as Sansa agreed to marry Willas. In contrast, Lysa did not agree to marry Jon Arryn, just as Sansa did not agree to marry Tyrion.Cersei is a different case, in that she agreed to marry Robert and have sex with him, but he had sex with her in a way that she had not consented to.
5275	Mladen	2013-05-20	Alright /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />But why? Not trying to be difficult, but I'm quite new here. Why is this a rule?It`s a rule, don`t think about it, unless you want to get yourself banned or warned. Especially since person of interest is minorDude, how you find Newstar's comment offensive is beyond me. /shocked.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':shocked:' />Unlike some posters, Newstar is actually arguing against posters who purportedly state that they have the correct opinions.First, don`t call me dude. Second, it was personal attack on a member. And I won`t say it again. Restrain yourself from commenting about rape, offending or attacking personally anyone.
5276	FuriousGeorge	2013-05-20	Catelyn could have always said no and Hoster would have likely respect her opinion, instead she did it because she felt it was her duty.  In contrast, if Sansa said no to marrying Tyrion or Lancel then Tywin would have had her beaten.I think you are idealising the Tully's far too much
5277	Newstar	2013-05-20	Careful, Newstar, I said I`ll be uncompromising in reporting any offenses, personal attacks etc.I've responded to specific posts of yours and I've pointed out what I think is a logical error that you and David Selig have made in your posts: claiming that your opinion of Sansa's refusal to kneel is the "correct" one, essentially, because you say so (although in your case it was a straightforward assertion that "Sansa's refusal to bend the knee was a powerful sign of who she is," etc. etc.). I think pointing out logical errors made by other posters with reference to specific posts is well within the parameters of the boards, but feel free to report me if you feel otherwise.I also feel personally that it's inappropriate to appoint oneself the arbiter of what's a "correct" interpretation of/reaction to/opinion about the text, unless of course you or David Selig are prepared to out yourselves as GRRM, in which case I want a status update on TWOW. It strikes me as disrespectful to other posters who might hold different opinions, and it's the kind of thinking that winds up manifesting itself in posts referring to whole groups of fans as sexists, idiots, or sexist idiots.I'm not even saying that my interpretation of whatever is correct. It's just my interpretation, and I'm not GRRM. I'm just saying that your interpretation of whatever is not correct just because you think it is. Your view is an opinion, just as my view is an opinion. I'm not saying yours is wrong; I'm just saying it's not necessarily correct simply because you believe that it is. If I'm willing to admit my interpretation might not be correct, because it's just an opinion, and therefore I shouldn't act as if I have all the answers and my opinion trumps everyone else's, why can't you extend others (including myself) the same courtesy?

5278	nirolo	2013-05-20	They won't even have him be dark enough for him to decide not to warn Sansa beforehand about their wedding and you think they will have him perform an attempted drunken rape scene?I thought it was needed to highlight the triangle between Shae, Sansa, and Tyrion. Since they made TV Shae so darn loyal, I don't see how they can make her betray Tyrion other than for love (and the ensuing heartbreaks).

5280	Minsc	2013-05-20	Could someone elaborate on the Tyrion whitewashing? I've finished the books but can't think of any major misdeeds they've cut.Him admitting his desire to see his family burn in AGOT, how his advice to Jon in AGOT was absolutely terrible and almost got Jon killed, his breaking Marrilion's finger in AGOT, his pleasure in seeing Masha Heddle dead in AGOT, his arming of the Vale Wildmen so they can pillage the Vale in AGOT, dropping his active participation in the Tysha affair, his poisoning of Cersei in ACOK, his burning of smallfolks' homes in ACOK, his declaring he will approve mistreatment of Sansa if Jaime is harmed in ACOK, his handing over the Antler Men to Joffrey in ACOK, his threatening to rape and beat Tommen in ACOK, his actually holding a desire for Sansa and Winterfell when the match is proposed in ASOS, his waiting to the last minute to tell her of the Wedding in ASOS, and in all three books he is pretty abusive to Shae along with making fun of Lollys
5281	nirolo	2013-05-20	First, don`t call me dude. Second, it was personal attack on a member. And I won`t say it again. Restrain yourself from commenting about rape, offending or attacking personally anyone.Unless memories serve me wrong, which is entirely possible, I thought you possessed the male organ that would qualify you as a "dude".

I always leave place for people to add their own opinion, but when you are discussing without textual evidence, it is then normal for us to believe you have no proof to support your claim.I don`t want to report anyone, but I would ask of all of you, to stop attacking each other through condescending posts. We don`t know what GRRM thinks, my conclusions are simply from what I have read in the books. And I believe, but that`s only me, that `not kneeling` scene was important for both Tyrion and Sansa. You may argue it, I don`t say you can`t, but you`ll also have to tell me exactlywhy you think so. That`s how productive discussion is being held.Nirolo, I hate the term `dude`, and yes, I am male, but I would like to be reffered as something else

5284	SerMixalot	2013-05-20	1. Its simplification.2. It is already considered a classic by many, perhaps not on the level of Sopranos but that is not an easy accomplishment.3. GRRM trusts D&D, still writes for the show and is happy to be connected with it. How is it that you are apparently more protective of it than he is?4. If that is your opinion have conviction in it and stop watching the show it is really easy to do all it involves is not sitting down for an hour each week in front of HBO.5. Said this before and I'll say it again...I would bet good money that D&D's understanding of the novels is deeper and more comprehensive than yours.1. You're point?2. Shows like 2 and a half men and how I met your mother are also popular, doesnt make em great TV3. GRRM also adjusts characters in the episodes he writes, ie Cersei, Jon4. I still enjoy the show, I thought that the Sam scene was excellent (though missing a NW witness was big)5. When D&D said that Jon Snow was seeking a father figure it makes me wonder whether they have actually read the entire series.  Sorry that is demonstrably false based on their own statements.

That's the great thing about texts! Lots of different opinions and viewpoints about the same things. You're the ultimate arbiter of precisely nothing when it comes to the text, just like the rest of us, so it's inappropriate to pretend otherwise.Oh, come on. I consider my interpretation the correct one. What's the big deal? You are free to disagree.

I don't think anyone who just watches the show would say that, I think they would all say Tyrion would just get rid of him.But if you asked a show-only viewer if Tyrion would marry a 13 year old hostage for her claim to Winterfell and actually hope that the marriage will work out, even going so far as to intend to sleep with her and only refuse when she was already naked and visibly repulsed, they would protest that show Tyrion wouldn't do that. And he wouldn't. And that's the problem.

5317	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-20	Wow, I really don't get the criticism at all regarding the wedding.  To me, Sansa fans should have loved this one.
The removal of the stool by Joffrey presented Sansa with a much different choice than what she had in the book, so her action was different.  Here, Joffrey was trying to humiliate Tyrion, and not kneeling would have been cooperating/playing along with Joffrey's joke.  Essentially, kneeling was siding with Tyrion rather than Joffrey,
And this is actually the first and only episode that I felt Sophie Turner actually acted, and she made me feel more sympathetic to her plight than I ever felt for book Sansa.  The misery on her face the who time was evident to me, as were her lack of options.
 Tyrion delayed with his " I can't" in the bedchamber long enough to suggest he was at least thinking about it. 
But this is where the book and show necessarily had to differ.   They couldn't show to a modern audience a 14 year old stripping down any further, and having Tyrion go as far as he went in the books would have made him seem a worse person than in the books.  The cultural gap between bedding a 14 year old in Westeros versus the RL is just too large, especially given Dinklage's apparent age, to show on tv and have mean the same as it's any in the books.

5319	Penguin king	2013-05-20	Just finished watching this episode and I want to post my thoughts on the Tyrion/Sansa plotline while they're fresh in my mind, so forgive me if a lot of this has already been covered.
1) Sansa Kneeling.
I knew this was going to be controversial as I watched. I agree that it alters Sansa's character in a pretty big way, but I can see why they did it. Sansa is already one of the least popular characters on the show, and Tyrion the most popular. If they'd made a big point of Sansa's one small act of defiance, then I think Sansa would have been in line for even more hate from some of the non book reading tv viewers.
There's no disputing that TV Tyrion has been whitewashed, and that this has had some unfortunate implications when it comes to his relationships with other characters, however I'm going to express an opinion that's probably equally controversial: Book Tyrion is meant to be sympathetic. GRRM wants us to like him dispite  his more evil acts. I think D&D are of the opinion that TV viewers need a hero, and have therefore made an already sympathetic character even more likeable, and that's had the unfortunate side effect of altering how viewers see characters like Shae and Sansa
2) Tyrion smiling at the wedding
I found this odd, considering GRRM makes a point of telling us how miserable he is in the book. I know he was drunk, but he still seemed to be enjoying himself a little too much. Doesn't directly relate to Sansa, so i'll leave that at that.
3) lack of nudity.
Ok, so the show made a pretty big departure from the books here. I think it really hurt both characters. It made tyrion look way too chivalrous, and Sansa was spared all the emotional torment of having to undress infront of a man she barely knows, then have him climb over her drunk and naked.  On the other hand, I can see why  they had to change it.  Sophie was what, 16 when the filmed the scene? I imagine there are laws about the sexulizing of minors on Televison, (and Sophie is a minor by US standards even if she's over the age of sexual consent in the uk)  Not only that but sophie herself would probably have had issues appearing naked, and I doubt the scene as written would have played well with HBO's target audience. They could have gotten around it by having only Peter appear naked, but well, there's Tyrion white washing to do so...
On the other hand, the scene could easily have gone further than it did. Tyrion showed almost no sexual interest in Sansa, and that's a pretty big departure. Tyrion is a man with strong urges, and his cock often wins out over his brain. They really should have presented that struggle, especially as this is one of the few times where his brain comes out ahead.
That;s all i can think of for now. Ended up focusing more on Tyrion than Sansa, but so does the show so i guess that's appropriate. I'll skim through the thread and try and jog my memory about all the things i'm forgetting.
5320	Demandred	2013-05-20	I didn't have a problem with Sansa's reaction. A few things in the scene and in this storyline are different and her reaction is just a reflection of that. In the books, she had no clue that she was getting married until the day and Tyrion is much more sympathetic to her plight in the show than he is in the books. I believe that she realises that. Not to mention that Margaery has been whispering in Sansa's ear, trying to convince that she's landed a decent deal and she should make the most of it. All these factors have to be taken into consideration. 
Although, to the post above, regarding Tyrion and sexual interest in Sansa. I felt that it was apparent that he was very attracted to her as she was undressing. Just from the way he was gazing at her. When she said that she would not like to sleep with him, he backed off but was clearly disappointed.
5321	Joyful Union	2013-05-20	The lengths that people will go to defend D&D's decisions.  Sansa not kneeling is the result of 2 years of bad decisions made by D&D.  It is the epitome of why GoT will simply never be a classic TV series.  It is simple the result of 2 years of mischaracterization, cliched simplization and lack of vision.  Tyrion sould be another Al Swearengen or Tony Soprano or Walter White with all the moral ambiguity that goes along with it.  That would make the show so much better than what it is.  As a result characters like Sansa would have far more depth to them.  Of course they had to have her kneel to Tyrion, it was the only logical ending for how they have developed the relationship.  But that takes forgetting that Tyrion is the uncle of the king who lopped her  father's head off in front of her and Sansa's actions make her truly look idiotic and without substance.Sorry Epic FailThe lengths people will go to demonize D&D are equally considerable. Take this post for example. Many people consider GoT to be already a classic, and the show doesnt only have considerable popular success, but critical success as well.
5322	SerMixalot	2013-05-20	Never said it wasnt a good show, I said it was not what it could be. D&D made conscious decisions to white wash Tyrion, leading inevitably to Sansa not kneeling at her wedding.  That detracts considerably from Sansa's character, making her seem far less strong and intelligent and thus less interesting.  Tyrion by being white washed is far less interesting. 
Sansa smiled while being lead from the room by her groom to be who happened to be the uncle of the king who lopped off her head.  A normal reaction to that would be utter heart wrenching disgust.
5323	Demandred	2013-05-20	She didn't smile as she was following Tyrion to their quarters. She had a look of worry on her face. There's still considerable opportunity to demonstrate her strength and intelligence, the act of kneeling in order to assist Tyrion doesn't detract from that.
5324	Tywin's bastard	2013-05-20	Surprising that people are complaining about Sansa kneeling since that part loses so much from not being able to be inside her head. I don't see how they could make that come across the way it is in the books and it seems incredibly weird to not take into account how very different the TV medium is when you analyze this. On TV it would do nothing but enhance the bad situation for Tyrion, it wouldn't be Sansa making a stand (no pun intended) in her bad situation for people that haven't read the books.
People's inability to really look at the differences in the two mediums and being far too bound to the original seem to really lower the chances for them to enjoy this. Too bad for them but it's entirely up to themselves what they want to do.
5325	SerMixalot	2013-05-20	She didn't smile as she was following Tyrion to their quarters. She had a look of worry on her face. There's still considerable opportunity to demonstrate her strength and intelligence, the act of kneeling in order to assist Tyrion doesn't detract from that.yeah like this season was supposed to be about Arya's transformation into an assasin.
5326	SerMixalot	2013-05-20	Surprising that people are complaining about Sansa kneeling since that part loses so much from not being able to be inside her head. I don't see how they could make that come across the way it is in the books and it seems incredibly weird to not take into account how very different the TV medium is when you analyze this. On TV it would do nothing but enhance the bad situation for Tyrion, it wouldn't be Sansa making a stand (no pun intended) in her bad situation for people that haven't read the books.People's inability to really look at the differences in the two mediums and being far too bound to the original seem to really lower the chances for them to enjoy this. Too bad for them but it's entirely up to themselves what they want to do.Nonsese, if they didnt white wash Tyrion, make his just another Lannister, they could have focused on Sansa's face, tears streaming down her cheeks while Tyrion tugs at her dress.  While having to go get a stool to put the cloak on.and where were the invocation of the 7?
5327	Penguin king	2013-05-20	Ok, Can't think of anything specific to do with the episode, but some general points
1) D&D's take on Sansa
Sansa is a difficult character to translate to television, because so much of what we learn about her comes from what's she's thinking. Outwardly she's general a model of calm courtesy,even though we know the emotions she's feeling and the thoughts that are going through her head are a lot more complex. Jon Snow suffers from the same problem, being another character that doesn't always say what he's thinking.
That's not to say D&D have made the best of a difficult character to write for. By cutting a lot of the Hound and  Dontos scenes Sansa's character has missed out on some important character development, and her replacement scenes with Shae, Littlefinger and Maraery haven't always been of the highest quality. When they make Sansa voice questions such as "will my family be allowed to the wedding?" she seems naive and childish. She has a healthy fantasy life in the books too, but she knows the difference between her dreams and reality, and while she fantasies about her ideal life with Wilas, she's also aware that all he would want her for his her claim on Winterfell. TV Sansa lacks that sort of complexity.
2) Tyrion is not Sansa's enemy.
A lot of people have been arguing that since Sansa is a Stark and tyrion is a Lannister the two must be enemies, and Sansa is right to treat him as such. I don't see it that way. Tyrion wishes no harm on Sansa. he's never harmed another member of her family, He may have fought against Robb's men in battle, but that doesn't mean he and Sansa have to treat each other adversarially. I understand why she'd be weary of him considering all the wrongs Cersei, Joffrey andTywin have done to her, but hurting Tyrion doesn't hurt the rest of his family.  I don't expect her to come to love him, but I don't feel she'd be right to hate him either
3) Forced marriages and Arranged marriages
The line here is a lot greyer than people think.  Show Sansa concented to marry Loras I can agree. She was infatuated with him and her choice seemed genuine, however I don't feel that the same can be said for her book counterpart and Willas. Sansa did not know Wilas, she had no preexisting desire to marry him, at first she even seemed crestfallen by the idea, but marrying Willas was a price. A price she had to pay if she wanted to be free from Joffrey and Cersei.  She may have given her consent, and even talked herself into liking the idea, but you can't deny there was a large element of coersion.  Marry Willas and have your freedom, or stay here and get beaten/raped/worse. is that really any better a choice than the Lannisters were offering her?
Another example. Lysa Tully and Jon Arryn. Clearly an arranged marriage, but a loveless one. Lysa may have consented to her father's will, however the marriage was still a loveless one. Hoster Tully had driven away the boy she truely loved, and had even forced her to abort the bastard child she was carrying. Was Lysa's situation any fairer than Sansa's? Was Lysa any happier after the marriage? Did she really have that much more of a choice?
5328	Fragile Bird	2013-05-20	Don't need to patronice. What I meant to say was that might be some who have no problem IF such a scene exists.You don't need to be so prickly, and you need to read responses.  I said, Sansa is 14 in the HBO scene. She answers Tyrion's question.  A scene with her naked in bed would amount to child pornography in many of the countries the show is seen, whether or not the characters are married.  In what way would showing nude scenes with Arya and Gendry be possible, pray tell?  We are discussing the HBO tv series here, not the books, and irrespective of all the shipping of Arya and Gendry, no way would they show that beyond the schoolgirl crush kind of conversation Arya and Gendry have just before his departure.  And, since you obviously have read the Arya/Gendry ship posts, you also know pretty well everyone talks about "when they are older", because a 4 year age difference when you are 11 is significant.  And those who contemplate an 11 year old and a 15 year in a relationship aren't talking about a sexual relationship.
5329	Demandred	2013-05-20	yeah like this season was supposed to be about Arya's transformation into an assasin.There's plenty of time for Arya's transformation too so I don't see your point. Arya's biggest blow is about to happen in the next episode and then she starts her descent and starts to shut herself off.
5330	Mulled Wino	2013-05-20	Could someone elaborate on the Tyrion whitewashing? I've finished the books but can't think of any major misdeeds they've cut.how about participating in the gang rape of his first wife he allegedly loved?
5331	Joyful Union	2013-05-20	yeah like this season was supposed to be about Arya's transformation into an assasin.I dont think it was. Arya doesnt even kill anyone in the first half of SoS as far as I can remember.
5332	Master Forel's Fro	2013-05-20	how about participating in the gang rape of his first wife he allegedly loved?He was 13 his father told him that was Normal
5333	Mulled Wino	2013-05-20	There's plenty of time for Arya's transformation too so I don't see your point. Arya's biggest blow is about to happen in the next episode and then she starts her descent and starts to shut herself off.That's when you think arya starts her descent?we get 4 theon torture scenes and 2 minutes of arya and sandor that just shows sandor as a nice guy.There's always "plenty of time".  They had plenty of time to do a good rw story and that didnt work out so well.

5334	SerMixalot	2013-05-20	Book Arya goes through a series of incidents where she loses her identity, she is called by a series of different names, confused for a boy and a girl, dressed in a variety of outfits, takes on a series of different roles-many quite humble roles, she kills to escape Harrenhall.  All of these things give her the basic skills to be a FM.
5335	Mulled Wino	2013-05-20	He was 13 his father told him that was Normallmao.....ok. 13 and married.I think people sell 13yr olds waaaaaay short on these boards.  Especially the tyrion apologists.  Arya is about 10 so maybe giving him a pass cuz he was 13 should be reconsidered.  13 yr olds in love (allegedly) I think can recognize when said loved one (allegedly) is being tortured.

5336	Sansa in the North	2013-05-20	He was 13 his father told him that was NormalIf my father told be that was normal I'd call bullshit. Tyrion, even at 13, should really be able to think for himself. And, based on his descriptions of the incident, I think he was able to do that and he knew very well what he was doing to Tysha. That said, he was still a victim in this situation. But he was the abuser, too. He was both.But this is off topic again. I don't want to get in trouble over this. Maybe there should be a separate thread or something.
5337	Master Forel's Fro	2013-05-20	lmao.....ok. 13 and married.I think people sell 13yr olds waaaaaay short on these boards.  Especially the tyrion apologists.  Arya is about 10 so maybe giving him a pass cuz he was 13 should be reconsidered.  13 yr olds in love (allegedly) I think can reckognize when said loved one (allegedly) is being tortured.I was being sarcastic, after his father and brother tell him that she's a whore he participates in a way punishing her too for lying to him, he hates being mocked and he saw it like she was making fun of him even if he later regreted it.
5338	juanml82	2013-05-20	Here's another of my problems with the wedding.  So much of it was about Cersei resisting the things going on around her instead of Sansa doing this.  Cersei is the Queen Regent, Sansa is a hostage but you'd hardly remember that in this episode.  What happened to the Sansa who told Joffrey that maybe her brother would bring her his head or the Sansa who wanted to push Joffrey off the ledge?She was beaten by the kingsguard.I didn't go through all the 12 pages. I liked when Sansa didn't kneel in the books, but I think having her kneel works better in the show: she wasn't physically trying to get away like in the books (and the not-kneeling being the last of her physical resistance), there is no Dontos so Tyrion doesn't have many other ways to put the cloak and Joffrey's presence is a reminder of what will happen if she resists.We know she is there against her will. Joffrey also reminds us that she's against the marriage because he's a Lannister, so nothing to nitpick there. The only nitpick I have is that she wasn't wearing Stark colours when she walked into the sept, but the show never mentioned House colours save for Tyrell green.I liked Sansa and Tyrion arc this episode. Not the character's greatest moments, but no idiocy either
5339	nirolo	2013-05-20	lmao.....ok. 13 and married.I think people sell 13yr olds waaaaaay short on these boards.  Especially the tyrion apologists.

Jon had the balls to stand up to Alliser Thorne when he was only fourteen even though he wasn't even remotely in love with Sam......or was it love of first sight?

I guess I was sensitive because someone actually used that argument last week!  Hating being mocked and gang raping because of it certainly is an example if they greying of his character.  But this might be the wrong thread
5341	Mulled Wino	2013-05-20	This is true. Jon had the balls to stand up to Alliser Thorne when he was only fourteen even though he wasn't even remotely in love with Sam......or was it love of first sight?Love at first sight, clearly.

Jon had the balls to stand up to Alliser Thorne when he was only fourteen even though he wasn't even remotely in love with Sam......or was it love of first sight?Who was it that said Sam was curvy enough that the men might not care he's a boy, allister?
5343	nirolo	2013-05-20	Who was it that said Sam was curvy enough that the men might not care he's a boy, allister?Can't recall.But Chett did fantasize about sticking his sword down Sam's throat.
5344	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-20	I was being sarcastic, after his father and brother tell him that she's a whore he participates in a way punishing her too for lying to him, he hates being mocked and he saw it like she was making fun of him even if he later regreted it.I got the sense that Tyrion was pretty badly scarred by what happened to Tysha, and in particular his participation in that.  But he was just 13, abused by a warped father, and in the midst of a hundred soldiers.  And in a culture where, though wrong, it certainly wasn't illegal to do that.  The problem is that if you take that Tysha scene as it happened, and present it to modern-era viewers who aren't immersed in the culture and background of Westeros the way readers are, the reaction to Tyrion is likely to be far more negative that the written story contemplates, and he would be a much, much worse character.My personal take on the Tysha scene was that it was horrible abuse by Tywin of both Tysha and a very young Tyrion.
5345	Mladen	2013-05-20	Wow, I really don't get the criticism at all regarding the wedding.  To me, Sansa fans should have loved this one.So, the lines are still drawn regarding this one? OK, I should explain why me, as Sansa fan didn`t like this.The removal of the stool by Joffrey presented Sansa with a much different choice than what she had in the book, so her action was different.  Here, Joffrey was trying to humiliate Tyrion, and not kneeling would have been cooperating/playing along with Joffrey's joke.  Essentially, kneeling was siding with Tyrion rather than Joffrey,And why the stool was removed at the first place? Was that so neccessary? The only effect it had it shifted perspective from Sansa to Tyrion. The stool was something made up so, you have to think about Tyrion, not Sansa. They managed, very cunningly to make her miseries equal as his. And they never were the same. So, although you have the point about Sansa not kneeling, here is the real question why did we have a stool taken by Joffrey at the first place?And this is actually the first and only episode that I felt Sophie Turner actually acted, and she made me feel more sympathetic to her plight than I ever felt for book Sansa.  The misery on her face the who time was evident to me, as were her lack of options.We agree on this. The two best parts about Sansa this episode were music and Sophie. And although she was given one line, comparing toi two dozens of Tyrion`s she managed to do the best out of them. And that was one hell of a job.But this is where the book and show necessarily had to differ.   They couldn't show to a modern audience a 14 year old stripping down any further, and having Tyrion go as far as he went in the books would have made him seem a worse person than in the books.  The cultural gap between bedding a 14 year old in Westeros versus the RL is just too large, especially given Dinklage's apparent age, to show on tv and have mean the same as it's any in the books.We also agree on this. I understand the limitations they are facing with, and I thought, unlike in Melisandre`s scene, that this was the right line. She was nude in terms of medieval society, but dressed more than enough for us. I liked the scene, just I wish they were equal there.
5346	Penguin king	2013-05-20	I don't see why people think Tywin is such an easy man for Tyrion to stand up to. We're talking about a man who had two families wiped out, man woman and child for daring to oppose him. the man who ordered Elia Martell and her young children brutaly murdered. Jaime has trouble standing up to him, Cersei has trouble standing up to him, why should it be so easy for a 3 foot tall, 13 year old boy?
5347	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-20	Although, to the post above, regarding Tyrion and sexual interest in Sansa. I felt that it was apparent that he was very attracted to her as she was undressing. Just from the way he was gazing at her. When she said that she would not like to sleep with him, he backed off but was clearly disappointed.So did I.  What is odd about this debate are that people are seeing the exact same scenes on the TV, and yet interpreting the characters' internal thoughts and emotions so differently.  I'm not sure what D&D can do if some fans take it one way, and some take it the other.  The books are full of italicized internal character thoughts that clarify what that character is thinking, but you just can't do that on the show. It depends on actor portrayals, and at least to me, both Dinklage and Turner nailed what their characters are supposed to be feeling.Obviously, that's a matter of perspective on performances, and is going to vary between viewers.
5348	-Ghost-	2013-05-20	My problem with the scene was that Sansa looked more pleased about it than she should be, as though she just realised that she was very lucky she was marrying the best Lannister and she should be grateful for that. Her situation in the show is pretty much "unless is not Joffrey" when in books it's more like "it could be worst but is still pretty bad", she has accepted, but she's miserable, everybody notices that, even Tyrion himself who later has no idea how to please her, nor even make her smile for a moment.Many people complains that Sansa is not a "real Stark" but during her wedding, she does behave as a Stark as well as a Tully. She knows she can't escape, as Cersei pointed out, they would take her by force if needed, so, she decides she would act honorably about it by going willingly instead of being dragged or cry but always showing that she was only doing it because it was her duty, not her pleasure, and that's why she doesn't bend the knee not help his husband in any way to put the cloack on her, she's giving him, and by implication all the Lannisters, a "I don't f care how you manage to do this, I won't move a muscle" attitude.This episode didn't give me that impression. They portray Sansa as though she had accepted that she was marrying the best Lannister and she had no problem about it: but of course she had a problem, he was a Lannister. Accepting that marrying a Lannister wasn't "that bad" was accepting that she was in good terms with the family that cut her father's head and were in war with her brother. Didn't Dany implied that things that don't break eventually break? In Sansa's situation, bending would be the proof that the Lannister finally broke her down.I agree with this. I still hate that they changed it. It was a small victory for Sansa in a time of her life where she has absolutely no control of it.
5349	Sansa in the North	2013-05-20	I don't see why people think Tywin is such an easy man for Tyrion to stand up to. We're talking about a man who had two families wiped out, man woman and child for daring to oppose him. the man who ordered Elia Martell and her young children brutaly murdered. Jaime has trouble standing up to him, Cersei has trouble standing up to him, why should it be so easy for a 3 foot tall, 13 year old boy?It shouldn't be easy for a 13 year old, which is why I don't blame Tyrion for what happened to Tysha. But a grown man SHOULD be able to stand up to his father even if that father is Tywin Lannister, and if he is not I will judge him accordingly.In ASOS Tyrion was told he would marry Sansa. He protested some. He was told he would get Winterfell and that the alternative is Lollys. Tyrion agreed.In AFFC Jaime was told he would give up his Kingsguard post and marry Margaery so they wouldn't have to marry her to Tommen. Jaime said no. Told Tywin to go hang himself basically. And for a while, he and Tywin did not speak. But Jaime stood his ground. So it's not impossible to stand up to Tywin.Also, Tywin never Ordered Elia murdered. The children, yes, but not Elia. He just didn't tell the mountain NOT to do it and he used his initiative.So did I.  What is odd about this debate are that people are seeing the exact same scenes on the TV, and yet interpreting the characters' internal thoughts and emotions so differently.  I'm not sure what D&D can do if some fans take it one way, and some take it the other.

It depends on actor portrayals, and at least to me, both Dinklage and Turner nailed what their characters are supposed to be feeling.Obviously, that's a matter of perspective on performances, and is going to vary between viewers.So did I, actually. My only problem is the kneeling. Everything else was done to perfection. I think it was obvious Tyrion was ogling Sansa and the wow of chastity was really creepy and fitting. I understand they couldn't go farther because Sophie is 17, but they shouldn't have taken the kneeling moment away from her and in order to keep that in they needed a less whitewashed Tyrion. So it's more the portrayal of Tyrion in general that I'm complaining about than these particular scenes.

The scenes, the music and the acting, especially in the sleeping room was perfect. My only complaint is that, while Tyrion was so vocal about expressing his misery, Sansa was so quiet. In a way it was like she is forcing him to marry her. With one line she managed to break that monologue which was written sole purposely to give us how bad the golden boy feels.

5351	ebevan91	2013-05-20	The whitewashing of Tyrion continues to show after last night's episode. 
Everybody's calling Sansa (not necessarily in this thread) a bitch for distrusting Tyrion because how could anyone dislike sweet innocent Tyrion, right?
5352	Master Forel's Fro	2013-05-20	How are they gonna go from the jolly happy Lil dwarf skipping down the corridors of KL to being on the run in the free cities. I can't imagine him the way he is now. they either suddenly change him to that mad for revenge tyrion or stay the same and be all I'm smart ill talk my way out of this too.
5353	nirolo	2013-05-20	I think you guys are worrying too much. 
Have we ever seen TV Tyrion this drunk and this unkempt in any of the previous episodes?
It's the beginning of Tyrion's downward spiral, I'm calling it.
5354	ChromeWeasel	2013-05-20	They can do what they want in the US as long as the actors are overage in the US and as long as it doesn't fit the mercurial definition of what is obscene. But in a few other countries like the UK if the fictional character is underage, it can be illegal even if the actor is not.It doesn't work that way in the US and Australia. You can't take an 18 year old actress, put her on screen, and tell people that she's 14, and then show her having sex. That's going to be prosecuted as child pornography. It's foolish way to handle things, but people get so fired up about child porn that it's ridiculously over-enforced.Hell, you can't even get away with cartoon or 3D images having sex if the cartoon might be of an under the age of consent cartoon character : http://www.comicsrep...or_cartoon_pornThat kind of thing makes me sick. We shouldn't care what people are doing if no one is hurt in the process. I understand why you don't want actual human beings to be involved in sex for money. I do not understand why it matters when it's just artwork and cartoon or 3d images. There's no actual human being exploited or hurt in this case.
5355	Sigrunn	2013-05-20	It's not such a relevant detail (nor is it my place to discuss fashion).... but her dress did not match my expectations.
5356	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-20	And why the stool was removed at the first place? Was that so neccessary?Yes, because the scene as written would not have had the same meaning if recreated on the screen.  That entire wedding scene is told in the books with Sansa's internal thoughts.  But viewers don't see italicized internal thoughts -- they only see actions, so recreating the exact actions of the scenes without the internal thoughts is going to result in a portrayal with a different meaning.One action we get in the book is Sansa's acknowledging that Tryion was not Joffrey, and saying "you were kind to me" to Tyrion before the ceremony.  So let's assume the book is followed, and that gets said.  Wedding begins with Sansa acknowledging that Tyrion has been kind to her.Then the kneeling scene.  And here, I think book Sansa fans are guilty of some revisionism by misinterpreting her refusal to kneel as some big statement of principle.  But it's not.  Sansa's emotions at that point are neither admirable nor positive.  Sansa's not thinking of any big issue when she refuses to kneel.  She hears everyone laughing at Tyrion, and then thinks in the text "why should I spare his feelings, when no one cares about mine?  That's not a protest in principle against mistreatment -- it's kicking the dog because you had a bad day at work.  "Stubbornly she pressed her lips together and pretended not to notice."   Think of how that would look on screen.  It's spoiled and self-centered, particularly because you just acknowledged to the audience that he was kind to you.  Now, you're acting immaturely and deliberately embarassing the one person who has actually been kind to you (when he had nothing to gain by it) in front of the entire court:  "They were all laughing by then, Joffrey the loudest."  That's not right, and it does not say something positive about her character.And we know that from Sansa herself, because to her credit, when she turns around and sees him, "suddenly she was ashamed of her stubborness.  She smoothed her skirts and knelt in front of him...."Yet viewers wouldn't get the benefit of Sansa's internal regret -- her shame -- for not kneeling for Tyrion.  They'd just see him saying he was kind, her humiliating him while the whole Court, especially Joffrey, laughs, and then her, without explanation, eventually kneeling.  I don't see how a fan of Sansa can think that makes her come off better then they way it was filmed.  They removed an action of which Sansa herself was ashamed, and instead presented her as having dignity and kindness to a person whose kindness she acknowledged.The mediums are different, and sometimes, you have to change things up to get to the same place.  To me, the only growth Sansa actually showed as a person here was when she was ashamed of her actions, and actually managed to do the mature thing and separate her anger at her situation from the person who had done her no harm.  And hell, even if people disagree that Tyrion was kind, the text says that Sansa thought he was, and that Sansa was ashamed of herself for not kneeling. We agree on this. The two best parts about Sansa this episode were music and Sophie. And although she was given one line, comparing toi two dozens of Tyrion`s she managed to do the best out of them. And that was one hell of a job.I'm not a fan of the actress', but her talents suited this scene perfectly.  She's good at playing subdued and depressed.

5357	mrunderhill	2013-05-20	Once you change Sansa's character and make Tyrion the star of the show, you cannot make Sansa kneel down, without
1) Making her look bitchy
2) Altering scenes to make Tyrion look as bad as he is in the books.
In the book Tyrion is content to marry Sansa by force. In the show Tyrion suffers from the decision too. It is ruining his relationship with the woman he loves and he is forced into it. In the show Tyrion is always nice to Sansa and regrets the situation they are in. In the show they are both victims of Tywin's grab for power. Both victims of Joffrey's abuse.
5358	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-20	The thing that irks me most is people denying how whitewashed Tyrion is and using inane comments such as 'ugh book purists' 'lol don't watch the show' 
Tyrion is ridiculously whitewashed to the point that he is just no where near the same character that he is in the books and the fact that so many people are saying he isn't really changed for the show is fucking ridiculous.
5359	Mulled Wino	2013-05-20	I don't see why people think Tywin is such an easy man for Tyrion to stand up to. We're talking about a man who had two families wiped out, man woman and child for daring to oppose him. the man who ordered Elia Martell and her young children brutaly murdered. Jaime has trouble standing up to him, Cersei has trouble standing up to him, why should it be so easy for a 3 foot tall, 13 year old boy?not the same as your family.
5360	Mother of Mini Dragons	2013-05-20	I knew they wouldn't have Sansa not kneel so I was less disappointed when it didn't happen. I think the feeling of her misery was still conveyed and her horror and embarrassment was augmented by Tyrion's behavior during the wedding. No bride no matter what circumstance wants their husband acting like that on their wedding day.  
I agree that they have taken away a lot of the agency from Sansa in this series as they have with other female characters. It's almost as if GRRM's writing is too progressive for tv producers to truly wrap their minds around and be able to convey. Yet, whether it's a good thing or bad thing or a statement in and of itself, this show is still one of the most dynamic in producing interesting and complex female characters when compared to most of what else is on television.
My hubby, the non-book reader, felt horrible for Sansa the whole episode even though she was marrying Tyrion.  I think that a viewer can understand how awful this is for Sansa despite all the white-washing that we know is going on for Tyrion.  I think a lot of the credit goes to Sophie Turner for doing such a great job and I am definitely enjoying seeing her and Peter Dinklage interact with one another on the show more. It is a interesting dynamic.

5361	mrunderhill	2013-05-20	not the same as your family.Jaime and possibly Gerion are the only two people, who have ever stood up to Tywin. When Jaime does it, he ends up being disowned. As much as Tyrion hates Joffrey, you get the sense of respect he has when Joffrey dares stand up to Tywin. It is not an easy thing to do. However, it is the kind of thing most normal people would do once their spouse had been raped. Tyrion even being able to perform in such a scenario is a strike against him.
5362	ChromeWeasel	2013-05-20	I knew they wouldn't have Sansa not kneel so I was less disappointed when it didn't happen. I think the feeling of her misery was still conveyed and her horror and embarrassment was augmented by Tyrion's behavior during the wedding. No bride no matter what circumstance wants their husband acting like that on their wedding day.  I agree that they have taken away a lot of the agency from Sansa in this series as they have with other female characters. It's almost as if GRRM's writing is too progressive for tv producers to truly wrap their minds around and be able to convey. Yet, whether it's a good thing or bad thing or a statement in and of itself, this show is still one of the most dynamic in producing interesting and complex female characters when compared to most of what else is on television.My hubby, the non-book reader, felt horrible for Sansa the whole episode even though she was marrying Tyrion.  I think that a viewer can understand how awful this is for Sansa despite all the white-washing that we know is going on for Tyrion.  I think a lot of the credit goes to Sophie Turner for doing such a great job and I am definitely enjoying seeing her and Peter Dinklage interact with one another on the show more. It is a interesting dynamic.I feel a lot more sympathy for Sansa than I do Tyrion in the show. She's being forced to marry against her will and she's giving up everything in the process. Tyrion isn't giving up a thing and he is acting like a spoiled brat. I get that he's in love. But that's a really stupid pipe-dream anyway. The show has made this clear. Everything that is wrong with Tyrion is completely his own doing. He's catered to Shae, covered up their affair, and compromised everything to keep her around. It's moronic.Maybe there are women and (some) men who think that is romantic. But even in modern times I'd consider Tyrion to be stupid and short-sighted at this point. In terms of Westeros he's being absolutely insane. If he really wanted to be with Shae he should have finagled that. He could have secured enough cash to live happily enough overseas. He seems more interested in whining about how bad he has it than actually doing anything about it. And to be absolutely clear, Tyrion does not have it bad. He's a lord of the richest, most powerful family in Westeros. He's marrying a beautiful young wife which will likely inherit him the north. He's being handed more wealth and influence than almost anyone on the planet. And he's resentful about it because it's not storybook enough for him. At this point he's acting more like an adolescent romantic young girl than Sansa Stark is!By comparison, Sansa is being much more politically savvy than Tyrion. She seems to have learned a lot from Margaery and is behaving more like a grown-up at just 14 years old than Tyrion is at 30 something.

5363	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-20	The thing that irks me most is people denying how whitewashed Tyrion is and using inane comments such as 'ugh book purists' 'lol don't watch the show'Tyrion is ridiculously whitewashed to the point that he is just no where near the same character that he is in the books and the fact that so many people are saying he isn't really changed for the show is fucking ridiculous.Isn't that a bit harsh?  I mean, if you've got complex characters, it is inevitable that people are going to have different moral views of those characters, and some folks, fully informed of book Tyrion's acts, my still think him to be a very good guy, while others, equally informed, may feel differently.I've been posting on this series since the board before this one, the board before that one, and the board before that.  So it isn't like I'm unfamiliar with the books or online discussions of characters going back more than 15 years.I personally believe that people should be judged in the context of the times in which they live.  Tyrion would be a much shittier guy in the 21st century, but he's not in the 21st century.  I look at his acts of kindness towards people who meant nothing to him (the best way to judge character) and I see him helping Bran and Jon, while knowing that their family hates him.  I seem him being kind to and standing up for Sansa before he had any motive to do so, simply because he thought it was wrong.  And that's after being raised in an immediate family of borderline sociopaths who, except for Jaime, have hated and tormented him since birth.  Given that, I think he's come out more than okay.The worst stain on him is Tysha.  But as horrible as it was, I think Tywin was the real villain there.  Tyrion was a young boy who'd been abused by that fucker his whole life, and then was placed into this situation that must have been a nightmare for him.  And I've always read his character as having been ashamed of his eventual participation in that rape.  In fact, I think it haunts him, to the point where his participation in that rape is the core reason why he kills his father.. In the context of Westerosi morals, and the times in which he lived, I don't view his actions as the 21st century moral equivalent of some 13 year old boy raping a girl.   Still horrible, but his age, father, etc.., don't make it a thing that makes me judge him adversely more than a decade later.So to me, Tyrion hasn't been whitewashed because I thought he was a damn good guy to begin with.  His flaws/sins, to me, were minimal given normal Westerosi morals and his horrible, abusive upbringing.  He's a whoremonger, drinker, and willing to live on his family's wealth, so he's not a Ned Stark paragon of virtue with on the show or in the books.

5366	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-20	My hubby, the non-book reader, felt horrible for Sansa the whole episode even though she was marrying Tyrion.  I think that a viewer can understand how awful this is for Sansa.... Yes, exactly this.  Unless your purpose in watching the show is to see a scene by scene recreation, or at least, a perfect recreation of certain scenes that have particular relevance for individual viewers, Sansa's wedding left viewers, IMHO, in the rigfht frame of mind.  This was a miserable experience for Sansa, and though not as bad for Tyrion, still not something he enjoyed either.  It's clear she doesn't want to be married to him, and it's clear he's attempting to be as honorable about it as he can unde rthe circumstances.  That's right about how it should look.

It's clear she doesn't want to be married to him, and it's clear he's attempting to be as honorable about it as he can unde rthe circumstances.  That's right about how it should look.Except in the books it is not like that. It is a miserable, forced marriage for Sansa, but for Tyrion is not that bad. He does not seem cut up about it at all.
5368	Sansa in the North	2013-05-20	Yes, exactly this.  Unless your purpose in watching the show is to see a scene by scene recreation, or at least, a perfect recreation of certain scenes that have particular relevance for individual viewers, Sansa's wedding left viewers, IMHO, in the rigfht frame of mind.

It's clear she doesn't want to be married to him, and it's clear he's attempting to be as honorable about it as he can unde rthe circumstances.  That's right about how it should look.That didn't happen in the books. He very nearly raped her. And he was convinced to marry her in the first place by being offered Winterfell and threatened with Lollys. He gets a queer chill at the thought of being Lord Protector of Winterfell and he thinks how it would benice to have his own castle away from the capital, not even acknowledging that this would mean the death of his future wife's brother at his family's hands. Then he acts all jilted because Sansa doesn't want him for his looks ("that's why gods made whores for imps") when he himself doesn't want Lollys because of her looks. That's not what I'd consider honourable behaviour.
5369	Isildur's Mane	2013-05-20	I'm sorry, I haven't had the chance to read all of this thread yet, (it is getting a bit late here) but this was on my mind.While, overall, I liked the wedding, I didn't like how Sansa not kneeling was removed. I have tried to understand it, and I'm not as against it as I thought I'd be, but it feels like the easy way out.It is almost like the writers don't have faith in the actors perfomance or the audiences intelligence. I know it would be hard to pull off - because in the books we get Sansa's internal reasonings and that wouldn't translate well on screen - but they could of thought of another way to do it or put some trust in the actors to perform it, I would think that both Sophia and Peter are capable of pulling it off.But in losing this moment, we lose the depth of the scene and some much neede character development of Sansa, which also has an effect (affect? I always get confused) on Tyrion as the story progresses. Both characters will suffer and have been suffering because of the lack of depth and subtlety of the TV series.That's just my 2 cents. I'm sorry if this isn't very clear, but it is getting late and I am tired and should be in bed. Goodnight all (or good morning wherever you are)

5370	Tywin's bastard	2013-05-20	Nonsese, if they didnt white wash Tyrion, make his just another Lannister, they could have focused on Sansa's face, tears streaming down her cheeks while Tyrion tugs at her dress.  While having to go get a stool to put the cloak on.and where were the invocation of the 7?What you say doesn't convey strength in Sansa at all. It would look like Sansa is just too sad and scared to have presence of mind enough to do anything, or they could have made her look like a petty bitch. Without the internal monologue you don't get the nuance of it, especially since she's been petty before and never stood up to anyone.

You're choosing to take the arguing literally, without context, to imply that I am advocating condemnation of people who raise above the morality of their time as well?Let me make the point clear, then, to hopefully forestall more jackalling.  I think that when people commit an act that we judge to be a sin, or wrongful, the prevailing morality and culture of their time should be taken as a mitigating factor in judging how much they should be condemned.  So, I do not think that George Washington was a horrible man just because he kept slaves, given that he was raised in a culture in which slavery was accepted.  Certainly, I would not judge him the same as a Presidental candidate running for office in 2012 who advocated a return to slavery.On the other hand, though the prevailing view of the time was that whites were superior to blacks, and that treating blacks as equal to whites was wrong, I do not think those enlightened souls who did so should be condemned.Capice?
5372	PatrickStormborn	2013-05-20	If you think Sansa would look "bitchy" for refusing to kneel for a man who forced her to marry him, then there's a huge problem with you for identifying with an abuser over the victim. It's fine to feel sympathy for Tyrion during his wedding (believe it or not, even I feel sorry for Tyrion!), but Sansa is the true victim who has been put into a position no child should ever have to be in.

David Selig then pointed out that in the context of that time Tyrion is guilty of the greatest sin, murdering his own father.

He does not want to marry Sansa, but is being forced to by Tywin. In the show all four of them: Sansa, Tyrion, Cersei and Loras are victims. They have all been forced by Tywin to marry people they don't want to. Sansa may have it the worst, but all four are suffering.

5376	Mladen	2013-05-20	Yes, because the scene as written would not have had the same meaning if recreated on the screen.  That entire wedding scene is told in the books with Sansa's internal thoughts.  But viewers don't see italicized internal thoughts -- they only see actions, so recreating the exact actions of the scenes without the internal thoughts is going to result in a portrayal with a different meaning.One action we get in the book is Sansa's acknowledging that Tryion was not Joffrey, and saying "you were kind to me" to Tyrion before the ceremony.  So let's assume the book is followed, and that gets said.  Wedding begins with Sansa acknowledging that Tyrion has been kind to her.But, that is the problem. Entire season we were seeing this train going straight to collision, and we knew that every wrong choice they made is going to be paid. If Tyrion didn`t walk to Sansa and talked to her, Sansa`s reaction would be much different, and then you wouldn`t be surprised she didnt kneel. And the problem with that idea is that Tyrion would look bad or at least he would be more bookish. This entire episode wasn`t mistake by itself, mistakes made in it are consequences of poorly written season. The moment in which she refuses to kneel was between the two of them. Her resistence and insensitivity and his shame and anger. But, on TV we got Joffrey involved before it started, and it was all about Tyrion and Joffrey. Sansa was just a neutral participant there, and that`s not by far what we had in books.Then the kneeling scene.  And here, I think book Sansa fans are guilty of some revisionism by misinterpreting her refusal to kneel as some big statement of principle.  But it's not.  Sansa's emotions at that point are neither admirable nor positive.  Sansa's not thinking of any big issue when she refuses to kneel.  She hears everyone laughing at Tyrion, and then thinks in the text "why should I spare his feelings, when no one cares about mine?  That's not a protest in principle against mistreatment -- it's kicking the dog because you had a bad day at work.  "Stubbornly she pressed her lips together and pretended not to notice."   Think of how that would look on screen.  It's spoiled and self-centered, particularly because you just acknowledged to the audience that he was kind to you.  Now, you're acting immaturely and deliberately embarassing the one person who has actually been kind to you (when he had nothing to gain by it) in front of the entire court:  "They were all laughing by then, Joffrey the loudest."  That's not right, and it does not say something positive about her character.Sansa refused to kneel before the first laugh, but when the laugh became too loud and jokes were made, she reconsidered her decision and knelt. In one scene, we have demonstration of her defiance and her compassion. That`s why this scene is important. Also, the ruin of the marriage began with it. For Tyrion never forgave her for not kneeling it.As for show, I said it already, out of frying pan into the fire. You have every point when you say that not kneeling would be interpreted differently, but the problem here is that it was created atmosphere where her refusal to kneel would be interpreted as something else. And the only ones who are 100% guilty about it are writers. This episode is just result of everything we have seen entire season.The mediums are different, and sometimes, you have to change things up to get to the same place.  To me, the only growth Sansa actually showed as a person here was when she was ashamed of her actions, and actually managed to do the mature thing and separate her anger at her situation from the person who had done her no harm.  And hell, even if people disagree that Tyrion was kind, the text says that Sansathought he was, and that Sansa was ashamed of herself for not kneeling.Not kneeling was progress in one direction, kneeling in another. And these two parallel growing-ups didn`t exclude each other in the books. The medium is different and I agree we can`t see everything, but we can see something. With good actors you can do wonders. And these two could make perfect wedding if only writers have deeper vision about it. But, entire thing was subdued to Tyrion and his feelings. First the long monologue, then the stool, then the drinking and arguing with Joffrey and lastly another dialogue which was about him. Sansa was here saying a word or two, completely being cut off in some way from what`s happening to her.But, I have to agree, when you cross the Rubicon, it`s too late. And Rubicon here was crossed in episode 6, when Tyrion told Sansa about the wedding. So, every scene from both of them from that moment is directly influenced and tarnished with it. So, was this episode bad because of itself? No. There were some great detail involving Sansa too, but the greatest problem is that mistake was made long before and just like in chain reaction, one thing influences the next one.As someone who appreciates good and polite discussion, I have to thank you for giving me one. We have difference of opinions, and I doubt each one of us will soon change his POV, but that is not reason for insulting. Again, thank you for that.
5377	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-20	That didn't happen in the books. He very nearly raped her.Again, show versus book, versus RL.  In the RL, a 25+ year old man whose family fills a girl's family, takes her to their house, has her married without her consent, and then has sex with her, is going to jail for a very long time.  His conduct is horribly, horribly out of bounds for what our society deems acceptable.  That's rape, and a crime.  That is not a crime in Westeros, and it's not rape in Westeros, whatever 21st century sensibilities you'd wish to impose there.What Tyrion did in the books was legal, and though the circumstances are on the dicey side legally, that's only because of a disputed succession.  Very few Westerosi would have considered it rape.  In fact, the consensus would have been that Tyrion had the legal right to do it.  Even Sansa, a shitty as those circumstances were, knew that the bedding would be in accordance with Westerosi custom.As for the show v. books, you can't have a 14year old girl disrobe and get fondled, even on HBO, without everyone permanently hating the character who does that, which I very stronlgy doubt would have been consistent with how GRRM views Tyrion.  The few moments of indecision/desire before Tyrion told this 14 year old to stop disrobing still conveys the idea that he wanted to at some level, but thought it was wrong.
5378	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-20	If you think Sansa would look "bitchy" for refusing to kneel for a man who forced her to marry him, then there's a huge problem with you for identifying with an abuser over the victim.Then go argue with Sansa herself, who was ashamed in the books for not kneeling.Perhaps there's a huge problem with you being unable to separate a work of fiction from the modern world.

And she knew what he was going through and knelt. That was pure Sansa in all her glory, her greatest virtue has always been her compassion.
5380	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-20	Sansa refused to kneel before the first laugh, but when the laugh became too loud and jokes were made, she reconsidered her decision and knelt. In one scene, we have demonstration of her defiance and her compassion.What about her shame at not kneeling for him?  Because that's the only actual emotion stated to us in that scene.  Presumably, people are only going to be ashamed of actions they regret.  And without that internal monologue that is necessarily missing from the TV scene, the audience won't know that she feels ashamed for not kneeling.Nor do I see "defiance", frankly.  To me, defiance would have been an internal monologue of "I am not going to kneel in front of this family that killed my father and forced me into this."  Instead, we get the far more self-centered and immature "why should I care about his feelings if no one cares about mine."  And again, her shame over those thoughts is what redeems her, yet it's precisely what the audience would miss if it was shown that way on TV.As someone who appreciates good and polite discussion, I have to thank you for giving me one. We have difference of opinions, and I doubt each one of us will soon change his POV, but that is not reason for insulting. Again, thank you for that.Well, you're welcome, although I don't think all discussions need necessarily be academically devoid of passion.
5381	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-20	And you say... that by killing Tywin Tyrion rose above the morality of his time? Or what? That doesn't make any kind of sense at all.It does if you believe that Tywin deserved death, regardless of his familial connection to Tyrion.

5382	Sansa in the North	2013-05-20	It does if you believe that Tywin deserved death, regardless of his familial connection to Tyrion.Commiting murder is never a morally right decision, regardless of whether the victim "deserves it" in your opinion. Murder is wrong. Period. And killing his father certainly doesn't make Tyrion rise above the morality of his time. I'd say he fits right in, but as stated above, kinslaying is actually the worst kind of sin in Westeros... so Tyrion is the worst sinner... unless you are willing to apply 21st century standards here. But then you must do the same when judging his conduct towards Sansa.

Did he give her choice Why is she the immature one when she stated the truth? Tyrion couldn`t care less about her feelings, and we all know it. Sansa wasn`t just immature here, she was also paying him back for deceiving her. That line about her feelings is self-centered and she should think about herself, for no one else does. Don`t you remember what Tyrion could have gained with this marriage. remember when Tywin says that Sansa is the prize he couldn`t ever hoped for. This was Tyrion`s `dream wedding`(in terms of politics, ambition and self-centered opinion). Perhaps audience would hate her for not kneeling, but now we are spinning in circles - the writers would be the only one guilty for that. Also, do you honestly believe she needed redemption in any moment of her wedding? Well, you're welcome, although I don't think all discussions need necessarily be academically devoid of passion.As I can see, the both of us are rather passionate in defending our POV /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />

He tells her honestly that it was Tywin's idea not his, that if she doesn't marry him Tywin will probably have her married off to Lancel instead, and  If she doesn't want to go through with their wedding he'll have it called off. That hardly seems like force to me.I'm not saying Sansa wasn;t under pressure from else where, but at least Tyrion sought her consent before progressing with the wedding.
5386	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-20	Commiting murder is never a morally right decision, regardless of whether the victim "deserves it" in your opinion. Murder is wrong. Period.You were accusing me of being inconsistent, so your views of death every being undeserved aren't relevant to that point.So you believe that neitehr Tywin, the Mountain, the Bastard, or any of those folk should be killed by "good guys"?  That Ned was wrong for killing the NW deserter, etc..? That Crastor wasn't deserving of death either?  That Danaerys was wrong to kill all the slave masters in Astapor, etc..?I mean, I know GRRM likes gray characters, but your morality makes virtually all of them just plain bad.

5387	Woman of War	2013-05-20	So? It's the correct opinion. Even if the majority doesn't share it, who cares?......There is no objectively correct opinion, "opinion" is by nature biased and subjective, that 's why it is called opinion and not fact.If Sansa had not kneeled in the context of the tv situation, after Joffrey had made his poor joke with the stool, she would have shown solidarity with Joffrey's kind of cruel humour. And that was for sure the last thing she wanted. Sansa was proud and strong during the ceremony while Joffrey waited for her to break, to cry and to misbehave. She did not do him that favor.Edit:Wow, I really don't get the criticism at all regarding the wedding.To me, Sansa fans should have loved this one.The removal of the stool by Joffrey presented Sansa with a much different choice than what she had in the book, so her action was different.Here, Joffrey was trying to humiliate Tyrion, and not kneeling would have been cooperating/playing along with Joffrey's joke.Essentially, kneeling was siding with Tyrion rather than Joffrey,And this is actually the first and only episode that I felt Sophie Turner actually acted, and she made me feel more sympathetic to her plight than I ever felt for book Sansa.The misery on her face the who time was evident to me, as were her lack of options.Sorry, I did not see your post in time, Former Lord Of Winterfell, you already wrote what I think, I absolutely agree.

5388	Lady Tippy Wolfsbane	2013-05-20	If you think Sansa would look "bitchy" for refusing to kneel for a man who forced her to marry him, then there's a huge problem with you for identifying with an abuser over the victim. It's fine to feel sympathy for Tyrion during his wedding (believe it or not, even I feel sorry for Tyrion!), but Sansa is the true victim who has been put into a position no child should ever have to be in. I thought Sansa was being "bitchy" in the books when she didn't kneel for Tyrion. I totally understood why she didn't kneel, and I would have done the same thing, but it was still quite mean. Tyrion and Sansa were both victims in that situation, and it's too bad they couldn't hear each others internal monologues because it would have made the situation a lot better for both of them. Again, show versus book, versus RL.  In the RL, a 25+ year old man whose family fills a girl's family, takes her to their house, has her married without her consent, and then has sex with her, is going to jail for a very long time.  His conduct is horribly, horribly out of bounds for what our society deems acceptable.  That's rape, and a crime.  That is not a crime in Westeros, and it's not rape in Westeros, whatever 21st century sensibilities you'd wish to impose there.What Tyrion did in the books was legal, and though the circumstances are on the dicey side legally, that's only because of a disputed succession.  Very few Westerosi would have considered it rape.  In fact, the consensus would have been that Tyrion had the legal right to do it.  Even Sansa, a shitty as those circumstances were, knew that the bedding would be in accordance with Westerosi custom.As for the show v. books, you can't have a 14year old girl disrobe and get fondled, even on HBO, without everyone permanently hating the character who does that, which I very stronlgy doubt would have been consistent with how GRRM views Tyrion.  The few moments of indecision/desire before Tyrion told this 14 year old to stop disrobing still conveys the idea that he wanted to at some level, but thought it was wrong.I agree with most of your points, but do yourself a favor and drop it now. Your words will continue to be twisted until eventually you're painted as an immoral rape apologist that is condoning the "white washing" of Tyrion and the "character assassination" of Sansa. I know that is not what you are trying to say, but trust me, it's a losing battle.
5389	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-20	Isn't that a bit harsh?  I mean, if you've got complex characters, it is inevitable that people are going to have different moral views of those characters, and some folks, fully informed of book Tyrion's acts, my still think him to be a very good guy, while others, equally informed, may feel differently.
	Spoiler Harsh to whom? To Tyrion? Or to the producers of the show who have made him some sort of Ned V.2Oh, and yeh. Not to be a bitch, but back in 'medieval' or 'fantasy land' OR '21st century' if you think that a man that would rape a sex slave, throw up over her and rape her a second time could never be considered a 'very good guy' then I have nothing more to argue, as I find that very offensive. It doesn't MATTER that that is seen as okay in his world, because a man that would do that CAN NEVER BE SIMPLY 'GOOD GUY'.I've been posting on this series since the board before this one, the board before that one, and the board before that.  So it isn't like I'm unfamiliar with the books or online discussions of characters going back more than 15 years.Frankly, I don't care how long you've been discussing this, it all stems from the same source material that we have both read and that we have both seen. How can you deny that they have whitewashed him? They have taken out so many of the shitty things he does and people have even listed all those things in this very thread which so very CLEARLY shows they have whitewashed him.I personally believe that people should be judged in the context of the times in which they live.  Tyrion would be a much shittier guy in the 21st century, but he's not in the 21st century.  I look at his acts of kindness towards people who meant nothing to him (the best way to judge character) and I see him helping Bran and Jon, while knowing that their family hates him.  I seem him being kind to and standing up for Sansa before he had any motive to do so, simply because he thought it was wrong.  And that's after being raised in an immediate family of borderline sociopaths who, except for Jaime, have hated and tormented him since birth.  Given that, I think he's come out more than okay.I can fully accept the good things that Tyrion has done, I really can. His fondess for Jon was quite charming. His helping Bran is selfless. However, the good does not wash out the bad and a lot of the crimes he commits are bad IN HIS WORLD and not only IN OURS. So don't pull the whole 'stop judging him by modern standards' he breaks someones fingers out of malice, he kills someone and makes them into soup out of malice, I can't stress this enough HE RAPES A SEX SLAVE, REALISES WHAT HE HAS JUST DONE IS VERY WRONG, VOMITS ALL OVER HER AND THEN CONTINUES TO RAPE HER AGAIN. This is NOT a 'very good guy' and even though she is a slave in that world it is STILL a disgusting thing and don't ever tell me that just because she's a sex slave what Tyrion does is 'ok' as a character because you can be god damn sure I am judging the hell out of a rapist. He is NOT a nice man. But he has done nice things. He is NOT a good man. But he has done good things. He is NOT an evil man. But he has definitely done evil things so WHY are you denying some of his cruel acts?Also, not raping Sansa just means he is not a monster. Not raping her does NOT make him a good man, it does NOT warrant him a medal of ANY kind. So DON'T tell me how kind he was to a girl he forcibly married and was ready to fuck right before he saw how repulsed she was.I don't want an argument on this scene in regards to marital rape being a crime.The worst stain on him is Tysha.  But as horrible as it was, I think Tywin was the real villain there.  Tyrion was a young boy who'd been abused by that fucker his whole life, and then was placed into this situation that must have been a nightmare for him.  And I've always read his character as having been ashamed of his eventual participation in that rape.  In fact, I think it haunts him, to the point where his participation in that rape is the core reason why he kills his father..Actually, Tysha is one of the things I don't consider to be Tyrion's biggest stain as you say, because I agree that Tywin was the monster here. HOWEVER, I do think as Tyrion participated he became abuser AND victim.So I don't want an argument on Tysha because he has done plenty of evil acts by himself without the brainwashing of his Father.In the context of Westerosi morals, and the times in which he lived, I don't view his actions as the 21st century moral equivalent of some 13 year old boy raping a girl.   Still horrible, but his age, father, etc.., don't make it a thing that makes me judge him adversely more than a decade later.But you're just arguing about something that I never even brought up. So I won't continue here.So to me, Tyrion hasn't been whitewashed because I thought he was a damn good guy to begin with.  His flaws/sins, to me, were minimal given normal Westerosi morals and his horrible, abusive upbringing.  He's a whoremonger, drinker, and willing to live on his family's wealth, so he's not a Ned Stark paragon of virtue with on the show or in the books.I simply VEHEMENTLY disagree. If you are readiing the same material that I am reading I am simply appaled that certain areas of Tyrion's character have been completely missed to you.He IS a Grey character, I NEVER aim to completely DEMONISE him but he IS NOT A GOOD GUY. NO. NO. NO.Don't over simplify a very complex character into either GOOD OR BAD because he does NOT fall into good. He is not a good man.Yes, he has done good things, but fucking SURELY you should come to the conclusion that he is a very grey character, by simply thinking him a hero and a good guy, to me, you are missing soooo much of a very complex character.
edited because all of my response contains lots of spoilers, sorry if anyone saw!

Did he give her choice Why is she the immature one when she stated the truth?Well, actually, he gave her the most choice that was in his power by offering to step aside for Lancel.  My guess is that if Tyrion was running things truly, he'd have sent Sansa home to her family early on.  Butr he wasn't.  Tywin was going to force her to marry someone no matter what Tyrion had to say.But look, you're arguing with me when you should be arguing with book Sansa.  "You were kind to me."  "Suddenly, she was ashamed of her stubborness."  She's regretting actions that you say were correct.  Are you saying that she shouldn't have been ashamed of her stubborness in refusing to kneel?

5391	Penguin king	2013-05-20	And where was his compassion towards her? Did he give her choice Why is she the immature one when she stated the truth? Tyrion couldn`t care less about her feelings, and we all know it. Sansa wasn`t just immature here, she was also paying him back for deceiving her. That line about her feelings is self-centered and she should think about herself, for no one else does. Don`t you remember what Tyrion could have gained with this marriage. remember when Tywin says that Sansa is the prize he couldn`t ever hoped for. This was Tyrion`s `dream wedding`(in terms of politics, ambition and self-centered opinion). Perhaps audience would hate her for not kneeling, but now we are spinning in circles - the writers would be the only one guilty for that. Also, do you honestly believe she needed redemption in any moment of her wedding?What on earth would make you think Tyrion doesn't care about Sansa's feelings?  He saves her from beatings in ACOK, he asks her permision before the wedding, he saves her from the humilation of a bedding. He respects her wishes when she doesn't want to sleep with him.  He clearly has a conscience and feels a great deal of empathy for her. He might not always act with the most noble of intentions, but to say that he doesn't care for her feelings at all is  darkens his character just as much as D&D whitewash him.And It's by no means Tyrion's dream wedding. He spends the reception looking glum and getting drunk. He doesn't even consumate the marriage. What sort of dreams do you think he has?
5392	Sansa in the North	2013-05-20	You were accusing me of being inconsistent, so your views of death every being deserved aren't relevant to that point.I personally Tywin, the Mountain, the Bastard, or any of those folk should be killed by "good guys"?  That Ned was wrong for killing the NW deserter, etc..? That Crastor wasn't deserving of death either?  That Danaerys was wrong to kill all the slave masters in Astapor, etc..?I mean, I know GRRM likes gray characters, but your morality makes virtually all of them just plain bad.Well, actually, yes I think Daenerys was wrong to crucify these slave masters, not because it was wrong in itself, but because she never tried to find out if these people specifically were guilty of crucifying the slaves. She just ordered them to hand over 163 of themselves. We don't know if those were the guilty ones or just the least politically powerful. If she had found out who was guilty first, it would have been lawful execution, under her law, because she was the ruler of the city, just as Ned beheading the deserter was lawful execution in Robert's name, in accordance with the law.  When does Tyrion ever force her to mary him?  He tells her honestly that it was Tywin's idea not his, that if she doesn't marry him Tywin will probably have her married off to Lancel instead, and  If she doesn't want to go through with their wedding he'll have it called off. That hardly seems like force to me.I'm not saying Sansa wasn;t under pressure from else where, but at least Tyrion sought her consent before progressing with the wedding.He tell her that like 5 minutes before the wedding even though he had days to warn her and it's after Cersei has threatened her with beatings if she doesn't go through with it. This is just to salvage his conscience, it was never a real out for Sansa. He wasn't the main forcer? enforcer? here (that was Tywin) but he was one of them, he willingly participated in marrying her off against her will.
5393	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-20	I agree with most of your points, but do yourself a favor and drop it now.

What sort of dreams do you think he has?Okay, saying that Tyrion doesn't care for Sansa's feelings AT ALL is darkening his character, I agree, but he does care for her feelings very little during the wedding. He tugs her skirts, like she's a horse or a dog, he never asks her to kneel, iirc. And he had every intention to consummate the marriage, she was already naked and he had groped her when he noticed/realized that this isn't what she wants.

Heck, perfectly okay for Joffrey to tap some of that as well because he's King, and he makes the laws.Yeah, see, I don't think that just because someone has the biggest army, richest family, or dragons, gives them the moral right to determine right from wrong.  Actions are right or wrong on their own merits, not because someone caught a scimitar lobbed by some moistened bink.  Nor should the right to impose proper punishment be limited to those same people.Who is going to put Joffrey on trial?  Or Tywin?  Or the Mountain?  Your fixation on legalities leaves such putrid specks of humanity immune from justice.
5403	Quiet Sister	2013-05-20	She still does try and push Joffrey off the bridge, but it is harder to get this across on TV, but this bit is there.I (and the other poster, I suppose) didn't mean that scene wasn't in the TV series; it was there and has been brilliantly executed. I will remember Sansa's face, with her determined look and a trickle of blood on her lip, for long. I only meant: where is that Sansa now? I know she perhaps felt off the hook for a while after her betrohdal to Joffrey has been lifted, but she seems too much a comfortable guest in KL than a prisoner.
5404	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-20	He was controlling things throughout a COK, during which he made a public promise in court to return Sansa to her mother. He didn't do it. He sat around for a year until Tywin showed up and then he married her.Your timeline is off.  Had he sent Sansa off earlier she might well have been captured/killed.

If Book!Tyrion was a truly horrible person, he would've acted on so much more than he did. Again, it's not that he's a saint - never a saint, ever - but he does have a redeemable quality or three.

I don't know. Would she have ended up married to Lancel even if it did? Almost certainly.  I'm 99% sure he would have at least tried.He was controlling things throughout a COK, during which he made a public promise in court to return Sansa to her mother. He didn't do it. He sat around for a year until Tywin showed up and then he married her.The Starks and the Lannisters both made unreasonable demands of each other when it came to suing for peace and exchanging hostages. If a reasonable deal coult have been worked out I'm sure he would have released her. Likewise if Brienne has arrived with Jaime while he was still in power.
5408	Mladen	2013-05-20	But look, you're arguing with me when you should be arguing with book Sansa.  "You were kind to me."  "Suddenly, she was ashamed of her stubborness."  She's regretting actions that you say were correct.  Are you saying that she shouldn't have been ashamed of her stubborness in refusing to kneel?No, she felt what she felt, I am not denying it. But this entire situation was forced on her and she had no time, unlike Tyrion to prepare herself for that. So, she tried to find a good thing in miserable situation, but she couldn`t fight her first instinct - not to kneel. I said it already, she grew up in 2 ways during that wedding, as both she-wolf and a person.What on earth would make you think Tyrion doesn't care about Sansa's feelings?  He saves her from beatings in ACOK, he asks her permision before the wedding, he saves her from the humilation of a bedding. He respects her wishes when she doesn't want to sleep with him.  He clearly has a conscience and feels a great deal of empathy for her. He might not always act with the most noble of intentions, but to say that he doesn't care for her feelings at all is  darkens his character just as much as D&D whitewash him.And It's by no means Tyrion's dream wedding. He spends the reception looking glum and getting drunk. He doesn't even consumate the marriage. What sort of dreams do you think he has?That was respond on Tyrion`s behavior prior to their wedding. He knew they had to marry, so Tyrion offering Lancel was empty gesture, and he knew it. He protected her because if the word would get out about the abuses, Jaime would have paid for it. Tyrion is mostly good guy, and as dwarf he has empathy towards others, but in all their marriage, he was completely cut off from her. Because that marriage was doomed the moment it was created in Tywin`s head. I am not discussing Tyrion in general, I am talking about him during wedding and marriage. And please, will we stop giving him golden star for not raping someone? It seems that this has become perverse way to say that everyone should be complemented for not commiting certain crime.
5409	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-20	I posted my comment before your response, and was in no way referring to you personally.ETA: The show does "white wash" Tyrion to a certain extent, but this forum definitely "black washes" him to a certain extent.Oh, okay, I got confused then /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />Agreed. I never saw the book version of this another way. If Book!Tyrion was a truly horrible person, he would've acted on so much more than he did. Again, it's not that he's a saint - never a saint, ever - but he does have a redeemable quality or three.Yeh, and all I ever try to do is make people realise he's also done shitty, horrible things too.
	Spoiler Many people like to conveniently forget the shit Tyrion has done and it just appalls me especially as some people go so far as to say what he did with the sex slave was 'ok'

5410	mrs_serpounce	2013-05-20	I NEVER forget this when talking about Tyrion, I ALWAYS make a point of accepting the good things he has done before I go on to list the SHIT things he has done and he HAS done awful things so I am annoyed that so many people DENY this.I am NOT a MASSIVE ATTACHED FAN to any characters, I have my favourites, the ones I love, and  am fond of many, many others and by extension, I am not a MASSIVE HATER I WILL GO OUT OF MY WAY TO DEMONIZE characters type of person either.I simply read what I read and I can fully recognize goodness and can too fully recognize when someone is being an utter cunt.

5411	Minsc	2013-05-20	So to me, Tyrion hasn't been whitewashed because I thought he was a damn good guy to begin with.  His flaws/sins, to me, were minimal given normal Westerosi morals and his horrible, abusive upbringing.What horrible and abusive upbringing did Tyrion face in regards to Westeros standards?  In how, we get mention of some parents of dwarfs leaving their children out in the wildness to die. Yet, Tywin didn't abandon Tyrion to die and instead provided him food, shelter, education, and financial support furthermore he always attempted to give a place within greater society by entrusting him with being appointed in control of the Rock's sewers. Acting Hand, and Master of the Coin.  Hell, Tywin even arranged for Tyrion one of the most beneficial marriages in the entire realm when forcing Sansa to marry him.Seems to me if we are to look at this by Westeros Standards, then Tywin was an absolutely great father to Tyrion despite him have understandable reason to hate Tyrion.

5413	Sansa in the North	2013-05-20	Well, if it's just the legalities of it all that concern you, then Joffrey's killing of whores, tormenting of Sansa, the marrying of Tyrion to Sansa and hoping he'd bang her lights out is all perfectly fine because it's legal since Joffrey is king.  Heck, perfectly okay for Joffrey to tap some of that as well because he's King, and he makes the laws.Yeah, see, I don't think that just because someone has the biggest army, richest family, or dragons, gives them the moral right to determine right from wrong.  Actions are right or wrong on their own merits, not because someone caught a scimitar lobbed by some moistened bink.  Nor should the right to impose proper punishment be limited to those same people.Who is going to put Joffrey on trial?  Or Tywin?  Or the Mountain?  Your fixation on legalities leaves such putrid specks of humanity immune from justice.Fair enough, that's not what I meant to say at all. The right to impose punishment shouldn't be left to tyrants just because it's legal under their rule, but that right shouldn't be given to everyone and their grandmother either, or you'll have anarchy. And Tyrion had no right to kill Tywin. Doing so did not "raise him above the morality of his times" like you said.That said, I don't blame him for it at all. You said that by my morality all the characters would look irredeemable, but what I was originally arguing for was that Tyrion should either be judged by 21st century standards, in which case he is a rapist, or Westeros standards, in which case he is a kinslayer. I choose to judge him by RL standards, so I don't blame him for killing Tywin, I was just pointing out that murder is wrong and especially wrong judged by Westeros standards. If you judge Tyrion by Westeros standards you must judge him for killing Tywin thou.

5420	BurningCandle	2013-05-20	Part of me in now wondering how are they going to successfully explain and portray her running away with Littlefinger, seeing how they have absolutely diminished the threat she faces in staying with Tyrion while greatly overplaying the danger of Littlefinger thus making her choice to side with LF look like an extremely idiotic move.Moreover, I wonder how are they going to handle the Jaime and Brienne plot seeing how there is no way those two aren't going to get to King's Landing before the Purple Wedding how are they going to explain that.  In how will Jaime be able to reasonably agree to leave Sansa a prisoner in King's Landing if he actually has the possibility to rescue her before she runs away?I think in this case, they don't have to explain it. Just take away the choice. LF is powerful enough to grab her in the chaos of Joff's wedding or have a lackey do it. And he's clearly shown he's ruthless enough to do so.Didn't Tyrion have an innocent person killed? Pretty sure that was his lowest point.I'm not sure if there is another person I'm not thinking of, but if you're referring to the singer, Symon Silver tongue bard, I'd hardly call him innocent. In that instance Tyrion was protecting Shae, if the singer sang that song she would have been killed by Tywin. He may not have realized how far Tyrion would go to protect Shae, but his motive for threatening her life was entirely selfish.

5421	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-20	Harsh to whom? To Tyrion? Or to the producers of the show who have made him some sort of Ned V.2To other posters who have a different interpretation of characters than you do.Oh, and yeh. Not to be a bitch, but back in 'medieval' or 'fantasy land' OR '21st century' if you think that a man that would rape a sex slave, throw up over her and rape her a second time could never be considered a 'very good guy' then I have nothing more to argue, as I find that very offensive. It doesn't MATTER that that is seen as okay in his world, because a man that would do that CAN NEVER BE SIMPLY 'GOOD GUY'.Youv'e done a fantastic job of removing all context from what happened to Tysha.  Well done.Frankly, I don't care how long you've been discussing this, it all stems from the same source material that we have both read and that we have both seen. How can you deny that they have whitewashed him? They have taken out so many of the shitty things he does and people have even listed all those things in this very thread which so very CLEARLY shows they have whitewashed him.As I said, your interpretation depends upon other people giving the same weight to his misdeeds as do you.  I don't.  I don't think he's a paragon of virture, but I do think he's got a better moral compass than most of Westeros.a lot of the crimes he commits are bad IN HIS WORLD and not only IN OURS.So don't pull the whole 'stop judging him by modern standards' he...kills someone and makes them into soup out of malice..."I assume we're talking Symon here, right?  Yeah, I don't have much of a problem with Tyrion offing a blackmailer.I can't stress this enough HE RAPES A SEX SLAVE, REALISES WHAT HE HAS JUST DONE IS VERY WRONG, VOMITS ALL OVER HER AND THEN CONTINUES TO RAPE HER AGAIN. This is NOT a 'very good guy' and even though she is a slave in that world it is STILL a disgusting thing and don't ever tell me that just because she's a sex slave what Tyrion does is 'ok' as a character because you can be god damn sure I am judging the hell out of a rapist.That's nice. But he has definitely done evil things so WHY are you denying some of his cruel acts?I didn't.  I just don't see them the same way as you do no matter how hard you stamp your foot.Also, not raping Sansa just means he is not a monster. Not raping her does NOT make him a good man, it does NOT warrant him a medal of ANY kind. So DON'T tell me how kind he was to a girl he forcibly married and was ready to fuck right before he saw how repulsed she was.That's your opinion, and you're entitled to it.  I see him bedding Sansa as being the expected thing in Westeros, and him refraining from what was his legal right, in a situation in which I think most other lords would have hopped right in, is admirable.  You don't.I don't want an argument on this scene in regards to marital rape being a crime.I'm not sure what the argument could be.  That's clearly not the law or custom in Westeros.I simply VEHEMENTLY disagree. If you are readiing the same material that I am reading I am simply appaled that certain areas of Tyrion's character have been completely missed to you.No, I haven't missed them.  I just see them differently than you do, for whatever reason.He IS a Grey character, I NEVER aim to completely DEMONISE him but he IS NOT A GOOD GUY. NO. NO. NO.  Don't over simplify a very complex character into either GOOD OR BAD because he does NOT fall into good. He is not a good man.Actually, I'll say what I please.  I don't consider Tyrion a perfect man, but I consider him a good man in the context of Westeros, at least before he reaches Essos.Yes, he has done good things, but fucking SURELY you should come to the conclusion that he is a very grey character, by simply thinking him a hero and a good guy, to me, you are missing soooo much of a very complex character.You don't seem very good at listening to what other people are saying.  I have said he was not perfect, which clearly means he is some shade of gray.  But I do think that on the continuum of Westerosi morality, he is more to the good than the bad.  You are distorting what I am saying when you pretend otherwise.
5422	PatrickStormborn	2013-05-20	Didn't Tyrion have an innocent person killed? Pretty sure that was his lowest point. I'm pretty sure his lowest point was when he raped the sex slave in Selhorys.
5423	mrs_serpounce	2013-05-20	I know it was his lowest, I'm simply saying he is not a simple 'good' character, he is so much more complex.Here's the thing: I'm not sure how many people out there actually consider Tyrion to be a "simple 'good' character," even those who like Show!Tyrion. I don't think Show!Tyrion is a "simple 'good' character" either - heck, he spent most of S1 being a significant coward, buying his way out of things, getting knocked out in battles (when, actually, in the book, he actually was braver).IMNSHO, the only "simple 'good' character" in GoT - show and book - is Ned. Everyone else is some shade of grey.I would posit that a lot of people defending him are trying to point out that he's more 'neutral' than good, but when you're sitting there defending a character's positive points, a whole lot of people read into that as you believing that they're a "good" character, when in fact you're actually arguing for "neutral" over "evil."Okay.Thankye /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
5424	Penguin king	2013-05-20	I know it was his lowest, I'm simply saying he is not a simple 'good' character, he is so much more complex.Oh yeah totally. That's what makes him interesting /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' /> It's not that  'good' characters can't be interesting too, I'm a big fan of Brienne for example, but I find myself more drawn to the morally conflicted ones Tyrion. Theon, Sandor, Arya etc.
5425	Lyanna Stark	2013-05-20	Actually, I'll say what I please.  I don't consider Tyrion a perfect man, but I consider him a good man in the context of Westeros, at least before he reaches Essos.I'm sure the families in the Vale the newly armed Mountain clans sacked. the Kings Landing families the Mountain Clans sacked, the Antler men given to Joffrey to torture and the singer he stewed agree with you.  Not to mention Shae. But this should not be about book Tyrion anyway.I vote that in the next episode, Tyrion gets a halo and a set of angel wings.I'm pretty sure his lowest point was when he raped the sex slave in Selhorys.Tssh tssh, Tyrion is a good man, it was surprise sex only. Didn't you know?
5426	Lady Tippy Wolfsbane	2013-05-20	What horrible and abusive upbringing did Tyrion face in regards to Westeros standards?  In how, we get mention of some parents of dwarfs leaving their children out in the wildness to die.Yet, Tywin didn't abandon Tyrion to die and instead provided him food, shelter, education, and financial support furthermore he always attempted to give a place within greater society by entrusting him with being appointed in control of the Rock's sewers. Acting Hand, and Master of the Coin.  Hell, Tywin even arranged for Tyrion one of the most beneficial marriages in the entire realm when forcing Sansa to marry him.Seems to me if we are to look at this by Westeros Standards, then Tywin was an absolutely great father to Tyrion despite him have understandable reason to hate Tyrion.Following that logic, Sansa has had it pretty good as well. Tyrion suffered extreme emotional abuse at the hands of his family, it wasn't horrible by Westerosi standards, but that doesn't diminish the affects of the abuse since Tyrion still carries emotional scars. Tyrion's actions as a result of his abuse may not seem horrible by Westerosi standards, but that doesn't excuse the behaviors. Tyrion's upbringing and his Westerosi sense of morality simply give the reasoning behind his actions, it doesn't excuse his actions. I do not believe that his fans are trying to excuse his "bad" actions, they're simply explaining his reasoning.
5427	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-20	No, she felt what she felt, I am not denying it. But this entire situation was forced on her and she had no time, unlike Tyrion to prepare herself for that.

It seems that this has become perverse way to say that everyone should be complemented for not commiting certain crime.No, because what you keep calling rape and a crime would not have been considered rape and a crime in Westeros.  The way I view that scene, Sansa was willing to "lay back and think of England," because she knew it was her duty.  Tyrion knew it was a his right.  Yet, he refrained, and in that society, I find that admirable.
5428	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-20	I'm pretty sure his lowest point was when he raped the sex slave in Selhorys.Yes, which hasn't "not" happened yet, and therefore cannot be part of the alleged whitewashing of his character.

I'd be shocked at anyone who did (and would definitely have the 'are you mental?' reaction, at that point. But, I think the vast majority of us who are entirely in awe of the outrage have a similar outlook on his shade of gray...
5430	BurningCandle	2013-05-20	Oh gods, then when he starts molesting her, everyone'll be all "serves her right for abandoning Tyrion".I really don't think so, because I think they will change it to where Sansa is nabbed by LF - she doesn't have a choice in the going. I think that makes the most sense since they've made Tyrion more appealing.
5431	Penguin king	2013-05-20	Didn't Tyrion have an innocent person killed? Pretty sure that was his lowest point.If you're talking about Symon silvertongue,he was trying to blackmail Tyrion with infomation that could have put Shae's life in danger, and he was asking for for Tyrion to beat another singer senseless, so that he could play at Joffrey's wedding. He might not have deserved what he got, but all in all I wouldn't call him innocent.
5432	Mendoza	2013-05-20	I think he'll spend his time balancing the cheesemonger's books instead of tormenting poor slaves when he gets to that point. The man doesn't just have the heart of Ned, he also has the brains of his father.
5433	PatrickStormborn	2013-05-20	Yes, which hasn't "not" happened yet, and therefore cannot be part of the alleged whitewashing of his character. I never said it was part of his whitewashing, but it's evidently his lowest moment (so far).Alleged? LMFAO. You'd have to be a seriously delluded stan to not realise just how whitewashed Tyrion is. Honestly, if you think book!Tyrion and show!Tyrion are in any way similar, you're can hardly even call yourself a Tyrion fan.
5434	BurningCandle	2013-05-20	Can we not turn this into a thread about applying 21st century morals to medieval times again? This isn't even really a Tyrion thread, it's a Sansa one. I've said it a million times - you can't isolate Tyrion and judge him, you have to judge the society as a whole for the horrible things it does and encourages others to do.
5435	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-20	I'm sure the families in the Vale the newly armed Mountain clans sacked. the Kings Landing families the Mountain Clans sacked, the Antler men given to Joffrey to torture and the singer he stewed agree with you.  Not to mention Shae. But this should not be about book Tyrion anyway.In Westeros, that's what happens with prisoners.  We see that on all sides during the War of the Five Kings.  The singer blackmailed Tyrion, threatening to expose Shae to Tywin, and we all know what that would have meant for Shae.  Symon was not an innocent, so I hope he enjoyed his time as a bow of brown.  I don't even blame Tyrion for strangling Shae -- she deliberately gave false witness knowing it would send him to his death.  Kind of backfired on da bitch, didn't it?I vote that in the next episode, Tyrion gets a halo and a set of angel wings.Well, I just knew there were some people out there trying to whitewash the guy.....
5436	Penguin king	2013-05-20	I'm sure the families in the Vale the newly armed Mountain clans sacked. the Kings Landing families the Mountain Clans sacked, the Antler men given to Joffrey to torture and the singer he stewed agree with you.  Not to mention Shae. But this should not be about book Tyrion anyway.And I'm sure all the People of the Westerlands who lost their sons at Oxcross, had their cattle stolen and their farms raided would curse the name of Robb Stark.

5438	Lyanna Stark	2013-05-20	Her wolf is dead due to her own flaws.Yes, he flaws jumped out and killed Lady, just like that. IT had nothing to do with Cersei or Robert, or Ned even, noooo it was Sansa's flaws.You sir need to read Sansa the Worst Person in Westeros thread just to get something to agree with.And I'm sure all the People of the Westerlands who lost their sons at Oxcross, had their cattle stolen and their farms raided would curse the name of Robb Stark.Yes, they most likely do. Your point?

5439	Minsc	2013-05-20	Following that logic, Sansa has had it pretty good as well.Tyrion suffered extreme emotional abuse at the hands of his family, it wasn't horrible by Westerosi standards, but that doesn't diminish the affects of the abuse since Tyrion still carries emotional scars. Tyrion's actions as a result of his abuse may not seem horrible by Westerosi standards, but that doesn't excuse the behaviors. Tyrion's upbringing and his Westerosi sense of morality simply give the reasoning behind his actions, it doesn't excuse his actions. I do not believe that his fans are trying to excuse his "bad" actions, they're simply explaining his reasoning.Seeing how the logic that I was addressing argued just that, but I forget when it comes to justify Tyrion we should look at things like how they were in Westeros.  But, when it comes to sympathizing with Tyrion it once again shifts to a modern viewpoint.
5440	mrs_serpounce	2013-05-20	I vote that in the next episode, Tyrion gets a halo and a set of angel wings.Tssh tssh, Tyrion is a good man, it was surprise sex only. Didn't you know?Okay, so I have a question. When so many people on this forum are actually admitting that Tyrion is quite heavily on the greyscale spectrum, and not saying that Tyrion requires a halo, a set of angel wings, and that he's a "good man," what do we have to say to stop being bashed, here?I have never for a second thought that Tyrion was Ned 2.0. Not even in the show. Tyrion does bad stuff. Do we need to stop saying he does good stuff, too?IMNSHO the real beauty of ASoIaF is the fact that Martin explores the entire spectrum of the gray scale, and the concept that, as he says, bad men can good things and good men can do bad things. Just like Penguin King, I actually enjoy watching characters that are morally conflicted evolve. It makes for great reading. And that, overall, I think, is the biggest strength of the series. YMMV. But as someone who sees both sides of Tyrion, I'm wondering when people are going to actually hear the fact that I'm saying that at best, the dude is gray through and through.
5441	Lady Tippy Wolfsbane	2013-05-20	Oh, okay, I got confused then /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />It's okay. Just remember, I'm on your side. I believe that Tyrion is the epitome of the "gray" character, and that's why I love him. He is a joy to read, and makes me questions a lot of things.
5442	Zman1863	2013-05-20	I really don't think so, because I think they will change it to where Sansa is nabbed by LF - she doesn't have a choice in the going. I think that makes the most sense since they've made Tyrion more appealing.I don't know, I think that circumstances in the show are ripe to make the escape look more like it actually does in the books. In the show she now thinks all possibility of LF taking her is gone. At this time in the books she never even knew LF was in the picture. So we are at essentially the same place. She has to have some sort of involvement with an escape plot if the PW is going to occur the same way with the same people involved.
5443	mrunderhill	2013-05-20	I (and the other poster, I suppose) didn't mean that scene wasn't in the TV series; it was there and has been brilliantly executed. I will remember Sansa's face, with her determined look and a trickle of blood on her lip, for long. I only meant: where is that Sansa now? I know she perhaps felt off the hook for a while after her betrohdal to Joffrey has been lifted, but she seems too much a comfortable guest in KL than a prisoner.Ok.Again I think we have to see the difference between the show Tyrion and the book one. Tyrion is a victim in this to. Sansa lashing out at the another victim, even if her emotions are justified would make her look bad to the TV audience.
5444	Lyanna Stark	2013-05-20	In Westeros, that's what happens with prisoners.  We see that on all sides during the War of the Five Kings.  The singer blackmailed Tyrion, threatening to expose Shae to Tywin, and we all know what that would have meant for Shae.  Symon was not an innocent, so I hope he enjoyed his time as a bow of brown.  I don't even blame Tyrion for strangling Shae -- she deliberately gave false witness knowing it would send him to his death.  Kind of backfired on da bitch, didn't it?Good grief, you do need to read the novels again.I am also glad you think a girl who mocks a man and sleeps with someone else deserves death. The domestic abuse victims clearly deserve getting beaten black and blue and strangled for you know, mocking and being unfaithful.As everyone knows, Shae's testimony meant little as she was lowborn. The highborn witnesses counted, Shae was only there to humiliate. But apparently humiliation is worthy of death, no? Shame, shame on Shae.Even if according to you, that mocking, unfaithful Shae deserved death, and to be fair, Simon Silvertoungue could possibly maybe have been a threat one day, what about the Mountain Clans, the Vale families and the Antler men? I guess some people are just born to be cannon fodder so nobody can blame Tyrion for that, right?Well, I just knew there were some people out there trying to whitewash the guy.....Considering that show!Tyrion is so different from book!Tyrion now as to be totally unrecognisable, why not? TV shows needs "good" guy to be a hero, and you have just proclaimed how good Tyrion is. Nevermind that book!Tyrion is far more interesting and conflicted because he is not just "a good guy", but who cares about those things these days? The most important thing is that show!Tyrion isn't doing anything wrong.

5445	Winter's Knight	2013-05-20	Can we not turn this into a thread about applying 21st century morals to medieval times again? This isn't even really a Tyrion thread, it's a Sansa one. I've said it a million times - you can't isolate Tyrion and judge him, you have to judge the society as a whole for the horrible things it does and encourages others to do.These books are not set in medieval Europe. If you want to judge by Westrosi standards, Tyrion is an accursed kinslayer who murdered a father who refused to simply expose Tyrion at birth but raised him as a true born son and not a freak of nature and Brienne is an unnatural woman who deserves a good raping.Seriously?
5446	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-20	I'm pretty sure his lowest point was when he raped the sex slave in Selhorys.That's what I keep repeating, but apparently i'm just stamping my foot.Oh yeah totally. That's what makes him interesting /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' /> It's not that  'good' characters can't be interesting too, I'm a big fan of Brienne for example, but I find myself more drawn to the morally conflicted ones Tyrion. Theon, Sandor, Arya etc.Theon is my favourite character.Sandor and Arya are up there too /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />To other posters who have a different interpretation of characters than you do.All I said is that the show has whitewashed him. Never meant to offend anyone personally, if I have, sorry.Youv'e done a fantastic job of removing all context from what happened to Tysha.  Well done....What? You just did a fantastic job of misreading me as that had nothing to do with Tysha but the sex slave he rapes in Selhorys....I even said my thoughts of Tysha in my post, so I don't know why you're trying to twist things here...As I said, your interpretation depends upon other people giving the same weight to his misdeeds as do you.  I don't.  I don't think he's a paragon of virture, but I do think he's got a better moral compass than most of Westeros.Oh, I definitely think he has a conscience. I still don't think he's a better man than a lot of Westeros though. He is in terms of bastards and broken things, as a lot of Westerosi have awful attitudes towards dwarves and cripples. But his attitude and bitterness towards women and others and his not caring about the small folks and joking about Lollys being raped or whatever still makes him like many of the shitty elite.I assume we're talking Symon here, right?  Yeah, I don't have much of a problem with Tyrion offing a blackmailer.It's still a crime in his world. All I'm saying. As you say ''don't judge by modern standards'' I didn't like the guy either, but it's still a cruel and spiteful thing to do.That's nice.I don't particularly like to be patronised...I didn't.  I just don't see them the same way as you do no matter how hard you stamp your foot.I'm sorry if I came off as heated, I use caps lock a lot and forget how a lot of people read that as shouting /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />I talk a lot with my friends online and always use caps lock because in facebook chat and stuff you cant underline.I'll try to use underlining more in my posts, instead of shouty capitals.That's your opinion, and you're entitled to it.  I see him bedding Sansa as being the expected thing in Westeros, and him refraining from what was his legal right, in a situation in which I think most other lords would have hopped right in, is admirable.  You don't.Actually, I do. I just don't think it makes him a saint, it just makes him a lot better than the horrible lords that WOULD do this in a forced marriage.No, I haven't missed them.  I just see them differently than you do, for whatever reason.Well, this is what puzzles me most if you've seen them and you still think he is (in your own words) a 'very good guy'But each to their own!Actually, I'll say what I please.  I don't consider Tyrion a perfect man, but I consider him a good man in the context of Westeros, at least before he reaches Essos.Before he reaches Essos...I still don't agree. Lyanna Stark listed all the reasons why.You don't seem very good at listening to what other people are saying.  I have said he was not perfect, which clearly means he is some shade of gray.  But I do think that on the continuum of Westerosi morality, he is more to the good than the bad.  You are distorting what I am saying when you pretend otherwise.I never meant to distort what you were saying.Please don't insult me.

5447	Penguin king	2013-05-20	Yes, they most likely do. Your point?That if you blame Tyrion for the loss of life his soldiers caused you should be blaming Robb as well. His war efforts have almost certainly led to more deaths than Tyrion's ever have.
5448	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-20	Alleged? LMFAO. You'd have to be a seriously delluded stan to not realise just how whitewashed Tyrion is. Honestly, if you think book!Tyrion and show!Tyrion are in any way similar, you're can hardly even call yourself a Tyrion fan.What is it with so many of the personal insults coming from those aligned with your position?  Now I'm "seriously deluded"?  How about just growing the fuck up and having a civilized discussion?Nobody is disputed that some of Tyrion's misdeeds -- to date -- have been omitted.  What (I think) most of us are saying is that when placed in context, those misdeeds don't really change our view of the character because we haven't viewed him as an angel anyway.  Therefore, the omission of those misdeeds don't impact our view of the character very much.  If they'd taken away the debauchery, etc., then maybe he'd be a different guy.  But as fo this point, when Tywin used the line from the book about Tyrion being a whoremonger with a certain low cunning and smart mouth, he nailed him just as well on the show as in the books.Or let me try it this way.  I think a character has been "whitewashed" or "assassinated", or whatever other charged term has become possible, when the character as portrayed in the show is so different that he can no longer engage in actions in which he engaged in the books credibly.  I can't think of a single thing Tyrion is supposed to do from here right through ADWD that would be not credible given his character portrayal to date.  He's still Tyrion to me.
5449	Mulled Wino	2013-05-20	You were accusing me of being inconsistent, so your views of death every being undeserved aren't relevant to that point.So you believe that neitehr Tywin, the Mountain, the Bastard, or any of those folk should be killed by "good guys"?  That Ned was wrong for killing the NW deserter, etc..? That Crastor wasn't deserving of death either?  That Danaerys was wrong to kill all the slave masters in Astapor, etc..?I mean, I know GRRM likes gray characters, but your morality makes virtually all of them just plain bad.you are being inconsistent.   tywin did nothing illegal or a moral in westerosi days to deserve murder.  Just like you give tyrion a pass because apparently gang rape was normal and tyrion was only 13 and married.  Imo even in those days, its not normal to participate in the gang rape of someone you love ever.  Even a 13 yr old would know that.  Just tell mean old dad you can't get it up.  Im sure he wouldnt have helped.

As someone who is in your position, agreed wholeheartedly.
5451	SerMixalot	2013-05-20	What on earth would make you think Tyrion doesn't care about Sansa's feelings?  He saves her from beatings in ACOK, he asks her permision before the wedding, he saves her from the humilation of a bedding. He respects her wishes when she doesn't want to sleep with him.  He clearly has a conscience and feels a great deal of empathy for her. He might not always act with the most noble of intentions, but to say that he doesn't care for her feelings at all is  darkens his character just as much as D&D whitewash him.And It's by no means Tyrion's dream wedding. He spends the reception looking glum and getting drunk. He doesn't even consumate the marriage. What sort of dreams do you think he has?TYRION IS THE UNCLE OF THE MAN WHO CHOPPED OFF HER FATHER'S HEADAnything other than utter and intense loathing would be completely....inhuman on Sansa's part.

5455	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-20	Yes, he flaws jumped out and killed Lady, just like that. IT had nothing to do with Cersei or Robert, or Ned even, noooo it was Sansa's flaws.You sir need to read Sansa the Worst Person in Westeros thread just to get something to agree with.If not for Sansa refusing to tell the truth about Nymeria, Lady might still be alive.  Perhaps you go read the Pawn to Player thread where folks can deify her.  Maybe write some San-San poetry or something.My view on Sansa has been the same.  Naive, spoiled, bratty twit in AGOT, self-centered and naive but less spoiled and bratty twit in ACOK and ASOS, no longer self-centered and much less naive girl in AFFC, with a growing maturity and sense of self.  I hope/expect to see some more growth, and a much more active, interesting sotryline- moving forward.  But I can still see her for the character she is at this point in the story rather than the character I think she may become in the future.Of course, naive, spoiled, bratty, or self-centered are clearly words used to describe the Worst Person in Westeros, making her far worse than Littlefinger, Tywin, Gregor, the Boltons, the Freys, or any number of truly nasty and evil people.  Because pointing out any flaws in Sansa steps on delicately painted toes of those who have decided to make her character into some kind of "cause".
5456	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-20	I just can't imagine this character they've presented as Tyrion to kill Shae at this point. 
Unless they make her some cliche, dumb over jealous type of character and she testifies, which kinda ruins their whole 'love story' so far.

I don't see Tyrion as a this awesome guy on the show, and many of my friends that haven't read the books don't view him innocent. Show viewers like/dislike Tyrion for some of the same reasons book readers like/dislike Tyrion. For example, his unwillingness to run across the Narrow Sea with Shae rubbed a lot of show viewers the wrong way. It shows that Tyrion knows he isn't a good guy, and he belongs in the political snake pit that is King's Landing because that is where he feels comfortable. Also, the way he throws his name and money around is very upsetting.
5458	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-20	you are being inconsistent.No, I am not.

Because pointing out any flaws in Sansa steps on delicately painted toes of those who have decided to make her character into some kind of "cause".First, as said, Sansa wasn`t the one that led to Lady`s death. It was Robert, Cersei, Ned, whole bunch of people.Your view on Sansa may haven`t change but she has. From spoiled child to strong young woman, Martin put her through hell in describing her maturity and growing up.As for PTP thread, I would recommend you to actually read it, you know, before judging it. It would be so much easier to deal with people who criticize PTP thread if they atually bothered to read it.
5462	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-20	That may be a function of how justified you think Tyrion's killing of Shae is.  I don't have a problem with it.I never felt she deserved death in the books. He murders her. Yes, what she die was awful, but he murders her. I can't imagine Tyrion in the show murdering this woman that he is supposedly so in love with and to the point, in the show she isn't just playing the girlfriend role, they've made it so she is actually in love with him too.
5463	Lady Tippy Wolfsbane	2013-05-20	bolded: but that's the thing, he just isn't really that same spiiteful creature that Tywin hates in the books.at the moment, he has a 'loving' relationship with shae. and he hasn't shown much low cunning since blackwater, and im sure show watchers have already forgotten that.it doesn't matter if you don't think he's an angel.but it does to show watchers who haven't read the books and they think tyrion is a good guy hero and that sansa is a little bitch.that's when you know something has gone really wrong here.I don't think you're giving the show watchers enough credit.

I think it would be perfectly inline with both of their characters.ETA: The love they have for each other in the show will make it so much more epic to me. That love is what is going to destroy them.

5464	Trebla	2013-05-20	We've had these debates before about whether Sansa's actions truly resulted in her losing her wolf and father. And whether losing Lady symbolized her ceasing to be a true Stark. In fact, we've had this debate in front of GRRM twice.The first time was in St Louis in 2001 while at dinner. GRRM let us debate, smiling and nodding here and there. He also told us why he created Sansa in the first place, because there is always someone in a family that the others don't get along with. He was a bit coy in answering our questions but in the end he did indicate that Sansa did have responsibility for Lady's and Ned's deaths. I reported this to the board and I recall it being dismissed by some. I distinctly recall someone saying, "Well what I think he really meant to say was..."
The second time we had this discussion was in Indy in 2007. There was a boarder there that didn't believe that Sansa's losing Lady symbolized her not being a Stark anymore. The person said so in front of GRRM and GRRM smiled and said, "Doesn't it?"
5465	Mulled Wino	2013-05-20	No, I am not.  Read the slavery analogy if you need help with that concept.Oh, I think Tywin deserved to be murdered for what he did to Tysha.

Maybe you need some help.as to your high and mighty position that you judge characters in the constraints of their time setting (which I have no problem with if you werent wildly inconsistent in applying), 13 is nowhere near extreme youth in westeros.
5466	Sansa in the North	2013-05-20	No, I am not.  Read the slavery analogy if you need help with that concept.Oh, I think Tywin deserved to be murdered for what he did to Tysha.

And a lot of other Westerosi would have concidered what Tyrion did cruel, as well. Because slavery, while okay in essos, is in fact illegal in Westeros and considered wrong by almost everyone. Hence why Jorah had to leave.
5467	Theda Baratheon	2013-05-20	I don't think you're giving the show watchers enough credit.

5468	Warhawk137	2013-05-20	Something I just caught re-watching it, sort of a blink-and-you-miss-it thing.
Recall that the end of the wedding scene was Tyrion basically passing out on the couch.  Then we get the Dany scene, followed by the scene back in KL in the morning when Shae comes into the room.
Note that Tyrion is now covered by a blanket, and is using one of Sansa's dresses as a pillow (which Shae grabs and puts on Sansa).  Which necessarily means that Sansa at least tried to make him comfortable, which was thoughtful of her.
5469	Penguin king	2013-05-20	TYRION IS THE UNCLE OF THE MAN WHO CHOPPED OFF HER FATHER'S HEADAnything other than utter and intense loathing would be completely....inhuman on Sansa's part.And that rebutts what I said how?   My point was Tyrion cares about Sansa's emotions, I never said she had to love him for it.Not that I even agree with what your saying. If your nephew killed my father I wouldn't hate you for it. I probably wouldn't want to marry you, but I doubt I'd feel "utter and intese loathing".  Maybe i'm inhuman....
5470	David Selig	2013-05-20	Or let me try it this way.  I think a character has been "whitewashed" or "assassinated", or whatever other charged term has become possible, when the character as portrayed in the show is so different that he can no longer engage in actions in which he engaged in the books credibly.  I can't think of a single thing Tyrion is supposed to do from here right through ADWD that would be not credible given his character portrayal to date.  He's still Tyrion to me.I really can't agree. TV Tyrion becoming a rapist in Selhorys is something which seems totally impossible to me. TV Tyrion terrorising the slave girl at Illiryo's mansion for the lulz seems almost as improbable. TV Tyrion ordering Symon made into soup also seems a real stretch...

Problem is, I don't think the vast majority of us see it that way, including friends of mine who are Unsullied.If D&D shy away from Tyrion killing Tywin, then yup, all hope for the show is lost. Thankfully, I don't think they've even considered it.To wit, this:TV Tyrion has not been falsely accused of regicide, has not been betrayed and humiliated at trial, sentenced to death, imprisoned in the Black Cells, told the truth about Tysha, found Shae in his father's bed, been called "My Giant of Lannister" by Shae, nor has he strangled Shae then killed his father.

5477	Penguin king	2013-05-20	We've had these debates before about whether Sansa's actions truly resulted in her losing her wolf and father. And whether losing Lady symbolized her ceasing to be a true Stark. In fact, we've had this debate in front of GRRM twice.The first time was in St Louis in 2001 while at dinner. GRRM let us debate, smiling and nodding here and there. He also told us why he created Sansa in the first place, because there is always someone in a family that the others don't get along with. He was a bit coy in answering our questions but in the end he did indicate that Sansa did have responsibility for Lady's and Ned's deaths. I reported this to the board and I recall it being dismissed by some. I distinctly recall someone saying, "Well what I think he really meant to say was..."The second time we had this discussion was in Indy in 2007. There was a boarder there that didn't believe that Sansa's losing Lady symbolized her not being a Stark anymore. The person said so in front of GRRM and GRRM smiled and said, "Doesn't it?"That's interesting. I wouldn't say Sansa was solely responsible for either of those events, but she certainly played her part. But the fact that her refusing to testify in support of her sister almost directly leads to Lady's death has to mean something. The lone wolf dies but the pack survives. Gives me chills for Sansa's future

I hope that I am wrong.Again, I can't help but think how cliche this could turn out, but I hope you're right.I can see Shae becoming increasingly jealous and feeling that she will become "nothing" again, causing her to betray Tyrion as a way to protect herself and her future. I can also see her turning to Tywin(the man Tyrion has painted as the most powerful man ever) as a means for protection, if Tywin approaches her.I can also see Tyrion interpreting her actions as the ultimate betrayal, considering how he feels about her and everything he has done to protect her and be with her. Shae is everything to him at this point.Tyrion's interactions with Tywin are becoming increasingly upsetting for Tyrion. The trial will definitely send him over the edge as far as the rage he feels for his father. Seeing Shae in is father's bed after her testimony would definitely send him into a blind rage.

The context of the situations he gets into themselves provides a lot of the foundation the viewer needs for whether they could see him committing some of the acts he does while in those situations. I think they are setting things up to go through with the Shae killing, although I have my doubts about how well it will work considering the "good Shae" and genuine love route they've gone down. With the bed slaves, I think they have captured enough of the essence of Tyrion that I could see the show version doing those things; but at the same time I am convinced that they won't have him do them. Kind of an odd opinion, I know. /bang.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bang:' />

5482	Silverin	2013-05-20	No, I am not.  Read the slavery analogy if you need help with that concept.Oh, I think Tywin deserved to be murdered for what he did to Tysha.  I think recognition of that that is a higher morality than exists in Westeros, so I don't condemn characters who rise above the morality of the time.But whit that logic what tyrion did is even worse since Tywin actually rose above the morality of Westeros when he decided not to kill tyrion right after he was born! How can you not see that! Yes he did a lot of other things but can you blame him? It was a cruel time, it was in line with the worlds morality! A commoner girl cannot marry a noble, harsh but that happens with commoner girls. It was excepted.He was still a better father than tyrion could ever hope for in that horrible Westerosi time....We should give the "didn't kill my dwarf son after he was born" medal to this wonderful father tywin for being the great man who rose above the morality of its time.Let me start my tyrion should be thankful for having a dad like tywin and what tywin did to him is not abuse since treating dwarfs shitty was the norm of that time.

As for what`s happening in D&D`s heads, well two days ago, I though we`ll see Sansa showing her ruthless Stark side, and yet, we got what we got. A day ago, when someone told me that marriage scene will be all about Tyrion, I told him that`s insane, and yet we got that. And then someone told me that Tyrion will indeed consumate the marriage, and do you know what was my first instinct? I can see them doing it.They surprised me with not allowing Sansa/Tyrion sex, but I am not sure where are they heading with Tyrion. Someone can say that I am `ultimate Sansa fan` but it`s nothing comparing to D&D`s love for Tyrion.

It always stood out to me, and I felt that it was intentional, especially since it led to the death of her wolf. Lady's death was too important for it to mean nothing but that Ned was a sucky dad.
5485	Woman of War	2013-05-20	Okay, so I have a question. When so many people on this forum are actually admitting that Tyrion is quite heavily on the greyscale spectrum, and not saying that Tyrion requires a halo, a set of angel wings, and that he's a "good man," what do we have to say to stop being bashed, here?/agree.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':agree:' />Sigh! What do you Tyrion bashers expect? Should all who dare to root for the character Tyrion sink into the dust and confess they are the evil ones, condoning his sins, nostra culpa, nostra maxima culpa, and you Sansa fans are entitled to grant absolution or not??Those who are intrigued by the character Tyrion love him for not being the simply good guy, they want him to be complex and precisely not like Ned. How often do those interested in Tyrion have to emphazise that they see his flaws, that they value his complexity and therefore are not even interested in "whitewashing".This gets really redundant. Can Sansa only be praised at the expense of Tyrion? Does Tyrion have to be demeaned in order to make Sansa shine? Is the suffering of those two characters a zero sum game! I won! My character had it worse, I told you so! This is a highly stupid competition and a serious oversimplification of Martin's writing.

5493	JonCon's Red Beard	2013-05-20	This "whitewashing" think is getting a little bit... boring.
Anyway, changes on characters sometimes are meant for the sake of other characters. For example, Cersei not being the one ordering Robert's bastards to be killed, it's not because they wanted to make her look good, it was because they wanted Joffrey to be the real evil guy who doesn't even listen to her mother and she's powerless against him.
Fearing Tyrion won't kill Tywin makes no sense, it doesn't help any other character development, for instance. And they're setting up Tyrion to be very in love with Shae, enough for him to be hurt when he finds out she betrayed out of spite (that's what they seem to want for her). They might change the reasons (maybe we'll find out that it was Tywin who ordered to get him Kill during Blackwater) but the action will happen. Tyrion not murdering Tywin is like having Ned surviving.

5495	Kim87	2013-05-20	Then go argue with Sansa herself, who was ashamed in the books for not kneeling.Perhaps there's a huge problem with you being unable to separate a work of fiction from the modern world.Maybe the first time ever I have to agree with Patrick.

The big missing event that supposedly would have boosted her character, the refusal to kneel, is one she almost immediately regretted and was ashamed of.She acted with complete class and dignity during that wedding, while making clear from her demeanor that she was very unhappy about the whole thing.Good for her.

It is not easy especially when you will be ridiculed by it socially and have to fight for your beliefs. It takes a strong moral compass to see through it. I praise Tyrion for not going through with consummating the marriage and I praise Tywin for saving his dwarf son. This does not mean you excuse the bad things they do.As Aemon says, honour (morality) is easy to do when you have nothing to gain. Tyrion had a lot to gain by consummating the marriage and nothing to lose. Only his sense of decency stopped him and I think that should be commended.A good act, is more noble when you have lots to gain and nothing to lose or even much to lose from carrying it out.

We are talking about a 14 year old girl.Lyanna ran away to be with Rhaegar at 15.  Danaerys wed her Sun and Stars at the same age.  Westeros is not the modern world.  While 14 or 15 sounds horrible to us, it is different to them.  Particularly in the context of an initial bedding to cement a marriage.
5500	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-20	Some dwarf babies are killed at birth, but many are not.  I doubt Tywin was moved by compassion or humanity, as opposed to sheer politics, in not killing Tyrion.

And I agree that Tyrion vs. Sansa in the marriage is oversimplification.Many people would ask that people stop throwing the word rape around like it's candy. Having consensual sex with your wife is not a situation where you should be so comfortable using the term rape. Especially in a situation where, you know, nothing actually happened.
5502	JonCon's Red Beard	2013-05-20	Lyanna ran away to be with Rhaegar at 15.and Lyanna died.(sorry, couldn't resist).Yes, their rules about age to marry and sex are different than us, but the cases are different too. While Lyanna probably escaped willingly with Rhaegar, Dany was sold to Drogo and, at least in the show, she was very unhappy and uncomfortable with having sex with him until she started learning how to do it.Now, Sansa eventually agreed to marry Willas. If that wedding had happened, she would have had to sleep with him as well and considering she was daydreaming about their kids, she knew it would happen. Her terror during her wedding night was that she was meant to sleep with a deformed Lannister imp.
5503	Mulled Wino	2013-05-20	Lyanna ran away to be with Rhaegar at 15.  Danaerys wed her Sun and Stars at the same age.  Westeros is not the modern world.

Having consensual sex with your wife is not a situation where you should be so comfortable using the term rape. Especially in a situation where, you know, nothing actually happened.I wasn't even gonna dip my toes in this particular pool but how in the world would that have not been rape? Sansa clearly didn't want it but she didn't really have the option of saying no, so that doesn't make it consensual by any means. By our standards it would have been 100% rape if Tyrion had gone through with it. Yikes, dude.

Why did they have to ruin Sansa /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' /> I'm very much upset by this, because Tyrion has become the New Ned, and let's face it kids, he isn't
And the other thing they did, BECAUSE Tyrion was whitewashed, they had to do the same to Shae, and she was soooo despicable in the books, I can't even believe it, they turned her into Shae, the clever, wise, understanding whore...wut??? 
(The only thing I disagree on with the OP is that Ygritte is unimportant /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />  sorry but Y. is extremely important to Jon and his personal develpment. She also does a lot to drive the plot forward in two of the books; it's very unfair to equate her to a character like Ros, who did next to nothing.... very VERY unfair!)

Is Sansa the worst person in Westeros, or Azor Ahai Reborn?
5507	Rapsie	2013-05-20	No one wants a golden star, just a pass for being a decent human being.Not raping your forced prisoner child bride doesn't make you a decent person. It makes you not a Monster. And please don't confuse D&amp;D with Tyrion's online fanbase. I want to see more of his dark side on the show. Complexity makes a character interesting.I agree, mainly because Show!Tyrion is becoming as boring as Hell.
5508	Mladen	2013-05-20	Many people would ask that people stop throwing the word rape around like it's candy. Having consensual sex with your wife is not a situation where you should be so comfortable using the term rape. Especially in a situation where, you know, nothing actually happened.And this is why this topic should be discussed in the best possible way you can, politely, with dignity and calmness. I understand that having sex with wife isn`t rape, but if the same wife clearly demonstrates you what she thinks of it, that that`s no longer consensual sex, it was under duress. So, basically, if Tyrion have had sex with her, I would clasify it as rape.(The only thing I disagree on with the OP is that Ygritte is unimportant /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />  sorry but Y. is extremely important to Jon and his personal develpment.

It's because we have no soul?
5511	BurningCandle	2013-05-20	These books are not set in medieval Europe. If you want to judge by Westrosi standards, Tyrion is an accursed kinslayer who murdered a father who refused to simply expose Tyrion at birth but raised him as a true born son and not a freak of nature and Brienne is an unnatural woman who deserves a good raping.Seriously?So we're taking the opinion of a band of people who we know for a fact do NOT represent the general consensus on how to treat a lady and using them to justify singling out Tyrion and calling him a monster for participating in forced marriage which all of Westeros agrees is perfectly fine?Don't insult me by taking what I said out of context. The people who say Brienne deserves a good raping are a bunch of lowlife nutcases. Jaime clearly didn't think she deserved it. Eddard Stark wouldn't think that. I doubt Brienne's father would. But I bet none of them would bat an eye if Brienne's daddy hogtied her and dragged her to a wedding against her wishes. If you want to judge Tyrion for marrying Sansa, judge also Eddard Stark for marrying Cat, who had no say in her marriage. Just because he's a decent guy doesn't mean it was okay for her father to force her to marry him.And as to Tyrion's kinslaying, he is guilty. He murdered his father, whether or not his father deserved it. There is no complex debate to be had there, he murdered his father. It happened.And I will say again, this thread is supposed to be about Sansa. Every thread we have that even mentions Tyrion devolves into this same exact argument. I'm really tired of it.Good grief, you do need to read the novels again.I am also glad you think a girl who mocks a man and sleeps with someone else deserves death. The domestic abuse victims clearly deserve getting beaten black and blue and strangled for you know, mocking and being unfaithful.As everyone knows, Shae's testimony meant little as she was lowborn. The highborn witnesses counted, Shae was only there to humiliate. But apparently humiliation is worthy of death, no? Shame, shame on Shae.So you think a woman who willingly sleeps with a man for money is on the same level as a woman who's attacked and raped?  I'm not the one who you originally responded to but I am really tired of this kind of escalation in threads. Shae was a whore. I don't care about her socio-economic background or that times were hard. She was paid to do a job and she did it, and Tyrion was not cruel to her until she betrayed him to his death. The man that abused her if I remember correctly, was her father. You can say her testimony didn't matter if you like, that doesn't prove it was the case.Did Shae deserve to die for betraying Tyrion? She knew her testimony might cause him to die, and was motivated by selfish greed just like Symon. She gave false testimony knowning it could kill a man who'd been nothing but decent to her within the bounds of her chosen profession. She was conspiring in a murder and the only reason it didn't succeed was because Varys & Jaime rescued Tyrion. So I have no pity for her death and also think it was deserved.Now, does that make it less horrifying that Tyrion killed her? No. I for one was absolutely horrified because he purported to love her, and I don't see how you could do that to a woman you love. If he truly loved her that makes it worse, imo. He's saying he can kill people he loves so easily, and with his own hands. That's terrible.Just because Shae is deserving doesn't make her murder less horrible. But she definitely was not a good person, and she certainly didn't act like a victim. If nobody's going to cry over Symon then nobody should cry over Shae.Now the Shae in the show? I am really baffled as to how they will off her, because she is a genuine, caring, decent person. I was surprised how they chose to have her acted. Is Tyrion going to kill her in the show? I honestly don't know. I can say that if he does it will represent a 180 for his character and would imo reverse all the white-washing, because he won't be murdering just a liar who tried to have him killed, but someone who he knows loved him and who he betrayed.

If some scenes should have been sacrificed to tell Sansa's story more fully, it should not have been Ygritte and Jon's ; it would make more sense to cut something else.She's the Great Other.People hate us red hairs. It's because we have no soul?I come from a place where there aren't many redheads, so I don't understand this hatred.

5513	Former Lord of Winterfell	2013-05-20	yet you describe tyrion as having extreme youth at age 13 about 10 posts agoSo?  One addresses moral culpability for wrongdoing, and the other the cultural norm for marriage.
5514	bbstark	2013-05-20	Whether you like it or not, the conversation we had the last time finally showed one thing. Producers love Tyrion, they are ready to make him far better and heroic, and they don`t mind whose character are they going to destroy. This entire episode was about Tyrion and his troubles of marrying Sansa and him doing the right thing. And although they are entitled to do that, I wish they didn`t behave like the high school fan boys who cheer for the best guy. Luckily for all of us, Djawadi`s music was beautifully composed and really cast a light on Sansa`s torments much more than actual text did.		  To expect from the show what we had in books is unrealistic, and I am aware of that. But, we can here see how deep and meaningful GRRM`s writing is. We can see now that although he is man, he is sophisticated soul that can understand each and every of his character. And that`s something producers and writers of this episode miss. And that`s why the show will never reach the depth books have.ok, so I haven't read the whole thread, and I'm not sure when I'll have time to catch up, so forgive me if this was already mentioned, but what if D&D are actually subverting the story a bit?What if they plan on introducing the greyness of Tyrion's character, because of Sansa? Let me try and clarify: in his chapters, we got this sense after the Purple wedding that she betrayed him and *poor Tyrion* was left alone, without anyone, not even his reluctant wife.Well what if instead they turn it around, and focus on his words "I will never hurt you", and find a way for Tyrion to hurt her, as a result, she decides to leave KL? I know it sounds farfetched, especially since they have yet to incorporate an escape route for Sansa, so turning this around to blame Tyrion for going back on his word might be tricky...It came to me when I rewatched the clip before the wedding, when Sansa actually sincerly smiled at him. It wasn't a cold, forced smile at all, it actually conveyed that she is warming to him, or maybe even believes him?  It simply wouldn't make sense at this point that she leaves him so easily, if she actually believes his word, so what is required for her to develop further, is for him to fail on his word.I acknowledge that this would seriously change the course of her development, and in terms of her relationship with men, it's problematic to say the least, considering that the only man in the book that she puts her trust in, is Sandor, and the others are merely there for her to develop inner strength. But the only course I see for the show to get Sansa "there" is if she extends a hand out to Tyrion and HE is the one that fails her...thoughts?ETA: additionally this would finally bring Saint Tyrion down a peg or two, and we could finally move away from the "Sansa is shallow" theme that I can't believe they are still peddling

5515	Rapsie	2013-05-20	So we're taking the opinion of a band of people who we know for a fact do NOT represent the general consensus on how to treat a lady and using them to justify singling out Tyrion and calling him a monster for participating in forced marriage which all of Westeros agrees is perfectly fine?Only people don't think forced marriages are fine. Cat and Robb are horrified and even at Court Lady Tanda etc, feel sorry for what has happened to Sansa. Edit: Also the Lady Hornwood forced marriage was not accepted by anyone and the outrage was huge with Maester Lunwin wondering if the vows even counted.If you want to judge Tyrion for marrying Sansa, judge also Eddard Stark for marrying Cat, who had no say in her marriage. Just because he's a decent guy doesn't mean it was okay for her father to force her to marry him.Ned and Cat had an arranged marriage that they both agreed to. Cat did have a choice, even Lysa says she had a choice about Jon Arryn, which was marry or leave, the same choice Hoster gave the Blackfish.

Cat did have a choice, even Lysa says she had a choice about Jon Arryn, which was marry or leave, the same choice Hoster gave the Blackfish.That's not a choice, that's blackmailing.To be honest, arranged marriages in Westeros (and in our time) are what Margaery said to Sansa: situations in which women can only hope to get the best of their situations. Look at Cat, she was meant to marry Brandon Stark and when he died, they married her to Ned. They learned to love each other, but not always work in that way. Cersei and Lysa were definitely very unhappy.
5518	David Selig	2013-05-20	I knew Sansa would kneel for Tyrion, it was inevitable the way the show has been going this season, making sure Tyrion is the white knight, so I wasn't really annoyed. And of course, they had to get Joff involved in this, removing the bench, to make sure everyone is rooting for Tyrion 100%. Completely predictable.

Cersei and Lysa were definitely very unhappy.It is still a choice. Arranged marriages vary and outside of war, it does seem that the potential brigade and groom get to know each other first in many instances. Also Cat consented to the marriage. Just because it was arranged, did not make it forced.

Cersei and Lysa were definitely very unhappy.It's true, but the difference was that Cat did her duty and she probably agreed to it out of love for her parents The marriage was arranged by her family in order to protect her as well as advance her (or keep her in the same noble position I suppose) She wasn't a pawn in this, she was a player, always prepared for it. Sansa would have been less mortified  happy if her family had arranged the marriage... knowing it was in her best interest and done out of love. Here she is consenting to a marriage by people who are basicaly her enemies. Regardless of Tyrion being so saintly in the show, he belongs to the family that chopped off her father's head.I find it very disappointing that this is not emphasized. She has a good reason to hate the Lannisters, even the "not worst" Lannister.
5522	Mladen	2013-05-20	That's not a choice, that's blackmailing.Still, it`s some choice. Sansa had none. It was either we`ll beat you all the way there, or you`ll go quietly. Although women back them didn`t have much space to choose, Sansa lacked it completely.ok, so I haven't read the whole thread, and I'm not sure when I'll have time to catch up, so forgive me if this was already mentioned, but what if D&D are actually subverting the story a bit?What if they plan on introducing the greyness of Tyrion's character, because of Sansa?

It would be completely different story, and not to mention that I can`t see how they would do that. Also, Sansa didn`t decide to leave KL, she wasn`t free to do that, she escaped it. And also, I don`t know how will it be preformed after Purple wedding, given the fact Cersei thought both of them killed Joffrey. I imagine Tyrion could become more resentful due to this failed marriage, but that shade of grey is still far from TV Tyrion.It's never just about a character in these threads. /ph34r.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':ph34r:' />Well, it`s about show, Tyrion and many more.

She was supposed to be "left alone" and feel lonely and that she doesn't have any friends and that no one is in her corner.I'm not sure she would have gone with Dontos, if Marg and QoT acted like they were still supporting her even after she married Tyrion.Also, from her perspective *deciding to escape* (and she did decide that, she could have chosen to stay if she had reason enough to do that, and I'd say believing Tyrion is going to protect her is a good reason) AT the purple wedding is a just a good circumstance, because people will be distracted enough to pay little attention to her.  She had no clue prior to the PW that Tyrion would stand accused of the regicide, that wasn't her reason to leave.My point is as her standing is in the show right now, she doesn't have the means, or a good enough reason to attempt to escape, and risk the repercussions of getting caught. ESPECIALLY if she believes Tyrion will be good to her, and that her position has actually improved from prisoner to loved wife. What I'm afraid they'll do, is: Tyrion will get blamed for Joff THEN she'll find a way (I'm guessing LF"s machinations) to escape, and once again, it will look like shallow Sansa left poor Tyrion at his most dire hour of need.In contrast they have a chance to do something here that will add grey dimensions to Tyrion's character in favor of Sansa's development: Make it look like HE betrays her, not the other way around.hope that's a bit more clear. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' /> (ps. I'm not hoping I'm right, in fact, I'm sure they will be playing the "shallow Sansa' card for as long as possible, ugh /ack.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':ack:' />
5524	Silverin	2013-05-20	Some dwarf babies are killed at birth, but many are not.Many men don't force12 year old (in the show 14 ) girls to be their wife.I doubt Tywin was moved by compassion or humanity, as opposed to sheer politics, in not killing Tyrion. /rolleyes.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':rolleyes:' />Tywin might be cold but in the context of the world he is a great patriach. After all what a head of a family needs to do "Westeros morals" is ensure the families future, relation etc... compassion has nothing to with Westeros morals. It is a cold world buddy, but in the context of Westeros it is not a requirement....Beside again tyrion wasn't abused since treating dwarfs horribly is normal in Westeros so we cannot talk about abuse.(and since you say consumating the marriage wouldn't have been rape, i say tyrion was never abused with the very same logic, according to "Westeros morals" of course)How  did you not get that I am sarcastic about how that "Westeros moral" is a bullshit especially since none of you crying for the "but in the context of the blah blah blah" use it consistently only when it suits for the favourite character (tyrion, dany, etc etc....)....

5525	Jasta11	2013-05-20	For pete's sake, she also knelt in the books, when the time of the kiss arrived (she felt ashamed about her defiance, even). The overreaction over this is patently ridiculous. It's still the same Sansa; she still defies Tyrion by telling him she doubts he knows how she feels, she still tells him she will never want him. She kneels because, after the stool was taken away, it would have been straight up mean of her not to do so, regardless of Tyrion's so-called white-washing.
5526	Wouter	2013-05-20	As I wrote in the Sansa and Tyrion thread, Sansa noticed that Joffrey took the footstool away, yet didn't kneel of her own volition. When Tyrion actually politiely asked her, she did. Not so terribly different from the books IMO.
Sansa did show grace and strength in the way she held herself throughout the wedding, unlike Cersei who acted much like at the Blackwater again.

It's not the same that Sansa has so much interaction with Marg, who turns away from her in the books when she's married Tyrion, instead of encouraging her before... Sansa in the show is treated like a shallow and weak young girl, not the desperate young girl who is slowly becoming stronger every day while surviving in a completely hostile environment.  Her potrayal in the show is first and foremost as someone weak, and that's unfortunate.
5528	JaTyAdo	2013-05-20	The wedding scene is horrible!!! very horrible!! They didn't made Sansa kneel(which showcase her strength and I'm not even a fan) but they couldn't show this because they already show Sansa being a bitch about how she doesn't like Tyrion for being a dwarf.. And the whitewashing of Tyrion is getting into my nerves, he's looking more like a victim and they even had to make Joffrey take the bench so he could be more pitiable.. /mad.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':angry:' /> I still love the dark grey Tyrion in the books.. It's kinda disappointing because Peter Dinklage is such a good actor that I'm curious about how he would play Tyrion's dark side... this is such a horrible show change...People hate us red hairs. It's because we have no soul?I thought most people in general love redheads.. I am very fascinated in red hair. It's the most beautiful hair color for me.. mostly because such beauty is quite exotic to me too, somewhat radiant, elegant, and seductive..I have a thing for redheads..

5530	Ser Janqarl	2013-05-20	It's quoting time!
"Vh-Vha-Vhag... Fuck me" Ser Davos Seaworth
5531	Kasrith	2013-05-20	IIRC, the Queenscrown scene was was supposed to be in GRRM's episode last week correct? Not seeing it last week was fine and understandable - a simple swap between two scenes - but I really expected it in Second Sons. Alas, once again it was omitted.
I don't get why they would push it back. By cramming it into the 9th episode (which is already going to be eventful on its own), it leaves no time for Bran and Jon to continue onto the Nightfort/Castle Black respectfuly.
Besides the chornological inconsistency of delaying Queenscrown, I felt it also left Bear and the Maiden Fair somewhat uneventful - especially the Jon+Bran storylines.
Not only that, but it seems now that Sam is even too far in his storyline before Nightfort. Unless they show us his meeting with Coldhands, he is pretty much ready now to cross into Nightfort, but the other two haven't even had their moment.
5532	Winterz	2013-05-20	So the TV Show seems to have a different approach on the White Walkers than the books. In the books, the WWs are a lot like killing machines.In GoT prologue, they play with Ser Waymar Royce before killing him and then "setting" his wight on Will. So far as we know, they didn't allow Gared to escape, they just didn't notice him. In the battle of the Fist of the First Men their wights slew everyone they could. As for Puddles, he attacked Sam's group, killed Small Paul and would've killed the rest if given the chance. This makes the books' WWs look pretty bloodthirsty.Now the show's approach differed quite a bit and I wonder, could these be hints that there's some more purpose to them and it's not the termination of humans nor are they wholly evil as the look in the books? Here's the show's differences on the WWs that I recall:In the "prologue" of the first episode, the WWs kill Gared and ser Royce but willingly allow Will to escape;In the battle of the Fist of the First Men they notice Sam but have no interest in killing him whatsoever;Most recently, Shards sees Sam coming at him and simply pushes him away and then approaches Gilly and her baby pretty calm.This facts could only mean one of two things. The WWs don't find weakling/fat humans even worth killing because they despise humans that much or maybe they're just not that evil.Also as for the baby, by the seemingly approach of Shards, can't we assume that he had no intentions of eating the baby and can push this version out of the way? I mean, by the looks of the scene there must be some other importance to the babies considering how calmly he went for him.Anyway, that's what I perceived.
5533	zaphodbrx	2013-05-20	I'm getting kind of annoyed by the fact that by now everyone in Essos seems to speak English. Like they had that whole build up with the Astaphor dude and now its all forgotten. The Yunkish guy speaks English, the three captains of the second sons speak English ( not only to Danaereys but also to each other ), and that includes some Ghiscari ( didn't catch the exact name ) and Daario ( Tyroshi ). In fact in the books Daario explicitly says in ADWD that he can't read 'Westerosi scratchings'.
In the second season everyone in Qarth spoke English although that obviously makes no sense. I don't know, they went out of their way to make this whole language thing and then have no logic behind using it, seems clumsy to me.
5534	JoramunsKazoo	2013-05-20	Tyrion's lashout at Joffery  /ack.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':ack:' />, the silence /eek.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':eek:' /> , the tension... /dunce.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':dunce:' />
A great scene to watch.
Side note: can't wait to see what sort of jape Tyrion plays at Joffery's wedding!
5535	Khal Tommen	2013-05-20	Loved the scene, do you guys think it was a reference to the battle at the wall or (possibly both) the battle yet to occur in the WoW with Roose?
5536	Mulled Wino	2013-05-20	They condensed the storyline too much.  I understand that they had to keep moving forward but I found it odd that they seem to think that nothing important happened on their trip.  I mean obviously they just want to get her to the rw, so they use one two minute scene to neatly wrap up Sandor's character as a good guy and absolutely no more arya development.  
Obviously arya is no priority for these guys, neither is Sandor
5537	Necromancer	2013-05-20	Since Stannis named Robb before Balon (as opposed to the book where Balon is named first), is it safe to assume that Robb will die first?
We know that the Red Wedding is next episode, but we see Yara in the extended season 3 trailer, so she has to turn up in either the next episode or the finale.
Do you think Balon's death will happen near the end of this season or early next season?
5538	Father of Dragons	2013-04-12	The synopsis has been released and it is quite revealing!
"King's Landing hosts a wedding, and Tyrion and Sansa spend the night together. Dany meets the Titan's Bastard. Davos demands proof from Melisandre. Sam and Gilly meet an older gentleman"
The first sentence is quite self-explanatory: the first wedding of the season.
From the second (ha!) sentence and the name of the episode, it is clear that Dany will be introduced to the second (again, ha!) sellword company's captain, Mero.
Davos will be getting that long-awaited visit from the Red Woman.
But the part I've found most interesting is this "older gentleman". From what I can remember, they only meet one person (alone) on the way south. Could this be someone many people have been waiting for? One whose hands are black and cold as ice? One who smells of dead meat and dry blood? One who does not breathe? Coldhands?
5539	TheEvilKing	2013-04-13	Yeah I'm pretty sure it's Coldhands. The only other thing I can think of is the wight of Jeor Mormont or Craster.
Dany will meet Daario this episode.
5540	Aerys Blackfyre	2013-04-16	if that's the synopsis... the title of the episode, I don't really get it... what is it about? who are the second sons?

5541	Ciglon	2013-04-16	if that's the synopsis... the title of the episode, I don't really get it... what is it about? who are the second sons?The Second Sons refer to the mercenary company that the Titan's Bastard leads.
5542	BlueQueen	2013-04-16	Another reason for it to be called second sons is because Tyrion is one.
5543	Nobody of the canals	2013-04-17	I hope it is Coldhands - "older" could just refer to the fact that he died long ago...
5544	KoishNoish	2013-04-17	Seems like a very good episode, although kind of disappointing if this is the first time we see Davos since episode 1. Yet again I really want to see that conversation!

5549	Flayed Starkman	2013-04-22	Yeah and the guy who plays Coldhands aint the guy who played Benjen, so there's one of my favorite theories blown out of the water.That alone shouldn't necessarily blow up the theory. Will be nice to see Coldhands though
5550	melissaphish	2013-04-24	Could the title also be referring to Tyrion, Bran and possibly Ramsay?Also to Tommen
5551	Halfhandyo	2013-04-25	Am I the only one hoping they'll go away from the "include every story in E10" shit, and rather end some stories here? /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' /> That way E9 and E10 would feel less rushed, and can focus more on the great events that will happen there. 
Candidates: 
Sam - I really want them to skip the Bran/Sam meeting.. Really. It would just be to rushed at the end I feel. Read Bran to see my points. I'd like Sam to slay an Other at around 6/7, and then in this one they are truly fucked. However Coldhands appear! And boom, there is Sam story done. I think that would be great. Leaves more material for season 4 aswell. 
Theon - The wildcard, no one really knows what happens to him. How I see it, he will atleast have a scene of being tortured. And hopefully he'll hear the story about Reek, and then we'll understand Ramsay is trying to make Theon to his little pet. Maybe we get Kyra, and the dogs? I'd like that. However, I think Theon wil appear in E10, since it appears they wait with the Bolton reveal until after RW. 
Jaime - I don't think this one. However, I think his story will be pretty wrapped up after E7, and he'll only have a short scene in E10. That's why he's getting so much screentime now. 
Bran - Brans story is a problem for the writers. How I hope they'll handle it; An episode where they realise some northerners are after them (smart viewers will start speculate about Theon then), some scenes with Jojen and warging, and a few scenes with Meera (need the chemistry!). They can postpone most of his wargingshit, his dream, KoTLT and such til Season 4, ending with Coldhands admitting to Bran "I'm your monster Brandon Stark". That way, I think after Summers encounter with Jon, they'll end his story there. Anyone know when that will be? hopefully Brans last scene. 
Stannis - I can see this being the last episode he appears. 
Thoughts?
5552	intheswamp	2013-04-25	Yeah and the guy who plays Coldhands aint the guy who played Benjen, so there's one of my favorite theories blown out of the water.Not necessarily.-The show has already changed actors for other characters and could do the same for Benjen.-Coldhands face could be covered/hidden.-The show could have Coldhands be a different character than the books does.-The older gentleman might not be Coldhands at all.  Though, I hope it is.
5553	Words of Winter	2013-04-27	I wonder if the viewers will be reintroduced to Prince Tommen, to help viewers when the PW happens early next season?  He is a second son, just like Tyrion and there is a short scene in the book at the Tyrion/Sansa wedding where Tommen briefly dances with Sansa.
5554	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2013-04-27	It would be awesome if they dropped a hint of Jon Snow being a second son. Possibly through Bran/Jojen.
5555	Valonqar_	2013-04-28	It would be awesome if they dropped a hint of Jon Snow being a second son. Possibly through Bran/Jojen.Not too much of a reveal. He is Ned's second son (officially at least)
5556	Words of Winter	2013-04-30	I wonder if we'll get a backstory of the Manderlys and their loyalty to the Starks.  Wendel Manderly is cast and he is a second son and if he at the RW it will take the place of so many lords getting cut down.  (Wyllas was taken captive at the RW.)
5557	zeus	2013-04-30	I think we will see coldhands in this episode. . . be interesting to see how they portray him on screen
5558	Moon-Pale Maiden	2013-04-30	I wonder if they'll give coldhands the blue eyes of the wights to more easily illustrate to viewers what Coldhands truly is.
5559	Brewmaster	2013-05-02	I don't know. For it to be Coldhands, they have to get beyond the wall in 2 episodes (episode 5 just aired). I don't see them speeding things up that much. That doesn't leave much room for the few things they do in the journey.
The older gentleman could be a new scene, not in the books. It could also be the Flint clan guy they meet on their journey. I could even be Bloodraven, and could be Bran "meeting him" through dream.
I just don't see how they will have enough Bran scenes in the next couple episodes to get them to the wall.

5563	waaimasjien	2013-05-03	Sam and Gilly are beyond the Wall ...He used his nose to read the synopsis and thought Bran was meeting the older gentleman.
5564	Brewmaster	2013-05-03	Oh shit. Nvm. I read that as "Bran meets an older gentleman".
5565	The Real Summer Islander	2013-05-04	Yeah I'm pretty sure it's Coldhands. The only other thing I can think of is the wight of Jeor Mormont or Craster.Dany will meet Daario this episode.its going to be interesting to see coldhands, and if it has any on screen resemblence to benjen.
5566	Arataniello	2013-05-06	Sam's meeting with an "older gentleman" could be one of several things
 - Coldhands, as per the book.
 - his use of the dragonglass spearhead/dagger on an Other, if this doesn't happen in ep 7.
 - through some re-engineering of the plotlines from the book, the older gentleman is the same old man that the wildlings kill at Queenscrown.  This obviously needs a massive re-arrangement in the timelines and whereabouts of Sam, Jon and Bran's group.
5567	WiDMNDBAMMD	2013-05-06	Anyone see the trailer with Gilly and Sam running through the haunted forest?
	Spoiler  There's ravens everywhere! I'll bet a few gold dragons it's Coldhands

Could also be the oither scene from the book that involves those.
5569	Exar0s	2013-05-07	Yeah and the guy who plays Coldhands aint the guy who played Benjen, so there's one of my favorite theories blown out of the water.Why do people think Coldhands is Benjen? It was stated Coldhands "died a long time ago". Benjen hasn't been dead long at all if he is even dead. I never believed Coldhands to be Benjen in the slightest but I am curious to what everyone thinks about this topic? If you think Coldhands is Benjen, tell me why! If you think Benjen is alive, what the hell has he been doing and when will he re-appear.
5570	Hairlock the Magnificent!	2013-05-07	Spot on Exar0s. Unless GRR is doing his 'gardening' writing method to the max (AKA writing as you go), Benjen CAN NOT be coldhands.
5571	bobbybuilderton	2013-05-07	Why hasn't anyone mentioned that the Hound is a second son?! He will probably be traveling with Arya this episode in order to get to the wedding in time. Perhaps kidnapped in episode 7
5572	wood_dat_aye_could	2013-05-07	Why do people think Coldhands is Benjen? It was stated Coldhands "died a long time ago". Benjen hasn't been dead long at all if he is even dead.

If you think Benjen is alive, what the hell has he been doing and when will he re-appear.This may not be the right thread for this topic, but for ExarOs sake..The only convincing argument that Coldhands is not Ben Stark is the quote from the Child of the Forrest and that "died along time ago" bit.Otherwise, why not Benjen Stark? Coldhands was definitely once a member of the Nights Watch, he had to be in order open the underground passage at the Night Fort. The only other likely candidate would be The Night King, who was also Nights Watch.  Either way, my point is its not impossible that its Benjen, and it makes the most sense.  Could be that Coldhands was someone who actually warged into a wight, and that wight could have been anyone, someone long dead.. heck even the Night King.  We know the Starks can warg, maybe Coldhands is the Night King with Ben Starks warged mind/soul....  Could be a lot things.. and it could be Benjen...However, if Coldhands is not Benjen in all actuality, then Benjen may be shacking up in those secret tunnels and will make a visit to Bran and the Reeds in the next book.. just a guess..
5573	Wethers	2013-05-08	Why hasn't anyone mentioned that the Hound is a second son?! He will probably be traveling with Arya this episode in order to get to the wedding in time. Perhaps kidnapped in episode 7Yep.  Some other second sons other than Mero/Tyrion/Hound/Bran, just for fun:Oberyn Martell (arrives in KL before PW)Euron Greyjoy (bye-bye Balon?)Brynden Tully / BlackfishRamsay Snow/Bolton, second son in books, though perhaps not in showTommen Baratheon/Lannister (doubt any significance in episode)Wendel Manderly (rides with Robb to RW, older bro Wylis captured by Lannisters at Green Fork, but we may not officially see any Manderlys in season 3)Garlan Tyrell (obviously not in show)
5574	WheelofIceandFire	2013-05-08	Why hasn't anyone mentioned that the Hound is a second son?! He will probably be traveling with Arya this episode in order to get to the wedding in time. Perhaps kidnapped in episode 7Yeah, i think Arya and the Hound will appear in this episode. She obviously gets captued by him in episode 7 (from the preview) and i think that will be the last thing we see from them in that episode, so they will need to at least feature a scene where the Hound tells her he is taking her to the Twins (i cant see them having that scene in episode 9, she needs to already be near/at the twins in that ep). I really hope they have a few scenes togetehr in episode 8/9/10. I love their relationship and think it would be great to start building it this season. I also hope that they actually feature them at the RW instead of waiting until the final episode to show Arya arriving at the Twins. It would be more impactful if she appears during the actual episode.And from the preview, it looks like the Hound captures Arya during the night. I was expecting him to attack some of the Brotherhood and take her during the day (i remember seeing the Hound fighting in one of the trailers and it was broad daylight). So it looks like The Hound will be fighting at the Twins. So i expect him to capture her in ep 7, tell her where they are in going in ep 8, show up at the Twins in ep 9 and then maybe a scene featuring the two in the final
5575	Mordos_Kull	2013-05-08	I'm assuming that moment in the promos where someone slams a dagger down onto a table, just before Joffrey turns round is from this episode, as Tyrion does that in the books in reaction to Joffrey's comments during the wedding feast?
5576	Tori Targaryen	2013-05-08	Sky Atlantic have a small synopsis for this episode as:
"Daenerys meets a mercenary on her quest for strength, Davos demands some proof of power from Melisandre, and King's Landing hosts a wedding."
5577	Bayard	2013-05-08	Another reason for it to be called second sons is because Tyrion is one.Not only that, but Sansa is also a second child, so she is the heir to the North. This is the episode where Robb must talk about the will. He will need to name his heir Ned's second son: Jon.
5578	The Monkey	2013-05-08	If the title has a double meaning, and refers to more than the mercenary company, it could be..
Tyrion
Bran
Stannis
Sandor Clegane
Tommen
Am I forgetting someone?
5579	wood_dat_aye_could	2013-05-08	Not only that, but Sansa is also a second child, so she is the heir to the North. This is the episode where Robb must talk about the will. He will need to name his heir Ned's second son: Jon.Jon is a second son, but not Ned's
5580	Bayard	2013-05-09	Jon is a second son, but not Ned'sReally??? are you sure?? you just blew my mind /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />.On the TV show there's absolutely no hint that he's someone else's child, so they can still say that he is Ned's second son.
5581	ShigellaSand	2013-05-09	It would be kind of neat to see Tomman again, just as a reminder that he exists. Maybe he congratulates Tyrion on his wedding, and they somehow get onto the topic of what it's like to be a younger son, how the oldest son gets all the love and attention (whether they deserve it or not)...
5582	Farrellus	2013-05-09	Yeah, I agree that Tommen may pop up in this episode to remind us of his existence. I am still waiting for Tywin to make good on his promise to keep Joffrey in line. Maybe some line to Joffrey about how he could have him killed and put his little brother on the throne? I also agree that Sandor will probably pop up to snatch Arya.
Probably mentioned, but Ramsay is technically Roose's second son also. Roose had a trueborn son who died and it's believed Ramsay poisoned him. So it would not be a surprise for Ramsay to reveal himself, especially prior to the Red Wedding episode. I think Ramsay may turn into a bit of an info dump character since he will probably monologue to Theon every so often about what's happened and what's going on, primarily to make it clear for the audience.
5583	Exar0s	2013-05-10	Really??? are you sure?? you just blew my mind /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />.On the TV show there's absolutely no hint that he's someone else's child, so they can still say that he is Ned's second son.I was always curious of this.On the show you see Robert talking to Ned and he mentions "What was the name of that girl, Jon's mother". Obviously Ned never mentions her name or anything else but I recall her name being Wylla?.Then we have the whole Rhaegar and Lyanna argument. Now this one is super interesting but some things don't add up for me. For example, since when has a Targaryen child been born with dark hair and dark eyes? Yes, they were inbreeding to preserve the bloodline but has no Targaryen ever had children outside the bloodline? Then the whole Rhaegar/Lyanna argument is null and void in the end because Daenerys would have more right to the throne than Jon, correct?It does make more sense then it doesn't though. Ned was as honorable as honorable can be. The books/show showcase Jon as IMO the main character. Why would a bastard child be so important unless there is a huge secret about his mother/birth? Oh well, it will be 10 more years before we know anyway /bang.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bang:' />

Even this look varies a lot, their eyes have many shade of blue-purple, and the hair from white to yellow. I am sure there are plenty more Targs then the ones I know, but we don't have that much info on the first 2 centuries of the post-conquest period. They managed to keep this Targ look because of interbreeding and at first mostly marrying other valyrians: like the Velaryons. Anyway, this is a list of Targs with dark hair:- Bittersteel (Aegon IV's son with a Bracken girl)- Baelor Breakspear (his mother was Dornish, and they had a strong influence on the genes)- Valarr Targaryen the son of Baelor, but he had a yellow streak- Daeron Targaryen the eldest son of Maekar I had sandy brown hair.- Rhaelle was the daughter of Aegon V, I have no idea how she looked, but she is the grandmother of Robert, Stannis and Renly... and they sure as hell don't have yellow hair /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />- Rhaenys Targaryen, the latest, looked Dornish like her mother... she was the daughter of Rhaegar.So, there are plenty of Targs that look different, it doesn't mean anything. And this is the first Targaryen Stark mix, we don't have a precedence (like we did with Baratheon-Lannister in GOT) to know what would the result be.Now, the Targaryen succession rules give precedence to the males before all women. This is a highly debated topic, but Robert had a Targ grandmother, so he had a claim to the throne. Of course, weaker then Viserys, but it could be argued that it was stronger then Dany, a woman. Now Stannis inherited that claim. Anyway, Aegon now has a better claim then Dany, at least until it's proven that he's fake. So, why is Jon important??? well, because he is not a bastard, he was probably the legitimate child of Rhaegar. He had Lyanna for about a year, they had plenty of time to marry.... he was a Targ, so he could be polygamous. A legitimate Jon has a better claim than Dany, not only because he is a male, but also because he comes from Rhaegar's line... and when Aegon dies or is known to be fake, Jon becomes the Targ heir/king. Simple, right?

(Hair color, eye color, etc.)A: Rhaenys looked more like a Martell, Aegon more a Targaryen.
5589	flinn	2013-05-12	I am probably wrong, but in the first book/season when Ned was going through the book, when a Baratheon* married a Targ* the children had the dark black hair. It was part of the proof Ned had, that the Baratheon traits dominated even when matched with Targs as well as the blondes of the Lannisters.

But let's assume that through some miracle, everyone believes that Jon is the real Targaryen heir, would they give him the throne? No /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />. The Tyrells and Lannisters hold the Iron Throne, the king is named Baratheon, so even the Stormlands have an interest in keeping him there. And the other kingdoms don't really care who is king. In the end, it doesn't matter what they believe... the Iron Throne is taken by force.

It looks like Mel will just use Gendry to get his blood via leeches - after sleeping with him probably - and not kill him.This looks like a packed episode. T/S wedding, Arya with Hound, Joffrey gettig mad at Tyrion, Coldhands, Dany and Mero and Daario, Stannis and crew.... I hope they end it with leeches scene as a cliffhanger.No Jamie and Robb? Looks like it.

5601	Daenerys Must Die	2013-05-13	Not expecting Coldhands yet - I know the synopsis kind of implies it but there wouldn't have been a point in Sam showing Gilly the obsidian unless the encounter a WW.. now of course he could slay the whitewalker and then later in the episode they could swarmed by wights and CH could show up..
That seems a bit much for one episode though .. they'll either skip Sam the slayer and we can assume that "older gentleman" has to mean CH which I don't think it does or we get Sam the Slayer and ColdHands to end the season perhaps ep10
Judging by the sneak peak it looks like Sam is encountered by one "thing" which, if you go by the book, doesn't fit with the Coldhands scenario.. would love to see him save them from certain death by Wight with his flock of ravens later rather than dumb it down with a 1v1 meeting next week..

By all practical reasons and more, he is Ned's second son.

- Melisandra 
- Joffrey being a whiney little girl

- Coldhands?
So much to look forward to this week.
5606	Northbound	2013-05-13	Great Daario will make his appearance in the series(take out gun, shoots myself in the head).  Thank the Gods, we can't hear Dany's thoughts; like in the book.
5607	JonDunn	2013-05-13	So there's not going to be any more Robb before Episode 9?
5608	Chuck88	2013-05-13	Looks like a lot of major storylines will take the bench this week.
No Robb, Jon, Theon, Bran or Jaime in by the looks of it. Should still be an awesome episode by the looks of it /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
5609	JonDunn	2013-05-13	So the last chance to build up some of Robb's bannerman who will get killed will be at the RW.  I guess that makes sense since all of them will come to the wedding.  They really need to have a scene establishing how many of them there are
5610	Bizzy	2013-05-13	- DaarioIsn't the short haired guy the Bastard of the Titan?
5611	Tone	2013-05-13	Isn't the short haired guy the Bastard of the Titan?Yeah but Daario is with him, can see him and another guy in the background.
5612	The Mighty Conch	2013-05-13	Isn't the short haired guy the Bastard of the Titan?To reiterate what the guy above me said. If you were to stop the preview at 0:20 then you can see Daario and woman sitting on his lap. its a very quick shot though.
5613	Bizzy	2013-05-13	Yeah but Daario is with him, can see him and another guy in the background.Hm, so the Stormcrows and the Second Sons get merged to an real powerful sellsword army?@ The Mighty ConchOh yes thank.    ... An other whore in Game of Thrones, cool.

Puddles will be featured and Sam the Slayer too. I think they might introduce Coldhands in the episode's end (maybe in the situation you proposed). I'm glad they're finally putting more action into it.

5619	Breaking Bronn	2013-05-13	Arya - Travels with a Dog
King's Landing - Wedding and Bedding

Bran - Jojen on Others ("The NW can't stop them. Kings and their armies can't stop them")? Osha/Rickon departure?
Robb - Lays out the war plan ("Take his home, take his gold, take his power")? Heir talk with Cat?
Jon - Arrival at Queenscrown?
Vale - Oh, Petyr! (?)
Jaime, Theon excluded?
Especially looking forward to the Joff/Tyrion confrontation at the wedding and the Slayer scene.
5620	Gonzalo	2013-05-13	In the trailer Cersei mentions something about "women and children put to the sword" -- does this have a corresponding book scene?
5621	stunningsteve	2013-05-13	Who is 'Puddles' ?The White Walker slain by Sam because after being stabbed with the dragonglass he melts into something that is described as an "icy puddle".I think we will get him and CH later in this episode. Sam and Gilly propably will sit out E9 and in the trailers there was a shot of him emerging out of the well in the Nightfort which would happen in the last episode. CH and the meeting with Bran would propably be too much for E10.

5626	iheartseverus	2013-05-13	what part  of the book is "what did you say" from? I could be wrong, but I believe that's show-only.  They're setting up the open hostility between Tyrion and Joff, so Tyrion will seem all the more suspect when Joff finally bites it.

							Edited by Father of Dragons, 13 May 2013 - 05:32 PM.
5631	Father of Dragons	2013-05-13	-Dany meets the captain of the Second Sons, Mero, the Titan's Bastard
I assume these are Yunkai's powerful friends. I think rather than have different sellsword companies, they will have only one, with Daario being a captain. I think that, in episode 10 (in the battle?), or at the end of this episode, Daario will kill Mero and become captain. This would seem more likely as there is no point in returning when all he did was, unintentionally, help reveal Barristan's identity. When will the dragons be named!?
-The wedding of Tyrion and Sansa
Ah, how I have awaited this. Unfortunately, it will not be as I hoped it would. After all, Moon Boy isn't in the show, and Dontos seems to have disappeared. Since Garlan (and Willas) are nonexistent, it is likely that Loras will dance with Sansa, if he hasn't already stormed out of the hall. I wonder if Tommen will return ... Tyrion likely drove that knife into the table while shouting at Joffrey, which will give him more reason to kill him. I have no idea how Cersei will come up with her line.
-The Dragonstone gang
I think now that Gendry has arrived, they will do the leech thing. Stannis will copy Arya and come up with his own hit list. I am eagerly awaiting Balon's fall and Yara/Asha's reappearance (9 or 10). But they might do something else with Gendry ... Shadow-baby? Balon will die one way or another, we know. Afterwards, Stannis will give his "duty" speech to Davos, while revealing Gendry's presence and purpose in the castle. Will we see Davos' lessons with Shireen? And the long-awaited Davos/Mel chat.
-The She-Wolf and the Dog
Sandor and Arya begin their journey to Riverrun/the Twins. She will try to kill him. I can't remember what stopped her in the books ...
-Samwell Tarly. Other Slayer
Gilly and Sam wind up in a deserted wildling village. They hear a noise at night. Gilly says "Don't go out there" but Sam does anyway. Either Sam successfully kills the Other, and Coldhands shows up at a different point, or Sam tries to kill it and Coldhands saves him, but allows Sam to be known as the one that killed it. The first one is more likely, but I am very confident of Coldhands and Slayer happening. But since Sam showed Gilly the dagger in the recap, I doubt Coldhands will save them.
-No Brienne/Jaime
-No Bran & co.
-No Theon & Boy
-No Robb/Cat/Tullys
-No Jon and the wildlings
However, there are normally only two or three storylines absent each episode, but Brienne and Jaime will definitely not appear

5632	JonDunn	2013-05-13	REALLY hoping for more Robb scenes before the RW episode, hopefully he shows up in the 'Previously on' footage
5633	Jon Black	2013-05-13	I think we will see coldhands in this episode. . . be interesting to see how they portray him on screen...and any possible spoilers.
5634	iheartseverus	2013-05-13	Why does everyone seem to think the 'older gentleman' will be Coldhands and not, say, wighted-Commander Mormont?

5636	go joff go	2013-05-13	I think a wighted Mormont isn't a crazy idea.
5637	Jon Black	2013-05-13	Why does everyone seem to think the 'older gentleman' will be Coldhands and not, say, wighted-Commander Mormont?Good question.
5638	Arkash	2013-05-13	Because there wont be enough time in one episode for an attack of a Wight... an attack of a White Walker (Slayer) and the meeting with Coldhands.
And we know the WW is in according to previews.
5639	Nezzer	2013-05-13	Do you think we will get Balon's death this episode? The burning of the leeches was confirmed to be in this episode, and I think Balon's death would be a great ending to the episode, but, of course, showing his fall from an ambiguous angle, and ending the scene with a shot of Jaqen H'ghar (with the new face) looking at the camera before going away. Seeing Jaqen again would make it a very "holy shit" moment to the non-viewers. I just don't know if they brought Patrick Malahide back just for his death scene. Tom Wlaschiha isn't needed because Jaqen has a new face, and IIRC that face was rendered in CGI.
5640	Mr Hodor	2013-05-13	the promo showed joff vs tywin. Cant wait for that.
5641	shiola	2013-05-13	In the new preview, the way Stannis says "Darkness will devour them all unless I triumph" sounds different than what we heard in another promo, if my memory serves.  I liked the other version a lot more.

Wouldn't we have heard if they had casted Euron by now, though?And on the previous point: I don't think the show ever lingered on the face of the new-Jaqen enough for it to be reasonable to expect that people would remember it. And, that scene was not in the recap for next episode.
5649	Fuse Prime	2013-05-14	Perhaps they don't  show Balon's death or even talk about it until AFTER the RW.  I think it will tip off the TV viewers to Robb's impending doom.

In that scene, I expect Robb and Cat will discuss his will (if it's even gonna happen on the show).Could be early ep 9 before reaching Twins. Expect it to be a Robb-heavy episode, so there's room enough.I believe the talk about Robb's will became after they heard about Sansa's marriage so it's either very late in this episode or early in 9th episode. Robb might send also Blackfish to Riverrun (possibly with Talisa) in same scene. Even if Talisa is pregnant it would be important to legitimize Jon so that's Sansa's son (half-Lannister) wouldn't inherit Winterfell. Robb also heard about Balon's death right after the will talk so they might reveal it the same time.Personally I'm waiting for the leech scene.
5655	ACB	2013-05-14	It could be Couldhands. But, when will Sam kill the criature?
5656	Pinkie Baelish	2013-05-14	Now that I think about it, Balon has to bite it after episode 8. We don't know for sure whether the leeches would be cast into the flames in ep8, but it would be too soon for Balon to die in the same episode. If he dies preferably at the beginning of ep9, we can have Robb's reaction to it, and his decision to look to retake the north as well, just before he gets killed. Balon could die in ep10 after Robb, which would set up the Kingsmoot nicely for next season, but I would personally prefer it if he was the first to go.
5657	YuvalTheVal	2013-05-14	Anyone else dissapointed there's no Robb this episode? I think the RW wouldn't be as powerful if we only get to see Frey for the first time in episode 9.
5658	Arkash	2013-05-14	So... it means 5 big stories only this episode : 
- King's Landing and all those who dwell in the Red Keep.
- Dragonstone team (from Stannis to Gendry, and Shireen, Davos, Melissandre maybe Selyse...)
- Arya and the Hound beginning their journey.
- Sam, Gilly and probably one or two... "gentlemen".
- Daenerys and co meeting the Sellsword companies.
I guess this will be all for the episode.
5659	white wolfpack	2013-05-14	It just occurred to me that the title of this episode would be even more awesome if Robb legitimized Jon.  Lets say Talisa threatens to miscarry, Robb sends her back to Riverrun ith theBlackfish, and in his grief decides to write a will.  Suddenly everyone is back where they belong.
5660	Arkash	2013-05-14	But I dont know if we will see Robb at all this episode.
From the recap, it really seems as we will only have the 5 arcs I mentionned above.
5661	The Mighty Conch	2013-05-14	But I dont know if we will see Robb at all this episode.From the recap, it really seems as we will only have the 5 arcs I mentionned above.I think your five arcs are accurate but they may throw in a short scene with Robb and them at least drawing near or in sight of the Twins. That would be my guess at least.I would be willing to bet that there won't be:Jaime/BrienneTheon/BoyMore questionable:Bran/Reeds (I hope not just because its so boring)Jon/Wildlings

5663	sennahoj	2013-05-14	I'm really curious about the scene with Tyrion and Joffrey (and Tywin). I'm not sure how much is from the books without rereading first, but the atmosphere seems fairly heated. I am looking forward to that confrontation. Tyrion seems very angry and I am also wondering what he did say. I assume that Joffrey's line "Everyone's mine to torment" from the sesaon three preview trailer is taken from the very same scene. I'm not totally sure whether that line or Tyrion's as yet unknown line comes first in that argument, but my money is on Joffrey's.

5665	YTDN	2013-05-14	I'm thinking that Robb will be in the episode, just because we need the 'Take his home, take his gold, take his power' scene, and I don't think we'll have enough time for that in Episode 9 (since according to the previews Robb's storyline starts when they arrive at the Twins, and the episode looks pretty packed already). We might also have a war council type scene where Robb writes his will and sends his bannermen on various errands, including sending Blackfish back to Riverrun. Also, this is unlikely, but if they have Balon's death this episode (maybe straight after the Leeches?) they might have Robb make an emergency change of plan to take back the North.

5672	The Mighty Conch	2013-05-14	Seven Hells, if Robb's will is just bypassed on the show; I will burn a bag of dog poo, on the steps of HBO HQ.I hope you are ready to set ablaze dog feces. Because it is most definitely a possibility.It would be one of the bigger, if not, the biggest departure from the book.
5673	Northbound	2013-05-14	It would be one of the bigger, if not, the biggest departure from the book.I agree.  Robb's will, naming Jon his heir; is one of the bigger focal points on how Jon will grow as a leader and his future as a whole. It would be the largest departure from the books, at this point.
5674	JonDunn	2013-05-14	Or....
if it IS excluded it means that GRRM changed his mind with it and it isn't going to go anywhere in the books, Jon's future may not have anything to do with him being legitimized.
It was never confirmed that Robb went through with legitimizing Jon anyways.
5675	Merope	2013-05-14	Well now that Talisa is pregnant I guess chances are we won't have a Robb-changes-his-will-to-legitimize-Jon-scene anyway. Wouldn't make much sense except if he put in that Jon would be his heir if anything happened to Talisa's child, that kind of thing.
But even if they omit a scene with Robb changing his will now I suppose they could always include it/allude to it afterwards.
Maybe as some kind of a flashback when Stannis urges Jon to take Winterfell. At least that's my wishful thinking.

I would more readily believe that he had it there just as a red herring or a misdirect but definitely not that he wrote it, got it published, then decided that decision doesn't fit with his story. It takes too long to write a book and goes through too many revisions for something like that to happen. GRRM already knows how it ends, and he probably always did. Just like any good authors who write a series.With that being said, it possible they don't legitimize Jon. And I think it is wishful thinking for a flashback considering D&D don't seem like they like to use them.EDIT: spelling

5677	Don Roberto	2013-05-14	I don't see many problems with Robb's will. He could still write his will before the wedding (though this could give too much away about the events during the Red Wedding, since in the books Robb writes his will in fear he could die while assaulting Moat Cailin), and if in the future his heir turns out to be Jon (and if that's of any importance to the story), it could just say so when it's finally revealed. We'd miss Robb and Catelyn's exchange over Jon, but with so much else missing, that doesn't really seem important at all.
Regarding Coldhands, since we already know Sam's fighting an Other this episode and will "meet and older gentleman", would be very unlikely for him to slay an Other, then get attacked by Jeor's or Craster's wights, and yet not be saved Coldhands (which would mean they get yet a third attack later, or their encounter with Coldhands gets changed dramatically).

It'd make the most sense as far as adapting goes. IMO.
5679	Tyrion4President	2013-05-14	The synopsis has been released and it is quite revealing!"King's Landing hosts a wedding, and Tyrion and Sansa spend the night together. Dany meets the Titan's Bastard. Davos demands proof from Melisandre. Sam and Gilly meet an older gentleman"The first sentence is quite self-explanatory: the first wedding of the season.From the second (ha!) sentence and the name of the episode, it is clear that Dany will be introduced to the second (again, ha!) sellword company's captain, Mero.Davos will be getting that long-awaited visit from the Red Woman.But the part I've found most interesting is this "older gentleman". From what I can remember, they only meet one person (alone) on the way south. Could this be someone many people have been waiting for? One whose hands are black and cold as ice? One who smells of dead meat and dry blood? One who does not breathe? Coldhands? the way it looks i bet they will skip Mero and introduce Daario. There would be no point for them to cast Mero if hes pretty much a non factor.
5680	YTDN	2013-05-14	There's a scene in the preview with someone holding Missandei hostage. I think that person is Daario. He's wearing an Unsullied outfit like in the trailer scenes, and I think he took Missandei hostage as a way of getting into Dany's tent.

They will have the assassination attempt on Dany this episode
5682	Arkash	2013-05-14	The will can turn out like : "I name Jon my heir in succession after the children I will have with Queen Talisa Maegyr"... and with her dying at the RW it still is the same.There's a scene in the preview with someone holding Missandei hostage.

5683	SynthFG	2013-05-14	Looks like Mel wants to gut Gendry to raise a stone Dragon and that Davos talks Stannis into demanding proof, so we get the Leaching
Then I bet we see Balon die this episode, Rob the Next and Jof in the Last
5684	Bouldersooner	2013-05-14	PW is not this season
5685	Arkash	2013-05-14	Many show thematics would fit the PW being in Episode 10.
But it is not going to happen... no leaks whatsoever.

5686	YTDN	2013-05-14	The will can turn out like : "I name Jon my heir in succession after the children I will have with Queen Talisa Maegyr"... and with her dying at the RW it still is the same.So basically removing Sansa from the succession and legitimizing Jon. Jon would still come behind any potential children of Robb since children>brothers. I'm pretty sure that in the book Robb addressed any potential children he would have with Jeyne, since he (obviously) didn't know he was going to die or that Jeyne was unwittingly taking birth control. Jon was simply put in the succession, not bumped ahead of Robb's children. In the show there's still the worry that Talisa might miscarry, and they might have Robb make Jon regent for his children if they should inherit before adulthood.
5687	Arkash	2013-05-14	That would be logical ! Preventing Lannisters (via Sansa) to get the North and securing that his eventual children would not be forgotten.
5688	The Mighty Conch	2013-05-14	As much as I love some the ideas created here; I have the fear that the show will somehow find a way to just focus on the Robb and Talisa romance rather than answer any questions about who inherits. Especially since they made her pregnant. The more I think about it actually, the more I think they wont have Robb legitimizing Jon just so the RW will not be suspected by the TV audience anymore. I mean, if they had a scene in the second to last episode of the season (the main consensus is there won't be any Robb&Talisa scenes this week) where they have Robb write his will and puts in a clause for if he were to not have any children that Jon is his heir. Then I think TV audiences would be like...uh oh, something is about to happen. At least the ones who have seen a lot of tv or movies. PLUS I have already read that some unsullied viewers have suspected Robb will die soon.This idea is sounding more and more reasonable to me. Please someone convince me that I must be wrong, PLEASE!
5689	Nezzer	2013-05-14	Many show thematics would fit the PW being in Episode 10.But it is not going to happen... no leaks whatsoever.Yeah, there are no leaks and I don't think there would be enough time to put the PW in episode 10, but they spent the entire season building up to Joff's wedding, and I also have no idea what Jaime and Brienne are going to do in episode 9 and 10. They can't get to KL when Sansa is still there, otherwise Brienne will never have to go on a search for her. I don't want the PW in episode 10, but it seems likely.
5690	JonDunn	2013-05-14	Yeah, I agree with The Mighty Conch.  I'm okay with them figuring out a different way to present Jon as the legitimized heir (if and ONLY if it actually matters in the long run).  I think showing it in episode 8 with two weeks of waiting before episode 9 makes it too obvious that Robb is dead.
5691	Don Roberto	2013-05-14	I highly doubt the Purple Wedding will be featured this season. Not only would it take as much screentime as the Red Wedding, if not more, making ep 10 almost entirely King's Landing-related (and it's a chapter named Mhysa, presumedly it will feature quite a lot of Dany), there's so much they'd have to alter: the dornishmen haven't showed up yet, nor did the Tyrell host, the entire repercussion of the Red Wedding would be cut-off or vastly diminished, as would Tyrion's constant refusal to bed Sansa, Sansa's mourning and descent to hopelessness...I imagine, keeping with the tone of the last episode of previous seasons, that in ep 10 we'll have the "He's dead!" exchange between Joffrey, Tywin, Tyrion and Cersei (most likely omitting Pycelle and Kevan), and the impending arrival of Mace and Oberyn (haven't been cast yet, so we'll probably only see them next season).

How on Earth are they supposed to fit PW there?
5693	Breaking Bronn	2013-05-14	AH you helped me finally put it together. I assumed that it was from the scene where Tyrion asks "how long does it go on?" and Cersei says "until all our enemies are dealt with." But I couldn't figure out how...I suppose that works.That sounds like a post-RW conversation, since Tyrion sympathizes.

But that would only have to be a quick scene. Or maybe just a mention at the end of episode ten by Joffrey along the lines of "we shall be married soon in celebration of MY victory" (which would still be good).But yes, i can't see them doing all of the PW. I suppose the resurrection of Cat would be a good end of the season Finale.

Yes, it makes sense chronologically, but we're still only 1/2 - 2/3 of the way through Storm of Swords, and she still hasn't done anything since besides slowly but surely kill a ton of Freys.  Other than Thoros having the blues, there's not much more story there to bring us through another 3 seasons or so.My only other issue with some of this speculation is that (as Nezzer noted above) I have no idea what they're going to do with Jaime and Brienne.  it'd be kind of odd for them to show up in King's Landing before the PW (and thus before Sansa leaves town).

They can show them almost at KL in the scene where Jaime and Brienne talk about RW in finale.
5698	Nick_Scryer	2013-05-14	^^ I hope Jaime/Brienne don't reach KL before the PW but this set pic of the two of them sure does look like KL or somewhere similar, definitely not Harrenhal or anywhere they've visited so far.http://www.blastr.co...x440-102492.jpg

I don't think they'll mess up the timing of their return- D&D have been pretty faithful with the Jaime & Brienne storyline.
5700	Tone	2013-05-14	Wasn't Dany suppose to have encountered all the crucified slaves on her way to Yunkai? The ones the Yunkish put up when they heard she was on her way, or is that Mereen?
5701	tyrions sliced nose	2013-05-14	Looks like the blackfish is going to the RW and Talisa as well. Blackfish must save her and get her out of the twins somehow im thinking otherwise i have no idea how else they can do it. 
I guess thats what im hoping for but it seems to me that they leaked out that Robb did indeed get jayne pregnant. Which is kinda dissapointing to find out like this tbh.
5702	Envie	2013-05-14	I'm with those that think there's a good possibility that Coldhands and Sam-the-slayer scenes could be combined. It wouldn't change the story that drastically since Sam and Gilly do meet Coldhands soon at this stage in the story and the point at which he should have slain the white walker was way back when he was still with Jon and the rest of the Night's Watch... so they chose to delay that scene and combine it with Coldhands to speed up that story arc. Seems legit.
I'm really curious what that preview scene with Cersei was about, who she's talking about "every man, woman and child" and also why Tyrion is so angry in the bit with Tywin and Joffrey though it seems likely that's where he tells Joffrey he's not going to let him touch Sansa anymore.
I'm relieved to see Gendry tied up instead of being burned or something worse. I'm assuming this means he's the source of the leeches instead of Stannis.
5703	go joff go	2013-05-14	Kudos to the person who suggesested that Cersei is telling the story of the raines of castamere, I think that makes a ton of sense.
5704	Don Roberto	2013-05-14	Well they spent so much time showing Beric and Thoros talk about resurrection and every season ends with massive magical cliffhanger I can see no other possibility than Lady Stoneheart for final scene.One possibility would be Bran and co. crossing the Black Gate. But that would mean no Bran at Queenscrown, since the events of Jon's betrayal will likely be in ep 10, which would be a real pity.
5705	ebevan91	2013-05-14	I wonder what Coldhands will sound like when he talks.
5706	Arkash	2013-05-14	Queenscrown is definitly set for episode 9 ! Look at the synopsis ! /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />
And it is such an epic scene to have Bran and Jon quite together ! Fits the "massive" tone of episode 9 ! 
Then, episode 10 : Jon back at CB and this time Bran meeting again a new character : Sam. 
All of this ending with Bran crossing the door.
Which means they have to cover why will Osha and Rickon abandon them somewhere during episodes 8 and 9.
5707	Don Roberto	2013-05-14	Oh, didn't know that, haven't read ep 9 synopsis. Good to know, seems more likely now that the season will end at the Black Door.
As for Osha and Rickon, they can abandon the party at the Nightfort, before Bran and co. descend the well. How they'll eventually make Wex follow Osha all this time is beyond me, but that's one part of the story I wouldn't mind being altered.

5711	ebevan91	2013-05-14	Did anyone think the "SAY" part in the preview was actually artificially amplified?Could be.The way Stannis says "unless I triumph" sounds different than the way he said it in one of the trailers.
5712	Nezzer	2013-05-14	Did anyone think the "SAY" part in the preview was actually artificially amplified?I don't think it was artificialy amplified. It sounds more like it was cut from another line and edited into the "what did you..." line. In the preview for episode 5 Robb said "Tywin Lannister knows what he needs to do to crush us in a day", when in the actual episode that line is actually two separate and unrelated lines put together.

5714	MarieAntoinette	2013-05-15	Maybe she's reminding Tyrion of (and finally explaining to the audience) the meaning behind "the Rains of Castamere".I have wondered about this line too. I'd like it if it was Cersei who tells the story, so I hope you are correct.
5715	Raven's Teeth	2013-05-15	I may be in the minority here but I really don't want Talisa to be revealed as a spy.  There is enough betrayal in Robb's arc already. Roose Bolton and Walder turn against him.  We don't really need his own wife to do it too.  It just becomes silly IMO.
Perhaps when/if I see it play it out on screen it will make sense, but at the moment I would like them to keep it as it in the books.
5716	Rashtibram	2013-05-15	Looks like the blackfish is going to the RW and Talisa as well. Blackfish must save her and get her out of the twins somehow im thinking otherwise i have no idea how else they can do it.I guess thats what im hoping for but it seems to me that they leaked out that Robb did indeed get jayne pregnant. Which is kinda dissapointing to find out like this tbh.well, since robb doesn't have a lot of recognizable bannermen, it has been suggested that talisa and blackfish will die at the red wedding to emphasize the point that it isn't the north betraying robb, but the freys betraying the north. that would of course change many things, but it's probably the direction they're going.

5718	Arkash	2013-05-15	My guess for this episode :- King's Landing : 5 scenes.- Dragonstone : 3 scenes. Stannis and Davos / Melissandre and Gendry / Stannis, Melissandre, Davos, Gendry.- Daenerys - 2 scenes. Meeting the mercenaries / Daario turning up during the Night.- Sam - 1 scene. Sam the Slayer + Coldhands combined.- Arya - 1 scene. Travels with the Hound + tries to kill him.
5719	Hatbarlives	2013-05-15	I'd be surprised if Robb wasn't in this episode I'd love the ending for them to be entering the Twins (shudder!) Has Cat had her 'show them how it feels to lose the ones they love' yet? She's had so few lines I should remember.
Really looking forward to the wedding too as long as they don't make sansa out to be a bitch for not being nice to Tyrion. I want to see the exchanging of cloaks as its such an important part of sansa's development.
5720	Don Roberto	2013-05-15	well, since robb doesn't have a lot of recognizable bannermen, it has been suggested that talisa and blackfish will die at the red wedding to emphasize the point that it isn't the north betraying robb, but the freys betraying the north. that would of course change many things, but it's probably the direction they're going.Killing Blackfish would be mighty stupid, seeing as he still has a part to play. Not impossible, given the show's tendency of digging holes for no reason, but if they're the least bit careful they'll send Blackfish away before entering the Twins. Perhaps even to bear Robb's will.Now, Talisa is most likely to die, and about time.

The first two seasons were able to effectively establish a few bannermen (Umber, Bolton, Karstark) using very little screen time.  I don't see why they couldn't have done something similar with other bannermen so that they don't waste away a perfectly awesome character.  Given how little the show has focused on the goings on of Robb's split forces (I don't think we'll see much of what happens in Duskendale, for instance), we could easily be sacrificing (as an example) Robett Glover or Helman Tallhart instead.  It's not like it would take much to have added a few more bannermen to some of Robb's "council" scenes.
5722	Colonel Green	2013-05-15	Killing Blackfish would be mighty stupid, seeing as he still has a part to play.We don't know how much of one.  If he's going to the Vale, for instance, it's entirely possible that whatever he does could just be assigned to, say, Bronze Yohn.

It would be such a massive change, and the show's runners haven't dared to do anything like it before.  Plus it seems like it would be such an unlikely plan, sticking a nurse among the hundreds of camp followers and just kind of hope she catches Robb's eye while she's up to her elbows in blood and gore.  And there's a lot in that youtube vid that's silly.  well, since robb doesn't have a lot of recognizable bannermen, it has been suggested that talisa and blackfish will die at the red wedding to emphasize the point that it isn't the north betraying robb, but the freys betraying the north. that would of course change many things, but it's probably the direction they're going.But the Blackfish isn't a northern bannerman, but a nobleman from the riverlands, right?  Anyway I hope they don't kill him off, because we don't know where he's going in the books, and I'd hate to think his death was spoiling the fact that he plays no role in the last two novels.

5724	HopeForSpring	2013-05-15	I agree with the folks that Blackfish is there to take away the will since Maege Mormont and Galbart Glover are no where to be found.
5725	DaveSnow House Stark	2013-05-15	I would think they would have to do Robbs will in this episode. It would seem a little obvious if they do the will right before going into the Twins wouldn't it? They could do a quick scene with Robb and his bannermen, to establish some of them, discuss the will and send the Blackfish away with it.
Or, and I would hate this, there is no will in the tv series?

They could do a quick scene with Robb and his bannermen, to establish some of them, discuss the will and send the Blackfish away with it.Or, and I would hate this, there is no will in the tv series?Robb/Cat arent seen in the preview, or in the recap so i dont think they will be in this episode at all. They will probably be featured very heaivly in episode 9 (Kings Landing will likely be missed out of the episode, unless they decide that they just have to have Peter Dinklage in every ep). Episode 9 will probably only feature one scene from Dany, Jon and Bran and a few between Arya and the Hound as they get closer to the Twins. Which would mean that the rest of the time is spent with Robb/Cat
5727	ExileOnDaytonStreet	2013-05-15	I feel like the will being discussed openly might come off like this on TV:http://www.youtube.c...h?v=H_NnsRerGDY
The only thing that the will really adds that I don't think is kind of implicit is the idea of legitimizing Jon.  I know, I know... that's a pretty big detail that we would all love to see (although I do still wonder how legitimizing Jon changes anything about his NW oath...), but it remains to be seen how much value there is in establishing that right now.  Legitimizing Jon is still something that can come from any number of other routes in the next two books that we haven't seen yet, and there is still a possibility that the story will end with Bran or Rickon as Lord of Winterfell.
That said, they really should've just been including Umber, Glover, Tallhart (anyone that they could cast/recast) in a few of the council scenes that Robb has had with Cat, Edmure and Blackfish, just to establish their value to the North.  Or at least show Grey Wind.  SOMETHING so that we don't have to waste Blackfish by having him die in the RW.

5728	Arkash	2013-05-15	I'm quite sure the Blackfish wont die... now, will he be sent with the will before entering the Twins, will he escape the massacre with Talisa or alone, or will he be taken captive, I dont know !
I really wish for the first option and really fear the second one ! I think it would diminish the impact if someone managed to escape the RW...
5729	Dragonstoned	2013-05-15	I feel like the will being discussed openly might come off like this on TV:http://www.youtube.c...h?v=H_NnsRerGDYGood analogy haha.I was hoping we might get the scene with Robb and Catelyn at Oldstones, the sepulcher of King Tristifer who won ninety-nine battles and lost his last.  They talked about the will and Robb was getting all fatalistic, it was a nice understated scene.  Probably a pipe dream though.
5730	Dove	2013-05-15	Did this imgur album of the preview screencaps get posted? I haven't checked the past couple of pages, sorry if this is redundant.http://imgur.com/a/FJzg5#0
first impressions:
- Daario looking super smug and cocky in the background of that first pic, I love it.
- Gendry uh... uhhhhhh. Just getting leeched, I hope?
- SAM hell yeah
- Tyrion looking right pissed, probably his wedding?
5731	Mason	2013-05-15	As good as it was in the books I don't think the will is going to happen. We got to remember that ASoS was released 13 YEARS AGO and the will has never been brought up since. I think GRRM was undecided on what direction he was going to take for Jon so he put in in just in case to open up potential storylines and then abandoned it. Besides, the will is kinda moot since Stannis or another king/queen can always legitimize him if need be.
5732	Nick_Scryer	2013-05-15	Some of the captions on that Imgur album you posted are hilarious. "Lesbian action" haha
Really excited for this episode. Going to try my best to stay away from the internet on Sunday to avoid the inevitable spoiler leak.
5733	Dove	2013-05-15	Same. No matter how tempting it is there's no fucking way I'm looking at the leaks for the next three episodes, especially E09. I'll analyze that 30 seconds of preview footage to hell and back like a proper closeted nerd but I want the actual episodes to be a complete surprise.
5734	Arkash	2013-05-15	I managed to avoid spoilers for episode 7... I shall do the same for the rest of the season ! Apart from previews and recaps ! And even recaps may be too much...
5735	Khalessi	2013-05-15	Some of the captions on that Imgur album you posted are hilarious. "Lesbian action" hahaYeah poor guy lol.
5736	The Mighty Conch	2013-05-15	Did this imgur album of the preview screencaps get posted?

Just getting leeched, I hope?- SAM hell yeah- Tyrion looking right pissed, probably his wedding?No, its not his wedding. The general consensus seems to be that he is pissed after Joffrey threatens Sansa and claims he can torment anyone he wants.
5737	Where Boars Glow	2013-05-15	I don't know. For it to be Coldhands, they have to get beyond the wall in 2 episodes (episode 5 just aired). I don't see them speeding things up that much. That doesn't leave much room for the few things they do in the journey.The older gentleman could be a new scene, not in the books. It could also be the Flint clan guy they meet on their journey. I could even be Bloodraven, and could be Bran "meeting him" through dream.I just don't see how they will have enough Bran scenes in the next couple episodes to get them to the wall.I think it will just be the Flint guy who feeds them and then ends up dead as Jon and the wildings go past
5738	Nick_Scryer	2013-05-15	No, its not his wedding. The general consensus seems to be that he is pissed after Joffrey threatens Sansa and claims he can torment anyone he wants.I don't think so.Tyrion is pissed because Joff is being a dick during the T/S wedding and trying to strip Sansa to see what she has to offer "His uncle", Tyrion threatens to geld him and that's what's happening her.The torment thing is probably from ep10 after the RW where Joff (At a small council meeting) asks to have Robb's head brought to KL so he can feed it to Sansa at his wedding.
5739	hawkfan	2013-05-15	I know this may be off topic, but when will Dany become aware of Ser Jorah's secret?  I thought this should have already happened.  Is it not being written that way or is it still too early?  (Vague, but spoiler free /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />)

Besides, the will is kinda moot since Stannis or another king/queen can always legitimize him if need be.It may have a smaller effect and impact than people anticipate, it may not even mention Jon at all, but to simply forget about the will altogether would be a pretty big plot hole. It showed up two books ago and never again, yes, partly duo to the fact that those who knew about it are either dead or carrying the will themselves, but Benjen went missing in the first book, and no one doubts he'll still have a part to play.

What Nezzer is talking about is that for the past few episodes, on the early Sunday morning of the new episode, major spoiler still pics begin flooding the net, and pretty much continue all day.  Some of us like spoilers (some hate them), so we started a MAJOR SPOILERS thread in that episode section.  If you look at the 'Bear and the Maiden Fair' section here from last week, scroll through the threads and you'll see that thread.  I assume the same thing will happen this Sunday and for the rest of the episodes this season.  Look for the MAJOR SPOILERS thread for this episode to appear Saturday evening or early Sunday morning.

It was definitely from a conversation about the RW, so it'll 99% be in episode 10- unless they REALLY change stuff around.

5750	Rashtibram	2013-05-16	No, its not his wedding. The general consensus seems to be that he is pissed after Joffrey threatens Sansa and claims he can torment anyone he wants.No, it's clearly his wedding. We know the wedding is this episode anyway, and the scene where tyrion threatens to geld joffrey after he tries to strip sansa is at his wedding.
5751	Minsc	2013-05-16	No, it's clearly his wedding. We know the wedding is this episode anyway, and the scene where tyrion threatens to geld joffrey after he tries to strip sansa is at his wedding.Are they going to actually reference the entire bedding custom in Westeros? (through I could see them doing it only to puff up how awesome Tyrion is)
5752	Serjaimethekingslayer	2013-05-16	Does anyone know if we will see Sam kill the white walker? I hope so. That is a pretty important scene I think.
5753	Nezzer	2013-05-16	Does anyone know if we will see Sam kill the white walker? I hope so. That is a pretty important scene I think.140% sure we will see that this episode. They show Sam talking about dragonglass in the recap..
5754	TomBadgerlock	2013-05-16	140% sure we will see that this episode. They show Sam talking about dragonglass in the recap..Yep. It's a near certainty. I'm not convinced that it will be that big a deal, though? I mean, from the book all I remember was Sam crying and more or less accidentally killing it with the dragonglass.
5755	stannisismyking	2013-05-16	It seems like we will be getting a lot of Stannis this episode. /cool.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt='B)' /> /bowdown.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bowdown:' /> About time too!!
5756	David of Kent	2013-05-16	Seems like a very good episode, although kind of disappointing if this is the first time we see Davos since episode 1.He was in it again a couple of episiodes back talking to Shireen
5757	Jon Black	2013-05-16	140% sure we will see that this episode. They show Sam talking about dragonglass in the recap..i was thinking the same thing until I read the preview under the listing on tv and it says "Sam and Gilly have an encounter with an older man".We'll see...
5758	thewalkindude19	2013-05-16	Why does everyone seem to think the 'older gentleman' will be Coldhands and not, say, wighted-Commander Mormont?There was a shot in one of the previews of Sam and Gilly running from what looked to be a whole heap of ravens.I wonder if Littlefinger at The Eyrie will be featured this episode...
5759	Rashtibram	2013-05-16	Are they going to actually reference the entire bedding custom in Westeros? (through I could see them doing it only to puff up how awesome Tyrion is)Hopefully, I'm counting on it for the Red Wedding. This would be a great place to introduce it.

5761	Where Boars Glow	2013-05-16	Hopefully, I'm counting on it for the Red Wedding. This would be a great place to introduce it.HBO miss a chance at nudity? Come on this will probably get 10 minutes airtime
5762	Arkash	2013-05-16	As for the Coldhands and WW scenes... well, I'm quite sure they will be merged :
Sam defending Gilly from the White Walker... stabbing it, killing it, then, breathing heavily, not understanding what happened... and all of a sudden, all those ravens flying at them... Sam and Gilly running and finding Coldhands, protecting them, talking to them ! 
It will be an epic scene !
As for the bedding ! I really hope we will get it !
5763	SoManyVows	2013-05-16	Given the trailers and the synopsis, it<U+0080><U+0099>s pretty clear that this episode will be much more tightly focused than the last few have been, with four major locations - King<U+0080><U+0099>s Landing, Yunkai, Dragonstone, and Beyond the Wall <U+0080><U+0093> driving the majority of the action. There will be a few quick check-ins in other locations, but those are the most important ones.DaenerysSynopsis: <U+0080><U+009C>Daenerys meets the Titan<U+0080><U+0099>s Bastard<U+0080><U+009D>.Promo: Dany meets with Mero, Prendhal, and Daario. Jorah warns her that they are dangerous; Dany is steely in her resolve: <U+0080><U+009C>A man who fights for gold can<U+0080><U+0099>t afford to lose to a girl.<U+0080><U+009D> Mero tells Dany <U+0080><U+009C>You<U+0080><U+0099>ll all be slaves, unless I save you.<U+0080><U+009D> Daario pulls a woman into his lap. A sellsword (Daario) disguised as an Unsullied holds Missandei hostage.Recap Video: Dany assesses Yunkai<U+0080><U+0099>s defenses, then meets with the Wise Master and delivers terms. The Wise Master says that Yunkai has <U+0080>powerful friends<U+0080><U+0099>.Speculation: This episode will have a lot of Daenerys material, and a substantial amount of it will revolve around absolutely everyone<U+0080><U+0099>s favorite character, Daario Naharis. Early in the proceedings, Dany will sit down with the representatives from the Second Sons and the Stormcrows (given the title of the episode, there<U+0080><U+0099>s a chance that they might be merged into just one company, the Second Sons). Mero and Prendhal are dismissive of Dany, but Daario is intrigued. He sneaks back into Dany<U+0080><U+0099>s camp at night disguised as a member of the Unsullied and takes Missandei hostage to secure an audience with Dany. Once unmasked, he offers to betray Yunkai and bring the Stormcrows/Second Sons over to Dany. Dany decides to give him the opportunity over Jorah<U+0080><U+0099>s strenuous objections. Daario will kill Prendhal to prove his loyalty. Mero is another story. On the one hand, Daario could kill him instead of Sallor (who has been cut) because Barristan has already been unmasked and we don<U+0080><U+0099>t need Mero<U+0080><U+0099>s assassination attempt to reveal him. On the other hand, the show may see value in keeping Mero around as an antagonist to deal with down the line, so we<U+0080><U+0099>ll see. Regardless, after Daario has killed one or both, he returns and swears his sword to Dany<U+0080><U+0099>s service.That<U+0080><U+0099>s a lot to get through, but the synopsis for Episode 9 says <U+0080><U+009C>Daario and Jorah debate how to take Yunkai<U+0080><U+009D>, so Daario has to complete his defection in this episode.King<U+0080><U+0099>s Landing:Synopsis: <U+0080><U+009C>King<U+0080><U+0099>s Landing hosts a wedding, and Tyrion and Sansa spend the night together.<U+0080><U+009D>Promo: Cersei talks with Margaery. Tyrion, at his wedding, gets increasingly drunk. Joffrey takes major offense at a comment that he makes. Tywin stands in response to rising tensions.Recap Video: Margaery and Sansa discuss the upcoming wedding. Tyrion tries unsuccessfully to appease Shae.Speculation: Tyrion and Sansa get married. Joffrey walks Sansa down the aisle as the <U+0080>father of the realm<U+0080><U+0099>. At the feast afterwards, everyone<U+0080><U+0099>s bitter. Margaery <U+0080>congratulates<U+0080><U+0099> Cersei. I really like the idea floating around that Cersei tells the story about the Reynes of Castamere <U+0080><U+0093> it would certainly fit the <U+0080><U+009C>every man, woman, and child put to the sword<U+0080><U+009D> line from the trailer, and illustrate Tywin<U+0080><U+0099>s ruthlessness before <U+0080>The Rains of Castamere<U+0080><U+0099>. Loras storms off in a huff, upset about his impending marriage to Cersei. Sansa sulks and frets while Tyrion gets absolutely smashed. When Joffrey taunts Sansa and his uncle about the bedding, Tyrion pulls out the dagger and threatens to geld him. Tywin calms things down, and Tyrion and Sansa head off to consummate the marriage. After seeing just how young and distraught Sansa is, Tyrion decides that they will wait until she is ready. Give or take a few beats, all of this should be more or less straight from the book.LittlefingerSynopsis: NothingPromo: NothingRecap Video: NothingSpeculation: Since Littlefinger didn<U+0080><U+0099>t show up last episode, roll everything I wrote about this plot last week forward. His proposal to Lysa probably fits better in this week<U+0080><U+0099>s episode anyway, given how much weddings will loom over the proceedings.Jaime and BrienneSynopsis: Nothing.Promo: Nothing.Recap Video: Nothing.Speculation: Jaime and Brienne<U+0080><U+0099>s story for the season is pretty much done. Given that the bear pit scene was originally supposed to air this week instead of last, they may not appear at all in this episode. If they do, I suspect it will be a brief scene of them travelling along the road to King<U+0080><U+0099>s Landing where Brienne questions Jaime about why he came back for her, and they discuss about how far they<U+0080><U+0099>ve come since they left Robb<U+0080><U+0099>s camp.Jon and the WildlingsSynopsis: NothingPromo: NothingRecap Video: NothingSpeculation: Jon and Ygritte will probably take the week off. Queenscrown will happen in Episode 9, and any scenes we get with this group of characters would just be reinforcing things that have already been well-established (Jon and Ygritte are in love, Orell is suspicious and jealous, Tormund has an endless wealth of ribald sex advice to dispense).Robb and CatelynSynopsis: Nothing.Promo: Nothing.Recap Video: Nothing.Speculation: The complete absence of Robb and Catelyn from the promotional materials makes me wonder if they won<U+0080><U+0099>t appear in this episode, which would be a somewhat odd choice given that it<U+0080><U+0099>s the last episode before the Red Wedding and I would think that the writers would want to give them as much exposure as possible without screaming out that they<U+0080><U+0099>re doomed.The best argument I can offer that Robb and Catelyn will not take the week off is that we still have not gotten the scene from the pre-season trailer where Robb talks to Catelyn about his plans to attack Casterly Rock (<U+0080><U+009C>Take his home, take his gold, take his power<U+0080><U+009D>) and Catelyn tells her son to <U+0080><U+009C>Show them how it feels to lose what they love<U+0080><U+009D>. This episode is really the only place left that it can go unless:1) They<U+0080><U+0099>re going to squeeze it into Episode 9 before the Red Wedding starts. That would be an odd choice and make that episode even busier that it already will be. But it could throw non-readers off the scent.2) The scene<U+0080><U+0099>s been cut (which would be odd considering that it was so prominent in the trailers).If this conversation does happen, it would be an ideal setting for Robb and Catelyn to discuss legitimizing Jon. This poses several interesting issues. Given the revelation of Talisa<U+0080><U+0099>s pregnancy, it would seem to eliminate the need for Robb to name an heir. Robb also doesn<U+0080><U+0099>t know about Sansa<U+0080><U+0099>s marriage to Tyrion, and seems unlikely to find out before it happens or before he dies (I doubt the Lannisters sent him a wedding announcement), so the need to disinherit her and have a living heir in place before his child is born isn<U+0080><U+0099>t as likely to motivate the discussion (unless they deduce the Lannister<U+0080><U+0099>s plans on their own and decide to act preemptively). Talisa could miscarry, but that would be a bit sudden and contrived. So there<U+0080><U+0099>s a very solid chance that this plotline has been dropped entirely. But I still think that it will happen, either this episode or next.My theory: Robb decides to legitimize Jon not because he needs an heir, but because he believes that Jon is the only sibling that he has left. We saw earlier in the season that Robb believes that Bran and Rickon are alive, while Catelyn believes them dead. Maybe Robb has come to terms with the idea that even if they are still alive, he isn<U+0080><U+0099>t likely to ever see them again, and that Arya and Sansa are similarly lost. If that<U+0080><U+0099>s the case, he could be motivated to bring Jon back into the fold just so he can start to pull what<U+0080><U+0099>s left of the Stark family back together (he can still use his rationale of sending the Night<U+0080><U+0099>s Watch a hundred men as payment for releasing Jon from his vows). Furthermore, the writers went out of their way to give Catelyn the monologue about her broken promise to love Jon back in Episode 2. It would be strange if they didn<U+0080><U+0099>t pay it off in some way. It would also make for a powerful final conversation between mother and son before the end we all know is coming.DragonstoneSynopsis: <U+0080><U+009C>Davos demands proof from Melisandre.<U+0080><U+009D>Promo: Stannis visits Davos in his cell. Later, Stannis and Davos watch as Melisandre draws blood from Gendry.Recap Video: Shireen teaches Davos how to read. Melisandre tells Gendry that he<U+0080><U+0099>s Robert<U+0080><U+0099>s son.Speculation: Stannis lectures Davos about the divine nature of his mission, but eventually releases him from captivity (and restores him as Hand?) Melisandre brings Gendry to Dragonstone and tells Stannis why he<U+0080><U+0099>s important. I<U+0080><U+0099>m having a hard time seeing where Melisandre<U+0080><U+0099>s seduction of Gendry fits in now, but maybe they sleep together and then Gendry wakes up tied to the bed so that Melisandre can do her work? Davos demanding <U+0080>proof<U+0080><U+0099> from Melisandre sounds like it will be used as a way to introduce the leeches.If the episode ends with Stannis reciting the three names, I have to wonder if they<U+0080><U+0099>ll cut over to Pyke and show Balon Greyjoy actually falling off a bridge (and the Faceless Man who knocks him off). On the one hand, it would remind viewers that Balon exists and still considers himself a king, as he<U+0080><U+0099>s out of sight and out of mind all season. On the other hand, showing his death onscreen in the episode before the Red Wedding could make Robb<U+0080><U+0099>s impending death too obvious, since we<U+0080><U+0099>ve seen plenty of examples of the Lord of Light<U+0080><U+0099>s power. If Balon dies almost immediately after the leeches are thrown in the fire, even casual viewers are going to be on the highest possible alert.Arya and the HoundSynopsis: NothingPromo: The Hound and a captive Arya ride towards the Twins. Arya stands over the sleeping Clegane, preparing to smash his head in with a rock.Recap Video: Arya runs away from the Brotherhood, and is captured by the Hound.Speculation:  The Hound tells Arya that he<U+0080><U+0099>s taking her to her mother and brother at the Twins to ransom her. Arya reminds the Hound how much she hates his guts. She tries to kill him while he sleeps, but he wakes up and stops her. I expect most of the pre-RW events that happen while these two characters are together will be shifted back into Season 4 to give them more to do.TheonSynopsis: NothingPromo: NothingRecap Video: NothingSpeculation: No Theon this week, and thank God. We could all use a break after what happened in the last episode. I strongly suspect that Theon won<U+0080><U+0099>t appear again until the finale, after the Boltons have betrayed the Starks and Ramsay safely unveil his true identity.Sam and GillySynopsis: <U+0080><U+009C>Sam and Gilly meet an older gentleman<U+0080><U+009D>.Promo: A White Walker hunts Sam and Gilly through the forest. Gilly pleads with Sam not to go outside. Sam stands his ground as the White Walker approaches.Recap Video: Sam shows Gilly the obsidian dagger.Speculation: Sam the Slayer, Puddles the Other, and Coldhands. They<U+0080><U+0099>ll likely combine these scenes and have Coldhands show up right after Sam earns his nickname. If they want to raise the stakes even more, Rast and a few Night<U+0080><U+0099>s Watchmen may turn up as wights, but I think that there<U+0080><U+0099>s more than enough material to cover without them.Bran and the ReedsSynopsis: Nothing.Promo: Nothing.Recap Video: Nothing.Speculation:  Bran and the Reeds won<U+0080><U+0099>t appear again until Queenscrown in Episode 9.

5764	Arkash	2013-05-16	(given the title of the episode, there<U+0080><U+0099>s a chance that they might be merged into just one company, the Second Sons).Exactly my thoughts too.Regardless, after Daario has killed one or both, he returns and swears his sword to Dany<U+0080><U+0099>s service.There I dont agree... I think Daario will already bring her the head(s) at the nocturnal and clandestine encounter with her...  not later.My theory: Robb decides to legitimize Jon not because he needs an heir, but because he believes that Jon is the only sibling that he has left.I think Robb will name Jon his heir but will specify that he is the heir after any children he might have with Talisa... thus avoiding Winterfell passing on to Sansa and Tyrion later on (this means Robb will hear of the wedding at KL... but in episode 8 or 9 ?)... and then will send the Blackfish with it, to the North.If the episode ends with Stannis reciting the three names, I have to wonder if they<U+0080><U+0099>ll cut over to Pyke and show Balon Greyjoy actually falling off a bridgeBad Idea, imo... it would suggest that it is really Melissandre who killed him... whereas I always saw it in the book as just... well, she sees they will die but takes no part in it... and doing it the way you suggest would really make like she has a real hand in it.

5765	Don Roberto	2013-05-16	I wonder if Littlefinger at The Eyrie will be featured this episode...Shouldn't be, seeing as he only actually gets to the Eyrie after Joffrey's wedding. Though it's true that show-Littlefinger could teleport back and forth...We still haven't seen Jeyne Poole yet, wonder if Varys will be the one to introduce her.
5766	bobbybuilderton	2013-05-16	As for the Coldhands and WW scenes... well, I'm quite sure they will be merged :Sam defending Gilly from the White Walker... stabbing it, killing it, then, breathing heavily, not understanding what happened... and all of a sudden, all those ravens flying at them... Sam and Gilly running and finding Coldhands, protecting them, talking to them !It will be an epic scene !As for the bedding ! I really hope we will get it !I was thinking it'd be a mass wight attack, he'd take down one, realize they're screwed still, and then Coldhands gets the rest.I was thinking that maybe they'd just have Robb legitimize Jon instead of naming him heir. If he's legitimized, he doesn't need to be named heir because then he automatically comes after Robb's children. Plus it sets up Ramsay's legitimizing. And it fits in with Catelyn's speech about being unable to keep her promise to love Jon as one of her own. So it gives her a reason to argue.
5767	Arkash	2013-05-16	Well, we know a WW is involved, like in the books... and it's a WW Sam kills, not a Wight...
Excellent idea, though about the legitimazing ! That could work perfectly right ! I'm sure we will have a will when the news of Sansa and Tyrion wedding reaches Robb, and he will charge the Blackfish with carrying it...
Which means we wont see the Blackfish holding the siege at Riverrun... but, well...
Or maybe, even, the Blackfish will go back to Riverrun, in a first time, to prepare the voyage to the North with the will and will be besieged there... rather than having him lost in the Neck (like Maege and Galbart), having him blocked at Riverrun would be a nice idea.

5768	Dragonstoned	2013-05-16	Given the trailers and the synopsis, it<U+0080><U+0099>s pretty clear that this episode will be much more tightly focused than the last few have been, with four major locations - King<U+0080><U+0099>s Landing, Yunkai, Dragonstone, and Beyond the Wall <U+0080><U+0093> driving the majority of the action. There will be a few quick check-ins in other locations, but those are the most important ones.DaenerysSynopsis: <U+0080><U+009C>Daenerys meets the Titan<U+0080><U+0099>s Bastard<U+0080><U+009D>.Promo: Dany meets with Mero, Prendhal, and Daario. Jorah warns her that they are dangerous; Dany is steely in her resolve: <U+0080><U+009C>A man who fights for gold can<U+0080><U+0099>t afford to lose to a girl.<U+0080><U+009D> Mero tells Dany <U+0080><U+009C>You<U+0080><U+0099>ll all be slaves, unless I save you.<U+0080><U+009D> Daario pulls a woman into his lap. A sellsword (Daario) disguised as an Unsullied holds Missandei hostage.Recap Video: Dany assesses Yunkai<U+0080><U+0099>s defenses, then meets with the Wise Master and delivers terms. The Wise Master says that Yunkai has <U+0080>powerful friends<U+0080><U+0099>.Speculation: This episode will have a lot of Daenerys material, and a substantial amount of it will revolve around absolutely everyone<U+0080><U+0099>s favorite character, Daario Naharis. Early in the proceedings, Dany will sit down with the representatives from the Second Sons and the Stormcrows (given the title of the episode, there<U+0080><U+0099>s a chance that they might be merged into just one company, the Second Sons). Mero and Prendhal are dismissive of Dany, but Daario is intrigued. He sneaks back into Dany<U+0080><U+0099>s camp at night disguised as a member of the Unsullied and takes Missandei hostage to secure an audience with Dany. Once unmasked, he offers to betray Yunkai and bring the Stormcrows/Second Sons over to Dany. Dany decides to give him the opportunity over Jorah<U+0080><U+0099>s strenuous objections. Daario will kill Prendhal to prove his loyalty. Mero is another story. On the one hand, Daario could kill him instead of Sallor (who has been cut) because Barristan has already been unmasked and we don<U+0080><U+0099>t need Mero<U+0080><U+0099>s assassination attempt to reveal him. On the other hand, the show may see value in keeping Mero around as an antagonist to deal with down the line, so we<U+0080><U+0099>ll see. Regardless, after Daario has killed one or both, he returns and swears his sword to Dany<U+0080><U+0099>s service.That<U+0080><U+0099>s a lot to get through, but the synopsis for Episode 9 says <U+0080><U+009C>Daario and Jorah debate how to take Yunkai<U+0080><U+009D>, so Daario has to complete his defection in this episode.King<U+0080><U+0099>s Landing:Synopsis: <U+0080><U+009C>King<U+0080><U+0099>s Landing hosts a wedding, and Tyrion and Sansa spend the night together.<U+0080><U+009D>Promo: Cersei talks with Margaery. Tyrion, at his wedding, gets increasingly drunk. Joffrey takes major offense at a comment that he makes. Tywin stands in response to rising tensions.Recap Video: Margaery and Sansa discuss the upcoming wedding. Tyrion tries unsuccessfully to appease Shae.Speculation: Tyrion and Sansa get married. Joffrey walks Sansa down the aisle as the <U+0080>father of the realm<U+0080><U+0099>. At the feast afterwards, everyone<U+0080><U+0099>s bitter. Margaery <U+0080>congratulates<U+0080><U+0099> Cersei. I really like the idea floating around that Cersei tells the story about the Reynes of Castamere <U+0080><U+0093> it would certainly fit the <U+0080><U+009C>every man, woman, and child put to the sword<U+0080><U+009D> line from the trailer, and illustrate Tywin<U+0080><U+0099>s ruthlessness before <U+0080>The Rains of Castamere<U+0080><U+0099>. Loras storms off in a huff, upset about his impending marriage to Cersei. Sansa sulks and frets while Tyrion gets absolutely smashed. When Joffrey taunts Sansa and his uncle about the bedding, Tyrion pulls out the dagger and threatens to geld him. Tywin calms things down, and Tyrion and Sansa head off to consummate the marriage. After seeing just how young and distraught Sansa is, Tyrion decides that they will wait until she is ready. Give or take a few beats, all of this should be more or less straight from the book.LittlefingerSynopsis: NothingPromo: NothingRecap Video: NothingSpeculation: Since Littlefinger didn<U+0080><U+0099>t show up last episode, roll everything I wrote about this plot last week forward. His proposal to Lysa probably fits better in this week<U+0080><U+0099>s episode anyway, given how much weddings will loom over the proceedings.Jaime and BrienneSynopsis: Nothing.Promo: Nothing.Recap Video: Nothing.Speculation: Jaime and Brienne<U+0080><U+0099>s story for the season is pretty much done. Given that the bear pit scene was originally supposed to air this week instead of last, they may not appear at all in this episode. If they do, I suspect it will be a brief scene of them travelling along the road to King<U+0080><U+0099>s Landing where Brienne questions Jaime about why he came back for her, and they discuss about how far they<U+0080><U+0099>ve come since they left Robb<U+0080><U+0099>s camp.Jon and the WildlingsSynopsis: NothingPromo: NothingRecap Video: NothingSpeculation: Jon and Ygritte will probably take the week off. Queenscrown will happen in Episode 9, and any scenes we get with this group of characters would just be reinforcing things that have already been well-established (Jon and Ygritte are in love, Orell is suspicious and jealous, Tormund has an endless wealth of ribald sex advice to dispense).Robb and CatelynSynopsis: Nothing.Promo: Nothing.Recap Video: Nothing.Speculation: The complete absence of Robb and Catelyn from the promotional materials makes me wonder if they won<U+0080><U+0099>t appear in this episode, which would be a somewhat odd choice given that it<U+0080><U+0099>s the last episode before the Red Wedding and I would think that the writers would want to give them as much exposure as possible without screaming out that they<U+0080><U+0099>re doomed.The best argument I can offer that Robb and Catelyn will not take the week off is that we still have not gotten the scene from the pre-season trailer where Robb talks to Catelyn about his plans to attack Casterly Rock (<U+0080><U+009C>Take his home, take his gold, take his power<U+0080><U+009D>) and Catelyn tells her son to <U+0080><U+009C>Show them how it feels to lose what they love<U+0080><U+009D>. This episode is really the only place left that it can go unless:1) They<U+0080><U+0099>re going to squeeze it into Episode 9 before the Red Wedding starts. That would be an odd choice and make that episode even busier that it already will be. But it could throw non-readers off the scent.2) The scene<U+0080><U+0099>s been cut (which would be odd considering that it was so prominent in the trailers).If this conversation does happen, it would be an ideal setting for Robb and Catelyn to discuss legitimizing Jon. This poses several interesting issues. Given the revelation of Talisa<U+0080><U+0099>s pregnancy, it would seem to eliminate the need for Robb to name an heir. Robb also doesn<U+0080><U+0099>t know about Sansa<U+0080><U+0099>s marriage to Tyrion, and seems unlikely to find out before it happens or before he dies (I doubt the Lannisters sent him a wedding announcement), so the need to disinherit her and have a living heir in place before his child is born isn<U+0080><U+0099>t as likely to motivate the discussion (unless they deduce the Lannister<U+0080><U+0099>s plans on their own and decide to act preemptively). Talisa could miscarry, but that would be a bit sudden and contrived. So there<U+0080><U+0099>s a very solid chance that this plotline has been dropped entirely. But I still think that it will happen, either this episode or next.My theory: Robb decides to legitimize Jon not because he needs an heir, but because he believes that Jon is the only sibling that he has left. We saw earlier in the season that Robb believes that Bran and Rickon are alive, while Catelyn believes them dead. Maybe Robb has come to terms with the idea that even if they are still alive, he isn<U+0080><U+0099>t likely to ever see them again, and that Arya and Sansa are similarly lost. If that<U+0080><U+0099>s the case, he could be motivated to bring Jon back into the fold just so he can start to pull what<U+0080><U+0099>s left of the Stark family back together (he can still use his rationale of sending the Night<U+0080><U+0099>s Watch a hundred men as payment for releasing Jon from his vows). Furthermore, the writers went out of their way to give Catelyn the monologue about her broken promise to love Jon back in Episode 2. It would be strange if they didn<U+0080><U+0099>t pay it off in some way. It would also make for a powerful final conversation between mother and son before the end we all know is coming.DragonstoneSynopsis: <U+0080><U+009C>Davos demands proof from Melisandre.<U+0080><U+009D>Promo: Stannis visits Davos in his cell. Later, Stannis and Davos watch as Melisandre draws blood from Gendry.Recap Video: Shireen teaches Davos how to read. Melisandre tells Gendry that he<U+0080><U+0099>s Robert<U+0080><U+0099>s son.Speculation: Stannis lectures Davos about the divine nature of his mission, but eventually releases him from captivity (and restores him as Hand?) Melisandre brings Gendry to Dragonstone and tells Stannis why he<U+0080><U+0099>s important. I<U+0080><U+0099>m having a hard time seeing where Melisandre<U+0080><U+0099>s seduction of Gendry fits in now, but maybe they sleep together and then Gendry wakes up tied to the bed so that Melisandre can do her work? Davos demanding <U+0080>proof<U+0080><U+0099> from Melisandre sounds like it will be used as a way to introduce the leeches.If the episode ends with Stannis reciting the three names, I have to wonder if they<U+0080><U+0099>ll cut over to Pyke and show Balon Greyjoy actually falling off a bridge (and the Faceless Man who knocks him off). On the one hand, it would remind viewers that Balon exists and still considers himself a king, as he<U+0080><U+0099>s out of sight and out of mind all season. On the other hand, showing his death onscreen in the episode before the Red Wedding could make Robb<U+0080><U+0099>s impending death too obvious, since we<U+0080><U+0099>ve seen plenty of examples of the Lord of Light<U+0080><U+0099>s power. If Balon dies almost immediately after the leeches are thrown in the fire, even casual viewers are going to be on the highest possible alert.Arya and the HoundSynopsis: NothingPromo: The Hound and a captive Arya ride towards the Twins. Arya stands over the sleeping Clegane, preparing to smash his head in with a rock.Recap Video: Arya runs away from the Brotherhood, and is captured by the Hound.Speculation:  The Hound tells Arya that he<U+0080><U+0099>s taking her to her mother and brother at the Twins to ransom her. Arya reminds the Hound how much she hates his guts. She tries to kill him while he sleeps, but he wakes up and stops her. I expect most of the pre-RW events that happen while these two characters are together will be shifted back into Season 4 to give them more to do.TheonSynopsis: NothingPromo: NothingRecap Video: NothingSpeculation: No Theon this week, and thank God. We could all use a break after what happened in the last episode. I strongly suspect that Theon won<U+0080><U+0099>t appear again until the finale, after the Boltons have betrayed the Starks and Ramsay safely unveil his true identity.Sam and GillySynopsis: <U+0080><U+009C>Sam and Gilly meet an older gentleman<U+0080><U+009D>.Promo: A White Walker hunts Sam and Gilly through the forest. Gilly pleads with Sam not to go outside. Sam stands his ground as the White Walker approaches.Recap Video: Sam shows Gilly the obsidian dagger.Speculation: Sam the Slayer, Puddles the Other, and Coldhands. They<U+0080><U+0099>ll likely combine these scenes and have Coldhands show up right after Sam earns his nickname. If they want to raise the stakes even more, Rast and a few Night<U+0080><U+0099>s Watchmen may turn up as wights, but I think that there<U+0080><U+0099>s more than enough material to cover without them.Bran and the ReedsSynopsis: Nothing.Promo: Nothing.Recap Video: Nothing.Speculation:  Bran and the Reeds won<U+0080><U+0099>t appear again until Queenscrown in Episode 9.Top post, can see pretty much all this happening.  Appropriate use of 'absolutely smashed' btw.How do we know the Other is called Puddles?
5769	Arkash	2013-05-16	Like I said above, I'm quite sure we will have the will... and it will be carried by the Blackfish (who will then not go to the wedding) who will later be blocked at Riverrun, besieged by Lannister armies... this way, the Blackfish becomes more important (being a combination of Maege Mormont and Galbart Glover) and we will see his whereabouts and the will whereabouts.
5770	Tone	2013-05-16	Bad Idea, imo... it would suggest that it is really Melissandre who killed him... whereas I always saw it in the book as just... well, she sees they will die but takes no part in it... and doing it the way you suggest would really make like she has a real hand in it.Interesting take. I always thought it added to her mystery... after the leech scene it def gave me chills when learning about Balon's death and immediately I was worried for Robb. The RW was still a huge shock.I like your take on it, when I read it I never took it as these 3 died because of Melisandre, but part of me wondered if they would still be alive if she hadn't burned those 3 leeches.
5771	Colonel Green	2013-05-16	I think Robb will name Jon his heir but will specify that he is the heir after any children he might have with Talisa... thus avoiding Winterfell passing on to Sansa and Tyrion later on (this means Robb will hear of the wedding at KL... but in episode 8 or 9 ?)... and then will send the Blackfish with it, to the North.At this point I think the heir thing isn't happening.  They've done everything this season to foreclose the need for him to do that, between having him believe his brothers are still alive to actually having a child on the way.
5772	Where Boars Glow	2013-05-16	I was thinking it'd be a mass wight attack, he'd take down one, realize they're screwed still, and then Coldhands gets the rest.I was thinking that maybe they'd just have Robb legitimize Jon instead of naming him heir. If he's legitimized, he doesn't need to be named heir because then he automatically comes after Robb's children. Plus it sets up Ramsay's legitimizing. And it fits in with Catelyn's speech about being unable to keep her promise to love Jon as one of her own. So it gives her a reason to argue.I have been thinking back on the TV show change of Cat expressing her remorse over how she treated Jon Snow and how this may be the reason the Gods are punishing her. Because she could never find the strength to do right by him. Maybe this episode will feature a Cat redemption of her talking Rob into legitamizing Jon Snow since Rob now has an heir and she figures it won't matter?
5773	Northbound	2013-05-16	I actually think Cat will be the one to talk Robb in to making the will and naming Jon heir. I don't think she trusts Talisa.  Did you notice the look on Cat's face, when she walked out the tent; when Robb was holding and kissing Talisa?  The look said to me "I don't like this bitch and she up to something!"
5774	The Unholy Reaver	2013-05-16	I just want a certain younger brother to return.
5775	mwizzle83	2013-05-16	From what I've heard, Episode 9 will only cover Robb' storyline. So we should get a good sense of who accompanies him to the RW and therefore who will DIE.
5776	protar	2013-05-16	From what I've heard, Episode 9 will only cover Robb' storyline. So we should get a good sense of who accompanies him to the RW and therefore who will DIE.I fear you've heard wrongly. The episode preview texts clearly state that Jon, Bran, Dany and (I think) KL at least will all be featured.EDIT: In the preview trailer for E8 at 20 seconds there's a shot of some guy i don't know (possibly Daario?) with a scantily clad woman sitting on his lap. Do we have any idea what this is? Just more gratuitous nudity I guess.

5777	The Mighty Conch	2013-05-16	I fear you've heard wrongly. The episode preview texts clearly state that Jon, Bran, Dany and (I think) KL at least will all be featured.I agree. There is no way GoT show will break form and just spend one hour on Robb for the RW. Not only would that take away from the other storylines, but it would be a dead giveaway for the RW. At least I would think so.
5778	Tone	2013-05-16	I thought the same thing the first time I heard that rumor. If they spent the whole episode @ the Twins people would be like "Okay something big is about to happen"
5779	The Mighty Conch	2013-05-16	I just want a certain younger brother to return.Seeing Rickon would be nice. I bet you people who haven't read the books just assume he's dead, doesn't know who he is, or is just not important. And every time they mention his name they probably are like "who is Rickon....?" Since he has BARELY been in the show. I wouldn't remember him that well at least.

But I think there would be too much going on if he showed up. He can easily show up in 9 or 10. Not saying I dont want to see him...
5788	Khal-a-bunga	2013-05-16	Something tells me that Robb and Bran may both make short appearances in this episode. As SoManyVows stated in his (excellent) speculation, the scene from the trailer where Robb and Catelyn discuss taking Casterly Rock seems like it would naturally fall into place directly prior to the Red Wedding. With Bran, and I may be wrong, but shouldn't Osha and Rickon have left the rest of the group before Queenscrown? Either way, I think they may both get short scenes in the next episode.
5789	Dysun	2013-05-16	I would like to see the leeches early in the episode, and if we can't get a Patrick Malahide cameo at least show Asha (yara) receiving the news of his death and the foreboding arrival of Euron's Silence in the background. (ala Mance & Wildlings camp in S2E10).This doesn't have to happen here though, could happen in the finale
5790	Daemul	2013-05-16	Urgh, Daario. eyiqsusdjsjoshdupdbfudiuikjdhsyaiukdbkdififuf.
I was hoping against hope that he would be written out of the series, but oh well, you can't have it all. I'll just have to mute every scene which involves him, just like I'll do when Darkstar shows up.
5791	King in the North Carolina	2013-05-16	How do we know the Other is called Puddles?It's certainly about as non-canonical as anything can possibly be. He was named Puddles in a thread on these boards a while back.

5792	The Fourth Head	2013-05-16	With Bran, and I may be wrong, but shouldn't Osha and Rickon have left the rest of the group before Queenscrown? Either way, I think they may both get short scenes in the next episode.Why can't Rickon and Osha be there at Queenstown? the way they are playing it, I'm guessing they will separate like so...They arrive at the wall together, but still in disagreement about whether to travel along to Castle Black or to go beyond it to see the 3 eyed crow.When they meet Sam, he tells them Jon was north of the wall last time he saw him and that he is probably dead now. This validates Jojen's vision to Osha and Bran, and therefore, validates the three-eyed crow story to Bran too. Defeated, Osha realises that Bran wont be persuaded to go to Castle Black any more, yet, after hearing Sam's story, she is even more scared than she was before. She refuses to go beyond the wall and complains that Rickon is too young to be taken on such a perilous path simply because Bran wants him around- it being far more dangerous north of the wall than it is south. She proposes to find a safe place to hide Rickon south of the wall instead. As she "knows" what it's like, and as Sam has just come back that way and barely escaped with his life, It will really add to the scary sense of foreboding as Bran "descends" the stairs with Hodor, Jojen and Meera, whilst Sam, Gilly Osha and Rickon remain looking on, fearfully.The later Rickon and Osha separate from the others, the better. This is because:a ) a large gap spanning years in real time will cause casual fans to forget him entirely.b ) the writers will have a hard time inventing story for them when they don't know what GRRM has in mind for them both.c ) inventing a separate story for them will add yet another strand to a highly fragmented series. Rotating cast storylines would be a nightmare.

We don't get any screen time with him, so no one will notice if they recast him later. On the other hand, I wouldn't be surprised if the show insists on keeping Osha, which means keeping Rickon. But I don't really see any reason to make stuff up just to keep them. Their story basically concludes with Rickon fleeing to Skaagos.
5798	oierem	2013-05-16	It seems that both episodes 8 and 9 are going to contain less storylines, which seems appropriate (who said that they had learned from their "mistakes" from season 2 and there would be less storylines per episode this season?)
-Episode 8 is going to be quite heavy on KL (this is supposed to be the climax of the arc), Dragonstone (about time), Dany and Sam, and Arya will appear as well. I don't think anyone else will appear, since there isn't any logical reason for that. Robb could appear but it might work better if they focus on him more in episode 9.
-Episode 9 will only feature three storylines: Robb/Arya, Jon/Bran, and Dany, which is appropriate. I don't think KL will or should appear in this episode. Essentially, every storyline should get the spotlight in either in episode 8 or 9.
One question though: has the Eerye been cut? If so, it seems that they've cut more scenes than ever this season, perhaps justifying why they originally said that the episodes were going to be longer this season (which is clearly not true).

Depending on how long these last three episodes are (and I believe that we already have confirmation that the finale will, once again, exceed an hour in length), this season could possibly contain the approximate length of an additional episode compared to the second season. I believe the original quote concerns the length of this season relative to season two (or 'last season', as I seem to remember it said in the statement, though I could be wrong).
5800	Don Roberto	2013-05-16	I actually think Cat will be the one to talk Robb in to making the will and naming Jon heir. I don't think she trusts Talisa.  Did you notice the look on Cat's face, when she walked out the tent; when Robb was holding and kissing Talisa?  The look said to me "I don't like this bitch and she up to something!"If I remember correctly, she wasn't fond of Jeyne Westerling either.
5801	go joff go	2013-05-16	If I remember correctly, she wasn't fond of Jeyne Westerling either.Man the internet will explode if Cat suggests Jon be in Robbs will.  But I would love it.  I don't really care what the insufferable book cat would do I think it would be cool if her last act was a noble one,  Plus its something that really make the RW seem that must more sad.  Of course we would get the same incessent whining about blah blah book cat this book cat that.

Why else show that "dragon glass" at all?You just answered your own question. They won't.Remember that the Slayer scene was originally moved out of E7 and replaced by the Bear Pit scene.  And Coldhands was always set to appear in E8. So we'll essentially be getting 2 episodes worth of Sam's story this week.

I also agree with the earlier poster(s) who said that showrunners shouldn't try so hard to put EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER into the last episode of the season. If you can wait until episode two or three before returning to a character's story (which they have), then you can also end another character's story in episode eight. As long as there's some semblance of resolution, no one's going to mind.

Give them a scene that lifts the hopes of the audience(perhaps Balon's death?) only to crush them in the next episode. But not having a decent-length scene between the two is just madness. Especially in regards to Cat, considering how she's been relegated to the background for the second half of the season.

Especially in regards to Cat, considering how she's been relegated to the background for the second half of the season.IMO is too late for that. If they had to show something to lift the hopes of the audience they should have done it many episodes earlier.They should have created a fake future plot about Robb's war, adding more details about how is he going to march against Casterly Rock. Have Robb and Blackfish chating about how they are going to make siege machines when they get there. Or have Tyrion repeat again that the Kingdom's in debt to Braavosi Iron Bank and the only way to pay them is a new loan from Tywin and Casterly Rock forcing to the viewer's mind the idea that if CR falls, Robb has indeed a chance to win. Also, they should have had the Freys ask for more things from Robb to make more believable or at least less suspicious their agreement. Along with Edmure's wedding, have them asking from Robb to agree to marry his future heir with a Frey girl.There were so many things they could have done but now it's too late. Most of my non-readers friend are sure that Robb is going to die, unfortunately.

5826	Lord Elrosir	2013-05-17	TK, I agree wholeheartedly.
5827	King Tommen	2013-05-17	Unless the scene has been cut, the trailers for S3 have Robb and Cat looking at his war map with Robb saying "Take their gold, take their land...." as well as Cat saying "Show them what it means to have something taken from them...".
I have to think that if the scene remains, it will be in this episode.  It probably won't be very long which could be why there's no shot of Robb in the episode previews.  Or possibly, it could be at the very start of E9 before they get to the Twins.
I don't see how having a scene with Robb naming Jon his heir does anything other than put a big neon light pointing at Robb saying "About to die...".  I honestly don't think that this development has anywhere near the importance that some fans think it does.  I mean, seeing as Jon just got stabbed to death and is going to warg into Ghost or whatever the hell is happening with him, I think his path is not going to be taking him to Lord of Winterfell anytime soon.  And even in the case where that story point comes into play down the road, there are plenty of ways to write around it.  Even in the books, you had Stannis offering Winterfell to Jon and legitimizing him as the King.  So I really don't get the obsessiveness about it.
I'm more interested to see what the hell they have in store for Talisa, especially since she's announced she's pregnant.  I want to see if the Blackfish is coming to the RW.  If that's the case, then I'm going to put my money on Robb ordering the Blackfish to save her and his unborn son in the middle of the chaos and them getting away back to Riverrun, thus resetting us back to book narrative (albeit with audience knowledge that Jeyne/Talisa is pregnant).
If Blackfish isn't at the RW, I could certainly see them upping the drama by having her die with Robb's unborn child just to really drive home the misery.  I think the first option is better though.
5828	YuvalTheVal	2013-05-17	I have to agree they kinda messed up the entire Robb/Cat storyline... The RW would be so much more powerful if they would actually make it seem like Robb could win the war.
5829	protar	2013-05-17	Couldn't the older gentleman also be the old man the wildlings kill when Bran is warging Summer to help Jon Snow?As it refers to Sam's storyline almost certainly not. It can be no one other than CH's unless D+D are not only deviating from the books, but trolling us about it as well.Episode 8, as I've said, will feature : KL, Arya, Sam, Dany and Dragonstone. Episode 9, I'm sure will be : Robb, Jon, Bran, Arya, Dragonstone, Theon, Dany... I really hope they cut KL out of that one ! Episode 10 will have quite everybody... I dont think we will see Jaime until last episode now...I can see that, but I don't think we'll be seeing Theon again until the finale. He's confirmed for just 6 episodes. Hopefully episode 10 won't be too crowded. If they give Jaime a scene in episode 9 he doesn't have to appear, and neither will Robb and Cat obviously. Dragonstone can also be cut from the finale imo unless the preview proves otherwise.
5830	JonDunn	2013-05-17	There are many people I know that think Robb is going to die at some point, but I know many people who think he is due for a strategic victory too.  The audience is large and VERY varied.
5831	King Tommen	2013-05-17	As it refers to Sam's storyline almost certainly not.

Dragonstone can also be cut from the finale imo unless the preview proves otherwise.I tend to think that Theon will be in E9 and not in the finale.  Only because the reveal of who Ramsay is and that Theon's at the Dreadfort would make more sense to occur right before Roose betrays Robb.  Having the reveal be an episode later would be kind of counter-productive.
5832	FlightEcho	2013-05-17	I hope we see Sam killing an Other this episode. I would have preferred it if all of the brothers of the Nights Watch had seen it though.
5833	King Tommen	2013-05-17	I hope we see Sam killing an Other this episode. I would have preferred it if all of the brothers of the Nights Watch had seen it though.Even in the books, the only NW person who see's Sam do it is Grenn. It's not that big of a deal.  Gilly's going to see him do it which makes a whole lot more sense in how it develops their relationship and the way she thinks of him.
5834	protar	2013-05-17	I tend to think that Theon will be in E9 and not in the finale.  Only because the reveal of who Ramsay is and that Theon's at the Dreadfort would make more sense to occur right before Roose betrays Robb.  Having the reveal be an episode later would be kind of counter-productive.That will sort of be a bit of a give away that Roose is about to betray Robb though. I think that the reveal will be much better after the RW, with Ramsay taunting Theon about it, causing him to screw up his last vestiges of courage and try to escape.
5835	King Tommen	2013-05-17	That will sort of be a bit of a give away that Roose is about to betray Robb though. I think that the reveal will be much better after the RW, with Ramsay taunting Theon about it, causing him to screw up his last vestiges of courage and try to escape.My thought is that they'll have the reveal be almost concurrent with the events of the RW.  You have the ceremony, going into the reception, Catelyn notices that Roose has left, and then cut to the Dreadfort where finally Ramsay says what happened at Winterfell and how his father was complicit.  Then you cut back to the RW just as the shit starts to go down and Roose comes back in and takes out Robb.I don't think they'd be holding back on the reveal of Ramsay this long unless they were planning to make it link up with Roose's betrayal.  Having it happen an episode after we already have seen what a villain Roose is deflates that entire scene.  The audience would be like "Duh, well of course that's what happened, we saw last episode that your father is a betrayer.  No surprise there."
5836	Rabid Grunt	2013-05-17	The RW would be so much more powerful if they would actually make it seem like Robb could win the war.But then there would be no obvious reason for Bolton/Kartark to betray him.
5837	King Tommen	2013-05-17	But then there would be no obvious reason for Bolton/Kartark to betray him.People seem to forget in the books that Robb was in the process of slinking back with his tail between his legs to the North to try and retake it from the Ironborn when he got to the RW.  All of ASoS is about him being in a death spiral and losing the strategic war and the hearts of his men.  The only positive thing that happens in the books is right before the RW, where he finally acknowledges that his campaign in the Riverlands is doomed so he regroups to head back North.  In the show, they've replaced this action with him deciding to take Casterly Rock which he establishes is an achievable goal as long as he has the Frey's onside.
5838	Prince of the North	2013-05-17	Why do people think Coldhands is Benjen? It was stated Coldhands "died a long time ago". Benjen hasn't been dead long at all if he is even dead. I never believed Coldhands to be Benjen in the slightest but I am curious to what everyone thinks about this topic? If you think Coldhands is Benjen, tell me why! If you think Benjen is alive, what the hell has he been doing and when will he re-appear.Spot on Exar0s. Unless GRR is doing his 'gardening' writing method to the max (AKA writing as you go), Benjen CAN NOT be coldhands.The "long ago" statement by Leaf is not nearly the "smoking gun" people make it out to be.  The idea that because Leaf is long-lived that she absolutely must have meant something longer than a couple of years ago or whatever is just as big of an assumption as anything else.  In any case, I can't wait to see Coldhands on HBO!
5839	redriver	2013-05-17	I hope we see Sam killing an Other this episode. I would have preferred it if all of the brothers of the Nights Watch had seen it though.It's pretty clear in the trailers I've seen that Sam is being approached by a WW.He's shouting "stay back,stay back".So I'm sure we'll see Puddles in this episode and Coldhands.Probably not any other NW though.
5840	House Ross	2013-05-17	I've been expecting an Other as the old man. They look old af to me. Been looking forward to this point in Sams tv story since I read it. 
The wedding/ feast should also be most excellent. Dinklage is going to own these scenes.

For example, Sam and Gilly are confronted by an Other, Sam whips out "Chekov's obsidian dagger" and kills the Other who will forever after be known as "Puddles" with it, then a large group of shambling wights emerges and Sam and Gilly look to be goners, but then Coldhands shows up and saves their bacon.

5846	AzorAhai42	2013-05-17	Great Daario will make his appearance in the series(take out gun, shoots myself in the head).  Thank the Gods, we can't hear Dany's thoughts; like in the book. I'm sure the writers will give us ample amounts of visual clues. :roll:
5847	Dove	2013-05-17	I know it's in vogue to hate Daario 'round these parts (just by his description in the books alone how do you not crack up) but he looks seriously improved in the show. Look at that smug-ass grin on his face in the previews and tell me it's not great, and there's nary a blue hair, golden mustachio, or yellow suede suit to be seen.
IDK, guys, I think I might... end up liking Daario.
5848	King in the North Carolina	2013-05-17	My thought is that they'll have the reveal be almost concurrent with the events of the RW.  You have the ceremony, going into the reception, Catelyn notices that Roose has left, and then cut to the Dreadfort where finally Ramsay says what happened at Winterfell and how his father was complicit.  Then you cut back to the RW just as the shit starts to go down and Roose comes back in and takes out Robb.I hope they do it in this fashion. The Bolton reveals should occur in the same episode and nearly simultaneously, IMO.

He takes bribes, he gives terrible advice (his advice was to slaughter the Yunkai nobility at a wedding) , and he's incredibly obnoxious.
5850	Khal-a-bunga	2013-05-17	I hope they do it in this fashion. The Bolton reveals should occur in the same episode and nearly simultaneously, IMO.My only issue with the reveal playing out like this is that it doesn't allow Theon to find out that Robb and Catelyn have been murdered, which I think would work well to close out that story line for the season and ties it in to the other plot thread (tangentially, at least). Also, just remember that scene with Theon describing how he could never match up with Robb, just by the simple virtue of Robb 'being who he [is]', and I can definitely see that being brought up again. It'll be Theon's chance to ruminate on the Red Wedding, like nearly every other character will be doing in the finale, and it will give the audience a full two episodes before seeing Theon again, which I think is best for the pacing of the season (or will be, at least, during a re-watch). More than anything, though, I don't think they should cut away from switching between Arya and the Hound outside of the Twins, and Robb, Catelyn and the rest inside at the wedding once they've committed to starting the slaughter.
5851	Don Roberto	2013-05-17	People seem to forget in the books that Robb was in the process of slinking back with his tail between his legs to the North to try and retake it from the Ironborn when he got to the RW.  All of ASoS is about him being in a death spiral and losing the strategic war and the hearts of his men.  The only positive thing that happens in the books is right before the RW, where he finally acknowledges that his campaign in the Riverlands is doomed so he regroups to head back North.  In the show, they've replaced this action with him deciding to take Casterly Rock which he establishes is an achievable goal as long as he has the Frey's onside.Agreed.On the other hand, in the books he was on his way back to take Moat Cailin when he crosses the Twins. It was just there, in his path, some other boring task he had to do before resuming his war. There was much talk about strategy, how he'd redeploy his troops, even leaving Cat at Seagard, etc., that I think no one really though much of the Frey wedding at all.Now they're going back to the Twins to win the Frey's army, in a campaign to take Casterly Rock all the way at the West. Edmure's wedding feels much more important and more urgent, especially since it's during the end of the season, that even those that can not envision the scale of shit that will be the Red Wedding, know that things will not go smoothly.They should have made this all about Moat Cailin and retaking the North, so that the viewers would actually expect the grand finale of the season to be the battle against the ironborns, only to be gutted by Robb's death. They could even draw a parallele with the attack of the wildlings at the Wall, giving it a sense that Robb would deal with the ironborns now, but have to deal with Mance next season... anyway, there's plenty they could have done, but now the surprise is half-ruined.

In my group of Unsullied the hatred towards the Lannisters is far greater than anything towards the Ironborn.  They're generally happy at the thought of Tywin's house being taken.
5853	Breaking Bronn	2013-05-17	http://www.seat42f.c...ons-photos.htmlhttp://www.imdb.com/.../flat/214577790Looks like Tyrion will be married in the Great Sept of Baelor, which looked to be the case since that scene in the second trailer of Joff walking with Sansa.Also looks like we'll get the Dany nude scene alluded to in Clarke's appearance on Jimmy Kimmel's show. So she wasn't just blowing steam in the hopes of attracting more viewers. This should quell the rumors of Clarke's alleged anti-nudity clause.By the way, called it!

5863	victim	2013-05-17	Agreed.On the other hand, in the books he was on his way back to take Moat Cailin when he crosses the Twins.

It had doom spelt all over it from the very beginning, from Cat's discomforting warnings to Grey Wind's anxiety and ferocity and the huge amount of emphasis being placed upon just how important guest right is. It hardly felt like just a wedding. It was spread over multiple chapters so I immediately thought it was curious and certainly more than "some other boring task." The actual shocking part of the RW is the How and the What, rather than the When and the Why. You just don't see what's coming come until it actually happens. Reading through the Unsullied thread at the TWoP forums, most people seem to think Robb is going to die (but then again, a lot think Tywin will die too), yet they don't see the slaughter coming at all, they don't think it will happen as it does, they don't think Cat is going to die and so on. The doom is spelled because it is supposed to be. Would you rather a say "oh, wow, so Robb and Cat are dead? I didn't see that coming" or "I can't believe they killed them like that! How horrible."
5864	go joff go	2013-05-17	Yeah people are being pretty disingenous about the book RW in order to bash the show which has been by no means perfect.  But Robb's death was pretty much a foregone conclusion in the books although Cats  was a surprise.  Like the above post says it was definitely the way it happened that was shocking.  I will be interested to see if it can be replicated simply b/c the transition from a POV telling versus a third preson viewing might lose some of the impact.
5865	protar	2013-05-18	My thought is that they'll have the reveal be almost concurrent with the events of the RW.  You have the ceremony, going into the reception, Catelyn notices that Roose has left, and then cut to the Dreadfort where finally Ramsay says what happened at Winterfell and how his father was complicit.  Then you cut back to the RW just as the shit starts to go down and Roose comes back in and takes out Robb.I don't think they'd be holding back on the reveal of Ramsay this long unless they were planning to make it link up with Roose's betrayal.  Having it happen an episode after we already have seen what a villain Roose is deflates that entire scene.  The audience would be like "Duh, well of course that's what happened, we saw last episode that your father is a betrayer.  No surprise there."You do make a good point, so yeah I guess E9 would be a good place to have it. And fortunately we're going to finally get some plot development with Theon.EDIT: But then I wanted some RW taunting as well. Maybe next season I guess.

5866	Mordos_Kull	2013-05-18	Are there anymore obvious hints in Theon's arc about how he is tortured? They did the finger flaying and the "castration", I would assume whatever else they do with him will be relevant to what he is put through, depending on whether they chose to reveal Ramsey or not.

5867	go joff go	2013-05-18	I've seen people mention it but I think the Ramsey reveal could be when/if Roose gives Cat a piece of Theon as a wedding present.  There is a scene in the beginning of season previews where we see Cat smacking someone and I have seen people speculate that its a Frey, but I think it could be Roose. maybe after giving the gift. 
One thing that I secretly hope they do is to give Roose a Theon moment.  That is a moment where he gives the Starks a chance to win him over, before deciding he is going to go through with it, since we  know from ADWD that he wasn't as all in on the betrayal as everyone initially assumed.  Maybe Cat smacking him could serve as that moment.
5868	victim	2013-05-18	Are there anymore obvious hints in Theon's arc about how he is tortured?

5869	silentwanderer	2013-05-18	Another reason for it to be called second sons is because Tyrion is one.The Hound is a second son too and, strictly speaking, Arya is a second daughter. I don't quite remember if Theon was a second son on the show, but I feel Sam is treated as a second son by his father when he disowns him.

I don't quite remember if Theon was a second son on the show, but I feel Sam is treated as a second son by his father when he disowns him.According to the appendices at the end, Theon is the baby. His two brothers and Asha are older (Asha is second youngest)But if you want show specific details, Yara tells a story about when he was in a crib and he looked up and smiled. So she's still older than him. And Balon says to Theon "your brothers were warriors" which means they were also older than him.

5871	LilJonUmber	2013-05-18	I think that the reveal will be much better after the RW, with Ramsay taunting Theon about it, causing him to screw up his last vestiges of courage and try to escape.Hey all. Just signed up and wanted to join in on the fun. I tend to agree that "Boy's" reveal would be best handled in the final episode -- after the RW and Balon's ... accident.I can totally see him taking great pleasure in reminding Theon that he's officially lost everything, and even making him feel responsible for Robb's demise through his betrayal. Thus Theon's transformation into Reek' becomes complete, as he's lost both families and has nowhere else to turn to.  Who knows? They may even have Ramsay lie to Theon and say his sister's dead too.Excited to see how they handled it.
					
					
							Edited by LilJonUmber, 18 May 2013 - 10:33 AM.
5872	Arkash	2013-05-18	I agree, I think the reveal will be for episode 10...
I can really see Tywin discussing with Cersei about rewardind Roose Bolton and saying they will give Arya Stark to Roose's basard son and asking Joffrey to legitimize him... this way people will wonder how the fuck they plan to give Arya while they do not have her, and people being scared of Arya meeting Ramsay...
5873	LilJonUmber	2013-05-18	I like where you're going with that. It'd definitely give the Hound and Arya plenty to do next season, if they were on the run from both the North and the Lannisters.  It'd also better set up the eventual encounter with Polliver and the Tickler, and for Arya's decision to flee to Braavos (presumably happening in S4x10).
5874	WiDMNDBAMMD	2013-05-18	-Dany meets the captain of the Second Sons, Mero, the Titan's BastardI assume these are Yunkai's powerful friends. I think rather than have different sellsword companies, they will have only one, with Daario being a captain. I think that, in episode 10 (in the battle?), or at the end of this episode, Daario will kill Mero and become captain. This would seem more likely as there is no point in returning when all he did was, unintentionally, help reveal Barristan's identity. When will the dragons be named!?I think you're right about Daario killing the other leaders of the Storm Crows so that they can join Dany.-The wedding of Tyrion and SansaAh, how I have awaited this. Unfortunately, it will not be as I hoped it would. After all, Moon Boy isn't in the show, and Dontos seems to have disappeared. Since Garlan (and Willas) are nonexistent, it is likely that Loras will dance with Sansa, if he hasn't already stormed out of the hall. I wonder if Tommen will return ... Tyrion likely drove that knife into the table while shouting at Joffrey, which will give him more reason to kill him. I have no idea how Cersei will come up with her line.When they play "Rain's of Castamere" at Tyrion and Sansa's wedding Cersei will explain what the song is about to Margaery(? Shouldn't she already know? Whatever though, she'll probably play dumb for dramatic reasons) who is right behind her when she says "every man woman and child is put to the sword". Two things this does, one it again shows the conflict between Marg and Cersei and gives Cersei a chance to point out her families power and what they do to traitors who betray them, since she doesn't trust the Tyrell's. The second is it tells the unsullied the story behind "the Lannister song"-The Dragonstone gangI think now that Gendry has arrived, they will do the leech thing. Stannis will copy Arya and come up with his own hit list. I am eagerly awaiting Balon's fall and Yara/Asha's reappearance (9 or 10). But they might do something else with Gendry ... Shadow-baby? Balon will die one way or another, we know. Afterwards, Stannis will give his "duty" speech to Davos, while revealing Gendry's presence and purpose in the castle. Will we see Davos' lessons with Shireen? And the long-awaited Davos/Mel chat.I don't think we'll get the names. I think Mel will just use the blood and throw it into a fire saying "false king fall before the true king" or some other crap like that.-The She-Wolf and the DogSandor and Arya begin their journey to Riverrun/the Twins. She will try to kill him. I can't remember what stopped her in the books ...With the rock the Hound wakes up(or wasn't sleeping at all) and takes it from her, she kicks him and he says "I'll give you that one, but if you try it again...." something about tying her up etc.-Samwell Tarly. Other SlayerGilly and Sam wind up in a deserted wildling village. They hear a noise at night. Gilly says "Don't go out there" but Sam does anyway. Either Sam successfully kills the Other, and Coldhands shows up at a different point, or Sam tries to kill it and Coldhands saves him, but allows Sam to be known as the one that killed it. The first one is more likely, but I am very confident of Coldhands and Slayer happening. But since Sam showed Gilly the dagger in the recap, I doubt Coldhands will save them.Coldhands will save them, but not from the white walker. I'm guess that more wights and walkers show up after Sam slays "Puddles"I don't see many problems with Robb's will. He could still write his will before the wedding (though this could give too much away about the events during the Red Wedding, since in the books Robb writes his will in fear he could die while assaulting Moat Cailin), and if in the future his heir turns out to be Jon (and if that's of any importance to the story), it could just say so when it's finally revealed. We'd miss Robb and Catelyn's exchange over Jon, but with so much else missing, that doesn't really seem important at all.All the reasons he legitimizes Jon are gone from the show or haven't happened yet. Sansa's wedding might be enough to prompt Robb to legitimize Jon though and/or hearing about Balon's death. This idea is sounding more and more reasonable to me. Please someone convince me that I must be wrong, PLEASE!I'll try to convince you I guess. They showed the scene with Talisa and Catelyn about Catelyn already telling Ned to "call him Stark" and be done with it.Robb will find out about Sansa's wedding to Tyrion and the Lannister's trying to claim the North in next episode(or the ninth) I suppose which will prompt him into legitimizing Jon.If Jon is a legitimate Stark he is now his heir over Sansa Stark, but not over his own son/daughter from Talisa. Catelyn will probably be upset about losing Sansa/Arya to the Lannisters and give her "show them how it feels to lose what they love"I'm quite sure the Blackfish wont die... now, will he be sent with the will before entering the Twins, will he escape the massacre with Talisa or alone, or will he be taken captive, I dont know !The Blackfish better not die.I really wish for the first option and really fear the second one ! I think it would diminish the impact if someone managed to escape the RW...Like Arya and the Hound? Like Greatjon and the other "prisoners" that the Freys have from the RW?More than anything, though, I don't think they should cut away from switching between Arya and the Hound outside of the Twins, and Robb, Catelyn and the rest inside at the wedding once they've committed to starting the slaughter.It won't happen like that.
	Spoiler  I saw in a promo a brief shot of Arya with the Hound in what looked like a dungeon. Arya runs forward looking scared/worried and the Hound grabs her by the shoulder and pulls her back. Basically the whole shot is one second but that one second is enough to figure out some things.I believe that Arya is going to get close enough to see the carnage unfold and the Hound will have to retrain her from trying to "save her mother" and getting slaughtered herself.

5885	A Man Has Said	2013-05-18	I don't know why everyone assumes that the older gent that Bran meets is going to be Cold Hands. It seems to me way too early in the story for that, even taking into consideration how far the TV series is from the books. Cold Hands meets Sam and Gilly first, and they have to pass under the wall to give Bran's party a way through.I think that the older gent must therefore be the Liddle they meet in the mountains just south of the wall.("Storm of Swords" Chapter 24)

5888	bobbybuilderton	2013-05-18	I don't know why everyone assumes that the older gent that Bran meets is going to be Cold Hands.

Cold Hands meets Sam and Gilly first, and they have to pass under the wall to give Bran's party a way through.I think that the older gent must therefore be the Liddle they meet in the mountains just south of the wall.("Storm of Swords" Chapter 24)I think you misread. The synopsis says Sam and Gilly meet an older gentleman, and that is why we have been saying Coldhands...I don't think most people have said anything about Bran....Unless I am remembering wrong (not about to check 17 pages.)

I did indeed misread. Thanks for the polite correction.
5892	TheGriffonReborn	2013-05-18	The synopsis says "older man", which would imply Coldhands, but in the preiview it looks like Sam The Slayer. Idk, maybe they'll have the Other come with a bunch of wights, Sam will kill the Other, only to be overwhelmed by the wights, then Coldhands arrives to save the day.
5893	King Tommen	2013-05-18	You do make a good point, so yeah I guess E9 would be a good place to have it. And fortunately we're going to finally get some plot development with Theon.EDIT: But then I wanted some RW taunting as well. Maybe next season I guess.The taunting would be nice but who's to say that can't be done in E1 of next season? We do have pretty much another full year of Theon at the Dreadfort coming so they'll need to fill it out somehow.I also think that they should try and wrap up a couple storylines prior to the finale and Theon's should be done once the Ramsey reveal is made. I don't want them to be checking in on 10 different spots that episode.
5894	King Tommen	2013-05-18	My bad. I did indeed misread. Thanks for the polite correction.It's funny but there have been numerous posters who have made the same mistake. I think it must be because people automatically associate Coldhands with Bran as opposed to Sam who meets him first.

Which system of government was really better?I think it's that stuff gets leaked and vkontakte (Russian version of Facebook) is just the first place they get posted on.  Cos there are no real copyright laws so no risk of prosecution.  That said, if the Russians do get them first, count me in on this GULag scheme!

5900	BendTheKnee610	2013-05-18	Based on the TV spot that shows Sam running into Bran's group, he'll probably encounter both the White Walker and Coldhands in this episode; I don't see the latter occurring in episode 9.
5901	The Scabbard Of the Morning	2013-05-18	Sam is not running into Bran's group, one is south and one is north of the wall, and we haven't had Queenscrown yet.
Also, after the cloak scene there will be much Sansa hate that flows again. She can't get a break.

5902	bobbybuilderton	2013-05-18	Sam is not running into Bran's group, one is south and one is north of the wall, and we haven't had Queenscrown yet.Also, after the cloak scene there will be much Sansa hate that flows again. She can't get a break.I thought as much also. Hoping they'll do it so that she's so busy crying she doesn't notice he's trying to get her attention. If they have her standing there just refusing to kneel a bit, she will be hated foreverandever for denying our white knight Tyrion the embarrassment.
5903	Colonel Green	2013-05-18	From all appearances the cloak bit is going to be Sansa's lone opportunity for defiance this season, so I'd rather they play that like in the books and then defend her from sexist idiots afterward, then remove her main moment of strength in that story.

As far as adaptation goes, if I was in charge I'd have this be her low point in terms of control over her own life and the dreams she's had for years. It would fit with the trend this season people losing what defines them and being rebuilt because of it.With the final death of her dream, she is in a position to be transformed. That would be my reasoning for having her just not noticing, though I can see why someone would choose to do it differently.
5905	King Tommen	2013-05-18	Sam is not running into Bran's group, one is south and one is north of the wall, and we haven't had Queenscrown yet.I think the post was referring to Sam running into Bran at some point this season (presumably the finale) because the S3 trailers show this taking place.  And if you aren't going to show Sam in E9 (because they aren't going to be covering off that many storylines in such an important episode) then that means the Coldhands meeting with Sam needs to take place in E8. Of course, the synopsis this week confirms this is happening anyways so none of this should come as a surprise.
5906	The Scabbard Of the Morning	2013-05-18	Oh I fully expect that Coldhands scene to be in this week.
5907	go joff go	2013-05-18	Yeah I think that is one of the drawbacks of Tyrions whitewashing is that its going to seem creul for Sansa to refuse to kneel, but still she is totally in the right and I definitely hope they keep that scene in.  I mean the Lannisters are about to slaughter her family. Give her a moral victory.  Maybe they will make it a point that it isn't about being a drawf but about being a lannister.
5908	Bastard Walder	2013-05-18	Sansa's actress is so tall. Tyrion will probably need to stand on the backs of everyone at the wedding to get the cloak around her.

Maybe they will make it a point that it isn't about being a drawf but about being a lannister.But it is about him being a dwarf, and her reaction to him being a dwarf is absolutely normal.
5910	Dove	2013-05-18	Sansa's actress is so tall. Tyrion will probably need to stand on the backs of everyone at the wedding to get the cloak around her.When I saw how much she'd grown during the season premiere all I could think was "awww yeah this is gonna make the wedding even more awkward".From the way Tyrion looks in the preview for this episode I'm hoping we'll start to see a darker side of him. I really hope they don't go with a Sansa as the dutiful wife/Tyrion as the reluctant husband who turns her away dynamic to keep his character nice and pristine because blech. That would definitely continue the trend of robbing other characters of their growth to keep Tyrion likeable and goody-goody.It would be super great if his and Sansa's marriage is more like the books and that's what starts his downward spiral a bit, but uugghh then even more dumb people are gonna hate Sansa with a passion and IDK if I want to deal with reading all of that. Basically show Tyrion is likeable but I'd love him more if he was like his more flawed counterpart in the books and I'm hoping this is the beginning of that.
5911	bobbybuilderton	2013-05-18	I wonder if they'll explain the bedding ritual through more drunk Cersei taunting Sansa exposition. I can totally see her giving similar advice to what Jaime told Brienne.
5912	ebevan91	2013-05-18	Oh I fully expect that Coldhands scene to be in this week.It'll give the "Unsullied" something new to talk about for sure.

Anyway, I'm interested to see the Sam the slayer scene.  One thing I realized during my rewatch of last weeks episode is that one way you know that scene was meant to be in that episode is that it makes Osha's monologue more sensible in its placement as it tells the viewers that an ordinary knife would work against wights

From the end of that thread.Those who enjoy reading truly unsullied posters are merely pointing out that those who are spoiled are pushing the real unsullied in the right direction and thus tainting their analysis by providing them with 'spitballsThat's accusatory gossip.  About members of another forum and their allegedly 'dishonest' postings.  The point of the thread was to observe and enjoy the Unsullied's reactions, observations and spitballs about the show.

It was to long.Personally I think you should calm down a bit about it. The second anyone mentions anyone even very generally, or even that there COULD BE fakers there, you jump all over them. Look at the first version of the thread and how far it strayed before being closed. Then there was a new one created. We should let the mods point out problems of their are any, and just remind people of the rules if we get to far off topic.Back on subject of episode eight: Has submitted a "MAJOR SPOILERS" thread. We know they will come.
5919	go joff go	2013-05-18	Ha I submitted a spoiler thread too and I know that a couple of others have too..  Hopefully the mods will get it up before the inevitable leaks.
5920	eRome	2013-05-18	I haven't been impressed by this season. At all.
I was hoping for so much more. Maybe I'm just getting older and becoming more cynical.
In addition to the story moving too fast (Dany takes her Unsullied in episode 4?) I don't think the writting has been very good, especially compared to S1 when so much of it came directly out of AGOT.
The big event of the book was just so underwhelming too - the burning of Astapor wasn't grand enough...
I will say the fight between the Hound and Lord Berric was great though...
I just hope tomorrow night is better...

Nevertheless, that site is still a very interesting read.  We just can't discuss it here.  getting back on topic, I can't wait till the next espisode.  I think part of why I have been so harsh on the last two was that I was spoiled ahead of time, especially 2 weeks ago about Ros' demise.  It didn't come as a shocker.  1 wedding today, two more to come. Bwahahahahahaha.
5922	teej6	2013-05-19	As good as it was in the books I don't think the will is going to happen. We got to remember that ASoS was released 13 YEARS AGO and the will has never been brought up since. I think GRRM was undecided on what direction he was going to take for Jon so he put in in just in case to open up potential storylines and then abandoned it. Besides, the will is kinda moot since Stannis or another king/queen can always legitimize him if need be.The will hasn't been brought up since ASOS because there wasn't an opportunity or reason for it. The people who were most likely privy to the knowledge of the contents of the will haven't turned up. Jon is one of, if not the, main characters of the story and I think GRRM has probably always had a pretty good idea as to where Jon's storyline was going. But I agree the discussion of the will may not be on the show because it would be too spoilerish in regards to Robb's fate for the viewers.
5923	BurningCandle	2013-05-19	I'm wondering how they are going to handle the bedding scene between Tyrion & Sansa. I know nothing actually happens, but they're still both naked, and I believe the actress is underage (only 17). I'm wondering if they don't just cut the whole thing out and allude to it after the fact the same way they did with him telling her. I can only imagine the scene would be awkward as hell for the actors.
5924	LordStoneheart	2013-05-19	Oh no... I just thought of something horrid...On the wiki talk page for Catelyn the editors had a discussion about why its Catelyn Tully and not Stark. The consensus seemed to be that woman don't necessarily take their husbands last name in Westeros. Catelyn is Lady of Winterfell, but not Lady Stark. But in the show women definitely take their husband's last names (S1 - Tyrion capture scene "I was still Catelyn Tully when I was here last...)That means in the show Sansa will be Sansa Lannister. Barf. Fucking barf. Especially since in the books she still looks back and thinks of Tyrion as her husbands since the High Septon didn't annul it. On a side note, I really do hope she doesn't kneel. I don't care how white washed Tyrion is. Decent people will see a scared girl forced into a marriage doing the only thing she can to defy them, and insensitive (there are much worse adjectives I could use but I better not) people will say Sansa was a bitch to him for doing it.

But is it remotely, like .00008% chance, possible that the GW and the PW are combined in this ep?Could 'spending the night together' for them mean spending the night in the cells?That's way too many major changes for me to enjoy even with Joffrey croaking, but I wouldn't be surprised if D&D did that.

Well, I always thought she made it worse for herself by not kneeling. When she refused they made her husband climb on the back of a fool. I'm sure if the marriage had lasted more than a few weeks that would have followed her around forever. It's bad enough everything she was pushed in to, she didn't need to be mocked too. But I certainly understand why she refused to kneel.This is crackpot speculation and I would actually be pissed if it was so...

I understand in the books their is good evidence the PW was planned before the Tyrells arrived in KL but I do not think that is the case in the show.  I think they will want to show the idea to start coming together especially when Oleena sees him.  With the wedding and the tile I really hope he finally shows up.  I thought he would of been present more if only in background of some KL scenes.

See, I too can waste time and energy accusing the showrunners of potential changes that are never going to happen.

5941	Rashtibram	2013-05-19	I don't know why everyone assumes that the older gent that Bran meets is going to be Cold Hands. It seems to me way too early in the story for that, even taking into consideration how far the TV series is from the books. Cold Hands meets Sam and Gilly first, and they have to pass under the wall to give Bran's party a way through.I think that the older gent must therefore be the Liddle they meet in the mountains just south of the wall.("Storm of Swords" Chapter 24)Bran doesn't meet an older gentleman. Sam and Gilly do. read the synopsis again.

It's not like anyone's being deprived of much here.  It's human nature to want as much info as possible about our favorite things.  But honestly, if you watch the episode without having all the important things spoiled for you, it will be that much more enjoyable at the time.
5943	Rashtibram	2013-05-19	As for the Iron Island story : I could see a scene ending with Yara contemplating the ocean and a ship sailing towards the island... and her saying : "My father is dead... My uncle comes back..." that would be amazing to introduce a story arc for the next season...I'm almost positive they'll have Balon's death this season. There's a clip from the trailer with Yara walking purposefully through a crowd of ironborn, but it will probably be in episode 10 seeing as there's no mention of him in this week's previews/screencaps/synopsis.

5948	ServantOnIce	2013-05-19	I don't think they'll cut it entirely, because it's in the official synopsis that they spend the night together. Maybe they'll just have the scene without nudity, or reduced clothing so that everything's kosher regarding Sophie's (Sansa's actor) age.I think D and D will have them  hook up . . .  it is going to be a big, "change" from the books.

5950	SeventySeven	2013-05-19	I think D and D will have them  hook up . . .  it is going to be a big, "change" from the books.I very much doubt it. The only thing they might change is Sansa being conflicted about the fact she isn't actually that unhappy with him, and I'm doubtful about this one too. They most definitely will not have sex though.

Maybe they'll just have the scene without nudity, or reduced clothing so that everything's kosher regarding Sophie's (Sansa's actor) age.I suspect they will have the wedding and then cut to a scene with the two of them in bed with their bodies under the sheets, awkwardly saying good night.

They most definitely will not have sex though.Yeah, I'm anticipating them having a relatively cordial marriage.
5953	FullMoonHowl	2013-05-19	Someone on IMDB said the episode came on demand early, not sure if this is true. but these are the plot points he posted
- Dany meets Titan's Bastard/Darrio
- Tyrion marries Sansa
- Melisandre uses leeches on Gendry and predicts the Kings deaths
- Balon Greyjoy falls off a bridge on dies
New scenes:
- Roose Bolton stops off at the Dreadfort while travelling to Edmure's wedding. A scene between him and Ramsay.
- CONTROVERSIAL: A scene between Tywin and Shae. I don't think anymore needs to be said.
5954	SeventySeven	2013-05-19	Yeah, I'm anticipating them having a relatively cordial marriage.Tbh, it would make it a bit more interesting that way. She's married into the family who made her life a living hell and destroyed her own family. Tyrion isn't directly involved, but he's with them. So it would be good to see her conflicted between hating the Lannisters and not wanting any Lannister, and actually not being that displeased with her husband, because he's a good man to her. It would also finally give Sansa some more emotions to express and something else to do than being consistently manipulated by everyone.
5955	Darth Zyroth	2013-05-19	So.... No pictures????!!!!
5956	King Tommen	2013-05-19	This sounds like a snore.Yeah,- Sam the Slayer- Tyrion and Sansa wedding / bedding- Introduction of Daario- Burning of the leeches- First appearance of Coldhands- Cersei explaining origin of "Rains of Castamere"- Arya and the Hound- Dany/Missandei bath scene- Tyrion and Joffrey blow up (possibly Tyrion accusing Joff of Bran assassin)- Daario bringing the sellsword heads to DanySuper snoozer...
5957	genesis	2013-05-19	Roose Bolton travelling from Harenhal to the Twins stops at the Dreadford? Non-Eucledean geometry galore...
Also, Balon Greyjoy simply falls from the bridge? No Faceless men in sight? That's disappointing.

Unless Bolton has borrowed Littlefinger's TARDIS, there's no way he could get from Harrenhal to the Dreadfort and back to the Twins in three episodes. I'm going to guess that he's making shit up.

5961	King Tommen	2013-05-19	That scene with Bolton sounds like bullshit. Unless Bolton has borrowed Littlefinger's TARDIS, there's no way he could get from Harrenhal to the Dreadfort and back to the Twins in three episodes. I'm going to guess that he's making shit up.It sounds like BS to me.  Most of the stuff is right from the synopsis and the stuff that's not doesn't sound right in terms of timing or logistics. The Dreadfort is not remotely conceivably "on the way" to the Twins.I highly doubt that Balon would simply appear in an episode without there being something in the "Previously on" segment to remind the audience of who the hell he is.  If he's dying this season, it's in the finale.

For all these!!- I wonder how the wedding is going to go.- So they are not having sex? Good..- I'm sure Balon falling will be a great scene, and it'll be interesting to see if there is a FM.New scenes:- Roose Bolton stops off at the Dreadfort while travelling to Edmure's wedding.

5963	YTDN	2013-05-19	Wut the fuck ?Only Littlefinger can teleport !This is also way more ridiculous than the Littlefinger teleportation. LF went from King's Landing to the Stormlands to Harrenhal in three episodes, not across half the freaking map. I'm going to assume IMDb guy is trolling.
5964	TomBadgerlock	2013-05-19	- How is that even possible??!!!! Now he has a plain to go past the Twins and come back????!!! And before the wedding??!!! Or did he steal LF teleporter????!!!- Shae and Tywin???!!!I suppose it's possible that they could change the location of the Dreadfort and make them a Riverlands house, somewhere between Harrenhal and The Twins but...I don't see the point of that. So far as I remember, Roose was first introduced in the second seasons, after they were already in the Riverlands.
5965	King Tommen	2013-05-19	Another good reason to call BS on this is that they don't even mention anything about Sam the Slayer or the intro of Coldhands which would be two of the major WTF moments from the episode.

5967	Dove	2013-05-19	There's no way those are real. Logistics of travel aside (which can always be waived to a certain extent for good drama) I highly doubt they're going to show Roose and Ramsay interacting an episode before the RW after all this hush-hush mystery business about Ramsay's identity and Theon's whereabouts.
5968	FullMoonHowl	2013-05-19	Another good reason to call BS on this is that they don't even mention anything about Sam the Slayer or the intro of Coldhands which would be two of the major WTF moments from the episode.That's what i was thinking as well.

Unless Bolton has borrowed Littlefinger's TARDIS, there's no way he could get from Harrenhal to the Dreadfort and back to the Twins in three episodes. I'm going to guess that he's making shit up.Plus they explicitly said Lord Frey wanted the wedding to be in two weeks. They were delayed a day by the rain. That means Bolton would have to get from Harrenhal to the Dreadfort to the Twins in about 16 days. Yeah no. The map on the viewers guide has the Dreadfort exactly where it should be, so this is not possible. Literally impossible. LF is the only one allowed to move at the speed of the plot. No one else.
5970	Queen of Whores	2013-05-19	I'm disappointed that we'll get no more leaked pics, but also kind of glad. They would have just been too tempting to not look at, however many vows I swore to not look at the 3x9 and 3x10 pics. Oh well, we'll always have the dead Ros leak.
It's also a testament to how hot Emilia Clarke is when a possible nude scene of hers ranks up there with Sam and Slayer, Coldhands, Tyrion and Sansa's wedding and the leech burning in terms of excitement.

Everything that in the book has been left unsolved, has been explained in the show. Or they've left it out altogether.

6004	Newstar	2013-05-19	Also who in their fucking mind wants to see Charles Dance going doggystyle? Holy crap.One of Charles Dance's anecdotes that he gives in Game of Thrones-related interviews these days is how when he was first approached by the showrunners to play Tywin, he complained about all the sex ("rumpy-pumpy" as he hilariously put it) on the show being doggy-style (which it was as of Season 1, the writers have been branching out a bit since). The showrunners responded with something like "We wanted it to be animalistic" and Charles Dance was all "Well, it's certainly that." Ha!As much as I take the spoilers with a ton of salt--no screencaps, hmmmm---I can buy that the writers would give Charles Dance a scene where he had to simulate doggy-style sex as a bit of an inside joke.(I remember that Diana Rigg also complained about all the sex when she first got involved with the show, although I doubt she specifically objected to doggy-style sex. Lucky for her, I guess, else we might be subjected to a scene of Olenna being banged by Cheese Boy from 3x02 or something.)As for the spoiler being true or not...hmm...I have this "You couldn't make this stuff up" feeling about it. Like, it's so outrageous, how could someone come up with it?This is why i hate that Missandei is an adult in the show.Well, if it weren't Missandei (and Irri had lived), it would probably be Irri.Also who in their fucking mind wants to see Charles Dance going doggystyle?Right here. (Sorry not sorry.)

I really feel like they're going to bring it for the next three episodes. I personally don't even think episode 9 will be the climax as usual. It will be a big episode but I think it will be more like a two parter with episode 10 continuing the action. Episode 1 of season 4 will be the "aftermath" episode that episode 10 usually is. At least I hope so.

I can't quit you.edit: also yeah we can't say what's going on for sure in that Dany/Missandei scene just based on one very out-of-context picture released by HBO, no sense complaining about it already, haha.Maybe it'll end up being a sex scene but we'll get some sexposition about the dragons?

It's not like the sex scenes between Loras and Renly or that LF's spy/squire where we see their characters explored and the plot moves forward. When it's women it's just for the audience to get horny.Tbf, sex scenes can titillate anyone depending on whatever floats your boat. I find sex scenes between women pretty hot for instance, and I'm a straight female. What grossed me out in the LF scene was his sleazy presence and talking. Ugh.Umm, you mean like that scene in the books with Dany and Irri?This.ETA:http://www.telegraph...ess-scenes.html - could be that it's not happening, or at least Dany won't be nude. If this is talking about Emilia, and this season not the next one.Whoever it is, poor girl, I sympathize.LOL at Oona spreading gossip about her castmates.

6020	King Tommen	2013-05-19	I think people might be extrapolating the Missandei/Dany scene.  By no means do I think it's going to be a lesbian "going at it" scene.  Dany will get naked to have a bath and Missandei will be helping her with said bath.  There might be a little sexual tension displayed but it is probably a scene that is a lot closer to "Emilia gets naked" than "Missandei and Dany go to town on each other".
And please direct all of your "lesbian titillation" holier-than-thou complaints to GRRM who has had two of his straight female characters (Dany and Cersei) engage in very graphic and random bi-curious adventures for reasons that you'd have a very hard time convincing me were anything other than titillation.

Much more than in the show where it's most tits and ass.Granted the books do have a problem with sexualizing certain female characters, like making how most of the dark skinned women in the series are so sexual in comparision to most of the white women. But that's for another topic I think. /dunno.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':dunno:' />

I think titillation was more of a factor in the Dany/irri scene but the Cersei/Taena scene wasn't supposed to be sexy at all imo.I think it odd that you call these characters straight when they engage in same sex relations. Surely that's an indication that they aren't straight, rather than a sign of Martin suddenly doing a 180 in regards to his attitude to sex scenes for no reason.
6023	blackeyedlily	2013-05-19	Seems like a very good episode, although kind of disappointing if this is the first time we see Davos since episode 1. Yet again I really want to see that conversation!Davos was in Episode 5 as well.
6024	Newstar	2013-05-19	To be fair, the IMDB poster spoiling (or "spoiling") the episode stated that there was no visible nudity in the bath scene, so I'm guessing no more skin will be shown than you might see in a PG-rated bath scene in a network show: arms, shoulders, collarbones, a bit of cleavage, and that's all.
Other spoilers (or "spoilers") from IMDB from the same poster:
	Spoiler Balon's death (falling off a bridge) and funeral are shown; Yara makes an appearance at the latter. No Lysa, but Lysa is in the 3x09 promo. The "Every man, woman and child put to the sword" line from Cersei references not the story of the Reynes and the Tarbecks but Tywin's sack of King's Landing. I think there's supposed to be a scene as well where Roose stops by the Dreadfort and meets up with Ramsay.
Coldhands will appear. The actor playing Coldhands will confirm a long-standing fan theory about his identity.
There doesn't seem to be any preamble to Tywin/Shae banging besides them exchanging a glance at the wedding feast, although I think we know from the 3x08 stills that Tyrion has a runin with Shae prior to the wedding, as there's a 3x08 still with Tyrion in his wedding outfit with Shae in Sansa's chambers.

Surely that's an indication that they aren't straight, rather than a sign of Martin suddenly doing a 180 in regards to his attitude to sex scenes for no reason.Having sex with a partner of the same sex as you doesn't mean much in itself. It can be curiosity, the situation, etc. For instance, in Cersei's case she pretty much says she doesn't enjoy her lesbian encounter at all. I'd say both Cersei and Dany are straight because they never really seem interested in women... They just happen to sleep with women at some point.

	Spoiler "The actor playing Coldhands will confirm a long-standing fan theory about his identity." That part hasn't even been revealed in the books, so they're not going to reveal it in the show.
Also the Tywin/Shae thing, I see no reason why they would both ruin the reveal of Shae's betrayal in Season 4, and lose the chance for more Tyrion/Shae angst.

Yeah, I wasn't getting at you. I'm just 99.999999999% that these spoilers are fake, and it's annoying seeing everyone get their knickers in a twist about it.Of course, if they do turn out to be true I'll end up looking rather silly. Seven hours!

6034	King Tommen	2013-05-19	Both scenes had purposes. Dany's scene demonstrated her isolation, Cersei's scene demonstrated her desire for dominance and sexual power after years of enduring Robert. I think titillation was more of a factor in the Dany/irri scene but the Cersei/Taena scene wasn't supposed to be sexy at all imo.I think it odd that you call these characters straight when they engage in same sex relations. Surely that's an indication that they aren't straight, rather than a sign of Martin suddenly doing a 180 in regards to his attitude to sex scenes for no reason.And I suppose I could make the argument that all of the sex scenes on the show had a purpose as well.  We can call it even.As far as whether you want to call Dany or Cersei "straight" or not, you can parse the semantics I guess but I think the point I was trying to make was that these are POV characters which provide us an insight into their innermost thoughts and desires.  I think it's very clear that both these ladies very clearly feel romantic love and desires for people of the opposite sex.  The two isolated encounters with the same sex partners come about from them being either lonely/bored or curious to try something different.  To me, that doesn't indicate bisexuality, it's the old "I'm at college, let's experiment to see what this is like" kind of situation.

Well, what happened one time was that the episode was on xfinity early. You could see it listed there even if you couldn't watch. I went to check and it was true. I couldn't watch because I don't have any subscriptions or anything though.So since the episode is not listed here http://xfinitytv.com...614114910789112I would assume that they are full of crap
6037	PatrickStormborn	2013-05-19	I think it odd that you call these characters straight when they engage in same sex relations. Surely that's an indication that they aren't straight, rather than a sign of Martin suddenly doing a 180 in regards to his attitude to sex scenes for no reason. I agree that Dany probably isn't 100% straight because of the way she describes Irri. Moreover, she only seems to stop having sex with Irri because it's clear Irri isn't sexually attracted to Daenerys.I wouldn't call Cersei bisexual though. In fact, she doesn't seem able to enjoy sex at all unless it's with Jaime. Cersei's sex scenes in AFfC highlight this, regardless of whether they're with a man or woman.
6038	The Monkey	2013-05-19	http://www.telegraph...ess-scenes.html - could be that it's not happening, or at least Dany won't be nude. If this is talking about Emilia, and this season not the next one.Whoever it is, poor girl, I sympathize.Could be Shae though. We haven't seen her nude since S1 IIRC.
6039	protar	2013-05-19	Having sex with a partner of the same sex as you doesn't mean much in itself. It can be curiosity, the situation, etc. For instance, in Cersei's case she pretty much says she doesn't enjoy her lesbian encounter at all. I'd say both Cersei and Dany are straight because they never really seem interested in women... They just happen to sleep with women at some point.I'd say that showing even situational interest in the same sex demonstrates that they're at least partially not straight. The Kinsey Scale and all that. And I think that Dany definitely shows more than a passing interest in Irri.Cersei certainly doesn't enjoy it though and like Patrick says up thread she seems to be purely Jaime-sexual.
6040	protar	2013-05-19	Could be Shae though. We haven't seen her nude since S1 IIRC.I don't think that matches up. Sibel Kikelli was nude like once, whereas apparently the person referred to in the article was nude a lot in S1. Esme and Emilia are the only people who fit that category.
6041	FuriousGeorge	2013-05-19	I don't think that matches up. Sibel Kikelli was nude like once, whereas apparently the person referred to in the article was nude a lot in S1. Esme and Emilia are the only people who fit that category.Obviously Esme...and that's why she dead. With regards to Coldhands that guy has to be talking shit!
6042	King Tommen	2013-05-19	I don't think that matches up. Sibel Kikelli was nude like once, whereas apparently the person referred to in the article was nude a lot in S1. Esme and Emilia are the only people who fit that category.Yeah, hard to say.  A few notes:1) Oona states it's someone who was naked in S1 and S2 (and Emilia wasn't naked at all in S2).2) When Emilia was interviewed on Jimmy Kimmel before this season started, they had a chat about how it was uncomfortable for her to have her grandparents watch some of her nude scenes in S1.  Then Jimmy asked her if there was anything coming up this season that would get her grandparents embarrassed again and she said "Maybe" with a smirk on her face.Neither of those things is anything close to a confirmation but I had always assumed that she'd be getting naked again this season at some point.
6043	Arkash	2013-05-19	That almost sounds like a fun idea for a thread. "Make up wild fake spoilers about the next episode"I agree with this ! =D
6044	The Scabbard Of the Morning	2013-05-19	If the thing was released early there would be more than one person who watched it, the fact we've not seen anyone corroborate the story, plus the absurd rumor of Roose, should be enough to tell you that it's fake.
6045	Onion Seaworth	2013-05-19	^^ Yeah, I'm calling bullshit on his 'spoilers', just from this:
	Spoiler "The actor playing Coldhands will confirm a long-standing fan theory about his identity." That part hasn't even been revealed in the books, so they're not going to reveal it in the show.Also the Tywin/Shae thing, I see no reason why they would both ruin the reveal of Shae's betrayal in Season 4, and lose the chance for more Tyrion/Shae angst.
The show might just confirm it, like it confirmed it was Varys and Illyrio speaking in the Red keep when arya eavesdropped.I actually hope its Benjen i loved him in the show.Or they are just merging Benjen and Coldhands.still ''they killed him long ago'' could be a metaphor or something.Like the way the gravedigger says ''the hound'' is dead. Something about Benjen got ''killed long ago''...i don't know. just a theory.
6046	King Tommen	2013-05-19	The other thing that mainly makes this IMDB thing BS is that the storylines he's mainly referencing are nowhere to be found in either the "previously on" clip or the episode 8 preview.  These 2 videos have historically been very comprehensive when it comes to what we'll be seeing in the episode (especially the "previously on" recaps).  They don't leave out storylines that they're covering off and they certainly make a point of showing you older scenes (even from previous seasons) if they need to catch the audience up on something or provide a reminder of who a character is.
You can see that for this episode, we'll have:
Sam and Gilly
Tyrion/Sansa/Shae/Tywin/Cersei/Margaery/Joffrey
Dragonstone (including a returning Mel and Gendry)
Dany
Arya and the Hound
This guy also has
- Roose teleporting to the Dreadfort to talk to Ramsay and Theon (none of whom are referenced in either of these clips)
- Balon dying
- Yara appearing
- Benjen showing up as Coldhands
If any of these things were taking place in the episode, than the "previously on" recap would provide you with a reminder of who these people are and what they've been up to (especially since most of them haven't been around for a long time.)
6047	The Scabbard Of the Morning	2013-05-19	Varys and Ilyrio was confirmed by Martin long long ago before the show.
6048	WhiteGuts	2013-05-19	I'd say that showing even situational interest in the same sex demonstrates that they're at least partially not straight. The Kinsey Scale and all that. And I think that Dany definitely shows more than a passing interest in Irri.Cersei certainly doesn't enjoy it though and like Patrick says up thread she seems to be purely Jaime-sexual.The fact she slept with other men when Jaime was captive prooves this to be false.
6049	protar	2013-05-19	The fact she slept with other men when Jaime was captive prooves this to be false.And as with Taena she shows no real sign of enjoying it.

6051	Red Hound	2013-05-19	I'll say this and I may regret at some point in the future, but I'd actually like if Benjen is confirmed as Coldhands.About the lesbian-oriented scenes in the books, my only problem, to say so, is that no female character is fully homosexual. It's always women being bi-curious. There's a handful of gay male characters, but not a single (that we know) full lesbian. Myranda's chat with Sansa seems like going in the same direction as Cersei or Daenerys.

6063	bobbybuilderton	2013-05-19	I can't think of any reason why Cersei talking about the sack of King's Landing would fit with what we hear of her dialogue. When did anyone who planned to sack King's Landing want to put every man, woman, and child to the sword? Unless she's talking about some command Joffrey wanted to give. Except we know he is uncontrollable and if he wanted to have them all killed, he would have.Here's something I put in another thread for your considerationTywin did mention it a lil bit when Arya was his cupbearer, but I don't think we've had anyone explain the full story or why the song Bronn sang in Blackwater is the Lannister song.http://youtu.be/U8OyYZSPh8g?t=9m -talking about Tywin's fatherhttp://www.youtube.c...h?v=Kz1oaEuPmBM -finding out the song is related to the Lannisters in-universeNot much mention beyond that. People believe it will be mentioned in episode 8, because in the preview, Cersei talks about "every man, woman, and child put to the sword" and there was another line in an earlier trailer with Tyrion asking "how long does it go on?" and she says "until we've dealt with all our enemies"http://www.youtube.c...h?v=yd9nOdeJf7Q -every man woman, and child . . .http://www.youtube.c...h?v=p4iljcuzjG8 -until we've dealt . . .she even seems to be wearing the same dress, so they are probably part of the same conversation.

COME ON I DON'T BELIEVE THIS)Coldhands is basically confirmed to be Benjen.No Sam the Slayer this episode.Balon falls off a bridge and dies.  He has a funeral after the leeches scene and Asha is there.  Roose stops at the Dreadfort to meet RamsayLysa is in next week's episode.Bath scene between Missandei and Emilia but no nudity.Cersei does not tell the story behind Rains of Castamere.  Cersei's quote is her talking about the sack of King's Landing.
how come coldhands is shown without sam the slayer?? slaying takes place way before coldhands.I think the older gentleman will be the other.IIRC Balon dies after 
	Spoiler Robb

The fact that he mentioned masterful intercutting scenes just seems too incidental to have made up, and the fact is that this episode was directed by Michelle MacLaren who directed Gliding All Over, the most recent Breaking Bad episode which contained some of the best intercutting directing I have ever seen on TV.

The fact that he mentioned masterful intercutting scenes just seems too incidental to have made up, and the fact is that this episode was directed by Michelle MacLaren who directed Gliding All Over, the most recent Breaking Bad episode which contained some of the best intercutting directing I have ever seen on TV.One thing he said is proven false, he claims that there isn't Sam the Slayer, while that is showed in the preview the recap makes a big deal out of the dragonglass dagger.Also some things just don't make any sense. Teleporting Roose and Doggy Style Tywin.
6072	IPSidorov	2013-05-19	Can we please forget about this?
6073	bobbybuilderton	2013-05-19	oh my gosh are we some of you getting mad at D&D for fake spoilers on IMDB nowC'mon, y'all. /lol.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lol:' />I don't think anyone has gotten mad...more annoyed at how bad it would be on the off chance that they're not fake.I think people jump to conclusions a lot. But I also stand by my opinion that if they ruin Shae betraying Tyrion by having unsullied wonder what will happen when Tyrion finds out she's having sex with Tywin, they should let someone else take over. I think it's ridiculous that that will happen, but I also think that if it does, it'd be stupid. THAT'S what people are mad (or what you call mad, at least) about, I think. No one is really mad at this point but they will be if some of this is true. Again, that doesn't necessarily mean that they believe the spoilers are real. As far as I can see, nearly everyone has stated that these "spoilers" are crap.
6074	Dove	2013-05-19	True enough, that's pretty much well-known as Michelle MacLaren's thing now.I just have trouble seeing them as real or taking them seriously because of the general shiftiness of it - some guy on IMDB with a history of goofy posts, no pictures because vague reasons, sort of 'off' sounding content, etc.In the last thread someone mentioned Leakbro getting banned from 4chan or something? That's probably why the leaks didn't happen this week, but IDK. I think if he took his thing to another website he'd be ready to pony up more screencaps.edit: aaand you guys still post fast~~ was replying to TomBadgerlock, for context.

Love her.Oh, and I'm not mad at all.  I don't believe them (okay, 10% believe them), but that little fraction is because D&D have done some totally wacky things before that I would have called total BS on if someone "spoiled" it.

Actually it would be a godsend if they turned out to be nonsense, because storyline decisions they have taken this season, make it sound very possible.

							Edited by Cybvep, 19 May 2013 - 03:39 PM.
6081	Dragonstoned	2013-05-19	The thread had got quite long, but it was likely closed cos of people supposing that the unsullied were actually sullied i.e. had read the books and were spoiling it for others.
6082	iheartseverus	2013-05-19	Think severus is in mourning R.I.P. the unsullied thread...HAHA, poof!  Y'all command and I appear!  Not in mourning at all, but spending much forum time over at TWoP, episode threads, wardrobing thread and Dramatis Personae are all quite interesting.Anyway, last Sunday afternoon, we had some great fun in the Spoilers thread here with this guy's hilarious vids.  If you didn't go into that thread, you wouldn't have seen these.  Anyway, just bringing in some levity to while away the afternoon while we wait for tonight.The description of these is 'a confused German man wakes up and tries to describe Game of Thrones.'  He is actually Flula Borg, a German teacher.http://www.youtube.c...h?v=ShOqv1pyFjEhttp://www.youtube.c...h?v=VteJKW-Uij4Here are his episode vids.  Have fun!http://www.youtube.c...ube.vOyPLNbhyoM:

And to give credit where its due, it was DarkAndFullOfTurnips who discovered Flula last week and brought him here.  A lot of us spent the rest of that day laughing out loud.  Great fun.

6092	Weeping Sore	2013-05-19	If you've been in a cave cut off from civilisation with a tree man for thousands of years, would you not get bored? To a bored person, "a long time ago" could easily be yesterday! Or at least to me .."...they killed him long ago..." To me it's just a word choice more fitting to Leaf's archaic diction than "...they killed him already..." which is the meaning in context. Benjen is still the most obvious Coldhands candidate. Can't wait to see him tonight!
6093	bobbybuilderton	2013-05-19	Isn't coldhands supposed to have his face covered? How could they reveal the identity of him? I imagine those unsullied who don't trust Jojen and Meera will have a field day when Coldhands gets thrown in the mix. There are people who think Jojen is being suspicious for not telling Osha anything and wanting to bring Bran north of the wall. It's pretty hilarious. Especially because they could have avoided people mistrusting them by just introducing them last season.
6094	teemo	2013-05-19	where is our major spoilers thread?
6095	TomBadgerlock	2013-05-19	where is our major spoilers thread?I think this is effectively it.

6098	iheartseverus	2013-05-19	i thought iheartseverus posted oneI sent the proposed thread to the Mods--the fact that they didn't approve it probably means they already knew that our spoiler source (R.I.P.) was done and gone.
6099	Swagwell	2013-05-19	I am so offended by some things in this thread, why does a Tywin/Shae doggystyle scene turn you off?
Are you all age-ist? Everybody else gets their fair share of shagging but not the most enjoyable character in the show?
He deserves it and you all know it.
And it is not gratuitous(learned that word on this forum BTW), it serves the purpose of establishing the softer side of Tywin because he will take a dump and cry about his dead wife afterwards.
6100	TomBadgerlock	2013-05-19	I sent the proposed thread to the Mods--the fact that they didn't approve it probably means they already knew that our spoiler source (R.I.P.) was done and gone.Some thread I started for last week's episode took a couple of days to get approved so they're probably just busy at the moment.
6101	iheartseverus	2013-05-19	These are the best! Thanks for the links.Isn't he great?  He does that goofy looking blank stare perfectly.  And I love the fact that he's always either sitting on his rumpled unmade bed or he's in the bathroom and there's the roll of toilet paper behind him!  The guy's got a natural genius for comic staging.  Can't wait to see what he's got in mind for tonight's episode.  And then, for Rains of Castemere!
6102	bobbybuilderton	2013-05-19	Off topic, but it would bring me endless joy if people who watch with unsullied could record them as they watch episode 9. I would die happy if I could see the raw reactions to what transpires.
6103	teemo	2013-05-19	I'm not grossed out by it at all.  It just seems really out there.  I can't imagine it intercutting with the Tyrion/Sansa wedding in the way he's describing.  I guess it's possible, but it sounds far-fetched.  For me at least, the sex actually had nothing to do with it.  At all, actually.  Sex on television in any form between anyone doesn't faze me in the slightest.  The bizarreness is what was jarring to me.

6104	King of the Road	2013-05-19	Umm, you mean like that scene in the books with Dany and Irri?Exactly. Titillation is in the books as well as the TV series.
6105	Honourable Ser	2013-05-19	Exactly. Titillation is in the books as well as the TV series.Erm, GRRM is far better than David and Dan, Dany's storyline was actually advanced by the lesbian sex. In no way was it just some sort of creepy fantasy put down in ink. How dare you suggest it!

Same reason we won't see Oberyn S3.

6107	Saltcliffe	2013-05-19	I really doubt that Roose meets up with Ramsay, just because I've heard Iwan Rheon and Alfie Allen are both billed for 6 episodes this season and you can't really have one appearing without the other at this point. There's nothing about Theon in the previews/recap, so there'll be nothing in the show.
