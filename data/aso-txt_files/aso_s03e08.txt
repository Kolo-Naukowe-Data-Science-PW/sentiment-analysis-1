"Khal Pono",2013-05-19,"that episode was dynamite id call it my favorite from season 3 so far it gets us back on track after two mediocre episodes heres what i loved lots of choice dialogue straight from the book especially during the wedding scene and during danys parley with the second sons the stannisdavos conversation in the cell was fairly faithful to similar conversations from the book lots of clever little winks and nods as well as a metaconversation about winking itself i love that dany is struggling with the same dothraki phrase that irri was trying to teach her in season 1 some cool foreshadowing too note that after melisandre burns the leeches they cut straight to joffrey drinking a cup of wine i love it in the tub scene there may also have been a bit of teasingforeshadowing of forthcoming scenes involving missandei serving dany lots of good oldfashioned got nudity how ravishing was carice van houten in the gendry sex scene it boggles my mind that some people think shes not sexy enough to play melisandre in my book it was the hottest scene so far in the entire series and how beautiful was dany rising from the tub as a show of strength which is a callback to gwen christies scene in episode 5 she looked fierce and incredible and it puts the rumors to rest that emilia clarke somehow takes herself too seriously to show ta as falsely reported in articles like this httpwwwtelegraphesssceneshtml dany and daario already have great chemistry which is important meros boorishness was overthetop and hilarious sam the fucking slayer i will agree with those however who complain that it takes away from his slayerness that his brothers werent around to see the deed who will believe him and how fucking cool were the raven and weirwood shots that ought to please a lot of book purists even the biggest departure from the books was handled well and believably with melisandre reluctantly agreeing not to kill the bastard gendry instead of edric for now and just sacrificing the leeches insteadso excited for the last two episodes edited by khal pono 19 may 2013  0933 pm"

"Rashtibram",2013-05-20,"we are all born nude you know we shower nude we have sex nude typically this is an hbo series asoiaf has a lot of sexual themes in it i am fully with you in not understanding why people get so uptight at the end of season 3 because of nudity this is asoiaf on hbo there are lots of non nude shows on channels like abc family  nickelodeon that are available the mel scene was drawn out because she made the point that she wanted to make sure he didnt suspect anything clearly he didntim not uncomfortable with it i think sex and nudity is fine on screen the complaints about sex typically arent about how inappropriate the sex was theyre about how you shouldnt just fill a show with sex that doesnt serve the plot if a sex scene is completely unnecessary i would prefer it to be replaced by something that actually advances the plot or comes from the books"

"rohit39",2013-05-20,"ok this will be my last comment on this because i dont feel like getting bogged down into a lame debate where clearly neither party will change their mindtyrion did some things where sansa was concerned that yes were not in her best interests but sometimes people just dont have the courage or the strength to make the right choices people even good people have weaknesses clearly where tywin lannister is concerned tyrion has some issues so yes he does have free will and he did make some bad choices but i never believed for one instant that tyrion had bad intentions toward sansa ever not while he was hand not when they married and not on their wedding night tywin cersei and joff clearly did thats the difference between the lannisters in the books for mefin smilepng classbbcemoticon alt just to clarify if you reread tyrions chapters from asos there are numerous occasions where his inner monologue thinks that marrying sansa would be a good thing for him because shes comely and in time hopefully would make him lord of winterfell and his heir future lord tyrion has always had ambition and lust both of which appealed to him to be ok with the sansa wedding while i agree he did not have much of a choice and protesting to tywin might have been impossible i doubt tyrion would have chosen otherwise anyway"

even remotely similar to the quarth changes is plain naiveand no he did not say to stop complaining because he phrased it in a different way if you want to defend him become a lawyer because the his statement was clearly critical of viewers who complain about nudity critics view the same show as us elio and linda are not necessarily professional critics yet their critiques of the show are great indepth and insightful every viewer is a critic getting paid to do so doesnt change that it simply means that your writing is held to a higher standard and has an audienceif you had read what i said you would know i said ros was a scapegoat she to many viewers represented hbos boobquotaand you really think that this forums opinions do not affect the show dave and dan casted jason momoa as khal drogo because they saw him suggested on this forumone more thing boardwalk empire takes place during the rise of the flapper movement a movement completely centered around looking and acting sexyeta people keep missing the point i like most i believe do not have a problem with nudity we have a problem that hbo cant give us an episode without forcing nudity into a scene the scenes where nudity occurs naturally are fine think dany in season 1 the problem is scenes where it just happens and youre left thinking wait why did they get naked for that as was the melgendry situation the scene is not the problem it is that hbo forces the sex and nudity into every scene they can i am sure they cant wait for sophie turner sansa to turn 18i didnt compare it to the changes in season two i said that it didnt align itself well with your comment about it being incredibly true to the novels danys story wasnt the only thing that got changes in the second season either and several of those have continued the way they did robbs changes were more significant since he didnt really suffer from the lack of events that dany does in that book although his are of course often off pagehe was critical of them which i already said myself but thats not even remotely the same thing as claiming that someone doesnt have a right to say something being critical to things is a natural part of discussions while claiming that the other person isnt allowed to say anything is diametrically opposed to discussion and you dont have to be a lawyer to point out that someone said something different its basic reading comprehension and good manners to respond to what a person actually saysif you remembered what you wrote you would know that you wrote it was believed that her death meant less forced nudity and i said that anyone who thought that didnt analyze it properly since she was in no way the only one displaying nudity and she was in fact not nude whatsoever this season making the point even heavierwhen dd were starting up the show they directly asked for input from the fans ive been around here since before that now that the show is on the road you dont see that anymore and instead you see them explaining when fans dont really get why things are as they are or they say that they wanted to do something so they did it they are being very clear on that the book readers arent their only viewers as said there are more obvious explanations as to why dany is closer to the book in this season and its because her arc in asos is much more tv friendlyi learned something about the flapper movement now though so thank you for that im not too interested in that time period so ive missed things like that but more knowledge is always goodyour last paragraph shows a lot of the problem people say that they have no problem with nudity but still such scenes seem to be under different rules to be used than everything else that means that they treat nudity differently and obviously theres a problem there as otherwise it would play under the same rules as everything else people that react less to a scene with violence than nuditysex also display a significant problem in our societies furthermore youre also flat out wrong when you state that hbo cant give you an episode without forcing nudity into a scene since theres been three episodes this season without any nudity at all apparently you dont know what youre talking about and criticism towards the show on such basis becomes pretty hollowas for the mel and gendry scene if you cant understand why she got naked there i dont know what to say its extremely obvious that she seduces him to make him forget his skepticism and paranoia and walk into the trap willingly you dont have to like it though as thats not the same matter as understanding why something happens its not even particularly far fetched that the character that consistently dresses like a sex goddess and so often plays on sex and desire in the books behaves like this since mel just seems to have sex with stannis once in the show shes actually seemingly more moderate than her book version"

"Tywin's bastard",2013-05-21,"i know all the arguments but the audience is flatly told by the author that arya is the spitting image and personality of lyanna stark she is not like ned its true but there is no reason to think that cat and lyanna were much like eithersansa is probably more like ned than arya is thoughnot sure that any of the kids are particularly tullylike based on what we know of the tullys and thats probably not suprising the stark kids grew up in the north in winterfell which has completely diferent sensibilities than the riverlands cat was a fish out of water there but the kids all are a part of itnone of them are much like edmure the blackfish lysa or catyes arya is definitely very starkish since shes so closely compared to lyanna i dont think sansa is much arryn either i think shes closer to her mother but also so young and spoiled that she hasnt learned all the good traits yet if they had kept on living in winterfell i think she would have been molded into a new cat as close as children get as everyone is of course always their own person all the things she likes are things that ned doesnt see too much value in so it seems weird to say that shes mainly taking after him i think hes a big part of why shes spoiled while she most likely learns a lot more from cat which is how it should be as shes supposed to learn how to be a lady and she is pretty good at that unlike arya who is even more spoiled"
"juanml82",2013-05-21,"i think sansa got the education we believe her mother wanted for her lady girl but she certainly didnt get her rashness and character i think ned and cat molded her into what they believed a proper southron lady should be but cat is not a proper southron lady she doesnt formally greet tyrion at the crossroads inn nor does any ladylike stuff instead she acts as a lord paramount"

"Ginevra",2013-05-21,"i noticed that too but so far none of my friends who hasnt read the books has commented about it they either didnt pay attention or they simply thought it will be stopped at time as a viewer its a bit shocking to find out they simply will kill two of the main protagonists so far joffrey and robbmaybe they think that gendrys blood isnt good and it wont workyeah we see red herrings in literature and tv so often especially with dramas we have grown immune each and every week it seems like this might really be it for the doctor or for gaius baltar or for carrie mathison but these hardly even phase us because we know they will not be killing off our heroes and their stars those of us whove read the books know that this obviously wasnt the case with grrm but i dont think we knew that until after the middle of book 3 or at least i didnt i thought eddard was some kind of fluke after we lose so many at the red wedding and then joffrey and then tywin its obvious that grrm has no qualms in destroying his beautifully drawn characters"

"7V3N",2013-05-19,"i honestly thought this was the best episode no awkward transitions great pace and all very true to the novels which is not a necessity but when the interpretation matches the content its always a plus really just the best episode of the series to date i was so impressed i was cautious when the gendrymel scene started getting er sexy  but they wrapped it up nicely get a man excited and his heart pumps blood faster plus hbo was able to fit in the boob quota people may complain about how cersei threatened marg but i think it was the perfect display of cerseis paranoia jealousy and violence in her eyes this is her world and if somebody dares to threaten the things she loves and enjoys they will die regretting it i enjoyed daario who i cannot stand in the books he is much more charming the book daario always came across as an asshole the bad boy that girls like this daario comes across as a bad boy but also a charmer and romantic no complaints from me which is rare since i am highly critical i think not having any jon and bran definitely helped as they have been the weak stories this season edited by 7v3n 19 may 2013  0926 pm"

"The Boar of Gore",2013-05-20,"610 disappointed again it jumped around from scene to scene with no unity the dialogue was flat and there was some clumsy exposition the second sons leaders cant act and so much seemed unnecessary did melisandre really have to pretend to sleep with gendry in order to leech him stannis seemed to decide to release davos on a mere whim why didnt the hound tie arya up when he went to sleep why have dario sneak into the tent as an assassin when he was going over to her side at that point why show the 3 picking coins at all what were the ravens there for why did the white walker not kill sam again you cant engage emotionally when things dont make sense"

"Daenerys Must Die",2013-05-20,"thought this was a really well constructed episode  the scenes had a lot of room to breath and the writing was pretty good the titans bastard looked like he would be better suited for spartacus than got but he served his purpose  i found myself really liking daario not sure thats a good or bad thing since i didnt like him in the book but on screen he comes off a bit more likable imo i actually pictured daario in my head to be more like mero just not as vulgar i guess which is why i hated him but as the play it cool prettyboy hes not so bad seems like coldhands could make a good final scene of the season to me  the ravens were a bit of foreshadowing for him which was cool and sam slaying the other was awesome  loved how all you could see was the obsidian dagger with the ice around it just as i imagined when reading it but sam didnt pick up the dagger before he left  i cant remember whether or not its mentioned in the book whether or does or not edit gave it an 8 last week was 7 highest rated were 9s 4  5 i dont give 10s really edited by daenerys must die 20 may 2013  0913 am"

"Loras",2013-05-20,"i gave this episode a 910 i loved the whole sequence on dragonstone barring that scene in episode 3 the dragonstone storyline has been consistently good for the entire season i particularly loved the scene between stannis and davos in the dungeon everything about that scene was masterfully done i really like how they are playing davos as the jiminy cricket to stannis pinnochio once again another fantastic set of scenes featuring daenerys emilia clarke is evolving in the role there is certainly something reptilian about her performance this season that i am really enjoying i also liked the toned down version of daario  though i do wonder whether simplifying this aspect of the story could cause headaches down the line i enjoyed the additional scene with daario and the second sons but i think the theories here are built around some lazy dialogue every dd episode has one particular phrase that gets repeated in different places  or so it seems kl was fantastic as usual it was nice to see almost all of our regular players down there being featured though this season is seriously lacking varys i really like where they are taking cersei this season but i think that due to her reduced screentime that the casual viewer will not have been paying attention to cerseis increasing paranoia my big problem with this episode is really the choice of scenes to include why not have sam the slayer and oshas monologue in the same episode it seems quite tacked on to have included this scene at the end of this episode also where on earth is catelyn stark i really thought that s3 would be her season but so far she has appeared for what 20 minutes"
"sastelise",2013-05-20,"finally a good episode i gave it a 9 my only compliant is that they didnt spend enough time on the hound and arya but i continue to be impressed with dany whom i didnt apreciate as much in the books her bathtub scene along with briennes a few episodes ago are the only scenes where the nudity doesnt seem gratuitous both ladies are portrayed as empowered subjects rather than objects"

"Arrow",2013-05-21,"speaking as a laggingbehind book reader im almost to the end of the second book and thoroughly enjoying the more complex and deeper characters and story lines  i dont mind a few spoilers showing up here because the books are so rich in description and complexity of personas that a few spoilers here and there are not going to ruin things for me my perception of the story is being backfilled in slowly and the tv episodes are still full of surprises and i really kind of like it that way i have noticed the character of tyrion has some notable differences in the two versions and i have to wonder where the tv show is going to take him now that theyve changed him so much intriguing its a shame we have to wait two weeks for the next episode on tv but that will give me a great chance to catch up in book 3 so its okay i guess theres a bit of an advantage to having not read the books before hbo started showing the series"

"Arjuous",2013-05-20,"lots of fine points have been made in this thread id like to add just a few more 1 re tyrion the permanent hero  while annoying and at least to book readers downright blasphemous at times i can certainly see them setting up tyrions antihero arch in essos hes always been flawed but as many have pointed out many of those flaws have been whitewashed that does not prevent his eventual descent into a drunken exile however and for tv purposes may serve to enhance it as the disparity will be that much greater i prefer the nuances of the book but i think we still may get the darker side to the tyrionshae ending if only because it is so vital to setting up his depressed arch in essos 2 re tv shae  in anticipation of the deluge of negative comments this might attract let me preface this by saying this is only criticism of the story we are being entertained by and my opinions on shae the character shouldnt be read to reveal any moral declarations obviously for anyone whether character or actual person to be stuck in such an economic and sociopolitical sand trap that their only viable escape is to sell themselves is a tragic and depressing set of circumstances  one cannot help but wish these realities were different obviously in a perfect world we should not have to accommodate the moralrelativism im about to embark upon but obviously this is fiction fantasy at that and as such we should be allowed to dive into the world and discuss it freely lengthy disclaimer aside seven hells do i hate tv shae in the most shallow sense shae is poorly acted it was pointed out on the podcast recently but its not her accent its her actual performance however the far more unfortunate part is that tv shae is poorly written and is a severely diminished character as compared to the books while we never get a pov chapter from her she at the very least plays the cards she is dealt rather well she offers tyrion an escape from all his doubts and in return she is provided for tyrion is dealing with ingratitude and deception at every turn yet she is constantly there for him she is what he needs shes as close to a fantasy as he could get whether genuine or not tyrion wants to believe its real so badly that he falls in love with her which makes her betrayal all the more painful more importantly i feel book shae has at least a basic understanding and respect for her position in all of this which tv shae completely lacks case in point whereas book shae reacts with support when she learns of the marriage tv shae is outraged anyone alive in that world at that time would know for a certainty that a whore or even a handmaiden could never marry a lord let alone a lannister yet here tv shae is making tyrions life even more miserable by petitioning him for something everyone in the seven kingdoms knows cannot happen whats more should she be discovered she would  without question  be executed by tywin while in the real world her position is far from enviable given the realities of the world she lives in and her situation preceding her relationship with tyrion tyrion has actually given her a pretty good life in the spectrum of things she is taken care of economically and because of this she no longer has to whore herself out for money which i assume everyone admits is a better situation than she was in befor meeting tyrion note in the books she is obviously still tyrions whore and even proudly refers to herself as such however the tv show has deliberately turned her into tyrions girlfriend so the tv version cannot argue that she is still paid for sex their relationship has been painted as a love story and more importantly she has abandoned the pretense of being a whore unless she is attempting to guilttrip tyrion in which case that statement is only done to prod him to say the contrary that shes not a whore in the show she appreciates none of this she spends nearly every scene bemoaning her situation and chastising tyrion for realities outside of his control she also seems to have no appreciation for peril she would be in should she be discovered and on a few occasions she has risked discovery out of spite as many have pointed out before i dont know why either of them like each other in the show in the books she was his escape his fantasy she was almost tysha reborn in the show well i just dont understand it seems they tried to bolt on a real love story to a situation that was a dozen times more complex and insodoing robbed the original story of its impact"

"Woman of War",2013-05-21,"i like the actress too but they have played up the love story here if they make shae another irrational woman so she can be jealous and then betray tyrion i will think that is cliche and contrived that they boil the character down to jealous bitch cliche i will not like that at all especially as they have made her more complex in the showyes it is irrational to be jealous but arent we all from time to time it is human it the material tragedies are made of and cant complex people have their irrational moments reacting dark and revengeful instead of separation in mutual agreementdont get me wrong it is immoral to foreswear in a situation like this and to add that bit of nastiness giant of lannister but i could explain though not condone it in a situation where shae was really in love with tyrion and feels dumped while in a mere business relationship the idea of what do you want she is whore is a highly discriminatory approach as if a prostitute would be a somewhat morally lesser being sex workers are not more entitled to perjury than any citizen there are hairdressers who have to lie to their clients from time to time psychologists or doctors to name some jobs with close client contact and yet they have no right to perjury at the expense of their clients only because they might lie to them during their worktimeso i could better understand hbo shaes revenge trip if she is more emotionally involved with tyrion than book shae lying so cruelly in court edited by woman of war 21 may 2013  0333 pm"

"lucasd",2013-05-21,"was this supposed to be a list of the worst things that tyrion has done because its not a very damning list1 marillion got his fingers broken by the mountain clans according to the wiki2 arming the vale clans was actually a brilliant act by tyrion it brought them into the war under his command and it helped to keep the vale occupied rather than side with his enemies3 thinking something is funny is not the kind of behavior ill hold against someone people think violent thoughts all the time the only ones i care about are those that act on them4 tyrion drugged cersei to keep her out of the small council calling this a poisoning suggests that tyrion tried to murder her are you talking about this scene or something else5 tommen wasnt kidnapped by anyones definition other than cerseis children get betrothed as part of normal family business tyrion doesnt bear any ill will to tommen and remarks about what a good boy he is his threats to him are also hollow made in hopes of sparing an innocent whore from being tortured by cersei6 tyrion spared sansa from joffreys and cerseis abuse at the cost of his own safety youre suggesting that his treatment of her was grievous it seems to largely be the opposite at great person risk to himself7 i dont recall the antler men someone would have to explain this8 this is typical warfare not something to be admired but also not something to hold over tyrion specifically i believe that barriston remarks about how there is a beast in every man and the atrocities that hes seen in war9 id like to read the scenes where tyrion strikes shae again i dont remember what provoked that or if tyrion was just abusive10 what women issues the reality that he is an ugly dwarf that people look down upon tyrion has a lot of baggage to deal with in that sense i dont hold women issues against anyone until that person starts abusing women and tyrion doesnt strike me as an abuser of women in particular hes an allaround jerk and bully to everyone he insults people regularly unless he takes a liking to someone thats already being bullied and then he bullies the bully most people find that part of tyrion endearing11 dismissing the nights watch is a bit harsh he did talk to his father about helping them tyrion put some effort into getting them resources donated some cash personally and made more of an argument in their behalf than anyone else does in the whole story the only other people i recall helping out the watch at all are ned stark and stannis and ned does no more for the watch than tyrionoverall thats a pretty sad list of things that make tyrion a villain i will readily admit that tyrion is a jerk and a bully but he is a likable character who tends to be on the right side of things hes had some debatable scenes like when he killed tywin and choked shae to death i hold more contempt of tyrion for shooting tywin than for anything else everything that was listed above adds up to morally ambiguous at besti think most of the readers thinks that tyrion is evil from the first book impression where catelyn starts itbasically when we could call ned as lawful good and tyrion is chaotic good at least till his escape yet the deed was clearly manipulated by varysexcluding breaking singers fingers everything he does is usually for greater good but he is not afraid to break the law as nedalso almost everything backfiresjoffrey is so good but the evil hand is making all the miseryfor example antler manthey were traitors and they would die yet by giving them to joffrey he had him occupied not allowing for stupid orders and giving morale to people cersei in the end recall jofrey which almost ends the siege and tyrion goes out to boost morale11 night watch and tyrionhe did everything he could for them at this point given his powerhe ridiculed him in front of the court because it was the only way he could help them given circumstances war and everybody else thinks it is fairy tellsyou can easily say that excluding the north he was the most active player in the watch business"

"WiDMNDBAMMD",2013-05-22,"imagine if it was bronn since lollys hasnt been in the show eekgif classbbcemoticon alteek shae is not marriageable material bronn points this out last episode also bronn is offered a wife that gives him a chance at having a son that would be a lord of a small castle meaning he could become a lord protector if things work out correct for him which they do because cersei is a moronyeah theyre gonna play the psycho jealous bitch card with her arent they sadpng classbbcemoticon alt i guess they already had the ros trying to play her cards to move up in the world and we see how that turned outi dont know how its going to play out i mean if she still tries to be jealous after tyrion doesnt sleep with sansa then i think people will want her to dieill be mad if thats her reason for a betrayali liked it much more when she loved tyrion and cared for sansa and was against the marriage mostly for sansas well being but recognising that tyrion cant do muchtrying to have shaetyrion love deal is just stupid tyrion is suppose to be a smart man he knows that he cannot keep shae a secret in kl forever his father will kill her when she is discovered or worse give her to all his soldiers and parade her naked through the streets tyrions idea in the book of finding her a hedge knight for her to marry or something and live in the city happily ever after was a good ideabut with shae being genuinely in love with tyrion for who he is just makes it impossible for him to give her a happy endingdanerys killed doreah for less and did so in a more gruesome way poor doreah was ordered specifically to seduce xaro xhoan daxos and we dont even know if and how she betrayed danerys she was thrown into an empty cage to starve to deaththere was a horrible deleted scene with doreah being the one that steals danys dragons and kills her handmaiden irri idk if a deleted scene counts as canon or not if they kept it in then everyone would be happy that doreah got put in that vault instead of confusedbut the monologue is horrible just simply horribleheres the linkif hbo can have the very sympathetic dany do that then tyrion can strangle the twotiming whore that plots against him condemns him to death in trial and sleeps with his father while he rots in jaili really dont see how anyones going to have an issue with tyrion killing shae the only issue is making the actual betrayal realisticit makes the betrayal less realistic shae doesnt care about gold or money or anyone else she wants to sail off to pentos with tyrion when she did care about money gold jewels and getting a handsome knight for a husband with a keep for herself in the city the betrayal makes more sensenow i seem to think that somehow varys will hide shae from cersei and shae will go with tyrion to pentos like she has wanted to do for the last two seasons also i expect bronn to possibly go as well lets just keep the whole group together why dont wein the books i didnt think that shae actually betrayed tyrion she lied about their relationship and her background but tyrion was doomed when she testified against him it was just cersei twisting the knife after cersei doesnt give her the things she promised shae she turns to someone or something else which makes her then ends up in tywins bed nakedbronns betrayal is a bit more harsh because bronn actually has a chance to save tyrions life all be it a pretty mountainous task for a reward that is less than what cersei offers himi think its hugely important that bronn doesnt fight for tyrion it shows that theres a limit to what a sellsword will do for the person that theyre in service to and that theres a reason theres no old bold sellswordsi think theres a lot more grey things that dany is starting to do that people are starting to think that shes getting too arrogantmy unsullied brother believes that dany is going to not win because shes getting too corrupted by powerwe dont know whats on bookshaes mind to be honest just because she didnt love tyrion in the same way he loved her doesnt mean she went straight to cersei and told her yes i was tyrions whore ill testify against him if you give me goldshae was detained because she was sansas handmaiden and cersei believed that she knew where sansa stark had disappeared to basically all im trying to say is the queen came to her questioning her so she found out the truth how easily shae ratted her out would probably change how some people feel about her if she holds out for awhile compared to folding quickly we know from cerseis pov that cersei made certain promises which she didnt really care about keeping to a whore and shae was depending on some of those things to get out of the situation in decent shape with her lifethe trial does start a few days after the pw and shaes testimony is on the last day of the three or four day trial so it does take less than a week for shae to turn on tyrion if she never actually cared about tyrion she probably only wanted to get out of there before tywin or cersei found her and killed her didnt she know that they didnt want tyrion to keep her there and take her money and gifts with her yet when they did find her they knew tyrion had one and probably more whores the made her speak against him again not loving someone doesnt make you a bad person and it was her job to make tyrion believe she loved him shes not a sympathetic character but shes not a villain either agreegif classbbcemoticon altagree showshae does seem to care for tyrion unless shes that much a good actress and manipulative why would she ask tyrion to leave westeros if all of his money and consequently her money came from tyrions father and name she just said it to pretend she cares knowing that he would say no shes not that smart and even if she is that would risk her incomes in case he says yes and shes never going to find another patron like himthats the funny thing isnt it shae can find work anywhere though if she keeps her agreement with tyrion to not take another man into her bed then how does she work as a whore she cant tyrion would not be able to find a job across the narrow sea either his money power influence come from his name the only thing he has to offer once you take his name away is his knowledge and wisdomso shae in the show is less a neutral character and she honestly loves tyrion her problem is that shes growing resentful rather than jealous because of their doomed romance hes never going to marry her nor be her husbandis it somehow possible that she believes he is going to love her since the only woman that he ever loved was a whore that was payed to love him i mean this act that shes pulling of trying to be in love with him etc is exhausting but is it all an act from what i remember tyrion cannot get a read on her he doesnt even know where shes fromand she seemed to not understand that tyrion cant say no to his father because without him his name and money tyrion cant survive by himself maybe she deluded herself into thinking that because tyrion was a dwarf and an outcast he would never marry a noble woman so he would choose her instead if she did she had a point until tywin ordered his son to marry sansa who was more a prisoner with only a name but not power by herselfi think the only thing that she might possibly know is that tyrion doesnt have self confidence with girls because hes a dwarf and the only woman that ever loved him he believes is a whore who was payed to love himtyrion points out that sansa is going to have many suitors because of her name alone the fact that shes a beautiful young girl just is icing on the cakethe same fact cannot be said for tyrion though even though by rights he should be heir to castley rock since jaime is lord commander of the kingsguard even margaery tyrell points this out my question is why is no one else tried to offer one of their daughters for castley rocki dont see shae becoming jealous but betrayed thinking that tyrion didnt fight enough for her even when he had no position to do it he did defend her and protect her and in both book and show he tried to help her even after he got married find her a husband in the book and a house in the show shae said not because she felt she was nothing but his whore and the reality is that while they lived in westeros and under tywins rules she couldnt be more than thatbut i dont understand her position it just doesnt make sense to me she wants to leave westeros why doesnt she shes in love with a man that she can never marry she doesnt want to have children with either are we going to assume that tyrion is a better lover than podrick is that the answer we have to go with shae has to realize that theres no future that ends well for her does shae just not believe she can find someone out there that will be as happy with her as tyrion isthat is possible tyrion is one of the few people that will love a whore for who she is because he doesnt believe that theres any woman that could love him for who he is shae is trying to be that girl for him someone that doesnt care if hes rich or a juggler but it seems a little bit unrealistic if shae truly is in love with tyrion not because tyrions a dwarf but because shae is da funny whore"

"JonCon's Red Beard",2013-05-23,"7 i dont recall the antler men someone would have to explain this8 this is typical warfare not something to be admired but also not something to hold over tyrion specifically i believe that barriston remarks about how there is a beast in every man and the atrocities that hes seen in warwe forget often that the game of thrones not only is a game of power its also a game of how we display such powerin book 5 jon makes the decision to kill a man by himself after such man rebelled against him he could have at the end simply made an empty threat and sent him to his duties but he couldnt jon had to kill him to show the others he wont allow more disrespects because hes now their leader and to let them know what fate would have those who opposed him and still see him as a child the kings of the story or the pretenders to the it do pretty much the same they cant only win battles they have to win them by being merciless something that would either discourage enemies or win loyalistsyou know who im talking about and even when there is spoilers on the title just in casebronns betrayal is a bit more harsh because bronn actually has a chance to save tyrions life all be it a pretty mountainous task for a reward that is less than what cersei offers himactually for me bronns situations isnt that bad although sad because bronn is a nice chap i dont remember where the subject of friendship was brought books or show or none but it was always clear in both that bronn worked for tyrion and tyrion paid it their scene during bear and m fair pretty much implies it you pay me to kill your enemies and the sassyness is free something like yes i like to chat with you to hang around but we still have an employeremployee relationship and i wont kill people for you for free again tyrion saw bronn as a friend when at the end bronn was nothing but a close employee of him someone trustable but still paid by him when tyrion asked bronn to be his champion bronn told him hes not his brother which pretty much means i wont die for you that doesnt mean that he wasnt worried though he pretty much seemed to be concerned about tyrionsis it somehow possible that she believes he is going to love her since the only woman that he ever loved was a whore that was payed to love him i mean this act that shes pulling of trying to be in love with him etc is exhausting but is it all an act from what i remember tyrion cannot get a read on her he doesnt even know where shes fromshae wouldnt be the first whore who thought his patron loved her actually there is another example in the books that young girl who had the misfortune to have sex with robert baratheon and have a bastard of his as ned pointed out the girl was in love and was naive enough to think he would return for her and im sure there are way more cases than those two around i dont think showshae was silly enough to fall in love with the men that hired her but in this case she probably realised that there wouldnt be any danger on loving tyrion he was never meant to be married to a highborn lady and he would always have her around to provide him with sex and some tenderness and at some point they might even leave westeros and live as husband and wife but the idea of a real wife someone who might give him love and care would freak her out as she knew one of the reasons he kept her was that no one else would give him that for free shae was replacing the wife he was never meant to have and yet his father got her a pretty nice and innocent wife i would be scared to be sent away too bookshae is a different scenario she didnt care about tyrion nor his marriage not even his life and even if she did care a bit there was nothing she could do testify in his benefit they would kill herthe same fact cannot be said for tyrion though even though by rights he should be heir to castley rock since jaime is lord commander of the kingsguard even margaery tyrell points this out my question is why is no one else tried to offer one of their daughters for castley rockmany reasons one of them they probably want their better daughters for better suitors and not a dwarf that might not even be capable of produce children or hurt their girls and offering the lannisters a second or third daughter would really offend thembut i dont understand her position it just doesnt make sense to me she wants to leave westeros why doesnt she shes in love with a man that she can never marry she doesnt want to have children with either are we going to assume that tyrion is a better lover than podrick is that the answer we have to go with shae has to realize that theres no future that ends well for her does shae just not believe she can find someone out there that will be as happy with her as tyrion iswell the only way they could get marry is if they leave westeros but we know he doesnt want to because he wouldnt be half npi i swear the important man he is under his fathers protection she probably thinks that they would have the same life they have in kl if they travel to any of the free cities and shes wrong tywin lannister would disinherit him as soon as he finds out he married a whore or she thinks he could find a job there wrong again they both would be taken prisoners and she would be whoring again while hes sent to entertain some lord"

"Former Lord of Winterfell",2013-05-24,"i dont see shaes portrayal to date as precluding the chance that shes really a golddigger yes she wants to run off with tyrion she also knows that tyrion is an incredibly bright guy and likely would do very well for himself even if he didnt manage to sneak off with a bunch of lannister gold she also knows that as long as they are in kl the relationship must be kept secret and that it is over if it is ever discovered staying with tyrion in westeros is no guarantee that the gravy train will keep flowing so a calculating shae may well decide that running off with tyrion is a better longterm plan than staying in westeros tyrion of course doesnt want to leave because whatever he thinks about his father he likes the other privileges that come with being a lannister edited by former lord of winterfell 24 may 2013  1203 pm"

"Newstar",2013-05-20,"i missed that still she will ditch the ring she cant wear it after events in early s4 and its not like it has sentimental value to keep eithermaybe she leaves it behind at the pw feast and thats how tyrion in the aftermath of joffreys death realizes shes gone that could workand sansa has no idea her husband isnt attracted to hertv tyrion is attracted to sansa to some extent although he feels guilty about it david benioff said as much on the most recent inside the episode segment which is why he makes a big show of insisting sansas a child claiming he has no desire for her etc etc loyalty to shae had nothing to do with his decision to refuse to consummate the marriage edited by newstar 20 may 2013  0355 pm"

"Arianne Flint",2013-05-20,"wouter  weve seen heart trees before but i highly doubt theyll ever deeply explore any of it old gods or the new very similar to how they mention maesters chains but never what it really represents to the maester to the nonreader it doesnt mean much of anything i think the religions are different enough and dont really have much analogy to current religions that they would have been worth exploring in season 1 but now that were in season 3 and it doesnt get discussed except for some created scenes between melisandre and thoros i dont think were going to get much of anything that will be very satisfying buckwheat  i agree tv shae seems extremely devoted to sansas wellbeing which is something i didnt quite get from her in the books edited by arianne flint 20 may 2013  0402 pm"

"QueenJeyneApproximately",2013-05-20,"it would be more poignant if she does see the goodness in tyrion but shes still unable to let herself be happy because hes a lannister and the lannisters are basically her captors who killed her father and mother and brother if sansa realised that this union could actually be a happy one for her in a world where shes to be given away only for her status and value as a thing it would make it even more tragic the one happiness she could have is also the one she cant allow herself to have and then she loses it all anyway i hope theyre going down this roadi think thats how its portrayed in the book and it seems to be how theyre going to try to do it on the show in the book so many of sansas more nuanced realizations come after the fact for instance she sees the depth of the hounds feelings for her and his potential to be her ally only after hes gone same with tyrion she does come to appreciate him in time but really only when shes at the eyrie in the book i was rooting for her to see tyrions worthor at least realize he could be a powerful allywhile also knowing that such a realization would be tragic a great betrayal of the family shes come to value after they are lost again typical sansa the show cant be as subtle and interior but i think they will show that sansa is conflicted that in one sense she realizes that tyrion is the best of the lot and that at the same time shes truly lost if she becomes a lannister all in all i think the show gets at the same feelings though by different means and at a different pace"
"QueenJeyneApproximately",2013-05-20,"it would be silly to argue against the show making tyrion more likeable and less complex in the show they have and i can understand why  they want someone in each situation who you can root for tyrion is that guy in kings landing they dont want to risk making him more of a morally questionable characteralthough to be honest by this point in the books i really liked tyrion as well i started off disliking him mostly for being a dick but he became much more sympathetic as the books went along by the time asos rolled around i was definitely rooting for tyrion in that general sense i dont see that big of a difference between the show and the booksas for the relationship between sansa and tyrion i thought they handled it well the wedding was awkward enough sansa not kneeling would have come across as pettiness instead of defiance we saw a bit of her defiance and displeasure once they got to the bedroom and she asked what if i never want to i dont think the character development is quite what it is in the books but i think thats impossible a lot of what began to develop sansas character was her inner monologue as she wandered about her prison she didnt really have many people to truly confide in other than dontos who hasnt been a presence in the show the last couple of seasons it would be really difficult to bring that across on tv i think her character development will catch up once she leaves kli agree in both the books and the show he starts off as an amusing but amoral hedonist then becomes something more complex then emerges as a hero a complicated hero but clearly someone we should root for then the pw and its aftermath which gives us a darker tyrion then he becomes winy selfpitying lush tyrion thank god we have a few seasons before that right now were riding the crest of sympatheticunderappreciated tyrion which seems pretty true at this point in the book as well"

"Raksha the Demon",2013-05-21,"i was very much looking forward to this wedding and i was afraid they wouldnt do it the right way since sansa is my favourite character and i have a tendency to dislike big changes from the books emphasize the  and i have to say im pretty happy with how they dealt with it one could easily see sansa didnt want it and one cannot but feel sorry for her while watching the episode well i couldnt her pain was visible the awkwardness was visible the whole sham that the wedding was was portrayed really well especially with drunk tyrion humiliating sansa in the processjoffreys threat served as a reminder that she was still very much a prisoner which was also pointed out by tyrion himself the kneeling well id rather have that they handled the scene a bit different since her not kneeling was quite important in the books but after he asked her to kneel she couldnt do anything else and the awkwardness was already made clear as well as her refusal of accepting the marriagenow i really dont want the show going all sansa accepts and likes tyrion and being all conflicted about it because tyrion is nice to her what i got from the books and this is different for everyone of course she accepted that tyrion was kind to her on multiple occasions but that was about it she did not accept the marriage as a whole she did not accept tyrion as her husband and completely shuts him out as well as any other she does not really like him for being kind to her hes a lannister hes the ugliest guy she could imagine and she would be stuck with him forever hed protect her as good as he could yes but joffrey was still king and she knew itand then the things i read yesterday about how sansa was a shallow little girl and worse things for not liking tyrion lannister more like peter dinklage i think  no matter his good personality or the fact that she shouldnt mind his dwarfism or ugliness because he was kind to her it just shouldnt be criteria for her to like him or even love him the fact that some people do think these are good criteria for loving him and wanting him in her bed i mean really as if i should feel happy as a 13yearold when tyrion lannister is going to be my husband because he is kind while others are not doesnt mean i should instantly or eventually likelove him and be rejoiced love cannot be forced and kindness should not be used as a reason for sansa wanting him in her bed please ive read this so many times yesterday included after people saw the episode and every time it still astonishes mei thought the weddingbedroom scene could have on the whole been far worse i half expected tyrion to be whitewashed far more and behave like a real parfit gentil knight rather than putting his foot in his mouth with his nervous bridetobe by telling her he knows how she feels ie thinking that because he was ordered to marry her as she was ordered to marry him theyre suffering equally when he still has a father and siblings he is not a captive of the family that destroyed his own and is not now facing the obliteration of his own family identity by forced marriage and then getting repulsively drunk during the wedding feast and i thought that smile of tyrions after sansa asks and what if i never want you to was perfect booktyrion accepting but with a savage sarcasm showing however brief tvsansa showed her nervousness and misery with small gestures and posture she looked like a sacrificial offering on her way to her death rather than a bride walking towards her groom when she entered the sept in her finery she threw out a few nervous halfsmiles at the court because it was expected of her and people were actually smiling at her but she looked vulnerable and unhappy of course that rather ugly wedding dress and horrible hairdo didnt help and sansas behavior in the bedroom when tyrion tells her that his father has ordered him to consummate the marriage from her standing there twisting her hands awkwardly to her then mechanically and joylessly starting to strip was in character for the tv version the biggest obstacle in the way of sansa ever becoming anything close to a loving or even content wife of tyrion lannister is not in my opinion his dwarfism its the lack of trust sansa has been hurt so badly by tyrions family that she cannot bring herself to trust him even when he is kind to her i seem to recall dont have the book handy in acok when tyrion rescued her from the beating and had her brought to his tower and treated and he talked to her that sansa was almost tempted to let down her courtesy armor with him but reminded herself that joffrey and cersei had once been kind to her as well or something like that sansa made a huge mistake in trusting the lannisters more than once in got and she cannot forget it and she is hugely wary of anyone in that family even the best of them of course its not easy to tell when one is 1114 who is trustworthy and who isnt and even sansas own father made a fatal mistake in trusting littlefinger and he was old enough to know better"

"Maia",2013-05-22,"in any case the question of who actually inherits casterly rock would only be answered after twyin has died so in legal terms tywins statement that tyrion would never inherit the rock was not ripe to be challenged at that time anywaywell in the books there are allusions by several characters that lords do have legal power to desinherit their children it is just somewhat difficult to make it stick particularly in case of a son imho thats why tywin was careful never to give tyrion any position of responsibility until he had his back against the wall in late agot and condoned public mocking of tyrion by his bannermen which ensured that tyrion would have had precious little support in the west if he ever tried to fight for his inheritance  the western lords clearly didnt see him as a prospective heir and knew that hed have reasons to hold grudges against themi also think that tywins intention not to let tyrion inherit would have been widely understood and supportedanyway it was never clear to me how the practice of killingabandoning dwarf children could be reconciled with the kinslaying tabu not to mention  i am not an expert but is dwarfism usually even noticeable during early infancyand i do think that in the books it was the kinslaying tabu that spared tyrions life early on not any other consideration on tywins partso no i give tywin zero points for not abandoning tyrion or for funding his adulthood because neither has anything to do with a praiseworthy sense of morality or compassionwell i never understood why tywin didnt make tyrion a septon or a maester that would have resolved most of his succesion issues in a socially acceptable way gotten the hated and irritating tyrion out of his hair and likely would have let the family benefit from tyrions talents in the process earlier and without all the drama and again everybody in the realms would have understood why he was doing this and agreed with him i really really hope that wed get some insight on this issue eventually because it it seems so nonsensical from tywins pov not to do this particularly since he must have known from the maesters that there was a decent possibility that some of tyrions children would be dwarfs tooi do completely disagree with the assertion that sansa knew that she was weddable and beddable as soon as she flowered in the books because generally speaking that isnt the case in their society as confirmed by grrm she was at least a couple of years too young for that but joff made a specific threat about bedding her as soon as she flowered which is why she flipped out so badly when she did and tyrion was entirely right to think of her as a child and feel guilty for desiring her"

"Former Lord of Winterfell",2013-05-22,"anyway it was never clear to me how the practice of killingabandoning dwarf children could be reconciled with the kinslaying tabu not to mention  i am not an expert but is dwarfism usually even noticeable during early infancyi think theres a difference between abandoning and actually killing at least in terms of that society if you have a malformed child that you cannot support and leave it to the gods that might be excusable of course not in the case of wealthy nobility but otherwise it may have a certain moral justification in a society where many people are barely surviving but affirmatively killing a child would be kinslaying i thinkwell i never understood why tywin didnt make tyrion a septon or a maesteri know this discussion has been had previously and i guess the answer was that septon or maester is too low a position for a lannister though it still seems like a weak explanation to me honestly i think this one is just explained by grrm wanting him to be an active player rather than internal logic uh as youll see from the way my post ends im having a bit of deja vu right now but i seem to remember george being asked this specific question back at philcon and essentially giving that answer about tywin not thinkin it appropriate for a lannister and then tyrion obviously not being the same character if that was the casei do completely disagree with the assertion that sansa knew that she was weddable and beddable as soon as she flowered in the books because generally speaking that isnt the case in their society as confirmed by grrm well this turned out to be more interesting than i anticipatedso i decided to look this up on the various wikis to see what i could find on westerosi marriage customes finally found something that talked about it which led to a so spake martin entry the entry  which is a verbatim email from grrm himself  says essentially that there are two dividing lines  girlhood to maidenhood which occurs at flowering and then adulthood which occurs at 16 marriages during girlhood are rare and bedding would be considered perversein the general westerosi view well girls may well be wed before their first flowerings for political reasons but it would considered perverse to bed them and such early weddings even without sex remain rare generally weddings are postponed until the bride has passed from girlhood to maidenhood maidens may be wedded and bedded however even there many husbands will wait until the bride is fifteen or sixteen before sleeping with them very young mothers tend to have significantly higher rates of death in childbirth which the maesters will have notedas in the real middle ages highborn girls tend to flower significantly earlier than those of lower birth probably a matter of nutrition as a result they also tend to marry earlier and to bear children earlierhttpwwwwesterosssmentry1050okay so my reading of that is that it is not considered wrong to marry and therefore consummatebed a maid who has flowered but that after the consummation the husband may not routinely sleep with his wife until she is older i think there is some specific textual support for that but i cant recall exactly where sansa also is described as looking tall and womanly for her age so i dont think tyrion being attracted to her would be viewed as perverse in westerosthe so spake martin entry was submitted based on an email a fan sent to george back in 1999 when you could still do that routinely and hed respond and youd then forward them to whomever was administering the board at the time funny that this exact same argument was going on 14 years agoand heres the weird part  that fan email question and response was submitted by me forgot completely about that until i read it aint that some shit cripe youd think id move on from regurgitating the same stuff edited by former lord of winterfell 22 may 2013  1156 am"

"Sansa in the North",2013-05-22,"i think that very much depends on what youre giving up to avoid the beating the cowards course isnt always the bestnot wanting to be beaten doesnt make you a coward eitherbut look the bottom line is one you havent addressed the action you characterize as admirable defiance did not work out that way the lannisters and their guests simply laughed when sansa didnt kneel because it was at tyrions expense rather than theirs even if her intent was to defy the lannisters in some statement of principle which i dont think was her intent anyway it inarguably failed to do that instead the only thing it accomplished was to embarassed the one guy who had been kind to her and make her ashamed of herself for doing in the first place thats not my interpretation  thats what the actual text saysagreed she didnt embarrass the rest of the lannisters only tyrion but it was never her intention to embarrass anyone i think thats why when she saw how humiliated tyrion was she felt shame and knelt to kiss him because sansa is just amazing like that she still hasnt lost her compassion her intent as i see it was to show that she was doing this under duress they could make her marry legally she was a ward of the crown but they couldnt make her kneel and her gesture made this clear she was showing her defiance against the marriage itself she wasnt trying to embarrass anyone and this would not have been accomplished better by refusing to walk to the altar or saying something that would get her beaten because not wanting to get beaten just shows that you have a healthy self preservation instinct sansa acted dignified throughout the ceremony and i admire her for it"
"juanml82",2013-05-22,"people if sansa said no law of men or gods can force me to marry him if i dont want to and i dont want to she would be quietly carried off the sept while someone says the ceremony isnt done yet then shell be quietly hit in all ways and places that wont leave visible bruising until she accepts to get married she was previously hit with an armoured gauntlet several times i think its fair to assume book sansa left kings landing with a few less teeth than the amount she had when she first reached the capitol"

"Jacob17",2013-05-23,"the context has just been completely lost tyrion is not a paragon of virtue because hes a product of his society westeros is a pretty brutal place where things that would be intolerable here are fairly well accepted there cruelty during war swift justicerevenge for perceived slights etc there are a great many ways in which tyrion does not rise above this setting the common listing of his sins  marillions fingers etc  dont seem to many to be outside the norm of what other westerosi would see as something to be expected in those particular circumstanceshowever i think most fans accept those cultural norms as the baseline for judging characters we praise characters who rise above them and condemn those who are even worse tyrion has most of the flaws common to westerosi nobility so those flaws are unremarkable literally  its not really worthy of remarking on them because thats understood as the baseline of the world the author created so its not that tyrion is perfect its that his flaws are unremarkable in the context of the settingtyrion deservedly gets sympathy right off the bat because of the abuse heaped on him simply because of what he is  a dwarf he gets treated like the only black guy in a world full of racists sure his money can buy him temporary friends and pleasures but he is prejudged virtually everywhere he goes and has been considered defective and twisted from birth openly mocked in social settings simply because of an accident of birth people who dont even know him hate him and deride him as the imp and thats completely overlooking the abuse at the hands of his father and sister and the twisted lannister morality in which he was raised that devalued everyone who wasnt a lannistergiven that treatment from virtually all of his peers the fact that he has retained his humanity and in many instances risen above the standards of the day is remarkable the fact that he has retained a sense of humor is remarkable fans like him because of his positive qualities that have been listed previously in particular his demonstrated concern for people to whom he owes nothing bran jon etc when no other member of westerosi nobility would stand up for sansa tyrion did though he had absolutely nothing to gain by it when he had every legal right to take sansas maidenhead secure the marriage and set himself up as a future lord of winterfell and when his peers expected him to do exactly that  he didnt even though he actually had physical urges to do that he resisted them and stopped simply because he thought it was a wrong thing to do to her regardless of what the rest of the court thoughtthat does not make him anything close to perfect but it does make him someone with some very admirable qualitiesyou nailed it edited by jacob17 23 may 2013  1240 am"

foramp160amp160good reason and ends with poisoning cersei really he gave her a laxativei will not go into detail but i could easily rephrase every single point on your list except shae you forgot the singer stewbut there is no point in reinterpreting tyrion is meant to be a morally diversified a socalled grey character thats the point in his character he is not the noble and helpless martyr the victim easy to root for because we can wholeheartedly pity him he is no uncle tom he bites back he tries to keep his head high despite the worst of humiliations he refuses the role of passive victim no he is not meant to make it easy for us readers the poor downtrodden politically correct vertically challenged handicapped an abstract idea of victimhood notyrion is a hugely compelling character a very much complete person more alive than nearly all other characters in the books who happens to be handicapped but is for sure not reduced to that as defining traita challenge meant for readers who dont need easy answersalso tyrion has a pov that is selfpitying he takes things for insults that arent for instance benjen offers him a cloak and tyrion takes it for a slight rather than what it is or when bywater tells him the people hate him because they are starving and his wildlings are rampaging through the city and tyrion ignores these reason and thinks it is because he is a dwarfthere is some truth in it he has experienced the superstitions against him all his lifetime so his first reaction is to see dislike where it usually comes from and not for why it might be justified after a lifetime of despice experiences he in general has not sufficiently learned to distinguish genuine emotions from fake ones and prejudiceswhat she doesnt want to marry any lannister but does think he is better than lancel she has been dragged to the alter being told this man beside her will wed her and rape her despite what she wants she is crying through the ceremony and she knows tyrion wasnt dragged there by guards and knew about it in advance he has been involved in this as much as cersei and joffthis is just not true sansa can know that it was tyrion who protected her when joffrey tortured her and everyone else around did nothing but watchingof course she did not want to be wed that way but after that she could have tried to use the situation to her advantage especially after she knew thattyrion would not rape herthe whole room doesnt care about her loss of happiness and possible freedomexactly people may have been grossed out because she was so young but on principle the same fate being fucked by someone they did not choose had awaited most of the women present and most of the men had raped their young wives people laughing were not all sadists they were children of their timesetting just like those who laughed at tyrion after shaes testimonythe fact that she feels sorry for him when people laugh is a testament to how bloody nice she is if it had been me id have been screaming the whole time laughed along with the congregation and pushed him off dontoss back as soon as i had the chance then again maybe if i was a twelve year old who had seen my father beheaded in front of me and been beaten almost daily for a year anytime i said he wrong thing i wouldntagreegif classbbcemoticon altagree  this is very subjective and in line with what i think my own courage has not yet been tested in a situation like that and seeing a parent murdered like that is the worst imaginable that can happen to a child any of sansas other experiences pale compared to that sansa has done nothing she needs redemption orbeing or staying the holy saint of the story would make her thoroughly boring of course tyrion has made some heroic choices he is the deconstruction of a hero in the books with all his sins flaws and crimes and none of the other potentially heroic characters will be the perfectly recontructed heroic character in the end people often choose to call it redeemed i do not like the religious connotation of it and apart from that no dead child will live stand up and walk because the hero has redeemed himselfall characters will stay flawed no matter what deeds they will have done to save mankind they are human and tyrion is one of the most human with about the biggest presence itn the booksand yes i want to see the dark sides of tyrion in the series

"Mulled Wino",2013-05-23,"i agree with the posters who are saying that sansa doesnt want any lannister and thats the most important thing but also yes she doesnt want him because he is a dwarf so what who would want to marry a noseless dwarf and what the hell is so wrong with her dreaming about handsome lords tyrion himself fantasies about beautiful women all the time and has little time for ugly women such as lollys whom he mocks at least sansa doesnt mock tyrion with statements such as id rather feed it to the goats in fact she tries very hard to find the beauty in him like her septa taught her i doubt tyrion would do the same for lollys why is he allowed to dream and she isnt why is he allowed to want a beautiful woman but she isnt allowed to want a handsome manthe purpose of my arguments about him being a lannister is only to dispel the ridiculous notion that somehow this marriage is just as miserable for tyrion as it is for sansa thats just inarguable she certainly has other reasons and tyrion has reasons to loathe this marriage as well some shallowsome not tyrion hasreasons some shallow some not point being they should never garner similar sympathy nor should anyone expect sansa to come around its not realisticif tyrion says something along the lines of lets take a bkat full of my fathers gold and sail the the jade sea and never se a lannister again i want to love you and blah blah perhaps i could see an argument as to how she might come around but he offers to bring her to casterly rock i feel for tyrion forced to marry someone that will hate him forever but i feel much worse for sansa for being forced to marry her into the family that slaughters hers and holds her captive if tyrion ever inherited the north csn you imagine what northerners would think of sansa shed eclipse theon as the greatest traitor the north has ever known tyrion can still whatever he wants as a man in a married relationship in westeros seems to he able to do"

"Wouter",2013-05-23,"i disagree tyrion was one of the people who put her in that situation he doesnt care about how she feels or that shes crying he probably thinks its alllll because hes a dwarf she has every right to lash out against himindeed in the books tyrion is participating willingly does not even tell sansa in advance that she has to marry him a terribly unkind thing to do to your future bride and he is going into the marriage planning to rape her in the show however tyrion is more clearly ordered himself instead of being persuaded he has the grace to personally tell sansa herself showing respect and he stops the bedding way earlier so i like show tyrions actions way better here and i like it that they also changed sansas attitude somewhat to reflect thati dont mind a whitewashed tyrion it makes it easier to root for the character allthough i generally like book tyrion he acted cruel to sansa until the moment he decided not to go ahead with consommation that sansa was cold to him was well deserved after he had ambushed her along with the rest of the lannisters"
"Minsc",2013-05-23,"regarding the whole cloaking issue within the books as compared to the show there is a subtle action in the show that demonstrates booktyrion lack awareness to her feelings in the led up to the cloaking ceremony simply why didnt booktyrion as someone who knew about the wedding beforehand and likely knows what happens at weddings make any neutral preparations for the cloaking ceremony simply booktyrion could have equally as showtyrion brought with him a stepping chair to the ceremony beforehand thus having that ready to stand on so he could perform the cloaking ceremony thus saving sansa the humiliation of having to kneel and him the humiliation of having to stand on someones back therefore being a neutral unoffensive option for both parties yet for someone reason he decided to negate thinking ahead thus forcing her and him in a stand off where one would have to relent to further humiliation only bad luck for him sansa decided she wasnt going to have any of that thus forcing the humiliation onto tyrion rather then passively accepting it for herself simply if he as a mature adult took any responsible precaution then none of that mess would have happened instead he seems to have just expected that she would passively accept further humiliation rather be defiant to his desires edited by minsc 23 may 2013  0413 pm"

"Former Lord of Winterfell",2013-05-24,"yes this is something i ask myself too why is it so important for those who love the character sansa to emphazise that tyrion treated her badly and not moderately well under these circumstances why is that latter opinion incompatible with loving sansa why could it be a negative approach towards the literary character sansa to see both sides of the coin what does it take away from the character sansa if tyrion is not seen as her antagonistas if you could only defend one character at the expense of the other is this really a zero sum game in quantification of sufferingheres what i think is going on as soon as you start to defend tyrion  or point out that sansa herself seems to recognize his positive qualities  her defenders infer that you are also saying that she should be please to marry tyrion now the thing is that some people here and elsewhere on the internet are making that argument  that sansa is shallow for not appreciating tyrions positive qualities and should be pleased to marry him if only she wasnt an immature twit i think thats what those folks hear when some of us defend tyrionwhat is getting missed is that people like you me and others here are not saying that were saying  if i may speak for our side  that tyrion is a decent guy at this point that sansa recognizes this but that she is nevertheless justified in not wanting to marry him just as tyrion is justified in not wanting to marry her i mean of course she doesnt want to marry him hes perhaps twice her age and ugly as hell even if he was the nicest guy in the world shed still prefer to marry a guy closer to her age better looking who also would be a nice guy and theres not a damn thing wrong with thatbut at the same time tyrion legitimately didnt want this marriage tried to talk his father out of it and accepted it only when he realized his refusal wouldnt benefit either of them tyrions story is incredibly sad to me because despite his wealth all he really ever wanted  and still wants  is the poor little crofters daughter who he thought for a bit loved him for who he was not a fairy tale  just someone poor to love him for himself and then tywin did that its just heartbreaking and i think that event essentially defined who he was moving forward for the rest of his lifeso now tyrion is presented with this situation hes noble enough and considerate enough to argue against it  hes fully considering sansas feelings here in fact her feelings are the very basis for why he speaks against it on both ends he knows she doesnt love him and wont want htis marriage and he doesnt want to be married to someone who feels that way about himthen hes told that no matter what he does shes going to be married off against her will to someone of tywins choosing and tyrion will marry lollys its that fact that determined tyrions acceptance so tyrion thinks to himself that he is not a bad guy that he can protect her that he will be good to her and that shell perhaps actually come to see him for who he is someday we know this because it is one of the first thing he says to her im not joffrey at the ceremony and perhaps there is some truth in that but it is still a sadly romantic bit of optimism hell be lord of winterfell so hell have something too and maybe they can actually have a decent life in timebut as soon as folks start to defend tyrion like that those who are fans of sansa just hear she should want to marry him because hes such a great guy and that simply isnt the case you can see things from his perspective even see things objectively and still acknowledge that there is not a damn thing wrong with her not wanting to marry him edited by former lord of winterfell 24 may 2013  1017 am"

"Sniraga",2013-05-24,"may i just say that this debate has been a very interesting read smilepng classbbcemoticon alt heres my 002i have always felt pity for sansa and tyrion both but sansas position has seemed more miserable to me because of her age and her status as a girl in westeros and as a hostagetyrion did behave quite decently there are many who would have been far more cruel and nonchalant but he has his limitations too i got the impression he was somewhat ashamed of his role in the marriage and didnt really want to think it that was probably the main reason he didnt dare to warn sansa beforehand it was easier not to i get that tyrion was afraid of his father but since that didnt stop him eg with shae i dont buy that as a reason not to talk with sansa to keep the marriage in secret from the bride because it was a matter of state seems like a flimsy copout for me i tend to think he just wanted to apologize and resorted to some excuse that sounded you know neutral and harmlesstyrion clearly understood he wasnt by any means a dream husband to sansa  because he was a dwarf and a lannister  but as he also understood the marriage was quite a good deal for him as far as arranged marriages go and he wouldnt mind the union as much as sansa wouldhe also thought about his ability and willingness to protect sansa and that too weighed in his decision making and its admirable but one of tyrions problems is actually his intelligence hes a lot cleverer than most of people and this has made him somewhat arrogant to tyrion the young and naive sansa must have seemed to be well merely a girl and someone he could and perhaps even should patronize in a more positive sense of the word i guess so while he himself did quickly think the marriage through and tried to take sansas feelings and hopes in consideration he didnt deem it important enough to actually discuss the matter with heri guess this disregard of sansa the person and tyrions own issues with the marriage affected his behavior he was totally unprepared for the cloak exchange and sort of expected sansa to just follow through the marriage ceremony like a good dutiful and polite little girl despite the fact her future plans had just been turned upside down i cant fault sansa for lashing out at tyrion with her refusal to kneel even though the end result was misfired i can understand the need to get even the smallest of victory and to protest by being stubborn and impolite for a moment and i admire sansa for realizing that she was only making tyrion a laughing stock and feeling ashamed of it i must also say that tyrion reacted fairly well i cant say whether his tugging was impolite or not but he didnt make himself a jerk by complaining later that sansa made a fool of him"

"Darth Zyroth",2013-05-24,"i quoted the part of the text where she specifically acknowledged that he was nice to her if you want to quote text from that chapter saying he was never nice to her please feel freei didn<U+0080><U+0099>t say that he was never nice to her he was but he wasn<U+0080><U+0099>t particularly nice or nicer than everybody else during the ceremony ceremony i<U+0080><U+0099>m not talking about the feast or bedding sansa says that no one noticed her tears or just didn<U+0080><U+0099>t care i<U+0080><U+0099>m pretty sure tyrion should have seen her crying but he didn<U+0080><U+0099>t do anything to comfort her later on she says that he wasn<U+0080><U+0099>t smiling at all during the whole wedding he seemed grim and bitter tyrion participated in her marriage he was one of the people who put her in that horrible situation he didn<U+0080><U+0099>t even really try to tell her and gave her a choice where both options seemed bad tyrion or lancel to her and he gave her the choice after joffrey and cersei had told her that she would marry whoever they commanded that was not truly a real choicebecause the ceremony calls for the husband to put the cloak around the wife and i dont think please kneel down because i cant reach is part of the wedding script any more than tugging on her dress is six of one half dozen of the otherneither is <U+0080><U+009C>the bride should kneel for her future lord husband in case he can<U+0080><U+0099>t reach<U+0080><U+009D> sansa mentions that nobody had thought of bringing a stool this means it was fine to use a stool why didn<U+0080><U+0099>t tyrion think about that knowing his height problem and if he went out of the <U+0080><U+009C>rules<U+0080><U+009D> to tug her dress then why not simply askwell you see tugging on her dress as evidence of superiority and i dontwe<U+0080><U+0099>ll just have to disagree here i guess i see it like that because he expected her to kneel for him during her own weddingive been in weddings and similar events where people are supposed to do certain things and if people arent lined up correctly the communication to correct that may just as often be nonverbal as not depending on circusmtances one may be less intrusiveobvious to onlookers well yes but just the fact of kneeling is not an usual part of the ceremony just the fact that she has to kneel will be obvious so why not go ahead and ask instead of tugging her dress and expecting her to do itim saying there is no evidence that the nonverbal communication of tugging on the dress is any worse than verbal communication telling her to kneel neither is part of the wedding script so id cut spur of the moment decisions some slacksure there<U+0080><U+0099>s no evidence but again kneeling is not part of the wedding script either so imo asking would be nicer i<U+0080><U+0099>ve always been told that calling someone is more polite or nicer than pocking that personim not sure how you can know that given she actually states that he was being niceyes she admits he was nice to her in a couple of occasions but what i mean is that she doesn<U+0080><U+0099>t really understand the reason behind his actions sometimes especially while those acts of kindness were happening she thinks he is not kind to her just for being nicedoesnt say that he noticed or was even in a position to noticehe was very close to her during the ceremony i<U+0080><U+0099>m pretty sure he noticedanyway i personally think the way he spoke to her before the ceremony was kind so if you read it differently i dont suppose thats a difference of opinion that can be resolvedi agree that going to talk to her before the ceremony started is nicer than just waiting for her in the wedding but going to her some days before the wedding would have been nicer and the conversation itself wasn<U+0080><U+0099>t really that nice he basically told her with in a better way and with better words what cersei and joffrey had already told her that she would have to marry a lannister no matter whatnot true for example in that same chapter she specifically recalls one of her beatings and thinksit had been the imp who had saved her from a beating that day the same man who was waiting for her now he is not so bad as the rest of them she told herself ill goand when she remembers that he was kind to her it is not accompanied by her thinking is he really being nice to me she was legitimately grateful for itwhat i meant was when some of those acts were happening for exampletyrion turned to sansa my lady i am sorry for your losses truly the gods are cruelsansa could not think of a word to say to him how could he be sorry for her losses was he mocking her it wasnt the gods whod been cruel it was joffreylannister reached out and took her hand and gave it a squeeze i am only a little lion child and i vow i shall not savage you bowing he said but now you must excuse me i have urgent business with queen and councilsansa watched him walk off his body swaying heavily from side to side with every step like something from a grotesquerie he speaks more gently than joffrey she thought but the queen spoke to me gently too hes still

"Blind Beth the Cat Lady",2013-05-24,"yknow with all the people complaining about how the shows portrayal of tyrion makes sansa look bad i think theres actually a big opportunity here to conduct some character development if the show handles it properly so maybe viewers are critical of sansa for not being nicer to tyrion because tyrion is a pretty decent bloke on the show well how about if in the next few episodes prepurple wedding sansa starts changing her mind on tyrion by way of comparison with joffrey in particular  moreso than she did in the books they could do a good job contrasting how the news of the red wedding affects her by showing how joffrey treats her in the wake of that news versus how tyrion does maybe things are just starting to look up when the pw happens and she ends up escaping with littlefinger she certainly has good reason to even if in the show she ends up liking tyrion more than in the books for fear of cersei that would add a nice element of tragedy to what will otherwise be a rather exuberant response to the pw  sansa gets to grow as a character and then just as shes getting to a place where we think she might be able to find at least a certain amount of contentedness in her situation events conspire to take that away from her againi hadnt thought about this possibility before but i like it hope it goes this way"

"Wouter",2013-05-25,"at this point of the story sansa has shown she is a safety risk when she has any important information she has shared critical data twice now and both times it allows people to act ironically those actions are never in her favor i cannot blame the lannisters for not wanting her to know about the wedding any sooner given the clear clandestine planning on the part of the tyrellsi can and do blame the lannisters for dragging a child bride whose family there are at war with to a forced wedding and sansa supposedly not being able to keep important information to herself as tyrion admittedly though but then he never suspected she was about to escape nor knew anyone that she had a kind of secret alliance with the hound is neither here nor there in this case as the lannisters very much did not want sansa herself knowing about it exactly because she would act attempt to escape sooner run to the tyrells kill herself but thats what i was pointing out if tyrion did not want to take sansa against her will but was pressured by tywin to do it allowing herself to act to avoid it should suit tyrion just fine especially if the leak could not be traced back to him as it happened it does not seem like tyrion wanted sansa to find out beforehand as tyrion was unusually willing to respect tywins command and no go behind his backtyrion could have risked it but he most likely would have been burned and hes not that type of self sacrificing characterat that time he wasnt no which is why sansa had little reason to be kind to him later on though tyrion showed that he can be self sacrificing when he rode the pig or was it the dog just to please penny even though he hated doing itactually this marriage was about tywin seizing more territory and had nothing to do with personal humiliation or ridicule or amusement no where does the text give any reason to imply tywin was amused about any of it and instead he continued to pressure tyrion to consummate as quickly as possible and eventually get her pregnant to finalize the situation he wasnt thinking about the starks at allof course he was thinking about the starks he wanted their territory in the north the text stipulates that tywin couldnt bear the thought of tyrion the lecherous imp defiling casterly rock with whores and wild orgies but he obviously didnt mind handing winterfell to him and ned starks daughter to boot after pointing out to tyrion no family of any standing whatsover wanted to give the hand of their daughter to tyrion"
"juanml82",2013-05-25,"well we know willas doesnt hold a grudge based on the fact that he was on great terms with the man who crippled him we also know he loves reading so he is likely to be educated and someone here said he breeds dogs yes he sounds decentand yes the tyrells wanted sansas claim as much as the lannisters but they are more decent people overall they wanted sansa to marry willas so they asked her and she gave her consent you can read them offering her highgarden as cheese in the trap but the fact is that to sansa it represented her escape from kings landing so there was something in it for her sansa knew the tyrells were after her claim and that she was to marry a cripple shed never met before but she was determined to love him and make him love her because he would have been her ticket out of kings landing she would have gained something and to me getting her out of kings landing constitutes as helping her because theres no evidence that the tyrells would have abused sansa she would have been treated with dignity as the future lady of highgarden and she would not have had to endure beatings and live in fear of joffrey so yes the tyrells thought of themselves first in this scheme but they werent completly insincere they also thought of sansa which is more than the lannisters and that includes tyrion ever did but thats just my opinion of courseeta i think the sansawillas match might be more like what the traditional arranged marriage in westeros is like as opposed to the tyrionsansa marriagewell they asked her because they knew shell agree things might have been different if sansa had a reason to refuse themand educated and dog breeder doesnt necessarily imply willas is a decent sort even being in good terms with the red viper might not imply hell be decent to sansa because he might treat fellow knights different than young girls they do paint him like a decent guy and we probably wont get to know much about him anyway but he might be cruel and abusive with those people below his station and might feel women are below his station"

"TNine",2013-05-29,"while tyrion fans are certainly very very guilty of whitewashing his behavior i see a lot ofblackwashing of his behavior especially by sansa fans who seem to want to demonize him as much as possible and perhaps that is the point of tyrions characterto be the grayest of the gray with divisive opinion look at how he acts in regards with tysha and sansa with the rape incidents saying he freely raped tysha or that he shouldnt get credit because he didnt rape sansa is a vast oversimplification of the situation in both situation he is faced with serious incentive to carry through with the action including not having to face social stigma and serious threats if he does not carry through i mean look at tyshas situation a thirteenyearold faced with his father staring him down and a battalion of guards around with the orders of do it or pay the consequences from a man who once eviscerated two entire houses and coupled with that was the fact that he believed tysha was nothing more than a whore in for the money could you have said no i doubt i would have that kind of strength and again with sansa he faced serious ridicule and pressure from his family and society itself while receiving almost nothing from sansa and yet he stops himself from following through with the action since he believes in doing the right thing does that make him a great character on par with ned stark no is it ludicrous to use those actions as evidence to frame tyrion in as dark a way as possible yes he deserves credit for what he does right and criticism for what he does wrong but hes pretty firmly in the middle ground keep in mind that i like sansa far more than i like tyrion but you cant cherrypick incidents and use that as proof for what a character really is like"

"Rapsie",2013-05-30,"i myself am very critical of his behaviour in this marriage because i felt betrayed by tyrions character like many people i had thought tyrion was a morally good guy and glossed over his misdeeds up until that point agree completely i was certain he would tell her as soon as they got o the bedroom that he was there to protect her and instead we got the awful knight of flowers and attempted rape but isnt this what makes good writing the characters do the unexpected they may act irrationally make mistakes do not consider all circumstances act spontaneously under uncertainty  and yes sometimes they surprise us readers with moves we would never have expected from them and do not like should we then withdraw our favour like a sulking kid taking this as personal betrayal of our fan loyalty no one is denying tyrion is a well written or engaging character it is those that continually whitewash him because they cant stand liking a villainous  antihero or grey character that are the problem you can still like a character but admit they are on a dark path its when you have a character like tyrion that some people like so much that they over emphasis their favour and like someone supporting a freedom fighter who has become a tyrant fail to acknowledge any possibility that their favourite is no longer the amazing hero they thoughts they were and instead make excuses for every action they make to explain how its not their faultbeing part of the forced marriage made him start to dislike tyrion but i still enjoyed his chapters even his adwd ones it was only on a reread and the tyrion reread where it became clear that he had been a bitter mead spirited selfpitying person from the start of the series but that had been hidden as his nicer traits had been emphasised and on the first read through you take everything he says as gospel and do not realise he is an unreliable narrator he is still a funny character thoughits fine to like tyrion i like victarion but im not going to justify him killing his wife to whitewash him or to suggest that stannis burning people alive is okay it puts stannis on to a severely antihero category and for some people that makes him a villain along with renlys death the biggest sin a literary character can commit is being boringwell the damphair wins that award imho but tvs whitewashed tyrion is certainly winning it for the series as he has become even less flawed than ned on unsullied forums he is being referred to as a true hero with all the attributes of one to be honest given the characterisation so fari think they are going to struggle to make him believably kill shae unless they go out of their way to make everyone else look so bad that he is justified in his actions although given they have changed the plot and mangled characters to do that this season as they have had to do with everyone surrounding robb because of the talisa change they may well continue and next season we will find out shae will be torturing kittens for fun with her new bf joffthe more people fight about who was terrible to whom in the marriage and which character is more flawedsympatheticterribleawesome the more i ship for sansa and tyrion to end up as a shockingly happy power couple each content that the other has a beloved paramour on the side ruling some unburned corner of westeros with wit and poisesadly i think you are right sansa deserves a happy ending but sadly she will not get it instead she will no doubt be made into the loving trophy wife of tyrion of the titanium plot armour edited by rapsie 30 may 2013  0243 am"

"Cas Stark",2013-05-30,"yup tbh tyrions true nature is a selfish one hes spent his entire life watching out for himself because nobody else really has  the best hes ever been given at most is indifference rather than true protection  so the lesson hes learned is that tyrion is for tyrion to quote one of my other favorite books the last battle the dwarfs are for the dwarfs he does have unselfish impulses from time to time usually attached to cripples bastards and broken things  and sansa qualifies as a broken thing considering how much shes been through thus i think why he does the unselfish thing by not forcing a consummation  but in the end it cycles back to tyrion watching out for tyrion and having the lannister name is part of how he watches out for himself i dont think i can ever see him abandoning itwhile i was certainly surprised at tyrions murder of his father i cant say i was wholly upset i think thats actually part of where a divisive line lies  how can you be troubled by the fact that tyrion actually murdered one of the villains of the story whose death you totally wanted to happen its a tough line to walk while i was cheering at the fact that it happened i was genuinely troubled by the fact that tyrion had done such a thing  because it wasnt for a heroic reason it was due to him basically having a psychotic break due to what had happened with shaesoo do i think tywin and shae deserved to die yes most certainly in such a way not really at tyrions hands it was not a moral choice it was revenge and hardcore hatred pure and simple and again selfmotivated he was wounded to his core and acted out on it instead of thinking about it  and thinking is imnsho tyrions true strength and the only thing that saves him from being a dark character smilepng classbbcemoticon alt  i think were in the same place here it doesnt make him heroic just is a nod to the fact that yeah tyrion can do somewhat the right thing sometimes winkpng classbbcemoticon alt yes very close to the same placetywin lannister definitely deserved death but not at the hands of his son and not in that circumstance for such a random in the moment reason the same goes for book shae she was a pos no morals cared for no one but herself but tyrion doesnt really kill her for those reasons in my opinion nor does he really kill her because she betrayed him in the trial but because he snaps at the full realization that she never cared for him one bit ever at all and that is not a reason to kill someone no matter what kind of worthless pos they are but many disagree on that"

"Woman of War",2013-05-30,"yes exactly as her husband he is her guardian and it is guaranteed that she cannot be used anymore by another house for grabbing the north so maybe maybe tywin would have let them go but tywin would never have forgiven tyrion to wring sansa out of lannister power apart from that nobody at kl knew that jaime had been freed and sansa was in theory still the guarantee for his safety though by being married and destined to make babies she had become quite untouchable as hostage there was no way anymore for tywin to kill her off as hostage  only the starks may not have been aware of it and for tyrion jaimes safety had always been of huge importance so slipping sansa out not knowing what this meant for jaime and sansa is not the person who can travel light clad as commoner wrapped up as young man riding all day long looking after herself with maybe two plain unremarkable guards she would need a huge staff for amenities and protection the preparation would draw attention and make the smuggling out a high risk enterprise even if sansa could have kept her mouth shut and where to take her a high maintenance girl right through the war edited by woman of war 30 may 2013  0118 pm"

"Newstar",2013-06-02,"but the two scenes arent even in the same galaxy in terms of how silly and naive they make sansa lookin your opinion id say theyre about roughly the same in how they make sansa look book sansa had no notion the tyrells were interested in her for her claim until someone else pointed it out to her and even then she pretty much put itand the implication that the tyrells were hoping to claim winterfell over her brothers dead bodyout of her mind in favour of fantasies about puppies and barges and how willas would love her when he saw her in her pretty dress until cerseis revelation that she was to marry tyrion snapped her out of it book sansa thinking the tyrells were interested in her hand in marriage for nonpolitical reasons until someone tells her otherwise was about on par with tv sansa innocently wondering if her family would be invited to the wedding in my opinion in terms of making sansa look extremely silly and naive caught up in romantic fantasies and ignorant of political realities is a sansa who hopes that her family might be permitted to attend a highgarden wedding any different from a sansa who has absolutely no notion that the tyrells are only interested in marrying her for political reasons until someone tells her otherwise and who wonders what would willas want with winterfell when he has highgarden i dont think so different scenes same sansamaybe her focusing on the pretty dress and imagining her life in highgarden is her way of protecting herself against thinking about the fact her her brother has to die for her claim to winterfellthats just fanwanking or headcanon though theres nothing in the show to suggest that tv sansa has any problem with a political marriage or with loras and tyrions families counting on robb dying to access her claim shes thrilled at marrying loras after all she objects to the marriage to tyrion first and foremost because as she tells margaery in 3x07 tyrions a lannister but when margaery mentions what her child from the marriage might be able to claim sansas disgust is not at the lannisters accessing the north but at having to have sex with tyrion to produce a child it would have been very easy for the writers to include a line here or there to make it absolutely clear that sansa was reluctant to be married off for her claim as she was in the books even if she was willing to marry willas for other reasons they did noti personally think the overall show portrayal is very fair perhaps leaning towards more favorable to sansatv sansa actually showed one instance of being smarter than her book self under similar circumstances book sansa told dontos all about the plan to marry willas which is of course what tipped off littlefinger and then thinks that shed told dontos but he didnt count ugh sansa sometimes i swear to god when tv sansa told littlefinger that she wished to remain in kl on the other hand as opposed to going with him she made up a reason why and refused to disclose the true reason the marriage to loras very very smart of course littlefinger already knew the truth because loras was a blabbermouth and its possible he chose to blow the whistle on the loras match not only to satisfy cersei but also out of spite that she had refused his offer of escape in favour of marriage to another guy but that was impressive you might also say that tv sansa seems to understand and accept the idea that shell have to enter into a political marriage she has a nonreaction to margaery talking about the political benefits of her marriage to tyrion except to get upset at the idea of having sex with tyrion whereas book sansa didnt seem to grasp that until it was pointed out to her so that shows a level of maturity and understanding about the nature of marriage that book sansa doesnt have at this stagein general though i think that the tv series doesnt dumb down sansa rather it highlights how silly and naive book sansa is at this juncture if tv sansa doesnt grow a brain when we get into the postlysa vale storyline and fails to make any deductions of her own while hanging on littlefingers every word then fair enough but i think shes just about where she needs to be in the show in terms of savvy edited by newstar 02 june 2013  1228 pm"

"Newstar",2013-06-02,"that naive and immature fantasy involved her being active in trying to escape much earlier than the book version the result being that shes been rendered almost totally passive in the narrativewell the only reason she was trying to escape much earlier in the book version is that the opportunity was presented to her much earlier in acok in the show she only got her first offer of escape in 2x09which she quite sensibly declinedand her first offer of escape from littlefinger in 2x10 its a time delay nothing more and remember that in 3x01 sansa was the one who reminded littlefinger of his previous promise to aid her she wasnt just trotting off to the godswood on a mysterious note and following instructions shes independently on her own initiative broaching a treasonous subject with littlefinger with her handmaiden and littlefingers assistant barely out of earshot i suppose if she were being really active she would have sought out littlefinger in the show without waiting for him to come to her but if anything its even more active than in the books really though as ive said if you took book sansa and put her in tv sansas circumstances youd probably get the same actions edited by newstar 02 june 2013  0715 pm"

"Thor Odinson",2013-05-20,"im just throwing this out there but its possible for coldhands to appear without being cast yet if you watch the walking dead michonnes first appearance in the season finale before last was a brief cameo with a different actress filling in she wasnt cast until the following season so as long as coldhands makes a brief nonspeaking appearance then theres no need to cast him until next season as anybody can wear the costume to make a brief nonspeaking appearance"
"Tall Tyrion Lannister!",2013-05-20,"i think this is very possible have sam show up and meet bran tell him about the passage and how someone is waiting on the other side finishing the episode with bran crawling or whatever through the darkness  revealing him to viewers since the samcoldhands interaction is likely off screens4 opens up with him coming up on the other side and coldhands welcoming the group which is now minus osharickon since she vowed not to cross the wallslight change to your scene have sam say theres someone to meet him on the other side of the wal rickon and osha split from the rest and go to where ever then bran goes through the door we see or hear a bunch of ravens bran looks around and sees coldhandsyou dont even really need to cast a actor to play the role it could be a extra like beric was the first season"

"chris999",2013-05-21,"im anticipating that were going to meet coldhands in the coming episode assuming they havent cut him altogether which would be a whole other thing as far as im aware there are two major theories on who coldhands is one is that he is the nights king a lord commander during the age of heroes who supposedly to an other to wife and began to rule the nights watch like a king until being put down by both the king in the north and the king beyond the wall the other is that he is in fact benjen starkalthough i am personally open to both theories this post assumes that coldhands is in fact jons uncle lost beyond the wall if so this will have posed something of a problem for the writers we already know what benjen looks like they could through a cloth over most of his face true but the viewers probably havent forgotten benjen completely and may still recognise his voicethe writers may have encountered a similar problem this season with astranbarristan but given that the readers at least knew who astran really was decided to chop the knot and reveal his true identity immediately for obvious reasons they cant do this with benjenunless its done carefully either one of the two major theories mentioned above will be ruled out for the readershipthoughtsi am one of the few that thinks that coldhands is just coldhandsi really dont think there is anything special about him other than that the three eyed crow can manipulatewarg himi am not certain if benjen is dead or not but i actually think that benjen could turn out to be the nightsking old nan puts an emphasis on the original nightsking possibly being a stark and i think that the reason that benjen has not been found yet is because he is way deeper in the north than anybody else and he may even be with the others by now for all we know e havent herd from him since the damn others appeared to begin with"

"The Killer Snark",2013-05-20,"agreed with the other supporters here changing the coloured hair and beard makes little difference the characters in essos in the series lack the weird hair colours and wacky hair and beards in the novels anyway the purpose was only to bring in a character dany could realistically have a sexual fixation on who comes across exactly like he does in the books even the body movements are the same of course they could have made him just as ostentatiously dressed and hes a good actor who appears to have an understanding of the books also book daario actually is an arrogant douchebag its just that he has charm edited by the killer snark 20 may 2013  0123 pm"

"Knight of Dubious Honor",2013-05-23,"greetings first time poster here ive skimmed through this thread and found it suprising that the one scene from the last episode which in my opinion helped bring stannis back on the right track is used as an example of this characters assasination let me preface by saying that personally i also believe that stannis baratheon looses a lot of depth in the tv show compared to the books and that the showrunners struggle with this character since season 2 however the scene between him and davos from the last episode was probably one of the best characterisation of stannis in this show and a scene that finally brought glipmse of the character from the books the main problem with tvstannis so far was the way showrunners presented him which made him look almost like another villain not like the conflicted man who was brought into his position by forces he couldnt control or fight but like just another asshole who wanted the throne becouse it was his birthright its not that weiss or bennioff wrote him in a way that conflicted with the book version no its just that the specific bits and pieces of him that they decided to show were almost all negative they always shown only his angry stern demanding side for those who didnt read the books this could paint a picture of stannis that was rather negative but here in this scene we finally got a glimpse of stannis that suggests to the viewer his true motvations stannis that didn pursue the crown becouse he wanted to rule and felt cheated but stannis that was tricked into believing it was necessary not only that but we were also presented his doubting and compassionate side by showing him trying to find a reason to save the boy now someone could argue that he sure as hell didnt seem to fight mellisandre strong enough they could argue that it was strange for stannis to say just get on with it when he first talked about the red witch plans after all in the books he wrestled with the decision to burn edric almost half the novel but that wouldnt work in the show couse for all the scences of stannis acting stern in the previous season his character still hasnt been properly established there just wasnt enough screen time in the books we could have stannis wrestle with the decision for so long becouse up to that point we had several hundred pages worth of stannis acting like a stern douche with a stick up his ass so it all balanced itself out winkpng classbbcemoticon alt  if they did that in the show however the sudden change from supposedly unforgiving uncaring stannis that they wanted to build over the last season would be to jarring instead the showrunners navigated this situation rather gracefully by making him say just get on with it as soon as he learned of what mellisandre wanted to do with the boy they showed the typical stern side of stannis baratheon who didnt want to waste time by questioning and pondering the harsh truths that were unavoidable and necessary but at the same time by pitting him against davos in that scene they showed that theres more to the man than meets the eye there wasnt any big literall demonstration of compassion no that would be too much that would be uncharacteristic instread we got the brooding yet still not totally lost to human compassion stannis by showing him looking for davos as possible sneaky means of avoiding the inevitable they showed the true stannis  a man that is resigned to the inevitable fate and who wont defy the red witch but who at the same time is searching for reasons and methods to blunt the edge of all the things she makes him do which is perfect the showrunners had their cake and ate it too in that moment also the more i watch stephen dillane act the more i am in love with his potrayal the showrunners handling of stannis might not have been perfect up to this point but dillanes performance is just great for stannis that highly tense growling guttural acting combining intensivity with revserve and emotional restraint and sprinkling it all with that strange awkwardness he has when talking about the things he doesnt want edited by knight of dubious honor 23 may 2013  0445 pm"

"Nezzer",2013-05-24,"and i am sure davos will spirit gendry away as he did with edric storm in the books hmmmi wonder if he will run into arya wherever he goesim starting to think it will be stannis himself that will send gendry away instead of davos probably after being persuaded by davos in the synopsis for episode 10 it says in dragonstone mercy comes from strange quarters and stannis is known by all the other characters for being utterly without mercy that might make stannis much more sympathetic i dont want to see him threatening to kill davos like in the books the sooner he becomes likeable the better happypng classbbcemoticon alt "

"ServantOnIce",2013-05-25,"i am a member of team stannis and thought he was too rigid in the books i want to be king because i am supposed to be the king thats the way it is he was too stubborn until the wall thing happened and adwd then i realized there is goodness in king stannis"
"Toxspecific",2013-05-26,"he was certainly somewhat too pissed off and stubborn preblackwater but unlike a common perception he didnt fight the battle badly remember that he wouldve won it if not for tywin bringing in a last minute miracle after that he became more flexible in matters where he did not need to contradict his principles and developed as a leader something neither robb joffrey balon and dany did not do i dont necessarily desire for him to become king at all costs if in any way it lessens the quality of the series then i sure as hell dont want him to become king and this is the difference i find between myself and other stanstans and other fandoms we dont put the character above the series at least i dont and i find this indirectly making me think hes more awesome i saw a signature in some users post something about the realm needing stannis as a protector but not a king like a dark horse as the sig said sounded cool and i agree with about half of it"

"Arbor Gold I'm Sold",2013-05-27,"stannis never thought of going to the wall and saving the realm how many people did stannis ever send to the wall from dragonstone he was a powerful lord surely there must be instances throughout the books of men of the nights watch from dragonstone right it took the onion knight to actually get through to stannis that hey maybe you could actually do the right thing and maybe that will help your cause"
"bobbybuilderton",2013-05-27,"its been made clear that his desire is not power its to do his duty his duty happens to be serving in a position of power since he was supposed to be second in line i dont have anything to say as far as stannis being good or bad but it kind of irks me when people project greed and ambition onto him think what you want about the things he does but he very clearly is doing them because he thinks its his responsibility to and hes stubborn not because he has some huge overwhelming thirst for power  if he wasnt rightfully second in line and he didnt have melisandre telling him he is some foretold hero i highly doubt he would be doing any of this once again no comment on if his actions are right or wrong just that i wish people would get his intentions straight edited by bobbybuilderton 27 may 2013  0111 pm"

"Lord Varys",2013-05-30,"i think the stannisdavos scene actually showed something the books did not yet show as well as the show the reason why stannis turns to davos when he does in the books the impression is created that stannis is actually somewhere in the middle between davos and melisandre and needs to be swayed in this or that direction its also indicated that he may not be aware what kind of people are surrounding him ie axell florent or clayton suggs but thats not the case stannis is a good judge of character and he pretty much knows what davos selyse melisandre axell justin massey or clayton suggs are going to tell him before they do the fact that stannis goes to davos shows that he himself has doubts about melisandres plans he does not really need davos to tell him what to do he knows that well enough"

"ChromeWeasel",2013-05-20,"the problem for me was that the whole set up was so convoluted to set up a nude scene why was stannis worried about gendry why were they even considering sacrificing him when the leeches are so effective why not get more than 3 leechesif i recall correctly from the books the leeches came from stannis the kings were killed then mel went after edric i just keep asking myself why the scene with davos and stannis when gendry was only to be leeched i suppose the implication was that stannis got mel to change her mind oh wellyouve got it backwards melissandre wants to a full kingsblood sacrifice stannis doesnt like the idea but hes considering it davos talks mostly talks stannis out of it melissandre then offersaccepts that she will provide proof of the potency of kings blood so she leeches gendry when the usurpers end up dead mel will have proven her ability to stannis and davos then she will be allowed to sacrifice gendry properly"

"Head of The Ned",2013-05-22,"i dont see why people are up in arms about gendry being afraid of the leeches i think it was more the combination of being bound by hand and foot after thinking you were going to nut inside a hot ass melisandre only to have her put some slimy leeches on you and your cock at full mast not exactly a good feeling am i right gents especially for your first time getting it incause show mance is too old lol i dont really like this plot deviation too much but if i had to guess id guess he ends up back in the riverlands with brienne and the bwd becasue unless they turn the stannis plotline into another love triangle gendry has nothing to do for a long long time plot wiseno because show mance hasnt made it clear yet that he infiltrated winterfell previously but then again we know very little about mance in the show gendry is one of few people in westeros who knows what arya stark looks like edited by head of the ned 22 may 2013  0846 pm"

"LilJonUmber",2013-05-26,"i didnt know that being a healthy male stimulated by obvious attractive sexual stimulus made you a sheep acting irrationally on them would get you closer to an animal but enjoying it in a different degree makes you a sheep i dont think you used the term correctly there sheep are those who parrot the opinion they are told to parrot when it comes to all kind of topics including sex and nudityweve also seen male nudity including jaime robb and gendry who happen to rank among the most attractive male characters for the horny sheep female audience or how would you talk about those girls who tweet about their asses and the almostwhatwesawofgendryi dont deny that got has some eyerolling sex scenes that were not needed like in example ros and the other prostitute while lf talked about cat or even theons threesometorture because even if it had a point it went on for too long and too explicit but some of them including gendry and mel are actually good and needed the exotic charming priestess from the east used flesh and luxury to trap the poor boynudity  mental and physical vulnerability robb with talisa jaime with brienne mel with gendry strong characters naked in front of others strong characters in a more vulnerable real or simulated statei understand your reasoning about the stripping down of characters  literally and figuratively the psychology behind it makes a ton of sense though i suspect that youve put more thought into the inclusions of these scenes than those who actually put them therenow i dont want to break down every single scene and put an agree or disagree next to it along with my reasoning so lets just say that the usage of female and male skin has been shameless and shameful tbh i dont have any moral opposition or uptightness to the inclusion of such and if you went back a few pages or so youd see that my main gripe is that almost none of these scenes are in the book and if you add up their collective run time theyve probably replaced about an episodes worth of potential book material thatd be more useful and less divisive to all  readers and unsulliedthat more than anything is what causes these eyes o mine to start rollin when i see these scenes not a my poor widdle virgin eyes blanket aversion to them btw the sheep analogy was in reference to those who blindly follow wherever theyre led offering littletono resistance  ie wherever the show takes the audience some will follow without question edited by liljonumber 26 may 2013  0937 am"

"cybobbie",2013-05-19,"like many i was upset with sansa kneeling but by now im more ok with the changesadaptations than i was in previous seasons and considering how they are portraying tyrion in the show it wasnt a total shock i also didnt like much the open treat that cersey made to marg i mean i think that telling the rains of castemeere story was enough treat and more subtle so they should stop there finally the sex scene between gendry and melisandre wasnt that necessary imo"

"congokong",2013-05-19,"while i did like the show finally explaining the significance of the rains of castamere what really bothered me was cerseis threat to margery and basically saying we will never be family to her way to burn bridges cersei in this case its the bridge leading to highgarden normally she has been whitewashed into an almost likable character but dd all of a sudden took a uturn and made her worse then she as even in affc even in that book she tried to hide her dislike for margerythey really exceeded their booty quota this week melisandre fucks gendry and then binds him and puts the leeches on him all because she wanted his guard down it felt like a milf torture porn fantasy they seriously could have used the leeches without the whole sexual debaclestannis character in the show has always been awful and this episode was no different hes a man of duty and honor and would never just shrug at the murder of an innocent bastard or noi get sick of all the raunchy dialogue in the daenerys scenes and all the others in fact if you are going to remove parts of asos take out the sex talk certainly dont add to it while removing things that actually advance the plotoverall a better episode than last as a purist it will never be as good as the first season again i wager"
"Pinkie Baelish",2013-05-19,"sam the slayer was great but i think its come too late we still have coldhands and the nightfort left for the season if they had done sam the slayer in the first or second episode it would have somewhat made up for the lack of the battle of the fist the scene was brilliantly executed overall but my minor gripe is that i would prefer if sam killed the ww in front of grenn rather than have the cliched nerdyguysavescrushfrommonster thing but i guess it fleshes out gilly and sams relationship more and may explain why she falls for him"

"mafalda",2013-05-20,"i like a sex scene as much as the next person but wtf with the orgy on dragonstone why was it necessary for them to have sex unless she just purely wanted to tap that which is gross because gendry is still a kid in my mind just like in the books older than arya but still a kid practically and mel is goodness knows how old not saying she looks old because she looks great but who knows what kind of magic she works to keep herself looking like that then stannis and davos just waltzed in without knocking and watched the whole scene was dumb this scene and the two fisting whores from s1 are the worst sex scenes and where the fuck is robb and cat theyve been totally pushed aside this season last episode poor cat only got half a line before ignorant blackfish cut her off to talk about wet shit dumbest thing ever and who knows before that the only dialogue i can really remember from her is that stupid monologue about jon with talisa she is a pov character whos been reduced to one line every other ep i hate talisa now more than ever because time that could be spent on cat is spent on her naked ass writing letters and shit"

here and your uncles bloody wedding or in the previous episode jaimes line sure sorry for the sapphires was good but itll never be even near as good as good i only rescue maidens im expecting the hounds little speech about knights in the upcoming episodes if not ill be really really pissed and disappointed why do the second sons start speaking in the common tongue when they go into the tent they are in yunkai not in westeros why don<U+0080><U+0099>t they start speaking valyrian and then dany asks them to speak in the common tongue the same thing happened in the last episode it really bothers me iirc grey worm can<U+0080><U+0099>t speak the common tongue of westeros every time he speaks he speaks in valyrian and dany replies to him in valyrian as well so how the hell did he understand what mero was saying and asked dany if he should cut out his tongue later when they are alone the sellswords are speaking with each other in the common tongue of westeros why not in valyrian they live in yunkai and i already said this but i<U+0080><U+0099>ll say it again neither mero nor daario have a braavosi and tyroshi accent respectively why isn<U+0080><U+0099>t there someone guarding dany<U+0080><U+0099>s tent how can it be so easy for someone to get in daario is not enough arrogant selfcentered and without reservations he is too<U+0080>nice cersei so openly threatening margaery she makes mistakes and some stupid things but she is not that stupid i didn<U+0080><U+0099>t like that they changed the story of the rains of castamere like that cersei had already been born when the reynes rebelled against tywin instead of tytos and she said tywin hanged the corpses in casterly rock all summer all summer so for like seven years makes no sense<U+0080><U+0080> i<U+0080><U+0099>m soooooo over the queen of thornes enough already i cannot stand her shes so annoying i can<U+0080><U+0099>t wait for margaery and tommen to get married so she can go back to the reach unless the producers love her so much that decide she<U+0080><U+0099>ll stay and help margaery scheme against cersei oh wait<U+0080><U+0080><U+0080> i wanted a dancing scene during the wedding no wedding is a wedding without dancing gilly doesn<U+0080><U+0099>t mention that the wildlings only get a name when they are two years old i<U+0080><U+0099>ll be waiting for her to say it in the next episodes no coldhands cryinggif classbbcemoticon altcrying  although he can still appear so we<U+0080><U+0099>ll see<U+0080><U+0080> puddles became shards cryinggif classbbcemoticon altcrying  sam

should must has to know how to make a fire stannis doesn<U+0080><U+0099>t show any internal conflict when delivering his lines he even has an arrogant smile even when davos is talking davos doesn<U+0080><U+0099>t believe in any gods well since in season 2 he doesn<U+0080><U+0099>t give a shit about the seven burning i guess it<U+0080><U+0099>s<U+0080>ok<U+0080><U+0080>and where is his famous line <U+0080><U+009C>everything<U+0080><U+009D> the whole melisandregendry scene was just terrible it makes no sense at all to me mel wants to burn gendry according to the conversation between davos and stannis but then davos convinces stannis of not doing it so she decides not to do it so instead she is going to leech him but is the sex part necessary to leech him and does she have to tie him to leech him she can just ask him to put the leeches i<U+0080><U+0099>m sure it<U+0080><U+0099>s not a big deal and why does she have to penisleech him he has blood all over his body but if the blood is stronger in his cock and has to be from there then why not put the three down there why only one and if she is going to have sex with him then why not just make a shadow baby instead of leeching him and then ask davos to take her to king<U+0080><U+0099>s landing since is too easy especially for her to get very very near to the red keep just makes not fucking sense at all<U+0080><U+0080> i felt like the wedding was more centered in tyrion<U+0080><U+0099>s misery than in sansa<U+0080><U+0099>s tyrion<U+0080><U+0099>s line <U+0080><U+009C>and so my watch begins<U+0080><U+009D> that makes no freaking sense the oath of the night<U+0080><U+0099>s watch is not only about chastity it<U+0080><U+0099>s about taking no wife holding no lands fathering no children wearing no crowns and wining no glory it<U+0080><U+0099>s about giving your life to the realm but he is married so it doesn<U+0080><U+0099>t apply and makes no sense why not keep his <U+0080><U+009C>never<U+0080><U+009D> <U+0080><U+009C>why that is why the gods made whores for imps like me<U+0080><U+009D> it shows some of his pain and his vices no robb and no cat the rw has had a terrible building up although not robb and cat may actually be a good thing that way we don<U+0080><U+0099>t have to watch that complete disaster and mess of storyline and i can say <U+0080><U+009C>i

"Darth Zyroth",2013-05-22,"i understand completely that this is a tv adaptation and i went in from the beginning knowing very well that things would be changed i watch each episode with an open mind and when one of my favorite parts makes it in im pleasantly surprised most of the people on this board seems to have went in from a completely opposite point of view instead of staying open they focus in on the things missing and then act like this is the worst adaptation ever because some random guardsman was drinking arbor ale instead of arbor gold many of us have very high expectations we expect an outstanding adaptation of one of the best series ever written and when we dont get that we feel very disappointed excuse us for thatthis thread is for nitpicking ranting and venting about whatever people want you can debate the accuracy of their complaint ie i cant believe rickon hasnt appeared this season but the its an adaptation its not the books comment is not valid here and many people here actually have valid criticism not just that daario doesnt have blue hair of course you would know that if you actually read all the posts instead of just calling us whiners and book puristsdo you see me in the positive nitpicking thread saying what i hate about the show no i say what i loved do you see me there telling people they cannot love something just because i disagree no i dont agree with some of the comments there but i dont say anything do you see me there saying that the should be more critical instead of loving everything no do you see me there telling people what they cannot love no then why some people come here telling us what we cannot hate just because they disagree and they loved thatto be honest i wouldnt watch the show at all if i had their mind frame its like a religious group watching shows like family guy or south park just so they can blog about it after lifes too short to spend it doing things that you obviously hatebut we dont hate the show why cant someone enjoy something but still have some complaints about it who said someone cant love and enjoy something but still be critical about it why cant we both love and hate the show whyup and down meera would sigh sometimes as they walked then down and up then up and down again i hate these stupid mountains of yours prince branyesterday you said you loved themoh i do my lord father told me about mountains but i never saw one till now i love them more than i can saybran made a face at her but you just said you hated themwhy cant it be both meera reached up to pinch his nosebecause theyre different he insisted like night and day or ice and fireif ice can burn said jojen in his solemn voice then love and hate can mate mountain or marsh it makes no matter the land is oneone his sister agreed but over wrinkledto be honest with you im not even sure why i come to this board at all im not nearly critical or negative enough about this adaptation to post here heck several of you actually brag about the size and ferocity of your rants this place is crazy townlol are you referring to me i didnt mean to brag about it someone just congratulate me for whatever reason and i said thank you and when i said you shouldve seen last weeks i meant that it was longer thats it i didnt mean to brag about it now i cannot even say thank you to someone who liked my post just because this is the nitpick thread and therefore my post was full of rantswhen did tyrion become such a beacon for hatred with book fansfor me was when i lost complete interest in the show version of one of my favorite characters in the whole series even after adwdpeople are pissed because he gets so many linesbecause he gets so many pointless scenes just so he can appear in every episode while taking time away from other characters who are more important at the momenttheyre pissed because hes not made out to be evil etc personallybecause theyve taken a lot of his fascinating complexity away from himtyrion is easily one of my top three characters from the books and i always saw him more good than evil as well so personally i like their portrayal of himof pov characters definitely my favorite but i dont understand how can a tyrion fan love his portrayal except for peter dinklage i find tyrion fascinating for me he is a good guy but not a hero he is morally ambiguous and flawed he is far from being perfect and is very complex he is the most moral of his family at least up to asos but he is a lannister he doesnt concern himself with being honorable or just he is willing to be ruthless and to go as far as necessary to acomplish his goals and defend and help his family he is not afraid of committing crimes they both hate to admit it but he is indeed his fathers son i love all that about tyrion but all that so far has been greatly decreased or completely taken away from him he is just a misunderstood hero and a witty comedy relief he is not very complex and he is pretty much white i dont like that in fact i hate that where is the so interesting tyrion i knew and lovedhes the epitome of doing a lot with very little just my opinionagree edited by darth zyroth 22 may 2013  0547 am"

"jeffklm",2013-05-22,"my nitpick regardless of the above is of course the tyrionsansa wedding for me it is an issue of sansa kneeling because while it is true that she also kneeled in the book the presentations are largely distinct from one another because of the whitewashing of tyrion on hbo because she knew of her nuptials sansa and tyrion rather played it with a feeling of well were both victims in this together versus a total surprise and sansa refusing to kneel initially because it was the only defiant action available to her it is only when she realizes that tyrion is an equal pawn powerless and worse the physical manifestation of comical farce that she kneels yes both scenes conclude at the same end but the method by which they travel there is the difference between a complex and grey character and a whitewashed character in effect it is the very reason why there are books and then there are adaptations books are and have always been the more valuable and enriching of the two because it requires active participation in a way that passive viewing does not that said adaptations do not by virtue of their particular medium have to suck ballsthis is a brilliantly written assessment to which i completely agree jaqen hgharmeets aryakills people for aryachanges facesgives arya the coin and valar morgolustyriondoes not perform magical acrobaticsis not saved by cat when she slits someones throat on the way to the valedoes not confess to having taken tysha after all his fathers men and throwing a gold coin for the effortdoes not pledge in front of the entire court to return sansa and arya to catelyndoes not kill simon silver tonguedoes not tell sansa about the weddingdoes not refrain from acknowledging that he wants sansa and all that that entailsdoes not come to the marriage bed naked with every intention of consummating his marriage with his new 13 year old brideidk that seems a little altered to me but maybe you were kiddingthe whitewashing of tyrion is the biggest issue i have with the series as a whole by creating a perfect heroic figure in tyrion they also birthed the biggest flaw of the show ironic"

"Newstar",2013-05-24,"yeah so this line from tyrion to sansa raised my book reader hackles a littleive noticed that whenever a character in this series makes a big show of promising that he or she will never do something or stating confidently that another character would never do something events have a way of proving them wrong catelyns vow never to ask brienne any service that would bring her dishonour ahem so what should we make of tv tyrions promise to sansa never to hurt herthe line kind of seemed like a tweakedfortv version of tyrions line to sansa in acok i vow i shall not savage you complete with reassuring handarm squeeze but the writers didnt need to include it in 3x08 so why is it in there also it seems like a little thing but book tyrion promised he wouldnt hurt well savage sansa not that he would never hurt her that never bugs me it could be something innocuous like setting up tyrions decision later in season 4 presumably not to implicate sansa in joffreys murder or it could be something less innocuousnow going off the books as of adwd tyrion hasnt done anything to hurt sansa and hasnt savaged her either so maybe this will be a promise that tyrion both in the books and the show winds up keeping heck tyrion and sansa may never even meet again in the books on the other hand if tyrion continues to spiral into straightup villainy even though he doesnt have any specific revenge plans against sansa at the moment as opposed to say cersei that could change in a hurry if he returns to westeros and decides to cross the vale off his revenge list theres been a lot of speculation that tyrion is in fact the savage giant sansa is prophesied to slay as per the ghost of high hearts prophecy while i have my doubts about that personally i can see a conflict in the vale with sansa on the vales side and tyrion on the otherso what do you think foreshadowing of tyrion hurting or trying to hurt sansa down the line or just a tweaked version of book dialogue"
"Woman of War",2013-06-02,"didnt you newstar post yourself that tyrion simply does not have enough emotion towards sansa in him to commit a crime of hate against her but that he hardly thinks of herit was in the shae thread of e08may i quote you about the question if tyrion might strangle sansai dunno hes not always thinking she betrayed him he lumps her in with shae and with other false women the one time in adwd but his reaction to sansa fleeing her marriage in asos is what did you expect in adwd he seems pretty unconcerned about her he calls her false the one time as i said but he also compares penny with all her pretty dreams to sansa late in adwd whom he describes as the child bride he wed and lost and not say as that conniving heartless bitch who framed me for murder whatever negative or resentful feelings he does hold towards sansa as of adwdand he really doesnt seem to think much about her one way or the otherseem pretty mild for someone who has every reason to believe she murdered joffrey and left him to take the blame for it honestly he seems more pissed off in asos about her refusal to kneel at the wedding than anything else and in adwd he cant even be bothered to think about thatconsidering how much foreshadowing is allegedly hidden in every word ever written and said about sansa there might though be a lot of it in  astonishingly long neck biggrinpng classbbcemoticon altd   careful joke edited by woman of war 02 june 2013  0550 pm"

"Woman of War",2013-06-03,"of course this phrase can be a strong indicator though i do not think that tyrion would harm sansa intentionally it is still possible that she might be a tragic victim of some attack eg on the eyrie with dragons as collateral damage driving tyrion even deeper into a guilt and madness spiral because he failed all his women a propos and if i never want you to seriously this is the sentence pending that might easily be proven wrong so much never in it"

"Don Roberto",2013-05-21,"as sam will probably only appear again in the season finale i see three possibilities 1 sam meeting coldhands in ep 10 and thats it improbable as its not big enough an event for the finale 2 sam meeting coldhands in the beginning of ep 10 and in the end his scene with bran maybe but unlikely as it would feel too rushed 3 no coldhands this season sam finds the black gate himself either by accident or being guided by ravens and we end with his scene with bran probably whats going to happen given what we know about the end of the season if coldhands is not introduced this season he could either be skipped entirely or be the end of brans storyline next season given that s4 will be the rest of storm of swords and maybe a little bit of the other two books technically bran would disappear now and not reappear until s5 but the producers dont seem too fond of keeping big cast members away from the screen for entire seasons so id wager that bran will have part of his journey in s4 they could just make jojen take him all the way and reach the childrens cave by s4s finale but then what would they do with him the next two seasons my bet is that in s4 jojen will lead him north but not really sure where to or maybe to the wrong place hardhome and meet coldhands by the end of it and then resume brans journey in s5 more bythebook"

"Mladen",2013-05-20,"ok this is continuation of the discussing sansa iiheres op review of the sansa scenes from previous thread and the three last postsops review of sansas wedding and bedding discussing sansa this season was particularly hard since we had no idea where the producers are heading with her character it was a bit ambiguous what they wanted to achieve with her scenes her characterization in this season and now after sansas big scene came out all doubts are gone they were heading nowhere executive producers of the show dd always made us remember that they are as big fans of the books as the most of us but that show is separate entity well i am now fully convinced this episode showed us that even for dd canon material means so little the scenes i am talking about are in total collision with martins envision of the wedding but where did it all began this entire season portrayed sansa as the pawn in the game of real players <U+0080><U+0093> littlefinger qot varys and tywin she was just a beautiful girl with old name and basically they got that part well the machinations politics were the highlight of the season but where dd epically failed is showing that one of two windows we see plots of kings landing is actually sansa how could they ever forget that is completely beyond my comprehension the thing here isnt sansas position in the game we are all aware she is just a pawn the problem is that her character lacked this season any serious depth or even layers that would make her at least more interesting dds imagination of sansa is basically the same all male characters in the show have about her and they have stipulated her to a great beauty with old name you would think with dozen of povs and several dozens of pages grrm wrote about her would make them think more deeply about her and yet they didnt sansa was a sidekick this season and the worst part is that her moment the moment we knew is all about her was transformed into something else sansas storyarc in this episode began when tyrion visited her before the wedding the awkward conversation was a nice touch but it failed to show the real positions of the two characters tyrion led the conversation and basically made it all about him it needed only one line i doubt that very much to respond on tyrions socalled empathy and to give us the right picture of that wedding but then again they shifted the perspective from her to him his line about not hurting her is interesting because he is supposed to be prince charming after joffrey and loras and sansa should be thankful for having him we have been seeing this for quite some time and although we all know how many wrong things are in this scene we cant deny that it fits perfectly with everything we have seen thus far the wedding ceremony began with interaction between joffrey and sansa those of us who read the books remember sansas fierce respond to joffreys statement that he is supposed to be her father in this matter again gods and dd know why that respond was cut off funny or sad you choose it it seems that only score is depicting sansas misery about this wedding ramin djawadi did a great job here and filled the holes the writers <U+0080><U+0093> dd left quietly with dignity accompanied with great music sansa walked down the aisle and then as we couldnt predicted joffreys malice shifted again the spotlight from sansa to tyrion its like we needed reminder that marrying a dwarf from family who destroyed your life is nothing comparing to marrying great beauty with old name and possibility to control half the realm here you have to congratulate the writers they have done impossible i honestly couldnt believe its possible to feel sorry for tyrion over sansa in this marriage but somehow thats the impression i have during this wedding but where i totally wanted to shut down my screen is the kneeling part not kneeling in front of tyrion while knowing how hurtful it is for him was always one of the breakthrough moments for sansa not seeing it well we have all seen it coming lets face it we knew there is no chance writers will give sansa to show how harsh she can be to truly position them on their right places no another chance and another scene were ruined and it all leads to question how many more will we have to see before sansas character is truly lost and now quick derail for the ladies from ptp thread have you seen that dress every nerve of my body was on fire due to the wrong colors of the dress lack of stark maiden cloak and general lack of symbolism in this wedding it was weird ceremony but one can argue it was meant to be where the writers hit the cord was the feast and not sansas part of course but the tywintyrionjoffreys interaction i liked it as much as i liked it in the books and all three actors excelled here the scene was both dramatic and interesting to see how the three great actors confront with their strong characters and now we come to weird part <U+0080><U+0093> the wedding night here again the task was shared between writers and music department while writers were focusing on tyrions monologue the music showed how hurtful this is for sansa the realization of her age finally puts the both of them under the light and its incredibly wonderful to see how finally tyrion gets some moral ambiguity this season but at the end he did the right thing but here sansa just like in the books pushed the things further away and then one of the best part of tonights season and now my watch begins sansas behavior in the books got the line here of course it would all make much more sense if sansa was colder to tyrion and showed him that she is a stark of winterfell where winters are long and harsh that way the nw and the wall reference would have its full meaning the story ended with clean sheet and shae realizing that things are not simple for either of them whether you like it or not the conversation we had the last time finally showed one thing producers love tyrion they are ready to make him far better and heroic and they dont mind whose character are they going to destroy this entire episode was about tyrion and his troubles of marrying sansa and him doing the right thing and although they are entitled to do that i wish they didnt behave like the high school fan boys who cheer for the best guy luckily for all of us djawadis music was beautifully composed and really cast a light on sansas torments much more than actual text did to expect from the show what we had in books is unrealistic and i am aware of that but we can here see how deep and meaningful grrms writing is we can see now that although he is man he is sophisticated soul that can understand each and every of his character and thats something producers and writers of this episode miss and thats why the show will never reach the depth books havepost from wouteras i wrote in the sansa and tyrion thread sansa noticed that joffrey took the footstool away yet didnt kneel of her own volition when tyrion actually politiely asked her she did not so terribly different from the books imosansa did show grace and strength in the way she held herself throughout the wedding unlike cersei who acted much like at the blackwater againpost from bbstarkits not the same as showing defiance in a public place in front of everyone she hates and who are holding her prisonerits also not the same to have the wedding sprung on her the day of instead of having all these people assure her just how good tyrion is its not the same that sansa has so much interaction with marg who turns away from her in the books when shes married tyrion instead of encouraging her before sansa in the show is treated like a shallow and weak young girl not the desperate young girl who is slowly becoming stronger every day while surviving in a completely hostile environment her potrayal in the show is first and foremost as someone weak and thats unfortunatepost from jatyadothe wedding scene is horrible very horrible they didnt made sansa kneelwhich showcase her strength and im not even a fan but they couldnt show this because they already show sansa being a bitch about how she doesnt like tyrion for being a dwarf and the whitewashing of tyrion is getting into my nerves hes looking more like a victim and they even had to make joffrey take the bench so he could be more pitiable madgif classbbcemoticon altangry  i still love the dark grey tyrion in the books its kinda disappointing because peter dinklage is such a good actor that im curious about how he would

"Garlan Marius",2013-05-19,"so the one scene i was actually looking forward to the one scene where sansa finally has the guts let her feelings known about the wedding to everyone in proximity is the one scene they decide to cut out excuse me while i go scream into my pillowim no purist but this is the one scene i needed to see as it was in the book what a terrible changeit wouldnt have made her seem so much like a bitch if they hadnt insisted on whitewashing tyrion so much that he hardly even resembles the character he is in the booksthis as well i love me some booktyrion hes a beautifullydone grey character that one can empathize with but also condemn theres nothing about showtyrion that we can condemn hes some unlikely hero an avatar for the disadvantaged perceived or not to project themselves onto he needs his flaws he needs singer stew which seems like the only saving grace for his characterization"
"sansatyrell",2013-05-19,"i see zero difference between book sansa and show sansalol i mean the kneel was a huge difference thank god they still had her say what if i never want you to when tyrion said he wouldnt touch her until she wanted him too drypng classbbcemoticon alt "

"go joff go",2013-05-19,"they just couldnt do it i liked that she didnt kneel but but people wouldnt have forgiven her and thats a fact since we have a legion of book fans who despise her grrm never intended for her to receive the hate she did so i just cant get mad when they temper the things she did if she hadnt kneeled it would have looked like an fu to tyrion not the lannister"

"Dr. Pepper",2013-05-19,"post deletedi can agree with this to an extent shes a bit more fleshed out than she was at this point in the books the thing is if they are going to make these changes and adjustments for characters like cersei or tyrion or tywin it would make sense to adjust other characters as well like sansa one feels sorry for sansa having to marry a lannister but not sorry that sansa has to marry tyrion because tyrion is so nice and friendlyits hard to explain and im sure someone else can do it better but its just not working for me i dont feel horror for sansa the way i did in the books i am by no means a book purist this is my first purist moment but not adjusting sansa along with the other characters is just infuriating me edited by stubby 19 may 2013  1016 pm amendment of quoted post now deleted"

"lostinwesteros",2013-05-19,"i thought sansa played this episode perfectly the writing for her part was great and i thought the kneeling was done well seems most of the posters on this thread liked that sansa didnt kneel in the book and didnt want her to in the hbo series but that was actually one part in the book that made me dislike sansa for a time there so im glad hbo handled it the way they did even without that joff had taken the step stool away so what else were either of them to do have sansa stand there forever with tyrion jumping up and down to get the cape over her shoulders there was no dontos for tyrion to use as a footstool"

"Mladen",2013-05-20,"ok i have watched the episode two hours ago and i am finally ready to give you piece of my mind in the shape of my very own review oif the sansa scenes i hope youll find it interesting and i hope itll give you something to think abouti would also like to thanks dr pepper and brashcandy for taking my place and starting a great conversation on the thread friends like they are are very rare and i am so happy they helped me in this way again ladies thank you and here we goops review of sansas wedding and bedding discussing sansa this season was particularly hard since we had no idea where the producers are heading with her character it was a bit ambiguous what they wanted to achieve with her scenes her characterization in this season and now after sansas big scene came out all doubts are gone they were heading nowhere executive producers of the show dd always made us remember that they are as big fans of the books as the most of us but that show is separate entity well i am now fully convinced this episode showed us that even for dd canon material means so little the scenes i am talking about are in total collision with martins envision of the wedding but where did it all began this entire season portrayed sansa as the pawn in the game of real players <U+0080><U+0093> littlefinger qot varys and tywin she was just a beautiful girl with old name and basically they got that part well the machinations politics were the highlight of the season but where dd epically failed is showing that one of two windows we see plots of kings landing is actually sansa how could they ever forget that is completely beyond my comprehension the thing here isnt sansas position in the game we are all aware she is just a pawn the problem is that her character lacked this season any serious depth or even layers that would make her at least more interesting dds imagination of sansa is basically the same all male characters in the show have about her and they have stipulated her to a great beauty with old name you would think with dozen of povs and several dozens of pages grrm wrote about her would make them think more deeply about her and yet they didnt sansa was a sidekick this season and the worst part is that her moment the moment we knew is all about her was transformed into something else sansas storyarc in this episode began when tyrion visited her before the wedding the awkward conversation was a nice touch but it failed to show the real positions of the two characters tyrion led the conversation and basically made it all about him it needed only one line i doubt that very much to respond on tyrions socalled empathy and to give us the right picture of that wedding but then again they shifted the perspective from her to him his line about not hurting her is interesting because he is supposed to be prince charming after joffrey and loras and sansa should be thankful for having him we have been seeing this for quite some time and although we all know how many wrong things are in this scene we cant deny that it fits perfectly with everything we have seen thus far the wedding ceremony began with interaction between joffrey and sansa those of us who read the books remember sansas fierce respond to joffreys statement that he is supposed to be her father in this matter again gods and dd know why that respond was cut off funny or sad you choose it it seems that only score is depicting sansas misery about this wedding ramin djawadi did a great job here and filled the holes the writers <U+0080><U+0093> dd left quietly with dignity accompanied with great music sansa walked down the aisle and then as we couldnt predicted joffreys malice shifted again the spotlight from sansa to tyrion its like we needed reminder that marrying a dwarf from family who destroyed your life is nothing comparing to marrying great beauty with old name and possibility to control half the realm here you have to congratulate the writers they have done impossible i honestly couldnt believe its possible to feel sorry for tyrion over sansa in this marriage but somehow thats the impression i have during this wedding but where i totally wanted to shut down my screen is the kneeling part not kneeling in front of tyrion while knowing how hurtful it is for him was always one of the breakthrough moments for sansa not seeing it well we have all seen it coming lets face it we knew there is no chance writers will give sansa to show how harsh she can be to truly position them on their right places no another chance and another scene were ruined and it all leads to question how many more will we have to see before sansas character is truly lost and now quick derail for the ladies from ptp thread have you seen that dress every nerve of my body was on fire due to the wrong colors of the dress lack of stark maiden cloak and general lack of symbolism in this wedding it was weird ceremony but one can argue it was meant to be where the writers hit the cord was the feast and not sansas part of course but the tywintyrionjoffreys interaction i liked it as much as i liked it in the books and all three actors excelled here the scene was both dramatic and interesting to see how the three great actors confront with their strong characters and now we come to weird part <U+0080><U+0093> the wedding night here again the task was shared between writers and music department while writers were focusing on tyrions monologue the music showed how hurtful this is for sansa the realization of her age finally puts the both of them under the light and its incredibly wonderful to see how finally tyrion gets some moral ambiguity this season but at the end he did the right thing but here sansa just like in the books pushed the things further away and then one of the best part of tonights season and now my watch begins sansas behavior in the books got the line here of course it would all make much more sense if sansa was colder to tyrion and showed him that she is a stark of winterfell where winters are long and harsh that way the nw and the wall reference would have its full meaning the story ended with clean sheet and shae realizing that things are not simple for either of them whether you like it or not the conversation we had the last time finally showed one thing producers love tyrion they are ready to make him far better and heroic and they dont mind whose character are they going to destroy this entire episode was about tyrion and his troubles of marrying sansa and him doing the right thing and although they are entitled to do that i wish they didnt behave like the high school fan boys who cheer for the best guy luckily for all of us djawadis music was beautifully composed and really cast a light on sansas torments much more than actual text did to expect from the show what we had in books is unrealistic and i am aware of that but we can here see how deep and meaningful grrms writing is we can see now that although he is man he is sophisticated soul that can understand each and every of his character and thats something producers and writers of this episode miss and thats why the show will never reach the depth books have"
"ohpooratlas",2013-05-20,"i remember when the original thread was started people were whining about how childish and immature sansa was being when she said she did not want to marry tyrion because he was a dwarf and now people are whining because she kneeled we cant have it both ways im okay with sansa being a little empathtic towards tyrion i think that actually shows a growth in maturity at the same time she still asks what if she never wantst to bed him so she hasnt been completely changed i for one did not want to see sansa throw a temper tantrum during her wedding also sansa not kneeling has nothing to do with the white washing of tyrons character its an act she does not him i actually think that the fact that tyrion got so obnoxiously drunk at his wedding and embaressed both himself and his wife was a wonderful way of reminding us that hes still immature and horrible at confrontation when it comes to his family the only thing i was bummed about was the fact that we didnt get the in the dark im the knight of flowers line but i understand they probably witheld it due to sansas age in the show edited by ohpooratlas 20 may 2013  0224 am"
"Mladen",2013-05-20,"we cant have it both ways im okay with sansa being a little empathtic towards tyrion i think that actually shows a growth in maturity at the same time she still asks what if she never wantst to bed him so she hasnt been completely changedi for one did not want to see sansa throw a temper tantrum during her weddingalso sansa not kneeling has nothing to do with the white washing of tyrons character its an act she does not himbut the kneeling wasnt just that it was clear demonstration of who she is and how much of stark blood is in her if it was just for the sake of empathy or the wedding i would say ok not big deal but this was also about her identity and her unwillingness to bend the knee to lannistersas for white washing they did different thing today they completely shifted the objective from her to him and thats even worse"

"Penguin king",2013-05-20,"just finished watching this episode and i want to post my thoughts on the tyrionsansa plotline while theyre fresh in my mind so forgive me if a lot of this has already been covered 1 sansa kneeling i knew this was going to be controversial as i watched i agree that it alters sansas character in a pretty big way but i can see why they did it sansa is already one of the least popular characters on the show and tyrion the most popular if theyd made a big point of sansas one small act of defiance then i think sansa would have been in line for even more hate from some of the non book reading tv viewers theres no disputing that tv tyrion has been whitewashed and that this has had some unfortunate implications when it comes to his relationships with other characters however im going to express an opinion thats probably equally controversial book tyrion is meant to be sympathetic grrm wants us to like him dispite his more evil acts i think dd are of the opinion that tv viewers need a hero and have therefore made an already sympathetic character even more likeable and thats had the unfortunate side effect of altering how viewers see characters like shae and sansa 2 tyrion smiling at the wedding i found this odd considering grrm makes a point of telling us how miserable he is in the book i know he was drunk but he still seemed to be enjoying himself a little too much doesnt directly relate to sansa so ill leave that at that 3 lack of nudity ok so the show made a pretty big departure from the books here i think it really hurt both characters it made tyrion look way too chivalrous and sansa was spared all the emotional torment of having to undress infront of a man she barely knows then have him climb over her drunk and naked on the other hand i can see why they had to change it sophie was what 16 when the filmed the scene i imagine there are laws about the sexulizing of minors on televison and sophie is a minor by us standards even if shes over the age of sexual consent in the uk not only that but sophie herself would probably have had issues appearing naked and i doubt the scene as written would have played well with hbos target audience they could have gotten around it by having only peter appear naked but well theres tyrion white washing to do so on the other hand the scene could easily have gone further than it did tyrion showed almost no sexual interest in sansa and thats a pretty big departure tyrion is a man with strong urges and his cock often wins out over his brain they really should have presented that struggle especially as this is one of the few times where his brain comes out ahead thats all i can think of for now ended up focusing more on tyrion than sansa but so does the show so i guess thats appropriate ill skim through the thread and try and jog my memory about all the things im forgetting"
"Demandred",2013-05-20,"i didnt have a problem with sansas reaction a few things in the scene and in this storyline are different and her reaction is just a reflection of that in the books she had no clue that she was getting married until the day and tyrion is much more sympathetic to her plight in the show than he is in the books i believe that she realises that not to mention that margaery has been whispering in sansas ear trying to convince that shes landed a decent deal and she should make the most of it all these factors have to be taken into consideration although to the post above regarding tyrion and sexual interest in sansa i felt that it was apparent that he was very attracted to her as she was undressing just from the way he was gazing at her when she said that she would not like to sleep with him he backed off but was clearly disappointed"
"Joyful Union",2013-05-20,"the lengths that people will go to defend dds decisions sansa not kneeling is the result of 2 years of bad decisions made by dd it is the epitome of why got will simply never be a classic tv series it is simple the result of 2 years of mischaracterization cliched simplization and lack of vision tyrion sould be another al swearengen or tony soprano or walter white with all the moral ambiguity that goes along with it that would make the show so much better than what it is as a result characters like sansa would have far more depth to them of course they had to have her kneel to tyrion it was the only logical ending for how they have developed the relationship but that takes forgetting that tyrion is the uncle of the king who lopped her fathers head off in front of her and sansas actions make her truly look idiotic and without substancesorry epic failthe lengths people will go to demonize dd are equally considerable take this post for example many people consider got to be already a classic and the show doesnt only have considerable popular success but critical success as well"
"SerMixalot",2013-05-20,"never said it wasnt a good show i said it was not what it could be dd made conscious decisions to white wash tyrion leading inevitably to sansa not kneeling at her wedding that detracts considerably from sansas character making her seem far less strong and intelligent and thus less interesting tyrion by being white washed is far less interesting sansa smiled while being lead from the room by her groom to be who happened to be the uncle of the king who lopped off her head a normal reaction to that would be utter heart wrenching disgust"
"Demandred",2013-05-20,"she didnt smile as she was following tyrion to their quarters she had a look of worry on her face theres still considerable opportunity to demonstrate her strength and intelligence the act of kneeling in order to assist tyrion doesnt detract from that"
"Tywin's bastard",2013-05-20,"surprising that people are complaining about sansa kneeling since that part loses so much from not being able to be inside her head i dont see how they could make that come across the way it is in the books and it seems incredibly weird to not take into account how very different the tv medium is when you analyze this on tv it would do nothing but enhance the bad situation for tyrion it wouldnt be sansa making a stand no pun intended in her bad situation for people that havent read the books peoples inability to really look at the differences in the two mediums and being far too bound to the original seem to really lower the chances for them to enjoy this too bad for them but its entirely up to themselves what they want to do"

"Penguin king",2013-05-20,"ok cant think of anything specific to do with the episode but some general points 1 dds take on sansa sansa is a difficult character to translate to television because so much of what we learn about her comes from whats shes thinking outwardly shes general a model of calm courtesyeven though we know the emotions shes feeling and the thoughts that are going through her head are a lot more complex jon snow suffers from the same problem being another character that doesnt always say what hes thinking thats not to say dd have made the best of a difficult character to write for by cutting a lot of the hound and dontos scenes sansas character has missed out on some important character development and her replacement scenes with shae littlefinger and maraery havent always been of the highest quality when they make sansa voice questions such as will my family be allowed to the wedding she seems naive and childish she has a healthy fantasy life in the books too but she knows the difference between her dreams and reality and while she fantasies about her ideal life with wilas shes also aware that all he would want her for his her claim on winterfell tv sansa lacks that sort of complexity 2 tyrion is not sansas enemy a lot of people have been arguing that since sansa is a stark and tyrion is a lannister the two must be enemies and sansa is right to treat him as such i dont see it that way tyrion wishes no harm on sansa hes never harmed another member of her family he may have fought against robbs men in battle but that doesnt mean he and sansa have to treat each other adversarially i understand why shed be weary of him considering all the wrongs cersei joffrey andtywin have done to her but hurting tyrion doesnt hurt the rest of his family i dont expect her to come to love him but i dont feel shed be right to hate him either 3 forced marriages and arranged marriages the line here is a lot greyer than people think show sansa concented to marry loras i can agree she was infatuated with him and her choice seemed genuine however i dont feel that the same can be said for her book counterpart and willas sansa did not know wilas she had no preexisting desire to marry him at first she even seemed crestfallen by the idea but marrying willas was a price a price she had to pay if she wanted to be free from joffrey and cersei she may have given her consent and even talked herself into liking the idea but you cant deny there was a large element of coersion marry willas and have your freedom or stay here and get beatenrapedworse is that really any better a choice than the lannisters were offering her another example lysa tully and jon arryn clearly an arranged marriage but a loveless one lysa may have consented to her fathers will however the marriage was still a loveless one hoster tully had driven away the boy she truely loved and had even forced her to abort the bastard child she was carrying was lysas situation any fairer than sansas was lysa any happier after the marriage did she really have that much more of a choice"
"Fragile Bird",2013-05-20,"dont need to patronice what i meant to say was that might be some who have no problem if such a scene existsyou dont need to be so prickly and you need to read responses i said sansa is 14 in the hbo scene she answers tyrions question a scene with her naked in bed would amount to child pornography in many of the countries the show is seen whether or not the characters are married in what way would showing nude scenes with arya and gendry be possible pray tell we are discussing the hbo tv series here not the books and irrespective of all the shipping of arya and gendry no way would they show that beyond the schoolgirl crush kind of conversation arya and gendry have just before his departure and since you obviously have read the aryagendry ship posts you also know pretty well everyone talks about when they are older because a 4 year age difference when you are 11 is significant and those who contemplate an 11 year old and a 15 year in a relationship arent talking about a sexual relationship"

"juanml82",2013-05-20,"heres another of my problems with the wedding so much of it was about cersei resisting the things going on around her instead of sansa doing this cersei is the queen regent sansa is a hostage but youd hardly remember that in this episode what happened to the sansa who told joffrey that maybe her brother would bring her his head or the sansa who wanted to push joffrey off the ledgeshe was beaten by the kingsguardi didnt go through all the 12 pages i liked when sansa didnt kneel in the books but i think having her kneel works better in the show she wasnt physically trying to get away like in the books and the notkneeling being the last of her physical resistance there is no dontos so tyrion doesnt have many other ways to put the cloak and joffreys presence is a reminder of what will happen if she resistswe know she is there against her will joffrey also reminds us that shes against the marriage because hes a lannister so nothing to nitpick there the only nitpick i have is that she wasnt wearing stark colours when she walked into the sept but the show never mentioned house colours save for tyrell greeni liked sansa and tyrion arc this episode not the characters greatest moments but no idiocy either"

"Mladen",2013-05-20,"wow i really dont get the criticism at all regarding the wedding to me sansa fans should have loved this oneso the lines are still drawn regarding this one ok i should explain why me as sansa fan didnt like thisthe removal of the stool by joffrey presented sansa with a much different choice than what she had in the book so her action was different here joffrey was trying to humiliate tyrion and not kneeling would have been cooperatingplaying along with joffreys joke essentially kneeling was siding with tyrion rather than joffreyand why the stool was removed at the first place was that so neccessary the only effect it had it shifted perspective from sansa to tyrion the stool was something made up so you have to think about tyrion not sansa they managed very cunningly to make her miseries equal as his and they never were the same so although you have the point about sansa not kneeling here is the real question why did we have a stool taken by joffrey at the first placeand this is actually the first and only episode that i felt sophie turner actually acted and she made me feel more sympathetic to her plight than i ever felt for book sansa the misery on her face the who time was evident to me as were her lack of optionswe agree on this the two best parts about sansa this episode were music and sophie and although she was given one line comparing toi two dozens of tyrions she managed to do the best out of them and that was one hell of a jobbut this is where the book and show necessarily had to differ they couldnt show to a modern audience a 14 year old stripping down any further and having tyrion go as far as he went in the books would have made him seem a worse person than in the books the cultural gap between bedding a 14 year old in westeros versus the rl is just too large especially given dinklages apparent age to show on tv and have mean the same as its any in the bookswe also agree on this i understand the limitations they are facing with and i thought unlike in melisandres scene that this was the right line she was nude in terms of medieval society but dressed more than enough for us i liked the scene just i wish they were equal there"

"-Ghost-",2013-05-20,"my problem with the scene was that sansa looked more pleased about it than she should be as though she just realised that she was very lucky she was marrying the best lannister and she should be grateful for that her situation in the show is pretty much unless is not joffrey when in books its more like it could be worst but is still pretty bad she has accepted but shes miserable everybody notices that even tyrion himself who later has no idea how to please her nor even make her smile for a momentmany people complains that sansa is not a real stark but during her wedding she does behave as a stark as well as a tully she knows she cant escape as cersei pointed out they would take her by force if needed so she decides she would act honorably about it by going willingly instead of being dragged or cry but always showing that she was only doing it because it was her duty not her pleasure and thats why she doesnt bend the knee not help his husband in any way to put the cloack on her shes giving him and by implication all the lannisters a i dont f care how you manage to do this i wont move a muscle attitudethis episode didnt give me that impression they portray sansa as though she had accepted that she was marrying the best lannister and she had no problem about it but of course she had a problem he was a lannister accepting that marrying a lannister wasnt that bad was accepting that she was in good terms with the family that cut her fathers head and were in war with her brother didnt dany implied that things that dont break eventually break in sansas situation bending would be the proof that the lannister finally broke her downi agree with this i still hate that they changed it it was a small victory for sansa in a time of her life where she has absolutely no control of it"

"Mladen",2013-05-20,"yes because the scene as written would not have had the same meaning if recreated on the screen that entire wedding scene is told in the books with sansas internal thoughts but viewers dont see italicized internal thoughts  they only see actions so recreating the exact actions of the scenes without the internal thoughts is going to result in a portrayal with a different meaningone action we get in the book is sansas acknowledging that tryion was not joffrey and saying you were kind to me to tyrion before the ceremony so lets assume the book is followed and that gets said wedding begins with sansa acknowledging that tyrion has been kind to herbut that is the problem entire season we were seeing this train going straight to collision and we knew that every wrong choice they made is going to be paid if tyrion didnt walk to sansa and talked to her sansas reaction would be much different and then you wouldnt be surprised she didnt kneel and the problem with that idea is that tyrion would look bad or at least he would be more bookish this entire episode wasnt mistake by itself mistakes made in it are consequences of poorly written season the moment in which she refuses to kneel was between the two of them her resistence and insensitivity and his shame and anger but on tv we got joffrey involved before it started and it was all about tyrion and joffrey sansa was just a neutral participant there and thats not by far what we had in booksthen the kneeling scene and here i think book sansa fans are guilty of some revisionism by misinterpreting her refusal to kneel as some big statement of principle but its not sansas emotions at that point are neither admirable nor positive sansas not thinking of any big issue when she refuses to kneel she hears everyone laughing at tyrion and then thinks in the text why should i spare his feelings when no one cares about mine thats not a protest in principle against mistreatment  its kicking the dog because you had a bad day at work stubbornly she pressed her lips together and pretended not to notice think of how that would look on screen its spoiled and selfcentered particularly because you just acknowledged to the audience that he was kind to you now youre acting immaturely and deliberately embarassing the one person who has actually been kind to you when he had nothing to gain by it in front of the entire court they were all laughing by then joffrey the loudest thats not right and it does not say something positive about her charactersansa refused to kneel before the first laugh but when the laugh became too loud and jokes were made she reconsidered her decision and knelt in one scene we have demonstration of her defiance and her compassion thats why this scene is important also the ruin of the marriage began with it for tyrion never forgave her for not kneeling itas for show i said it already out of frying pan into the fire you have every point when you say that not kneeling would be interpreted differently but the problem here is that it was created atmosphere where her refusal to kneel would be interpreted as something else and the only ones who are 100 guilty about it are writers this episode is just result of everything we have seen entire seasonthe mediums are different and sometimes you have to change things up to get to the same place to me the only growth sansa actually showed as a person here was when she was ashamed of her actions and actually managed to do the mature thing and separate her anger at her situation from the person who had done her no harm and hell even if people disagree that tyrion was kind the text says that sansathought he was and that sansa was ashamed of herself for not kneelingnot kneeling was progress in one direction kneeling in another and these two parallel growingups didnt exclude each other in the books the medium is different and i agree we cant see everything but we can see something with good actors you can do wonders and these two could make perfect wedding if only writers have deeper vision about it but entire thing was subdued to tyrion and his feelings first the long monologue then the stool then the drinking and arguing with joffrey and lastly another dialogue which was about him sansa was here saying a word or two completely being cut off in some way from whats happening to herbut i have to agree when you cross the rubicon its too late and rubicon here was crossed in episode 6 when tyrion told sansa about the wedding so every scene from both of them from that moment is directly influenced and tarnished with it so was this episode bad because of itself no there were some great detail involving sansa too but the greatest problem is that mistake was made long before and just like in chain reaction one thing influences the next oneas someone who appreciates good and polite discussion i have to thank you for giving me one we have difference of opinions and i doubt each one of us will soon change his pov but that is not reason for insulting again thank you for that"

him some sort of ned v2oh and yeh not to be a bitch but back in medieval or fantasy land or 21st century if you think that a man that would rape a sex slave throw up over her and rape her a second time could never be considered a very good guy then i have nothing more to argue as i find that very offensive it doesnt matter that that is seen as okay in his world because a man that would do that can never be simply good guyive been posting on this series since the board before this one the board before that one and the board before that so it isnt like im unfamiliar with the books or online discussions of characters going back more than 15 yearsfrankly i dont care how long youve been discussing this it all stems from the same source material that we have both read and that we have both seen how can you deny that they have whitewashed him they have taken out so many of the shitty things he does and people have even listed all those things in this very thread which so very clearly shows they have whitewashed himi personally believe that people should be judged in the context of the times in which they live tyrion would be a much shittier guy in the 21st century but hes not in the 21st century i look at his acts of kindness towards people who meant nothing to him the best way to judge character and i see him helping bran and jon while knowing that their family hates him i seem him being kind to and standing up for sansa before he had any motive to do so simply because he thought it was wrong and thats after being raised in an immediate family of borderline sociopaths who except for jaime have hated and tormented him since birth given that i think hes come out more than okayi can fully accept the good things that tyrion has done i really can his fondess for jon was quite charming his helping bran is selfless however the good does not wash out the bad and a lot of the crimes he commits are bad in his world and not only in ours so dont pull the whole stop judging him by modern standards he breaks someones fingers out of malice he kills someone and makes them into soup out of malice i cant stress this enough he rapes a sex slave realises what he has just done is very wrong vomits all over her and then continues to rape her again this is not a very good guy and even though she is a slave in that world it is still a disgusting thing and dont ever tell me that just because shes a sex slave what tyrion does is ok as a character because you can be god damn sure i am judging the hell out of a rapist he is not a nice man but he has done nice things he is not a good man but he has done good things he is not an evil man but he has definitely done evil things so why are you denying some of his cruel actsalso not raping sansa just means he is not a monster not raping her does not make him a good man it does not warrant him a medal of any kind so dont tell me how kind he was to a girl he forcibly married and was ready to fuck right before he saw how repulsed she wasi dont want an argument on this scene in regards to marital rape being a crimethe worst stain on him is tysha but as horrible as it was i think tywin was the real villain there tyrion was a young boy whod been abused by that fucker his whole life and then was placed into this situation that must have been a nightmare for him and ive always read his character as having been ashamed of his eventual participation in that rape in fact i think it haunts him to the point where his participation in that rape is the core reason why he kills his fatheractually tysha is one of the things i dont consider to be tyrions biggest stain as you say because i agree that tywin was the monster here however i do think as tyrion participated he became abuser and victimso i dont want an argument on tysha because he has done plenty of evil acts by himself without the brainwashing of his fatherin the context of westerosi morals and the times in which he lived i dont view his actions as the 21st century moral equivalent of some 13 year old boy raping a girl still horrible but his age father etc dont make it a thing that makes me judge him adversely more than a decade laterbut youre just arguing about something that i never even brought up so i wont continue hereso to me tyrion hasnt been whitewashed because i thought he was a damn good guy to begin with his flawssins to me were minimal given normal westerosi morals and his horrible abusive upbringing hes a whoremonger drinker and willing to live on his familys wealth so hes not a ned stark paragon of virtue with on the show or in the booksi simply vehemently disagree if you are readiing the same material that i am reading i am simply appaled that certain areas of tyrions character have been completely missed to youhe is a grey character i never aim to completely demonise him but he is not a good guy no no nodont over simplify a very complex character into either good or bad because he does not fall into good he is not a good manyes he has done good things but fucking surely you should come to the conclusion that he is a very grey character by simply thinking him a hero and a good guy to me you are missing soooo much of a very complex character edited because all of my response contains lots of spoilers sorry if anyone saw edited by theda baratheon 20 may 2013  1111 am"

"bbstark",2013-05-20,"whether you like it or not the conversation we had the last time finally showed one thing producers love tyrion they are ready to make him far better and heroic and they dont mind whose character are they going to destroy this entire episode was about tyrion and his troubles of marrying sansa and him doing the right thing and although they are entitled to do that i wish they didnt behave like the high school fan boys who cheer for the best guy luckily for all of us djawadis music was beautifully composed and really cast a light on sansas torments much more than actual text did to expect from the show what we had in books is unrealistic and i am aware of that but we can here see how deep and meaningful grrms writing is we can see now that although he is man he is sophisticated soul that can understand each and every of his character and thats something producers and writers of this episode miss and thats why the show will never reach the depth books haveok so i havent read the whole thread and im not sure when ill have time to catch up so forgive me if this was already mentioned but what if dd are actually subverting the story a bitwhat if they plan on introducing the greyness of tyrions character because of sansa let me try and clarify in his chapters we got this sense after the purple wedding that she betrayed him and poor tyrion was left alone without anyone not even his reluctant wifewell what if instead they turn it around and focus on his words i will never hurt you and find a way for tyrion to hurt her as a result she decides to leave kl i know it sounds farfetched especially since they have yet to incorporate an escape route for sansa so turning this around to blame tyrion for going back on his word might be trickyit came to me when i rewatched the clip before the wedding when sansa actually sincerly smiled at him it wasnt a cold forced smile at all it actually conveyed that she is warming to him or maybe even believes him it simply wouldnt make sense at this point that she leaves him so easily if she actually believes his word so what is required for her to develop further is for him to fail on his wordi acknowledge that this would seriously change the course of her development and in terms of her relationship with men its problematic to say the least considering that the only man in the book that she puts her trust in is sandor and the others are merely there for her to develop inner strength but the only course i see for the show to get sansa there is if she extends a hand out to tyrion and he is the one that fails herthoughtseta additionally this would finally bring saint tyrion down a peg or two and we could finally move away from the sansa is shallow theme that i cant believe they are still peddling edited by bbstark 20 may 2013  0159 pm"

"Envie",2013-05-14,"im with those that think theres a good possibility that coldhands and samtheslayer scenes could be combined it wouldnt change the story that drastically since sam and gilly do meet coldhands soon at this stage in the story and the point at which he should have slain the white walker was way back when he was still with jon and the rest of the nights watch so they chose to delay that scene and combine it with coldhands to speed up that story arc seems legit im really curious what that preview scene with cersei was about who shes talking about every man woman and child and also why tyrion is so angry in the bit with tywin and joffrey though it seems likely thats where he tells joffrey hes not going to let him touch sansa anymore im relieved to see gendry tied up instead of being burned or something worse im assuming this means hes the source of the leeches instead of stannis"

even if they are still alive he isn<U+0080><U+0099>t likely to ever see them again and that arya and sansa are similarly lost if that<U+0080><U+0099>s the case he could be motivated to bring jon back

"bobbybuilderton",2013-05-16,"as for the coldhands and ww scenes well im quite sure they will be merged sam defending gilly from the white walker stabbing it killing it then breathing heavily not understanding what happened and all of a sudden all those ravens flying at them sam and gilly running and finding coldhands protecting them talking to them it will be an epic scene as for the bedding  i really hope we will get it i was thinking itd be a mass wight attack hed take down one realize theyre screwed still and then coldhands gets the resti was thinking that maybe theyd just have robb legitimize jon instead of naming him heir if hes legitimized he doesnt need to be named heir because then he automatically comes after robbs children plus it sets up ramsays legitimizing and it fits in with catelyns speech about being unable to keep her promise to love jon as one of her own so it gives her a reason to argue"
"Arkash",2013-05-16,"well we know a ww is involved like in the books and its a ww sam kills not a wight excellent idea though about the legitimazing  that could work perfectly right  im sure we will have a will when the news of sansa and tyrion wedding reaches robb and he will charge the blackfish with carrying it which means we wont see the blackfish holding the siege at riverrun but well or maybe even the blackfish will go back to riverrun in a first time to prepare the voyage to the north with the will and will be besieged there rather than having him lost in the neck like maege and galbart having him blocked at riverrun would be a nice idea edited by arkash 16 may 2013  0913 am"

"Arkash",2013-05-16,"like i said above im quite sure we will have the will and it will be carried by the blackfish who will then not go to the wedding who will later be blocked at riverrun besieged by lannister armies this way the blackfish becomes more important being a combination of maege mormont and galbart glover and we will see his whereabouts and the will whereabouts"
"Tone",2013-05-16,"bad idea imo it would suggest that it is really melissandre who killed him whereas i always saw it in the book as just well she sees they will die but takes no part in it and doing it the way you suggest would really make like she has a real hand in itinteresting take i always thought it added to her mystery after the leech scene it def gave me chills when learning about balons death and immediately i was worried for robb the rw was still a huge shocki like your take on it when i read it i never took it as these 3 died because of melisandre but part of me wondered if they would still be alive if she hadnt burned those 3 leeches"
"Colonel Green",2013-05-16,"i think robb will name jon his heir but will specify that he is the heir after any children he might have with talisa thus avoiding winterfell passing on to sansa and tyrion later on this means robb will hear of the wedding at kl but in episode 8 or 9  and then will send the blackfish with it to the northat this point i think the heir thing isnt happening theyve done everything this season to foreclose the need for him to do that between having him believe his brothers are still alive to actually having a child on the way"
"Where Boars Glow",2013-05-16,"i was thinking itd be a mass wight attack hed take down one realize theyre screwed still and then coldhands gets the resti was thinking that maybe theyd just have robb legitimize jon instead of naming him heir if hes legitimized he doesnt need to be named heir because then he automatically comes after robbs children plus it sets up ramsays legitimizing and it fits in with catelyns speech about being unable to keep her promise to love jon as one of her own so it gives her a reason to arguei have been thinking back on the tv show change of cat expressing her remorse over how she treated jon snow and how this may be the reason the gods are punishing her because she could never find the strength to do right by him maybe this episode will feature a cat redemption of her talking rob into legitamizing jon snow since rob now has an heir and she figures it wont matter"
"Northbound",2013-05-16,"i actually think cat will be the one to talk robb in to making the will and naming jon heir i dont think she trusts talisa did you notice the look on cats face when she walked out the tent when robb was holding and kissing talisa the look said to me i dont like this bitch and she up to something"

"WiDMNDBAMMD",2013-05-18,"dany meets the captain of the second sons mero the titans bastardi assume these are yunkais powerful friends i think rather than have different sellsword companies they will have only one with daario being a captain i think that in episode 10 in the battle or at the end of this episode daario will kill mero and become captain this would seem more likely as there is no point in returning when all he did was unintentionally help reveal barristans identity when will the dragons be namedi think youre right about daario killing the other leaders of the storm crows so that they can join danythe wedding of tyrion and sansaah how i have awaited this unfortunately it will not be as i hoped it would after all moon boy isnt in the show and dontos seems to have disappeared since garlan and willas are nonexistent it is likely that loras will dance with sansa if he hasnt already stormed out of the hall i wonder if tommen will return  tyrion likely drove that knife into the table while shouting at joffrey which will give him more reason to kill him i have no idea how cersei will come up with her linewhen they play rains of castamere at tyrion and sansas wedding cersei will explain what the song is about to margaery shouldnt she already know whatever though shell probably play dumb for dramatic reasons who is right behind her when she says every man woman and child is put to the sword two things this does one it again shows the conflict between marg and cersei and gives cersei a chance to point out her families power and what they do to traitors who betray them since she doesnt trust the tyrells the second is it tells the unsullied the story behind the lannister songthe dragonstone gangi think now that gendry has arrived they will do the leech thing stannis will copy arya and come up with his own hit list i am eagerly awaiting balons fall and yaraashas reappearance 9 or 10 but they might do something else with gendry  shadowbaby balon will die one way or another we know afterwards stannis will give his duty speech to davos while revealing gendrys presence and purpose in the castle will we see davos lessons with shireen and the longawaited davosmel chati dont think well get the names i think mel will just use the blood and throw it into a fire saying false king fall before the true king or some other crap like thatthe shewolf and the dogsandor and arya begin their journey to riverrunthe twins she will try to kill him i cant remember what stopped her in the books with the rock the hound wakes upor wasnt sleeping at all and takes it from her she kicks him and he says ill give you that one but if you try it again something about tying her up etcsamwell tarly other slayergilly and sam wind up in a deserted wildling village they hear a noise at night gilly says dont go out there but sam does anyway either sam successfully kills the other and coldhands shows up at a different point or sam tries to kill it and coldhands saves him but allows sam to be known as the one that killed it the first one is more likely but i am very confident of coldhands and slayer happening but since sam showed gilly the dagger in the recap i doubt coldhands will save themcoldhands will save them but not from the white walker im guess that more wights and walkers show up after sam slays puddlesi dont see many problems with robbs will he could still write his will before the wedding though this could give too much away about the events during the red wedding since in the books robb writes his will in fear he could die while assaulting moat cailin and if in the future his heir turns out to be jon and if thats of any importance to the story it could just say so when its finally revealed wed miss robb and catelyns exchange over jon but with so much else missing that doesnt really seem important at allall the reasons he legitimizes jon are gone from the show or havent happened yet sansas wedding might be enough to prompt robb to legitimize jon though andor hearing about balons death this idea is sounding more and more reasonable to me please someone convince me that i must be wrong pleaseill try to convince you i guess they showed the scene with talisa and catelyn about catelyn already telling ned to call him stark and be done with itrobb will find out about sansas wedding to tyrion and the lannisters trying to claim the north in next episodeor the ninth i suppose which will prompt him into legitimizing jonif jon is a legitimate stark he is now his heir over sansa stark but not over his own sondaughter from talisa catelyn will probably be upset about losing sansaarya to the lannisters and give her show them how it feels to lose what they loveim quite sure the blackfish wont die now will he be sent with the will before entering the twins will he escape the massacre with talisa or alone or will he be taken captive i dont know the blackfish better not diei really wish for the first option and really fear the second one  i think it would diminish the impact if someone managed to escape the rwlike arya and the hound like greatjon and the other prisoners that the freys have from the rwmore than anything though i dont think they should cut away from switching between arya and the hound outside of the twins and robb catelyn and the rest inside at the wedding once theyve committed to starting the slaughterit wont happen like that spoiler i saw in a promo a brief shot of arya with the hound in what looked like a dungeon arya runs forward looking scaredworried and the hound grabs her by the shoulder and pulls her back basically the whole shot is one second but that one second is enough to figure out some thingsi believe that arya is going to get close enough to see the carnage unfold and the hound will have to retrain her from trying to save her mother and getting slaughtered herself"

"King Tommen",2013-05-18,"sam is not running into brans group one is south and one is north of the wall and we havent had queenscrown yeti think the post was referring to sam running into bran at some point this season presumably the finale because the s3 trailers show this taking place and if you arent going to show sam in e9 because they arent going to be covering off that many storylines in such an important episode then that means the coldhands meeting with sam needs to take place in e8 of course the synopsis this week confirms this is happening anyways so none of this should come as a surprise"
