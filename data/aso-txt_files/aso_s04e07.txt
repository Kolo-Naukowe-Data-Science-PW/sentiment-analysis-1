"franko99",2014-05-18,"first episode i didnt enjoy an aryahound scene the dialogue during the gift of mercy was cringeworthy and the random way rorge and bitter show up and die in 10 seconds was lame also the season is almost over and sandor hasnt even mentioned sansa not even once wtf â the eyrie scenes were great sophie was amazing as always but who is going to be framed for lysas death that little detail left me with a bad taste for what it could have been a great endingâ â brienne and pod whateverthere was hotpie best part of the episode â tyrionjaime and tyrionbronn were ok but i think bronn should have explained what the hell happen with shaeâ â oberyn was ok but once he started telling the story i was hoping they mention the reason why the martell went to casterly rock but theyre probably saving that for next episode â edit change my vote to 7â edited by franko99 18 may 2014  0915 pm"

"Ran",2014-05-18,"first 9 of the season for me the weakest stuff was either very brief the gregor scene which was just too cliche to take seriously or not all that weak at all mostly it was just kind of weird like the rorge scene where he just sort of stands there and has a chat and then dies im thinking sakharov is homaging something maybe something from kurosawa i keep thinking and the strong stuff was really really strong pedro pascal hits it out of the park in this one"
"tito5601",2014-05-18,"a 9 for me that was a great episode with lots of buildup i rlly enjoyed this ep the oberyn and tyrion scene was perfect makes us really want oberyn to get his revenge not only to save tyrions life but also for dorne"
"darksellsword",2014-05-18,"gave it an 8 would of given a 9 if it hadnt been for that ridiculous daario scene and i didnt like the hound confiding in arya like that it all felt a little rushed aswell i thought aidan gillen was very good in this episode cant understand for the life of me why they changed only cat to your sister"
"Nuts and Boltons",2014-05-18,"pedro and aidan killed it â"
"Fez",2014-05-18,"910 â which may be the highest ive given so far to an episode thats pretty much entirely setup however there were just too many incredibly strong scenes to go lower with oberyntyrion being the highlight"

"YourMomsBox",2014-05-18,"it was an episode that obviously didnt have too much action which is totally fine there wasnt a scene that i really rolled my eyes at or thought sucked the tyrionoberyn and lfsansalysa scenes were picture perfect imo i can see that there is backlash because the exact quote before lysa is thrown out the moon door isnt word for word doesnt bother me all that much only cat vs your sister is it that big of an issue"
"Darth Pipes",2014-05-18,"im going 10â ive been down on d and ds writing this season but they really came through in a big way hereâ they were bolstered by several of the performers including dinklage flynn pascal aiden turner and dickie"
"of man and wolf",2014-05-18,"i thought it was really good the dialogue how they put lines from other scenes in the books into these scenes good backstory for viewers to better understand things without slowing anything down top notch acting nothing at all bothered me the selyse and mel scene was whatever but im not as intrigued yet by their story arc"
"tallTale",2014-05-18,"gave it a 6 â the way the hound got injured was very weak not a fan of danys scenes either â thought they could have done a better job with lysas death â highlights were any of the tyrion scenes edited by talltale 18 may 2014  0905 pm"

"Howdyphillip",2014-05-18,"9  this was a fantastic episode peter dinkledge was tremendous throughout and rory mccann was fantastic â another nod to the lighting crew the dungeon scenes are some of the most complex work that can be shot and they are hitting it perfectly"
"Died a Hero",2014-05-18,"8 â liked everything but gravy talk and the bitter change for the life of me i will never understand why dd do things like this we know brienne is going to get jumped sometime this season and bite a mans ear off she said so in one the 1000 mini trailers before this season started but it wont be the bitter for some reason why not make the random guy the one who attack the hound and not the one that has an actual plot thread"

"Knight of Ashes",2014-05-18,"8 pretty much every scene had something interesting in it and nothing that made me wince tyrions scenes with jaime bronn and whatsisname viper dude were all well done seeing hot pie again was more welcome than i expected and im glad biter wont get to eat briennes face at least in the show maybe it was too convenient but i dont care i was a little taken aback at how long the kiss tween sansa and baelish lasted i daresay she was kissing back edited by knight of ashes 18 may 2014  0937 pm"
"OnlyOne",2014-05-18,"for all the ops who thought lf looked at sansa as a daughter i tried to tell you oh how i tried to tell you so glad lysa went out the moon door i thought the tyrionoberyn scene was terrific well the hound has his wound and arya will be on her way soon hot pie  eh nice but eh edited by onlyone 18 may 2014  0922 pm"
"jarl the climber",2014-05-18,"an 8 it was a good set up episode i sort of liked the dragonstone scene most people seemed meh with it but i thought there was some good stuff in there leaving shireen at dragonstone really does not make sense still the nonverbal communication was good arya and the hound was a little silly but they established a few things that were important the return of hot pie speaks for itself everything else was quite good except for the hammy scene with ser gregor but i guess they had too much fake blood laying around and it was nearing the expiration dateâ"
"Lady of Dragonstone",2014-05-18,"i gave this episode a 10 the second time this season i really enjoyed this episode i dont think there is a scene i can complain about â emilia clarke was absolutely radiant i loved the scene with her and michiel â rory mccann is the hound as ever i love him so much in the show and i will be sad to see him go i hope we see him again â the acting was so good in this episode im glad they stayed faithful to the books by including the snow castle sansa builds and the story oberyn tells about cersei its those little things that really enhance the character building for me i enjoyed seeing it translatedâ onto screen â as others said nicely setting up the story for later standout episode for me"

"Ran",2014-05-18,"this gregor might be a worse actor then the last two his one line made me cringe as the delivery was totally wrong but eh whatever â i think hes been dubbed bjarnsson has a very heavy icelandic accent in real life it may be the same person who dubbed ian white in s2 â so the delivery isnt necessarily his fault per se â and just to say it again pedro pascal was stunningly good i got goose bumps when he asked but what about what i want"
"OnlyOne",2014-05-18,"team dragonstone scene sucked but apart from that i liked itâ â 810 agreed makes me worry for shireen though"
"Ignorant Bog Woman",2014-05-18,"every single scene was so good ill be more descriptive after a rewatch â id say 910 â best episode of the season so far"

"dmo862000",2014-05-18,"one complaint biter scene was kind of ridiculous aside from that amazing especially for a setup episode season 4 for me has dare i say it equaled and possibly surpassed grrm as far as quality overall is concerned okay so for this episode i dont recall sweet robin getting slapped in the books its been awhile and i could have just completely forgotten but either way great oberyntyrion great scene love the casterly rock recall initial jaime and tyrion scene was great as well bronn made me uncomfortable in his new clothes and demeanor but by the time it was all said and done its possibly the most heart touching moment you could get between a mercenary with no morals and a narcissistic overentitled dwarf without seeming forced hot pie nuff said i thought brienne talking about sansa by name was stupid and loved that pod called her out on it even if she was right jorah changing daenerys mind was also rather swell imo no complaints here the complaint of petyr calling her sister instead of cat makes sense as its a show and it makes it easier to understand for show watchers its imo more of a decomplicating of things more than anything else for viewersâ"
"Sir Dominus",2014-05-18,"wouldve been a 9 if they didnt rush the moondoor scene and change the only cat line"

"boojam",2014-05-18,"i did not expect by the book  rearanged as it is  that is the kl stuff was by the book and the eyrie condensed but by the bookaryas story oddly modified but was fine with me  seems the arya scene should been constructed a little differently  the killing seemed awkard ok but too suddenben hawkey saw no warning about his appearancebrienness story fine by me but where is it goingto bad not more time at castle black they didnt have itmarking time at meereen clarke was very good this episodea dd episode well done see they can do italas a two week break"

"Lady Sansa's Direwolf",2014-05-18,"loved the 3 jail visits jamie least of the three oberyn the best bronn seemed as uncomfortable with the discussion as he did in his new clothes he knows hes selling out but what can he do but oberlyn if there was a nearly flawless delivery this episode it was what about what i want the depth of his pain really shone through something that hasnt happened a lot with all his banter â meh on the mountain hes the right body for the job talking is optional imo â the eryie was too short and felt rushed while i enjoyed the stop at the inn and the surprise meeting with hot pie i would have preferred less gravy though i laughed at the moment and more crazy lysa and the sansapetyr scenes gave an appropriate creepy conspiratorial tone little robin deserved the slap but i though sansas anger was a little much but it might have been the delivery â overall a solid 85 out of 10 one of the best setup episodes of the series if only it had been ten minutes longerâ"
"Queen Elsa",2014-05-18,"awesome episode and i dont want it to end but it still did cant wait for the next one â i give it a 810â"
"A Man Reads",2014-05-18,"910 were building up to the end now â likes tyrion and bronn what a fabulous sequence the hounds confession you confess before you    sansa and robert arrynâ using hot pie wasnt big on how they used him but still saves considerable time they left dragonstone off the credits and melisandre said shireen must come with them were going to be left hanging until they arrive the small details are what makes the show wonderful transitioning from daarios rearguard to melisandres van houten guard was a nice touch also the hound getting    bitten i like that dany is in for a descent edit and i loved how they mixed in tyrions three jail visitors dislikes the first houndarya two swords scene could have been skipped the gift of mercy part was nice killing rorge was nice  but weve had both of these already i wondered if the two houndarya scenes were originally set for different episodes ghost at the wall i get that the wolves are cgi and inserted but hes off standing on his own and it looks terrible edited by a man reads 18 may 2014  0958 pm"

"Queen of Whores",2014-05-19,"a very solid 7 out of 10 definitely my favourite episode of this season and the one ive rated the highest i didnt like arya daenerys or briennes scenes though aryas little monologue about nothing was really dumb and cringeworthy and trying to be deep and meaningful but it fell flat to me and seemed like it was trying to hard im also wondering how exactly arya is going to do what she does soon with sandor seeing as how their relationship seems much more caring and mutual now this doesnt work also what exactly is going on with yunkai jorah and daario so does this mean jorahs fate will be different to that of the novels and with briennes scenes i dont know something seems off about her she seems much more loud and snarky than normal i prefer the quiet and shy brienne of the books but whatever although i mourn the loss of what seems to be nearly all of herâ feastâ storyline which i actually liked it was pretty funny having hot pie have a little cameo and for once dd seem to be showing a little bit of continuity between seasons which has been sorely lacking this season oh and emilia is still a really bad actress im sorry i cant believe she has the same tone when ordering a guy to strip that she does while holding court she has no range sad to say i also thought that scene should have been built up more and its weird that after all the needless and gratuitous sex in this show they dont show this one one that is arguably more relevent than most the show has done and im not just saying that cause i wanted to see emilia naked again okay well a bit of me is the melisandre scene made up for it though even though other than carices beautiful body the scene was rather forgettable i would have rather had a stannis scene also the jon scene was ridiculously redundant and pointless and really didnt need to be there all it did was establish yarwick sp as a character which while im glad for this scene still really was unnecessary we get it alliser thorne is an asshole â but thats enough of the negatives now to the positives and this episode there were quite a few big ones for me first of all im ridiculously happy they kept the tyrion and bronn farewell scene very accurate i was very surprised they bothered keeping in lollys and falyse and bronns marriage and new lordship i loved that little subplot he got in the books and im very glad they are keeping it in the show unlike tyrions other farewell scene with pod which i thought was very cheesy and sappy and dumb i thought this one was done excellently i alsoâ lovedâ the oberyn and tyrion scene nowâ thatâ is how a long conversation is done dd no cheese no sentimentality just straight up good dialogue and acting although i must give grrm all the credit here since i was very hopeful the show would include the casterly rock visit story so im really happy they did the bit where oberyn tells tyrion ive come to the perfect place was really awesome and finally convinced me this guy is the only guy for oberyn and of course finally the eyrie scene was fantastic and just as good as i hoped for everything was perfectly done from the beautiful snowcovered eyrie to sansas winterfell to sansa slapping robin a change i really liked littlefinger reminding us hes a creep and then the great final scene with the moondoor all was done amazingly and i have no complaintsâ â wow i honestly think this is the first episode of season 4 ive come away from really satisfied i want to rate this episode an 8 but the unremarkable first three quarters hold me back the final fifteen minutes though were incredible and the best parts of this season so far by a long shot hopefully this momentum is kept up for the final three episodes which im sure it will beâ â spoiler im going to be very sad to see oberyn go though this episode really convinced me of the actors brilliance in the role which i was hesitant towards previously edited by queen of whores 19 may 2014  0235 am"

"Prince of the North",2014-05-19,"first 9 of the season for me the weakest stuff was either very brief the gregor scene which was just too cliche to take seriously or not all that weak at all mostly it was just kind of weird like the rorge scene where he just sort of stands there and has a chat and then dies im thinking sakharov is homaging something maybe something from kurosawa i keep thinking and the strong stuff was really really strong pedro pascal hits it out of the park in this one i gave this episode a 10â thats mainly because its the first time this season that i literally said to myself as the episode was ending finallyâ an episode that i dont have major nitpicks withâ i agree with you about gregorâ if anything that scene had the opposite effect than was intended for meâ rather than being scary it was laughableâ gregor is imposing enough just sitting in a chair  there was no need to have him slaughtering untrained smallfolk â â i also agree with you about pedro pascalâ i thought that was a great scene â i havent read the whole thread so forgive me if this has already been discussed ad nauseumâ but what do people think about rorge and biter being killedâ in this epâ does that add support to the idea that lady stoneheart may be written out of the showâ or at the very least thatâ much of briennes feast for crows activities will be skippedâ"

"lord ross of house stark",2014-05-19,"where was marimillion when lysa went flying"
"Beric175",2014-05-19,"910 just for bronn the hound oberyn tyrion sansaâ and even littlefinger all hitting it right out of the park with their performances all the sansa stuff this year has been very well done and while ive seen some unsullied complain about sansa getting bratty again over just a snow castle i can seethat all the anger that has built up in her under joffrey she unleashes onto sweetrobin who while not exactly a 100â douche like joffrey is being very arrogant and douchey at least in the moment while he is right that a small tower is no big deal and that he did not ruin it he still was petulant and impulsively aggressive when she lashed out at him in one sense i cannot totally condemn him but i can understand sansa more given her present situation and the awareness that she has of it in general i could see that when he came to her she wanted to be alone with her memories of a sweeter time and the moment was ultimately ruined by him showing up at all given that he so nonchalantly talked to her about her familys death the moment they met it frustrates me a little that the subtle scanes with sansa that are open to interpretation are usually reduced by the unsullied viewers as bratty teenage behavior not considering that she has had a rough time at the vry least recently with being aware of peoples belief as to her implication in joffreys death the death of ser dontos who she arguably saved from death and the destruction of winterfell that we are always reminded of in the opening credits because it is a permanent thing to her as well and its tough to get over a loss like that one i think we can take away from this that sansa is starting to stand up for herself more just because shes done dealing with petty little psychos like joffrey and robert â now littlefingers move here is interesting not just because we are not sure if he is expressing feelings for sansa in the book for catelyn or if he is even expressing any true feelings at all here given that having lysa freak out over this kiss and he knows that robert will go straight to her to bring her here and try to have sansa killed is the perfect way for him to act on what we already suspected in episode 5 his absolute distaste for lysa that he only puts up with because it allows him to marry into a powerful family with control over a region as of yet untouched by the warâ he will be lord protector of the vale once she dies so either its a fit of passion in which case he forgot himself with sansa which goes against much of what we know of this calm and usually careful man or it was a planned move to provoke in lysa exactly the kind of reaction she ended up having i also would like to point out that lysa implicates herself in the deaths of sansas mother and sansas uncle jon so the confession scenario came about in a different way for which i am very gratefulâ i dont even mind them leaving out only cat because thats them putting their spin on the story and it changes nothing between him here and the books if he says your sister the effect is the same and apart from a nod to the books nothing gets lost â i didnt think wed get oberyn telling the story of tyrion as a baby but it was wellwritten wellacted and wellplaced because tyrion is in a tough spot right now and both this jaimesâ and bronns scenesâ were wonderful in communicating his growing despair so that when oberyn offers his service to tyrion its a wonderful moment of hopethat will get crushed in 2 weeks sadly and i will be very sad because pedorâ pascal martin and the writers for the showâ have made him an excellent character on the show and treated the character with a lot of respect which i am very thankful for â the jon scene once again emphasises what a bully alliser thorne is to everyone around him and it is a good way to build the tension because we know that in episode 9 a giant will come running though that tunnel and well go had you guys just paid a bit more heed to jons warnings â i never thought reading affc that brienne was brilliant and its nice to see that she sort of has to rely on pod to some extent and the inconsistencies like her asking for sansa stark in public are pointed out as a bad approach by pod later so it makes him more useful because otherwise brienne does not really need him so it justifies his presence anyone else thinks its like sancho panza and don quixote â the arya and the hound scenes were both fine even thoughâ i would have preferred seeing brienne dispose of rorge and biter but whatever at least the hound got wounded badly enoug to die of the festering wound in the next episode its also great to have the hound tell his own story and we at least now know the fathers involvement in all of this which mirrors tywins treatment of tyrion when compared to jaime something tyrion even points outat the beginning and we can already see that he is getting insulting with both bronn and jaime to some extent for now he will still hold back to some extent but once jaime reveals the tysha bit well get the more questionable and angry tyrion for sure â the only slight misstep was the melisandre scene but it added flavour to characters who we otherwise never see interact and the nudity would not be a problem for selyse other than the fact that she might be jealous of melisandre or was the idea of mel talking about magic tricks and illusions mixed with the image of her youthful body meant as a nod towards her glamour since she is actually using magic to keep herself younger than she actually is â is it wrong thatâ i enjoy cersei walking though the guts of dead prisoners nb the new mountain is huuuuge"
"Pablosplinter",2014-05-19,"7 all of the tyrion stuff was excellent the brienne scene was quite good the wall i didnt like mel scene was poor and useless â getting sick of aryahound just wasting time â disappointed with the end as only cat would have been much more epic imo"

"DolorousKim",2014-05-19,"this episode had quite a few crucial scenes and the pressure was on the show to deliver in an epic fashionâ in my opinion they completely nailed every one of the key scenesâ i rated this episode a 10 the first perfect score that ive given since season twos blackwaterâ this is my favorite episode so far this season and is easily in my top 10 perhaps top 5 for the series overall â what really really worked for me â my top slot has to go to the tyrionbronn farewell scene  this scene is my building the snow winterfell scene so i was really anxious for the show to get this one right i can happily state that i was not disappointed in the leastâ both dinklage and flynn were perfect in their performances  the emotional level was subtly and deftly built throughout the scene both verbally and nonverbally the awkward body language and lack of the trademark smirk on bronns part for exampleâ by the end the scene succeeded in conveying the fact that the two shared a friendship far beyond the employermercenary relationship that they started out with and did so without descending into cheesy oversentimentalityâ i was actually more moved by the show scene than by the book scene which is not something that i find myself saying often my second slot goes to the oberyntyrion cell visit  is peter dinklage having a great year or whatâ his performances for the past two weeks have exceeded my ability to come up with new descriptive superlativesâ and the best partâ pedro pascal absolutely matched the lofty level of dinklages performance every step of the wayâ great great scene my third slot goes to the aryahound scenes  ive said it before and ill undoubtedly say it again before this season is out but the dynamics of the houndarya relationship are probably my favorite of the whole show this seasonâ to me these two are like fierce warriors from opposing tribes  they respect each other even have some regard for each other but at the end of the day they are on different sides and cant ever really be allies in the long termâ maisie williams and rory mccann were superb yet again this weekâ unlike what others have stated above i really enjoyed the gift of mercy scene even if it was a shade less strong than the scene featuring the hounds confession of how he received his injury at the hands of his brotherâ i also thought that whoever the gentleman was that played the dying man did a wonderful job with his portrayalâ both scenes really pushed the correct emotional buttons for me my fourth slot goes to the sansapeterrobinlysa scene  despite a few minor changes minor to me anyway i really thought that the show did justice to an incredibly powerful set of scenes from the bookâ aidan gillens performance has has gotten a lot of criticism on this site but i thought that he was wonderfully creepy and pitchperfect as pervy peter this weekâ kate dickie is so damn convincing as crazy lysa that if i ever should happen to bump into this actress walking down the street in real life i would probably cross to the other side my fifth slot goes to jaimes visit to tyrion  like peter dinklage nikolaj costerwaldau is also having a stellar year and through the performances of these two this scene really drove home just how desperate life has gotten for the lannister boys and just how desolate of hope the unfolding of events have become for them as wellâ it also served as a reminder of how strong the bond of brotherhood has remained between these twoâ wonderful scene my sixth and final slot goes to iain glen for delivering a stupendous rendition of why you just cant kill all of the slavers that you seeâ its about time that the actor got to sink his chops into some real dialogue for a changeâ he was so good that he all but blasted emilias onenote badass teenaged conquerorqueen vocal inflection out of my memory and saved the meereen scene from being laughably bad what didnt work for me the only criticism that i have regards emilia clarkes sudden inability to change her vocal inflection regardless of the nature of the dialogue that shes deliveringâ whether shes trying to seduce a sellsword or asking for advice from her most trusted friend everything sounds like shes issuing an order in a tone of voice thats overcompensating for the fact that shes just a clueless young woman who no one would follow if she didnt have dragonsâ weve seen her perform far far better in the past so what givesâ its like were right back to her second season performance which was a huge step back from her first season performance but where she at least had the excuse that she had nothing to do but wander around in the wastelands spewing about being the blood of the dragon etc etc"

"Lord Spark of House Spark",2014-05-25,"first the gripes i liked the scene with arya and the hound with the old man but it was spoiled by the pathetic ending of it with rorge and biter these two were of the three most dangerous prisoners in kings landing according to an ssm they set up an illegal fighting pit with biter as the main attraction biter has a ton of experience of fighting and killing in brawl type of fights i really cant believe he had his neck snapped that easily why would rorge just stand there after that with his sword dangling by his side they knew how dangerous the hound wasâ even if he wasnt expecting arya to stab him like that it didnt happen very fast so why did he make no attempt to protect himselfâ i appreciate that they needed to give the hound his injury and i can see how the bite would get him back to where he and arya parted company in the books but the whole fight was incredibly poorly scripted and choreographed far below quality for the show â it was howeverâ made to look like a work of genius compared to the season introduction of the mountain who rides perhaps oberyn could dress as popeye the sailor man and eat some spinach before the fight it was always the best way to defeat bluto in the old cartoons â i agree with previous posters about the lack of chemistry between dany and daario jon at the wal seemed entirely filler as if he has a minimum screen time per episode clause in his contract mels nude scene was not necessary to further the plot in any way she looked fabulous but it was completely gratuitous â i think the snow castle scene was handled really well yes they could have dragged it out a bit more showing sansas frustration at not getting it quite right but sophie would have to be an expert ice carver to make it convincing aiden gillen finally got the chance to show what a great actor he is the kiss was just great perfectly creepy and sophie turner portrayed it so that you could not really tell if she welcomed it or not if grrm doesnt get wow out before season 5 starts we will be deep into spoiler territory next year with sansa the moon door scene could have benefitted from being a bit longer closer to the books withâ the explaination of how hoster had nearly killed her with theâ moon tea it would have gone some way to explaining to the unsullied how she got to be so crazy and given a bit more sympathy at the only cat momentâ i didnt mind it being changed to your sister i never realised it was an iconic line until i read this forum â all of tyrions scenes were great 8 12 out of ten highest mark so far for me edited by lord spark of house spark 25 may 2014  0547 pm"

"Ser Creighton",2014-05-18,"i liked the dany scene she is sliding more and more into crusader land and her crazy targ side shows a bit and jorah is the moral compass more then anyone else because trusts him the scene when he is kicked out should be quote emotional you think jorah is the moral compass thats interesting did you actually listen to what jorah said i am sure you heard it but did you listen jorah has his history even on the show jorah thinks selling slaves is ok he has made excuses for it he is indignant about what ned stark did slavery is one of those things that is not really grey its pretty black and white buy the unsullied sell slaves its all good if it gets him what he wants betray his lord betray his father betray viserys betray dany which i think this is the setup for jorah wants dany and now darrio is in the way this will probably lead to the falling out but a moral compass how so we know from the books that jorah got some first hand and much needed lessons in slavery and he didnt like it in fact he seems pretty pro kill the shit out of the slavers these days he knows he has been an idiot that he has a problem admitting his mistakes and tends to blame everyone else its his wifes fault neds fault the slaves fault it is always someone else well at least pre get the boot jorah but a moral compass people with a moral compass do not buy and sell slaves and betray everyone around them jorah wanted easy money to continue to try and buy his wifes love so he sold some poachers got busted and refused to admit what he did was wrong or take responsibility for his actions just like he couldnt except that selling secrets about dany was betraying her i like the character but he has his issues like the rest of them probably why i like him though i guess it depends on your compass i am sure some people think kidnapping 300 girls is morally ok or they would of never done it and when someone puts a bullet in the kidnappers heads i am going to feel totally fine about it i am quirky like that to be clear i dont think you think slavery is ok just using a real world example of something most people are rather heavily offended by you know someone could argue maybe its like disney land for the 276 girls still abducted i am more of the mind they probably would rather go home seems the more logical thought than happy slaves who like being kidnapped and god knows what else"

"Tyrion1991",2014-05-19,"i thought the dany scenes were a mixed bagâ â it was good to see her relationship with daario and this cause tension between her and jorah this is what happens in the books â also i totally called it on jorah being a member of the golden companyâ â the problem i had is that they start arguing by about his disapproval and rather than calling out the heart of the issue jorah is jealous and loves her like she does in the book it sort of drifts into a morality lesson about the slavers so we end up having a totally different conversation it felt very odd and jarring almost as if they wrote this as two separate scenes and then decided to mash them together you could say that dany and the audience are fully aware why jorah does not approve of daario but in the books dany is much more direct and blunt with jorah over this issue jorah comes across more as a disapproving father figure than being jealous of danys lover really dany shouldnt entertain such a facade and would confront him with the real reason for his objectionsâ â also it does really feel rather late in the day to be having jorah act jealous around daario especially since he shouldnt even be in meereen at this pointâ â â plus and i was reserving judgement from a previous scene but the show has made it much clearer now in â the books dany makes the decision to act defensively to turn away from war and does not attempt to nip the yunkish problem in the bud she could have done this many many reviewers and readers of adwd would say that she was weak and made many mistakes in not confronting the slavers directly early on this is a huge deviation from the books and frankly is an attempt to shift blame dd is aware that danys adwd arc took flack for her being weak and vaciliating with her inaction so they are putting this down to jorahs bad advice which makes her follow the path of weakness when in the novels jorah tells her to get out of dodgetwiceonce as a ghost he does not tell her to be gentle with the slavers it also creates a huge problem going forward when jorah gets exiled why on earth would dany continue to follow his prior advice and stay in meereen to rule as a queen peacefully surely she would adopt a warlike path of violence as is her clear and obvious preference on the show without jorah telling her otherwise unless they continue to alter danys adwd arc the show could end up with really muddying the waters about danys behavior and actionsâ edited by tyrion1991 19 may 2014  1041 am"

loaned a vast sum of gold to achieve victory from the iron bankâ were we so stupid to assume that the lannisters forge gold because their last gold mine has run out not any of the other associated ores mined alongside gold like copper iron tin etc these ores which are turned into goldcurrency the iron bank will lend to stannis even though there has been no formal defaults from the new king tommen or from his council previously when ignored by an angry mother in time of immediate war the battle of the black water how does this new event from iron bank prevent further interaction with the nights watch in later plot the wildlings settling in the gift castles maintained food stores ships stannis is now preummed that other banker who will loan for the crisis upcoming he rererucited salandor saan navyâ presumed as still docking at dragonstone for payment oops forgotten for this other attempted schemes hole â what is wrong with deanerys acting so rarely is she seen as subtle seductive in much of a manner of the stately elegant queen often perceived through speech as an angry kid yes she has dragons her lines in expression have mostly been forced when showing her entirely as argumentative when she is coy sounding childlike with goofish smirks almost in duplication of a cersei whom has a reason to be angry and vehement although deanerys looks pretty and smiles sure but that is not really the entire point â where in meereen is the opposite of the westerosi throne chamber in holding hosting court that is entirely empty devoid of anyone but her own guardsmen the queens private quarters looked like a japanese bubble apartment being a tiny little bedroom with a futon not that 4 poster luxurious penthouse housing scenic views of the entire city with adjacent water gardens handmaidens unsullied guards bodyguard bloodriders â having one of the best fight scenes in game of thrones currently with some nobody cutthroat in the prior episode when removing the remaining deserters of the nights watch from castors keep so great a fight in fact the cut throat didnt even cut a throat previous to this epic melee when holding onto a hostage â the whitewalkers who were at the fist of the first men now are resorting to baby knapping to replenish their numbers over the huge army seen previously which forced a retreat of the nights watch back into castors further making castors keep immune to any later annihilation from offering baby sacrifices to appease because the white army has not been scavenging the corpse trail leading back to castors â wildlings are roaming free outside of castle black unchecked because they cannot read any sign posts scouting from mole town in the previous raid which informed the watch via the boy observing any nights watch forces within the black castle attacking at the best opportunity when fighting men are out ranging those same men of the watch have not netrualised the immediate wildling threat because they are in fear worried about a fight coming with mances wildling army this fight will happen upon any events depsite of any pointless information obtained from deserters â everybody killed jeffrey who really killed jeffrey was it lady tyrell or littlefinger not the imp though these two separate groups and motives have said explictaly they did it cersei has had conversation with margaery accepting the loss of her little monster how quick to remarry her other son whom she cannot guard from the imps guilt â is esos really accross the chunnel close enough to be housing varys little birds these birds have been shown as everywhere from white harbour iron islands etc not taking the years to travel to and fro between when showing those same years at times throughout the season for tommen to age into an adolescent arya to gain the pounds dragons to fledgethey have often been in the next sceens ordered to act out some grand westrosi schemes now against deanerys why is their information being brought to light of huge stately importance to the small councils present state with no other real immediate issues addressed such as budget present conflict etc small mention of ships because accross the chunnel is a queen who has dragons quickly send more spies to what manipulate jorah into betrayal inform of selemy but cmon now varys later role was what exactly â asha theon and the bastard ashas grand quest to capture her brother theon ending in tears asha was just at the iron islands beforehand being chided not to get her brother from her father the king of the ironborn asha has not managed to capture reek because he is needed at moat calin being ordered by roose bolton to be used to retake previously now after present events a reward asha could not knock reek out carrrying his hobbling husk when attempting escape forgetting to silence the dogs barking alerting the guards there was aâ plot hole in the rescue attempt the ironborn were trapped said by her guardsmen there is only one way in what are her options now try again after claiming that reek is no longer her brother try to kill the bastard at a different opportunity because forgotten during attempted rescue disappear again back into torhen square which is already occupied by ironborn shown from the bastards ruse with theon prior go and get more men whom she didnt bring on her quest go home with his tail between her legs â the imp has been absolutely moppy outside of his haircut this entire season although shown to be happier in jail with poddrick now back to being moppy again his speech at the trial was outstandingly epic though and with given congradulation the great actor playing this role having so much persona in former seasons when winning award is so unnaturally glum of late desipte any affecting circumstances within this show â the red priestess setting her sights on shireen is this an assumed spoiler for her next sacrifice in some seasons away build up that because grey scale is not attributed to rhllor shireen must be burned for kings blood why is this information of any particular note seen in plot for a few episodes of late â i would be here all day litterally if continuing picking apart the lack of details shown within so many sceens examples showing bloodwax magically appearing on the bastard prior to the rescue attempt a shepherd boy not being burned from a tsunami of dragon fire on top of him the most pointlessly ridiculous crucifixion executions seen any where on tv serving only to force out hammy moaning groans which did not replicate a sign post rather would

expressed as coherent â stannis meets the iron bank the iron bank loans money to stannis to achieve total victory in westeros sit the iron throne stannis after being granted a vast sum of money but he doesnt recruit any more men particularly any sell swords these sell swords of whom we have heard about in the show from westeros origins as well as from deanerysthe north really really needs stannis it was seen in the flames so instead stannis rerecruiteds that same whoring pirate who he had already hired previously the iron bank lends stannis the money the reason for the loan being stannis is a real straight edge what he says he does banker go beg somewhere else i have a finger for you the iron bank had never tried to press any payment from the current king tommen and his council instead we were offered a ridiculous notion the lannisters are broke because they do not forge any more gold the last nugget of theirs was mined out years ago are we from planet stupid assuming that they actually farmed minted their gold not smelting the various irons to trade for gold the realm and the realms council has not presently defualted on any sums owed a prior petition was ignored from cersei during the battle of the blackwater a time of immediate war if varys has little birds everywhere you can bet your bottom dollar that the iron bank has twice as many debtors being well aware of current events particularly which houses sit the kings council the gold they produce between them which taxes can be raised what stores they have however what was shown was not at all coherent to concepts rather some hammy pomp a great speech on how to get a loan if you have got really poor credit begging the obvious question of why this information was necessary the way this will play out stannis will likely give the money to the nights watch for food and their upcoming crisis had this interaction come after kings landing this seasons events maybe it would have played out so much better why if stannis has gold doesnt he go somewhere else hiring more men not the north the flames are not reallyâ so relevant now the ending war take a wall at a time the furthest from the throne

go and kill the traitors at castors samwell sends gilly to mole town to a brothel to stop any rape at castle black but all the borthers frequent that brothel anyway meanwhile the wildings over the wall have been joined by some real cannibals pillaging what is assumed as mole town leaving a boy to run and tell the watch what has just happened but instead the bothers ignore this threat within walking distance of a childâ riding to castors keep because the traitors demand the watchs justice and they are 60 miles away 60 miles back these traitors if caught will give information about castle black this information must be how to climb a wall hand book the fact all the other castles along the wall are not in use but we already knew this because wildlings have been climbing the wall for yearsthe other castles tunnels are sealed in with a wildling climbing a wall you would have thought they would have used a door first well they are wildlings but i get it because the traitors will say how many men the nights watch have at castle blackâ this information wont prevent the upcoming war no matter what useless numbers are revealed the cutthroat was such an epic character who got shafted in the back because he couldnt cut a hostages throat whom was headlocked thankfully the best melee yet although within obvous error to the above jon gets his guard dog back a dog that now attacks its captors when previously was all like good boy anyhow the watch are now back at castle black all is well in the north when preparing for mance now the other wildling can attack castle black because jon

"Newstar",2014-05-22,"id like to attribute a lot more weight to aryas twow killing finding its way into season 4 since that means that dd must have seen that chapter before the spring of 2013 when they were writing season 4 but that arya chapter has been languishing for a long time much like the sansa chapter that doesnt speak to new material just to very old material that was sitting around that hasnt found its way into the books yet â using the arya chapter or the bumped sansa chapter or the other bumped chapters from adwd as evidence that a lot of twow stuff is finished makes no sense to me as they are leftover chapters from adwd and if indeed grrm had most of jons stuff done 10 years before adwds release thats another indication theres not that much proximity in terms of time between grrm finishing a lot of stuff on a novel and its completion and release edited by newstar 22 may 2014  0838 am"

reflective of a lack of understanding of women etc etcnot to mention those who despite their otherwise allconsuming love for the books find themselves infuriated by grrms repetitive use of

explained why wench wouldnt work for the adaptation a few times in fact its incredibly campy in a show where the writers have deliberately tried to tone down the camp in the source material its associated in modern times with medieval times and ren faires and just because something works on the page doesnt mean it will work on screen your argument seems to boil down to i think it would have worked in the show because i think its super great in the books which is fine but is no argument and i think it would have worked in the show because everyone always loves it when book dialogue is used which is not even true and would not be verifiable even if true â as for your claim that a toneddown bluepronged beard would have worked as jaqens hair worked theres just no way neither michiel huisman nor ed skrein is hot enough to pull that off without looking like an idiot i dont think theres any man alive thats hot enough to pull that off not even johnny depp could have made jack sparrows beard braids work if his hair had been blue if youre sufficiently gorgeous and charismatic you can pull off a normal hairstyle with a goofy colour jaqen or you can pull off a goofy hairstyle with a normal hair colour drogo oberyn cant have it both ways â when it comes to sandorsansas bedroom assault you can go right on thinking that it would have been more interesting but that doesnt mean the decision to leave it out wasnt the right one on the page its one thing on the screen moral event horizon for sandor interestingly the show includes an attempted gang rape which had the sandor assault been left in would have further highlighted the awfulness of his act in the books it never got as far as sansa pinned on the ground but its made pretty clear that she would have been raped as well had the hound not intervened instead tv sandor chides arya about there being men out there who want to rape little girls referring specifically to the attempted rape of sansa in the show which is especially rich in light of book sandor pinning sansa on her bed at knifepoint and later admitting to arya that he meant to rape take but in context it clearly refers to rape her theres also that scene in 4x01 where in the tv version the goons are shown to be rapists and child molesters no doubt to differentiate them from tv sandor who while also a killer and a thug is shown to be disgusted by their behaviour because he of course would never contemplate such a thing its not particularly subtle of coursevery few things on the show arebut its a change that makes a lot of sense especially since the writers seem to view committing or attempting rape as the defining quality of worthless scum whose deaths we cheer on in the show the rioters sandor kills the mutineers killed at crasters keep the lannister soldiers at the inn the stark soldiers brienne kills etc etc i think part of the reason the attempted gang rape on sansa went as far as it did is so that the audience would cheer on the deaths of the rioters as opposed to feeling conflicted about sandor killing them if they had just been jostling sansa around a little or trying to pull on her arm sandor coming in and killing all of them wouldnt have had the same hell yeah flavour as it wouldnt be visually clear that they were scum who needed to die you could still infer that they intended to rape sansa but it wouldnt be as viscerally clear as it was with sansa being held down while one of them fumbled with his pants if rapes your main tool to differentiate between scum and nonscum then youre going to want to avoid showing your nonscum character pinning a female child character hes in love with on a bed at knifepointbecause that visual speaks for itselfand scrub any whiff of it from a character you want to be viewed as nonscum which is why the jaimecersei fiasco in 4x03 mystified me but thats another matter so tv sandor only ever lays a hand on sansa to prevent her from shoving joffrey and to rescue her from the riot where he implicitly requests her consent by holding out his hand to help her to stand and keeps a respectful distance from her and her bed at all times during the bedroom scene except to get in her face a little at the end of it without touching her makes sense â since this is the nitpick with impunity thread though i will bitch about sansa still wearing her very lannister ring im not even sure if its supposed to be a wedding ring or not since wedding rings are not a thing in westeros but at any rate that ring screams lannister tacky huge gold and red colours and i dont understand why sansa hasnt ditched it since 1 she hates the lannisters 2 her time in kl was traumatizing and i doubt she would want to have a constant reminder of it every time she looked at her hand and 3 shes in hiding supposedly concealing her identity and the ring is a big honking clue as to that identity edited by newstar 22 may 2014  0745 am"

"Bear Island",2014-05-19,"its hard to know what to make of the scene but it cant be called a spoiler maybe mel just meant shireen is important and is needed as stannis heir but the talk about sacrifice and nothing being a sin if its in service of god sure makes it seem like mel is intending on burning her the thing is as everyone has mentioned stannis would never allow that maybe it happens behind his back but i cant see him ever allowing it or being okay with it if it were done behind his back i agree with seventyseven that scene to me felt like selyse was sizing up mel and was jealousenvious of the qualities mel possesses that stannis apparently finds attractive i didnt for a minute see any desire there"

"Gendels Children",2014-05-19,"imo the whole we need to keep your daughter with us because she is important for the future thing is quite vague yet unsettlingly clear that she wishes to burn herthat is why it wont happen unsullied and book readers alike can easily pick up on the idea of burning her for her kings blood in order to serve some higher purpose which is exactly why i think it wont happen its too obvious and right now dd are getting into a subject that has not been dictated clearly by the books yet its in essences a project all their own they are going to want to do this the best way possible though i know not everyone willhas agreed with their methods i think they are really going to try avoid spoilers or overly clear hints unless they are leading you into the wrong direction i think this little statement about about shireens upcoming necessary role she has to play will have more to do with like others have said her greyscale its built up rather big in the 5th book the wildlings know a lot about greyscale and they know to steer clear of anyone inflicted with it they distrust and fear it to the point of killing children who have been cursed with it i very much doubt this has just been brought to ourand jons attention at such a crucial time for no reason at all that being said anything can just be a great big red herring in this particular realmâ"

"Lord Varys",2014-05-20,"ive already said it that scene could just be in there to explain whythat selyse and shireen  who did not leave dragonstone before when stannis fought his battles  will now accompany him if mel had said something like dragonstone will soon fall after we have left or stannis fears that shireen might end up in the hands of the lannisters if she remains on the island then the audience would know that stannis is not going to try to attack the lannisters they gave the impression that this is his plan now after he has learned that joffrey was killed â its actually very likely that mel has just told selyse what she wanted to hear  or rather made her accept a fact that shireen will come with them by saying her what she needed to her that rhllor had a plan for shireen and that this was the reason why she is accompanying them when in fact stannis may just have decided that his daughter and heir will come with him because he does not expect to return to dragonstone at allin the foreseeable future it would actually be completely stupid to leave her there but again  they could not mention that in the show if they intended to keep the illusion alive that they were fighting the lannisters â we know get the ominous feeling that shireen may be used as sacrifice to do whatever melisandre intended to do with gendry to win stannis throne but that really is not the case â im pretty sure they are not foreshadowing anything from twow in the show here nor is it very likely that the selyse loathing her daughter is going to lead to anything they seem to be using that thing  among others  to explain why stannis grew estranged from his wife he seemed to have cared for selyse once during the siege of storms end but in the books selyse really loves and cares for her daughter she will not allow that she as sacrificed this thought does also never cross melisandres mind in her chapter  in fact she is actually a much nicer person in her pov than people have imagined she respects davos and tries to protect his son devan i really dont see her trying to kill stannis only child"

"Ser Oromus Locke",2014-05-19,"if they wanna end the show after 7 season they will need to cut some stuff out and if the hound doesnt play a big part in twow and ados i could see them kill him off now instead of having him become the gravedigger brienne is likely to meet lady stoneheart this season so she wont stumble upon the gravedigger either right now i feel that there is a strong possibility well be seeing the last of the hound this seasonâ â theres definitely that chance but with the current season wrapping up theres just so many actorscharacters leaving temporarily  joffrey dies  olenna leaves kl never to return  tywin is going to leave a huge gap unless kevan returns to the show immediately  shae thank god she will be gone  bronn hasnt returned to the fold but might become cerseis kettleblack which would be awesome for reasons below  varys until he returns at the end of season 5beginning of season6  lysa lol almost forgotten her already  rorgebiter not really missed but i anticipated him and biter tackling brienne so im a bit upset  polliver who am i kidding xd  sandor   grenn  â im sure im missing quite a few â bronn as we know the kettleblacks are hired by bronn to spy on cersei for tyrion little does tyrion know that the kettleblacks are actually littefingers men so we have tyrion having men in his employ of which he isnt aware that theyre actually loyal to littlefinger both book and show bronn have gone to cersei and have married with lollys theres really no reason why cersei cant say to bronn can you kill the high septon for me it even makes sense for the books because she wants bronn dead as well â but to the point i wanted to make the kettleblacks are in littlefingers service in order to spy on cersei and tyrion where do we meet bronn for the very first time exactly at the time where cat and tyrion meet and the beginnings of the war start bronn as a littlefinger employee would require a lot of work and belief but it could be the caselittlefinger sticking a man that close to tyrion for the entirety of his chaosplan simply removing him when he effectively does not need tyrion anymore sure you can call it bronns own agency but you can see where littlefinger gains from having bronn switch sides between tyrion and cersei bronn would effectively be a fourth kettleblack not counting the old one â cersei could also send him to uhh seduceincriminate margaerys loyaltyvirginityfidelity i dont see bronn actively confessing his sins of bedding margaery to the faith  because hes bronn and not an idiot  but i guess the show can spin this to the point where somebody just bargess into the room when hes making a move or something â now the reason why the high septon needs to be killed is not necessarily the same as in the books cersei doesnt get loans apparently in the show the crown has a big debt to both the ib and the faith cerseis reasoning if i kill the high septon theyll bugger off on their loans for some time then the high sparrow comes cersei will say something brash like i dont owe you anything we gave you a diamond crown and you sold it to which the high sparrow will daftly reply with screw you im calling mah banners then bronn comes in and says like oh did you know that she had sex with me ordered me to kill your predecessor and try to screw with margaery yeah she did and boom shes captured by the faith and why would bronn suddenly be there on littlefingers orders though littlefinger does say that he did not expect for cersei to go to the shifter that fast so the bronnlittlefingertheory is pretty much out of the window for book bronn but not necessarily for showbronn â briennes arc is proceeding as i expectedhunt and tarly arent established maidenpool isnt established duskendale isnt establisheda ton of work for a trip that seemed pointless even in the bookâ i like the little hand tip with hot pie and reminding us of the bwb that wayâ she could find the helm i supposeâ but its not really that established a thingâ he wears it less we dont see it hanging on the saddle prominently etcâ its just not as much of a talismanâ might be an interested background tidbit for readersshe sees it but doesnt even stop â hot pie really was able to condense that storyline effectively at first i was almost standing up from my seat with regards if hell spill the beans or not just another great scene in a great episode that ill love to rewatch over and over â as for that storyline brienne and pod are now heading for the eyrie  eliminating the most annoying plot in the books  just like arya and sandor i really think that sandor can get pushed into a river or something like that during perhaps a clash between brienne and him while arya is somewhere else practicing for example changes the story pretty much but hey it leaves that lovely ambiguity â i thats the case then theyll likely kill off his brother as well the books hint towards a confrontation between the two for cerseis trial id say well see the last of sandor for a couple seasons if the actor is on board to come back i dont see what would keep dd from reintroducing a fan favorite â that means a one year absence for rory mccann season 5 is the remainder feastdance season 6 would include cerseis trial lysa had a two year absence there might not even be an absence if they rush through the klplot â im still not sold on the hound fighting ungregor in the trial though it still feels like there should be a warriors son fighting for the faith and killing off a lannister regardless of the outcome is just something a certain sandsnake would propose once she has infiltrated baelors sept thats right ser lancel lannister vs ser bobby strong â tyenes reasoning  ser bobby wins yay a lannister is dead nym will take care off cersei  ser lancel wins yay cersei is deadmeat and nym will have her way with the small counsel men could be horribly wrong though but why else send tyene to kl if shes not going to have influence on something where the faith is directly involved in being a player for the dorne endgame â â i get the argument going back and forth here on one hand  some of you are saying the show has been given liberty to do what they choose with interpreting the story  but on the other hand the point others are trying to make is that if they show arya giving the hound the mercy killing instead of just walking away like in the books then we know for a fact hes not coming back later in the bookstory unless theres another unclegane besides gregor and that would just be  weird â however â another example to illustrate this arguments point â in the show  they chose to make jayne westerling an entirely different character in robb starks story arc  even with a different name and plot line in that she follows him to the freys for the wedding where jayne did not do so in the books there was wild speculation that having talisa be pregnant meant that jeane westerling in the books must also be pregnant because its created a whole new plot for the starks wrong they still killed her but  george hasnt killed jeane westerling in the books  not that we know of  and so by killing talisa they seem to have closed that plot line and possible theory of a future for jeane westerling in the books george cant very well write jeane westerling as alive and kicking with a baby in her belly if the show writers killed off her counterpart  can they â well correlate that to sandor cleganeâ ifâ theres any even remote chance that he didnt actually die in the book  and we have no idea where the last book left off  then they cant possibly have arya give him a mercy killing on the show  it would cause an instant disparity between the show and the book that cant be resolved down the road right â while yes  the showâ doesâ take different storyline paths ie jon snows trip to crasters to kill the mutineers  theyâ doâ seem to always circle back around to the same ending anyways they dont veer so far off the story in the books that its unrecoverable next seasonâ â so my point will go to the team that thinks theyll keep it ambiguous like it was in the book and have arya walk away from the hound without giving him the mercy â of course george can hes going to do whatever he wants with his books the show killed off xxd while george still used him in dance is the show in trouble for this for theyre approaching that storyline not really theyll work around it the show can kill off sandor even if george uses him in winds â the showrunners are taking steps to make sure that the show runs smoothly and thus they can cut storylines grrm can still give jeane her baby it wouldnt likely add much to the current storyline and would likely just give the starks another heir for the future  which may not be important to dd for them to tell the current story â as for circling storylines theyve added another new one hizdahr going to negotiate with yunkai along with daario and the 2ndsons obviously this is just to stretch out the plot for danys meereen arc as peace wont be achieved here obviously while it does give the oppurtunity for the showrunners to imply that hizdahr is working with yunkai thats the circle they can show whereas the books this is left out but heavily implied as for daario hes being morphed into brown ben apparently also going over to yunkai making the i took the meereenese navy for you a circle jerk as well dany had ships and couldve gone to westeros but she didnt she got betrayed and now shes stuck in a siege without a navy thats a great way to end this season for her"

"Newstar",2014-05-21,"â i am hoping for that too that would be nice â i guess the problem is that tv sandor was far more gentlemanly towards sansa than book sandor so he has relatively little to confess apart from failing to intervene when ser meryn was beating her nor can i see tv sandor even if the show is about to kill him off for real telling arya that he should have raped sansa and ripped her heart out rather than leave her for tyrion assuming he learns at some point that sansa married tyrion even if its only done to goad arya into killing him i guess tv sandor could always make some shit up about sansa since thanks to the tv show and the lack of potentially unreliable pov filters we would know that he was lying â question is tv sandor going to find out about sansa marrying tyrion the bit with the kings dead and explaining about joffrey being poisoned seemed like the perfect place to include it i guess sandor could learn that information at the bloody gate seems like a weird omission edited by newstar 21 may 2014  0850 am"

"Lady Fevre Dream",2014-05-22,"agreed he cares about her on a deeper level but i think some want the hound to be written out of the books and show because they want sansa to forget about him i cant see the author going to all that trouble with the romantic stuff building up to a kiss and not resolving that somehow at least with a kiss it would be like the other shoe never dropping and the show has hinted this the author even said so and i think will follow the books â i have to say i havent a clue biased or otherwise about any romantic future for sansa and sandor but i think there are so many story angles for him sansa included â he can still have story that interacts with sansa regardless of the outcome on that point â â some of the ideas i threw out here on this thread are probably the result of too many rereads but all of those rereads have helped me delve deeper into the story and even without any bias i see so many places where sandor could reemerge on the scene and fit in perfectly â â i have many favorites in characters families and factionsi dont speculate based on my biases or try not to do so until it comes to roose bolton â i want him to live not winjust live the bonus would be with fat walda and the coming baby â i do understand though some will base speculation on narrow biases â if i ever feel like im doing that id say so â perhaps my bias is that i enjoy a character and want to see them again but my spec here is more about how the themes of the previously discussed characters fit together not to mention they are in each others ummmmarea â â geographically right now â â â edited by lady fevre dream 22 may 2014  0545 pm"

"Lady Fevre Dream",2014-05-22,"im the opposite the more i think about it the more certain i become that sandor has been written out of the narrativeâ true martin does leave numerous deaths ambiguous only to later reveal the character still aliveâ davos comes to mind as does theonâ however there is not a lot of ambiguity when it comes to sandorâ he asked arya to kill him because his wound was unhealableâ later we have an eye witness to his death say he tried to help the man but he died anywaysâ he then proceeded to bury himâ at this point letting sandor live is the equivalent of lying to ones readers to shock them later an amateur writing trick that martin tries to avoidâ â then there is the entire theme of feast of crowsâ this book is almost a morality tale about the horrors of war regardless of the nobility of its causeâ sandor embraced a philosophy he learned cruelly from his brother that strength and violence are the only truthsâ he made himself the strongest and one of the most feared killers in westerosâ yet on the blackwater he became a broken man â like an alcohol addict there really is no way to go back to the happy times when the vice didnt destroy ones ability to function in societyâ martin with his emphasis on unavoidable consequences might just have written sandor one of the few happy endings possible for somebody whose killed his share of innocents including a good portion of the stark householdâ â hard to say i think with the sandor and sansa relationship framed as nonromantic in the show because otherwise that would be creepy knowing sansas fate doesnt warrant a mention in the limited time the show has for example there was never a scene where sansa is told what happened to bran and rickon she mourns robb and catelyns death but not her other brothers on the otherhand knowing sansas fate would definitely be a huge moment for arya as it leads her to believe she is the last stark so i think they will include it for that character if not the other â being as i said id try and address this post when i had more time here goes â ive done my big typing for the day i think but here goes â i cant disagree with some of your points about affc but as far as sandor goes i do â he may have broke on the blackwater but i think he saw getting arya to her mother and brother as a chance at a new life for himself if possible â that trip was as much for him as it was for arya â the blackwater and his fear of fire broke his dishonorable ties to the lannsiters i think he was looking for honor with robb stark â i dont see him as an alcoholic who cant go back thanks to his brothers deathi see him as a man learning to move past it whatever happens in the future with ungregor â if he should be the one to rid the world of frankengreg itll be because it has to be done itll be symmetry â it may also be his way to repay the faith for taking him in and nursing him back to health inside and out â â i think sandor saw his chance at being a good man to be tied to that chance to swear his sword to robb â it was sansa and arya and his time with each of them that made it seem possible â brienne being the one to come to the quiet isle looking for answers about them and sandor being there and the knighthood issues they have in common could be as important as the stark sisters themselves to sandors story â im not saying hell live happily ever after with or without sansa or anyone else for that matter im saying i see lots of places he can fit into the storyline and i dont think grrm is done with him â not for nothing does it seem that theres lots going on in sandors latitude now and if danys visions meant anythingthe final battle may wind up in the riverlands too â there are many places and points for sandor to still play a part a big part in the story â as far as sandor and sansa and the showand whether or not its important that he find out about sansas marriage i dont think it matters how much of a romantic or sexual slant their characters had or didnt have together on the show what matters in those circumstances are the deep feelings between the two â the show doesnt have to do it exactly the same as in the book but its still important even to show sandor to know and react to what he thinks was sansas fate with tyrion and flight from him and kl â edited by lady fevre dream 22 may 2014  0607 pm"

even for his wife â i dont place any weight on grrms wifes attachment to arya in terms of enhancing her survival prospects grrms very proud of writing a series where anyone can die and no one not even arya is safe â â however i think there has been heavy foreshadowing since the beginning agree that in agot it is extremely significant at arya and sansa meeting again theyve each forgiven the other in their own way i wouldnt be surprised to see them together in some capacity before the end â grrm has said arya and sansa have issues that they need to work outwhich doesnt mean of course that they will wind up doing so i do think that an aryasansa reunion might fare better than some of the other horrible reunions i listed upthread simply because they were never that wild about each other anyway compared to the way jon and arya desperately miss each other â jon and arya on the other hand have one of the sweetest warmest most loving most touching relationships in asoiafso you can only imagine how fucked up shit is going to get when they reunite â â wrt jon i also think you are on to something with the fact that their reunion might not be all its cracked up to be but my money is on jon dying not arya mostly because arya is my favourite not a strong argument i know â could be if jon is not intended to do anything else after he helps save westeros or whatever i could see him dying his very dramatic death at the end of adwd makes me think grrm wont pull the same trick twice though â â i do not see arya meeting back up with the hound if he indeed features again their time together

winterfell in fact rickon dying would be terrible news for the manderlys davos stannis and all the north seems just like what a certain sadistic writer we know would do â i dont think sansa is going to wind up as anything of winterfell lady regent castellan scullery maid anything that ship sailed the moment her wolf died andor the moment ned stark died as far as im concerned grrm has refused to absolve sansa of bearing partial responsibility for neds demise which means no winterfell or any stark goodies for her it wouldnt do to have an endgame lordlady of winterfell who had had a hand in ned starks death whatever shenanigans rickon gets up to on cannibal island he is innocent of any part in the death of ned stark and is therefore not permanently tainted as sansa is furthermore grrm has also refused to absolve sansa of bearing responsibility for ladys death and he has hinted at possibility of sansa no longer being a stark by virtue of losing her wolf there must be a stark in winterfell and if sansa is no longer truly a stark because of ladys death a death for which grrm believes she bears responsibility well â as for rickon i think the only possible point of his existence is to be the spare male to carry on the stark line that pretty much every line in his tearful farewell to bran in 3x09 of the showinsisting he needs to protect his older brother bran anxious to protect his family even those who are supposedly supposed to protect him check stressing that he wasnt a southerner proudly claims his northern identity and rejects any possibility of being a southerner check and telling osha he knows how to use a sword warrior badass in the making checkscreamed future lord of winterfell in the house sealed the deal in my mind not to mention bran being all you have to survive you are the heir to winterfell in case anything happens to me add on that the fact that grrm let liam cunningham davos in on a pretty cool secret about twow that cunningham seemed pretty pumped abouta secret i doubt is davos mission to rescue rickon is fruitless andor davos dies in the attemptand i think book rickon is going to come roaring back in a big way one of grrms favourite themes is the forgotten underdog who was never in the hunt barreling out of nowhere to take it all thats how tpatq turned out and grrm has supposedly said that thats how the fight for the iron throne will end with someone unexpected on it meaning in all likelihood jon or one of the baratheon bastards legitimizedalthough even if he never said it tpatq suggests that thats what hes going to do sansas been treated as the heir to winterfell by various parties who have no idea rickons still alive and has believed herself to be the heir to winterfell for a while now meaning shell never

expect him to go out with a bang and it would be nice if he and sansa did kiss and bang before that before anyone asks yes in a few years time when sansa is all grown up and knows what she wants and she would be the one to initiate it hed probably be really surprised and confused as to whats going on what she really wants me someone predicted that in his second life as sandor clegane he will get to experience what the elder brother said he never did price in service joy in victory loving and being loved and this second life should not be focused on hatred ofkilling gregor i hope that this

feed your dog bones under the table you do not seat him beside you on the high bench â the similarity appeals to me â whether sandor survives the end of the saga which would surprise me or not they arent going to get married  a lowborn marriage like that would screw up things for sansa politically i hope for some progress in westeros but that much would be a bit unrealistic not so fast anyway i think she will never marry like queen bess  because she is politically savvy but she hates the idea of being in a political loveless marriage and having power on your own is always better than relying on the power of your husband especially since youre always subjected to him in the patriarchal society something arianne is not aware of because she lacks the experience that sansa or cersei or dany or other women outside of dorne have had though she may pretend she could accept various political suitors something bess also did until late in life so i dont think shell seat sandor or anyone beside her on the high bench but she will enjoy feeding him under the table which whatever septa mordane says ladies do just not officially and as openly as the lords do â and if he dies since i suspect sansa to survive any other relationships she may have later in life will i believe also be with someone she likes and who loves her for herself and who she doesnt marry probably also someone relatively lowborn compared to her at least  no political marriage to any of the great houses â this is pretty much how i see sansas personal future what im not sure is regarding children  i think sansa would want to have them and actually i can see her having at least one bastard child its thematically relevant with her playing alayne stone modelling her on jon being fascinated by ellaria sand and mya stone  but how would she deal with it regarding her reputation and politicalsocial standing would there be false official parentage involved once again in the series or could the customs of westeros change so much again im not sure if the latter would be realistic"

"hollowcrown",2014-05-19,"my friends hilarious predictions â â anyways this is as far as my predictions go now anything can happen though having aryahound and briannepod arrive at the vale at the same time would be hilarious or what if they meet halfway there and brianne  the hound battle yes i can see it now its episode 9 there will be a mayor chaotic everybody dies climax that will happen in the end of the episode hide i assume it will be the wildlings attack on the wall the 9th episode is called the watchers on the wall so that is obviously going to be the big battle where everybody dies i bet likesam will die or something or maybe ghost or yrgitte doubt jon will die janos slynt andor alester will surely die and so will tormund and the cannibal dude hmm yeah i can already see it now everybody is fighting at castle black there is chaos but jon manages to lead the defense and everybody alester sees this and sees jon alone giving orders he thinks this is his opportunity to strike him and remove this pain in his ass once and for all he goes to stab jon maybe succeds but then ygrittejonghost come and attack alester and save jon alester dies or could be janos slyntor both however before that arya and the hound walk through the riverlands and notice the eyrie far in the horizon they decide to take a break for the night before going to sleep the hound opens up to arya he confesses why he kills maybe confesses something else hes hidden or some emotions he repressed maybe he had some hidden emotions when he killed mycah like maybe fear of reprisal by joffrey or his brother or some stuff and tells her about it after that he tells her he is sorry about murdering the boy and goes to sleep then arya lies down and starts mentioning the names of her list joffrey is gone cersei is still in it etc etc when she comes down to the hounds name she stares intensively to the camera we hear the dun dun dun inception intense scene sound effect and she justâ closes her eyes falling into a deep sleep arya forgives the hound for what he did and doesnt want him dead any more however when they wake up brianne and pod arrive brianne recognizes the hound and arya or just figures out who she is the hound wakes up and confronts brianne arya is still asleep brianne demands the hound to give arya to her the hound will try to be a smartass and ask for the same reward hed get at the vale brianne on her honor and stuff says he ought to give her back and then face the consequences of kidnapping a poor suffering child brianne starts namecalling the hound calling him fugly and stuff very hurtful indeed we see the hound distressed he has an injury cant fight very well and he knows he will lose the fight well he can still call brianne names and stuff beforeâ brianne challenges the hound to a fight and the two clash swords these wake arya up she sees the hound fighting with an unknown woman who has an unknown squire she sees brianne is winning she yells at them tells them to stop or just watches helplessly as the hound gets his ass wooped maybe brianne can at some point stop and call her name out and tell her she will take her to safety oh but arya doesnt trust that everybody that took her to safety lied like the brotherhood without banners and the hound after that the hound is the only one she can trust now arya yells at brianne to stop or something brianne doesnt hear her assumes shes afraid and keeps beating the hound the hound gasps for air hes tired he cant use his left arm at all because his shoulder wound rotted and festered hes clutching rises to his feet brianne is a few meters in front of him he looks to his side sees arya eye to eye then he stumbles to attack brianne and brianne puts a sword through his chest the hound drops to the floor and dies arya is in shock and stands still or not whatever brianne comes closer to her and tells her everything will be alright that she will take her to her sister or to jon or to the vale or whatever arya though believes brianne to be a lannister sellsword that killed the hound for the reward brianne calls arya by name so arya realizes this lannister sellsword knows who she is so she will take her back to kings landingâ right before brianne grabs her arya slips through her fingers and runs away into the woods in episode 10 we see arya trying to survive in the woods we see her alone in dark places whatever she makes a fire and goes to sleep she recites her list when she arrives to the end of the list she calls out briannes name and goes to sleep end i doubt well see where arya goes next doubt it will be the eyrie at least not until season 5 maybe dragonstone would be funny having arya meeting davos or something and meeting melisandre again dunno what else maybe she sneaks to the twins and plans on murdering walter frey in season 5 maybe she tries to go to a port to sneak to braavos this i dunno but i doubt it will be shown in this seasons finale anyways im calling this now too much foreshadowing in this episode with hot pie the fork in the road with brianne the hound opening up to arya arya helping him but the hound refusing to heal his wound because of his fear of fire its too much coincidencesomething big will happen i hope pod survives all of this though the only thing that is a big  is kings landing i have absolutely no idea what can happen there maybe tyrion escapes kings landing and goes somewhere else maybe everybody dies dunno these next few episodes will be very intriguing back at kings landing anything will surprise me â â"

"Tyrion1991",2014-05-18,"skahaz would be far more interesting if he truly is loyal and devoted to daenerys that is what makes him so awesome and how many characters should they cut  they cut plumm and the stormcrows and belwas her dothraki xaro if they thought the story would have had too many characters they shouldnt have started filming â next thing you come up with merging faegon and quentyn because they are actually quite the same both wanna marry dany and both related to the martellsâ â seriously if you dont like the essos part fine but dont say they should and could cut most of it â â anyway recap anyone â these are precisely the sort of characters that need to be cut if they want to tell the story obviously aegon and quentyn will be included but they are much more important than shakaz and the green grace by several orders of magnitude in factâ â theyd have to put a battle early in season 6 anyway the only question is winterfell or meereen like you say season 5 is complex and it will be complex enough without rushing through danys story rushing through dany means rushing through tyrion who has a lot of ground to cover from pentos to introducing the griffs to the aegon reveal at the sorrows to getting captured by jorah to becoming a slave and only then reaching meereen tyrion material would suffocate season 5 and suck away screentime from all the other important storylines if the battle is to happen in episode 9 and this makes the season even more complex there is no good way to adapt this upcoming season in comparison with the books at least you just have to decide which plotlines and characters you want to butcher and run with it in my opinion letting dany fall into the background of season 5 and delaying the big battle to an early season 6 episode will do wonders for the rest of the story and its not that there wouldnt be a big battle that season therell be winterfell or a good and anticipation inducing climax for dany the pit is an awesome scene not saying that this will happen though it seems like were getting dorne but the iron iskands might get entirely cut in favor of fitting both meereen and winterfell into season 5s episode 9 â meereen is the big budget battle you have dragons ships potentially dothraki and the cgi city all with multiple pov characters present winterfell is a bunch of guys in a snowstorm at the end of the day and can be very small scale also it would be repetitive to have 2 big end of season battles with stannis n co â they are not going to do what grrm did the big budget battle will not happen in early season 6 the show has followed a consistent pattern of building up to a climax in episode 9 its not reasonable to assume that they will suddenly change that cant understand the desire for the show to repeat the same mistake grrm did this is precisely why the show has spent much of season 4 on adwd material for danyâ â tyrions story will be compacted as well i think a lot of people are refusing to accept the limitations of the tv show to telling this story as it is written in the books a lot of people did say that the series was unfilmable before hbo took on the project and dd have went so far as to say that season 5 has given them nightmares cuts are to be expected"
"Tixu Oty",2014-05-18,"what i know is that danys arc is stretched enough as it is we get a couple of minutes every episode those sort of numbers do not add up to a happy ending if they add 2 additional characters to danys arc lets look at who needs to be added next season â victarion euron doran arriane sandsnakes quentyn aegon griff val â there is simply no place for additional ghiscari characters â we all know there are way too many characters in affcadwd for them to be all cast in season 5 but with that argument alone you can come up with any name and say they cantâ be in cause theres too many people already so its all about who will turn out to be essential to the rest of the story and who will make for good storytelling i dont know if the mereenese characters are essential to the rest of the story yet but i do think theyd make for entertaining characters â also it seems to me that the reason why danys arc seems so stretched out is because theyre really stalling i was surprised her mereneese council wasnt cast this season so either youre right and they wont be cast at all or theyre saving it for later hello jojen meera ramsay and the tully family they chose a very limited arc for dany this season and while i think they do need to pick up the pace i dont think theyre intend to rush through the rest of it so much next season that would be a very strange constrast in my opinion â they will do the battle of meereen at the end of season 5 its not even up for discussion 2 seasons of meereen is an incredibly generous concession to grrm but they will not have dany still in meereen at the end of the penultimate season 6 they have only done big battles in episode 9 and they cant do the wall treatment on this battle grrm has already set this to be the biggest and most complex battle in the series to dateâ â i get that it would be nice to not have dany spend too much time in mereen i do and lets face it her whole story since the beginning of season two is leading up to the battle of mereen they stalled a lot of it for locigal reasons but its still the biggest momentum of her story it needs appropriate attention as boring as mereen seemed on first read i now realize its very dense and probably important material besides its not right to sacrifice the story just because we all want dany to get the hell out of there already so yes i get your point but i think its not good enough a reason â the sons of the harpy do not need a face or characters show dany responding to the threat by marrying hidzhar and have barristans suspicion also the sons have yet to do anything important they have killed a handful of unsullied and brazen beasts kind of pales in comparison to the hundred thousand strong slaver army and fleet outside the cityâ â see above post if they delay the battle of meereen into season 6 they have to do it at episode 9 and that leaves dany still in meereen at the end of the penultimate season they will not do that dd know her wow material and what she does when she gets back to westeros i am extremely doubtful that the material of two books with dany could be compressed into one tv season â â suspicions about who thats the point just about hizdahr you could be right but i think itd be kind of boring in this case the only characters that would matter in danys story would be barristan and hizdahr im leaving daario aside because hes pretty much just there as danys fuckbuddy at this point nice but brings nothing to the plot and the importance of the sons of the harpy is not how much damage they can cause but how they impact danys decisions youd expect her to give up yet she doesnt even though the situation is getting worse and worse everyday she marries hizdarh because of them i dont think thats as unimportant as you make it out to be and i think the conjunction of internal soh and external problems siege make for a great story im sure itll play out better on tv than it did in the books â theyd have to put a battle early in season 6 anyway the only question is winterfell or meereen like you say season 5 is complex and it will be complex enough without rushing through danys story rushing through dany means rushing through tyrion who has a lot of ground to cover from pentos to introducing the griffs to the aegon reveal at the sorrows to getting captured by jorah to becoming a slave and only then reaching meereen tyrion material would suffocate season 5 and suck away screentime from all the other important storylines if the battle is to happen in episode 9 and this makes the season even more complex i agree as much as i would like the battle of mereen at the end of season 5 i think it might work out better at the beginning of season 6 especially since all the preview chapters that i havent read but have read about make this battle seem complex and yes theres the problem of bringing tyrion and victarion up to speed it definitely can be done but then im not sure if there would be sufficient space left for the other stories it does seem like the battle of winterfell might be easier to bring to completion in a short time right now i could see danys arc in season 5 ending like this pit dany flies away barristan is left to figure out the poisoning stuff dany hangs out with drogon then meets the dothraki well now im really eager to see who gets cast or not we can get a better idea about all this

"Alayne Stone",2014-05-19,"well we read the books dd read the books and talk with the authors so i think they understand every character they also understand they cant have successful tv show by trying to make carbon copies of the book characters for instance they didnt write shae the way they did because they didnt understand her grrm could have shared all his opinions backstories notes and everything that doesnt make it to the final material they felt that recreating her the way they did made for a better show im willing to concede they understand her if that means they just didnt like her very much outcome is the same my opinion is based mostly on three things sansas blistering rebuke of the septa in season 1 oh i forgot i dont care the emmense popularity of tyrion dany jon bronn oberyn arya jamie and any other character whose plots tend to get more threads and comments than a sansa one and the missing seven minutes at the end of last nights episode"

"juanml82",2014-05-21,"and in terms of the sansa of it two major things about lfs gift in the last alayne chapter are 1 the fact that his plan to supposedly give her winterfell depends on the death of an annoying but helpless and sick child who relies on sansa and 2 the fact that it involves a political marriage to a handsome young knightheir something that sansa would have been delighted with when we first met her and that littlefinger seems to think would still delight her without even realizing that said prince or knight is a douche while the present sansa is both unlikely to be taken by handsome douchey young knights and sick and tired of being auctioned off for her claim to various political marriages which is a major theme in asos from her forced marriage to tyrion to her disillusionment with the tyrells to her feelings about her aunt telling her she has to marry sr and leads to her attitude to marriage in affc one has to be really really disinterested in sansa as a character and in her story and development to think that this kind of change would be a good idea in any way 1 its true that the hth plan puts sansa in a moral bind for harry to lead the armies of vale its convenient that sr is dead the quick and simple answer is that the show can replace that moral issue with something else after all sansa is pretty much making a deal with the devil i see two issues here do you see sansa agreeing or accepting the death of sr because if she doesnt its a moot point and if it thats what makes her turn against lf thats also easily replaced with something else the issue i think is what happens if twow booksansa will be turning a blind eye to srs death if that was to happen which i doubt youll believe then id agree the show will have a hard time adapting that without hth unfortunately i also think that the show would chicken out of such a development anyway just like showtyrion doesnt kill a singer or showrobb invades the westerlands but doesnt order his troops to sack the region â 2 nothing of that is present in the show and hth as douche isnt in the books either instead of wondering if she could make loras love her by giving him sons she wonders if her family would be at the wedding so its likely that it wont be introduced in the show either independently of whether hth is cast or not and if shes supposed to act reticent to the marriage in twow and thats important enough for the plot that the show has to include it they can make her oppose the marriage for any other set of reasons"

was once very much like sansa in fact so blame him for writing it grrm does not care one whit about his readers potentially delicate sensibilities if he did he wouldnt have treated us to this littlefingersansa grossness to begin with and yet littlefingersansa grossness is part of her arc and has been since way back in agot when littlefinger undressed an 11yearold sansa with his eyes and stroked her hair and now grrm has contrived it so that a pedophile intent on grooming sansa is the most significant figure currently in her life so here we are â this series is often full of nasty stomachchurning offputting material and grrm goes out of his way to shock and offend moreover as asoiaf readers grow increasingly jaded and are gradually desensitized to asoiaf gore and rape grrm seems to keep trying to come up with new and exciting ways to top himself in the horror department with each book being progressively more disturbing and disgusting in adwd we were treated to a dying quentyns eyeballs liquefying tyrion raping a deadeyed slave jeyne tortured and alluding to bestiality and other such delights agot seems positively tame in comparison grrm seems to be stepping this up in twow as well and the starks are by no means exempt as arya has graduated from being merely propositioned by pedophiles to being molested by them and to weaponizing her sexuality despite being all of 11 years old as i said grrm doesnt care if his readers are disturbed the books are calculated to disturb whatever else we may say about grrm he gives good horror â i think this tendency of grrms to go for the gritty and extremeheightened in later books that affc sequence where some ironborn is raping humfrey hewetts daughter in front of him after the daughter whose age is not specified was forced to serve ironborn thugs naked was way more disturbing than anything in the first three booksis something we should all bear in mind when speculating about sansa if grrm is more likely to go for something calculated to make his readers recoil given the choice and if the books are getting progressively nastier in terms of contentmore gore more creatively horrifying injuries more abuse more rape more mutilation more disfigurement more cannibalism more physical or sexual torture more psychological torture the walk of shame reek etc etcwhich the mercy twow chapter would certainly seem to support then i very much doubt that sansa will be exempt from that â so if some bit of speculation about sansa makes a reader fetch his or her smelling salts well given the way the books are going that suggests its that much more likely to happen and therefore worthy of discussion no matter how uncomfortable it might make some littlefinger or some other character attempting to rape sansa would be pretty small potatoes in the shock department rape attempts are old hat for sansa even littlefinger forcibly raping sansa would be relatively tame especially by the standard grrm set in adwd in terms of ramping up the disturbing material littlefinger successfully seducing sansa or sansa seducing littlefinger on the other handnow that would fuck readers up much like arya being molested and using the promise of sex to lure her victim did when the mercy chapter was released â the other thing to bear in mind is that arya and sansas training arcs are very closely linked in that they seem to be learning much the same skills even if sansas training is ostensibly political and aryas training is assassin training the fm drill arya in the art of observing others and picking up important bits of information and littlefinger does the same when quizzing sansa about lyn corbray although his training is a lot more halfassed than the fms methodical instruction arya learns the lying game to discern and tell lies sansa is forced to up her own lying game arya learns how to adopt different personas and even starts thinking about the different personalities of those identities mercy smiles and eats fruit and is easy to get along with eg while sansa refines and gives serious thought to her alayne persona almost as if alayne is a real person alayne is bastard brave unlike the frightened sansa sansas not sure if alayne likes dancing as sansa did etc and so on â so with all that about the similarities between arya and sansas skill sets and parallels in their trainingnow that arya has started using her sexuality as a weapon albeit outside her training what does that say about the chances that sansa will do the same thing and if grrm is subjecting prepubescent arya to that kind of treatment what would the equivalent of that kind of treatment be for a 13yearold sansa â â so the only thing she might enjoy is rape or attempt of rape how very progressive empowering and feminist of her would that be â because dany coming to enjoy her rapes and eventually falling in love with her rapist was so progressive empowering and feminist oh wait it wasnt and yet grrm wrote it that way and apparently seems to have viewed it that way â the fans convictions that grrm would never write x thing because they dont consider it sufficiently progressiveempoweringfeminist for the character are irrelevant since theyre not the ones writing this thing and their opinions as to whats sufficiently feminist to go in the books are therefore irrelevant what matters is what grrm considers progressiveempoweringfeminist and he hasinteresting ideas about such things if his treatment of female characters in asoiaf is any indication a treatment many feminist posters on these and other boards can and have found problematic at best and offensive or sexist at worst â also after grrm 1 portrayed one of the few female rulers as a spiteful insanely jealous murderous shrew and a figure worthy of scorn and ridicule 2 dedicated the better part of an entire book to showing how ridiculously incompetent one of the most powerful women in his series was and 3 proceeded to showcase the other most powerful woman in the series mooning over a boy instead of attending to governance and making mistake after mistake after mistake in the next volume i find the idea that grrm writes with no other object than feminist ideals in mind touchingly naive â â then we have this sansa using sex as weapon people have you actually read her chapters like really read we are speaking about girl whose every encounter with sexuality has been more than tragic and suddenly she will transform into seductress a la cersei using her body as leverage â well since youve read the books you must remember danys chapter where she goes from terrified sexually abused traumatized 13yearold child whose every encounter with sexuality had been more than tragic on the verge of suicide to someone who coolly and calmly makes a calculated decision to learn sexual techniques and to seduce drogo for her own purposes within the very same chapter if you accept as accurate the speculation that sansas entire asoiaf arc is essentially a longform version of danys in that bit of agot where she goes from meek traumatized scared shitless abuse victim to badass sexually confident seductress khaleesi within the space of a single chapter then yes she will suddenly transform into a seductress a la dany just as dany did in agot â â and then people speak about this being empowerment and feminism â eh its a mixed bag in the books in terms of the depiction of players using their sexuality arianne using arys is painted as sketchy cersei seducing osney as rewards for favours is presented as another one of cerseis spectacularly illadvised decisions littlefinger prostituting himself to lysa is treated as both sinister and as humorous sansa listening to lysas howls of ecstasy bronn selling himself to the stokeworths is treated as a jolly affair alys is none too thrilled about being shuffled into a marriage to sigorn and bitches about wildlings in her bedchamber but nonetheless drags him out to the dance floor in the end etc sometimes however characters using their sexuality as a tool is occasionally sold as an empowering act by grrmdany seducing drogo her rapist and captor supposedly marking her transformation into a powerful woman alys making the best of jon prostituting her with her confident let sigorn be afraid of me arya trading on her sexuality to murder raff assuming were supposed to see that as awesome and badasswhich is worthy of note when were speculatingabout what grrm might have in mind for sansa edited by newstar 24 may 2014  1200 am"
"Raksha 2014",2014-05-24,"â â â bronn selling himself to the stokeworths may be treated as a jolly affair for bronn in the books â i always wondered how poor lollys after surviving gangrape and the pregnancy that resulted would feel about the marriage bed and just hoped as much as one can hope when thinking of a fictional character that bronn was kind to her and didnt rush her into doing her marital duty â â i dont necessarily view danys seducing drogo her rapist and captor as the mark of her transformation into a powerful woman â she was married to him by the will of her only family who was also her older brother and liegelord and did not have a way out of the marriage â i think of danys seduction of drogo as a sign of her determination to make a frightening and rather miserable situation more bearable â it was danys determination and not necessarily her use of it to seduce her husband that eventually made her become more powerful â she sought to improve her life within the bounds of her marriage regardless of the unfairness and learn as much as she could about her husband his life and his culture not just make their sexual encounters easier â â but sansa is not in the same position â littlefinger is not her husband there is no socialculturalfamilial pretext for her to submit to his advances when she clearly at least in the book does not appreciate them or at least not to submit fully and sexually â theres a huge difference in manipulating a nervous child prone to dangerous fits into compliance by allowing him to kiss her on the cheek and allowing littlefinger or any man sansa does not want to take sexual liberties with her â and it is to be hoped that if sansa ever marries she will come to the marriage bed of her own free will with a kind and understanding husband â just because terrible things happen to many female characters in asoiaf does mean we should have to see all the female characters degraded â â i dont think all women have to advance themselves only by having sex with people they would otherwise not want â it really would depend on the situation â i dont see why we have to expect sansa to have an eitheror situation of either continuing to be a passive innocent manipulated by players or sansa seducing her way to power by having sex with littlefinger and other men or women she does not want â there are ways between the extremes â sansa is a beautiful and intelligent and extremely observant girl â flirting could take her a long way as can learning how the lords and ladies of the vale interact and what secrets they keep which she is already doing â â its grrms party he can certainly write what he wants to write â but sansa is one of my favorite characters and i still hope that she will not have to resort to having unwanted sex to fulfill her potential â edited by raksha 2014 24 may 2014  1203 am"

"Ser Oromus Locke",2014-05-19,"yeah theyve pretty much destroyed jons entire arc these past two seasons so at this point im really not all that surprised this whole season on the wall has just been filler anyways which makes the fact that the took so many short cuts during jons time beyond the wall all the more frustrating if they had just taken the time to do it right to begin with jon could easily still be with the wildings just about to make the climb and the next season could start with the wildling attack happening as it did in the books now its all become rather confused and it is difficult to really take the wildling threat seriously as their size and strength is mostly just implied at this point â what are you talking about why should the next season start with the wildling attack as it did in the books the wildlings came at the end of book3 not the beginning of book5 â and about it being confused i think its pretty darn clear jon is constantly referring to the threat from the beyond the wall even going as far as going after the mutineers to keep their secrets and weve been reminded of the wildlings south of the wall as well literally everything jon snow this season has been saying to viewers theres a clash coming from both the north and south of the wall what this season isnt telling us is that stannis is going to arrive just in time though this episode kinda did tell us that mel selyse and shireen are also moving away from dragonstone anybody with a bit of memory would remember where to â implied strength pretty sure theyve been saying 100000 men  giants this entire time thats not implied thats explicitly stated not to mention that jon has stated to ygritte that the wildlings are largely untrained in my personal opinion the remarks we get on the wildling host are extremely close to the ones we get in the book they have large numbers in the show explicitely stated dunno if that was true in the books but the majority of their host is filled with women and children that have also left their homes â i dont think jons storyline has been destroyed far from it yes theyve added that crasters keepplot and effed up with sam but if you really want to want to take a gander at a top three of destroyed storyline then that pretty much was all sam sam and sam â â yarwyck is the character everyone has assumed is bowen marsh â this left me confused as well â the below is from trailers so you may not want to know whats apparently happening spoiler arent there clips in trailers of tormund fighting alliser and of grenn in the tunnel plus grenns support of jons suggestion could be ironic foreshadowing of the prediction by many that grenn will be the one to die stopping the giant â noooooo not him this season is going to leave the cast in shambles  â i mean they already killed off rorge and biter  â to be fair sealing the gate would have just meant mance would have marched elsewhere forcing mance to march on the shadow tower or eastwatch would have spread the watch thinner better to have them attack a known defensible position then 2 or more less defensible ones on the opposite sides of a continent â frankly the situation shouldnt be nearly as dire on the show given that marsh never marched off to the bridge of skulls with most of the remaining garrison â this is mances strategy in the books maybe they already have sent bowen to the shadow tower to deal with this strategy"

"Ser Oromus Locke",2014-05-19,"so are we not getting a shavepate â almost positive that daario will turn his cloak â when i heard that she ordered him to go to yunkai the first thing i thought was oh so daario has now morphed into not so brown ben plumm its exactly what they needed to do in my eyes oh and grey worm will take daarios commanding roles i mean they even clearly established the sellsword motto in this episode so it should be clear that he switches sides daario likes the two fs but like my man russell brand has spoken the one f gets dull after a prolonged relationship and as he says he cant get the other f in meereen â this thing with hizdahr going to yunkai is a bit weird but it allows for the meereen storyline to be stretched a bit until the last episode will reveal that danys plan has failed and that shes now cornered and besieged with zero allies especially if shes dismissed jorah and it will effectively push danys story arc in season 5 into a higher gear because of the constant threat whereas dany is now boring shell be far more hardpressed and entertaining in season 5 also because she cant swoon over daario if hes become brown ben having her needing to focus on ruling entirely â pretty sure theyre casting shavepate right now â ruling a city and what does she have a once legendary knight a girl that speaks 19 languages and an army of unsullied that have started to fall due to nightly gorilla attacks theyll need a few more to fill the meereenese camp â â im okay with the throwaway introduction of the trouble at astapor mostly because were not going to spend much more time there its more of a distant problem for dany that only comes to bite her once the pale mare arrives the revenge killings on the other hand see my point above i dont know what they were thinking introducing something that close to danys current storyline like that â â as for hizdahr being sent to yunkai shes sending him there as an ambassador hoping that he being a master will convince the other masters not to throw their lies away personally i thinks its more than likely that he will betray her encourage yunkai to attack establish connections between yunkai and the harpy and then come running back to daenerys saying the masters threatened to kill him or something cue more killings in the street followed by his marriage proposals to stop the violence â i think theyre actually taking their time to set meereen we need to think that things are moderately okay for her to sit there on her little throne before it all turns to shift in the last episode in which  like you what youre saying  hizdahr will return with some lame excuse that they tried to kill him and that second sons have turned cloak as the then banished jorah foretold its sort of the same as the jonbrancrasterplot to me and in this case it is just stalling time and allowing for daario to be morphed into brown ben  which means that well get tyrion joining daario at the end of season 5 daario is pretty big in dance but hes also often away on missions for which they can use whatever unsullied division leader theyll sort of establish the writers can easily use grey worm for those missions â its just an easy way to spread out her arc this season while already introducing some main characters for season 5 in like two episodes â as for the revenge killings its the same as the goats in the earlier episode if they were rushing this storyline then they immediately wouldve gone to hazzea but they didnt same with the revenge killings it doesnt hurt to slowly introduce an issue that starts as a small issue remember that skahaz reports that the killings increase well they obviously do not start off with killing 9 unsullied at a time something i always thought about the beginning of dance was that it felt like quite a few weeks had passed since she conquered meereen at the end of swords this tailpart of the season feels to me as if theyre filling that gap with a few choices that dont really hurt the following storyline all that much â â yeah its very strange first qarth was taken out of the picture in season two then she got control of the meereenese navy and now shes stopping the yunkaii before they can reclaim astapor and march to meereen it looks like theyre taking out all the things that led up to the second siege of meereen and the eventual battle of fire â its all to make it seem as if danys line of ruling is working until episode 10 in which the reveal will come that the second sons have joined yunkai and that they are advancing on her oops â just think of daario as ben plumm after this episode second sons have the meereenese navy sooooooo when they turn cloak for yunkai who has control of the meereenese navy not danaerys thats for sure theyre temporarily making it seem as if shes ruling well enough but only for the next two episodes or so im pretty sure well see the meereenese knot in full effect in season 5 â really i dont remember what season 2 ended on but 1 and 3 ended with dany having success the meereenstoryline is really all about her being backed into a corner on every front â â in mentioning the templesperhaps we are due to meet the green grace soon â i dont think so probably season 5 along with skagaz and reznak if those guys in the meereen assault scene werent them already i think they focused on three separate meereenese the whole time one of which was hizdahr with the scrawny caucasian guy perhaps being reznak and a big tan burly guy perhaps being skagaz"

"ohpooratlas",2014-05-19,"if i remember correctly when the harpy killings are first introduced in the books its kind of as a throwaway line as well right its only after the murders persist and one of missendeis brothers are murdered that dany issues the order to double the patrols and then later citizens of meereen freed slaves dany sympathizers are murdered and so the plot escalates so we have plenty of time to get into the sons of the harpy plot â i also think the fact that they keep mentioning the graces means we will be introduced to them soonâ â really not sure where they are going with the hizdar in yunkai thing though but i feel like the invented material for meereen has been solid so far so im going to remain optimistic for the time being im sure hizdar will be back dany will need someone to take jorahs place on her council and we will eventually have to put some faces to the eventual opposition she facesâ"
"Joseph Nobles",2014-05-19,"i think hizdahr will escape from yunkai to bring news of the second sons treachery and marrying him is the only way to shore up her control of meereen any ambivalence about the marriage will be crushed when a shepherd shows up with drogons latest victim jorah will freak the eff out and dany will send him packing especially if barristan chooses then to revealâ jorahs spy activities for robert baratheon"

"Caerl Targaryen",2014-05-20,"dang those are some serious oversimplifications sounds about right for their take on essos so far though"
"Tixu Oty",2014-05-20,"i really like what theyre doing with the meereen situation so far i like that dany is settling down and getting into the political side of it all for some reason it seems much more appealing to me on screen than it did in the books hizdahr isnt send to rule but to negociate which i thought was a great move since its setting him up to be an adviser of some sort later on i dont think hizdahr and daario will be gone very long i have no idea where theyre going with this but i do like that they are starting to change some details around on the meereenese plot that stuff needed simplification and dramatization to work well on screen ive read some of you think daario will stay in yunkai thats good thinking guys but it feels like its kinda early for daario to betray dany dont you think also the revenge killings are the slaves taking revenge on the masters as is depicted in the books supplicants and stuff i like that they also keep gently reminding us that things arent all that easy inside meereen either â â just a quick question is there discussion of twow chapters here if so i will excuse myself from the discussion as i am waiting for the book to release to read it in its entirety i dont think theres been anything about it so far and anyways i have a question for you guys are we supposed to use spoiler tags when discussing wow preview chapters i guess it would make sense â a little bit of him being whitebeard and showing his humblenessâ a little bit of ass kicking here and thereâ having him hover over her like the body guard he isâ those things would all be niceâ i mean isnt he more important than daario ultimatelyâ and speaking of which this guy theyve got playing daario now has no swaggerâ he seems like the male lead in a sandra bullock movie i agree i loved huisman in nashville but i have much trouble adapting to this new daario skrein seemed so much more like a daario to me â in mentioning the templesperhaps we are due to meet the green grace soon were the temples mentionned i didnt hear that edited by tixu oty 20 may 2014  0335 am"
"Caerl Targaryen",2014-05-20,"im not convinced daario will betray dany so early he has no reason to do so when hes getting sexy time with his silver queen i mean hed be a fool to betray her now i expect him to betray her when the wedding to hizdahr becomes a reality that seems more dramatically appropriate i dont recall hearing about the temples at all just the vague revenge killings that werent elaborated on im having difficulty with huisman as daario too its amplified by his excellent work on orphan black this season admittedly he was given far more interesting material on that and far more screen time he also doesnt need to fake a british accent on that show and it greatly improves his performance never seen nashville so i dont have an opinion on that edited by caerl targaryen 20 may 2014  0625 am"

"Caerl Targaryen",2014-05-20,"â exactly and exactly if daario betrays dany which seems pretty likely hell do it when thing start looking pretty uglyâ not only about hizdahr but also on the war front definitely it seems clear that theyve set him up to fill the role of ben plumm in addition to strong belwas and maybe others so his betrayal is inevitable given that daarios arc in adwd works especially well with this particular change im not a huge fan of the idea of him betraying dany like this because it does seem a bit too cliched but its a convenient simplification that gets the job done and its nowhere near as bad as what they did to danys arc in season 2"

"Mad Monkey",2014-05-20,"i think you can keep the momentum going while portraying danys storyline in meereen the tv show has the opportunity to do something that i think the book should have done which is to show the situation deteriorating on the ground from the pov of someone on the ground instead of just having dany sitting on her throne listening to intelligence reports from reznak why not have shots of battles in the street freedmen clashing with masters harpys sons slaying unsullied people arguing for and against daenerys this could be a good way to expand the roles of grey worm or missandei having them act as danys eyes and ears on the ground or having them do it on their own reallythey could do a lot without having to worry about changing things from the book and it could be as fastpaced and kinetic as the crasters keep mission which i honestly enjoyed part of the problem i had with the adwd storyline was that it was very sedentary i dont think dany left the pyramid even once until she married hizdahr it robbed the shadow way of assassinations and intrigue in meereen of most of its excitement since all of it was relayed secondhand to her after the fact this was logical for the books but it would make for terrible tv"

"Caerl Targaryen",2014-05-20,"theres no reason why they cant show us whats happening in the city reports worked in the book because grrm wanted it to feel as though everything was spiraling closer and closer to dany and she becomes more and more trapped as the book goes until drogon swoops in and saves her its only then that she finds herself with povs he could convey that sense of claustrophobia and the enemies moving closer and closer quite nicely that approach wont work on tv not directly anyway there are plenty of ways they can give that same feeling to viewers but to do that they need to spend time setting it up they need to establish the players beyond just hizdahr andwell hizdahr thats something they havent bothered to do yet and its unfortunate they could have easily kept the crasters keep material if they absolutely had to i still think it was rather worthless but they could have trimmed it down some they spent a huge block of time over two episodes on that even cutting it down by 5 minutes hell cut it by 3 minutes to give danys story room to breathe a little would have been enough they even gave dany a small council meeting not long after she captured meereen that would have been a great opportunity to really drive home the problems meereen is facing instead they made it all about her decision to stay thats fine but they made it all about astapor and yunkai when clearly meereen is having problems too they could have used the problems in meereen in addition to the reports from astapor and yunkai to really sell danys decision it was a huge missed opportunity in that episode i agree that qarth and meereen are mostly about danys arc but so far they arent doing that meereen is just a locale that dany is hanging out in we dont even know the state of the city beyond a throwaway line weve had two meereenese in the story so far and both were supplicants thats poor writing introducing a single meereenese that tries to side with dany would go a long way towards helping to give meereen its own voice i hope we eventually get that edited by caerl targaryen 20 may 2014  1157 am"
"DaveyJoe",2014-05-20,"i dont think they want to show meereen spiraling out of control because that will be her season 5 arcâ i think this season is all about dany going from conquer mode to ruler modeâ throughout the season shes realizing that ruling isnt as easy as conquering and it will end with her chaining up the dragons and accepting that shes made some mistakes in her slavers bay diplomacyâ season 5 will be about fixing shit in meereen"
"Caerl Targaryen",2014-05-20,"they dont need to show a ton of it establishing that there are problems in the city beyond some throwaway lines would help set up her arc next season what were getting like we have all season with essos is core plot points reduced to a handful of lines with very little depth in short everything in danys arc is horribly rushed this season good writers should be able to write thematically relevant material to set things up for the next chapter by continuing to develop the characters they give other characters tons of quieter moments and just give dany badass scenes these days this isnt good writing the point is theyre rushing her material because theyre spending too much time on other stuff they arent even establishing her situation very well with the time theyre devoting to her her story is mostly an afterthought this season the latest episode has done some to alleviate that feeling and thats a good thing but we still have large gaps when it comes to whats going on edited by caerl targaryen 20 may 2014  1212 pm"
"DaveyJoe",2014-05-20,"but think about the big picture after season 5 theyll have spent 3 seasons in slaverys bayâ thats a huge amount of time and the viewers are seriously going to get fed up with danys story before long"
"Caerl Targaryen",2014-05-20,"i am thinking of the big picture im just not seeing how rushing through the introduction of meereen in the current season will make this part of danys arc meaningful to people i thought they did a pretty poor job justifying why dany decided to stay sure they introduced the problems in astapor and yunkai pretty much through short infodumps but they didnt think to mention that meereen was actually having problems too and then when we finally hear about one of the problems meereen is facing its in a nonspecific throwaway line in a scene more concerned with showing michiel huismans ass its justmeh obviously it was a good scene for multiple reasons i loved how dany was in control like that and obviously it was good for people that wanted to see huismans ass but beyond that the scene felt a bit emptysince they were already planning to have a few of the early adwd dany chapters in this season with the other meereen scenes being invented to act as a bridge between conquering dany and ruling dany there have been missed opportunities to flesh out why we should care about danys decision to staytheyve done a good job explaining what dany wants to do theyve just done a poor job explaining why theyve glossed over all of the problems she has with the freed slaves at this point in the story and theyve reduced the whole mother angle to people lifting and carrying her on their shoulders those lucky lucky extras which got the message across i suppose but it was rather cheesy too the what is important but the why is even more important they have the what down just fine they just havent done a good job with the why this has been a pretty consistent problem with her arc this season hope that makes more sense side note barristan and jorah should have been immediately dismissed for allowing the last known targaryen to go into a crowd of people without an escort that just didnt make sense at all edited by caerl targaryen 20 may 2014  0208 pm"
"Faceless Man Friday",2014-05-20,"i was referring to what has been described as a throw away line scene when i said that scene in an earlier post â i was pointing out that in the books they informed us of the revenge killings through the supplicants but since the show only had the goat herder and hizzie i thought the show just wanted you to get a sense that not all is well in the city by mentioning the revenge killings in the scene that was shown â my main point was to distinguish the revenge killings from the sons of harpy attacks which have not yet started in the show â someones post seemed to infer that the revenge killings were the harpy attacks and i do not think they are â the revenge killings are just that the revenge killings that were briefly mentioned in both the book and the show â i believe the show played it correctly by just mentioning them in passing as i do not believe they warrant any more attention â but by trying to point that out i have already brought much more attention than deserved either in the books or the showâ"
"Shebara",2014-05-20,"i also think there will be a great change in the mereen plot  well they did not introduce the green grace who is probably the harpy but somehow they will arrive at danaerys flying on drogon and at the battle of firei am sure of that"

"SixPence",2014-05-18,"best way to reveal uncat and tywin would be to do them both in the last episode at the end those would make for some epic cliffhangers episode 9 ending with varys freeing tyrion from the prison and showing him the way to the tunnels then it would cut as though he had then escaped no more kl for episode 10 mainly focusing on the wildling attack â then at the end theres the stannistotherescue scene before it cuts to the scene where uncat has the frey hung and she doesnt turn and show her identity until just before the end credits â end credits roll then afterwards there will be a short sequence with tyrion and tywin on the shitter and cut season"

"Hodor's Dragon",2014-05-19,"i was a little disappointed in the scene to tell the truth â i thought it was a bit rushed â sansa needed at least another 60 seconds to establish the emotional weight of the castlebuilding scene before robin showed up maybe more and there was filler material in this episode that couldve been sacrificed to make room hello shirtless mountain â i was very disappointed that there was not another person in this room because littlefingers this singers killed my lady wife is a very nice zinger to end the scene on and it couldve just as well been this servant or whatever â ties up all the loose ends with one quick fancy bow because youâ knowâ sansas going to go along with his story â â also  i dont have the book text in front of me so maybe someone can correct me but werent the movements choreographed in the book such that was a little more organic that littlefinger should be standing there with lysa in his arms next to the moon door and not quite so obvious that he had moved over there to kill her â on the show you would have to have been a little bit dense not to see what was coming â only cat was kind of low down my list of criticisms of the scene but i do think its a better line than the one they used â im not saying the scene was bad but it couldve been better and the production values have been so high this season that i was expecting better"

"sj4iy",2014-05-20," all they would have had to do is alter what lf said to sansa slightly in the scene right before the last one if people cant remember character names in one scene to the next and dont remember cats terrible death in one of the biggest episodes of the series im not sure theres much hope for them anyway â and just how many people called her cat â it was a pet name give by only those very close to her â she was called mother and lady stark much more than she was ever called cat"

"phedre",2014-05-20,"well to me by specifically using sister its like saying not you but the better version of you â yes â i actually liked your sister i have the feeling in some way i think its even worse for lysa than cat because it also degrades herself to being the worse copy of her sister as referring to cat as the sister makes her the other sister thus defining her not even as a own personality but just the attachment to someone so shes not even a general second choice but just by chance related to the one lf actually loved to me that seems like a dagger in the heart even more â this exactly by saying your sister hes driving home to lysa that his onetruelove is notlysa which makes it even harsher i loved the change"

"Blockfetcher",2014-05-20,"i just reread the whole only cat bit in the book and theres quite a lot of dialogue going on which they could have used to extend the scene maybe its a time issue so they just skim a lot of the dialogue and get to the point but it does make me wonder why they dont just use the dialogue already there in the book the dialogue is just as catchy and simple to understand and surely it makes their jobs a bit easier if they can just copy and paste the things that are being said into the screenplay the whole adapting process is something im pretty interested in knowing more about especially what bits of conversation are considered ok to put in the show directly and what bits need to be tweaked"
